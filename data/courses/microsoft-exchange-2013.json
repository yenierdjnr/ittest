2013.\n\n3\n00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:14.872\nWe've had a lot of request from viewers\nout there from people implementing their\n\n4\n00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:17.400\nown email systems and\nthey're choosing Microsoft Exchange.\n\n5\n00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.410\nThey want some help to be able to do that.\n\n6\n00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.640\nSo that's what this series\nis kinda built around.\n\n7\n00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.030\nNow we're using the exam objectives for\nthe 70-341 exam to\n\n8\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.410\nbuild this episode series, just to\nmake sure we cover all that content.\n\n9\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.140\nBecause it really is a great way\nto get introduced to the product,\n\n10\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.140\nas well as to get it implemented\nquickly and reliably.\n\n11\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.140\nNow that means that we're gonna cover a\nlot of great stuff to get you exam ready,\n\n12\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.690\nbut from a practical sense\nwhat are we gonna cover?\n\n13\n00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.910\nWell, in this series we're going to take a\nlook at how to select the right edition of\n\n14\n00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.050\nMicrosoft Exchange, how to get Exchange\ninstalled and have the right amount of\n\n15\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.060\nservers for your environment, get that\nnetwork design properly put in place.\n\n16\n00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.944\nHow to implement mailbox services, which\nis probably the most important part of\n\n17\n00:00:56.944 --> 00:00:58.890\nan email server is to\nbe able to send email.\n\n18\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.140\nBut also take a look\nat the calendaring and\n\n19\n00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.460\nother functionality that's\nbuilt inside of Exchange.\n\n20\n00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.660\nThere is a ton of power under\nthe hood of Exchange that makes it\n\n21\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.560\nfar more than an email server.\n\n22\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.660\nAnd we're gonna take a look\nat all of that, right.\n\n23\n00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.790\nLet's take a look at the exam\nobjectives to get a look at some of\n\n24\n00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.080\nthe things we're gonna cover.\n\n25\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.690\nI said we were gonna build this\naround the 70-341 exam and\n\n26\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.610\nyou'll see that it breaks\nthings up into four categories.\n\n27\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.380\nInstalling and\nconfiguring the mailbox role, right.\n\n28\n00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.880\nThat's the email portion, right.\n\n29\n00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.610\nGetting email set up.\n\n30\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.246\nInstalling and\nconfiguring the client access role.\n\n31\n00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:35.770\nThat's getting POP3, IMAP4, the Outlook\nWeb App, getting those things configured,\n\n32\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.140\nas well as the full Microsoft Outlook\nclient and some of the advanced\n\n33\n00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.950\nfunctionality we get with it, seeing how\nto get those implemented and put in place.\n\n34\n00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.751\nThen we're going to move into\ninstalling and configuring transport.\n\n35\n00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.277\nNow, by transport we mean what\nhappens to our email while it moves\n\n36\n00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:51.440\nacross the network.\n\n37\n00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.879\nAnd that might sound pretty boring, but\nthis is where we do things like anti-spam,\n\n38\n00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:56.700\nanti-virus.\n\n39\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.270\nWe can do compliance or\n\n40\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.370\nregulatory compliance type rules where you\ndo email retention or redirecting email.\n\n41\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.470\nThere's a lot of stuff you can do\nto email while it's in transit.\n\n42\n00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.590\nIt might be really complex things or\nreally simple,\n\n43\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.250\nlike sticking a footer on the bottom\nthat says, this is a private email,\n\n44\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.500\nplease do not disclose it,\nor something of that nature.\n\n45\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.880\nThere's a lot we can do there.\n\n46\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.880\nWe'll see how to manage our\nmessage queues, and so on.\n\n47\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.120\nAnd then we've got designing and\nmanaging an Exchange infrastructure.\n\n48\n00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.560\nWhen you start to build this out,\nyou'll find that small environments\n\n49\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.320\nhave very different needs\nfrom large environments.\n\n50\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.940\nIf you just have one Exchange\nadministrator and 20 mailboxes,\n\n51\n00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.900\nyou can have a really straightforward and\nsimple Exchange deployment.\n\n52\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.910\nBut if you have 50,000 users and\n\n53\n00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.080\nten Exchange administrators, well, now\nthings get a lot more complex and so we'll\n\n54\n00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.040\nlook at some of the functionality that's\nbuilt into Exchange that supports that.\n\n55\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.970\nSo, all in all,\n\n56\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.980\nit's gonna be a really good series\ncovering all the information you need.\n\n57\n00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.400\nIf you wanna get certified, great.\n\n58\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.240\nWe're gonna cover all the objectives.\n\n59\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.412\nIf you're not interested in getting\ncertified, that's fine too.\n\n60\n00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:56.980\nWe're gonna show you what you\nneed to know about Exchange to\n\n61\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.750\nget it deployed in your environment,\nand to be able to take\n\n62\n00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.990\nadvantage of the really cool features\nthat are new in Exchange 2013.\n\n63\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.960\nSo, if that sounds interesting to you,\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n64\n00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.456\nStay tuned, we've got\nMicrosoft Exchange 2013 coming up next.\n\n65\n00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:17.249\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.270\nAnd welcome back for\nanother episode of ITProTV, I'm your host,\n\n4\n00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.280\nDon Pezet, here today with an episode for\nMicrosoft Exchange 2013.\n\n5\n00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.970\nAnd I'm excited to kick this series off.\n\n6\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.420\nExchange is a very popular\ne-mail server program.\n\n7\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.190\nA lot of companies and enterprises run it.\n\n8\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.750\nThere's a ton of ways to\nget involved with it, and\n\n9\n00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.170\nin this episode I just want\nto spend some time kind\n\n10\n00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.970\nof describing what Exchange is and\nhow we go about purchasing it.\n\n11\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.300\nCuz unfortunately it has gotten\na little bit confusing these days.\n\n12\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.480\nSo there's a lot of companies that use\nemail, I shouldn't say a lot of companies,\n\n13\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.980\npretty much every company\nuses email these days.\n\n14\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.750\nIt might be completely private and\ninternal, it might be public and\n\n15\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.870\nconnectivity to the Internet.\n\n16\n00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.760\nThat's the most common, right.\n\n17\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.080\nBut we need email, and one of the best\nemail solutions that's out there\n\n18\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.840\nis Microsoft Exchange, and\nit's not sure because of the email side.\n\n19\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.640\nThere's plenty of email\nservers that are out there,\n\n20\n00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.800\nyou could fire up a Linux server\nwith Sendmail, and there you go,\n\n21\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.140\nyou got an email server and\nit didn't cost you a dime.\n\n22\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.670\nSo why would I pay for Microsoft Exchange?\n\n23\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.760\nWhy would I implement that,\nover some of these other solutions?\n\n24\n00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.590\nAnd the answer is, the collaboration\nservices that come along with it.\n\n25\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.390\nExchange is a lot more\nthan just a mail server.\n\n26\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.860\nFor example, it gives you shared group\ncalendars and individual calendaring.\n\n27\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.130\nYou can do tasks, like to-do lists.\n\n28\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.020\nYou can do unified messaging, where your\nvoicemail goes right into Exchange and\n\n29\n00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.060\nis managed there.\n\n30\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.510\nYou can do public folders for\n\n31\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.100\nshared content and files,\nExchange can do a lot of things.\n\n32\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.560\nIt's a very powerful collaboration suite.\n\n33\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.640\nIn fact Microsoft sometimes\ncalls it collaboration suite.\n\n34\n00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.020\nThey don't say email server ,cuz\nit does so much more than email.\n\n35\n00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.850\nAnd those are all reasons why we might\nchose to implement Microsoft exchange,\n\n36\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.080\nas opposed to going with some of the other\nservices that are out there, all right?\n\n37\n00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.500\nSo, let's say you're at a company, and\n\n38\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.510\nyou're evaluating whether\nyou want Microsoft Exchange.\n\n39\n00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.770\nYou say, all right, I think we're\ngoing to do an email server and\n\n40\n00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.570\nwe're looking at going this\nExchange route, right?\n\n41\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.220\nSo, there's some of the reasons that I\njust mentioned a moment ago that you might\n\n42\n00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.170\nwant to choose Exchange for.\n\n43\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.750\nThere's other reasons too.\n\n44\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.890\nFor example,\nit's really easy to administer.\n\n45\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.090\nExchange has a nice\ngraphical user interface.\n\n46\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.010\nIt's all web based.\n\n47\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.960\nYou browse to a web page,\nyou can configure the server,\n\n48\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.070\nyou do everything that\nyou need right there.\n\n49\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.040\nIt's pretty straight forward.\n\n50\n00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.350\nAnd you'll see through out this series,\nthat configuring,\n\n51\n00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.670\nit's really not that hard.\n\n52\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.820\nYou do need to know where things are,\nand that's a bit of a challenge, right.\n\n53\n00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.200\nOr understand the terminology\nthat Microsoft uses.\n\n54\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.470\nBut once you get past that,\n\n55\n00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.210\nactually performing the activities\nis not difficult at all.\n\n56\n00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.900\nAnd it's It's actually a pretty\ngreat system to work with.\n\n57\n00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.670\nIt's also extremely scalable.\n\n58\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.220\nExchange can run and\nsupport five mailboxes if you want.\n\n59\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.690\nAll right?\nI just have five mailboxes,\n\n60\n00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.010\nI'm running it from my home.\n\n61\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.750\nBut that might be a little overkill there,\nbut you could do it.\n\n62\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.930\nOr my company has 500,000 employees and\nI need mailboxes for all of them.\n\n63\n00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.250\nExchange can do that.\n\n64\n00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.450\nIt can run in very small,\nvery large environments, and\n\n65\n00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.840\nyou can even host it online through\nMicrosoft's Azure if you want.\n\n66\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.810\nRight, so there's a few different\nsolutions that are out there.\n\n67\n00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.420\nOne of the first decisions you\nhave to make with Exchange,\n\n68\n00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.635\nis whether you're gonna go with\nthe standard or enterprise edition.\n\n69\n00:03:10.635 --> 00:03:13.705\nSo when you buy Microsoft Exchange,\nthere's a few things we have to think\n\n70\n00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:16.365\nabout, and\none of those is the features that we want.\n\n71\n00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:18.535\nThe features are divided up\na couple of different ways,\n\n72\n00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:20.495\nand that's part of where\nthe confusion comes from.\n\n73\n00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:24.525\nThe other thing we have to decide,\nis whether we want just one server, or\n\n74\n00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:26.465\nif we want more than one server.\n\n75\n00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:29.770\nIf you just have five mailboxes,\nyou can run one exchange server.\n\n76\n00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.810\nYou can have one server.\n\n77\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.680\nIt can be a virtual machine.\n\n78\n00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.930\nIt doesn't have to be a physical machine.\n\n79\n00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.440\nAnd it can run exchange.\n\n80\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.990\nIt can provide all your e-mail services.\n\n81\n00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.620\nCalendaring, public folders,\nall that good stuff, right on one box.\n\n82\n00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.100\nBut if you've got a large company.\n\n83\n00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.960\nIf you've got thousands of employees,\n\n84\n00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.620\nthat one box is gonna get\nkilled pretty fast, right?\n\n85\n00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.380\nIt's gonna need storage to\nsupport all those mailboxes.\n\n86\n00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.850\nIt's gonna need CPU to move email in and\nout.\n\n87\n00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.540\nIt's gonna need RAM to process\nall the mail requests.\n\n88\n00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.485\nAnd it's gonna need network bandwidth,\nto be able to move files and\n\n89\n00:03:57.485 --> 00:03:58.825\nthings back and forth.\n\n90\n00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:00.895\nThat's a lot for one server to do.\n\n91\n00:04:00.895 --> 00:04:04.395\nSo in enterprise environments,\nwe actually break Exchange up and\n\n92\n00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:06.095\nspread it across several servers.\n\n93\n00:04:06.095 --> 00:04:09.765\nI think the largest environment I've\nworked in had about 30 exchange servers,\n\n94\n00:04:09.765 --> 00:04:12.375\nall divided up performing\ndifferent functions, and\n\n95\n00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:15.295\nthat was just because of\nthe size of that organization.\n\n96\n00:04:15.295 --> 00:04:17.900\nOr if you're organization\nis just geographically big.\n\n97\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.320\nMaybe you've got some employees\nin the United States, and\n\n98\n00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.130\nsome employees in England.\n\n99\n00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.860\nWell, you don't want the employees\nin England to have to jump\n\n100\n00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.000\nall the way over to the U.S.\nto access their mailbox.\n\n101\n00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.780\nIt would be nice if we had an Exchange\nserver over there in England, and\n\n102\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.320\nan Exchange server over here in the U.S,.\n\n103\n00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.840\nAnd now people can access\nthe server that's closest to them.\n\n104\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.750\nExchange lets you do that, right?\n\n105\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.520\nWe do have to think about how many\ncopies of Exchange we need to buy, and\n\n106\n00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.090\nhow many servers we want.\n\n107\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.980\nBut when you go to buy it, the first\ndecision you have to make is whether we\n\n108\n00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.570\nwant Standard or Enterprise right.\n\n109\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.430\nNow with the standard addition you get\n\n110\n00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.200\nall the core functionality you\nneed from Microsoft Exchange.\n\n111\n00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.280\nWith the enterprise addition\nyou get some extra stuff.\n\n112\n00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.130\nAnd let me show you.\nI've got Microsoft's page pulled\n\n113\n00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.920\nup right here.\n\n114\n00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.540\nThis is the page that discusses\nthe Exchange 2013 licensing.\n\n115\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.320\nAnd you'll see right here at the top,\n\n116\n00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.960\nits got a little note about Standard and\nEnterprise.\n\n117\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.510\nWell there's actually only one difference\nbetween Standard and Enterprise, and\n\n118\n00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.500\nthat's how many mailbox\ndatabases you can have.\n\n119\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.250\nIf you're a single company, and\nyou've got say less than 50,000 users,\n\n120\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.600\nyou can probably get away with\njust having one mailbox database.\n\n121\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.450\nBut if you want to divide your\nmailbox databases up, and\n\n122\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.120\nhave some mailboxes in England some\nin the U.S. and some in Australia.\n\n123\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.820\nOr you've got more than one company,\nand you want the different\n\n124\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.730\nbusiness units to have their own database,\nwell then you're going to need more.\n\n125\n00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.710\nAnd the Standard addition can only\nsupport up to five mailbox databases.\n\n126\n00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.040\nSo, if I just need five mailbox databases,\nstandard addition,\n\n127\n00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.440\nit'll do what I need and that's that.\n\n128\n00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.180\nRight.\nThen there's the enterprise edition.\n\n129\n00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.620\nAnd the Enterprise edition,\nif you bought Exchange 2013 on a DVD,\n\n130\n00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.690\nout of the box it supports\nup to 50 mailbox databases.\n\n131\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.000\nBut if you've installed\nall the Windows updates,\n\n132\n00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.600\nwhen they released service pack one,\nit bumped it up to 100 mailbox databases.\n\n133\n00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.910\nSo you could divide up all your email\ninto all these different databases.\n\n134\n00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.900\nNow I, why would I want to do that?\n\n135\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.590\nWell, I gave you guys\nthe example of a geolocation.\n\n136\n00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.140\nPutting people's email closer to them.\n\n137\n00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.790\nThat makes access to their mailbox faster.\n\n138\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.030\nThat's something you might want, right?\n\n139\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.160\nThat's one reason you might divide it up.\n\n140\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.300\nAnother reason you might divide\nit up is backup and recovery.\n\n141\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.760\nRight?\nIf I have 50 thousand mailboxes and\n\n142\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.190\nthey're all in one database, and\n\n143\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.480\nthat database fails, all of my\nusers can't access their mailbox.\n\n144\n00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.287\nBut if I divided that up into\nfive mailbox databases, right?\n\n145\n00:06:36.287 --> 00:06:40.030\nTen thousand users in each of those five\ndatabases, and one of them fails, well,\n\n146\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.680\nthe other four are still up and going.\n\n147\n00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.100\nAnd I can even transition\nmailboxes over to the other one,\n\n148\n00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.450\nto get them up and going too.\n\n149\n00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.410\nIt creates a more resilient,\nmore redundant environment.\n\n150\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.940\nAnd so\nEnterprise will come in handy there.\n\n151\n00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.770\nNow we're gonna cover in\nanother episode the different\n\n152\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.400\nroles that Exchange can\ntake when you install it.\n\n153\n00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.170\nAnd when you install Exchange, there's\ntwo main roles we need to worry about.\n\n154\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.770\nThere's a client access server and\na mailbox server.\n\n155\n00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.630\nThe mailbox server, that's the one\nthat holds the database, and\n\n156\n00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.890\nthat's where these limits come in.\n\n157\n00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.440\nSo the Atandard mailbox server\ncan hold up to five mailboxes.\n\n158\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.290\nThe Enterprise mailbox\nserver can hold up to 100.\n\n159\n00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.770\nBut a client access server,\n\n160\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.950\nthat's the server where your\nend users actual connect.\n\n161\n00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.890\nIt's where they use POP3 or IMAP.\n\n162\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.110\nIt's where they use OWA.\n\n163\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.900\nThey're using the Outlook Web App\nto access their mailbox.\n\n164\n00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.080\nThey go through that client access server.\n\n165\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.110\nAnd if you've got a dedicated\nclient access server,\n\n166\n00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.850\nit doesn't have any mailboxes.\n\n167\n00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.530\nIf it doesn't have any mailboxes It\ndoesn't matter which one you get, so\n\n168\n00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.350\nyou might as well save money and\nget the Standard edition.\n\n169\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.290\nSo this really only applies\nto our mailbox servers.\n\n170\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.086\nAnd that's really, honestly and truly\nthe only difference between Standard and\n\n171\n00:07:44.086 --> 00:07:44.754\nEnterprise.\n\n172\n00:07:44.754 --> 00:07:47.535\nSo if you've got less than\nfive mailbox databases,\n\n173\n00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:49.630\ndon't waste any money on Enterprise.\n\n174\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.952\nYou don't get any extra features.\n\n175\n00:07:51.952 --> 00:07:54.099\nThat wasn't always the case.\n\n176\n00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.591\nIn older versions of Exchange,\n\n177\n00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:58.860\nit used to be if you wanted clustering\nyou had to go to Enterprise.\n\n178\n00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:59.982\nOr if you wanted this feature or\n\n179\n00:07:59.982 --> 00:08:02.845\nthat feature there were things where you\nhad to jump up to Enterprise, right?\n\n180\n00:08:02.845 --> 00:08:04.550\nExtra memory access and things like that.\n\n181\n00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.620\nThat's all gone.\n\n182\n00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.620\nNow they're identical except for\nthe mailbox databases.\n\n183\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.780\nThe differences are now tied to what's\ncalled a client access license.\n\n184\n00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.570\nWith Exchange you have to pay for\nthe server software.\n\n185\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.980\nSo I have to buy a copy of Exchange 2013.\n\n186\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.520\nBut then, for\nevery user that connects to the server,\n\n187\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.140\nI can have a client access license or\na CAL.\n\n188\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.250\nAnd the CAL comes in two forms,\na Standard CAL and an Enterprise CAL, and\n\n189\n00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.230\nthere's a lot of differences between them,\nall right?\n\n190\n00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.968\nNow the Enterprise CAL\nis more of an add-on.\n\n191\n00:08:34.968 --> 00:08:38.810\nSo at a minimum,\nyou need a Standard CAL for\n\n192\n00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.190\nevery single user that's\ngonna have a mailbox.\n\n193\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.470\nSo if I have 50,000 users, at a minimum\nI'm gonna need 50,000 Standard CALs,\n\n194\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.600\nall right?\n\n195\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.180\nThen if I want some of the advanced\nfunctionality, I can pick and\n\n196\n00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.800\nchoose with my Ennterprise CALs.\n\n197\n00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.020\nAnd I can say, I got 50,000 users, but\n\n198\n00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.220\nthere's only 5,000 of my users\nthat need this one feature.\n\n199\n00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.420\nI'll just buy Enterprise CALs for\nthose 5,000 users and that's it.\n\n200\n00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.520\nAnd so,\nthose users will have both a standard and\n\n201\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.690\nan Enterprise CAL to add together.\n\n202\n00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.830\nSo when we look at this licensing page,\nit starts off real simple.\n\n203\n00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.130\nHere's the difference between Standard and\nEnterprise.\n\n204\n00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.700\nThen it gets real complex.\n\n205\n00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.350\nWhen it jumps into the client CALs or\nthe client access licences, right?\n\n206\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.460\nNow it starts to list all these different\nfeatures that come with the Standard CAL\n\n207\n00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.440\nand that come with a Standard\nplus Enterprise CAL.\n\n208\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.010\nNotice how it doesn't just say\nEnterprise CAL by itself, right?\n\n209\n00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.240\nYou have to have both a Standard and\n\n210\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.920\nan Enterprise combined to\nget the Enterprise features.\n\n211\n00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.190\nSo the first set here is we look at things\nlike email, calendar, contacts, and\n\n212\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.130\ntasks, right?\n\n213\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:41.930\nThey both have that.\n\n214\n00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.051\nIf I just need basic email functionality,\nthese are identical.\n\n215\n00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:50.199\nIf we want Outlook Web App, it we want\nadvanced Outlook functionality, if we want\n\n216\n00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:55.590\nsite mailboxes, role based access control,\nthose are in Standard and Enterprise.\n\n217\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.466\nYou don't need an Enterprise account for\nthose,\n\n218\n00:09:57.466 --> 00:09:59.261\nthey just come as part of Standard,\nall right?\n\n219\n00:09:59.261 --> 00:10:02.680\nBut then as we scroll down you'll start\nto notice sorta the differences creep up.\n\n220\n00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.130\nWe'll see things like journaling,\nunified messaging and so on.\n\n221\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.070\nThese are part of the Enterprise CAL,\nright?\n\n222\n00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.130\nI mentioned unified messaging let's\ntalk about that for a second.\n\n223\n00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:17.080\nIf you have a voice over IP system, most\npeople have a voice over IP system that is\n\n224\n00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.270\ncompletely separate from their email,\ntwo separate things.\n\n225\n00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.650\nBut, remember how I called\nExchange a collaboration suite?\n\n226\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.510\nIt's designed to help people communicate,\nright?\n\n227\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.030\nWe wanna put these pieces together and\n\n228\n00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:32.110\nhelp people communicate through\nwhatever means, not just email.\n\n229\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.610\nSo with the full collaboration suite,\nwe can send email,\n\n230\n00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.130\nwe can do a voice over IP call,\nwe can do a meeting, right?\n\n231\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.780\nA screen share type meeting or\na video meeting, and\n\n232\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.380\nwe can do interaction with voicemail.\n\n233\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.530\nAll through Microsoft Outlook.\n\n234\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.358\nIt's done with unified messaging.\n\n235\n00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:52.030\nUnified messaging lets you\nconnect your exchange environment\n\n236\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.840\nwith your voice over IP environment.\n\n237\n00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.410\nSo now when that voicemail comes in,\nyou get it right there in your inbox.\n\n238\n00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.930\nAnd when you schedule a meeting inside of\nOutlook, it can set a conference number\n\n239\n00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.330\nthrough your voice over IP system and\nit can tie it all together.\n\n240\n00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.380\nAnd when you click on that\ncontact to call somebody,\n\n241\n00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.350\nit can actually dial right from\ninside of Outlook and place the call.\n\n242\n00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.970\nIt's really neat stuff.\n\n243\n00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.690\nBut not all our users need that.\n\n244\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.730\nYou might have some mailboxes\nthat are just service mailboxes.\n\n245\n00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.070\nThey don't actually have\nemployees tied to them.\n\n246\n00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.280\nThey don't need a phone.\n\n247\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.700\nSo for those, what you would do is\nyou would say, for those mailboxes,\n\n248\n00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.650\njust the regular mailboxes,\nI would stick with the Standard license.\n\n249\n00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:30.630\nBut then for anybody who had a VOIP\nextension, I would get them a Standard and\n\n250\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.680\nan Enterprise CAL, and that's what would\ngive them the ability to use that unified\n\n251\n00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.290\nmessaging piece, all right?\n\n252\n00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.990\nSo you have to think about this,\ncuz it is expensive, right?\n\n253\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.420\nThis is adding to the cost,\n\n254\n00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.228\nit over doubles the cost of that user when\nyou bump them up to an Enterprise CAL.\n\n255\n00:11:44.228 --> 00:11:47.840\nSo you've gotta look down here and\nsay, do I need these features?\n\n256\n00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.530\nDo I need In-Place Archive?\n\n257\n00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:50.890\nDo I need In-Place Hold?\n\n258\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.720\nDo I need some of these advanced features?\n\n259\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.703\nAll right, well I don't want to spend\na ton of time diving into these,\n\n260\n00:11:55.703 --> 00:11:58.043\ncuz we're gonna see them\nall throughout this series.\n\n261\n00:11:58.043 --> 00:12:00.840\nBut let me just hit a couple\nof highlights here, right?\n\n262\n00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.550\nThe number one reason that you go for an\nEnterprise account is unified messaging.\n\n263\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.563\nUnified messaging is\na big part of that and so\n\n264\n00:12:06.563 --> 00:12:09.467\nthat's why I singled that one out first,\nall right?\n\n265\n00:12:09.467 --> 00:12:12.794\nThere's a few other things,\nthough, like journaling, okay?\n\n266\n00:12:12.794 --> 00:12:16.130\nJournaling, notice here I've got\nthis journaling per database.\n\n267\n00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.924\nWhat journaling is is basically keeping\na record of users emails, all right?\n\n268\n00:12:20.924 --> 00:12:24.067\nHere in the United States right now\nthere's a little bit of controversy over\n\n269\n00:12:24.067 --> 00:12:26.819\na certain politician who maintained\ntheir own mailbox database,\n\n270\n00:12:26.819 --> 00:12:30.600\ntheir own mailbox server, outside of\nwhat the government normally provided.\n\n271\n00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.640\nAnd so now,\n\n272\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.880\nthere's not a reliable record of\nthe emails that were sent by that person.\n\n273\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.020\nWell, if you have regulatory compliance,\nif you have rules to dictate,\n\n274\n00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.935\nyou've got to save emails,\nhow do you keep a record of that?\n\n275\n00:12:42.935 --> 00:12:46.550\nJournaling, in the Standard\nedition of Exchange,\n\n276\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.420\nwe can do journaling per database, so\n\n277\n00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.110\nyou can say, journal everyone in this\ndatabase or no one in this database.\n\n278\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.330\nBut if we go to an Enterprise CAL,\nwe can pick out individual people.\n\n279\n00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.520\nSo we can say, hey,\n\n280\n00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.360\nthe CEO of our company, we wanna\nretain their email for five years.\n\n281\n00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.260\nBut the mailroom clerk,\nwe wanna retain their email for 30 days.\n\n282\n00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.730\nYou can get very, very specific.\n\n283\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.750\nYou can set these granular policies.\n\n284\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.090\nSo if you need journaling and\nretention policies like that,\n\n285\n00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.190\nthat are really granular,\nyou'll need to go to an Enterprise CAL.\n\n286\n00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.140\nAlso, we've got things\nlike retention policies,\n\n287\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.100\nwhich ties into the journaling, right,\nhow long we retain those messages, and\n\n288\n00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.110\neven setting which messages get retained.\n\n289\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.570\nNow I'm not talking about per user,\nI'm talking about per message.\n\n290\n00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.860\nI might say, any message that has this\nkeyword in it needs to be saved for\n\n291\n00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.499\nseven years.\n\n292\n00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.580\nWe've got In-Place Archive.\n\n293\n00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.680\nNow archive is a big deal.\n\n294\n00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.880\nIf you've run Outlook.\n\n295\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.530\nI mean, I remember running\nOutlook back in the 90s.\n\n296\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.940\nWhen you ran Microsoft Outlook your\nmailbox was all being backed up\n\n297\n00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.650\nto a PST file, right,\nthis PST file on your hard drive.\n\n298\n00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.800\nAs it grew and grew and grew,\nOutlook got slower and slower and slower.\n\n299\n00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.690\nAnd so people would archive.\n\n300\n00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.900\nAnd when you would archive it,\nit would take your email and\n\n301\n00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.880\nit would take it out of the mailbox and\nput it in a secondary file.\n\n302\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.870\nAnd it would say, all right we're\ngonna stick it over here and\n\n303\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.970\nmake your mailbox smaller,\nmake it faster, right?\n\n304\n00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.450\nAnd it did, that worked.\n\n305\n00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.120\nBut here was the problem,\nwhen people's email was on the server,\n\n306\n00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.530\ntheir server was being backed up, right?\n\n307\n00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.850\nAnd if the server failed,\nwe could always restore it.\n\n308\n00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.930\nThe server admins would back that up.\n\n309\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.880\nBut their laptop or their desktop\nmight not be getting backed up.\n\n310\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.640\nAnd when Outlook did an archive,\nit would archive right to their laptop or\n\n311\n00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.780\nright to their desktop, and\nit wouldn't get backed up anymore,\n\n312\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.030\nand people were losing email left and\nright.\n\n313\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.330\nYou can do a Google\nsearch on the Internet,\n\n314\n00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.150\nyou'll find tons of people saying,\nI lost my archive, Outlook sucks.\n\n315\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.620\nA lot of people complained about that.\n\n316\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.565\nAnd it's just because you're not\nstoring that archive safely.\n\n317\n00:14:35.565 --> 00:14:38.110\nIn-Place Archive solves that.\n\n318\n00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.820\nIt says, we're gonna allow people to\narchive their mailboxes to make them\n\n319\n00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.450\nsmaller, but instead of storing\nit on their laptop or desktop,\n\n320\n00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.010\nwe're gonna store it\nright here on the server.\n\n321\n00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.470\nNow, it might be in a different\nplace on the server.\n\n322\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:53.960\nWe might have 15,000 RPM SCSI drives\nthat are handling our mailbox database,\n\n323\n00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.760\nand we might have,\njust 5400 RPM SADA drives,\n\n324\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.220\nreally cheap hard drives,\nsitting over here for the archive.\n\n325\n00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.380\nSo it's slower storage.\n\n326\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.070\nIt's cheaper storage, but that's where the\narchive sits when we back that up, right?\n\n327\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.620\nWhen we know that it's on Raid 5 or\nRaid 10 or Razor, or whatever,\n\n328\n00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.410\nthat's got that protection in place.\n\n329\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:15.300\nSo now the server admins can protect\nall of your mail, your main mailbox and\n\n330\n00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.600\nyour archive, not just the main mailbox.\n\n331\n00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.560\nThat's a solution that comes\nwith the Enterprise CAL.\n\n332\n00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.880\nWe've got other things like In-Place Hold.\n\n333\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.510\nIn Exchange, by default,\nif you delete somebody's mailbox,\n\n334\n00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.340\nit'll hold onto it for 30 days.\n\n335\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.740\nAnd then after 30 days it gets rid\nof the mailbox, that's the default.\n\n336\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.285\nYou can manipulate that time.\n\n337\n00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:36.698\nIn Exchange 2013 with an Enterprise CAL,\nyou can define an In-Place Hold to say\n\n338\n00:15:36.698 --> 00:15:40.117\nwhen we delete an individual message,\nthat we wanna to hold it for\n\n339\n00:15:40.117 --> 00:15:43.620\na certain period of time and\nthe end user can't clear it out.\n\n340\n00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.547\nAnd we can even say that for\na whole mailbox if we want, or\n\n341\n00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:47.930\na whole mailbox database, so\nyou can get really powerful with that.\n\n342\n00:15:49.812 --> 00:15:52.406\nAll right, so\nthose are some of the bigger differences.\n\n343\n00:15:52.406 --> 00:15:53.295\nThere's other ones,\n\n344\n00:15:53.295 --> 00:15:56.259\nthey list a bunch of them like all\nthe rights management features and so on.\n\n345\n00:15:56.259 --> 00:15:59.102\nIf you want those,\nyou gotta go to an enterprise account.\n\n346\n00:15:59.102 --> 00:16:03.248\nBut if you don't need those, if you're\njust looking for email, calendar, tasks,\n\n347\n00:16:03.248 --> 00:16:06.380\nright, public folders,\nyou could do that with a standard CAL.\n\n348\n00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.910\nAnd at a minimum,\nyou're going to need one standard CAL for\n\n349\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.060\neach user mailbox on the server.\n\n350\n00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.090\nSo for everybody that's\ngonna be connecting to it.\n\n351\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:16.620\nAll right.\n\n352\n00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.250\nNow Exchange does kind of work\non an honor system, and so\n\n353\n00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.730\nit's up to you to track those numbers and\nthen if Microsoft ever audits you,\n\n354\n00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.280\nthen you've got to show that you've\npurchased the right amount of CALs.\n\n355\n00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.400\nIt doesn't really enforce\nit with an iron fist, so\n\n356\n00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.240\nthey're not gonna harp on\nyou too much about it.\n\n357\n00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.250\nBut you will get a little warning if\nyou've applied Enterprise features to more\n\n358\n00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.010\nusers than you have Enterprise CALs,\nyou'll get a warning about that.\n\n359\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.200\nIt'll let you know that you\ndon't have enough CALs.\n\n360\n00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:38.950\nAll right.\n\n361\n00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.630\nSo, when purchasing Exchange,\nour first decision is,\n\n362\n00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.100\ndo we go with Standard, or Enterprise?\n\n363\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.020\nAnd that comes strictly down to how\nmany mailbox databases we have.\n\n364\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.360\nAnd it only applies to\nthe mailbox servers.\n\n365\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.900\nSo, for our client access servers,\nfor our Edge servers,\n\n366\n00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.800\nthose you always do Standard,\nthere's no point in doing Enterprise.\n\n367\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.380\nBut on your mailbox server,\n\n368\n00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.299\nif you need more then five mailbox\ndatabases, you go Enterprise.\n\n369\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.020\nAnd then you pick your Cals.\n\n370\n00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.780\nAll of your users need a standard CAL, and\nthen for those advanced features I just\n\n371\n00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.600\ntalked about a moment ago, like unified\nmessaging, advanced journaling and so on.\n\n372\n00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.171\nIf you need those, you buy an Enterprise\nCAL for each user that's gonna need those\n\n373\n00:17:15.171 --> 00:17:19.031\nin addition to their standard CAL,\nright, they definitely add on.\n\n374\n00:17:19.031 --> 00:17:19.920\nAll right.\n\n375\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.080\nSo those are some of\nthe decisions we need to make.\n\n376\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.800\nThere is one other really big decision.\n\n377\n00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.240\nShould I even be installing\nExchange in the first place, right?\n\n378\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.540\nAnd I know it sounds kinda funny.\n\n379\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.490\nAnd I'm a server admin.\n\n380\n00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.570\nI've done it for years.\n\n381\n00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.330\nAnd this is one of those decisions that\nyou think might put you out of a job.\n\n382\n00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.370\nIt really doesn't,\n\n383\n00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:41.100\nwhich is [LAUGH] what if I choose to\njust throw it in the Cloud instead?\n\n384\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.430\nI could host Exchange.\n\n385\n00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.880\nI know how.\nI can bring up the servers.\n\n386\n00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.863\nI can install the software.\n\n387\n00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:46.890\nI can get an Exchange\nenvironment going on right now.\n\n388\n00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.680\nBut, I'm busy.\n\n389\n00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.080\nI don't have a lot of time on my hands.\n\n390\n00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.670\nI'm doing shows like this one.\n\n391\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.660\nSo, what happens if that server fails?\n\n392\n00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.340\nWhat happens if a new\nemployee gets hired and\n\n393\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.200\nI don't have time to create their mailbox?\n\n394\n00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.730\nWell, wouldn't it be nice if we\njust let somebody else handle it?\n\n395\n00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:01.330\nAnd you can do that.\n\n396\n00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.280\nSo, Microsoft has online.\n\n397\n00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.620\nYou can do it where it's hosted Exchange.\n\n398\n00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.340\nNow there's two ways to deploy it, right.\n\n399\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.880\nThere's one way,\nwhich is where you just use Azure VMs.\n\n400\n00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.320\nSo you bring up these virtual machines and\nMicrosoft Azure,\n\n401\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.360\nor Amazon web services or whoever.\n\n402\n00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.880\nAnd you deploy Exchange in there.\n\n403\n00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.930\nNow you're still managing that.\n\n404\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.090\nThe only difference there is you kinda\noutsourced your hardware, not the support,\n\n405\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:21.930\nyou're still supporting it.\n\n406\n00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.770\nBut an even better route is\nto go with Exchange Online.\n\n407\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.140\nLet me bring up their webpage right here.\n\n408\n00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.520\nMicrosoft Exchange Online is where\nthey handle everything for you.\n\n409\n00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.020\nThey take care of the servers.\n\n410\n00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.360\nThey take care of the provisioning.\n\n411\n00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.560\nThey take care of whether you have\na standard CAL or an Enterprise CAL.\n\n412\n00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.720\nThey take care of all of that.\n\n413\n00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.070\nAnd they just charge\nyou a per-mailbox fee.\n\n414\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.960\nAnd you log into the website,\nyou access your email, and\n\n415\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.150\nyou don't even have to worry about\nhow many hard drives you have or\n\n416\n00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.830\nwhether you have air-conditioning units.\n\n417\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.870\nWhether the servers are being backed up,\nwhether there's a UPS attached,\n\n418\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.610\nyou don't have to worry about any of that.\n\n419\n00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.230\nMicrosoft takes care of it for you.\n\n420\n00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.870\nAnd you don't have to worry about\nhow to get Exchange installed or\n\n421\n00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.470\nhow to troubleshoot it.\n\n422\n00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.710\nMicrosoft has their staff of who\nare arguably are the best Exchange\n\n423\n00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.480\nadministrators on the planet because\nthey're the ones who write the software.\n\n424\n00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.230\nThey're the ones who support it.\n\n425\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.250\nIf you're a small business,\nI encourage you to do this.\n\n426\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.494\nIt's not worth it to try and\nmaintain your own Exchange environment.\n\n427\n00:19:14.494 --> 00:19:17.210\nIt becomes pretty challenging, right?\n\n428\n00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:21.350\nBut, if you've got sensitive data,\nprivate data, data that you\n\n429\n00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:25.420\ncan't allow somebody else to host,\nyou don't want to host that on Microsoft.\n\n430\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.480\nYou wanna make sure you run it yourself,\n\n431\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.950\nthat way you have complete\ncontrol of those servers.\n\n432\n00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.190\nYou know where your data is at all times,\nright.\n\n433\n00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.430\nThat's important.\n\n434\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.670\nBut, it is an option.\n\n435\n00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.480\nYou'll see it's $4 per user,\nper month for a standard license.\n\n436\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.230\nNow that is standard.\n\n437\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.920\nSee how they've got compare plans?\n\n438\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.950\nAnd you can go into the plans and\nstart to look at what's available.\n\n439\n00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.900\nAnd you'll see $4 versus $8.\n\n440\n00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.090\nWhy twice as much for the online plan 2?\n\n441\n00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.260\nThat's the Enterprise CAL, right?\n\n442\n00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.043\nThese are users that have a standard and\nan Enterprise CAL, and so\n\n443\n00:19:53.043 --> 00:19:56.295\nas you start to scroll down, we'll\npass on chatting with Microsoft today.\n\n444\n00:19:56.295 --> 00:20:00.074\nBut as I scroll down, I'll see\nthe differences here in place hold,\n\n445\n00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:05.160\nunlimited storage, hosted voicemail,\ndata loss protection or prevention.\n\n446\n00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.930\nThose are the Enterprise CAL features,\nright?\n\n447\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.240\nData loss prevention,\nI didn't talk about that one.\n\n448\n00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.790\nThis is not like backups.\n\n449\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:16.960\nThis is data retention for\nregulatory compliance, I did mention that.\n\n450\n00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.530\nI just didn't call it DLP.\n\n451\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.630\nSo if I need to retain email for\nseven years, DLP will let me do that.\n\n452\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.431\nEven if the user completely deletes it,\nempties the recycle bin,\n\n453\n00:20:25.431 --> 00:20:26.790\nthey think it's gone?\n\n454\n00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.000\nDLP still saves that copy so\nI've got it, right.\n\n455\n00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.592\nSo I maintained my compliance.\n\n456\n00:20:30.592 --> 00:20:34.380\nSo this is a great option for\nsmall businesses if you've got,\n\n457\n00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.310\nlet's say you have ten mailboxes.\n\n458\n00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.152\nYou can pay Microsoft $40 a month.\n\n459\n00:20:38.152 --> 00:20:40.364\nYour ten mailboxes get hosted right there,\n\n460\n00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:44.390\nyou get a full world-class Exchange\nserver environment, for $40 a month.\n\n461\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.210\nThat's a great solution, and that's what I\nalways encourage small businesses to do.\n\n462\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.950\nBut if you're a medium or\nlarge business, there is an economy of\n\n463\n00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.559\nscale here where you might be\nable to do it cheaper yourself.\n\n464\n00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:55.599\nBut at a minimum, you get more control,\n\n465\n00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:58.188\nif you wanna control all\nthe aspects of the system.\n\n466\n00:20:58.188 --> 00:20:59.950\nHere you don't, right?\n\n467\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.070\nYour mailboxes are being hosted\non servers with other customers.\n\n468\n00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.660\nYou don't see it, it's all hidden\nfrom you, but that's the truth of it.\n\n469\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.581\nBehind the scene, you're being hosted\non servers with other customers, and\n\n470\n00:21:08.581 --> 00:21:10.510\nyou don't know who those customers are.\n\n471\n00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.250\nAnd so there's a risk that you\ntake when you use a Cloud service.\n\n472\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.240\nFor most people that's fine,\nit's an acceptable risk.\n\n473\n00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.970\nWe do it with ITPro TV, ours is hosted\nthrough Microsoft, and it works great.\n\n474\n00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.490\nBut you can host your own, too.\n\n475\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.950\nSo that's another decision.\n\n476\n00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.130\nThey call that a make or buy analysis.\n\n477\n00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.640\nYour project managers, your CIO,\n\n478\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.940\nthey'll know what that is,\nwhere do I make the solution myself?\n\n479\n00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.340\nBuild my own Exchange servers up,\nor do I buy?\n\n480\n00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.442\nDo I just let somebody else do it for me?\n\n481\n00:21:34.442 --> 00:21:36.954\nAnd doing this online,\nit works out really well.\n\n482\n00:21:36.954 --> 00:21:42.134\nI'm showing you here Exchange online,\nbut there's also Office 365, which\n\n483\n00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:48.260\npackages Exchange, but also gives you full\nOffice Suite and SharePoint connectivity.\n\n484\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.290\nThat's a neat new feature in Exchange 2013\nis you got a really good tight integration\n\n485\n00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.420\nwith SharePoint.\n\n486\n00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.420\nYou know, let me talk about\nthat real quick for a second.\n\n487\n00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.150\nLet me see if I can pull this page up.\n\n488\n00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.225\nIf you're looking at going into Exchange\nis another decision you have to make,\n\n489\n00:22:01.225 --> 00:22:04.280\nwhich is,\ndo I want to go with Exchange 2013?\n\n490\n00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.050\nExchange 2010 is still supported and\nit's more popular, right?\n\n491\n00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.090\nExchange 2013's only been out a few years.\n\n492\n00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.380\nIt's not as widely deployed as 2010.\n\n493\n00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.870\nMaybe I wanna go ahead and\ndeploy 2010 instead, right?\n\n494\n00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.830\nWhy would I jump straight to 2013?\n\n495\n00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.540\nWell, [LAUGH] I'll give you\nthe best argument right there.\n\n496\n00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.440\nThe best reason to jump to 2013 is so\n\n497\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.910\nthat you don't have to upgrade\nto 2013 later on, right?\n\n498\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.570\nIf you're doing a brand\nnew Exchange install,\n\n499\n00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.670\nalways start with\nthe latest one if you can.\n\n500\n00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.481\nBecause otherwise, two years from now,\nyou're gonna have to do an upgrade, and\n\n501\n00:22:34.481 --> 00:22:37.650\nit's gonna be costly,\ntime-consuming, and risky, right?\n\n502\n00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.270\nAny time you do an upgrade,\nthere's a risk something could go wrong.\n\n503\n00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.110\nBest to avoid that if you can, right?\n\n504\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.930\nSo always deploy the latest one.\n\n505\n00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.590\nBut if your environment's\nalready running Exchange 2010,\n\n506\n00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.290\nyou can stay on Exchange 2010.\n\n507\n00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.380\nMicrosoft still supports it.\n\n508\n00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.600\nI know you're thinking 2010,\nthat's five years old.\n\n509\n00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.470\nWell, it is.\n\n510\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.170\nBut Microsoft has wide support for it.\n\n511\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.010\nThey're really good about\nsupporting that for a long time.\n\n512\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.280\nWe'll probably see Exchange\n2010 supported well into 2017.\n\n513\n00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.080\nIt'll probably go for a while.\n\n514\n00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.430\nBut Microsoft has this nice little chart\nwhere they kinda show you what you would\n\n515\n00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.740\nlose if you were to go with one of\nthe older versions of Exchange.\n\n516\n00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.950\nSo for example, you'll see things\nlike administration has changed.\n\n517\n00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.540\nIn previous versions of Exchange,\n\n518\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.510\nwe managed it by using\nthe Enterprise Management Console.\n\n519\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.800\nAnd that Console was an MMC.\n\n520\n00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.160\nIt was software that ran right on\nyour client, and it was a pain.\n\n521\n00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.540\nIt was really slow.\n\n522\n00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.220\nAnd if you were on a new computer,\nyou had to install it.\n\n523\n00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.178\nIn Exchange 2013,\nwe have a web management interface.\n\n524\n00:23:31.178 --> 00:23:32.440\nYou just browse this webpage and\nyou manage it.\n\n525\n00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.670\nYou don't need to install anything on your\nclient and that makes life a lot easier.\n\n526\n00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.295\nThat's something you\ngain by going to 2013.\n\n527\n00:23:38.295 --> 00:23:42.051\nSome of the other things that you gain,\nwell, you'll notice like over at 2010,\n\n528\n00:23:42.051 --> 00:23:44.503\nthere's a lot of these\nfeatures 2010 already has,\n\n529\n00:23:44.503 --> 00:23:47.950\nlike role-based administration,\nCloud integration if you want.\n\n530\n00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.190\nYou don't necessarily have to go\nwith that, managed availability.\n\n531\n00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.880\nBut we'll start to see some of the bigger\ndifferences down here with the new\n\n532\n00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.370\nthings that have been introduced,\nlike support for Apps.\n\n533\n00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.989\nThird party applications are allowed to\nintegrate with the Outlook web app at\n\n534\n00:24:00.989 --> 00:24:01.552\n2013.\n\n535\n00:24:01.552 --> 00:24:03.340\nThey weren't able to do that in 2010.\n\n536\n00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.980\nAnd that means third party companies\nare writing some really cool integrations.\n\n537\n00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:12.630\nI saw some Salesforce.com demos,\nand even Microsoft CRM demos,\n\n538\n00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:16.720\nwhere you'd go into Outlook and\na phone call would come in.\n\n539\n00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.710\nYou're in OWA, and the contact record for\nthat person calling in would pop up and\n\n540\n00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.180\nyou'd see their information so\nyou'd know who it was that was calling and\n\n541\n00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.300\nhave all that data.\n\n542\n00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.850\nIt's great for salespeople, right?\n\n543\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.350\nThat kind of functionality is stuff\nthat you gain by going with 2013.\n\n544\n00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.640\nOther things, SharePoint Integration,\nI mentioned that one right,\n\n545\n00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.370\nreally tight\nSharePoint Integration with 2013.\n\n546\n00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:39.988\nDLP, that data loss prevention,\nwhich is the enhanced records management.\n\n547\n00:24:39.988 --> 00:24:43.866\nBeing able to keep that data and maintain\nour compliance, that's new in 2013.\n\n548\n00:24:43.866 --> 00:24:46.819\nAnd you'll see a few other things\nthat have just been improved,\n\n549\n00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:50.440\nlike improved E-Discovery,\nwhere we can search for mailboxes.\n\n550\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.700\nThese are all newer things in 2013 that,\nif you want those features,\n\n551\n00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.900\nyou want to jump to 2013.\n\n552\n00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.820\nThat's the one that you want.\n\n553\n00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:57.444\nAll right.\n\n554\n00:24:57.444 --> 00:25:01.490\nBut just all that aside,\njust from my own personal experience,\n\n555\n00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.750\nyou usually don't want to deploy an older\nversion of Exchange if you can avoid it.\n\n556\n00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.100\nIf you can always go with the newest one,\nyou want to go with the newest one,\n\n557\n00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.140\nbecause that'll save you\nan upgrade down the road.\n\n558\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.450\nI've done literally hundreds\nof Exchange upgrades.\n\n559\n00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:16.317\nAnd I'll tell you, if I could have avoided\nthem, I would have, every one of them.\n\n560\n00:25:16.317 --> 00:25:17.940\nSo [LAUGH] that's kinda how it is.\n\n561\n00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.910\nAnd newer upgrades aren't as painful\nas the old ones used to be, but\n\n562\n00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.980\nit's still something you'd\nrather avoid if you can.\n\n563\n00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.620\nWell, I think I've kind of gone\non long enough on this one,\n\n564\n00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.610\nbut in this episode we got\na chance to see what Exchange is.\n\n565\n00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.930\nWe talked about the licensing as far as\nStandard versus Enterprise licensing.\n\n566\n00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.036\nWe talked about the client access\nlicensing as far as the Standard and\n\n567\n00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:39.430\nthe Enterprise CAL there.\n\n568\n00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.940\nWe took a look at the online\noffering from Microsoft,\n\n569\n00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.350\nif we wanna do a hosted\nExchange environment.\n\n570\n00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.710\nAnd lastly, we just talked about\nthe different versions of Exchange and\n\n571\n00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.140\nwhich one we wanna go with.\n\n572\n00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.110\nSo, hope that opens up your eyes there\nas far as where we're going on that.\n\n573\n00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.440\nWe're a little light on the technical\ndetails this episode though, aren't we?\n\n574\n00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.614\nSo I'm really looking forward to our next\ncouple of episodes where we dive into our\n\n575\n00:25:58.614 --> 00:26:01.651\nExchange architecture, our framework,\nand then we start to get our Exchange\n\n576\n00:26:01.651 --> 00:26:03.460\nenvironment installed and\nbuild from there.\n\n577\n00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.300\nSo definitely stay tuned for that.\n\n578\n00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.740\nBut, for this episode,\nthat's a good place to wrap it up.\n\n579\n00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.240\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n580\n00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.351\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pizet.\n\n581\n00:26:11.351 --> 00:26:12.984\nAnd I'll see you next time.\n\n582\n00:26:12.984 -->

00:00:15.175\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:18.812\nI'm your host Don Pezet back\nagain with another episode of\n\n5\n00:00:18.812 --> 00:00:20.850\nMicrosoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.860\nIn this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at the Exchange Server roles that\n\n7\n00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.300\nwe can deploy Exchange in.\n\n8\n00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.490\nWhen you install Exchange there's actually\na number of different pieces inside of it.\n\n9\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.985\nAnd if you're a small business you can\njust install it all on the same server,\n\n10\n00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:36.785\njust have all the roles\nright there in one place.\n\n11\n00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:39.600\nYou have one big super Exchange Server,\nthat works fine.\n\n12\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.050\nAnd for small businesses\nthat's the recommendation.\n\n13\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.530\nBut for medium and large business,\nas you start growing,\n\n14\n00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.540\nwhen you have several thousand or\ntens of thousands of mailboxes,\n\n15\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.800\nthere's no single server that's\ngonna be able to hold up to that.\n\n16\n00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.210\nNot to mention just the fact that\nthere's a single point of failure.\n\n17\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.460\nWhat if that single server fails?\n\n18\n00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.920\nNow you're out of luck.\n\n19\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.030\nSo if we want redundancy, if we want\nscale, if we wanna be able to grow to\n\n20\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.610\nsupport our user base, we're gonna\nhave to deploy more than one server.\n\n21\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.640\nAnd when you deploy more than one server,\nyou're breaking up the pieces of Exchange\n\n22\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.330\nand spreading them out across\nmultiple pieces of hardware.\n\n23\n00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.700\nSo we need to understand\nwhat those pieces are.\n\n24\n00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.470\nNow for those of you that are taking\nthe exam, they expect you to know the new\n\n25\n00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.880\nroles in Exchange 2013 as well as\nthe previous ones from 2010 and earlier.\n\n26\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.400\nSo I'm gonna cover both of them.\n\n27\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.190\nBut even for those of you that aren't\ntaking the exam, it's good data to have\n\n28\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.250\nbecause if you have an existing Exchange\nenvironment and you're upgrading,\n\n29\n00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.360\nyou need to know what happens to those\nroles, how you build around that.\n\n30\n00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.350\nOr you'll find a lot of technical\ndata out there on the Internet,\n\n31\n00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.060\nif you start Googling for help, where\npeople are referring to the old roles.\n\n32\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.980\nAnd so we need to make sure we\nunderstand those different pieces,\n\n33\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.150\nwhat each piece does.\n\n34\n00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.740\nSo let's start with the old way and\nthen we'll move to the new way.\n\n35\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.185\nIn Exchange 2010 there were actually\nfive different roles inside of\n\n36\n00:01:56.185 --> 00:01:59.150\nMicrosoft Exchange, and each one was\nresponsible for a different piece.\n\n37\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.520\nSo let me kind of show you how these work.\n\n38\n00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.580\nI've got a little diagram that I\nwhipped up here to show kinda just\n\n39\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.860\na generic company and\nwhat they would expect to see.\n\n40\n00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.915\nNow we've got the Internet,\n\n41\n00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:11.850\nthat's the real world that's out there\nthat everybody uses and connects to.\n\n42\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.490\nBut then in our company, we probably\nhave two networks, like a DMZ and a LAN.\n\n43\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.070\nThe LAN, that's our local area network.\n\n44\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.170\nThat's our private network that\nwe don't want anybody to touch.\n\n45\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.250\nOur DMZ, that stands for demilitarized\nzone, that's our network that's public.\n\n46\n00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.870\nThat's where our web servers go,\n\n47\n00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.580\nwhere we want the Internet\nto be able to connect to it.\n\n48\n00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.010\nIf somebody on the Internet\nis gonna send us email,\n\n49\n00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.360\nit's gotta get into our company somehow.\n\n50\n00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.900\nSo we could have them come straight\ninto the LAN, but that's pretty risky.\n\n51\n00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.440\nSo it's better off to have\nthem come through a DMZ.\n\n52\n00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.670\nAnd then from the DMZ,\nit then passes in through the LAN.\n\n53\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.360\nNow in Microsoft Exchange, we can\nset it up to be able to handle that,\n\n54\n00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.760\nthanks to a couple of different roles.\n\n55\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.960\nThe first role I want to talk about,\nthough, is the most important one.\n\n56\n00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.830\nIt's this guy way over here.\n\n57\n00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.690\nThat's the Mailbox server.\n\n58\n00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.800\nThe Mailbox server is the server\nresponsible for, well, mailboxes.\n\n59\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.760\nThis is where our\nmailboxes are gonna reside.\n\n60\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.030\nIt's really a very fancy\nMicrosoft SQL database server.\n\n61\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.190\nMicrosoft's Exchange,\nat the end of the day, is storing your\n\n62\n00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.830\nemail in a database that's very similar to\nthe database that's used in Microsoft SQL.\n\n63\n00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.940\nBut it's very highly tuned and very highly\ncustomized to work as an email server.\n\n64\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.900\nSo it's not SQL,\n\n65\n00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.000\nyou can't put your own data in there\nlike that, it is just an email database.\n\n66\n00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.840\nAnd it's been changed quite\na bit to make it different\n\n67\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.220\nfrom your other database\nsolutions that are out there.\n\n68\n00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.720\nSo that Mailbox server, that's one\nthat's gonna need a lot of storage.\n\n69\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.910\nThat's where your email is.\n\n70\n00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.730\nSo if you've got millions of emails,\nthey've gotta be stored somewhere.\n\n71\n00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.220\nThe Mailbox server acts as that database.\n\n72\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.910\nNow your end users,\n\n73\n00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.370\nwhen they wanna access the Mailbox server,\nthey're not gonna connect directly to it.\n\n74\n00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.050\nWell, there are some\nscenarios where they do, but\n\n75\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.090\nmost of the time they're not\ngonna connect directly to it.\n\n76\n00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.210\nThey're gonna do something\nlike using Outlook web app and\n\n77\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.060\nbrowse to a web page to log in.\n\n78\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.900\nOr they'll fire up a POP3 or\nIMAP4 client to connect in.\n\n79\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.840\nAnd when they connect in through those\nways, well, we can have that on the same\n\n80\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.290\nphysical server or we can break it off\ninto what's called a Client Access server.\n\n81\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.840\nThe Client Access server is that\npoint of contact for your end users.\n\n82\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.890\nWhen your end users want\nto access their email,\n\n83\n00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.720\nthey access the Client Access server.\n\n84\n00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.900\nIt in turn accesses the Mailbox server.\n\n85\n00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.960\nWe may also have\na Unified Messaging server.\n\n86\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.300\nIf we've got Exchange tied into our voice\nover IP system to handle voicemail,\n\n87\n00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.640\nscheduling conferences, doing quick\ncontact dials, things like that, well,\n\n88\n00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.010\nwe can deploy a Unified Messaging server,\nand that'll tie that together too.\n\n89\n00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.070\nAnd then lastly we've got\nthe Hub Transport server.\n\n90\n00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.740\nThe Hub Transport server is the one\nresponsible for moving email around.\n\n91\n00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.250\nIt's the one that runs SMTP,\nthe simple mail transport protocol.\n\n92\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.417\nSo all incoming and outgoing email in\nyour organization is gonna pass through\n\n93\n00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:57.900\nthe Hub Transport server.\n\n94\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.290\nIt's gonna move right through there.\n\n95\n00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.850\nSo it's a great place to deploy\nthings like spam and virus filtering,\n\n96\n00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.600\nemail policy rules, things that add legal\ndisclaimers at the bottom of emails.\n\n97\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.730\nYou can deploy them there cuz all\nof your email is gonna pass through\n\n98\n00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.360\nthat Hub Transport server.\n\n99\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.660\nSo that's its role.\n\n100\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.190\nNow I could have one physical server\nthat's running all four of these roles,\n\n101\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.430\nand in a small business that works fine.\n\n102\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.420\nYou can deploy them all right there.\n\n103\n00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.850\nOr I could have four servers\nthat are running these, or\n\n104\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.320\nI could have ten servers.\n\n105\n00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.550\nI might have three\nClient Access servers and\n\n106\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.220\ntwo Mailbox servers, one\nUnified Messaging and two Hub Transport.\n\n107\n00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.230\nYou can mix it up.\n\n108\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.110\nI'm not sure that adds up to ten,\nI wasn't keeping track.\n\n109\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.735\nSo maybe I went over ten, I don't know.\n\n110\n00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:41.300\n[LAUGH] But you can have multiple\nservers based on your need.\n\n111\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.720\nAnd your need might be for\nredundancy as far as failure.\n\n112\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.902\nIt might just be for scale.\n\n113\n00:05:44.902 --> 00:05:48.973\nYou've got so many users that one Client\nAccess server can't do it, so you deploy\n\n114\n00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:52.470\nthree or five or fifty to support\nthe amount of users that you've got.\n\n115\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.040\nThis is a very modular deployment that\ngives you that ability to expand.\n\n116\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.072\nNow what, oh, sorry, I left out one role.\n\n117\n00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:02.558\nThere's this one guy\nsitting way over here.\n\n118\n00:06:02.558 --> 00:06:04.210\nNow why did I leave him out?\n\n119\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.760\nHe's special.\n\n120\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.780\nThese other roles,\n\n121\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.380\nremember how I said you could have one\nserver that was running all four roles?\n\n122\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.630\nYou can, but there's a fifth role.\n\n123\n00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.100\nAnd that fifth role,\nthe Edge Transport server, he's different.\n\n124\n00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.900\nHe has to be by himself.\n\n125\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.960\nHe can't run on a server that's\na Mailbox server or Client Access or\n\n126\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.210\nHub Transport or Unified Messaging.\n\n127\n00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.410\nHe has to be all by himself\nout there in the DMZ.\n\n128\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.460\nAnd that's because this is the server\nthat's designed to be ultra secure,\n\n129\n00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.460\nthat's really, really protected and\nisolated from your network.\n\n130\n00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.650\nThese guys over here,\nall four of these roles,\n\n131\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.680\nhave to have direct connectivity\nto your Active Directory.\n\n132\n00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.340\nThey've got to be able to\npull up your user list.\n\n133\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.030\nThey've got be able to authenticate users.\n\n134\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.060\nThey've got to be able\nto do a lot of stuff.\n\n135\n00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.070\nWell, if somebody from the outside world\nwere to hack into one of these servers,\n\n136\n00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.550\nthey would then have access\nto your internal network,\n\n137\n00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.040\nto your domain controllers, to things that\nyou don't want them to have access to.\n\n138\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.990\nSo Microsoft created a special\nversion of Exchange.\n\n139\n00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.170\nIt's called the Edge Transport Server and\n\n140\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.100\nit doesn't need to be connected\nto the Active Directory.\n\n141\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.230\nIt can run as a standalone entity and\nif somebody hacks into it, big deal.\n\n142\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.470\nThey just have access to that server and\nthat's it.\n\n143\n00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.020\nBut it's got very,\nvery limited functionality.\n\n144\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.850\nWe're gonna cover it in\nsome later episodes so\n\n145\n00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.460\nyou get a chance to see how it works.\n\n146\n00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.695\nBut it's a great place\nto run antivirus and\n\n147\n00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:22.750\nanti-spam cuz it filters things out\nbefore they even get into your network.\n\n148\n00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.160\nNow I'll tell you, of the roles,\nthis is one of the least popular.\n\n149\n00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.820\nNot a lot of people run an Edge Transport\nserver, and you might ask yourself why,\n\n150\n00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.180\nif this makes it more secure,\nwhy wouldn't I want it?\n\n151\n00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.190\nAnd the reason is a lot of people already\nhave something that provides this role.\n\n152\n00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:42.580\nSo for example, us, for ITProTV, we have\na Barracuda anti-spam and virus firewall.\n\n153\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.480\nIt's an appliance, and it does exactly\nwhat that Edge Transport server does.\n\n154\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.650\nIt sits in our DMZ, email flows into it,\ngets filtered before it even comes in, and\n\n155\n00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.420\nthen the Barracuda is allowed\nto talk to our internal systems.\n\n156\n00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.870\nIt performs this role,\nthe role of an Edge Transport server.\n\n157\n00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.238\nYou don't have to use\nMicrosoft's Edge Transport.\n\n158\n00:07:59.238 --> 00:08:01.780\nYou can use any provider\nout there that you want.\n\n159\n00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.753\nBut if you don't have one,\nyou can use Microsoft's.\n\n160\n00:08:04.753 --> 00:08:08.436\nAnd now it's supported by the same people\nthat are running your operating system as\n\n161\n00:08:08.436 --> 00:08:12.310\nwell as your internal mail servers, so\nit creates a more consistent environment.\n\n162\n00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.620\nSo it's up to you whether you\nwanna go that route or not, but\n\n163\n00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.350\nit is purely optional.\n\n164\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.890\nSome of these roles are optional, right.\n\n165\n00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.560\nThe Unified Messaging, if you don't have a\nVoice over IP system that you want to tie\n\n166\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.780\ninto, you don't need this role,\nyou leave it out, you just chuck it and\n\n167\n00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.835\nthat's the end of it.\n\n168\n00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:26.490\nRight?\n\n169\n00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.860\nBut these three roles,\nHub Transport, Client Access, and\n\n170\n00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.264\nMailbox, you have to have\nthose in Exchange 2010.\n\n171\n00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.510\nNow, when email comes\ninto your organization,\n\n172\n00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.850\nif you have all the roles,\nit looks something like this.\n\n173\n00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.040\nYou mail comes into\nthe Edge Transport Server,\n\n174\n00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.390\nit then jumps over to\na Hub Transport Server.\n\n175\n00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.490\nSo bridging that gap between the DMZ and\nthe Hub.\n\n176\n00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.710\nNow, neat thing about this,\nI shouldn't have drawn arrow this way.\n\n177\n00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.390\nThis arrow really should be pointing\nthe other direction because\n\n178\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:00.590\nthe Edge Transport Server is not allowed\nto talk to your Local Area Network.\n\n179\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.670\nIt's not.\nIt cannot talk to your LAN.\n\n180\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:08.488\nInstead, your Hub Transport Server has to\nreach out to it and pull the email back.\n\n181\n00:09:08.488 --> 00:09:12.180\nAnd that way, if somebody hacks into this\nbox, they can't initiate connections in.\n\n182\n00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.790\nThe connections have to be\ninitiated from the inside out.\n\n183\n00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.350\nIt makes them more secure.\n\n184\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.740\nSo your email comes into the Edge\nTransport, your Hub Transport Server goes\n\n185\n00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.110\nand picks it up, and now it gets it and\nsends it to the Mailbox Server.\n\n186\n00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.240\nYour end users connect to\nthe Client Access Server and\n\n187\n00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.920\nthe Client Access Server\nconnects the Mailbox Server.\n\n188\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.500\nAnd that's how they get their email.\n\n189\n00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.170\nOr your voice over IP system\nconnects that Mailbox Server\n\n190\n00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.950\nthrough the Unified Messaging Server.\n\n191\n00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.910\nAll these pieces kind of integrate\ntogether, and if these four are all\n\n192\n00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.950\nrunning on the same hardware,\nthat's all just happening in software.\n\n193\n00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.800\nBut, if these are running on\nseparate physical servers,\n\n194\n00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.770\nthey just communicate via the network, and\nit's nothing too terribly special, right?\n\n195\n00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.660\nWe can build redundancy into this\nby adding multiple servers, and\n\n196\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.430\nyou get a really powerful\nexchange environment built up.\n\n197\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.310\nHowever, Microsoft did some studies, and\nthey found some really interesting things.\n\n198\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:02.640\nThey found, for example, that very\nfew people used Unified Messaging.\n\n199\n00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.070\nAnd that when they did, the functions\nthat Unified Messaging Server\n\n200\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.680\nrole was providing, were actually\nbeing performed by their other system.\n\n201\n00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.910\nSo, like if you have\na Cisco Unified Communication Server,\n\n202\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.330\nit does the bulk of what\nthe Unified Messaging Server role did.\n\n203\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.130\nSo at the end of the day,\nthe Unified Messaging Server was\n\n204\n00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.310\nreally just acting like a proxy at that\npoint, the Cisco stuff did all the work.\n\n205\n00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.040\nOr you might have a Via or\nMicrocom, Microtel,\n\n206\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.660\none of those guys, and\ntheir systems do a lot of that work and\n\n207\n00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.510\nwe don't necessarily need\nthe Unified Messaging Server to do it.\n\n208\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.470\nAll right.\n\n209\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.720\nSo, Microsoft found that was\nthe case in a lot of environments.\n\n210\n00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.790\nThis same thing went for\nthe Edge Transport Server.\n\n211\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.840\nA lot of people weren't using it.\n\n212\n00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.410\nThey had a third party system that was\ndoing it and they were sticking with that.\n\n213\n00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.870\nThey also found that most people\nwere deploying Hub Transport Servers\n\n214\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.430\nincorrectly.\n\n215\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.021\nThey were using them the wrong way and\n\n216\n00:10:50.021 --> 00:10:52.800\ndeploying them in a way\nthat wasn't secure.\n\n217\n00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.920\nAnd so in Exchange 2013, Microsoft said,\n\n218\n00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.270\nyou know what,\nwe really need to revisit this.\n\n219\n00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.370\nWe need to tweak things to be a little\nmore efficient, to be a little more\n\n220\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.890\nintuitive, and to make sense with\nthe way people are using our products.\n\n221\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:10.340\nSo in Exchange 2010, we had five roles,\nin Exchange 2013, we only have three.\n\n222\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.260\nThere's just three roles and\nthat's it, alright.\n\n223\n00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.040\nSo in Exchange 2013,\nthe Unified Messaging role is gone, and\n\n224\n00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.160\nthe Hub Transport role is gone.\n\n225\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.386\nNow if you rely on those, which the Hub\nTransport you definitely do, dont panic.\n\n226\n00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:25.640\nIt's not that they're gone as in\nthe functionality is all gone,\n\n227\n00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.590\nits just that they've been\neliminated as roles and\n\n228\n00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.350\nnow Microsoft dictates how they\nwork inside of the system.\n\n229\n00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.040\nThey work in a much more intuitive manner.\n\n230\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.210\nSo let's talk about how this works.\n\n231\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.410\nFirst off,\nif you install Exchange 2013 from DVD,\n\n232\n00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:43.730\nyou only have two roles,\nClient Access and Mailbox.\n\n233\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.410\nAnd that's it, right?\n\n234\n00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.140\nEdge Transport, Microsoft left it out.\n\n235\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.250\nMicrosoft said, you know a lot of people\nare using third party stuff, well,\n\n236\n00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.160\nwe'll just let them stick with\ntheir third-party stuff and\n\n237\n00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.240\nwe'll eliminate the Edge Transport role.\n\n238\n00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.230\nSo they eliminated it,\noriginally in 2013, and there was so\n\n239\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.990\nmuch feedback from the community,\npeople saying, no we really want that.\n\n240\n00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.890\nYeah, yeah,\nwe're running a third-party system but\n\n241\n00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.890\nwe wanna migrate to the Edge Transport\nrole, we just haven't done it yet.\n\n242\n00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.370\nAnd so in Exchange 2013 Service Pack 1,\n\n243\n00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:12.210\nMicrosoft reintroduced the Edge Transport\nrole, so that's back again.\n\n244\n00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.790\nBe careful with that if you're\nGoogling for help on the Internet,\n\n245\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.780\nyou'll see a lot of people say there's\nonly two roles in Exchange 2013.\n\n246\n00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.100\nBut on the exam,\nthe exam is based on Service Pack 1,\n\n247\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.870\nthere's three roles in Exchange 2013,\nso be aware of that, right?\n\n248\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.680\nNow you may not use it.\n\n249\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.230\nYou can always just choose not\nto use the Edge Transport role.\n\n250\n00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.710\nBut at a minimum you're gonna have these\ntwo guys, Client Access Server and\n\n251\n00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.630\nMailbox Server.\n\n252\n00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.330\nYou've got to have them, right.\n\n253\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.710\nThe Mailbox Server is\nwhere your email resides.\n\n254\n00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:37.685\nIt's gotta be stored somewhere.\n\n255\n00:12:37.685 --> 00:12:38.455\nYou have to have that.\n\n256\n00:12:38.455 --> 00:12:41.125\nAnd the Client Access Server,\nthat's what your clients connect to.\n\n257\n00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:42.845\nThey've gotta have a way\nto get to the email.\n\n258\n00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:43.795\nYou have to have that.\n\n259\n00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:45.685\nThose are the two roles you have to have.\n\n260\n00:12:45.685 --> 00:12:48.625\nYou could deploy them on\nthe same physical server.\n\n261\n00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:49.515\nIt'll let you do that.\n\n262\n00:12:49.515 --> 00:12:50.135\nRight.\n\n263\n00:12:50.135 --> 00:12:52.105\nOr you could split them\nup into two servers.\n\n264\n00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.225\nYou could have 20 servers.\n\n265\n00:12:53.225 --> 00:12:54.575\nYou could have more than one of each role.\n\n266\n00:12:54.575 --> 00:12:55.680\nThat works great.\n\n267\n00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.370\nAll right.\n\n268\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.650\nSo when email comes in,\nit comes into the Edge Transport role,\n\n269\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.550\nthe Edge Transport sends it to\nthe Client Access Server, now.\n\n270\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.550\nAnd the Client Access Server\ndistributes it to the Mailbox Server.\n\n271\n00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.340\nMail flows a little bit different\nbecause we don't have that Hub Transport\n\n272\n00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.280\nrole anymore.\n\n273\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:11.800\nAll right?\n\n274\n00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.890\nAnd we don't have\nthe Unified Messaging role.\n\n275\n00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.580\nWell, what happened to those guys?\n\n276\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.930\nWhat happened to\nthe Unified Messaging role?\n\n277\n00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:22.330\nWell, because most people\nwere using it as a proxy,\n\n278\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.810\nbasically, Microsoft did exactly that.\n\n279\n00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:29.580\nThey reduced it to become more of just\na proxy and it runs as just a service now.\n\n280\n00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.710\nIt's not a role,\nit's not something we have to install.\n\n281\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.270\nIt's a service that's installed\nautomatically on your Mailbox Server.\n\n282\n00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.350\nSo your Mailbox Server is\nactually running that proxy.\n\n283\n00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.810\nAnd if you have a third party voice over\nIP system that supports Exchange 2013,\n\n284\n00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.990\nyou can point it right to there.\n\n285\n00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.050\nAll right.\n\n286\n00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.650\nIf you don't have a third\nparty voice over IP system and\n\n287\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.340\nyou want one, well, what about all\nthe functionality that's gone?\n\n288\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.020\nWell that's now part of Microsoft's\nlink or Skype for Business.\n\n289\n00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.570\nSo it's all been kind of rolled into that\nnew system and you can deploy that and\n\n290\n00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:58.338\nit takes care of it.\n\n291\n00:13:58.338 --> 00:13:59.660\nSo they just kind of shifted that out and\n\n292\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.540\nthey said not enough people are using\nit to keep it as part of Exchange.\n\n293\n00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.890\nNow it's a separate product.\n\n294\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.290\nOn the Hub Transport side,\nwell, that one is still there.\n\n295\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.880\nThe Hub Transport role is\ntechnically still there.\n\n296\n00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.850\nBut what happened is,\nthey broke it into three services.\n\n297\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.875\nInstead of being a dedicated role that you\ncan install on a dedicated server, if you\n\n298\n00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:24.305\nwanted, now it's three services that work\ntogether that are already implemented.\n\n299\n00:14:24.305 --> 00:14:26.885\nAnd this gives us the most\nefficient implementation and\n\n300\n00:14:26.885 --> 00:14:30.435\nthe most reliable one and it insures that\nit's always being deployed correctly, so\n\n301\n00:14:30.435 --> 00:14:32.650\nwe don't have to worry about the role\nanymore it's basically gone.\n\n302\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.380\nAll right.\n\n303\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.530\nNow the three services.\n\n304\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.270\nLet me just kind of run over those and\nhow they work.\n\n305\n00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.430\nThe first one is kind of important.\n\n306\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.445\nIt's called\nthe Front-end Transport service.\n\n307\n00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:44.370\nThe Front-end Transport service?\n\n308\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.990\nThat's basically our SMTP server.\n\n309\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.160\nRight.\nThis is where our incoming mail is gonna\n\n310\n00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.780\ncome in to and\nwhere our outgoing mail goes out to.\n\n311\n00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.320\nSo, when email comes in and goes to an\nEdge Transport Server, if we have one, or\n\n312\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.460\njust comes in bypassing it, if we don't,\nit's gonna come to a Client Access Server.\n\n313\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.410\nAnd it's the Front-end Transport\nservice that's running right\n\n314\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.100\nhere on the Client Access Server,\nthat's what's gonna receive that email.\n\n315\n00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.390\nNow, interesting fact here.\n\n316\n00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.102\nIt receives the email but\nit does not queue it.\n\n317\n00:15:11.102 --> 00:15:15.520\nThe Front-end Transport service does not\nhold your email, not even for a second.\n\n318\n00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.030\nIt doesn't write it to the hard drive.\n\n319\n00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.530\nIt receives it in RAM,\napplies any transport rules that it has.\n\n320\n00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.710\nWe might do email, spam and\nvirus filtering or\n\n321\n00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.590\ncompliance journaling, whatever it is.\n\n322\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.810\nIt does that and\nthen it sends the email on,\n\n323\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.550\nto be able to go back\nto that Mailbox Server.\n\n324\n00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.750\nNow back in the Mailbox Server we actually\nhave two services that are running there.\n\n325\n00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.630\nThat was the Front-end Transport service.\n\n326\n00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.720\nThen we've got our Hub Transport service.\n\n327\n00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.290\nNow that sounds familiar, right?\n\n328\n00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.240\nThe Hub Transport role,\nhere's the Hub Transport service.\n\n329\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.090\nThe Hub Transport service is what\nmanages your queues, your incoming and\n\n330\n00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.116\noutgoing mail queue.\n\n331\n00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:53.916\nWhen an e-mail comes in, it actually\ngets written to the hard drive and\n\n332\n00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:55.222\nit sits there on the hard drive for\n\n333\n00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:58.084\na second while it figures out where\nto send it, that's your mail queue.\n\n334\n00:15:58.084 --> 00:16:02.087\nOutgoing e-mail is the same way, it drops\ninto a queue and it sits there in that\n\n335\n00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:05.680\nfolder until we can contact\nthe destination server and send it along.\n\n336\n00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.465\nSo the hub transport service is that\nseries of cues and it's gonna store those\n\n337\n00:16:10.465 --> 00:16:14.306\nemails and it's doing that right\nhere on the mailbox server.\n\n338\n00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:18.019\nAnd then lastly, we've got our\nmailbox transport service and\n\n339\n00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.963\nthe mailbox transport\nservice is responsible for\n\n340\n00:16:20.963 --> 00:16:25.039\nmoving emails between the hub\ntransport service and the mailboxes.\n\n341\n00:16:25.039 --> 00:16:27.859\nSo those cues that are sitting here,\nthat's what's shifting in between.\n\n342\n00:16:27.859 --> 00:16:32.133\nWhen you write an email in Outlook,\nif I write an email and I hit send,\n\n343\n00:16:32.133 --> 00:16:37.315\nthe first thing it does is it copies it to\nmy outbound mailbox or my outbound folder.\n\n344\n00:16:37.315 --> 00:16:39.471\nSo you've got this outbound folder.\n\n345\n00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:42.980\nAnd then once it sends,\nthen it moves it to sent items.\n\n346\n00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.113\nWhen it's in that outbound folder, that's\nwhen it's trying to communicate that\n\n347\n00:16:46.113 --> 00:16:48.181\nmailbox transport service to\nbe able to send it along.\n\n348\n00:16:48.181 --> 00:16:51.510\nAnd once it communicates,\nthen it moves it to sent items.\n\n349\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.920\nSo I can have an email stuck in outbound,\nif it's just pending and\n\n350\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.490\ncan't communicate with the server.\n\n351\n00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.630\nSo that's it communicating\nwith this other service.\n\n352\n00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.509\nSo hub transport's been divided into three\nservices and those services have been\n\n353\n00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:07.572\nspread across the client access server, so\nwe don't have to worry about it anymore.\n\n354\n00:17:07.572 --> 00:17:09.986\nBut that's kinda gone,\nit's gone by the wayside.\n\n355\n00:17:09.986 --> 00:17:11.925\nThose are roles we don't\nhave to worry about.\n\n356\n00:17:11.925 --> 00:17:15.744\nSo at the end of the day, there's really\ntwo main roles we have to worry about.\n\n357\n00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:19.615\nClient access server and mailbox server\nand they can run in the same box or\n\n358\n00:17:19.615 --> 00:17:20.820\nwe can split them up and\n\n359\n00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.089\nrum them on separate boxes and we can run\nmore than one of each based on our scale.\n\n360\n00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.990\nAs your database gets larger,\nit takes longer to backup.\n\n361\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.387\nIt takes more memory to cache and\nindex, so\n\n362\n00:17:30.387 --> 00:17:32.925\nwe might want more than\none physical server.\n\n363\n00:17:32.925 --> 00:17:34.720\nWe can have more than one mailbox server.\n\n364\n00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.730\nWe might wanna have mailbox\nservers in multiple geographic\n\n365\n00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.060\nlocations, you can do that.\n\n366\n00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.431\nYou just have more than one.\n\n367\n00:17:39.431 --> 00:17:41.043\nSame thing with client access.\n\n368\n00:17:41.043 --> 00:17:43.284\nClient access is all about CPU and RAM.\n\n369\n00:17:43.284 --> 00:17:46.782\nIf I have so many users, that server's\ngetting overloaded and I can just add more\n\n370\n00:17:46.782 --> 00:17:49.928\nand I can load balance across them and\nwe'll see that in later episodes.\n\n371\n00:17:49.928 --> 00:17:53.063\nWe're gonna have an entire series\nof episodes that are based just on\n\n372\n00:17:53.063 --> 00:17:56.151\nthe mailbox server role and\njust on the client access server role.\n\n373\n00:17:56.151 --> 00:17:59.104\nAnd then there's that third row we don't\nwanna forget about, the edge transport.\n\n374\n00:17:59.104 --> 00:18:03.589\nIf you want that secure kind of gateway\nin between you and the internet,\n\n375\n00:18:03.589 --> 00:18:06.603\nthe edge transport role\nis designed to do that.\n\n376\n00:18:06.603 --> 00:18:11.030\nIt's a very limited version of Exchange,\nit's not allowed to talk to your LAN.\n\n377\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.464\nServers on the inside of your\nnetwork have to reach out to\n\n378\n00:18:14.464 --> 00:18:17.836\nit to pull data back in and\nso that makes it very secure.\n\n379\n00:18:17.836 --> 00:18:22.074\nAnd if somebody were the break into it,\nthey cant get to your internal network.\n\n380\n00:18:22.074 --> 00:18:24.067\nKeeps things nice and safe.\n\n381\n00:18:24.067 --> 00:18:26.378\nSo that's kind of what\nthat is designed for.\n\n382\n00:18:26.378 --> 00:18:29.847\nSo when you're getting ready to install\nExchange, if you're doing a brand new\n\n383\n00:18:29.847 --> 00:18:33.392\ndeployment for your environment, these\nare the things you have to think about.\n\n384\n00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:36.946\nDo I want one server that's gonna\nrun both client access and mailbox?\n\n385\n00:18:36.946 --> 00:18:38.512\nOr do I want to do two servers?\n\n386\n00:18:38.512 --> 00:18:39.453\nOr do I want to do five servers?\n\n387\n00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:40.068\nOr ten servers?\n\n388\n00:18:40.068 --> 00:18:41.763\nWhat's my load going to be like?\n\n389\n00:18:41.763 --> 00:18:45.115\nWell, if you go on to Microsoft's TechNet\nwebsite they have various pages on\n\n390\n00:18:45.115 --> 00:18:47.603\nthere to kind of help you to\ndo your scaling and planning.\n\n391\n00:18:47.603 --> 00:18:52.043\nBut at the end of the day,\nmy rule of thumb for your average user,\n\n392\n00:18:52.043 --> 00:18:56.170\nI try and keep mailbox servers\nto 1,500 users or less.\n\n393\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.484\nWhen you start getting over 1,500 users,\nit's just a lot of seek time on that\n\n394\n00:19:00.484 --> 00:19:03.125\ndatabase and\nmost file systems can't handle it.\n\n395\n00:19:03.125 --> 00:19:05.923\nBut you don't always have average users.\n\n396\n00:19:05.923 --> 00:19:09.037\nSometimes you have power users that\nhave 10 gig mailboxes, sometimes\n\n397\n00:19:09.037 --> 00:19:12.772\nyou have really light users that only have\n100 meg mailboxes that are really small.\n\n398\n00:19:12.772 --> 00:19:16.710\nSo that really influences how many\npeople a single server can handle.\n\n399\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.144\nAnd on client access servers,\n\n400\n00:19:18.144 --> 00:19:21.520\nit really comes down to how many\nsimultaneous users you have connected.\n\n401\n00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.051\nEach user's gonna occupy\na little bit of CPU and\n\n402\n00:19:24.051 --> 00:19:26.082\na little bit of memory on your system.\n\n403\n00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:27.592\nIf they're doing Outlook Web App,\n\n404\n00:19:27.592 --> 00:19:30.273\nthen they're actually gonna\noccupy a little bit more memory.\n\n405\n00:19:30.273 --> 00:19:33.524\nYou'll find your average users\nconsuming somewhere between 40 and\n\n406\n00:19:33.524 --> 00:19:35.021\n50K of memory on that system.\n\n407\n00:19:35.021 --> 00:19:36.633\nSo if you have thousands of users,\n\n408\n00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:39.479\nyou can start to see where that's\ngonna run out pretty fast.\n\n409\n00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:43.279\nSo TechNet has some scaling tools,\nyou can punch in your amount of users and\n\n410\n00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:47.396\nit'll help you to scale that out, but\nit's really easy to scale out on your own.\n\n411\n00:19:47.396 --> 00:19:49.394\nI usually deploy these\nas virtual machines.\n\n412\n00:19:49.394 --> 00:19:51.751\nSo if I see a client access\nserver getting overwhelmed,\n\n413\n00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:54.523\nI can just spin up another client\naccess server and go from there.\n\n414\n00:19:54.523 --> 00:19:56.611\nSo really easy to do that.\n\n415\n00:19:56.611 --> 00:20:01.250\nDo be aware that we need to make sure\nwe're running either Exchange Standard or\n\n416\n00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.673\nExchange Enterprise.\n\n417\n00:20:02.673 --> 00:20:05.418\nAnd if you remember from an earlier\nepisode, the difference there,\n\n418\n00:20:05.418 --> 00:20:08.130\nExchange Enterprise can handle up\nto a hundred mailbox databases.\n\n419\n00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.323\nExchange Standard can only handle\nup to five mailbox databases.\n\n420\n00:20:11.323 --> 00:20:15.349\nWell, if I'm running my client access and\nmailbox on the same server and\n\n421\n00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:19.853\nI've got more than five mailbox databases,\nthen I need an Enterprise edition.\n\n422\n00:20:19.853 --> 00:20:22.465\nBut if I split these off,\nmy mailbox server may or\n\n423\n00:20:22.465 --> 00:20:26.609\nmay not need Enterprise based on the\nmailbox databases, but my client access\n\n424\n00:20:26.609 --> 00:20:30.838\nserver will always be standard edition\nunless I just feel like wasting money.\n\n425\n00:20:30.838 --> 00:20:34.041\nThe client access server\ndoes not hold the email.\n\n426\n00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:35.597\nIt has no mailbox databases.\n\n427\n00:20:35.597 --> 00:20:38.918\nIt's doing Outlook Web App, POP3, IMAP4.\n\n428\n00:20:38.918 --> 00:20:41.216\nIt's doing the offline address book.\n\n429\n00:20:41.216 --> 00:20:46.313\nIt's doing the mobile device management,\ncommunicating to mobile devices.\n\n430\n00:20:46.313 --> 00:20:50.570\nIt's doing all of those functions and it's\nrunning that front-end transport service,\n\n431\n00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.036\nwhich doesn't queue emails.\n\n432\n00:20:52.036 --> 00:20:54.742\nSo literally, no email is stored\non the client access server.\n\n433\n00:20:54.742 --> 00:20:58.140\nI don't need to pay for an Enterprise\nlicense to get more mailbox databases on\n\n434\n00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.617\na server that doesn't have any.\n\n435\n00:20:59.617 --> 00:21:04.167\nSo even if I was a trillion dollar\nmultinational company that had hundreds of\n\n436\n00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:08.861\nthousands of users, I would still only\ndo Enterprise on my mailbox servers and\n\n437\n00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:10.369\nnot on my client access.\n\n438\n00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:12.819\nSo definitely be aware of\nthat as you plan for this.\n\n439\n00:21:12.819 --> 00:21:16.089\nBut you'll probably have more than one\nclient access server before the end of\n\n440\n00:21:16.089 --> 00:21:18.461\nthe day,\nyou'll probably load balance across those.\n\n441\n00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:19.281\nAnd then that way,\n\n442\n00:21:19.281 --> 00:21:22.420\nyou can quickly add new servers as you\nneed to scale your environment up.\n\n443\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.438\nThat's an important thing to do.\n\n444\n00:21:25.438 --> 00:21:26.924\nSo be aware of that.\n\n445\n00:21:26.924 --> 00:21:29.780\nOn the edge transport side,\nyou might need redundancy there also.\n\n446\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.625\nThis is how the internet\nis connecting to you.\n\n447\n00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:34.178\nIt's probably where your MX\nrecords are gonna point to,\n\n448\n00:21:34.178 --> 00:21:37.117\nyour mail exchange records, so\npeople know where to send email.\n\n449\n00:21:37.117 --> 00:21:39.799\nAnd if your one server goes down,\nyou stop receiving email.\n\n450\n00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:44.185\nSo you might need 2 of these or 3 or 20,\nyou can setup a whole array, if you want.\n\n451\n00:21:44.185 --> 00:21:46.460\n[LAUGH] Yes,\nit gets kinda crazy after a while.\n\n452\n00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.152\nBut you can deploy as many as you want and\n\n453\n00:21:48.152 --> 00:21:50.105\nthese just need to be\nstandard edition also.\n\n454\n00:21:50.105 --> 00:21:53.681\nNo sense doing enterprise,\nbecause they don't store email.\n\n455\n00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:55.504\nThey're receiving it and\nforwarding it along.\n\n456\n00:21:55.504 --> 00:21:58.263\nThere is actually a queue here\non the transport server while\n\n457\n00:21:58.263 --> 00:21:59.427\nit's scanning emails.\n\n458\n00:21:59.427 --> 00:22:04.002\nBut if we were to lose those, it's just\na small portion of time that you lose.\n\n459\n00:22:04.002 --> 00:22:06.207\nSo we don't normally worry\ntoo much about that.\n\n460\n00:22:06.207 --> 00:22:09.567\nYou don't normally backup edge transport\nservers, just because the email's so\n\n461\n00:22:09.567 --> 00:22:10.108\ntransient.\n\n462\n00:22:10.108 --> 00:22:12.245\nIt's just passing through\nwhile it gets scanned.\n\n463\n00:22:12.245 --> 00:22:16.203\nAnd if you're not scanning it,\nthen it just passes through really fast.\n\n464\n00:22:16.203 --> 00:22:19.710\nThe email's only on there for\na fraction of a second.\n\n465\n00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:24.307\nSo those are the roles inside of Exchange\n2013 that we need to be aware of.\n\n466\n00:22:24.307 --> 00:22:28.126\nI wanted to cover this in depth,\nbecause when you're installing Exchange,\n\n467\n00:22:28.126 --> 00:22:31.488\none of the first things it asks you\nis what role do you wanna install?\n\n468\n00:22:31.488 --> 00:22:35.586\nDo you want it to be client access or\ndo you want it to be a mailbox database?\n\n469\n00:22:35.586 --> 00:22:37.165\nDo you want it to be edge transport?\n\n470\n00:22:37.165 --> 00:22:38.569\nYou got to pick.\n\n471\n00:22:38.569 --> 00:22:41.263\nAnd so we need to understand those\nroles and how they fit together.\n\n472\n00:22:41.263 --> 00:22:45.985\nIn 2013, it is still the same that\nedge transport has to be by itself\n\n473\n00:22:45.985 --> 00:22:50.882\nversus client access and mailbox that\ncan be combined or can be separate.\n\n474\n00:22:50.882 --> 00:22:52.995\nWell, that's about it as far\nas what I've got on the roles.\n\n475\n00:22:52.995 --> 00:22:56.758\nSo in this episode, we got a change\nto see the Exchange 2010 roles and\n\n476\n00:22:56.758 --> 00:23:00.663\nhow they used to work and the Exchange\n2013 roles and how they work now.\n\n477\n00:23:00.663 --> 00:23:04.076\nAnd that's important stuff to know\nwhen we're doing the install.\n\n478\n00:23:04.076 --> 00:23:05.643\nWell, this is a good point\nto wrap this one up.\n\n479\n00:23:05.643 --> 00:23:07.095\nSo, I hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n480\n00:23:07.095 --> 00:23:10.578\nStay tuned, because we've got more\nExchange 2013 coming down the line.\n\n481\n00:23:10.578 --> 00:23:14.537\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll you next time.\n\n482\n00:23:14.537 -->

good evening.\n\n4\n00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.810\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.830\nI'm your host, Don Pezet Back again\nwith another episode of Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.050\nNow in this episode, we're gonna take a\nlook at preparing our Active Directory for\n\n7\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.480\nour Exchange install.\n\n8\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.150\nAnd if you've been watching out episodes,\nI think we're on episode number three now.\n\n9\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.550\nYou're probably thinking boy,\nthis is a great series Don.\n\n10\n00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.181\nBut you haven't actually\ndone any work yet.\n\n11\n00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:36.625\n[LAUGH] And so, this will be the first\nepisode we do some real work as far as\n\n12\n00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:39.230\ngetting Exchange deployed\nin our environment.\n\n13\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.530\nAnd the funny part,\nit's not even to work with Exchange.\n\n14\n00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.070\nIt's to work with the Active Directory.\n\n15\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.010\nNow why do we have to do that?\n\n16\n00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.040\nWell, Microsoft Exchange\ndoes some really neat stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.710\nOne of the cool things that it does is\nthat it stores its entire configuration\n\n18\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.300\nin the active directory, and\n\n19\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.750\nthat's pretty awesome because your\nactive directory replicates, right?\n\n20\n00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.580\nSo you've probably got\nmultiple domain controllers.\n\n21\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.290\nI say probably, I hope you have\nmultiple domain controllers.\n\n22\n00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.700\nSo that Active Directory partition is\nbeing replicated between all those\n\n23\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.980\ndifferent systems.\n\n24\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.290\nAnd that means if you lose your Exchange\nServer, you can actually restore it,\n\n25\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.080\nbring it up really quickly because\nit can reload the config right from\n\n26\n00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.110\nthe Active Directory.\n\n27\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.930\nAnd then you just have to restore your\nmailbox data and you're in business.\n\n28\n00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.230\nActive Directory restores\nare lightning fast because of that.\n\n29\n00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.980\nSo definitely, a cool thing to have.\n\n30\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.210\nAlso, all of your user data.\n\n31\n00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.120\nSo, for example, like what email\naddresses I have attached to me, or\n\n32\n00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.370\nwhat groups I'm in.\n\n33\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.610\nThat's all stored in\nthe active directory also.\n\n34\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.330\nThat makes for quick look ups and\n\n35\n00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.715\na database that's already being\nreplicated across my environment.\n\n36\n00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:41.715\nSo Exchange builds on that.\n\n37\n00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:45.495\nYou cannot deploy Microsoft Exchange\nwithout having an Active Directory first.\n\n38\n00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:47.815\nYou've gotta have\nan Active Directory to run Exchange.\n\n39\n00:01:47.815 --> 00:01:49.785\nThere is no standalone mode.\n\n40\n00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:52.305\nBut the Active Directory out of the box,\n\n41\n00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:55.715\nif I just install Windows Server 2012,\npromote it to a domain controller, and\n\n42\n00:01:55.715 --> 00:02:00.200\nbuild up a forest, it actually\ndoesn't have the Exchange attributes.\n\n43\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.960\nSo when we install Exchange,\n\n44\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.300\nit's expecting a lot of stuff to be\nin the AD that just isn't there yet.\n\n45\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.150\nSo before we can install\nour first Exchange server,\n\n46\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.320\nwe've gotta prepare the AD, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.440\nNow, what I'm about to show you is\nreally the same if you're doing\n\n48\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.560\nyour very first Exchange server or if\nyou're upgrading from a previous version.\n\n49\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.400\nIf it's your very first exchange server,\n\n50\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.100\nyou're active directory has no\nexchange records whatsoever.\n\n51\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.580\nSo we need to prepare the AD\nto have those records.\n\n52\n00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.610\nIf you're running exchange 2010 or\nexchange 2007,\n\n53\n00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.560\nor one of the earlier versions,\n\n54\n00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.160\nyour Active Directory does have Active\nDirectory record, or Exchange records.\n\n55\n00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.930\nBut they're the old records and\nExchange 2013 added some new ones, so\n\n56\n00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.100\nwe have to prepare the AD\nto add the new ones, right.\n\n57\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.580\nSo either way we've gotta\nrun through this process.\n\n58\n00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.690\nBut the key thing to remember here\nis that this absolutely must be done\n\n59\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.560\nbefore you install the first\nExchange 2013 server, all right.\n\n60\n00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.350\nSo let's run over some of\nthe prerequisites before we even\n\n61\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.220\nreally get started because there's\na few things we need to do.\n\n62\n00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.720\nFirst off, our Active Directory\nhas a forest functional level.\n\n63\n00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.930\nAnd that forest functional level needs to\nbe set to Windows Server 2003 or higher.\n\n64\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.240\nSo, if you're still running in\nWindows 2000 mode in your forest or\n\n65\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.410\nif you're back in mixed mode,\none of those really old modes.\n\n66\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.990\nYou can't run a Exchange 2013.\n\n67\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.750\nSo you need to be in 2003 or higher.\n\n68\n00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.395\nFortunately, 2003 has been out for what?\n\n69\n00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:24.960\n12, 13 years now?\n\n70\n00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.410\nIt's really old.\n\n71\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.430\nIt should be safe to go to that.\n\n72\n00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.280\nBut that means that if you're\ngoing to deploy Exchange 2013,\n\n73\n00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.480\nall of your Windows 2000 domain\ncontrollers have to be gone.\n\n74\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.510\nThey've got to be gone.\n\n75\n00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.100\nYou've got to be on 2003 and\nhigher, right?\n\n76\n00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.400\nThe other thing is,\n\n77\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.690\nwe're gonna need some permissions\nto be able to do this deployment.\n\n78\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.330\nWe need to modify the Active Directory.\n\n79\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.590\nAnd when you modify the Active Directory,\nthere's different partitions inside of\n\n80\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.910\nthere and you need different\npermissions to do stuff.\n\n81\n00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.630\nWe need to prepare our domain as well\nas prepare our schema, all right?\n\n82\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.630\nNow, you might not be\nfamiliar with the schema so\n\n83\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.310\nlet me just cover this real quickly.\n\n84\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.120\nInside of Active Directory,\nwe have objects.\n\n85\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.490\nObjects like user accounts,\ngroups, computer accounts.\n\n86\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.370\nAnd each of those objects\nhas things that describe it.\n\n87\n00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.330\nSo like if you pull up my user account,\nthere's things that describe me.\n\n88\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.130\nLet me show you here.\n\n89\n00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.950\nSo I'll take this.\n\n90\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.010\nThis is a domain controller.\n\n91\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.040\nIt doesn't have Exchange.\n\n92\n00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.700\nIt hasn't been prepared.\n\n93\n00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.768\nAnd if I go into\nActive Directory > Users and\n\n94\n00:04:17.768 --> 00:04:20.860\nComputers\n>> So let me just jump in there.\n\n95\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.370\nI'll find my user object.\n\n96\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.500\nSo I'm gonna browse in here and\nI'll find Don Pezet.\n\n97\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.210\nI'm in here somewhere.\n\n98\n00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.220\nThere I am.\n\n99\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.980\nSo here's my user object.\n\n100\n00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.060\nAnd my user object has what\nare called attributes attached to it.\n\n101\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.810\nFirst name, last name,\ndisplay name, description.\n\n102\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.180\nThese are attributes.\n\n103\n00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.760\nNow how does Active Directory\nknow to gather this information?\n\n104\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.680\nWell in the background there's\na thing called a schema and\n\n105\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.860\nthe schema says a user object\nshould have a first name,\n\n106\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.500\na user object should have a last name,\na user object should have an account.\n\n107\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.470\nVersus when I pull up a group.\n\n108\n00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.160\nThe schema says well a group\ndoesn't have a first name,\n\n109\n00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.829\na group doesn't have a last name.\n\n110\n00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.505\nA group has a description, an email,\nbut not a first and last name.\n\n111\n00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:01.340\nIt's the scheme that defines that.\n\n112\n00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.220\nSo the Exchange schema says,\n\n113\n00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.535\noh by the way, not only should a user\nhave a first name and a last name, but\n\n114\n00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:11.565\nthey should also have an email address or\nmultiple email addresses.\n\n115\n00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:13.175\nThey should have a mailbox server.\n\n116\n00:05:13.175 --> 00:05:14.725\nThey should have this and that and\n\n117\n00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:18.385\nall these other attributes that\npertain to email and collaboration.\n\n118\n00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:19.225\nAll right?\n\n119\n00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:21.725\nSo that all has to get\nadded to the schema.\n\n120\n00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:23.655\nNow by default, we don't see the schema.\n\n121\n00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:24.615\nIt's hidden in the background.\n\n122\n00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:25.185\nWe don't touch it.\n\n123\n00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:28.830\nMicrosoft actually goes to some\nlength to make sure we never see it.\n\n124\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.710\nThe main reason is, once you modify\nthe schema you can't undo it.\n\n125\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.410\nYou can't take this back.\n\n126\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.950\nOnce you've prepared your Active Directory\nfor Exchange, it's prepared forever.\n\n127\n00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.060\nEven if you uninstall\nyour exchange servers and\n\n128\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.752\nget rid of them, your Active Directory\nis still prepared for it.\n\n129\n00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:45.555\nAll right, and\nthat's a limitation of the schema.\n\n130\n00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:49.965\nWhen you add something to the schema you\ncan disable it but you can't delete it.\n\n131\n00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:51.155\nIt's there permanently.\n\n132\n00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:53.985\nSo you really need to make sure this is\nsomething you want to do before you get in\n\n133\n00:05:53.985 --> 00:05:55.625\nthere and prepare it.\n\n134\n00:05:55.625 --> 00:06:00.375\nSo, some of the other things I need to\nknow here, because this is something that\n\n135\n00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:03.760\ncan't be reversed,\nwe need to jump through a few hoops.\n\n136\n00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.430\nFirst off, in your active directory forest\nyou'll have what's called a schema master.\n\n137\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.600\nThe schema master is the one server,\n\n138\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.680\nit's just one, one domain controller\nthat's responsible for the schema.\n\n139\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.700\nEvery other server has a read\nonly copy of the schema, so\n\n140\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.570\nonly one server's allowed\nto modify the schema.\n\n141\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.610\nAnd only users in the schema admins\ngroup are allowed to modify it.\n\n142\n00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.750\nAnd guess who's in the schema\nadmins group by default?\n\n143\n00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.360\nNo one.\n\n144\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.140\nIt's empty.\n\n145\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.830\nNobody can modify the schema by default.\n\n146\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.350\nSo if I want to modify the schema,\nI've got to put myself into the schema\n\n147\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.410\nadmins group, and\nI've gotta connect to the schema master.\n\n148\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.210\nAnd make that change, and\nactually prep the AD.\n\n149\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.680\nSo I need to do a little bit of homework\nbefore I actually get in here and\n\n150\n00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.620\nstart to do my work.\n\n151\n00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.570\nRight?\nSo let me show you guys that homework,\n\n152\n00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.590\nhow we can kind of figure this out.\n\n153\n00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.790\nSo here on my system the first thing\nI wanna check, cuz I'm already in\n\n154\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.780\nActive Directory Users and Computers, I\nwant to check my forest functional level.\n\n155\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.320\nI'm gonna pick my domain.\n\n156\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.463\nAnd I'm gonna right click on that and\nchoose Raise Domain Functional Level and\n\n157\n00:07:04.463 --> 00:07:06.156\nI'm gonna take a look at here and\n\n158\n00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:09.183\nit's gonna give me my domain\nfunctional level, right.\n\n159\n00:07:09.183 --> 00:07:12.920\nSo I can see my domain has a functional\nlevel of Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\n160\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.050\nI'm looking for that to be 2003 or higher.\n\n161\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.070\nAnd that's my domain functional level.\n\n162\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.650\nI also have a forest functional level and\nwe can see that in another tool.\n\n163\n00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.250\nIf I go up to here to my tools and\ninto Active Directory Domains and\n\n164\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.640\nTrusts, right in here, if I right-click\non Active Directory Domains and\n\n165\n00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.400\nTrusts you'll see\nRaise Forest Functional Level.\n\n166\n00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.030\nAnd you can click on that and\nyou'll see I'm at Windows server 2012.\n\n167\n00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.110\nI'm looking for 2003 or higher.\n\n168\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.230\nRight, and I can move that.\n\n169\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.700\nNow, be careful if you need to move yours.\n\n170\n00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.230\nIf yours is 2000,\nyou only have to go to 2003.\n\n171\n00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.148\nYou don't have to go all the way to 2012.\n\n172\n00:07:45.148 --> 00:07:48.930\nAll right, now, you might ask yourself,\nwhy wouldn't I go to the latest?\n\n173\n00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.860\nTwo reasons.\n\n174\n00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.940\nReason number one, you can't go back.\n\n175\n00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.256\nOnce you go forward,\nyou can't go back again, all right.\n\n176\n00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:58.210\nSo only move as far\nforward as you have to go.\n\n177\n00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.471\nNever move all the way\nif you don't have to.\n\n178\n00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:04.711\nAnd the reason there is, if you jump\nto 2012, you can no longer have\n\n179\n00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:09.550\nWindows Server 2003,\nWindows Server 2008 domain controllers.\n\n180\n00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.500\nYou can still have Windows Server\n2008 member servers, but\n\n181\n00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.810\nnot domain controllers.\n\n182\n00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.900\nSo you're limiting the domain\ncontrollers that you can have.\n\n183\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.330\nNow that might be a good thing.\n\n184\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.090\nMight be a bad thing right?\n\n185\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.020\nYou might not want that.\n\n186\n00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.680\nSo only goes as far as you need.\n\n187\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.730\nAnd for Exchange 2013, Windows Server 2003\nmode that's as far as you need to go.\n\n188\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.270\nAll right.\n\n189\n00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.300\nSo make sure you're there.\n\n190\n00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.190\nI can see my domain level and\nmy forest function level are the same.\n\n191\n00:08:32.115 --> 00:08:33.605\nAll right, the next thing.\n\n192\n00:08:33.605 --> 00:08:36.735\nI need to put myself in\nthe schema admin's group.\n\n193\n00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:38.355\nNow I don't need to stay in there forever.\n\n194\n00:08:38.355 --> 00:08:40.075\nI just need to be in there\nwhile I make this change, and\n\n195\n00:08:40.075 --> 00:08:41.455\nthen I can take myself\nout of the group again.\n\n196\n00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:42.425\nAnd that's a good idea.\n\n197\n00:08:42.425 --> 00:08:43.975\nDon't leave yourself in the group.\n\n198\n00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:47.255\nBecause if you accidentally make a change\nto the schema, which is pretty hard to do.\n\n199\n00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:49.255\nBut if you do, you can't undo it.\n\n200\n00:08:49.255 --> 00:08:50.025\nThe way you undo it.\n\n201\n00:08:50.025 --> 00:08:51.180\nThis is fun.\n\n202\n00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.200\nYou shut down all your domain controllers\nand you restore them all from backup.\n\n203\n00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.110\nIt's a good time, right?\n\n204\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.090\nYou don't want to do that even if\nyou only have one domain controller,\n\n205\n00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.290\nyou don't want to do that, right?\n\n206\n00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.920\nSo, take yourself out of\nthat group when you're done.\n\n207\n00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.180\nSo I'm gonna go back to my\nActive Directory Users and Computers, And\n\n208\n00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.770\nI'll go under users here and\nI'm gonna find the Schema Admins Group.\n\n209\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.030\nIt's buried in here somewhere.\n\n210\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.680\nHere it is, Schema Admins.\n\n211\n00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.430\nAll right.\n\n212\n00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.770\nAnd I'm gonna put myself in there.\n\n213\n00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.545\nSo I'll go under Members and\nI'm gonna add in donpezet.\n\n214\n00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.830\nAnd there we go, now I'm a Schema Admin.\n\n215\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.752\nQuick work of caution here, remember when\nyou modify a user's group membership,\n\n216\n00:09:26.752 --> 00:09:30.058\nit doesn't actually take effect until\nthey log out and log back in, so\n\n217\n00:09:30.058 --> 00:09:33.887\nI just put myself in the Schema Admin's\ngroup, but I'm not really in there yet.\n\n218\n00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:37.280\nUntil I log out and log back in,\njust remember that.\n\n219\n00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.880\nNow there is another thing we have to do,\npreparing the Schema is one piece.\n\n220\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.820\nI also need to prepare my domain.\n\n221\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.160\nThere's certain service accounts,\n\n222\n00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.250\ncertain users, as well as certain\ngroups that Exchange expects to exist.\n\n223\n00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.190\nAnd it can create those for us.\n\n224\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.800\nBut in order to do that,\nI need to be a domain admin,\n\n225\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.040\nof the domain that I'm gonna prepare.\n\n226\n00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.390\nSo I need to make myself\na domain admin for that domain.\n\n227\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.490\nNow you might just be\nan Exchange administrator,\n\n228\n00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.790\nand there's a separate\nactive directory group.\n\n229\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.370\nSo you might have to reach\nover to them and say, hey,\n\n230\n00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.490\nI need you guys to run this command for me\nbecause you're the domain admins, right?\n\n231\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.160\nSo this might not all be you doing it.\n\n232\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.390\nIn a large environment, you might have an\nExchange team, an active directory team,\n\n233\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.180\na network team, all kinda divided up.\n\n234\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.150\nSo you might have to delegate\nthis out to somebody else.\n\n235\n00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.130\nJust be aware of that.\n\n236\n00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.980\nAll right, now I do get a choice here.\n\n237\n00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.180\nIf I'm just prepping one domain,\nI can make myself a domain admin for\n\n238\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.440\nthat domain and that's it.\n\n239\n00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.080\nBut if I wanna prep all\nof my domains at once,\n\n240\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.560\nI can put myself in\nthe Enterprise admins group.\n\n241\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.620\nIn the Enterprise admins group,\n\n242\n00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.260\nthat's like making me a domain admin for\nall of my domains.\n\n243\n00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.404\nNow, if you're just an Exchange admin\nthen you're probably not gonna have that\n\n244\n00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:45.903\npermission, but if you're\na smaller environment you may, and\n\n245\n00:10:45.903 --> 00:10:47.633\nyou can just come in and\nadd yourself there.\n\n246\n00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:52.001\nI'll put myself in there too so\nI can prepare all of my domains, and\n\n247\n00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:53.650\nwe can do it all at once.\n\n248\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.450\nNow just because you've deployed Exchange\nin one of your domains doesn't mean you\n\n249\n00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.260\nhave it in every domain.\n\n250\n00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.970\nYou might have five domains and\nyou're just doing Exchange in one of them?\n\n251\n00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.230\nYou've only gotta prep that one domain.\n\n252\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.270\nYou don't have to prep the other domains\nthat aren't going to run Exchange.\n\n253\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.185\nIt's up to you how you want to do that but\nwe normally prepare them all.\n\n254\n00:11:07.185 --> 00:11:09.050\nCuz it doesn't slow your server down,\n\n255\n00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.920\nit doesn't cost you any extra money,\nyou might as well prep the whole thing.\n\n256\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.110\nAnd so that's how that normally is.\n\n257\n00:11:15.072 --> 00:11:17.170\nAll right, so\nI'm in the Enterprise Admin's group and\n\n258\n00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.430\nI'm in the Schema Admin's group,\nthat's cool.\n\n259\n00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.300\nMy forest functional level is high enough,\nit's past Windows server 2003.\n\n260\n00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.050\nThe last thing I need to do is I\nneed to find my schema master.\n\n261\n00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.570\nAnd this is where it gets\na little bit challenging.\n\n262\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.720\nThere's a few different ways to do it,\nbut the GUI tool for\n\n263\n00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.010\nfinding your schema master is\nactually hidden by default.\n\n264\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.080\nWe can't get to it.\n\n265\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.850\nSo I wanna show you guys how to add\nthat in so you can quickly verify this.\n\n266\n00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.070\nWhat you can do is on any\nof your domain controllers,\n\n267\n00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.630\nif you basically fire up a run box.\n\n268\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:51.540\nI'm gonna do Windows Key+R\nto bring up my run box.\n\n269\n00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.630\nIn here you can do regsvr32,\n\n270\n00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:01.760\nI'm gonna register a service, regsvr32,\nand then what I'm registering and\n\n271\n00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.560\nI'm gonna do schmmgmt.dll, all right.\n\n272\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.430\nThat's a dynamic link library that\nhas the schema management tool.\n\n273\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.900\nI'm registering the schema\nmanagement tool.\n\n274\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.860\nI wanna make it available.\n\n275\n00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.460\nIt's not available by default.\n\n276\n00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.360\nAnd so when I run that, I'm gonna get,\noop, permission denied.\n\n277\n00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.580\nShoot.\nI forgot about that.\n\n278\n00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.330\nSo I need to get like an administrative\ncommand prompt up and running from here.\n\n279\n00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.660\nSo we'll redo that.\n\n280\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.080\nThere we go.\nAnd I'll get a nice little message letting\n\n281\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.850\nme know that the registration succeeded.\n\n282\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.910\nThat's going to make\nthe tool available for me so\n\n283\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.580\nI'll be able to,\nthrough my GUI, see the schema.\n\n284\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.790\nAnd that's important for two reasons.\n\n285\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.980\nOne, it's easier, right?\n\n286\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.990\nSo there's that.\n\n287\n00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.470\nAnd then two,\nI need to be able to see the schema so\n\n288\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.200\nI can verify these changes took effect.\n\n289\n00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.360\nThat it actually worked, right.\n\n290\n00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.440\nAnd I need that.\n\n291\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.313\nSo, I'm gonna need this.\n\n292\n00:12:46.313 --> 00:12:48.079\nSo I've just registered it.\n\n293\n00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:53.750\nNow I can fire up an MMC,\na Microsoft Management Console.\n\n294\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.260\nSo I'm just gonna come in here and\nrun MMC,\n\n295\n00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:00.040\nand that's going to open up\nan empty management console.\n\n296\n00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.210\nAnd I can go to File > Add/Remove Snap In,\nand\n\n297\n00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.760\nin here what I'm looking for\nis Active Directory Schema.\n\n298\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.900\nIf I had done this before registering\nthe DLL that wouldn't show up,\n\n299\n00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.900\nI wouldn't see Active Directory Schema.\n\n300\n00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.730\nBut because I registered it,\nnow it shows up and I can add it in.\n\n301\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.800\nAnd now I'll have the GUI tool for\nmanaging my schema.\n\n302\n00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.120\nAnd I can browse in here and\nI can see some of those objects,\n\n303\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.520\nthe classes that are defined.\n\n304\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.053\nSo like in here I can find users.\n\n305\n00:13:27.053 --> 00:13:30.663\nI'll find that user object\nburied in here somewhere and,\n\n306\n00:13:30.663 --> 00:13:32.610\nprobably down there in the Us.\n\n307\n00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.540\nThere it is, there's a user, and I can see\nall the things that are tied to that user.\n\n308\n00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.540\nAnd a lot of this stuff is gonna be\nconfusing, big, weird names, but\n\n309\n00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.210\nsome of it's gonna be really easy,\nlike first name, right?\n\n310\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.800\nFirst name's gotta be stored somewhere,\nso that'll be defined in here.\n\n311\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.180\nLet me sort this alphabetically.\n\n312\n00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.190\nApparently Microsoft has\na different alphabet than mine and\n\n313\n00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.650\nwe'll find our name.\n\n314\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.460\nOr, you know what, it's not first name\nit's like given name, or something.\n\n315\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.920\nThere it is, given name.\n\n316\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.340\nSo you've got given name and\n\n317\n00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.040\nyou've got different names like that for\neach of the different attributes.\n\n318\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.280\nTheir home directory.\n\n319\n00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.690\nGroup memberships and so on.\n\n320\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.530\nThese are the attributes for the users.\n\n321\n00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:10.610\nWell looking at this alphabetically,\nI don't see any Exchange one.\n\n322\n00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.180\nAnd you'll see like MSDS right,\n\n323\n00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.600\nthat's directory service and\nother ones that are listed here.\n\n324\n00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.350\nBut I don't see Exchange and\nthat's because it hasn't been prepared.\n\n325\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:22.200\nWell actually you know what,\nI do see three Microsoft Exchange,\n\n326\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.270\nMS Exchange Assistant Name,\nHouse Identifier, and Labelled URI.\n\n327\n00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.940\nSo there's three Exchange ones by default,\nI didn't put those there.\n\n328\n00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.540\nBut there should be a ton.\n\n329\n00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.360\nThere's a good 30 or 40 of them\nthat'll get added in when we prep it.\n\n330\n00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.740\nSo I can see that.\n\n331\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.630\nSo that's one reason that we wanna\nget in here is to verify it.\n\n332\n00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.078\nThe other thing is I can\nfind my schema master here.\n\n333\n00:14:41.078 --> 00:14:45.200\nIf you right-click on that Active\nDirectory schema, you'll see change, or\n\n334\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.890\nwait a minute here we go,\nOperations Master that's the one I want.\n\n335\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.650\nAnd that'll tell me who\nthe Operations Master is.\n\n336\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.990\nSo I can see mine's LAB-DC01.\n\n337\n00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.500\nThat's the server that's the schema\nmanager, or the schema master.\n\n338\n00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.360\nSo when I prep my AD,\nthat's where I need to do it from.\n\n339\n00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.050\nI need to do it from that server.\n\n340\n00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.620\nSo what we do is, we take our Exchange DVD\nand we walk over to that server.\n\n341\n00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.960\nAnd we pop it into the DVD drive, or\n\n342\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.210\nyou could copy the files over the network,\nthat's fine.\n\n343\n00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.740\nAnd then we can prepare the AD by using\nthe setup files from that Exchange disk\n\n344\n00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.060\nand it'll get everything ready for us.\n\n345\n00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.980\nNow for me, because I changed my group\nmembership, I need to logout and\n\n346\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.670\nlog back in.\n\n347\n00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:23.740\nI'm gonna save this console to my desktop\nso that I've got it when I come back in.\n\n348\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.650\nSo I'm gonna call this my Schema console.\n\n349\n00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.730\nAnd then I'm gonna log out.\n\n350\n00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.740\nAnd then when I log back in,\nI'm gonna be in the Enterprise admin's and\n\n351\n00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.000\nthe Schema admin's group.\n\n352\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.250\nSo I'll be good to go.\n\n353\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.950\nSo let me just sign out here.\n\n354\n00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.020\nAnd remember, I'm signing in and\n\n355\n00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.160\nout to make sure that my\ngroup membership is updated.\n\n356\n00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.250\nThat's why I'm gonna do that.\n\n357\n00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:46.860\nThere we go.\n\n358\n00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.300\nAnd now,\nI should be ready to prepare my AD.\n\n359\n00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.627\nSo I'm gonna pop in my Exchange disk\nwhich I'm pretty sure I already did.\n\n360\n00:15:52.627 --> 00:15:54.580\nYep, I got my Exchange disk right there.\n\n361\n00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.036\nSo there's Exchange 2013.\n\n362\n00:15:56.036 --> 00:15:59.795\nI'm gonna fire up a Command Prompt And\nI'm gonna run it with administrative\n\n363\n00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:02.569\nprivileges, right,\nwe do need to be running that way.\n\n364\n00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:05.406\nIf we're running it as a regular\nuser we've got permissions, but\n\n365\n00:16:05.406 --> 00:16:08.050\nwe won't get our UAC prompt and\nit will block it from running.\n\n366\n00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.000\nNow I'm running this\nfrom the server itself,\n\n367\n00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.090\nand I will tell you guys just from my\nown experience, I always do it this way.\n\n368\n00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:19.400\nI always run it from the Schema Master\nServer, from that actual server.\n\n369\n00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.490\nYou actually could run it from your\nworkstation, and there's a command-line\n\n370\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.710\ntag where you can tell it what\ndomain controller to connect to and\n\n371\n00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.920\nit reaches out over the network and\nit does it.\n\n372\n00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.360\nBut, what if something happens\nto your network connection?\n\n373\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.620\nWhat if something happens while\nyou're in the middle of it?\n\n374\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.770\nI really don't like that,\nI don't trust that.\n\n375\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.100\nSo I always do it from the Schema Master.\n\n376\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.100\nYou don't have to, but\nit's what I recommend.\n\n377\n00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.530\nFrom the Schema Master,\nthere's two commands that we're gonna run.\n\n378\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:49.200\nI'm gonna browse to my CD, so this is my\nD drive where my Exchange disk is, and\n\n379\n00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.700\nif I pull up a listing you'll see\nall the different language packs and\n\n380\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.860\nstuff that are in there.\n\n381\n00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.050\nBut the one that I really care about\nis this guy right here, Setup.EXE.\n\n382\n00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.820\nNow if I were to double click that,\nit runs the GUI installer for Exchange.\n\n383\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.170\nI don't want to install Exchange.\n\n384\n00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.960\nI just want to get my\nactive directory prepared.\n\n385\n00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.950\nSo the first command I'm gonna\nrun is going to extend my Schema.\n\n386\n00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:09.740\nIt's gonna add those attributes and\n\n387\n00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.850\nthis is the command that somebody needs\nto be in the Schema Admin group to run.\n\n388\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:21.020\nAnd the command looks like this,\nwe run setup.exe/ PrepareAD.\n\n389\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.570\nThat's what's telling you,\nhey don't install Exchange.\n\n390\n00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.020\nWe don't wanna install Exchange on this\nserver, we just wanna get our AD ready.\n\n391\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.880\nAnd then we say OrganizationName, right.\n\n392\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.320\nThis is gonna create\nan Exchange organization.\n\n393\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.750\nIf this is not your first Exchange Server,\nif you had Exchange 2010 or\n\n394\n00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.630\nearlier you already have an organization\nname, you can leave this off, all right?\n\n395\n00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:44.670\nBut if this is your very first install,\nit's important you provide\n\n396\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.210\nthe organization name because otherwise\nit'll call it default organization.\n\n397\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.790\nAnd little fact about organization names,\nyou can't change them.\n\n398\n00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.340\nSo the rest of your life,\nyou're going to have default organization.\n\n399\n00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.520\nNow, the organization name,\nthe end users never see it.\n\n400\n00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.100\nEnd users never see this at all, so\nyou could really put whatever you wanted.\n\n401\n00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:05.310\nBut because you can't change it, it's\nimportant that you pick something right.\n\n402\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.300\nFigure out what your company name is,\nor whatever, or\n\n403\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.250\ncome to some kind of agreement and\nspecify it.\n\n404\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:15.600\nSo I'm gonna call mine ITProTV Lab,\nso this my lab.\n\n405\n00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.950\nYou can do letters, numbers,\nspaces, it's limited, I think,\n\n406\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.160\nto 64 characters is what it's limited to.\n\n407\n00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.600\nYou can't do special characters,\nyou can do hyphens, but\n\n408\n00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.850\nyou can't do exclamation points or\nat symbol, it won't let you do those.\n\n409\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.360\nBut letters, numbers, spaces,\nhyphens, up to 64 characters.\n\n410\n00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.551\nAnd then lastly, I need to say\n\n411\n00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:44.992\nIAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms.\n\n412\n00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:46.442\nAll right?\nThat's gonna word wrap on\n\n413\n00:18:46.442 --> 00:18:47.301\nme a little bit there.\n\n414\n00:18:47.301 --> 00:18:51.144\nBut basically I'm just telling it,\nthere's that End User License Agreement,\n\n415\n00:18:51.144 --> 00:18:52.510\nI'm going to agree to that.\n\n416\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.350\nSo I'm saying prepare the AD,\nit's gonna extend my Schema.\n\n417\n00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:59.300\nHere's my organization name since\nthis is a new organization.\n\n418\n00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.890\nAgain if I had an organization\nalready I can leave that off, and\n\n419\n00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.560\nthen I accept the licensing term.\n\n420\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.400\nNow when I run that,\nit's gonna run and hopefully succeed.\n\n421\n00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.940\nNow there's some things that\ncan make this not work, right?\n\n422\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.885\nYou really do need to have the .NET\nFramework version 4.5.2 installed.\n\n423\n00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:16.892\nIf you've done your Windows updates,\nyou've got it.\n\n424\n00:19:16.892 --> 00:19:19.020\nIf you haven't done your Windows updates,\nyou might not.\n\n425\n00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.110\nSo make sure you've got\nthe .NET Framework in place and\n\n426\n00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.710\nyou also need the Windows Management\nFramework Version 4.0, which if you're\n\n427\n00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.790\nrunning WIndows Server 2012 R2 it's\nalready included, it's already there.\n\n428\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.580\nIf you're running Windows\nserver 2012 not R2,\n\n429\n00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.880\nif you've done your Windows\nupdates you've already got it.\n\n430\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.384\nBut if you're running Windows\nserver 2008 it doesn't have it.\n\n431\n00:19:38.384 --> 00:19:40.335\nYou need to go and\ndownload it and install it.\n\n432\n00:19:40.335 --> 00:19:44.229\nSo, it's going to do some prerequisite\nchecks and that's where it's looking for\n\n433\n00:19:44.229 --> 00:19:45.090\nthat stuff.\n\n434\n00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:49.880\nIt's looking, am I running Windows\nserver 2008 or 2012, right?\n\n435\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.210\nBecause you can install Exchange 2013\non Windows server 2008 if you want.\n\n436\n00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.620\n2012 is the better route,\nbut 2008 will work.\n\n437\n00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:01.280\nIt does need to be Windows Server\n2008 service pack one or higher.\n\n438\n00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.010\nSo you've got to make sure your service\npacks, but otherwise it'll do it.\n\n439\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.350\nAfter it checks that then it's going\nto start extending the Schema and\n\n440\n00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.060\nthat's actually what\nit's doing right here.\n\n441\n00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.710\nIt's preparing my organization and\nI get a nice little percentage and\n\n442\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.124\nit's going to track that and\nmove it along.\n\n443\n00:20:13.124 --> 00:20:18.760\nThe .NET framework, .NET Framework 4.5 is\nincluded with the Windows Server 2012,\n\n444\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.450\nbut it's a feature,\nyou might need to add that feature.\n\n445\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.690\nSo if you go back to your server\nmanager and Manage, Add Roles and\n\n446\n00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:31.700\nFeatures, inside of your Features,\nI'm just gonna move through this.\n\n447\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.290\nI'll skip the Role screen, so\nI don't wanna mess with my roles.\n\n448\n00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:39.484\nBut on the feature side you'll\nsee .NET Framework 4.5, okay,\n\n449\n00:20:39.484 --> 00:20:43.100\nit's 4.5.0, and we need 4.5.2.\n\n450\n00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.830\nSo, if you install that, you then need to\ndo Windows Updates afterwards to make sure\n\n451\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.070\nyou go 4.5.2 or\nyou can go and download it.\n\n452\n00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.000\nAll right, so we need to have that\nin place to be able to run ADprep.\n\n453\n00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.190\nSo those are some of the things\nthat can cause it to fail.\n\n454\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.590\nBut otherwise, you usually just\nlet it run and it cruises along.\n\n455\n00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.330\nIt doesn't take too terribly long,\nbut what it's doing in the background\n\n456\n00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:07.120\nis it's modifying a Schema,\nadding in a bunch of attributes for that,\n\n457\n00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.230\nit's creating another active directory\npartition inside of the configuration\n\n458\n00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:15.090\npartition to define our Exchange configs\nand what servers would exist and so on,\n\n459\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.010\nall the different containers,\nthe folders that store that data.\n\n460\n00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.080\nSo it's working on all of\nthat in the background and\n\n461\n00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.240\nit's doing it right here\non the Schema Manager.\n\n462\n00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.540\nNow I didn't do it, but there was another\ncommand line tag I could have done,\n\n463\n00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.210\nwhich is slash domain controller and\nyou can specify a DC.\n\n464\n00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.890\nSo if you want to run it from your\nwork station or another server,\n\n465\n00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.180\nyou would use /domain controller: and\nthen the name of your Schema Master.\n\n466\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.920\nIt does need to be that\nSchema Master though,\n\n467\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.600\nbecause we're modifying the Schema,\nall right?\n\n468\n00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.510\nSo, it's going to churn along.\n\n469\n00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.700\nNow, it's getting the Schema ready.\n\n470\n00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.380\nWhen it's done,\nI need to prepare my domain.\n\n471\n00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.250\nAnd preparing the domain goes much faster.\n\n472\n00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.140\nBecause all it's doing is creating\nsome users in groups, and that's it.\n\n473\n00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.020\nIt actually creates one or two OUs in\nyour active directory and that's it.\n\n474\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.380\nSo while this is running, if I go back to\nmy active directory, users and computers.\n\n475\n00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.000\nAnd I take a look at it, you can see my\nfolders here as I look down the side.\n\n476\n00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.960\nWe've got things like, well actually\none of them has already appeared,\n\n477\n00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.780\nMicrosoft Exchange security groups.\n\n478\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.550\nThat wasn't there a few moments ago,\nit just got created\n\n479\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.690\nbecause my AD is being prepared\nright now in the background, right.\n\n480\n00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:19.460\nSo it's creating that and we'll see that\nit does that for this domain that I'm in,\n\n481\n00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.910\nbut not the other domains\nin my organization.\n\n482\n00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.700\nSo I need to get those prepared, and\nthat'll be my next step is preparing them.\n\n483\n00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.210\nBut it also creates a few user accounts,\n\n484\n00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.310\nwe'll start to see some other things pop\nup, we'll verify all that in a minute.\n\n485\n00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.520\nAll right, looks like this one's done.\n\n486\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.750\nMy Schema has now been extended.\n\n487\n00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:36.890\nHow do I know it worked?\n\n488\n00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.580\nWell, I can go and verify that.\n\n489\n00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.550\nI've got my handy dandy Schema tool\nthat we've built up at the beginning\n\n490\n00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.900\nof the episode.\n\n491\n00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.380\nAnd if I go back into this and\nI'm just gonna browse in here and\n\n492\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.840\nfind the User Class.\n\n493\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.680\nWhich was down here at the bottom.\n\n494\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.060\nSo here's my User Class and\nall the attributes tied to my user.\n\n495\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.900\nI'm gonna scroll down and\nwhat I should see, here it is.\n\n496\n00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.955\nRemember from the beginning\nof the episode,\n\n497\n00:23:02.955 --> 00:23:05.660\nthere were three MS Exchange attributes.\n\n498\n00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.650\nNow I start right here and\nif I scroll down, let me just scroll and\n\n499\n00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.480\nscroll and scroll, there's a few,\nthere's a few Exchange attributes here.\n\n500\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.220\nGood gosh there's probably, well, there's\ngot to be at least 100 of them right?\n\n501\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.310\nThese are all Exchange attributes\nthat have been added in the Schema.\n\n502\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.800\nI'm still scrolling, there we go,\nthere's the end of it right there.\n\n503\n00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.970\nAnd so we can see that's a huge\namount of attributes that it added.\n\n504\n00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.360\nThose are all attributes that\nwe can never get rid of.\n\n505\n00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:32.960\nThey're permanent.\n\n506\n00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.960\nThey're a part of the Schema now, right?\n\n507\n00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.280\nIf I store data in there,\nit's going to stay there.\n\n508\n00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.410\nI can disable the attributes but\n\n509\n00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.930\nthey're still gonna reside in\nthe four Schema forever right.\n\n510\n00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.010\nSo those stay there.\n\n511\n00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:48.851\nThat's what preparing the AD did,\nit created all of those.\n\n512\n00:23:48.851 --> 00:23:52.427\nNow if I only have one domain,\nI could actually stop right there,\n\n513\n00:23:52.427 --> 00:23:56.250\nit did prepare my domain too\nbecause I'm in that domain.\n\n514\n00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:00.300\nBut if I have more than one domain\nI gotta prepare my other domains.\n\n515\n00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.557\nAnd I can do them one at a time or\nI can do them all at once.\n\n516\n00:24:03.557 --> 00:24:06.429\nIf I want to do them one at a time, I'm\njust gonna bring up this command line that\n\n517\n00:24:06.429 --> 00:24:09.430\nI ran a moment ago and\nI'm gonna modify it a little bit.\n\n518\n00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.440\nIf I want to do them one at a time,\n\n519\n00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.120\nI can get rid of this organization since\nthat's already created, I don't need that.\n\n520\n00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.890\nAnd I can get PrepareAD and\nchange that to PrepareDomain, so\n\n521\n00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.630\nnow it's just preparing\na particular domain.\n\n522\n00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.830\nAnd I can then specify the domain\nthat I want to prepare.\n\n523\n00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:32.500\nSo mine is lab.itprov.tv,\nthat's the domain I wanna prepare.\n\n524\n00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.240\nAnd then I accept the licensing terms.\n\n525\n00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.300\nSo that's gonna get that\none domain prepared.\n\n526\n00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:41.610\nI need to be a domain admin for that\ndomain in order for this command to work.\n\n527\n00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.190\nAnd you can run this on\nany domain controller.\n\n528\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.950\nThis doesn't have to be run\non the Schema Admin anymore.\n\n529\n00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.130\nAll right.\nSo if you're a really big company,\n\n530\n00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:52.800\nyou might have a Schema team and then a\nregular AD team, so the Schema team might\n\n531\n00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.270\nrun the PrepareAD, and then the regular\nserver admin team runs the PrepareDomain.\n\n532\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.780\nBut if you're an Enterprise admin like\nI am, you can make it even easier,\n\n533\n00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:10.890\nbecause you can change this to\nsay PrepareAllDomains, alright.\n\n534\n00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.320\nWhen we say prepare all domains,\nit says get them all.\n\n535\n00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.630\nJust knock them all out at once.\n\n536\n00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.993\nOne big command,\nyou do need to be an Enterprise admin for\n\n537\n00:25:16.993 --> 00:25:19.220\nthis because it's got to\nrun across all the domains.\n\n538\n00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.260\nAnd so that's going to reach out and\nknock them out.\n\n539\n00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.320\nThat's going to run pretty quick.\n\n540\n00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.950\nJust creating some users some\ngroups setting some permissions.\n\n541\n00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:27.720\nNothing too fancy.\n\n542\n00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.500\nBut, while it's running let\nme just mention something.\n\n543\n00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.530\nLet's say you get hired somewhere.\n\n544\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.950\nAnd you can see those Exchange\nattributes in the active directory but\n\n545\n00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:40.510\nyou don't know if it's 2010 or 2013 or\n2007, you don't know, all right.\n\n546\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.350\nIt doesn't hurt to run these commands\na second time or a third time or\n\n547\n00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.630\na fourth time or a fifth time.\n\n548\n00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.950\nIf the attributes already exist,\nit just skips over them.\n\n549\n00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.740\nIf the users and the groups already exist,\nit skips over them.\n\n550\n00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.270\nBut anything that's missing,\nit'll put in there.\n\n551\n00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.130\nSo if you're not sure whether\nyou're running the latest ones,\n\n552\n00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.660\nit doesn't hurt to go ahead and\nredo the prep.\n\n553\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.450\nYou can rerun it, it'll churn right\nthrough, and it'll get them updated.\n\n554\n00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.290\nSo, when in doubt, just run them again.\n\n555\n00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.693\nAlright so at the end of the day there are\nreally two commands that I ran here right?\n\n556\n00:26:06.693 --> 00:26:11.670\nSetup/PrepareAD and\nsetup/preparealldomains.\n\n557\n00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:12.580\nThose two.\n\n558\n00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.670\nPrepare AD, they got my Schema ready and\nthat had to be run on the Schema Admin.\n\n559\n00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.950\nPrepare all domains, that got all my\ndomains ready and that could be run on any\n\n560\n00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.120\ndomain controller I just need to\nmake sure I have the permissions.\n\n561\n00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.290\nWhen that's done,\nI've now got all my attributes in the AD,\n\n562\n00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:31.350\nand I've got my various other accounts\ncreated in the active director it self.\n\n563\n00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:32.830\nSo if I go to active director users and\n\n564\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:37.910\ncomputers, now we expect to see\nif you didnt see it before,\n\n565\n00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:41.300\nnow you'll see that Microsoft exchange\nsecurity groups and all the groups that\n\n566\n00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.790\nare inside of there under users, you'll\nsee the Exchange online application.\n\n567\n00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.980\nThat's allowing our hooks to Azure.\n\n568\n00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.230\nSo it'll have that.\n\n569\n00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.120\nSo you'll see a few\nother things like that.\n\n570\n00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.890\nAs well as some hidden objects,\n\n571\n00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.840\nthat only turn up when you go\ninto like your advanced views.\n\n572\n00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.350\nWhen you start to turn these on,\nyou can dig and\n\n573\n00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.360\nthen you'll see some more\nthings buried in here.\n\n574\n00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.150\nLike these Microsoft Exchange system\nobjects that are hidden by default.\n\n575\n00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.900\nAnd that's where you can jump in and start\nsee your monitoring mailboxes and so on.\n\n576\n00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.490\nAll of that was created\nby preparing the AD.\n\n577\n00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.490\nWhen this is done,\nnow we can install Exchange.\n\n578\n00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.700\nIf we try to install Exchange\nbefore preparing it,\n\n579\n00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.190\nit would fail, it wouldn't work.\n\n580\n00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.960\nAlright so\nyou've got to prepare your AD first.\n\n581\n00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.480\nNow the newer installers that come with\nExchange 2013 will actually try and\n\n582\n00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.340\nprepare the AD for you.\n\n583\n00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.070\nBut you need to be in\nthe Schema Admins group.\n\n584\n00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.240\nYou need to be in the Enterprise Admins\ngroup in order for it to run.\n\n585\n00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.350\nIf your environment has divided roles,\nthat's not gonna work,\n\n586\n00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.890\nand you've gotta run it step by step\nlike I just did in this episode.\n\n587\n00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.120\nSo keep that in mind as you deploy it.\n\n588\n00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.290\nAll right,\nwell that takes care of preparing the AD.\n\n589\n00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.050\nOur next step is to\nactually install Exchange.\n\n590\n00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.710\nI'm a little short on time for\nthis episode so we'll save that for\n\n591\n00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:48.660\nthe next one and we'll wrap up right here.\n\n592\n00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:53.400\nSo in this segment we got a chance to see\ngetting our Active Directory, our Schema,\n\n593\n00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.780\ngetting all of that ready to\ndeploy Exchange the first time.\n\n594\n00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.380\nReal important steps.\n\n595\n00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.580\nAll right, well we'll go ahead and\nwrap it up here.\n\n596\n00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.480\nI hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n597\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.684\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n598\n00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:10.397\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.230\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.340\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Exchange 2013.\n\n5\n00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.950\nIn this segment, we're gonna take the\nplunge and get Exchange 2013 installed.\n\n6\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.140\nWe've talked about it in our previous\nepisodes, all the prep work we have to\n\n7\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.820\ndo to get ready to install,\nnow we're ready to pull the trigger.\n\n8\n00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.000\nThe installation's pretty straightforward,\nbut it does ask us a few questions that we\n\n9\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.410\nneed to be aware of and kinda understand\nthe repercussions of our decisions, right?\n\n10\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.640\nSo, first off let's just tackle\na couple of prerequisites we need to\n\n11\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.750\nmeet before we're able to do the install.\n\n12\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.250\nIf you're installing Exchange 2013,\n\n13\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.160\nfirst off,\nyour active directory has to be prepared.\n\n14\n00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.880\nYour schema and your AD have to\nbe ready to receive Exchange.\n\n15\n00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.780\nSo if you haven't already, jump back and\nwatch our episode on preparing the AD.\n\n16\n00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.900\nAssuming that's done, the server\nyou're going to install on needs to be\n\n17\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.980\nWindows Server 2008 with Service Pack 1 or\nhigher, or Windows Server 2012, all right?\n\n18\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.920\nThose are the two supported\noperating systems and\n\n19\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.470\nobviously Microsoft's recommendation.\n\n20\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.640\nThey want you to run it\non Windows Server 2012.\n\n21\n00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.760\nSo the server I'm going to\ninstall on is Windows 2012 R2.\n\n22\n00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.960\nYou can do it in 2008 if\nthat's what you've got or\n\n23\n00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.980\nthat's what you need to support.\n\n24\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.950\nIt's up to you how you wanna go about it.\n\n25\n00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.600\nAll right,\n\n26\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.040\nafter that there's couple little pieces\nof software that we need all right.\n\n27\n00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.010\nYou need to have the .NET\nframework version 4.5.2 installed.\n\n28\n00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.690\nNow in Windows Server 2012 and Windows\nServer 2008 it's not installed by default.\n\n29\n00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.010\nIn Server 2008, you can go to Microsoft's\nwebsite, and you can download it.\n\n30\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.120\nIn 2012,\nit's actually a feature you can turn on.\n\n31\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.430\nLet me show you where to\nfind that on the server.\n\n32\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.860\nSo here I'm on my server.\n\n33\n00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.710\nMy server's just called LAB-EXCHSERV01.\n\n34\n00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.895\nIt's not actually running.\n\n35\n00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:52.145\nExchange yet.\n\n36\n00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.765\nAnd if I go up here to manage and\nadd roles and\n\n37\n00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:57.025\nfeatures, we can move through this wizard.\n\n38\n00:01:57.025 --> 00:01:58.535\nNow, I don't want to add any roles.\n\n39\n00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.265\nI just want to mess with my features, so\nI'm just gonna hit next over and over and\n\n40\n00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:04.975\nover again until I get to my features\nscreen, and right here at the top of\n\n41\n00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:08.720\nfeatures you'll see dot net framework\n4.5 you need to install it and\n\n42\n00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.479\nthen, you need to do your\nWindows updates to get to 4.5.2.\n\n43\n00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.250\nAll right.\n\n44\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.240\nThat's the minimum version.\n\n45\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.730\nYou also need\nthe Windows Management Framework 4.0.\n\n46\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.430\nIf you're running Server 2012 R2, you've\nalready got it, it's part of the system.\n\n47\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.220\nIf you're running Windows Server 2012,\njust do your Windows updates.\n\n48\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.010\nBut if you're running Windows Server 2008,\nyou're gonna have to go and download it.\n\n49\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.880\nSo, you can go and download it\nright from Microsoft's website.\n\n50\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.520\nI'll post the links in the show notes.\n\n51\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.420\nIn Server 2008 you have to\ndownload .NET Framework 452 and\n\n52\n00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.450\nyou have to download\nthe Windows Framework 4.0.\n\n53\n00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.350\nYou also need the Unified Communications\nFramework even if you're not\n\n54\n00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.700\ngonna use the Unified Communications stuff\nthat service is installed by default and\n\n55\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.470\nyou've gotta have it installed.\n\n56\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.260\nNone of the versions of\nserver come with that.\n\n57\n00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.422\nYou're always gonna have to go and\ndownload that one.\n\n58\n00:02:53.422 --> 00:02:56.660\nAll right, now if you're missing any of\nthese components, when you do the install\n\n59\n00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.210\nit'll check, it'll see they're missing and\nit'll give you the links to download them.\n\n60\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.990\nBut what I do, I might install a few\nmore exchange servers then most people.\n\n61\n00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.170\nBut If you find yourself installing a lot,\nwhat I like to do is,\n\n62\n00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.820\nI create a little file\nwhere I store these things,\n\n63\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.000\nwhere I have the .net\nframework 4.5.2 right there.\n\n64\n00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.360\nI've got my\nWindows Management Framework 4.0 and\n\n65\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.140\nI've got the Unified Communications\nFramework right there.\n\n66\n00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.110\nSo, I just keep them handy, and when\nI'm building up a new exchange server,\n\n67\n00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.260\nI can just install those.\n\n68\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.300\nNow, in 2012,\nyou don't need the 452 installer, and\n\n69\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.860\nyou don't need the management framework.\n\n70\n00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.240\nYou just need the unified communications\nbut on 2008 you'd need all three.\n\n71\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.800\nSo you just install those, and you run.\n\n72\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.330\nNow when we do the install,\n\n73\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.720\nyou're gonna have to pick between whether\nyou're doing a edge transport server,\n\n74\n00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.870\na client access server, or a mailbox\nserver or maybe you're doing all three.\n\n75\n00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.330\nWell, there's some services,\n\n76\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.260\nsome roles that need to be\ninstalled ahead of time, and.\n\n77\n00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.610\nIf you go to Microsoft's website, they\ngive you the list, it's a massive list of\n\n78\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.530\nall sorts of different roles and\nso it's hard to keep track of.\n\n79\n00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.970\nAnd this is another one that I\nusually keep in a handy file, and\n\n80\n00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.380\nyou'll see mine right here,\nPowerShell install.\n\n81\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.160\nWhen you install Exchange, there's\ncertain roles and features you need and\n\n82\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.540\nthe installer will actually add them for\nyou.\n\n83\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.700\nBut the problem is it's gonna make\nyou reboot during the install and\n\n84\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.750\nthen you kinda gotta continue and\nit's really annoying so\n\n85\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.410\nit's something I like to do ahead of time.\n\n86\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.860\nAhead of time I like to go ahead and\ninstall these roles.\n\n87\n00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.820\nAnd so I've just kind of created\nthis power shell script that I run\n\n88\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.470\nthat has all the different roles and\nfeatures I need to have installed.\n\n89\n00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.340\nIf it's a client access server or a mail\nbox server, there's actually quite a few.\n\n90\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.820\nThis list,\nlet me turn on word wrap here so\n\n91\n00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.750\nyou guys kind of get the full experience.\n\n92\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.650\nThere we go.\n\n93\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.220\nIt's a lot of different things,\nit's hard to keep track of.\n\n94\n00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.900\nAnd I'll post this with the show notes too\nso you guys can have it, just remember,\n\n95\n00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.300\nif you don't have these\nit'll add these for you.\n\n96\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.560\nIt's just an extra reboot\nduring the install.\n\n97\n00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.800\nSo, if you're trying to save\nyourself from a reboot,\n\n98\n00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.210\nyou can install these ahead of time.\n\n99\n00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.410\nNow, if it's an edge transport\nserver you only need one.\n\n100\n00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.040\nYou need the lightweight directory\nservices, or the ADLDS, so\n\n101\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.410\nyou need to get that installed.\n\n102\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.210\nBut, if it's a client access or a mailbox\nyou need all of these guys up here.\n\n103\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.360\nAnd so what I usually do is take this and\n\n104\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.710\nthen I just jump into a power shell,\nwhich I'll run as an administrator.\n\n105\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.660\nAnd then we can just paste that right in.\n\n106\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.820\nAnd it's gonna run,\nit's gonna add all those rolls.\n\n107\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.190\nNow, I've already got them installed\nbecause it takes a good 10 or\n\n108\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.900\n15 minutes and I didn't think you guys\nwanted to sit here and watch that so\n\n109\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.520\nI did it before the show, but if you've\nalready got them, it just comes back and\n\n110\n00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.780\nsays success true, no restart needed.\n\n111\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.440\nBut if you didn't, it would actually sit\nthere and install all those roles and\n\n112\n00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.320\nfeatures, and when it was done it\nwould tell you you need to reboot.\n\n113\n00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.350\nAnd you can reboot and now your server's\nready for that Exchange install.\n\n114\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.030\nIf you don't do this, we'll see when it\ndoes the prerequisite check it will offer\n\n115\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.889\nto install them for us.\n\n116\n00:05:51.022 --> 00:05:53.680\nAll right, so I would do this\non my client access server or\n\n117\n00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.380\nmailbox server or if it's gonna be both,\nget this ready ahead of time.\n\n118\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.980\nSo those are my prerequisites.\n\n119\n00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.130\nAssuming I've met those,\nI'm ready to do my install.\n\n120\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.600\nI can get things set up.\n\n121\n00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.240\nAnd the install is actually\npretty straightforward.\n\n122\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.570\nYou pop in your exchange DVD and\nthen it's got an auto run that'll run.\n\n123\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.312\nIf you pop it in,\n\n124\n00:06:11.312 --> 00:06:14.280\nit'll offer to launch it you can\nrun it just like I did right there.\n\n125\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.044\nOn the very first screen it's gonna\nask if you wanna connect for updates.\n\n126\n00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.877\nThe DVD you have is probably out of date,\nright?\n\n127\n00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:22.046\nIf you even have a DVD.\n\n128\n00:06:22.046 --> 00:06:25.350\nYou might be downloading it from Microsoft\nin which case it might be up to date.\n\n129\n00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.545\nBut it'll offer to reach out\nto the internet to find that.\n\n130\n00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:30.325\nJust for the sake of time here,\nI'm gonna say don't check but,\n\n131\n00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:32.346\nin real life land,\nI always do check, right?\n\n132\n00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:36.519\nThere's updated installers, because\nwhat'll happen is Microsoft will release\n\n133\n00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:40.334\nhot fixes and patches for Windows that\nmight break the exchange installer,\n\n134\n00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:42.137\nand checking online will fix that.\n\n135\n00:06:42.137 --> 00:06:44.135\nI've already done all on my\nwindows updates, I should be fine.\n\n136\n00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.805\nOn the next it's copying files,\nit's copying from the DVD\n\n137\n00:06:48.805 --> 00:06:52.245\nto a local cache on the system to\nbe able to run the installer, and\n\n138\n00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.975\nthat's really important\nif we need to reboot.\n\n139\n00:06:53.975 --> 00:06:56.047\nIt wants to be able to\nresume where it left off and\n\n140\n00:06:56.047 --> 00:06:58.437\nit'll use that cache to\nkeep track of all of that.\n\n141\n00:06:58.437 --> 00:07:01.007\nSo it's gonna build that\nup it only takes a moment.\n\n142\n00:07:01.007 --> 00:07:03.517\nThen it's gonna start\nchecking our prerequisites.\n\n143\n00:07:03.517 --> 00:07:05.167\nActually I think we have\na license agreement first and\n\n144\n00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:06.927\nthen it checks our prerequisites.\n\n145\n00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:11.137\nThat's where it's gonna look to say,\ndo you have the .Net framework installed?\n\n146\n00:07:11.137 --> 00:07:13.437\nDo you have the Windows Management 4.0?\n\n147\n00:07:13.437 --> 00:07:16.980\nDo you have the Unified\nCommunications Framework installed?\n\n148\n00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.448\nAnd if you do great and if you don't it's\ngonna give you the link to download them.\n\n149\n00:07:20.448 --> 00:07:22.950\nIt's also gonna check all of\nthose roles and features but\n\n150\n00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.460\non those if it's missing it'll\njust install them for you.\n\n151\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.590\nSo that's kind of nice.\n\n152\n00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.420\nBut that prerequisite check\ncan take a little while.\n\n153\n00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.980\nSo here's my introduction,\nI'll just move past that.\n\n154\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.630\nThere's my good old licensing agreement.\n\n155\n00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.080\nSo I'll read that after,\nthoroughly reading it and\n\n156\n00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.650\nmaking sure I agree with every clause.\n\n157\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.300\nThen it's asking about how I'm going\nto do my communications with Microsoft.\n\n158\n00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.320\nDo I want to send\ninformation back to them?\n\n159\n00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.550\nDo I want to manually\nconfigure settings later on?\n\n160\n00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.480\nThis is the user experience program.\n\n161\n00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.080\nWhen you have a failure, in exchange\nit can report that to Microsoft.\n\n162\n00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.430\nIt's also things like\nbasic usage information.\n\n163\n00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.260\nThey use to determine their next products.\n\n164\n00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.195\nThey like to see how people\nare using the product.\n\n165\n00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:01.090\nYou can choose how you\nwanna go about that.\n\n166\n00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.387\nI'll go ahead and\nprovide feedback to them.\n\n167\n00:08:05.387 --> 00:08:06.902\nNow the Role Selection.\n\n168\n00:08:06.902 --> 00:08:11.023\nNow this screen's a little weird, because\nyou'll notice that there's some options\n\n169\n00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:14.692\nthat are in black and some options that\nare in gray, and unlike most systems,\n\n170\n00:08:14.692 --> 00:08:19.050\nyou know normally black mean's it's\nselected, gray means it's not selected.\n\n171\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:24.410\nBut on this one there's actually two\nshades of gray so it gets a little weird.\n\n172\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.990\nSome of them are really light gray.\n\n173\n00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.850\nLike this guy right here.\n\n174\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.080\nManagement tools.\n\n175\n00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.990\nAnd what that means is\nyou have to have it.\n\n176\n00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.860\nYou don't have a choice.\n\n177\n00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.700\nRight.\nAnd I can barely read it on my screen.\n\n178\n00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.650\nI know you guys on the video are probably\nhave a hard time reading that.\n\n179\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.800\nBut it says management tools, and\nyou can't turn that on or off.\n\n180\n00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.730\nThat one's on.\n\n181\n00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.930\nAll right.\n\n182\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.990\nThese other ones though that\nare a different light grey.\n\n183\n00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.020\nI know it's ridiculous, but these are ones\nthat we can choose to turn on if we want.\n\n184\n00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.050\nThe first time I did this install\nI thought, wow, why is it locked?\n\n185\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.755\nWhy can't I install client access?\n\n186\n00:08:54.755 --> 00:08:57.400\nCuz normally when I see light grey like\nthat, it means you can't click it.\n\n187\n00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.960\nBut in this case, you can.\n\n188\n00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.350\nYou can click it, and\nwhen I do see how it turned black?\n\n189\n00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.850\nAll right?\n\n190\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.690\nSo you can chose that if you want.\n\n191\n00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.260\nIt's just a weird, like,\nscreen effect that they do.\n\n192\n00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.950\nI don't know why they do that.\n\n193\n00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.010\nBut as you check these roles,\nyou'll notice things change.\n\n194\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.820\nLike when I click Client Access role,\nsee how Edge Transport disappeared?\n\n195\n00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.690\nI cannot check Edge Transport.\n\n196\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.770\nEdge Transport has to be all by itself.\n\n197\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.050\nIf I check it, see how Mailbox and\nClient Access role disappeared.\n\n198\n00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.340\nSo it's making sure I don't make\na mistake here on my install.\n\n199\n00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.220\nI need to figure out what\nI want this server to be.\n\n200\n00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.550\nMaybe I want it to mailbox and\nclient access.\n\n201\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.200\nI'm just gonna do a single\nserver deployment.\n\n202\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.040\nYou can do that.\n\n203\n00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.930\nRight.\n\n204\n00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.190\nBut in my case,\nI want to have a mailbox server and\n\n205\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.710\na separate client access server.\n\n206\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.930\nSo I'm just gonna check the mailbox role.\n\n207\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.520\nThen we'll see it's gonna\nautomatically install any roles and\n\n208\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.750\nfeatures that are missing.\n\n209\n00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.100\nThat big PowerShell command that I ran,\nif I missed anything,\n\n210\n00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.810\nit will fix it for me, right.\n\n211\n00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.540\nBut if I missed anything,\na re-boot is probably gonna be required.\n\n212\n00:09:53.822 --> 00:09:55.770\nAll right, so we'll hit next,\nnow it's gonna offer me the install.\n\n213\n00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.030\nIt's telling me it requires six gigs\nof space, almost seven gigs of space.\n\n214\n00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.880\nSo I need to have some hard drive space.\n\n215\n00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.910\nThat's not including my mailbox databases.\n\n216\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.330\nSo I need to understand how much mail I'm\ngoing to have, to determine how much hard\n\n217\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.870\ndrive space I truly need, but\njust for the install I need 6.6 gigs.\n\n218\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.745\nI'm going to leave it\nat the default of C:,\n\n219\n00:10:13.745 --> 00:10:16.740\nwe'll probably move our\nmailbox databases later on.\n\n220\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.610\nWe'll see that in the mailbox episodes,\nbut for\n\n221\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.760\nnow we'll just go with the defaults.\n\n222\n00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.200\nThen, my Exchange Organization.\n\n223\n00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.840\nNow notice my Exchange Organization\nis already filled in, and\n\n224\n00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.710\nthat's because when I prepared my AD,\nI gave it a name.\n\n225\n00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.700\nBut if this is my very first\nExchange server, I do actually have\n\n226\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.770\none last chance where I can go in and\nmodify that if I wanted to change it.\n\n227\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.220\nOnce this is done though, it's set in\nstone, and I can't change it again.\n\n228\n00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.160\nOnce your first Exchange Server\nis up that's it, it's locked in.\n\n229\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.050\nSo make sure you get that\nset the way that you want.\n\n230\n00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.080\nWe also see apply Active Directory\nsplit permission security model.\n\n231\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.950\nNow this is an interesting one.\n\n232\n00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.860\nBy default, administrators have access\nto certain things inside of Exchange,\n\n233\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.950\nthey can have access into\nother people's mailbox.\n\n234\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.890\nWe can split that to make sure that\nwe have separate responsibilities for\n\n235\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.160\nmanagement exchange versus\nmanagement of Active Directory.\n\n236\n00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.320\nSo you have Exchange admins that can't\nnecessarily do things in the AD,\n\n237\n00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.540\nand you have Active Directory admins that\ncan't necessarily do things in Exchange.\n\n238\n00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.230\nYou don't necessarily want your domain\nadmins to be able to open everybody's\n\n239\n00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.120\nmailbox.\n\n240\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.960\nSo you can turn that on if\nyou wanna split that off.\n\n241\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.940\nIf you've got a small IT department,\nand everybody works in Exchange,\n\n242\n00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.190\nthen leave it alone, go with the defaults,\ndomain admins or Exchange admin.\n\n243\n00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.540\nBut if you're in a big company,\nwere you have dedicated Exchange admins,\n\n244\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.120\ndedicated AD admins,\nyou'll wanna split that.\n\n245\n00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.150\nAnd so you can turn that on, and\nthat'll split those permissions for you.\n\n246\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.811\nYou can also change it after the fact,\nit's not that hard.\n\n247\n00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:45.640\nThen it's gonna ask about\nmalware protection.\n\n248\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.850\nBy default Exchange does do malware\nprotection, it's looking for\n\n249\n00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.540\nviruses inside of your email.\n\n250\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.760\nBut you might have third-party\nsoftware that already does that.\n\n251\n00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.870\nDoing it twice is gonna increase your\nCPU utilization, and it's gonna make it\n\n252\n00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.710\nwhere you have to look two different\nplaces to find your quarantine.\n\n253\n00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.380\nSo if you have some other system,\n\n254\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.640\nyou might wanna choose Yes to\nDisable malware scanning, all right?\n\n255\n00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.170\nBut if you don't,\nif you don't have anything else,\n\n256\n00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.200\nyou might as well use what\nExchange comes with and choose No.\n\n257\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.560\nThen the readiness checks.\n\n258\n00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.650\nThis is where it's checking\nthe prerequisites.\n\n259\n00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.190\nDo I have dot net framework 452 installed?\n\n260\n00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.560\nDo I have unified\ncommunications management?\n\n261\n00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.560\nDo I have those things?\n\n262\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.070\nAll right.\n\n263\n00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.180\nNow I purposely didn't install\nthe unified communications one, so\n\n264\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.380\nthat we'll see the error here.\n\n265\n00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.145\nOr at least I think I did.\n\n266\n00:12:27.145 --> 00:12:29.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll probably see that one missing.\n\n267\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.660\nAnd it tells you how to fix it.\n\n268\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.820\nIf it's something you need to download,\n\n269\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.460\nthat will give you a link\nto Microsoft to go and\n\n270\n00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.730\ndownload it, if it's a roller feature,\nit will try and resolve that for us.\n\n271\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.150\nSo it's just gonna check and\nlook for anything that's missing.\n\n272\n00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.510\nIf you're missing a lot of stuff, this\nReadiness Check can actually take a while.\n\n273\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.320\nI've seen it take ten minutes before,\n\n274\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.340\nas it kind of dug through everything\nto try and find what's missing.\n\n275\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.830\nIn my case, it's telling me I need to be a\nmember of the organization management role\n\n276\n00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.910\ngroup, if I'm gonna be working with this.\n\n277\n00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.860\nOr enterprise admins, well,\nI am in the Enterprise Admins group, so\n\n278\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.120\nthat's just a warning there.\n\n279\n00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.070\nIt says Error, but\nI'm actually fine as far as running this.\n\n280\n00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.550\nSome of the other things here,\nas we look down,\n\n281\n00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.530\nwe'll see that it's just warning\nme about my permissions.\n\n282\n00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.160\nSo I need to make sure I\nhave the right permissions.\n\n283\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.720\nAnd it's telling me\nwhat to do to fix that.\n\n284\n00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.600\nAnd then as I look down, this last one is\nthe only one I really need to correct.\n\n285\n00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.900\nThis computer requires the Microsoft\nunified communications managed API 4.0.\n\n286\n00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.440\nRight.\n\n287\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.940\nI've gotta have that API in place,\nbefore I can continue with the install.\n\n288\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.370\nSo I can just reach back here, and\n\n289\n00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.490\nI can install it,\nI've got it copied to my hard drive.\n\n290\n00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.860\nAnd so I'm gonna install that real quick,\nit's a pretty quick install,\n\n291\n00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.700\nit's not very big.\n\n292\n00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.450\nI think if you download the file it's,\nwhat is it, 240 megs.\n\n293\n00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.790\nBut the install doesn't have any options,\nyou just install it and\n\n294\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.920\nagree with the license and\nthat's about it.\n\n295\n00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.720\nSo there it goes, It's going to install\nand I'll meet that requirement.\n\n296\n00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.980\nIf you have questions on any of\nthe other ones that I posted,\n\n297\n00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.930\nyou can click on the link and\nMicrosoft can tell you all about it.\n\n298\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.250\nSo we'll give that a moment while\nthat churns through, and there we go.\n\n299\n00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.100\nOnce it's done, if it was a change\nthat didn't require a reboot,\n\n300\n00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.370\nI can just jump right back to\nmy wizard and I can hit retry.\n\n301\n00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.690\nAnd when you hit retry, it's gonna\nreevaluate, and see if we're fixed,\n\n302\n00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.070\nsee if we're fine and if it can move on.\n\n303\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.960\nSo we'll see what this one comes back\nwith, and it should come back happy.\n\n304\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.250\nNow, it did cite me not being\nin some of those groups.\n\n305\n00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.300\nNow I am in the Enterprise Admins group,\nand apparently it's not detecting that, so\n\n306\n00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.950\nI probably need to double-check that.\n\n307\n00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.110\nI need to make sure I'm\nlogged in as myself.\n\n308\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.800\nI am, I'm logged in as Don Pezet.\n\n309\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.830\nBut apparently it's not\nhappy with my permission.\n\n310\n00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.240\nSo I can jump over and double-check that.\n\n311\n00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.170\nI can reach out to a domain\ncontroller like this one,\n\n312\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.930\nwhich apparently just timed out on me.\n\n313\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.850\nAnd I can get into Active Directory Users\nand Computers, and\n\n314\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.690\nI can verify my permissions.\n\n315\n00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.570\nAll right, now once I'm in here,\n\n316\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.360\nI can find the Organization\nManagement Group, right there,\n\n317\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.910\nunder the active directory it's under the\nMicrosoft Exchange Security Groups, and\n\n318\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.780\nyou'll find Organization Management.\n\n319\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.120\nAnd I can add myself in there, and,\nwell, there I am, Don Pezet, all right?\n\n320\n00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.050\nSo that's odd.\n\n321\n00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:06.810\nWell, what I might be bumping into, is\nif you've changed your group membership,\n\n322\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:11.010\nbut you haven't logged out and logged back\nin, it might not be able to see that yet.\n\n323\n00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.710\nAnd that's probably\nwhat's going on with me.\n\n324\n00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:13.950\nSo I'm gonna go back here.\n\n325\n00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.880\nAnd it's not telling me to reboot or\nanything,\n\n326\n00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.800\nand I probably don't even need to reboot.\n\n327\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.190\nI should just be able to log out and log\nback in to refresh my group membership,\n\n328\n00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.220\nand that should take care of that.\n\n329\n00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.190\nSo I'll sign out, and\nthen I'll sign back in.\n\n330\n00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:30.040\nJust remember, any time you change\nGroup membership in Active Directory.\n\n331\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.850\nYou do need to log out and\nlog back in for them to take effect.\n\n332\n00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.550\nThat is more then likely my issue.\n\n333\n00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.270\nSo I'll do that, and\nI'll just relaunch the installer and\n\n334\n00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.310\nwe'll let it do it's check again.\n\n335\n00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:41.785\nSo, I'm just going to fire that back up.\n\n336\n00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.395\nI'm not going to connect to the Internet.\n\n337\n00:15:44.395 --> 00:15:45.945\nWe'll go a little faster this time.\n\n338\n00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.965\nThe cached file should already be there,\nso that should go quicker.\n\n339\n00:15:48.965 --> 00:15:50.225\nAnd then at this point we should pass.\n\n340\n00:15:50.225 --> 00:15:53.785\nWe've got our unified communications\ninstalled and we should be ready to rock.\n\n341\n00:15:53.785 --> 00:15:55.015\nAll right.\n\n342\n00:15:55.015 --> 00:15:57.825\nNow, I'm going to do\na mailbox server here.\n\n343\n00:15:57.825 --> 00:16:00.275\nI also want to do a client access server.\n\n344\n00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:02.470\nI can do the installs at the same time.\n\n345\n00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.220\nSo, I could jump over to another server,\nlike this one.\n\n346\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.700\nAnd if I want to get it set up, well,\nfirst off, I'm gonna log out and\n\n347\n00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.150\nlog back on just to be on\nthe safe side on this one.\n\n348\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.940\nBut I can start this\ninstall at the same time.\n\n349\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.210\nYou can be setting up more\nthan one Exchange Server.\n\n350\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.280\nYou don't have to wait for one to\nfinish before you can start the other.\n\n351\n00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.230\nSo I'm gonna start up\nthe install on this guy too, and\n\n352\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.990\nwe'll get them both up and running.\n\n353\n00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.860\nThe only difference is on this one I'm\ngonna choose Client Access Server instead\n\n354\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.900\nof Mailbox so\nthat I can get that set up on this one.\n\n355\n00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.650\nAnd I did already install\nthe Unified Communication Manager here so\n\n356\n00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:34.820\nI shouldn't have to worry about that.\n\n357\n00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.940\nAll right, so my Mailbox Server is just\ngonna churn along there and do its\n\n358\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.980\nreadiness checks and, sure enough, I'm\nseeing a little bit of a different screen.\n\n359\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.130\nNow, instead of a list of\nerrors that I need to correct,\n\n360\n00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.550\nI see Prerequisite analysis 100% install.\n\n361\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.170\nI'm good, I've cleared all my errors.\n\n362\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.640\nI can start the install.\n\n363\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.730\nNow, the installation takes a long time.\n\n364\n00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.600\nIt can take like an hour to run,\nso I'm gonna let that one churn.\n\n365\n00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.120\nI'm gonna move back over\nto my client access server.\n\n366\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.140\nThis is the one where I want to\ninstall a client access role, and\n\n367\n00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.030\nI'm gonna start it up also.\n\n368\n00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.720\nSo I'll go ahead and\nmove forward with that same installation.\n\n369\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.770\nIt's gonna do its pre-requisite check.\n\n370\n00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.300\nAnd then once it's done, it will be\nall clear and I can do my install.\n\n371\n00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.452\nSo I should see that just flip to 100% and\nbe done.\n\n372\n00:17:13.452 --> 00:17:18.310\nAll right, now I imagine, much like\nmyself, you guys probably don't wanna sit\n\n373\n00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.580\nhere and watch this little blue bar\nslowly creep across the screen.\n\n374\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:26.110\nSo, I'm gonna do a TV timeout and jump\nahead into the future after the install is\n\n375\n00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:29.490\ndone, and then we'll verify that Exchange\nis up and running and functional.\n\n376\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.010\nSo, let's take a break.\n\n377\n00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:31.990\nWe'll be right back after this.\n\n378\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.110\nAll right, so after about an hour\nof churning along on that install,\n\n379\n00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.030\nthe install is done.\n\n380\n00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.010\nThe system reboots, and\nnow we're up and running.\n\n381\n00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.670\nSo the last thing we need to do\nis to verify that Exchange is\n\n382\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.910\ninstalled and happy.\n\n383\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.090\nAnd there's really just two simple ways\nthat we can test this before we dive\n\n384\n00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.930\ninto any crazy configuration.\n\n385\n00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.180\nThe first thing,\nis to check the services on your computer.\n\n386\n00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.340\nWhen Exchange installed,\nwhether you pick client access or mailbox,\n\n387\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.900\nit installs different services,\nthey should be up and running.\n\n388\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.230\nSo I'm gonna take my server here, and I'll\njust jump under my Server Manager, and\n\n389\n00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.080\nI'll go to Tools and Services.\n\n390\n00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.260\nAnd in my Services screen, I should start\nto see some Microsoft Exchange services.\n\n391\n00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.820\nAnd so if I kinda drill down a bit here,\nwe'll find them in the list.\n\n392\n00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:18.040\nSo here I see the Active Directory\ntopology, diagnostics, IMAP 4 and POP 3.\n\n393\n00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.060\nThat's because this is\na client access server.\n\n394\n00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.880\nYour mailbox server won't have those.\n\n395\n00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.900\nAnd so I see each of those, there's that\nunified messaging connector and so on.\n\n396\n00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.690\nI start to see the different\nthings that were installed.\n\n397\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.750\nThere's front end transport,\nI mentioned those in another episode.\n\n398\n00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.680\nSo I see them, and I see that some of\nthem are running, some of them aren't.\n\n399\n00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.310\nI notice that IMAP 4 and\nPOP 3 are disabled by default.\n\n400\n00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.990\nThey're set to manually start, so\nI don't expect to see those running.\n\n401\n00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.670\nBut all these ones that say Automatic,\n\n402\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.840\nthose are the ones that we\nwanna see up and running.\n\n403\n00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.800\nAnd that let's us know that this server,\nat a minimum, at least,\n\n404\n00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.900\nthinks it's an Exchange Server.\n\n405\n00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.990\nHow do we know it's actually working?\n\n406\n00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.320\nWell, we can jump into\nour management console.\n\n407\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.240\nNow in previous versions of exchange\nwe had the actual exchange management\n\n408\n00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.750\nconsole, a software program that we ran,\nand it was nightmarishly slow, and\n\n409\n00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:02.770\nI always hated it.\n\n410\n00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:06.340\nWell, now we have our web interface for\nmanagement.\n\n411\n00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.590\nSo we can jump over to any\nclient in our network.\n\n412\n00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.280\nI'll take this Windows 7 machine, and\nwe can browse to our management console.\n\n413\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.900\nSo I'm gonna fire this up, I'm gonna\nignore my Windows updates there, and\n\n414\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.230\nI will browse to one of my servers.\n\n415\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.440\nNow, I need to browse to\na client access server.\n\n416\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.650\nThe management panel's actually not\ninstalled on a mailbox server, so\n\n417\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.940\nI can't just browse to that.\n\n418\n00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.110\nSo I'll browse to https:// and\nthen I'll pick a client access server.\n\n419\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.900\nAnd you know, now that I think about it,\n\n420\n00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.650\nI can't remember which one\nwas my client access server.\n\n421\n00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.520\nLet's see, it's server number two.\n\n422\n00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.440\nSo I'm gonna browse to server number two,\n/ecp.\n\n423\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.970\nAll right, now, in previous versions of\nExchange like Exchange 2010, ECP stood for\n\n424\n00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.690\nthe Exchange Control Panel.\n\n425\n00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.340\nAnd it used to be just for regular\nusers to be able to get in there and\n\n426\n00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.300\nmanage themselves, and then for\nadministrators you had some basic queue\n\n427\n00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.720\nmanagement you could do in there,\nand that was it.\n\n428\n00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.970\nIn Exchange 2013, the ECP is now\na full featured management suite for\n\n429\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.500\nthe entire Exchange environment.\n\n430\n00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.140\nIt replaces the old Exchange\nmanagement console.\n\n431\n00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.500\nSo we don't need that software anymore,\n\n432\n00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.100\nnow we just have a webpage\nthat we browse to.\n\n433\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.680\nNow, by default when you install it's\ngonna do a self signed certificate, so\n\n434\n00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.960\nexpect to get a certificate\nwarning like this.\n\n435\n00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.460\nWe can swap that certificate out later.\n\n436\n00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.260\nWe'll see that in another episode.\n\n437\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.610\nBut for right now I'm gonna\ncontinue onto the website,\n\n438\n00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:26.210\neven though it's not recommended, and it's\ngonna browse to it and give me the site.\n\n439\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.430\nNow, if I'm browsing to a mailbox server\n\n440\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:34.070\nI'll probably get some kind of 500\nerror or 404, saying page not found,\n\n441\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.510\nand that's because the mailbox server\ndoesn't have the exchange control panel.\n\n442\n00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.850\nBut when I go to a client access\nserver I should see this.\n\n443\n00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.450\nI'm in the Exchange Admin Center, and\nI can log in with my admin account.\n\n444\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.700\nSo I'm gonna log in with that.\n\n445\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.500\nAnd in the example here,\nit gives you domain/username.\n\n446\n00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.160\nThat's the old net bios name.\n\n447\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.220\nYou can user the newer, fully qualified\ndomain name format if you want it,\n\n448\n00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.380\nit's up to you.\n\n449\n00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.780\nAnd I can get logged in.\n\n450\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.050\nNow, just the fact that I even saw this\nscreen is letting me know that my client\n\n451\n00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.180\naccess server's web interface is working.\n\n452\n00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.930\nSo I've already verified part of it.\n\n453\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.930\nBut what I really want to do is get in and\nsee my organization, and\n\n454\n00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.430\nsee the servers inside\nof that organization.\n\n455\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.230\nSo, when I get logged in here, it's going\nto start to show here's some recipients,\n\n456\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.000\nI've got one mailbox for me.\n\n457\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.780\nI get a mailbox, it's exciting.\n\n458\n00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.470\nAnd I can start to work with my groups and\nresources, and so on.\n\n459\n00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.780\nSo I start to see that.\n\n460\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.730\nBut over here on the left,\n\n461\n00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.110\nwhat I really want to see is\nright down here under servers.\n\n462\n00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.860\nI can jump down to servers, and I'll see\nall the servers in my organization and\n\n463\n00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.940\nI expect to see Lab Exchange server 01 and\n02.\n\n464\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.780\nThere's my mailbox and\nclient access servers that I brought up.\n\n465\n00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.640\nIf I was running both roles on\nthe same server it would say mailbox,\n\n466\n00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.560\nclient access server, you have both.\n\n467\n00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.960\nBut in this case I see my separate server,\nso they're up and running.\n\n468\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.180\nAnd from here I can go and verify other\nthings like the databases, right?\n\n469\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.360\nSo here's my Mailbox Database\non Exchange Server 01.\n\n470\n00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.910\nWe could also look at other\nthings like Virtual Directories,\n\n471\n00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.420\nwhich will be things\nlike the Outlook Web App.\n\n472\n00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.390\nSo I can find those in here, or\nthe Exchange control panel, and\n\n473\n00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:06.570\nsee how the Exchange control panel is\nrunning on server 02, not server 01.\n\n474\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.600\nRight, the mailbox database is\nnot included in any of those.\n\n475\n00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.930\nSo right here I can verify that,\nlooking at the active directory,\n\n476\n00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.794\nlooking at the servers,\n\n477\n00:22:13.794 --> 00:22:17.650\nI'm seeing all the information,\nmy Exchange organization is up.\n\n478\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.050\nNow it's up to me to go and\nconfigure it and\n\n479\n00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.870\ncustomize it to meet\nthe needs of my organization.\n\n480\n00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.980\nAnd that's where things start\nto get different, right?\n\n481\n00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.510\nThe installed steps that I just did,\neverybody's gonna do those.\n\n482\n00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.360\nBut what you configure from here on out,\nis gonna be based on\n\n483\n00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.260\na series of decisions built around\nyour company, and what your needs are.\n\n484\n00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.100\nSo things do start to get\na little bit different.\n\n485\n00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.550\nBut from right here we can start to\nsee that basic view of our system,\n\n486\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.817\nwhat we're gonna be working with, how we\nmake sure that we are up and running and\n\n487\n00:22:43.817 --> 00:22:47.530\nhappy, and that we've now got Exchange\ninstalled and we're ready to work with it.\n\n488\n00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.800\nNow if you've worked with Office 365 or\n\n489\n00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.950\nAzure Hosted Exchange,\nthis might look familiar.\n\n490\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.340\nBecause this is the same management\ntool that you use in Azure.\n\n491\n00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.680\nSo if you learn how to\ndo this in Exchange,\n\n492\n00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.510\nyou know how to do it in Azure also.\n\n493\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.990\nOr Office 365.\nOr if you learned it in Office 365,\n\n494\n00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.170\nyou know how to do it here.\n\n495\n00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.990\nMicrosoft made it the same to make it easy\nto transition from one to the other, or\n\n496\n00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.410\nrun both in tandem.\n\n497\n00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:09.710\nYou can have them connected.\n\n498\n00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.180\nIt's really neat to have those\nsolutions that are out there.\n\n499\n00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.530\nBut at this point,\nExchange is installed, it's up,\n\n500\n00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.220\nit's running, now we got an email server.\n\n501\n00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.690\nDone that easy.\n\n502\n00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.950\nNow, I do wanna remind you that\nit happened pretty fast here, but\n\n503\n00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.840\nin real-life land, I'm not joking when I\nsay that install can take about an hour.\n\n504\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.730\nIt takes a long time to get all\nthe different things set up,\n\n505\n00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.840\nto provision the database space,\nand all that.\n\n506\n00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.340\nIt takes a while.\n\n507\n00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.370\nThe better your hardware,\nthe faster it'll happen.\n\n508\n00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:40.270\nBut I'm on a quad-core Intel\ni7 with a SSD storage here,\n\n509\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.810\nand it takes my system about an hour.\n\n510\n00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:43.980\nSo, it does take a long\ntime to do the install.\n\n511\n00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.622\nJust be prepared for that, and\ndon't be surprised when that happens.\n\n512\n00:23:46.622 --> 00:23:52.030\nAll right, well, in this episode we got\na chance to see installing Exchange,\n\n513\n00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.390\nwe did a client access server and\na mailbox server.\n\n514\n00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.860\nWe didn't do edge transport,\n\n515\n00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.540\nI'm gonna cover that in\na special episode down the road.\n\n516\n00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.670\nBut we gotta chance to see how to get\nour organization up and running, and\n\n517\n00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.090\nget a fully featured exchange\norganization in place.\n\n518\n00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.160\nDefinitely stay tuned, though.\n\n519\n00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.720\nOn all of our other episodes,\nwe're gonna see how we can tweak this and\n\n520\n00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.800\ncustomize it and\nreally get it to work for us.\n\n521\n00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.090\nBut as far as getting a basic\ninstall done, that's it.\n\n522\n00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.360\nAll right, well, this is a pretty\ngood spot for us to wrap this one up.\n\n523\n00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.780\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n524\n00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.387\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet,\nand I'll see you next time.\n\n525\n00:24:21.387 --> 00:24:27.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.111\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:20.410\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Exchange 2013.\n\n5\n00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.390\nToday's episode is pretty important,\nbecause we're going to be taking a look\n\n6\n00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.680\nat the mailbox database role,\nor the mailbox role.\n\n7\n00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.090\nWhen we set up Exchange, one of the key\nfunctions of it is to be an email server,\n\n8\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.550\nand we've got to store\nthat email somewhere.\n\n9\n00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.340\nSo one of the critical roles we have in\nExchange 2013, is called the mail box\n\n10\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.130\nserver role, and that's the server\nthat holds all your email.\n\n11\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.000\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n12\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.800\nWe're gonna see where the email get\nstored, how it kind of moves around, and\n\n13\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.355\nsome of the considerations we have\nto have with that information.\n\n14\n00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:49.985\nNow I got on my machine right here,\n\n15\n00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:52.895\njust a base install exchange,\nI haven't tweaked it much.\n\n16\n00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:53.995\nI have two servers.\n\n17\n00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:58.805\nI've got a mail box server, and\nI've got a Client Access Server,\n\n18\n00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.295\nso two separate systems.\n\n19\n00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:02.235\nYou could run them together if you wanted.\n\n20\n00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:05.600\nI've chosen to run them separate,\nand we normally do that for scale.\n\n21\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.640\nBut when you bring up your\nfirst mailbox server,\n\n22\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.900\none of the things it does is\nit creates a mailbox database.\n\n23\n00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.630\nAnd if you're a small organization,\n\n24\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.350\nthen default mailbox database\nmight be fine for you.\n\n25\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.390\nBut most people are gonna find\nthat they do have to tweak it and\n\n26\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.980\nchange it a little bit.\n\n27\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.420\nNow if I browse here,\nI'm in my Exchange admin center, and\n\n28\n00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.980\nI'm just gonna go down to Servers, and\nI'll see my servers that are right here.\n\n29\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.730\nAnd you can see that Lab Exchange Server\n1 is my mailbox server, and\n\n30\n00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.130\nthen I've got a client access one, also.\n\n31\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.850\nWell, if I go over here to Databases,\n\n32\n00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.840\nI'm gonna see a list of\nthe mailbox databases that I have.\n\n33\n00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.040\nAnd I've got this one right here.\n\n34\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.975\nIt's got a nice, easy to remember name.\n\n35\n00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:44.120\n[LAUGH] If you go with the default.\n\n36\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.800\nYou're going to have a name like this.\n\n37\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.370\nMailbox Database 2013076320, right?\n\n38\n00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.330\nIt probably won't match that, right?\n\n39\n00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.060\nBut it'll be something similar.\n\n40\n00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.250\nThis is the default mailbox database.\n\n41\n00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.680\nIf you create your own mailbox database,\nyou can call it whatever you want, but\n\n42\n00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.900\nthe default gets this name.\n\n43\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.140\nNow, why the weird name?\n\n44\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.080\nWell, what we'll see in some later\nepisodes is that if you wanna do high\n\n45\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.930\navailability, if you wanna maintain\nmultiple copies of that database for\n\n46\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.350\nredundancy sake,\n\n47\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.500\nyour mailbox database has to have\na unique name across your entire forest.\n\n48\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.100\nAnd so that's why it sticks all\nthese numbers at the end of it.\n\n49\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.680\nThat's why it's not just mailbox database,\n\n50\n00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.400\nit's Mailbox database 2013076320\nto try and create that uniqueness.\n\n51\n00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.240\nAll right.\nSo\n\n52\n00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.280\nexpect to see a kind of\na weird name like that.\n\n53\n00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.220\nBut that's why it has that name.\n\n54\n00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.640\nNow this just looks like\na single entry right here.\n\n55\n00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.530\nI see I've got a mailbox database.\n\n56\n00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.290\nAnd if I click on it,\nI can see some basic information.\n\n57\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.620\nI can see the servers\nthat it's running on.\n\n58\n00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.270\nAnd notice that I can\nhave more than one copy.\n\n59\n00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.890\nBy default your mailbox data base runs\non one server and your users, you'll\n\n60\n00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.240\ncreate mailboxes for them, and they'll\nbe in this mailbox data base right here.\n\n61\n00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.920\nIt's the default.\n\n62\n00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.150\nWell, what happens if this mail\nbox data base goes offline?\n\n63\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.550\nWe cant get to our email, right?\n\n64\n00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.620\nWe're not necessarily losing email,\nbecause remember email comes in\n\n65\n00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.360\nthrough your client access servers, so\nthe email comes in there and gets stuck.\n\n66\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.940\nIt kind of gets stuck while it waits\nto make it to your mailbox server.\n\n67\n00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.040\nIf your hub transport role is at least\nrunning, it will at least get to that.\n\n68\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.730\nI shouldn't say role,\nit isn't a role anymore.\n\n69\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.210\nYour hub transport service.\n\n70\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.680\nIf that's running,\nit'll actually get queued there and\n\n71\n00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.730\nwait even if your\nMailbox Database is offline.\n\n72\n00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.980\nBut if your entire\ninfrastructure is offline,\n\n73\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.160\nthen you do kinda start to\nlose email at that point.\n\n74\n00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.225\nBut here, I can see my Mailbox Database Is\nup, incoming email can flow into it.\n\n75\n00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:33.035\nMy users can check their email,\nand they can access it, right.\n\n76\n00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:36.965\nI know it's up and healthy because I\nsee right here, status mounted, right?\n\n77\n00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:39.875\nThat status of mounted, you're\nusually gonna see one of two things,\n\n78\n00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.195\nmounted or unmounted.\n\n79\n00:03:41.195 --> 00:03:45.110\nMounted means it's online,\nit's active and you can look inside it.\n\n80\n00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.440\nUnmounted means the files exist, but\nyou can't access them right now.\n\n81\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.350\nIt's kind of like the data\nbase is turned off.\n\n82\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.410\nWe might unmount the data\nbase to do maintenance on it,\n\n83\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.800\nand we'll talk about that a little\nbit later in the episode, but for\n\n84\n00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.950\nthe most part we expect to see it's\nmounted and up and running, all right?\n\n85\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.280\nNow, I don't have any\ncopies of this data base.\n\n86\n00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.480\nI just have my one copy.\n\n87\n00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.310\nIf I had more than one,\n\n88\n00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.230\nI'd see more than one server name right\nhere, letting me know I had a copy.\n\n89\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.480\nWe're talk about availability\nmore in other episodes, but\n\n90\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.060\njust to mention it here real quick.\n\n91\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.540\nThere's two great ways to make your\ndatabases redundant in Exchange.\n\n92\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.430\nOne way is do a database copy, right?\n\n93\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.340\nA database copy is basically\na full clone of your\n\n94\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.110\nmailbox database that's\nstored on a separate server.\n\n95\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.230\nThe cool thing about that is the server,\nit could be right next to the server,\n\n96\n00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.890\nit could be in another building, it could\nbe in another city, it could be in another\n\n97\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.420\ncountry, but it's an identical\ncopy of your mailbox database.\n\n98\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.730\nSo if this mailbox database server fails,\nI can redirect everybody to the other one,\n\n99\n00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.220\nand they'll have access\nto their information.\n\n100\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.830\nAnd that redirect can\nhappen automatically.\n\n101\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.550\nThe end users might not even notice that.\n\n102\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.590\nIf they're using like the Outlook client,\nit'll fail over and jump right over to\n\n103\n00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.260\nthe other system, and in business,\nthey don't even know the failure happened.\n\n104\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.330\nIt might be a little slower, depending\nhow far away that other server is, but\n\n105\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.920\notherwise it's seamless to them.\n\n106\n00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.700\nSo, that's a really cool\nway to handle that, and\n\n107\n00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.720\nthat's just called a database copy.\n\n108\n00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.980\nThere is another option.\n\n109\n00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.020\nYou'll see up here,\ndatabase availability groups.\n\n110\n00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.840\nA database availability group,\nIs where we take the mailbox database, and\n\n111\n00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.710\nwe store it on a Microsoft Windows\nfailover cluster.\n\n112\n00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.810\nIf you have a failover cluster set up,\nmultiple servers with shared storage,\n\n113\n00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.720\nyour database can be part\nof that shared storage, and\n\n114\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.230\nit can flip between\nmultiple physical systems.\n\n115\n00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.140\nThat gives you a lot of redundancy,\nbut it requires a lot of hardware.\n\n116\n00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.800\nIf you're in an Enterprise environment\nyou've probably got the hardware for\n\n117\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.370\nthat or at least the budget for\nthat and you can do it.\n\n118\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.050\nBut if you're in a small or medium\nbusiness, clusters get to be expensive, so\n\n119\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.790\nyou might not have that\ninfrastructure in place, or\n\n120\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.160\nyou might not just want to\ndeal with the complexity.\n\n121\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.300\nAnd those database\ncopies are a lot easier.\n\n122\n00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.330\nSo those are two solutions for\nmaking it redundant, and\n\n123\n00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.580\nthat's what we kind of see\nhere when we look at these.\n\n124\n00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.830\nI can see I've got a bad\ncopy count of zero.\n\n125\n00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.470\nI don't have any copies, so\nnone of them can be bad.\n\n126\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.770\nI'll have a zero there.\n\n127\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.490\nAll right.\n\n128\n00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.270\nNow, I didn't make this mailbox database.\n\n129\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.800\nExchange made it for me.\n\n130\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.430\nBut I can make my own if I want.\n\n131\n00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.660\nYou got a little plus sign up here.\n\n132\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.740\nYou can hit it and you can start\nto create more mailbox databases.\n\n133\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.870\nNow why would I want to have\nmore than one mailbox database?\n\n134\n00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.560\nThe reason is, we can actually put some\ndifferent settings on there that dictate\n\n135\n00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.580\nrestrictions, limits, behaviors that apply\nto users in one database versus another.\n\n136\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.100\nWhen you create a new user mailbox,\nyou can pick the database that it goes to.\n\n137\n00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.440\nSo I might have one database setup for\nmy executives, and\n\n138\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.370\nthe executives are allowed to have\nmailboxes with unlimited size.\n\n139\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.490\nThey can have as much emails as they want.\n\n140\n00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.920\nBut I have another mailbox that I use for\nmy contractors, and\n\n141\n00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.810\nI hold my contractors to 1 gig\nof mail in each mailbox right.\n\n142\n00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.020\nI have a limit on them.\n\n143\n00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.400\nSo we can impose these pretty easily,\nthrough mailbox databases.\n\n144\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.820\nI might also do this for\nperformance issues.\n\n145\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.831\nI might want to split my\nmailboxes up 50/50, so\n\n146\n00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:48.790\nthat some are 1 ray to ray and\nthe others are on another ray to ray.\n\n147\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.640\nIt's all one physical server.\n\n148\n00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.050\nBut I have multiple that I'm bouncing\nacross to help eliminate disk contention.\n\n149\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.120\nThese mailbox databases,\nthey're databases.\n\n150\n00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.160\nYou do a lot of reads off of there and\nyou do get disk contention, where multiple\n\n151\n00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.210\nusers are trying to access data at\nthe same time, and they have to queue up.\n\n152\n00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.460\nThey have to form a line.\n\n153\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.460\nSo you might have to\nwait to get to your data,\n\n154\n00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.360\nwhile somebody is getting their data\nfirst, and we don't want that to happen.\n\n155\n00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.540\nDividing our mailbox databases\nup can help with that.\n\n156\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.000\nNow, in the standard\nversion of Exchange 2013,\n\n157\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.990\nI can create up to five\nmailbox databases per server.\n\n158\n00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.840\nIf I need more than five,\nI've got to go to the Enterprise edition.\n\n159\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.090\nWith service pack one,\n\n160\n00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.370\nyou can have up to 100 mailbox\ndatabases on the Enterprise edition.\n\n161\n00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.250\nBut I'm gonna create one.\n\n162\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.100\nMaybe I want to separate\nall my salespeople.\n\n163\n00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.210\nI want my salespeople to be in a separate\nmailbox database for various reasons.\n\n164\n00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.020\nSo I'm gonna create a database\nhere called Sales, and\n\n165\n00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.950\nI can choose what server it resides on.\n\n166\n00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.990\nNow, I've only got one mailbox server,\nso it's not a big deal for me.\n\n167\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.590\nBut if I had more than one mailbox server,\nI could browse.\n\n168\n00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.610\nAnd pick the one where\nit's gonna reside on.\n\n169\n00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.560\nI'll just pick the one that I've got.\n\n170\n00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.840\nAll right.\n\n171\n00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.980\nAnd then we've got our database path.\n\n172\n00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.084\nThis is where the database files\nare actually gonna be stored.\n\n173\n00:07:59.084 --> 00:08:00.822\nAnd it's telling me about two things.\n\n174\n00:08:00.822 --> 00:08:04.574\nThis first one is the database itself,\nand so\n\n175\n00:08:04.574 --> 00:08:09.412\nI'll see this long path here\nthat it's laying out for me,\n\n176\n00:08:09.412 --> 00:08:13.083\nand at the very end, I'll see Sales.edb.\n\n177\n00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:15.486\nThat edb, that stands for\nExchange Database,\n\n178\n00:08:15.486 --> 00:08:17.950\nthat's the mailbox database file.\n\n179\n00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.380\nSo, if I were to browse on\nthe hard drive and find that file,\n\n180\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.499\nthat's where my email is\nactually being stored.\n\n181\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.960\nThen it has a log folder path and\nif I look at the end of that one.\n\n182\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.060\nIf I kinda scroll over it doesn't\nhave a file name at all and\n\n183\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.420\nthat's because what it's referring\nto are called transaction logs.\n\n184\n00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.755\nAnd you're not gonna\nhave 1 transaction log,\n\n185\n00:08:38.755 --> 00:08:42.781\nyou're gonna have many transaction logs,\nat a minimum you're gonna have 11.\n\n186\n00:08:42.781 --> 00:08:45.941\nYou'll probably have 100, 1,000.\n\n187\n00:08:45.941 --> 00:08:48.247\nYou can have a ton of\ntransaction log files, and\n\n188\n00:08:48.247 --> 00:08:50.940\nI'll explain what those\ndo here in a few minutes.\n\n189\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.580\nBut that's why it's just a path,\nit doesn't let us pick the file name.\n\n190\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.640\nIt's just saying this is the folder where\nwe're gonna store those transaction logs.\n\n191\n00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.700\nAnd then I've got the option\nto mount the database,\n\n192\n00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.940\nwhich is what's actually\ngonna bring it online.\n\n193\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.650\nSo when I hit Save,\nIt's gonna create that sales database and\n\n194\n00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.370\nit's gonna bring it online.\n\n195\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.570\nNow, it's empty, it doesn't have any\nmailboxes in there, but from now on,\n\n196\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:15.870\nwhen I create mailboxes, I can choose to\nput them in the sales mailbox database or\n\n197\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.110\nI could take existing mailboxes and\nI can move them.\n\n198\n00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.780\nYou can do a mailbox move request, and\nthat'll move the mailboxes over to this\n\n199\n00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.900\none, so I can move them back and forth,\nand you can do it while people are online.\n\n200\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.100\nIt's actually pretty slick.\n\n201\n00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.750\nWhen you move a mailbox,\nit's copying their mailbox, but\n\n202\n00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.380\nleaving the original, and it gets them\nboth in full synchronization, and\n\n203\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.815\nthen it just removes the old one.\n\n204\n00:09:36.815 --> 00:09:41.150\nSo you've got a full copy of the mailbox\nat all times, and the Outlook client,\n\n205\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.870\nOutlook Web access, all the various\nother ways of getting into your mail,\n\n206\n00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.300\nare aware of that and\nwill jump to the other server.\n\n207\n00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.020\nThe end users don't even\nknow that that happens.\n\n208\n00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.870\nIt's pretty neat stuff.\n\n209\n00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.010\nAll right, so I just added the mailbox\ndatabase, and you'll see I got a little\n\n210\n00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.050\nwarning here that says I need to restart\nthe Microsoft Exchange Information Store\n\n211\n00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.040\nservice on that server after\nadding a new mailbox database so\n\n212\n00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.160\nthat it can recognize it.\n\n213\n00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.810\nI'm gonna go ahead and say okay to that.\n\n214\n00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.230\nSo I've got my database, it's up and\nit's showing as mounted.\n\n215\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.640\nNow how is it mounted, but it told\nme I needed to restart the service?\n\n216\n00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.980\nWhy do I need to restart the service?\n\n217\n00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.651\nWell it's actually mounted,\nit's online and it's working right now.\n\n218\n00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:21.469\nI don't have to restart the service,\nbut there's certain things like\n\n219\n00:10:21.469 --> 00:10:25.923\ndatabase indexes that get build when you\nrestart the service, and so at my earliest\n\n220\n00:10:25.923 --> 00:10:29.631\nconvenience I need to go and\nrestart that service when I get a chance.\n\n221\n00:10:29.631 --> 00:10:34.216\nNow if I restart that service every\nmailbox database that's on that\n\n222\n00:10:34.216 --> 00:10:38.239\nserver is going to get unmounted and\nthen re-mounted, and\n\n223\n00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:41.391\nthat's gonna cause a service interruption.\n\n224\n00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.591\nIf I have copies of the database or\nif I'm in a database availability group,\n\n225\n00:10:44.591 --> 00:10:47.041\nit's no big deal, but\nif I've only got one copy like I do,\n\n226\n00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:48.991\nthat is gonna create\na service interruption.\n\n227\n00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:53.057\nSo I don't wanna do it right now if users\nare in the system, I wanna wait and\n\n228\n00:10:53.057 --> 00:10:55.560\ndo it later when users\naren't in the system.\n\n229\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.620\nAll right, but now I've got my\ndifferent mailbox databases.\n\n230\n00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.920\nNow I have to be careful,\nbecause my mailbox database,\n\n231\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.640\nI didn't give it a crazy\nname like the default.\n\n232\n00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.910\nThe default has those extra numbers\nattached to the end of it to make it\n\n233\n00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.170\nunique, mine doesn't.\n\n234\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.740\nSo if I'm gonna be doing\ndatabase copies and\n\n235\n00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.630\ndatabase availability groups,\nI need to make sure from now on,\n\n236\n00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.360\non all of my mailbox servers,\nI don't use the name Sales again.\n\n237\n00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.270\nSo we want it to be a little bit specific\nwith that name and make sure that we don't\n\n238\n00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.379\nget duplicates, and\nthat's throughout the whole organization.\n\n239\n00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.450\nOnce I've got a mailbox database created,\n\n240\n00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.920\nit's actually built several\nfiles to store that database in.\n\n241\n00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.440\nLet's take a look at those files.\n\n242\n00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.530\nI'm gonna switch over to that server,\nwhich is that guy right here,\n\n243\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.960\nand i'm just gonna browse\non the hard drive, and\n\n244\n00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.530\nwe'll browse into where all\nthose files are stored.\n\n245\n00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:50.950\nThey're buried away in\nC:/programfiles/Microsoft/exchangeserver/-\n\n246\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:56.000\nversion15, that's Exchange 2013, /mailbox.\n\n247\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.560\nIn there you're going to see folders for\nyour mailbox databases.\n\n248\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.630\nSo I can see mailbox database 2013076320,\nrolls right off the tongue,\n\n249\n00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.625\nand I'll see the database sales.\n\n250\n00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:11.100\nSo I see those databases right there,\nand if I browse into it,\n\n251\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.920\nlike I'll take my sales database,\nI see a lot of files.\n\n252\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.730\nAll of these files are important.\n\n253\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.830\nIf you delete one of these\nfiles you will regret it.?\n\n254\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.880\n[LAUGH] All of these are important files.\n\n255\n00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.540\nThey each serve a purpose.\n\n256\n00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.450\nThe most important one is this\nguy right here, Sales.edb.\n\n257\n00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.820\nThat's my Exchange database,\nthat's really important to me.\n\n258\n00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:35.170\nI don't have any mailboxes in here, but\nnotice that it's already 253 megs in size.\n\n259\n00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.527\nThat's because it's got some\ndefault information and\n\n260\n00:12:37.527 --> 00:12:41.390\nsome basic size applied to it, some empty\nspace so that it doesn't have to grow.\n\n261\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.370\nAs I throw more and\n\n262\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.020\nmore data in there, it'll grow to reflect\nthe amount of data that's in there.\n\n263\n00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.260\nSome of the other files\nthat are important,\n\n264\n00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.370\nremember those log files that I mentioned?\n\n265\n00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:57.160\nWell, we can see one of them right here,\nE01.log, And\n\n266\n00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.680\nI'm not seeing my file extensions.\n\n267\n00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.425\nLet me turn on my file extensions,\nthere we go.\n\n268\n00:13:00.425 --> 00:13:04.980\nE01.log, that is what's\ncalled a transaction log.\n\n269\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.800\nNow let me explain transaction logs\nreally quickly, it's important and\n\n270\n00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.320\nyou need to know it for the exam, but\nyou need to know it for real life too.\n\n271\n00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:16.070\nWhen you get a new email, that email comes\nin and it needs to go to the database, so\n\n272\n00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.020\nwe gotta write the data to the database.\n\n273\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.840\nWell, let's say the email has an\nattachment and it's 1 meg in size, and so\n\n274\n00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.260\nit starts to write that one meg\nattachment into the database.\n\n275\n00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.700\nIt gets halfway through and\nyou lose power.\n\n276\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.020\nPower goes out, the server shuts down.\n\n277\n00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.630\nWell, power comes back,\nyou boot the server up.\n\n278\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.992\nWhat happened?\nWell,\n\n279\n00:13:35.992 --> 00:13:40.820\nonly half of that attachment was written\nto the database, so it's now corrupted.\n\n280\n00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.270\nYou've got corrupt data in your database,\nso\n\n281\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.700\nnow when someone goes to access that\nattachment, they get a corrupt file.\n\n282\n00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.900\nIt's damaged, and worse,\n\n283\n00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.470\nthe file might be damaged in a way\nthat Exchange can't even access it.\n\n284\n00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.950\nNow you've got dead data filling up your\ndatabase, and it just sits there, and\n\n285\n00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.630\nyou can't do anything about it.\n\n286\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.880\nThat would be bad.\n\n287\n00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.980\nSo transaction logs are designed\nto help insulate us from that.\n\n288\n00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.780\nThe way transactions logs work is\nwhen data comes in to be written to\n\n289\n00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.810\nthe database,\n\n290\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.170\nyou don't write to the database,\nyou write to the transaction logs.\n\n291\n00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.410\nSo that one meg attachment gets to written\nto a transaction log file first, and\n\n292\n00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.970\nonly when the data is 100%\nwritten to the transaction log,\n\n293\n00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.450\nis it then written to the actual database.\n\n294\n00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.360\nAnd the reason it does it that way is,\nnow when it's writing to the database,\n\n295\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.770\nlet's say it's halfway through and\nthe power goes out?\n\n296\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.370\nWell, when you boot that\nserver back up it says, oh,\n\n297\n00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.900\nI was halfway through, when we look at the\ntransactional file, there's all the data.\n\n298\n00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.690\nLet me just start it over again, and\nit copies it back in, it does a rollback.\n\n299\n00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:38.000\nIt undoes the partial write, and then\na roll forward to reapply that data in and\n\n300\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.290\nyou get it back in the database.\n\n301\n00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.430\nAnd so it ensures that things like\npower outages or unexpected database\n\n302\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.870\ndismounts or whatever don't result\nin corrupted data in the database.\n\n303\n00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.440\nNow, transaction logs only affect writes,\nwhen we write data.\n\n304\n00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.660\nWhen you read data,\nyou read it right out of the database,\n\n305\n00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.160\ncuz you're not gonna corrupt\nthe database by reading it.\n\n306\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.630\nThose happen right out of the EDB file,\nbut\n\n307\n00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.920\nwhen you're doing a write operation, your\nwrites always go to the transactions logs.\n\n308\n00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:10.260\nNow, the transaction log file, on mine you\ncan see this E01.log, it's just one file.\n\n309\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.681\nIt won't be one file for long.\n\n310\n00:15:11.681 --> 00:15:14.601\nNotice that the file is 1 meg in size,\nright?\n\n311\n00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:15.961\n1,024 kilobytes.\n\n312\n00:15:15.961 --> 00:15:20.961\nWell, it's one meg, what if I have\nmore than one meg of changes?\n\n313\n00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:25.223\nIf I have more than one meg of changes\nit's going to create a second file, E02,\n\n314\n00:15:25.223 --> 00:15:28.044\nE03 and so on, and\nwhat it's actually gonna do is,\n\n315\n00:15:28.044 --> 00:15:30.761\nyou'll see it's already\ndone it right down here.\n\n316\n00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:36.253\nE01, 0000001 and then E01 00000002\n\n317\n00:15:36.253 --> 00:15:40.320\nIt's created two log files right here.\n\n318\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.270\nSo the first one filled up,\nI had one meg of changes here, and so\n\n319\n00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.000\nthen it created a second file.\n\n320\n00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000\nNow, what is that E01?\n\n321\n00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.550\nE01 just means that this is\nthe second database on my server.\n\n322\n00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.126\nRemember, I already had a database server,\nI mean a database.\n\n323\n00:15:55.126 --> 00:15:57.293\nI had the mailbox database.\n\n324\n00:15:57.293 --> 00:15:59.084\nLet me just jump back to it here.\n\n325\n00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:02.292\nThis guy right here, this was my\nfirst database, mailbox database.\n\n326\n00:16:02.292 --> 00:16:04.752\nSo sales is technically my second one.\n\n327\n00:16:04.752 --> 00:16:09.981\nThe mailbox database, this guy,\nwas E00, this one is E01.\n\n328\n00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:13.602\nSo inside of sales, that's why\neverything starts with E01, right?\n\n329\n00:16:13.602 --> 00:16:17.563\nSo if I were to put all of these\ndatabases in the same folder,\n\n330\n00:16:17.563 --> 00:16:23.842\nthey'd be able to tell each other apart,\nbecause E00, E01, E02, and so on, right?\n\n331\n00:16:23.842 --> 00:16:28.604\nIf I go backup a folder here, and\ngo into that mailbox database 2013 folder,\n\n332\n00:16:28.604 --> 00:16:30.645\nsee how they all start with E00?\n\n333\n00:16:30.645 --> 00:16:32.990\nIt was the first database, right?\n\n334\n00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.159\nAnd, it's the first, but they start\nnumbering with 0, it's computers,\n\n335\n00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:38.132\nthey're annoying, so\n[LAUGH] we've got that.\n\n336\n00:16:38.132 --> 00:16:42.820\nAll right, but here inside of our\nsales database, We've got E01.log.\n\n337\n00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.170\nThat's defining what our\ntransaction log list is, right?\n\n338\n00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.490\nHow many logs we have.\n\n339\n00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:51.960\nAnd then down here, I can see E01\nall the way through 1, and then 2.\n\n340\n00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.250\nAnd it's just gonna keep counting up,\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and higher.\n\n341\n00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.860\nAnd it actually does hexadecimal.\n\n342\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.480\nSo it'll do 0 through 9, and then\nA through F, and then start over again,\n\n343\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.910\n0 through 9, A through F.\n\n344\n00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.180\nAnd so you can have tens of thousands,\n\n345\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.100\nhundreds of thousands of\ntransaction log files.\n\n346\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.290\nAs you're writing data to that database,\nthose are gonna grow and grow and\n\n347\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.650\ngrow, and they're always 1 meg in size.\n\n348\n00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:16.350\nIt breaks up into 1 megabyte chunks,\nall right.\n\n349\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:21.265\nNow, when you write to a transaction log,\nwhen your data is 100%\n\n350\n00:17:21.265 --> 00:17:24.505\nwritten to the transaction log,\nit's ready to be written to the database.\n\n351\n00:17:24.505 --> 00:17:26.575\nSo then it writes it to the database.\n\n352\n00:17:26.575 --> 00:17:29.835\nHow does it know what data's\nbeen written to the database and\n\n353\n00:17:29.835 --> 00:17:32.095\nwhat data's still in the transaction logs?\n\n354\n00:17:32.095 --> 00:17:33.790\nWell, it doesn't.\n\n355\n00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.740\nIt doesn't know.\n\n356\n00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.340\nSo it has to keep track of that somehow,\nand it has a separate file for that.\n\n357\n00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.520\nYou'll notice up here,\nI've got a filed called ES1.chk.\n\n358\n00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.540\nThat's my checkpoint file.\n\n359\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.930\nThe checkpoint is defining points in\ntime when everything was in sync,\n\n360\n00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.570\nwhen everything in the transaction\nlog was written to the database.\n\n361\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.490\nAnd so we can use that\ncheckpoint file to figure out\n\n362\n00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.120\nwhat was written to the database and\nwhat wasn't.\n\n363\n00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.360\nSo when there's a power outage,\nwe can boot our system back up,\n\n364\n00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.150\nit looks at the checkpoint, and says okay,\nwhat was written 100% and what wasn't?\n\n365\n00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.490\nAnything that wasn't written 100%, let's\nroll that back, let's undo that, okay?\n\n366\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.220\nAnd then everything that was written\n100% is done, it's fine, and\n\n367\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.850\nnow we start rolling forward any other\ntransactions that are still in tact,\n\n368\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.800\nanything that we actually have\nthe full set of data for and\n\n369\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.490\nit will start reapplying them, and\nit does all this automatically.\n\n370\n00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.110\nWe don't have to worry about it.\n\n371\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.430\nWell, there is actually one little\nbit we have to worry about.\n\n372\n00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.170\nAs you make changes, the changes\nare being written to the log files,\n\n373\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.150\nand then they're being\nwritten to the database.\n\n374\n00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.230\nThat means you're using double storage.\n\n375\n00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.386\nIf you get a five meg attachment,\n\n376\n00:18:37.386 --> 00:18:39.453\nthe attachment is written to\nthe transaction log file, and\n\n377\n00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:42.452\nthen it's written to the database, too,\nnow it's a 10 mega attachment, right?\n\n378\n00:18:42.452 --> 00:18:43.920\nIt took twice the space.\n\n379\n00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.040\nSo these transaction logs,\nthey grow and they grow and they grow.\n\n380\n00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.670\nEventually, you need to flush them out.\n\n381\n00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.615\nYou flush the transaction logs, and\nthe way you do it is by running a backup.\n\n382\n00:18:52.615 --> 00:18:53.210\nWhen you run a backup,\n\n383\n00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:58.740\nwhen you run a full backup of an exchange\nserver, it flushes the transaction logs.\n\n384\n00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.440\nOr if you run a differential backup,\nit flushes the transaction logs.\n\n385\n00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.590\nI'm sorry, not differential,\nlet me try to get this straight.\n\n386\n00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.870\nI wanna make sure you guys\nhave the right information.\n\n387\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.750\nIf you run an incremental backup,\nit flushes the transaction logs.\n\n388\n00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.080\nIf you run a differential,\nit leaves the transaction logs,\n\n389\n00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.950\nbecause each differential contains all\nthe changes since the last full backup,\n\n390\n00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.520\nregardless of how many differentials.\n\n391\n00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.140\nAnd it achieves that by\nleaving the logs alone.\n\n392\n00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.252\nSo if you run a full backup or\nan incremental backup,\n\n393\n00:19:26.252 --> 00:19:30.190\nit'll flush those transactions,\nas long as you empty them out.\n\n394\n00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:33.120\nIf you don't do that, if you're running\nExchange and you're not backing\n\n395\n00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.370\nup your server regularly, maybe you're\nbackup software starts malfunctioning and\n\n396\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.680\nit's not running, or maybe you use some\nthird party software that's not Exchange\n\n397\n00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.870\naware, then you're transaction auxiliary\nare gonna grow and grow and grow and\n\n398\n00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.398\ngrow, until they fill the hard drive.\n\n399\n00:19:44.398 --> 00:19:47.660\nAnd your server's gonna get slower and\nslower and slower and\n\n400\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.800\nslower, cuz it's constantly having to\ncheck those log files to see if there's\n\n401\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.820\nchanges that haven't been\nwritten to the data base yet.\n\n402\n00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.720\nSo it really starts to kill performance,\nso\n\n403\n00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.260\nyou gotta keep an eye on\nthose transaction log files.\n\n404\n00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.910\nNow, this is all default behavior,\nwe want this behavior, but\n\n405\n00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.750\nyou can disable the transaction log files.\n\n406\n00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.940\nThere's something called circular logging.\n\n407\n00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.770\nWith circular logging,\nit just makes, I think it's five or\n\n408\n00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.830\nten transaction log files and\nthat's it, it stops there.\n\n409\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.690\nAnd then, when it writes new data,\nit just overwrites the oldest data.\n\n410\n00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:19.670\nSo, it's just operating within\na small set of transaction log files.\n\n411\n00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.214\nThat's okay, but it's not the greatest\nsolution in the world and\n\n412\n00:20:23.214 --> 00:20:24.298\nlet me tell you why.\n\n413\n00:20:24.298 --> 00:20:28.725\nWhen we do circular logging, if I have\na failure, if I have a database failure,\n\n414\n00:20:28.725 --> 00:20:31.895\nI go back and I get my last full backup,\nand I restore it and\n\n415\n00:20:31.895 --> 00:20:33.702\nI'm back in business, right?\n\n416\n00:20:33.702 --> 00:20:36.325\nLet's say I backup my Exchange\nserver every night at midnight.\n\n417\n00:20:36.325 --> 00:20:38.368\nSo every night at midnight, I back it up.\n\n418\n00:20:38.368 --> 00:20:42.670\nAnd here I am at 3 PM in the afternoon,\nand my server fails.\n\n419\n00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.100\nAnd I'm like, great, it failed.\n\n420\n00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.550\nWell, I've got a full backup,\nlet me just go and restore that.\n\n421\n00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.210\nThe problem is the full backup,\nif it ran at midnight and now it's 3 PM,\n\n422\n00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.420\nthat full backup is 15 hours old.\n\n423\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.370\nI lost 15 hours of email, 15 hours of\nemail just gone, incoming, outgoing,\n\n424\n00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.320\nanything that happened the last 15 hours,\ngone.\n\n425\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.660\nIs that okay?\n\n426\n00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.450\nIn your business it might be, right?\n\n427\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.670\nIn your business,\nemail might not be critical.\n\n428\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.950\nAnd so losing 15 hours of email,\nthat might not be a big deal.\n\n429\n00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.200\nYou don't worry about it.\n\n430\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.270\nTurn on circular logging, do full backups.\n\n431\n00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.040\nWorks great, right?\n\n432\n00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.030\nBut, wouldn't it be nice if you\ncould get those 15 hours back?\n\n433\n00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.030\nWell, sometimes you can.\n\n434\n00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.850\nIf I had a full backup\nthat ran at midnight,\n\n435\n00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:25.970\nand then I've got transaction logs\nthat have run all day long for\n\n436\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:31.540\nthose 15 hours, it's possible that\nI could restore my full backup,\n\n437\n00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.690\nand then import those transaction logs and\nget right back to the point of failure.\n\n438\n00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.660\nAnd now I don't lose any email.\n\n439\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.950\nIsn't that better?\n\n440\n00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.500\nAbsolutely, it's better, right?\n\n441\n00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.110\nSo, those transaction logs can really be\na great safety net to help you recover\n\n442\n00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.160\nright to a point of failure, all right?\n\n443\n00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.150\nSo, you don't want to just\ndisable them out of hand.\n\n444\n00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.150\nThey do serve a purpose,\nespecially at times of failure,\n\n445\n00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.260\nthey're really handy to have.\n\n446\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.350\nYou just need to maintain them.\n\n447\n00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.770\nIt's part of running an Exchange server.\n\n448\n00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.270\nIt's really important.\n\n449\n00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.240\nAll right, there are a few other log\nfiles in here, and in fact, I've\n\n450\n00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.270\ntalked long enough that we've actually\ngenerated a third log file here, right?\n\n451\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.010\nSo just the server sitting here running\nhas generated enough to create a new log\n\n452\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.550\nfile while I was talking.\n\n453\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.320\nSome of the other files that we've got\nin here, notice all these JRS files.\n\n454\n00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.110\nThere's ten JRS files,\n1 through 9, and then an A.\n\n455\n00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.160\nWhat are those?\n\n456\n00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.280\nWell, these are reserve files.\n\n457\n00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.650\nWhat happens if your hard drive fills up?\n\n458\n00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:27.120\nIf your hard drive fills up and\n\n459\n00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.610\nyou've got email coming in,\nit can't write it to the database, can it?\n\n460\n00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.260\nIt can't write it to the transaction logs,\nthe file system is full.\n\n461\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.620\nYou're losing them.\n\n462\n00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.710\nSo what these reserve files do\nis they reserve some space.\n\n463\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.250\nI'm reserving 10 megs of space.\n\n464\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:45.950\nAnd if my hard drive ever fills up,\nExchange will dismount the database.\n\n465\n00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:46.980\nIt will take the database offline.\n\n466\n00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.762\nThat will stop incoming email.\n\n467\n00:22:48.762 --> 00:22:52.100\nAnd, it'll write anything\nin the current queues,\n\n468\n00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.530\nright here to these ten files,\nthis reserved space that it's set aside.\n\n469\n00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:56.630\nSo that's what these are.\n\n470\n00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.580\nThese are actually empty,\nthey're empty files.\n\n471\n00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.020\nThere's nothing in them.\n\n472\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.605\nThey're just holding ten megs of\nspace on my hard drive, right?\n\n473\n00:23:03.605 --> 00:23:09.270\nIt's ten files at 1,024 kilobytes each,\nso those are our reserve space.\n\n474\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.350\nThere's only one other file in\nhere that we need to worry.\n\n475\n00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:16.920\nIt's this guy down here at the bottom,\ntmp.edb, and that's a temporary database.\n\n476\n00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.610\nAny temporary data that Exchange works\nwith, like when it's doing mailbox move\n\n477\n00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.410\nrequests and stuff, there's temporary\ndata, it'll get thrown right in there.\n\n478\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.750\nThat database gets flushed regularly and\n\n479\n00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.050\nit's pretty unusual to see it bigger\nthan one or two megs in size.\n\n480\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.545\nIt doesn't normally get very big at all.\n\n481\n00:23:31.545 --> 00:23:35.283\nYou'll see mine's 1.2 megs in size or\nsomething like that.\n\n482\n00:23:35.283 --> 00:23:36.444\nSo, it's usually pretty small.\n\n483\n00:23:36.444 --> 00:23:37.980\nIt's just temporary data.\n\n484\n00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.910\nBut all of these files were created\nwhen I created that database.\n\n485\n00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.910\nAnd now, as I work with the server,\nit's using all this in the background and\n\n486\n00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.980\nI don't really have to worry\nabout it all that much.\n\n487\n00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.760\nIf I go and look at the other\nmailbox database, same thing, right?\n\n488\n00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.584\nIt's got log files.\n\n489\n00:23:52.584 --> 00:23:55.995\nIt actually has more log files than my\nother one, because it's been running\n\n490\n00:23:55.995 --> 00:23:59.567\nlonger, and it's actually got user\nmailboxes in it But I'll see that database\n\n491\n00:23:59.567 --> 00:24:03.780\nfile, it's got it's own temp file, I'll\nsee its checkpoints, it's reserve files.\n\n492\n00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.335\nSame basic structure, you expect to see\nthis for all of your mailbox database,\n\n493\n00:24:07.335 --> 00:24:07.876\nall right?\n\n494\n00:24:07.876 --> 00:24:10.667\nSo that's the basic structure and\nthe key takeaway here that I want you guys\n\n495\n00:24:10.667 --> 00:24:12.840\nto remember are these transaction logs,\nright?\n\n496\n00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.220\nThe transaction logs are what you write to\nfirst before you write to the database.\n\n497\n00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.300\nAnd that gives you that\ndatabase integrity.\n\n498\n00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.220\nNow if I jump back to my Exchange\nManagement screen, back here in the admin\n\n499\n00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.370\ncenter, I could take my sales database and\nif I edit the sales database,\n\n500\n00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.380\nI'll see some various settings\non there that I can tweak.\n\n501\n00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.320\nAnd some of it,\n\n502\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.880\nlike here on the general page, there's not\na whole heck of a lot that I can modify.\n\n503\n00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.270\nI can modify the name.\n\n504\n00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:42.160\nSo I could give it one of those unique\nnames if I wanted to like the big\n\n505\n00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.210\nlong name that we saw on the other one.\n\n506\n00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.471\nI could go crazy, or\nI could just leave it be, right?\n\n507\n00:24:46.471 --> 00:24:47.080\nSo you can modify that.\n\n508\n00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.700\nBut most of this is just information.\n\n509\n00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.610\nWhen was the last full backup?\n\n510\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.730\nWhen was the last incremental backup,\nright?\n\n511\n00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:53.930\nWhat's its current status?\n\n512\n00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.150\nWhat servers that mounted to?\n\n513\n00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:55.710\nAnd so on.\n\n514\n00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:56.670\nJust basic information.\n\n515\n00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.980\nMost of this you can't change.\n\n516\n00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.760\nIt's just giving you that data.\n\n517\n00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.690\nUnder maintenance, here we actually can\ntweak a few things and the one that I want\n\n518\n00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:08.150\nto point out is right here at the bottom,\nEnable Circular Logging.\n\n519\n00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.080\nIf I don't want transaction log files,\nhere's where I can fix that.\n\n520\n00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.980\nI can check that, and that's gonna\nturn off transaction log files.\n\n521\n00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.010\nYou still have transaction 1000 it's\ngoing to start overriding them.\n\n522\n00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.210\nSo new data will override the old.\n\n523\n00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.997\nYou won't have hundreds or thousands.\n\n524\n00:25:22.997 --> 00:25:25.610\nYou'll have five or\nI can't remember if it's five or ten,\n\n525\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.078\nit's a real small amount of transaction\nlog files and that's it, all right?\n\n526\n00:25:29.078 --> 00:25:31.938\nThere's other things you can tweak like\nwhether you want to allow background\n\n527\n00:25:31.938 --> 00:25:32.820\nmaintenance.\n\n528\n00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.700\nIt's constantly defragmenting and trying\nto compact the database in the background.\n\n529\n00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.120\nAnd you can turn that off if you want.\n\n530\n00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.360\nYou can set a schedule for it, for\nwhen those maintenance routines run.\n\n531\n00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.200\nSet it for off-peak hours.\n\n532\n00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.230\nYou can set whether the databases\nmounted at startup.\n\n533\n00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.470\nMaybe you don't want it to mount\nautomatically, you mount it yourself.\n\n534\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.570\nThere's not a lot of reason for that.\n\n535\n00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.740\nThen there's this guy.\n\n536\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.600\nThis database can be\noverwritten by a restore.\n\n537\n00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.030\nWe'll see this in the episode\nwhere we do back-ups and restores.\n\n538\n00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.690\nIn order to restore over a database,\nyou need to turn this option on.\n\n539\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.510\nIt's off by default, and\nthat's a protection mechanism.\n\n540\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.930\nIt's to save you from accidentally\noverriding your database,\n\n541\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.880\nbecause you might want to recover\nthose transaction log files.\n\n542\n00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.883\nAnd when you do a restore, it wipes\nthe transaction log files by default.\n\n543\n00:26:13.883 --> 00:26:15.009\nWe want to be able to get those.\n\n544\n00:26:15.009 --> 00:26:17.588\nSo those are all important.\n\n545\n00:26:17.588 --> 00:26:19.335\nI mentioned at the beginning\nof the episode we can set\n\n546\n00:26:19.335 --> 00:26:20.380\nlimits on a mailbox database.\n\n547\n00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.270\nWe'll see that right here\nunder the limits section.\n\n548\n00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:26.950\nI can say I only want users to\nhave a certain amount of space.\n\n549\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.580\nThis is my sales mailbox database.\n\n550\n00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.900\nSo I want salespeople to have a,\nwe'll say a 4 gig mailbox.\n\n551\n00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.040\nAnd so I can come in here,\nand I can set limits, right?\n\n552\n00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:41.120\nI can say issue them a warning\nwhen they get to 3.5 GB, right?\n\n553\n00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.770\nAt 3.5 I'm gonna warn them.\n\n554\n00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:50.080\nAnd then, at 3.7 I'm gonna stop\nthem from being able to send email.\n\n555\n00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.640\nThey're not gonna be able\nto send email anymore.\n\n556\n00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:57.180\nThey can still receive but they can't\nsend until they clean up their mail box.\n\n557\n00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.410\nAnd then I can come in here and\n\n558\n00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.540\nI can say when they hit 4 GB, I'm going\nto stop them from sending and receiving.\n\n559\n00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.100\nThat's it, there mailbox is full.\n\n560\n00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.020\nThey won't be able to receive any data.\n\n561\n00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.150\nNow, that's not a terribly popular\noption because if email is critical for\n\n562\n00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.570\nyour company, you want people\nto be able to send and receive.\n\n563\n00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.220\nSo a lot of times I'll come in here and\njust set these to Unlimited.\n\n564\n00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.210\nSo I'm never gonna stop them\nfrom sending and receiving, but\n\n565\n00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:21.310\nI am gonna issue them a warning.\n\n566\n00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:22.940\nAnd it'll annoy the heck out of them,\nright?\n\n567\n00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.367\nOnce a day,\nthey'll get this warning message.\n\n568\n00:27:24.367 --> 00:27:27.270\nDuring our maintenance window is when\nit generates these warning messages.\n\n569\n00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:31.250\nSo if the maintenance window is midnight\nto 3, somewhere in between midnight and\n\n570\n00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.380\n3 AM, they'll get this warning\nmessage that will say,\n\n571\n00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.350\nyour mailbox is over its limit or\nyour mailbox is approaching its limit.\n\n572\n00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.310\nAnd they'll get that every single day.\n\n573\n00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.170\nThey could choose to ignore or\nthey could clean it up.\n\n574\n00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.800\nWe also specify retention\ninformation right here so I want\n\n575\n00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.450\nto keep deleted items for 14 days, I want\nto keep deleted mailboxes for 30 days.\n\n576\n00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.640\nI can tweak that if I want,\nor I can leave it like this.\n\n577\n00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.420\nMaybe I want it to be shorter or longer.\n\n578\n00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.883\nKeeping deleted items, if a user throws\nan item in the recycle bin and they empty\n\n579\n00:27:58.883 --> 00:28:02.449\nthe recycle bin, we actually retain it for\n14 more days, and they can recover it\n\n580\n00:28:02.449 --> 00:28:05.832\nright through Outlook if they want, or\nwe can recover it as administrators.\n\n581\n00:28:05.832 --> 00:28:08.862\nWe might wanna bump that up to something\nlarger to be able to maintain that.\n\n582\n00:28:08.862 --> 00:28:10.770\nYou'll see it will go up till 24,000 days.\n\n583\n00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.560\nThat's a long time.\n\n584\n00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.070\nThat's probably longer than\nany of our careers will be so\n\n585\n00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.710\nthat will get us covered.\n\n586\n00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.440\nAnother neat option down here\nis on the deleted mail boxes.\n\n587\n00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.640\nYou can say I wanna hold\nany deleted mailbox for\n\n588\n00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.740\n30 days, but then you can turn\non this other option that says\n\n589\n00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.220\neven if it's been more than 30 days, keep\nthe mailbox if a backup hasn't been run.\n\n590\n00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.280\nAnd that way we can ensure that a copy\nof this mailbox is still in a backup\n\n591\n00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.200\nsomewhere, so that's a neat little\noption to be able to turn on.\n\n592\n00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.620\nAnd here's that warning message interval.\n\n593\n00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.450\nYou'll see it's set to midnight here.\n\n594\n00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.100\nWe can set when those messages go out.\n\n595\n00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.370\nAnd then last we've got\nour client settings.\n\n596\n00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.340\nI'm going to talk about this\nin the address book episode.\n\n597\n00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.720\nWe can define what offline address book\nour end users are going to make use of.\n\n598\n00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.410\nI'm just going to leave that be for\nright now.\n\n599\n00:28:53.482 --> 00:28:56.020\nAll right, so those are all different\nthings that we can tweak in our\n\n600\n00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.800\nmailbox databases and get them set up.\n\n601\n00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.080\nNow I kinda talked a long time on that.\n\n602\n00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.640\nWe covered some really important stuff.\n\n603\n00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.490\nI have more I wanna talk about\non mailbox databases though,\n\n604\n00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:07.930\nespecially when it comes\nto file system tuning.\n\n605\n00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.380\nThere's some stuff we can do on our server\nto make it perform at its peak, and\n\n606\n00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.250\nit's really important.\n\n607\n00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.810\nSo I wanna make sure I tackle that and\nI take my time with it.\n\n608\n00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.380\nSo let's do a part two to this episode.\n\n609\n00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.630\nWe covered mailbox databases here,\nthe basics, getting one created and\n\n610\n00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:20.930\nthe basic settings.\n\n611\n00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.730\nBut I wanna do some more on tweaking and\nperformance, so definitely stay tuned for\n\n612\n00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.360\nthat, but for now, we'll go ahead and\nwrap this episode up.\n\n613\n00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.250\nAll right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed this one.\n\n614\n00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.141\nStay tuned for part two,\nit's definitely coming up next.\n\n615\n00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:34.587\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet, and\n\n616\n00:29:34.587 --> 00:29:35.843\nI'll see you next time.\n\n617\n00:29:35.843 --> 00:29:41.740\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

evening, and welcome back.\n\n4\n00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.349\nTo another episode of ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.020\nBack again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.390\nIn this episode, we're actually picking\nup where our last episode left off.\n\n7\n00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.880\nWe started our mailbox databases and\nwell I just talked too much.\n\n8\n00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.770\nSo, in this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.590\nwe're going to continue on with\npart two of mailbox databases.\n\n10\n00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.830\nWe got a chance to see in the last\nepisode how to create a database and\n\n11\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.520\nall the files that are kind\nof involved in it.\n\n12\n00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.880\nI talked a little bit about\ntransaction logs and databases and\n\n13\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.170\nall that good stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.610\nIn this episode, I wanna talk about\ntuning those databases for performance.\n\n15\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.710\nNow, by default, Exchange is taking\ncare of indexing the data, and\n\n16\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.040\ndefragmenting the database.\n\n17\n00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.280\nSo that stuff we really\ndon't have to worry about.\n\n18\n00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.190\nBut what we do have to worry\nabout is disk contention.\n\n19\n00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.250\nWhen you create databases, by default it's\ngonna throw them into C:/Program Files,\n\n20\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.990\nit's gonna throw them\nright on your C:/ drive.\n\n21\n00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.150\nAnd that means, at a minimum,\nif you just have one mailbox database,\n\n22\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.520\nat a minimum, it's gonna be contending for\ndisk access with your operating system.\n\n23\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.030\nSo the database and your operating\nsystem both fighting to read and\n\n24\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.050\nwrite to the same hard drive.\n\n25\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.330\nIf you have more than\none mailbox database,\n\n26\n00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.230\nthey are contending against each other for\naccess to that file system.\n\n27\n00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.440\nSo we're probably going to\nwant to spread our data out.\n\n28\n00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.060\nWe're gonna move our databases\noff to separate hard drives, so\n\n29\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.750\nthey can have exclusive\naccess to those drives.\n\n30\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.730\nAll right now, when I talk about\ndiscontention, what am I talking about?\n\n31\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.540\nWell when we have a hard drive,\n\n32\n00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.570\na hard drive, it's got a spinning disk\ninside of it or it might be SSD, right?\n\n33\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.960\nIt might be solid state.\n\n34\n00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.060\nBut, either way, you've got to go through\na controller to then access the data.\n\n35\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.880\nOn a solid state drive,\nthe controller can only handle so\n\n36\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.700\nmany operations at one time.\n\n37\n00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.730\nSo you end up with a queue where people\nare waiting in line to access the drive.\n\n38\n00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.170\nIt's much worse on spinning disks.\n\n39\n00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.420\nOn a spinning disk, there's this\nmechanical head that moves back and\n\n40\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.230\nforth on the disk to read data.\n\n41\n00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.160\nThat mechanical head can only\nbe in one place at a time.\n\n42\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.140\nSo a mechanical spinning disk can\nonly handle one operation at a time.\n\n43\n00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.900\nAnd that creates a big queue.\n\n44\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.110\nSSD can do a lot more and it does a lot\nfaster, that's definitely better.\n\n45\n00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.680\nSo again we might shift our data over\nto those types of disks that do it.\n\n46\n00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.110\nIn addition to that we're probably worried\nabout redundancy because hard drives fail\n\n47\n00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.540\nall the time.\n\n48\n00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.570\nIt's a rare hard drive these days that\nwill last you more than three years.\n\n49\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.430\nSo knowing that disk failure is eminent,\nwe need a plan for that.\n\n50\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.360\nSo we're typically going to put our\ndatabases on top of RAID arrays.\n\n51\n00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.330\nWell RAID,\nthe redundant array of independent disks,\n\n52\n00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.550\nthat can give you resiliency\nseveral different ways.\n\n53\n00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.910\nAnd we need to understand how\nthey each affect the database.\n\n54\n00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.530\nSo I wanna spend a minute to kinda go\nthrough the different RAID technologies.\n\n55\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.320\nAnd how they affect Microsoft Exchange.\n\n56\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.290\nBecause we all probably, by this point you\nguys probably already know RAID 0, RAID 1,\n\n57\n00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.120\nRAID 5, you know, they're not new.\n\n58\n00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.180\nBut, how they affect\nExchange is important.\n\n59\n00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.480\nAnd when we talk about\nhow it affects Exchange,\n\n60\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.930\nwe have to remember that there's\ntwo pieces of our mailbox database.\n\n61\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.890\nThere's the database itself, and\nthere's the transaction log files.\n\n62\n00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.790\nThe database, we are reading\nfrom the database constantly.\n\n63\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.890\nEverybody checking their email,\ngoing in there.\n\n64\n00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.890\nWe read from that database all the time.\n\n65\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.270\nSo read operations are really important.\n\n66\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.280\nWe write to the database also,\nbut not as often.\n\n67\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.270\nIn fact,\nend users never write to the database.\n\n68\n00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.380\nEnd users all write to\nthe transaction log files.\n\n69\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.920\nAnd then it's the system that writes\nfrom the transaction log files into\n\n70\n00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.800\nthe database.\n\n71\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.020\nSo it's really just one person\nwriting to the database.\n\n72\n00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.250\nWhereas you might have thousands of\npeople reading from the database.\n\n73\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.610\nOnly one person, the Exchange service,\nis writing to the database itself.\n\n74\n00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.330\nSo the reads and\nwrites are a little weird.\n\n75\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.090\nYour transaction logs\nare very write heavy.\n\n76\n00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.410\nYour database is very read heavy.\n\n77\n00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.040\nAnd so\nthe file systems need to be different.\n\n78\n00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.180\nYou can put the database and\n\n79\n00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.710\nthe transaction log files in\nthe same folder if you want.\n\n80\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.590\nIn fact, that's the default.\n\n81\n00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.920\nRight here,\nI'll take this Exchange server.\n\n82\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.990\nAnd here's an Exchange server.\n\n83\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.900\nI did a default install on it.\n\n84\n00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.637\nAnd right here in\nC:\\ProgramFiles\\Microsoft\\ExchangeServer\\-\n\n85\n00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:19.420\nV15\\Mailbox we can see the Mailbox\nDatabase and here's all the files.\n\n86\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.700\nAnd I've got, I'll find it here,\nthe E00, let's see here we go,\n\n87\n00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.100\nhere is Mailbox Database\n201376320 whatever .edb.\n\n88\n00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.470\nThat's the exchange database.\n\n89\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.740\nThat's going to be really read heavy.\n\n90\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.160\nThen see all these transaction log files?\n\n91\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.260\nThose transaction log files\nare going to be very write heavy and\n\n92\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.060\nthey're right here in the same place.\n\n93\n00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.630\nSo now, when users are trying to read from\nthe drive and other people are trying to\n\n94\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.320\nwrite to the transaction log files,\nthey're fighting for access to that disk.\n\n95\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.410\nThis isn't great.\n\n96\n00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.670\nFor a small environment, maybe even a\nmedium environment that might be okay, but\n\n97\n00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.610\nwhen you start getting into the thousands\nof mailboxes, or tens of thousands,\n\n98\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.710\nhundreds of thousands of mailboxes,\nthis will kill your server.\n\n99\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.450\nDisperformance will be your big problem.\n\n100\n00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.630\nSo, we need a better solution.\n\n101\n00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.680\nAt a minimum, it's recommended\nto split your database and\n\n102\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.680\ntransaction log files onto\nseparate hard drives, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.340\nIf my databases are on one set of hard\ndrives, and my transaction log files\n\n104\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.590\nare on a different set,\nmy reads are happening on set 1,\n\n105\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.230\nmy writes are happening on set 2,\nthings are spread out.\n\n106\n00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.030\nWe get better disk access.\n\n107\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.990\nIf I go a step further and\nseparate my mailbox databases themselves,\n\n108\n00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.450\neach mailbox database getting\nits own set of hard drives.\n\n109\n00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.220\nThat's even better for\nreducing contention, but\n\n110\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.710\nyou guys are probably\nstarting to see dollar signs.\n\n111\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.750\nIt gets more and more expensive.\n\n112\n00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.320\nYou gotta buy this extra hardware, but\n\n113\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.930\nif performance is your concern,\nyou gotta do it.\n\n114\n00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.410\nYou've gotta make sure you've got the\navailable through put to be able to read\n\n115\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.420\nand write the data to your system.\n\n116\n00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.750\nThe other thing to remember\nis if we have a failure,\n\n117\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.230\nwe can always restore\nour last full backup.\n\n118\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.500\nAnd that'll restore this guy right here.\n\n119\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.400\nThat'll restore the database, but\n\n120\n00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.390\nI lose any email that happened since\nthat full backup was taken, right?\n\n121\n00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.890\nBut if I can recover my transaction logs,\nI can get right to the point of failure.\n\n122\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.810\nWell, if I just lost my database, and the\ntransactions logs are on the same drive as\n\n123\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.510\nthe database,\nI probably lost them too, didn't I?\n\n124\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.040\nSo there's not really\na point in keeping them,\n\n125\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.970\nmight as well turn on circular logging.\n\n126\n00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.030\nBut if I put my transaction logs\non separate hard drives, and\n\n127\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.030\nI lose the array that has the database.\n\n128\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.120\nI can restore a full\nbackup of my database.\n\n129\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.270\nAnd then I can salvage the transaction\nlogs that are still right here on\n\n130\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.690\na separate set of hard drives.\n\n131\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.470\nBring those over, and I can reapply\n\n132\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.470\nthose changes to the database to bring\nit right to the point of failure.\n\n133\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.100\nI don't lose any email,\nand that's a great thing.\n\n134\n00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.510\nSo, separating these files out.\n\n135\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.030\nWhen I installed this,\nwell, here I'll show you.\n\n136\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.690\nIf we go back into our Exchange admin\ncenter, we can go down to servers and\n\n137\n00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.060\ndatabases.\n\n138\n00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.130\nWhen you add in a database,\n\n139\n00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.330\nit actually gives you the chance right\nhere to specify alternate paths.\n\n140\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.750\nWe can put these in different places.\n\n141\n00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.840\nThe problem is a lot of us don't think\nabout it when you create the database.\n\n142\n00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.580\nThink about it after the fact.\n\n143\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.110\nSo you go to create the database, and\n\n144\n00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.300\nthen a year later, two years later things\nhave grown, it starts getting slow, and\n\n145\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.930\nyou go, boy I really wish I\nwould have separated those out.\n\n146\n00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.590\nWell, you can move them after the fact.\n\n147\n00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.130\nYou can't do it through the GUI.\n\n148\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.765\nSo if I were to take my sales database\nhere and edit that and go in the path.\n\n149\n00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:18.755\nSee how it's grayed out?\n\n150\n00:07:18.755 --> 00:07:19.745\nIt won't let me change that.\n\n151\n00:07:19.745 --> 00:07:22.065\nEven if I unmount the database\nI can't change that.\n\n152\n00:07:22.065 --> 00:07:23.505\nIt's kinda stuck where it is.\n\n153\n00:07:23.505 --> 00:07:28.305\nBut we can drop to the Powershell and\nwe can move that database somewhere else.\n\n154\n00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:32.635\nSo if I take this server for\nexample, let me go here into my\n\n155\n00:07:32.635 --> 00:07:36.395\ncomputer management utility, I've got\na couple of hard drives in this server.\n\n156\n00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:38.260\nSo I can start to make use of those.\n\n157\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.920\nSo I can jump in here and\ngo down to my disk management.\n\n158\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.470\nAnd you'll see I have a C: drive,\nthat's where my operating system is.\n\n159\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.980\nBut then I've got these extra\nhard drives sitting down here.\n\n160\n00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.430\nI've got a 20 gig E: drive, and\n\n161\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.715\na looks like a 128 gig F: drive that\nI'm not really using for anything.\n\n162\n00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:57.506\nSo I can take these and\nI can move my other data to them.\n\n163\n00:07:57.506 --> 00:07:59.384\nSo I can take that E: drive,\n\n164\n00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:03.546\nfor example, and I might call\nthat my transaction logs drive.\n\n165\n00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:06.486\nSo I'm gonna start putting my\ntransaction logs on the E drive.\n\n166\n00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:10.907\nAnd then I can take my F drive and\nI could make that my database drives, or\n\n167\n00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.430\nI could call this my Mailbox Databases.\n\n168\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.210\nAll right, so I'm just kinda naming them.\n\n169\n00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:16.970\nYou don't have to name them.\n\n170\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.530\nI'm just doing it so\nI can keep it straight.\n\n171\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.570\nSo I've got an E drive and an F drive, and\nthat's where I wanna start storing those,\n\n172\n00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:26.680\nseparating these out, trying to\nremove some of that disk contention.\n\n173\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.242\nAll right, so then I can jump down\ninto my PowerShell and I'll fire.\n\n174\n00:08:31.242 --> 00:08:33.220\nWait, this is important.\n\n175\n00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.170\nI need to use some Exchange\ncommandlets and the regular PowerShell\n\n176\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.070\ndoesn't have them, so I need to make\nsure I run the Exchange PowerShell.\n\n177\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.430\nSo let me just jump here\nto my start screen and\n\n178\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.820\nI'll fire up\nthe Exchange Management Shell.\n\n179\n00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.255\nRemember the Exchange Management Shell is\njust like the regular PowerShell except\n\n180\n00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:50.150\nthat it's got all the Exchange\ncommandlets added to it.\n\n181\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.620\nI'm doing it here on the server.\n\n182\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.001\nI could have done like\na PSremote from a client and\n\n183\n00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:57.153\nconnected up the same way that I\nhave the commandlets there too.\n\n184\n00:08:57.153 --> 00:09:01.857\nSo this will get me in here and\nthen I'll bump that font size up a bit so\n\n185\n00:09:01.857 --> 00:09:04.511\nwe'll be able to see what I'm doing.\n\n186\n00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:07.970\nSince that's not necessarily\nsuper legible like it is.\n\n187\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.641\nAnd [SOUND] there we go.\n\n188\n00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:15.013\nAll right, so what we're looking at here\nis just the Exchange Management Shell and\n\n189\n00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:17.250\nI wanna move that Sales database.\n\n190\n00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.960\nWell, I'm gonna make a couple\nof folders here real quick.\n\n191\n00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.880\nI'm gonna make E:\\TL, that's where I'm\ngonna be putting my transaction logs.\n\n192\n00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.700\nAnd then I'm gonna make F:\\DB, that's\nwhere I'm gonna be putting my databases.\n\n193\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.370\nAnd now I can start to\nmove these guys around.\n\n194\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.840\nAnd the command for\nthat is the Move-DatabasePath.\n\n195\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.600\nBut the problem with that command,\nMove-DatabasePath,\n\n196\n00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.290\nI have to know the name of\nthe database and all that.\n\n197\n00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:47.495\nSo when I do this, I almost always\nstart with just Get-MailboxDatabase,\n\n198\n00:09:47.495 --> 00:09:49.855\nand that's gonna give me a list\nof all my mailbox databases.\n\n199\n00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:53.355\nIt will give you a list for the whole\norganization, so you'll see everything.\n\n200\n00:09:53.355 --> 00:09:56.575\nAnd I can see there's that default\ndatabase that was created, and\n\n201\n00:09:56.575 --> 00:09:59.555\nthere's the Sales database that I made,\nand that's the one that I wanna move.\n\n202\n00:09:59.555 --> 00:10:01.705\nI'm gonna move that one around.\n\n203\n00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:05.859\nSo now I can come in and\nI can say, Move-DatabasePath, and\n\n204\n00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:09.160\nI can specify the identity,\nwhich is sales.\n\n205\n00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.810\nIt's my sales database\nthat I'm gonna be moving.\n\n206\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.560\nAnd then I can tell it what\nI'm gonna be moving around.\n\n207\n00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.480\nI'm gonna say my EdbFilePath, and\nI'll specify where I want that to go.\n\n208\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.741\nWell, I want that to\ngo to F:\\DB\\Sales.edb.\n\n209\n00:10:23.741 --> 00:10:26.230\nThat's where I want that one to end up,\nso I'm gonna move it there.\n\n210\n00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:36.800\nThen I can say -LogFolderPath and I can\nspecify where I want this one to go to.\n\n211\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.660\nNow my log folder path I want it\nto be a different set of drives.\n\n212\n00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.930\nAnd so this one I'm gonna\nmove to E:\\TL\\ and then you\n\n213\n00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.440\ncan give it a subfolder or you can just\nthrow it right into there if I wanted.\n\n214\n00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.500\nI probably should have\ncreated a sales folder, and\n\n215\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.840\nI don't remember if it'll create it for\nme.\n\n216\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.270\nSo we'll find out right here.\n\n217\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.470\nSo I'm just gonna create a folder\ncalled Sales to stick it in there.\n\n218\n00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.250\nSo now I'm telling it I\nwant to move the database.\n\n219\n00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.630\nAnd when I run that, it's going to\nreach in there and it's gonna move it.\n\n220\n00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.420\nSo there it goes, moving that database.\n\n221\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.500\nIt's telling me that am I\nsure that I want to do it?\n\n222\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.820\nSo I'll go ahead and say yes to that,\nand there it goes, moving that over.\n\n223\n00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.640\nIt's telling me, To perform the operation\nit must be temporarily dismounted.\n\n224\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.397\nIt's going to kick my users out, so\n\n225\n00:11:16.397 --> 00:11:19.330\nthis is definitely\nan after-hours type operation.\n\n226\n00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.120\nWe don't want people in the database and\nthen we kick them out.\n\n227\n00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.770\nThey'll see it as Outlook going offline,\n\n228\n00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.570\nand then when the move is\ndone it'll come back online.\n\n229\n00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.990\nBut the move could take a while,\ncouldn't it?\n\n230\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.010\nIf you've got a mailbox database\nthat's a terabyte in size,\n\n231\n00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.730\nit's gonna take a while to copy.\n\n232\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.220\nSo we definitely wanna plan around that.\n\n233\n00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.400\nI'm gonna go ahead and say yes to do it.\n\n234\n00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.810\nAnd there it goes.\nIt's gonna dismount the database,\n\n235\n00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.410\nit's gonna copy the files\nto the new location, and\n\n236\n00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.080\nit's gonna remount the database and\nbring back it online.\n\n237\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.735\nAnd now my database and\n\n238\n00:11:44.735 --> 00:11:47.940\nmy transaction log files will be spread\nout on these separate hard drives.\n\n239\n00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:53.300\nAnd that was all done with the\nMove-DatabasePath PowerShell commandlet.\n\n240\n00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.360\nNow it doesn't take too terribly\nlong to do it for a small database.\n\n241\n00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.110\nNow pay attention to\nthe time it's taking mine.\n\n242\n00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.370\nNow my disk IO is kind\nof constrained here.\n\n243\n00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.616\nI actually only have one hard drive, so\nyou'll see a little contention there, but\n\n244\n00:12:05.616 --> 00:12:09.331\nmy mailbox database, it was only,\nI think it was like 250MB in size.\n\n245\n00:12:09.331 --> 00:12:11.040\nIt was very, very small.\n\n246\n00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.790\nSo imagine if it's a terabyte or\neven 50 gigabytes,\n\n247\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.480\nit's going to take longer than that.\n\n248\n00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.900\nSo it could take an hour, it could take\nhours your mail system might be offline.\n\n249\n00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.938\nYou're not losing email during this time.\n\n250\n00:12:22.938 --> 00:12:24.710\nYour mail queues are still running, so\n\n251\n00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.710\nany incoming email is just getting\nstuck in the queue and sitting there.\n\n252\n00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:32.030\nSo you're not losing email, but it's gonna\nhave to take time to kinda rearrange.\n\n253\n00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.930\nAnd then when the database\ncomes back online,\n\n254\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.820\nwhich mine just did,\nall the email in the queue gets delivered.\n\n255\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.080\nSo I don't lose email.\n\n256\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.530\nJust users can't get into their email.\n\n257\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.190\nAll right, when it's done,\nnow my database should be moved.\n\n258\n00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.910\nIf I go back to my\nExchange Management Center.\n\n259\n00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.970\nAnd I'll take Sales here,\nand I'm gonna edit it.\n\n260\n00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:56.520\nWhen I go into its settings,\nit shows that new path, F:\\DB\\Sales.edb.\n\n261\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.560\nSo that data moved and\nI can go verify that on the server too\n\n262\n00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.570\nif I browse around on the hard\ndrive of this server.\n\n263\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:07.020\nLet me just jump over to my F drive, and\n\n264\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.590\nthere's that DB folder and\nthere's Sales.edb, it's about 250MB.\n\n265\n00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:16.510\nAnd if I go to my E drive,\nthere's the TL folder I made and\n\n266\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.920\nthe Sales folder, and\nthere's the transaction logs for it.\n\n267\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.850\nAnd notice it didn't flush my\ntransaction logs, it just moved them.\n\n268\n00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.565\nMoved them to the new location and\noff it went.\n\n269\n00:13:25.735 --> 00:13:26.805\nNow I say it moved.\n\n270\n00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:28.925\nIt actually does a copy operation so\n\n271\n00:13:28.925 --> 00:13:31.905\nthat if something goes wrong it can\nalways just fail back to the source.\n\n272\n00:13:31.905 --> 00:13:34.955\nAnd it's only when the copy is done\nthat it removes the original, so\n\n273\n00:13:34.955 --> 00:13:38.465\nit's not a true move,\nit's a copy and then delete.\n\n274\n00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:41.375\nBut there we go,\nwe've moved off to separate drives.\n\n275\n00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:43.325\nNow I've alleviated some\nof my disk contention.\n\n276\n00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.860\nThat is a key thing.\n\n277\n00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.270\nWhen you're setting up\nan Exchange Server for\n\n278\n00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:51.210\na large organization, you're typically\ngonna want four sets of drives.\n\n279\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.520\nYou want a set of drives for\nthe operating system.\n\n280\n00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.980\nYou want a set of drives for\nyour page file.\n\n281\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.410\nYou want a set of drives for\nyour transaction logs.\n\n282\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.470\nAnd you want a set of drives for\nyour mailbox database.\n\n283\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.260\nFour sets of drives.\n\n284\n00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.490\nNow I say sets because you don't\nwant just one hard drive for each.\n\n285\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.670\nYou want them to be RAID arrays.\n\n286\n00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.420\nYou want them to be redundant or\noptimized, so\n\n287\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.670\nthere's some additional\nconsiderations there.\n\n288\n00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.780\nThe other thing is,\ndon't think about partitions.\n\n289\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.680\nJust put partitions out of your mind.\n\n290\n00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.280\nSome people say all right,\nI'll take a drive and\n\n291\n00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.190\nI'll divide it into four partitions.\n\n292\n00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.780\nThe problem there is it's still one drive,\nright?\n\n293\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.810\nThat's basically what I've done here in\nmy lab is I've got this one partition.\n\n294\n00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:30.770\nSo when I'm writing to\npartition 1 versus partition 2,\n\n295\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.910\nI'm still using the same hardware and\nI still get the same contention.\n\n296\n00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.890\nSo partitions really don't help\nyou at all in Exchange land.\n\n297\n00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.470\nIt's just kind of a waste of time.\n\n298\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.190\nSo I'm really talking about\nseparate physical disks.\n\n299\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.090\nAll right, now in my case I threw\nthese to separate physical disks.\n\n300\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.340\nNow I'm optimized and I'm done, right?\n\n301\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.270\nWell, I can do better.\n\n302\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.390\nJust throwing it on a single\ndisk gives us two problems.\n\n303\n00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.810\nOne, you've got a single set of\nhardware working for you, so\n\n304\n00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.950\nyou have limited throughput.\n\n305\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.470\nThe other one is you've got\nsingle points of failure.\n\n306\n00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.980\nIf my E drive fails,\n\n307\n00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.380\nI just lost my transaction logs,\nmy database goes offline.\n\n308\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.130\nIf my F drive fails, I just lost my\ndatabase, database goes offline.\n\n309\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.090\nIf my C drive fails, I just lost my\noperating system, database goes offline.\n\n310\n00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.900\nSo any one of those failing will\nbring my whole system down.\n\n311\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.410\nI need redundancy.\n\n312\n00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.960\nThe problem is redundancy normally\ncomes at a cost of performance.\n\n313\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.790\nSo we have to find a balance\nbetween performance and redundancy,\n\n314\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.670\nand that's what RAID lets us\ndo is we get that choice.\n\n315\n00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.680\nSo let's take a look at some\noptions as far as using RAID.\n\n316\n00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.500\nThere's really four main types of\nRAID that we worry about today.\n\n317\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.480\nRAID 0, 1, 5 and 10.\n\n318\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.120\nRAID 0 is all about performance.\n\n319\n00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.960\nIf you want the fastest\nmailbox database or\n\n320\n00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.340\nthe fastest transaction logs,\nRAID 0 is your winner.\n\n321\n00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.420\nThis is gonna get you\nthe best performance.\n\n322\n00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.860\nWhen you do RAID 0, when you write\ndata to the drive, it's striped,\n\n323\n00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.690\nit's spread across multiple drives.\n\n324\n00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.260\nSo in this example I've got three drives.\n\n325\n00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.043\nAnd so when it takes data, it writes\nit and breaks it up into chunks, and\n\n326\n00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:04.220\nI get chunk one here, two here, three\nhere, spread across the three drives.\n\n327\n00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.741\nAnd then when it gets to chunk\nnumber four, it jumps right back.\n\n328\n00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:09.550\nAnd now we're on Drive 1 gets Block 4.\n\n329\n00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:10.910\nDrive 2 gets Block 5.\n\n330\n00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.070\nDrive 3 gets Block 6, and so on.\n\n331\n00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.210\nIt's spreading it across the drives.\n\n332\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.610\nThat means when I write, I've got three\npieces of hardware doing the write.\n\n333\n00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.090\nI can write three times as fast.\n\n334\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.350\nAnd when I read, I've got three\npieces of hardware doing the read.\n\n335\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.050\nI can read three times as fast.\n\n336\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.030\nSo RAID 0 is all about speed.\n\n337\n00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.620\nIf I have three drives,\nI'm three times as fast.\n\n338\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.050\nIf I have five drives, I'm five times.\n\n339\n00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.550\nIf I have ten drives,\nI'm ten times as fast.\n\n340\n00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:39.330\nSo the more hard drives the better\nwhen it comes to RAID 0, all right.\n\n341\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.830\nHere's the problem.\n\n342\n00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:45.180\nIf any one of these disks fail,\nall of my data is gone.\n\n343\n00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.800\nRight?\n\n344\n00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.730\nBecause, like here in my example I've\ngot three drives, if I lose one drive,\n\n345\n00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.350\nI just lost a third of my data.\n\n346\n00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.400\nIf I lose a third of my database,\nwhat am I left with?\n\n347\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.480\nA corrupt database.\n\n348\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.000\nRight?\n\n349\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.350\nSo, I don't get any redundancy.\n\n350\n00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.710\nIf I'm just looking for\nperformance, this is it.\n\n351\n00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.840\nNow, some of you guys have probably\nput this out of your mind now,\n\n352\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.130\nsaying well I'm never going to do RAID 0,\nlet me throw that out.\n\n353\n00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.300\nDon't do that.\n\n354\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:10.220\nBecause what if you're running something\nlike where you have database copies?\n\n355\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.130\nAll right?\nYes, I'm running RAID 0.\n\n356\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.060\nBut, I've got a copy of\nthe database on another server.\n\n357\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.950\nSo if I have a failure here,\nI just flip over to the copy.\n\n358\n00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.390\nIn the meantime, I get great performance.\n\n359\n00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.210\nI might not have a failure for\nthree years.\n\n360\n00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.160\nSo for three years, I get screaming\nperformance and when a failure happens,\n\n361\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.800\nI just failover to the other node\nversus building redundancy and\n\n362\n00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.830\nnow I get less performance for those three\nyears when everything was running fine.\n\n363\n00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.890\nRight?\nSo Raid 0.\n\n364\n00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.760\nDon't just throw that out.\n\n365\n00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.760\nDon't discount it.\n\n366\n00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.100\nIt's very practical.\n\n367\n00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.210\nIt's very fast.\n\n368\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.790\nIt will give you the best performance,\nthe more drives the better.\n\n369\n00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.370\nRaid 0 works great for pretty much\neverything, operating system, database,\n\n370\n00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.340\ntransaction logs, page file,\nit optimizes reads, it optimizes rights,\n\n371\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.690\nit's great for everything.\n\n372\n00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.190\nIt's just not redundant and so\na lot of people don't use it.\n\n373\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:59.608\nIf we want redundancy, our first\noption is RAID 1, RAID 1 is mirroring.\n\n374\n00:17:59.608 --> 00:18:05.210\nWith RAID 1, you write to one disk and\nit clones it to another disk.\n\n375\n00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:09.059\nSo here you'll see where I've written\nthe one disk block 1, block 2, block 3 and\n\n376\n00:18:09.059 --> 00:18:11.650\nthen those blocks just get\ncloned over to my other disk.\n\n377\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.610\nBlock 1, block 2, block 3.\n\n378\n00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.080\nIf the first disk fails, I got a second\ndisk and all my data is there.\n\n379\n00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.080\nIt's great.\n\n380\n00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.020\nRight?\n\n381\n00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.220\nWell, here's the thing about RAID 1,\n\n382\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:25.202\nrather mirrors, it doesn't really\nhelp you as far as performance.\n\n383\n00:18:25.202 --> 00:18:27.630\nWhen I write my data,\nwhat do I have to do?\n\n384\n00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.880\nI have it write it twice, right?\n\n385\n00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.080\nI write to one disk and\nI have write to the other one.\n\n386\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.180\nIt kind of hurts a little bit, right?\n\n387\n00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.680\nBut usually your RAID\ncontroller does that.\n\n388\n00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.680\nIt's on your hardware, so\nyou don't even notice it.\n\n389\n00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.555\nSo when you write to your disk, it's the\nsame as if you were writing to one disk.\n\n390\n00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:45.270\nAnd when you read from it, same thing,\nyou're reading from one disk.\n\n391\n00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.320\nSo you're really don't\nget any improvements.\n\n392\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.530\nRAID 0 was all about performance,\nRAID 1 is all about redundancy.\n\n393\n00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.500\nIf I'm just looking to get redundancy,\nI can get RAID 1.\n\n394\n00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.852\nIt will not change my performance at all.\n\n395\n00:18:56.852 --> 00:18:57.450\nMy performance,\n\n396\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.590\nmy system will be the same, assuming\nI have a hardware RAID controller.\n\n397\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.930\nIf you have a software RAID,\n\n398\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.900\nif you're just doing software\nRAID instead of hardware, don't.\n\n399\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.670\nIt sounds funny when we say that,\nbut software RAID is designed for\n\n400\n00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.620\nworkstations.\n\n401\n00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.750\nOn a server,\nsoftware RAID kills your throughput.\n\n402\n00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.600\nWhen you're writing to the disk,\nthe CPU has to get involved.\n\n403\n00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.830\nSo now you're moving\nstorage through your CPU.\n\n404\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.050\nIt's terrible for performance.\n\n405\n00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.020\nDon't do it on a server.\n\n406\n00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.500\nSoftware RAID is a bad idea.\n\n407\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.350\nBut hardware RAID,\nyou don't even notice it.\n\n408\n00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.580\nIt all happens in hardware.\n\n409\n00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.630\nIt moves right through the disk,\ngreat solution.\n\n410\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.240\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n411\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.610\nRAID 1 doesn't necessary seem\nlike the greatest thing, right?\n\n412\n00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.920\nWell, there are sometimes\nwhere it's useful.\n\n413\n00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.040\nIt's useful when you only\nhave one person writing.\n\n414\n00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.680\nSo, when are times that we\nonly have one person writing?\n\n415\n00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.640\nWell, there's things like our page file.\n\n416\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.960\nWho writes the page file?\n\n417\n00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.610\nYour operating system.\n\n418\n00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.080\nNo software is allowed to\ndirectly touch the page file.\n\n419\n00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.110\nIt all has to go through\nthe operating system, and\n\n420\n00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.800\nthen the OS writes to the page file.\n\n421\n00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.940\nSo is the OS ever trying to write to more\nthan one place in the page file at a time?\n\n422\n00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.670\nNo.\n\n423\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.510\nIt does it all in serial.\n\n424\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.830\nSo, when you have something like that,\nRAID 1 is really handy.\n\n425\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.640\nSo I'll oftentimes use RAID 1 for the\ndrives where I store my operating system,\n\n426\n00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.850\nand the drives where I store my page file,\nand a lot of times I'll use it for\n\n427\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.670\nthe files where I store my\ntransactions logs also.\n\n428\n00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:19.170\nTransaction logs can be write-heavy,\nbut it's just one\n\n429\n00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.610\nservice that's writing to it, so you don't\nget a lot of write contention for it.\n\n430\n00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.060\nAnd so it works great for those.\n\n431\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.800\nSo, for your OS, for\nyour transaction logs, for\n\n432\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.350\nyour page file, RAID 1 can really work.\n\n433\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.300\nBut there's times where you\nwant better performance.\n\n434\n00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.340\nMaybe you've got so\nmuch incoming email that your transaction\n\n435\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.520\nlogs aren't writing fast enough on RAID 1,\nso you want something better.\n\n436\n00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.900\nBut you still want redundancy, and\nthat's where RAID 5 comes along.\n\n437\n00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.250\nRAID 5 tries to give us\na bit of a compromise.\n\n438\n00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:51.910\nA compromise between performance and\nredundancy, right?\n\n439\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.732\nWith this one, your data gets striped.\n\n440\n00:20:54.732 --> 00:20:58.400\nAnd [LAUGH] my slide is slightly\nincorrect here, let me correct this.\n\n441\n00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.390\nSo when we write our data,\nyour data gets divided into blocks.\n\n442\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:04.008\nSo let's say I've got six\nblocks of data that I write.\n\n443\n00:21:04.008 --> 00:21:06.870\nSo block 1 gets written to\nthe first drive, block 2\n\n444\n00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.830\ngets written to the second drive, and then\nparity gets written to the third drive.\n\n445\n00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.490\nAnd then my other blocks\nare just being divided up and\n\n446\n00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.800\nwritten across the drive in stripes,\nso block 1, block 2,\n\n447\n00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.310\nblock 3, block 4, block 5, block 6,\nall spread across the drives.\n\n448\n00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.870\nThen, across the drives,\n\n449\n00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:31.550\nthere's what are called parity blocks, and\nthe parity blocks are just a simple little\n\n450\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:36.380\nXOR operation that happens that allows\nus to rebuild data if we lose it.\n\n451\n00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.520\nAnd I don't wanna go too\ncrazy into the details.\n\n452\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.850\nMost of you guys probably\nalready know this, but\n\n453\n00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.490\njust that, at a high level,\nif I write a 1 to this drive, and\n\n454\n00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:48.160\nI write a 0 to this drive,\nI can add those together.\n\n455\n00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.420\n1 plus 0 is 1.\n\n456\n00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.350\n1 is an odd number.\n\n457\n00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.480\nAnd so we can make a note here\nin the parody block that says,\n\n458\n00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.770\nthe parity calculation is odd.\n\n459\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.940\nOr if it's 1 and 1, those add up to 2,\nthat's an even number.\n\n460\n00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.080\nSo I can put a note here that says\nthe parity calculation is even.\n\n461\n00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.781\nAnd then, if I lose one drive, so if one\nhard drive completely fails, I can look at\n\n462\n00:22:08.781 --> 00:22:13.160\nthe data I have, and I can look at parity\nand I can say should it be even or odd?\n\n463\n00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.730\nAnd I can use that to figure out whether\nit should've been a 1 or a 0 here.\n\n464\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.120\nI rebuild the data and\nI survive failure, right?\n\n465\n00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.850\nRAID 5 allows us to stripe,\nwhich gets more than\n\n466\n00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.260\none hard drive writing a reading,\nthat gives us a boost in performance.\n\n467\n00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.290\nAnd it allows us to recover\nfrom a single drive of failure.\n\n468\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:32.170\nAll right.\n\n469\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.290\nBut there's two problems with RAID 5.\n\n470\n00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.716\nThe first problem is whenever you write,\nyou write to the drive and\n\n471\n00:22:38.716 --> 00:22:41.500\nyou've gotta calculate parity.\n\n472\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.440\nNow there's a mathematical operation\nbeing tacked onto every write operation.\n\n473\n00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.860\nIf you have a hardware RAID controller\nit'll take care of that, but\n\n474\n00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.920\nif you're doing software\nyou're CPU's doing it.\n\n475\n00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.640\nIt's terrible for performance.\n\n476\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.570\nSo writing to RAID 5 can\nbe a little more sluggish\n\n477\n00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.530\nbecause you're having to do\nthis mathematical operation.\n\n478\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:58.730\nReads aren't affected by that.\n\n479\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.000\nWhen you do a read you don't have to read\nthe parity bit unless there's a failure so\n\n480\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.630\nyou're just reading the regular data.\n\n481\n00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.080\nBut notice how each stripe\nhas one parity block.\n\n482\n00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.300\nSo each stripe is one block\nshorter than it normally would be.\n\n483\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.227\nAnd in my example where I have\nthree drives, I can never read for\n\n484\n00:23:13.227 --> 00:23:15.090\nmore than two at a time.\n\n485\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.820\nAnd so I don't get as big of\na performance boost as I did with RAID 0.\n\n486\n00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.380\nRAID 0 gets us great performance.\n\n487\n00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.950\nRAID 5 sacrifices some of this.\n\n488\n00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.710\nThat being said, this can be really\nsuitable for a mailbox database.\n\n489\n00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:31.290\nIf you got a mailbox database, and you're\nnot really concerned about huge write\n\n490\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.620\nperformance, cuz just your transaction\nlogs are getting written to it,\n\n491\n00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.312\nthen here you can get reboosts,\nbut still have redundancy.\n\n492\n00:23:38.312 --> 00:23:40.540\nSo it's a great solution for\nyour mailbox database.\n\n493\n00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.120\nI don't like to use it though.\n\n494\n00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.790\nAnd the main reason is\nwhen you have a failure,\n\n495\n00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:48.070\nyou can still read from the disk\nwithout having to calculate parity.\n\n496\n00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.720\nAnd that means your reads\nare all gonna be slower.\n\n497\n00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.330\nSo during a failure, reads are slow.\n\n498\n00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.012\nAnd then when you put a new disk in,\n\n499\n00:23:55.012 --> 00:23:57.861\nit's gotta rebuild everything\nthat used be on that disk.\n\n500\n00:23:57.861 --> 00:23:59.201\nAnd that takes time.\n\n501\n00:23:59.201 --> 00:24:03.241\nDuring that time you could have another\ndisk fail and now you lose all your data.\n\n502\n00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:10.053\nAnd so RAID 5 has sluggish reads during\nfailure and you're at risk during failure.\n\n503\n00:24:10.053 --> 00:24:11.260\nYou can only lose one drive.\n\n504\n00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.986\nIf you lose second drive\nall you're data's gone, so\n\n505\n00:24:13.986 --> 00:24:16.600\nas a result I tend not to use\nRAID 5 if I can avoid it.\n\n506\n00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.380\nInstead, RAID 10.\n\n507\n00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.050\nRAID 10 is probably the best solution for\na mailbox database.\n\n508\n00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.510\nIf you've got a mailbox database,\nand you want great performance and\n\n509\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.770\ngreat redundancy,\nRAID 10's a great solution.\n\n510\n00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:36.060\nWhat RAID 10 does is it combines RAID 1,\nwhich is all about performance and RAID 0,\n\n511\n00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:40.840\nwhich is all about redundancy, and puts\nthe two together to create a super team.\n\n512\n00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.740\nAnd this super team's pretty amazing.\n\n513\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:46.440\nThe way it works is it\nbasically stripes your data.\n\n514\n00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:51.120\nSo here I've got block 1 written to this\ndrive, block 2 written to this drive,\n\n515\n00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.050\nblock 3 written back to the first drive,\nblock 4 to the second drive,\n\n516\n00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.960\nblock 5 to the first drive,\nblock 6 to the second drive.\n\n517\n00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.679\nSo it's striping across these disks.\n\n518\n00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.780\nBut then it mirrors the disks.\n\n519\n00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.050\nSo I've got block 1 here and block 1 here.\n\n520\n00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.580\nBlock 3 here, block 3 here.\n\n521\n00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.560\nI've got these duplicates of the data.\n\n522\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.010\nSo when we look at this,\nI've got great performance.\n\n523\n00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.770\nWhen I wanna read from this,\nI can read from multiple disks.\n\n524\n00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.700\nAnd when I write I can\nwrite to multiple disks.\n\n525\n00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.350\nAnd if I have a failure I don't\nhave to calculate parity,\n\n526\n00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.830\nI've just got another\ndisk I can read from.\n\n527\n00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.110\nThe data's already there.\n\n528\n00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.830\nSo now we get great performance\neven during a failure, and\n\n529\n00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.160\nwhen it comes time to rebuild\na disk if I have to replace one\n\n530\n00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.920\nI don't have to do\na mathematical operation.\n\n531\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.610\nI just copy the data from here.\n\n532\n00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.810\nSo it rebuilds way\nfaster than RAID 5 does.\n\n533\n00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.430\nRAID 10 is great.\n\n534\n00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.420\nNow, it does have its negatives, though.\n\n535\n00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.710\nIt's expensive.\n\n536\n00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.490\nI'm wasting 50% of my disks.\n\n537\n00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.800\nHalf my disks are dedicated to the mirror.\n\n538\n00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.910\nSo I have to buy drives.\n\n539\n00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.620\nNow that used to be a big problem.\n\n540\n00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.200\nToday hard drives are cheap, right?\n\n541\n00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.290\nIt's not expensive.\n\n542\n00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.600\nThe only expensive part is making sure\nyou have enough drive ports these days.\n\n543\n00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.110\nSo we can stack 14, 30,\n100 hard drives, and get\n\n544\n00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.320\nreally amazing RAID 10 arrays built out\nof that, and get some great performance.\n\n545\n00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.190\nSo when we start to divide our server up,\nwhen we say,\n\n546\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:14.210\nall right I've got my operating system\ndrive, I've got my page file drive,\n\n547\n00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.100\nI've got my transaction logs,\nand I got my mailbox database.\n\n548\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.850\nHow do I wanna divide that up?\n\n549\n00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.670\nA lot of times I'll do RAID 1 mirroring\nfor the operating system, and\n\n550\n00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:28.120\nRAID 1 mirroring for the page file.\n\n551\n00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.360\nAnd then if it's a small or\nmedium environment, I'll do RAID 1 for\n\n552\n00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.920\nthe transaction logs, and\nRAID 5 for the mailbox database.\n\n553\n00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.560\nIf it's a large environment, or\n\n554\n00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.570\njust an environment that really cares\nabout performance and has a ton of money,\n\n555\n00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:43.670\nthen I'll do RAID 10 for the transaction\nlogs and RAID 10 for the mailbox database.\n\n556\n00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.540\nIt all comes down to\nperformance at that point.\n\n557\n00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.400\nBut these are things\nthat we have to chose.\n\n558\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.850\nSo in my example where I started moving\nmy mailbox database around to other\n\n559\n00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:56.640\nhard drives, these hard drives,\nsome of them might be RAID 5,\n\n560\n00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.110\nthey might be RAID 10,\nthey might be RAID 1.\n\n561\n00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.570\nThat's gonna impact performance.\n\n562\n00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:04.610\nAnd we need to understand that so\nwe put our data where it really belongs,\n\n563\n00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:06.810\nwhere it's really gonna get\nus the best performance.\n\n564\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.050\nBecause on your system,\nyour hard drive is the slowest part.\n\n565\n00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.010\nSo reading and\nwriting that mailbox database,\n\n566\n00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.630\nthat's what's gonna make your\nExchange server fast or slow.\n\n567\n00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.900\nAnd it's all about disk\ntuning to provide that.\n\n568\n00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.442\nSo definitely important stuff that you\nwanna make sure that you're aware of.\n\n569\n00:27:20.442 --> 00:27:23.290\n>> All right, we're gonna talk about\nredundancy in another episode too.\n\n570\n00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.490\nWe might maintain more than one copy\nof our database which can help in\n\n571\n00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.900\nsome scenarios as far as performance too.\n\n572\n00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.260\nBut what you do on the disk,\nthat's what's really important.\n\n573\n00:27:32.722 --> 00:27:34.960\nAll right, well that's about it for\nthis episode.\n\n574\n00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.670\nSo in this segment we got a chance\nto see how to tune our disks and\n\n575\n00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.880\nsome of the different options there for\nrearranging where our mailbox database and\n\n576\n00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.310\ntransaction log files go.\n\n577\n00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.620\nTo really create that optimal performance\ninside of Microsoft Exchange.\n\n578\n00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.980\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwrap this one up right there.\n\n579\n00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:53.595\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n580\n00:27:53.595 --> 00:27:58.780\n[NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:15.381\nand welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:16.368\nI'm your host,\n\n5\n00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:21.050\nDon Pezet, back again with another\nepisode of Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.580\nAnd this is a fun one because\nwe're going to be talking about\n\n7\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.320\npublic folders in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.710\nAnd let me tell you,\nI've worked with Exchange a long time and\n\n9\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.870\nI remember when I was teaching\na Microsoft Exchange 2000 course.\n\n10\n00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.990\nThis was 15 years ago.\n\n11\n00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.430\nAnd I had to tell all my students, hey,\n\n12\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.730\nif you guys are using public folders,\nyou need to move away from them.\n\n13\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.400\nMicrosoft is ending support for them.\n\n14\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.560\nYou need to get away from public folders.\n\n15\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.630\nBut there was this huge public outcry,\nand so when Exchange 2003 came out,\n\n16\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.090\nMicrosoft said, well,\nwe're going to keep public folders for\n\n17\n00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.060\nnow, but\neverybody needs to get away from them.\n\n18\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.540\nAnd then Exchange 2007, well,\nwe'll keep those public folders, but\n\n19\n00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.550\neveryone needs to get away from them.\n\n20\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.140\nAnd then Exchange 2010 and now Exchange\n2013 and we still have public folders.\n\n21\n00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.610\nLet me tell you guys,\nthey're not going anywhere.\n\n22\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.930\nIt's been the thing that Microsoft has\nsaid all this time, they're going away,\n\n23\n00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.120\nthey're going away.\n\n24\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.500\nNah, they're still here.\n\n25\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.260\nAnd let me tell you what's going on.\n\n26\n00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.528\nBack in the older versions of Exchange,\nreally all the way up through Exchange\n\n27\n00:01:17.528 --> 00:01:21.660\n2010, public folders were\na special type of database.\n\n28\n00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.300\nIf you've never worked\nwith public folders,\n\n29\n00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.040\nbasically what it was was like\na file system inside of Exchange.\n\n30\n00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.130\nNormally Microsoft Exchange\nis an email program.\n\n31\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.170\nWe send emails back and\nforward to people and\n\n32\n00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.520\nit stores them as emails\nin the email database.\n\n33\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.210\nEven when you create calendar items and\n\n34\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.730\ntasks, in the background they're\nreally being stored as emails.\n\n35\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.600\nIt's all just kinda emails in a mailbox.\n\n36\n00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.750\nWell, public folders weren't like that.\n\n37\n00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.480\nThere was a special database, and\nwhen you created a public folder and\n\n38\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.610\nyou threw files in there, well,\nit was going into this special database.\n\n39\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.190\nAnd Microsoft has other products\nthat do a better job of that.\n\n40\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.240\nExchange is not a very good file server.\n\n41\n00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.980\nThis was a feature that was\nadded 20 years ago that\n\n42\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.250\nwas really just designed as a temporary\nthing to compete with Novell Groupware,\n\n43\n00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.700\nand now that's not\nreally an issue anymore.\n\n44\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.170\nSo why do we even still have it?\n\n45\n00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.150\nWell, Microsoft says you should\nbe moving over to SharePoint.\n\n46\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.810\nMicrosoft SharePoint's a better\nplace to put your files and\n\n47\n00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.020\nyou can get at your data that way.\n\n48\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.600\nDon't put it in Exchange, right?\n\n49\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.510\nGreat.\n\n50\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.560\nBut a lot of people still\nuse public folders.\n\n51\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.620\nThey want that access.\n\n52\n00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.510\nThey want their end users to be able\nto launch Microsoft Outlook and be\n\n53\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.580\nable to browse into their inbox, and then\nbe able to browse into a public folder and\n\n54\n00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.480\naccess reports and\nother things all in one place.\n\n55\n00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.050\nSo what Microsoft did is in Exchange 2013,\nthey said, all right,\n\n56\n00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.680\nhere's what we're gonna do.\n\n57\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.190\nInstead of trying to get\nrid of public folders,\n\n58\n00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.960\nthat's never gonna happen,\nlet's just change them.\n\n59\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.800\nLet's make it where public folders\nare stored like emails, and\n\n60\n00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.660\nthen we don't have this separate special\nmagical database we have to deal with.\n\n61\n00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.350\nIt's just a regular old mailbox that's\nstored just like everything else.\n\n62\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.420\nAnd that way our database availability\ngroups work, our replications, our\n\n63\n00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.940\nbackups, our restores, all that works like\nnormal and it's not a special database.\n\n64\n00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.130\nAnd that's really what Microsoft\nwas trying to get away from anyway.\n\n65\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.550\nSo in 2013 they fixed that.\n\n66\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.510\nSo Exchange 2013,\n\n67\n00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.880\nour public folders are really just\nstored in a mailbox in the back-end, and\n\n68\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.150\nit's right along as a regular mailbox\ndatabase would be, and it's no big deal.\n\n69\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.310\nSo they're actually kind\nof pleasant to work with.\n\n70\n00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.180\nLet's take a look at how it works out.\n\n71\n00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.420\nSo here I am in my Exchange admin center.\n\n72\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.600\nAnd I know if I go down here to my\nservers, I can go over to databases and\n\n73\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.390\nI can see my mailbox databases.\n\n74\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.950\nAnd in previous versions of Exchange you\nalso had your public folder databases.\n\n75\n00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.320\nBut I don't have that.\n\n76\n00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.050\nI do have my public\nfolders link over here and\n\n77\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.660\nnotice instead of public folder databases\nI have public folder mailboxes.\n\n78\n00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.140\nNow to the end user they're not\ngonna notice the difference.\n\n79\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.960\nDoesn't mean a single thing to them.\n\n80\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.460\nBut to us as the admins, it is.\n\n81\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.900\nIt's a mail box, it's not a database.\n\n82\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.830\nSo two big benefits of that.\n\n83\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.540\nOne, we're not having to support\na completely separate database.\n\n84\n00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.400\nAnd two, any redundancy that we've\nset up for our mailbox databases now\n\n85\n00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.600\napplies to the public folders too, so we\ndon't have to have a separate replication.\n\n86\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.370\nIt makes our job so much easier but\nit is different, so I want to show you\n\n87\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.480\nguys how this works and how it kinda gets\nset up, so you get a chance to see this.\n\n88\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.850\nIt is important to make sure that\nyou understand the differences.\n\n89\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.430\nYou might be tempted when you get in here\nto just start creating folders right here.\n\n90\n00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.250\nIt's got it where you can hit\nthe plus sign and start to create it.\n\n91\n00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.100\nBut you'll notice there's\na little warning here, and\n\n92\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.270\nit says,\nbefore you create a public folder,\n\n93\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.270\nplease make sure that you created\nat least one public folder mailbox.\n\n94\n00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.260\nYou have to have a mailbox\nto store this stuff in.\n\n95\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.210\nOtherwise you can't create the folders.\n\n96\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.610\nAnd that's why I've got this other option\nhere, the public folder mailboxes.\n\n97\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.950\nNow for most companies you're\nonly gonna need one mailbox.\n\n98\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.630\nThe first mailbox you create is what's\ncalled the primary public folder mailbox\n\n99\n00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.860\nand it's a read-write copy of your data.\n\n100\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.530\nIf you create any more mailboxes, they're\nsecondary mailboxes and they're read only.\n\n101\n00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.561\nYou can't write to them.\n\n102\n00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:54.130\nNow why would I want that?\n\n103\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.400\nWhy would I want read-only\ncopies of the data?\n\n104\n00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.080\nThat's kinda pointless, isn't it?\n\n105\n00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.800\nWell, it's not, for redundancy.\n\n106\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.680\nIf I want to store a copy of my public\nfolders on a server here in Gainesville,\n\n107\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.940\nFlorida, and I want to store another\ncopy in London, England, well,\n\n108\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.280\nit's kind of difficult to have a writable\ncopy of a mailbox in two different places.\n\n109\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.800\nBut I could have a writable copy here and\nput a readable copy in London.\n\n110\n00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.080\nAnd that way, any of my users over there\nin England could access it locally over\n\n111\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.920\nthere, access and read the data.\n\n112\n00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.690\nAnd only when they change data would\nit need to come to the server here.\n\n113\n00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.880\nSo that gives us a lot better performance\ncuz most people are just reading data.\n\n114\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.910\nWrites are far less frequent\ninside of a public folder.\n\n115\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.730\nSo we can create multiple mailboxes for\nredundancy.\n\n116\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.470\nBut for most of us we just need the one.\n\n117\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.070\nWe create it and then we'll be\nable to use that to set things up.\n\n118\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.530\nSo let's see that here in action.\n\n119\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.710\nSo I'm going to start by creating\nmy first public folder mailbox.\n\n120\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.971\nAnd so I need to give it a name.\n\n121\n00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:50.943\nI'm just going to call mine my Public\nFolder Mailbox because I'm not terribly\n\n122\n00:05:50.943 --> 00:05:51.880\ncreative.\n\n123\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.020\nBut if I was going to be putting\nthis in a different country,\n\n124\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.380\nI might call this one my public\nfolder replica London or\n\n125\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.510\npublic folder replica Paris, and\nthat way I'd just know where it's tied to.\n\n126\n00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.870\nAnd then right here you can specify\nthe organizational unit and\n\n127\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.150\nthe AD that this mailbox will be a part\nof, and then the mailbox database.\n\n128\n00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.810\nHere's how we pick where it's gonna be.\n\n129\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.410\nI can pick a mailbox database\nright here in Florida, or\n\n130\n00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.210\nI can pick a mailbox database\nthat's on a server in London.\n\n131\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.150\nI'm picking which database\nit's gonna reside in.\n\n132\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.520\nAnd I can always move it later on.\n\n133\n00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.030\nYou can move mailboxes\nfrom database to database.\n\n134\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.797\nSo we can change our mind\npretty easily after the fact.\n\n135\n00:06:24.797 --> 00:06:28.085\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Browse in the mailbox database and\n\n136\n00:06:28.085 --> 00:06:30.080\njust choose one of my databases here.\n\n137\n00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.948\nI'll go with my default\ndatabase on this one.\n\n138\n00:06:31.948 --> 00:06:33.490\nI'm not gonna pick an OU.\n\n139\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.340\nThat just means it'll\ngo to the default OU.\n\n140\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.310\nYou could browse and\npick one if you wanted.\n\n141\n00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.960\nIf you leave them empty it\njust goes to the defaults.\n\n142\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.650\nAll right, so that's gonna get my\npublic folder mailbox created.\n\n143\n00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.810\nThis is what's replacing the old way\nwhere I go and create a database.\n\n144\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.380\nNow it's just using the existing mailbox\ndatabase and parking this mailbox in it.\n\n145\n00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.430\nOnce I've got that,\nnow I can go to my public folders and\n\n146\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.250\nI can start to work with this.\n\n147\n00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.700\nNow you actually do have\none folder by default.\n\n148\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.290\nIt's the root.\n\n149\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.010\nSee this little slash right here?\n\n150\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.390\nThat's letting me know that I'm\nin the root of my public folder.\n\n151\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.530\nAnd I can start to create subfolders\nunderneath it to store data.\n\n152\n00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.600\nAnd the way you see this\nused most commonly is we\n\n153\n00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.370\ncreate departmental folders.\n\n154\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.830\nSo I might come in here and create\na folder called Sales for my salespeople.\n\n155\n00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.160\nAnd then under Sales I might\ncreate Marketing or other ones.\n\n156\n00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.149\nYou just start to kinda\nbranch these things out.\n\n157\n00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.210\nSo I got Sales, I've got Marketing,\nand I start creating folders for\n\n158\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.480\neach of these different organizations.\n\n159\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.400\nYou can create subfolders\nunderneath them too.\n\n160\n00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.030\nSo maybe you like to have your public\nfolders broken down by region, and\n\n161\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.930\nthen inside of a region you have sales and\nmarketing, or whatever.\n\n162\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.740\nOr maybe inside of sales, I wanna break\nthat up by region or state, however it is.\n\n163\n00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.860\nSo under Sales I might\ncreate a new folder.\n\n164\n00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.300\nAnd I'm just going to click on Sales and\nsee how my path has changed?\n\n165\n00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.921\nI'm now inside of that Sales folder.\n\n166\n00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:56.101\nAnd I can hit plus.\n\n167\n00:07:56.101 --> 00:08:01.821\nI'm going to add in,\nmaybe I'll do US sales.\n\n168\n00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:05.908\nAnd I'll add another folder for maybe\nlike U.K. sales or Canada, whoever you\n\n169\n00:08:05.908 --> 00:08:10.130\nknow start adding your various countries\nwho've got the folders that are there.\n\n170\n00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.608\nWhen I've got those,\nif I go back up to my root, right?\n\n171\n00:08:13.608 --> 00:08:16.820\nAnd you can just hit this little\narrow to jump back to your root.\n\n172\n00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.050\nSee I've got Marketing and Sales and\nunder Sales it says has sub-folders yes.\n\n173\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.735\nI can tell that it does have sub-folders.\n\n174\n00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:25.000\nAnd if I browse in I'll see those.\n\n175\n00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.930\nAll right,\nnow why bother creating sales folders?\n\n176\n00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.500\nI mean subfolders.\n\n177\n00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.350\nThe only reason to create\nsubfolders is for permissions.\n\n178\n00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.800\nI can set different permissions on these\nfolders to dictate who's allowed to\n\n179\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.220\nread data, who's allowed to write data,\nyou know, who's allowed to use this stuff.\n\n180\n00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.310\nSo for example, my U.S., I might want to\nlimit that just to my users who are in\n\n181\n00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:50.160\nthe U.S., or limit the U.K. to users who\nare just in the U.K. So, I might go up\n\n182\n00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.450\nhere to my recipients, and go to groups\nand start creating some groups, right?\n\n183\n00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:00.670\nI might create a security\ngroup called Sales,\n\n184\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.940\nwhich will be like all of my\nsales departments, right?\n\n185\n00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.260\nSo I can go in and\ncreate one of those, and\n\n186\n00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:13.010\nthen I might create other groups like U.K.\nSales.\n\n187\n00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:18.860\nAnd I'll give it an alias, and\n\n188\n00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.250\nthen I can create U.S.\nSales and so on, right?\n\n189\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:27.280\nAnd when I start to create this hierarchy,\nI can use for\n\n190\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.290\nassigning permissions and really get\nsome neat effects out of this, right?\n\n191\n00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:35.250\nI'm gonna take this sales group,\njust my overall sales,\n\n192\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.290\nright, and I can go down and\nI can take the members and\n\n193\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.740\nI can add in each of those\nother groups that I just made.\n\n194\n00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.210\nU.K. Sales, U.S. Sales.\n\n195\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.750\nI'm gonna add these in here.\n\n196\n00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.000\nSo now when I hire an employee,\nif I put him in the U.K.\n\n197\n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.470\nSales group they'll also be in the Sales\ngroup, he'll be in both, right?\n\n198\n00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.030\nSo I'm starting kind of to build\nthat hierarchy for my permissions.\n\n199\n00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.960\nAnd now if I jump back\ndown to my public folders,\n\n200\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.640\nI can start to set permissions that way.\n\n201\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.170\nSo under public folders,\nI can go back up to my root.\n\n202\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.930\nAnd I can take Sales, right here, and\n\n203\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.210\non the right side you'll see this link\nwhere it says folder permissions.\n\n204\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.760\nIt's kinda tiny,\nit's easy to miss that one.\n\n205\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.770\nBut it's folder permissions,\nand I can hit manage, and\n\n206\n00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.510\nnow I can dictate who's\nallowed to use this.\n\n207\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.360\nSo I might say, all right, for\n\n208\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.980\nthe Sales folder,\nI only want sales people getting in there.\n\n209\n00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.960\nSo I'm gonna hit add, and I'm going to\nbrowse, and I'm going to find my Sales.\n\n210\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.524\nThis is going to be all of sales,\nnot just U.K.,\n\n211\n00:10:27.524 --> 00:10:31.630\nnot just U.S., all of sales is going to\nbe able to get into this sales folder.\n\n212\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.340\nAnd then I pick the permissions.\n\n213\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.180\nNow the permissions here\nare a lot different than the file\n\n214\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.050\npermissions that you find in Windows.\n\n215\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.985\nThese are based more on like rolls, right?\n\n216\n00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:42.700\nThey're roles that people perform.\n\n217\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.660\nAnd so they've got these levels.\n\n218\n00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.760\nReviewer.\n\n219\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.560\nA reviewer is somebody\nwho would just read data.\n\n220\n00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.760\nA contributor.\n\n221\n00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.610\nThat's somebody who would add data, right?\n\n222\n00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.120\nContributing information.\n\n223\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.590\nA non-editing author.\n\n224\n00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.340\nThat would be somebody who can\ncreate their own data, but\n\n225\n00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.020\nnot edit somebody else's data.\n\n226\n00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.170\nYou've got author, just somebody\nwho can create their own data.\n\n227\n00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.170\nAnd editor,\nsomebody who can edit anybody's data.\n\n228\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.350\nA publishing author.\n\n229\n00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.120\nAnd you'll see each of\nthese different ones.\n\n230\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.000\nAnd if you're not familiar with these\nterms, they don't mean a whole lot to you,\n\n231\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.670\nso they also give you the option of just\ncoming in here and check what you want.\n\n232\n00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.760\nCan they create items?\n\n233\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.570\nCan they read?\n\n234\n00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.280\nCan they create subfolders?\n\n235\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.620\nWhat exactly can they do?\n\n236\n00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:26.350\nAnd so I might wanna say the sales\ngroup is really just able to read and\n\n237\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.510\nview the folder and that's it, right?\n\n238\n00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.810\nThey can see it.\n\n239\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.480\nAnd that's the end of it.\n\n240\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.960\nThey can't create items,\nthey can't create sub-folders or whatever.\n\n241\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.910\nSo I can specify that and put it in here.\n\n242\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.600\nOr maybe I want them to have everything.\n\n243\n00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.400\nSo I want them to be able to\njust do everything in here, so\n\n244\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.330\nI might flag them as owner.\n\n245\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.030\nThat gives them everything.\n\n246\n00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.210\nBut there's probably limits,\n\n247\n00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.550\nI probably don't want them to\nbe able to delete everything.\n\n248\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:51.590\nI probably don't want them to be able to\nmaybe, like delete other people's stuff.\n\n249\n00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.380\nSo we probably want limits there.\n\n250\n00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.912\nBut we'll just kind of tweak\nthat based on our needs.\n\n251\n00:11:55.912 --> 00:11:58.880\nAll right, so now I've set these\npermissions to the parent.\n\n252\n00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.020\nAnd see how it's got the option where I\ncan trickle those down to the children,\n\n253\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.470\nthe sub-folders.\n\n254\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.770\nI could do that, but I don't want to.\n\n255\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.620\nIn my case, I'm gonna save this.\n\n256\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.620\nSo it's only gonna apply\nto the Sales folder.\n\n257\n00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:15.040\nAnd then I'm gonna go into the Sales\nfolder, and I can tweak these.\n\n258\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.540\nI can take the U.K.\nfolder, and I'll manage that one.\n\n259\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.860\nAnd I can add here the U.K. Sales, right?\n\n260\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.720\nAnd I might want the U.K. salespeople to\ndo whatever they want in here, right?\n\n261\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.190\nThey can be straight up owners.\n\n262\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.080\nAll right.\n\n263\n00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.400\nBut then I can add the U.S. Sales and\nmake it where they can only read.\n\n264\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.050\nRight, I don't want them\nmessing with the U.K. stuff.\n\n265\n00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.300\nThey might want to see it\nin good competition, but\n\n266\n00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.620\nnot necessarily be able to change things.\n\n267\n00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.740\nSo I might set them as\na straight up reviewer, right?\n\n268\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.320\nSo now I can really get granular with\nthe permissions on that right from here.\n\n269\n00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.220\nAnd if you're wondering why Microsoft went\ndifferent with the names of permissions\n\n270\n00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.890\nhere, It's because the end users.\n\n271\n00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.200\nIf they're the owner of a folder,\nthey can change the permissions and\n\n272\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.570\nthey've changed it in Outlook.\n\n273\n00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.640\nSo Microsoft tried to make it easy for\nthem.\n\n274\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.850\nRight?\nSimple ways to be able to manipulate this.\n\n275\n00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.010\nOn that note,\nI've said Outlook a few times.\n\n276\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.574\nPublic folders are really designed\nto work with the full version of\n\n277\n00:13:08.574 --> 00:13:09.409\nMicrosoft Outlook.\n\n278\n00:13:09.409 --> 00:13:11.666\nRight?\nSo if you're running Outlook 2013, or\n\n279\n00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.310\neven some of the earlier ones.\n\n280\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.555\nYou can connect up, and you can gain\naccess to these public folders and\n\n281\n00:13:16.555 --> 00:13:19.310\nwork with them, and\nit's got it all right there in the GUI.\n\n282\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.011\nOutlook web app?\n\n283\n00:13:22.011 --> 00:13:26.780\nWhen Exchange 2013 first came out, Outlook\nweb app couldn't access public folders.\n\n284\n00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.770\nBut in cumulative update two, or\nservice pack one, if you deploy that.\n\n285\n00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.390\nIt adds that support,\nto add in public folders to OWA,\n\n286\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.520\nso if you want to you can actually get\nto your public folders via OWA also.\n\n287\n00:13:37.892 --> 00:13:41.410\nAll right, so in my case I've got my\nfolders, I've got my permissions set.\n\n288\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.120\nIt's not ready for\nmy end users to jump in.\n\n289\n00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.700\nSo they should be able to jump in,\nsee this data, and start to work with it.\n\n290\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.700\nIf I want a replica of this data, I could\nalways jump over to my public folder\n\n291\n00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.420\nmailboxes and create more mailboxes.\n\n292\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.400\nPut them on different servers and\nnow I'll have replica's.\n\n293\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.600\nAll right, there's one other thing that I\ncan tweak in here, if I go back up here.\n\n294\n00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.140\nI've got this Sales folder that I made,\n\n295\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.890\nor you know,some of the other\nones that I created.\n\n296\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.590\nWhat are they like, U.K.\nsales, some stuff.\n\n297\n00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.840\nThese folders,\nwe can choose to mail enable them.\n\n298\n00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.780\nAll right?\n\n299\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.350\nIf you mail enable them,\n\n300\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.740\nby default people have to use\nOutlook to copy files in there.\n\n301\n00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.890\nBut if you mail enable them\nthey'll get an email address, and\n\n302\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.030\nyou can send an email to\nthe public folder and\n\n303\n00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.520\nwhatever attachments are in your email\nwill come into the public folder.\n\n304\n00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.670\nThey will become a part of that, right?\n\n305\n00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.840\nSo I might want to take like marketing and\nI want to allow people to email things\n\n306\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.510\ninto marketing, so\nI can come in here and enable that.\n\n307\n00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.430\nI'm gonna mail enable it.\n\n308\n00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.890\nAnd now it's gonna have an email\naddress that I can just send to, and\n\n309\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.400\npeople will be able to send that right\nover and be able to get access to it.\n\n310\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.490\nSo, we'll have that ability.\n\n311\n00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.430\nAnd now it's ready.\n\n312\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.930\nI can see it's empty right now,\nso there's nothing too fancy, but\n\n313\n00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:52.000\nif I go down to email address, I can see\nthe email address that was assigned to it.\n\n314\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.570\nIt's important to check that,\ncuz you might have a conflict.\n\n315\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.570\nYou might have a folder like well,\nfor example, I've got a folder\n\n316\n00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:04.000\ncalled Sales, and\nI've got a group called Sales.\n\n317\n00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.230\nSo, who has sales@lab.itv.pro.tv?\n\n318\n00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.380\nI don't know which one.\n\n319\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.299\nSo it's important to take\na look at those settings.\n\n320\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.832\nAnd then jump here under\nthe e-mail addresses,\n\n321\n00:15:13.832 --> 00:15:16.270\nsee, oh, I haven't enabled that one so\nit doesn't have it.\n\n322\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.050\nBut you can just pull one up and go into\nits settings and you'll see it right under\n\n323\n00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.220\nthat email address and you can change\nit or add more than one address.\n\n324\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.110\nBut I can send something to\nmarketing@lab.itv.pro.tv and\n\n325\n00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.860\nit'll get added to this public folder.\n\n326\n00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.220\nThere's other things\nyou can tweak in here,\n\n327\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.170\nlike you can set limits to restrict\nhow much data people can put in there.\n\n328\n00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.080\nYou don't necessarily want them to\ngo crazy and store a ton of data.\n\n329\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.970\nYou can tweak who remembers,\nwho's able to access it.\n\n330\n00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.270\nYou can also view the statistics,\nhow much data's in there right now.\n\n331\n00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.250\nIt's all done right here,\nthrough some pretty easy settings.\n\n332\n00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.380\nSo the end user's gonna fire\nup Microsoft Outlook and\n\n333\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.950\nthat's how they're gonna access these\npublic folders, so let me do that.\n\n334\n00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.900\nI'm just gonna fire it up on this machine.\n\n335\n00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.723\nI got a Windows 7 machine and\nit's already set up for my mail account.\n\n336\n00:15:54.723 --> 00:15:57.703\nNow, when you fire up Outlook,\nit defaults to email, right?\n\n337\n00:15:57.703 --> 00:15:59.384\nIt's kind of what it's designed for.\n\n338\n00:15:59.384 --> 00:16:00.862\nSo I see my email.\n\n339\n00:16:00.862 --> 00:16:02.683\nAnd I don't see anything\nabout public folders.\n\n340\n00:16:02.683 --> 00:16:03.323\nRight?\n\n341\n00:16:03.323 --> 00:16:06.520\nI see Inbox, Drafts, Sent Items,\nJunk Mail, stuff like that.\n\n342\n00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.040\nAnd I see my test email right here.\n\n343\n00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.400\nTerribly exciting.\n\n344\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.250\nBut that's about it.\n\n345\n00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.990\nI really don't see anything\nrelated to public folders, and\n\n346\n00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:14.240\nthat's because it's kind of hidden away.\n\n347\n00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.810\nNot everybody uses it, so\nMicrosoft kind of gave it lower priority.\n\n348\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.870\nDown at the bottom of my screen I've got\nMail, Calendar, People, Tasks, but if I\n\n349\n00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:26.440\nhit the ellipsis button, I'll see some\nother options and one of them is Folders.\n\n350\n00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.680\nWhen you go into Folder View,\n\n351\n00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.720\nnow you're seeing the raw\nExchange view inside of Outlook.\n\n352\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.870\nAnd so you see your inbox, and\nyou'll notice how Calendar and Contacts,\n\n353\n00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.390\nsee how it's all grouped\ntogether in folders?\n\n354\n00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.380\nI said earlier in the episode all this\nstuff is being stored on the server\n\n355\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.200\nas emails, right?\n\n356\n00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.380\nIt treats it all as email.\n\n357\n00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.350\nSo this is showing me the raw folders.\n\n358\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.570\nAnd I see it that way.\n\n359\n00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.000\nNow if I click on Calendar, I'll\nactually see my calendar, that's great.\n\n360\n00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.860\nBut, if I look at my folders, I can\nbrowse and pick which one I wanna see.\n\n361\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.110\nAnd you'll notice at the very bottom,\nthere's Public Folders.\n\n362\n00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:02.050\nAnd if I expand out Public Folders, I'll\nsee all public folders and my favorites.\n\n363\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.940\nWhich, I don't have any\nfavorites right now.\n\n364\n00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.450\nBut if I keep browsing down,\nthere's Marketing,\n\n365\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.840\nand then there's Sales, all right?\n\n366\n00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.690\nAnd under Sales I got UK and\n\n367\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:14.340\nUS, and I can start to browse in those and\nend users can start to put data in there.\n\n368\n00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.030\nAll right?\n\n369\n00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.910\nNow, how can users put data in there?\n\n370\n00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.410\nThere's a couple of different ways, right?\n\n371\n00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.450\nSo let's say I'm in the marketing\ndepartment and I wanna send some data in.\n\n372\n00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.030\nWell, I guess first I need some data.\n\n373\n00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.520\nDo I have any data laying around?\n\n374\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.080\nHere, I'll take one of\nthese sales reports and\n\n375\n00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.740\nmaybe we'll just call this,\nthis'll be my Marketing Copy.\n\n376\n00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.230\nSo it'll be some kind of marketing\nthing that I've been working on.\n\n377\n00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.610\nSo I could just drag it and drop it.\n\n378\n00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.510\nThat's one way to get the data in there,\nright?\n\n379\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.730\nSo if I want this Marketing Copy\nto be in my Marketing folder,\n\n380\n00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.680\nI can just drag it and drop it, and\nit's gonna throw it right in there.\n\n381\n00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.450\nAnd there's that Marketing Copy.rtf\nright there, all right?\n\n382\n00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.230\nBut if I have something else,\n\n383\n00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.500\nlike some kind of banner that I wanna\nsend in I could just fire up an email.\n\n384\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.520\nMaybe I'm on my cell phone, and I wanna\nadd something to that public folder and\n\n385\n00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.650\nI don't have Outlook.\n\n386\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.430\nSo I can just do a new email.\n\n387\n00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.080\nAnd see how it's got Post To Marketing?\n\n388\n00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.460\nWell, I don't even have to do it this way.\n\n389\n00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.840\nI could just jump right back out\nto my email and craft a new email.\n\n390\n00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.630\nAnd for that destination, oh,\nnow it's gonna remember me.\n\n391\n00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.180\nHere we go.\n\n392\n00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.192\nSo I can come in here and craft a new\nemail and for the destination, I could put\n\n393\n00:18:22.192 --> 00:18:26.860\nthe email address for that public folder\nwhich for me was marketing@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n394\n00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.587\nAnd I could say this is a banner\nad I've been working on and\n\n395\n00:18:31.587 --> 00:18:33.565\nI can attach that file.\n\n396\n00:18:33.565 --> 00:18:36.600\nWe'll insert that and\nI'll send it via e-mail.\n\n397\n00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.560\nAll right.\n\n398\n00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.310\nIt's gonna go to the server and the\nserver's gonna see that it's attached to\n\n399\n00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.300\nthat public folder, and\nit's gonna put it in the public folder.\n\n400\n00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:48.360\nAnd so now if I go back to my folder view,\nwhen I jump back over here,\n\n401\n00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.030\ngo down to my folders,\ngo down to Marketing.\n\n402\n00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.910\nIt may take it a moment cuz it's\ngotta process through the server and\n\n403\n00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.590\nthe hub transport rules and all that.\n\n404\n00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.040\nBut eventually that banner\nad will show up right here.\n\n405\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.910\nThere it is.\n\n406\n00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.900\nAnd now it's an attachment, right.\n\n407\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.400\nIf I drag and drop it, or if I email\nit in, either way, it's right there.\n\n408\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.210\nAnd anybody who has access to this\npublic folder can now get to that\n\n409\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.300\nbanner ad and see it.\n\n410\n00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.130\nIt's kind of like a low-feature\nversion of SharePoint.\n\n411\n00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.790\nWe can share our files there.\n\n412\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.760\nYou can't edit them in place, but you\ncan download the attachment, modify it,\n\n413\n00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.380\nupload it as a new attachment, right?\n\n414\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.770\nAnd so\nyou can kinda get that functionality.\n\n415\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:25.000\nAll right, other things we can do.\n\n416\n00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.380\nBased on your permissions,\nyou can drag and drop things in there.\n\n417\n00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.090\nThat's really the easiest way to get data\nin these Is to just come in here and\n\n418\n00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:31.730\ntake your stuff.\n\n419\n00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.980\nSo like I've got these quarterly sales\nreports and we can just drag and\n\n420\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.470\ndrop those and that's gonna throw them in.\n\n421\n00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.800\nAnd your Outlook is basically reaching out\nto the servers, uploading these files,\n\n422\n00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.080\nand they're being stored here.\n\n423\n00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.240\nNow I know they're files but\nExchange treats them like emails.\n\n424\n00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.690\nThat's why they have a name,\nthey have a subject.\n\n425\n00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.260\nThe file itself is actually an attachment,\nkinda stuck to it.\n\n426\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.230\nAnd I'm even getting a live preview.\n\n427\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:20:00.260\nThese are RTF files, Rich Text, and so\nit's rendering that Rich Text right there.\n\n428\n00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.070\nIf I had thrown a picture or something.\n\n429\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.270\nLet's see if I can.\n\n430\n00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.120\nWe'll steal a picture from the internet.\n\n431\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.950\nThis is where things get challenging,\n\n432\n00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.810\nis finding a picture\nsometimes that's not crazy.\n\n433\n00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.230\nActually I guess we could just take\none of these banner ads and [LAUGH].\n\n434\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.790\nBut if we find a picture and save it,\nwe could throw a picture in there and\n\n435\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.390\nyou get live previews of these things.\n\n436\n00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.720\nIt's kind of neat to be able to work\nwith those and manipulate them.\n\n437\n00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.658\nI'm gonna save this Microsoft logo.\n\n438\n00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:29.930\nAnd we'll just save that into my images.\n\n439\n00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.550\nAnd we'll take that and throw it in there.\n\n440\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.520\nAnd so it basically turns\nExchange into a file server.\n\n441\n00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.110\nAnd I know I said at\nthe beginning of the episode,\n\n442\n00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.810\nExchange doesn't make the greatest\nfile server in the world.\n\n443\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.020\nAnd I'm gonna stand by that one because\nit's not really what it's designed for.\n\n444\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.990\nBut you could use SharePoint,\nit does a better job or\n\n445\n00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.290\nyou could just use a file server.\n\n446\n00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.990\nThat's why we have those things.\n\n447\n00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.620\nBut here we go I can see it,\nI can see the file render right here.\n\n448\n00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.420\nAnd now I can share it with anybody\nelse that's in my department\n\n449\n00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.340\nall right inside that public folder.\n\n450\n00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.170\nSo if you've heard the news that\npublic folders are going away.\n\n451\n00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.690\nWell, they really aren't anymore.\n\n452\n00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.190\nThey've survived 15 years now of\nMicrosoft saying they're going away and\n\n453\n00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.180\nin exchange 2013, they're here to stay.\n\n454\n00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.020\nThey've been converted to mailboxes.\n\n455\n00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.300\nThey're right there in\nthe mailbox database store.\n\n456\n00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.334\nAnd that makes them\nreally low maintenance,\n\n457\n00:21:13.334 --> 00:21:16.330\nreal easy to handle and you get\nthe database availability group and\n\n458\n00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.700\nother redundancy features you\nhave with the mailbox database.\n\n459\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.580\nAll wrapped into one.\n\n460\n00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.090\nSo it's a great solution,\ndefinitely something to take advantage of.\n\n461\n00:21:24.312 --> 00:21:27.200\nAll right, well in this show we got\na chance to see what the public folders\n\n462\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.600\nare and how to implement them.\n\n463\n00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.740\nHow to get the pubic folder mailboxes\ncreated and then create the public folders\n\n464\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.330\nthemselves inside of the mailbox and get\nthat up and operational for our end users.\n\n465\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.830\nSo, that's a great place for\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n466\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.170\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n467\n00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.957\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pizet and I'll see you next time.\n\n468\n00:21:44.957 --> 00:21:49.956\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.290\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.840\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.370\nBack again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.631\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:26.540\nwe're gonna take a look at something\nthat is pretty important, address lists.\n\n8\n00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.035\nNow, address lists are something we can\neasily ignore inside of Exchange because\n\n9\n00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:31.970\nthere is a default address\nlist put in place.\n\n10\n00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.010\nAnd most people use it, and\nthey're happy with that.\n\n11\n00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.260\nAnd that's kinda the end of it.\n\n12\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.180\nBut there's a lot of power in the back end\nwhere we can customize those address lists\n\n13\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.300\nthat people overlook.\n\n14\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.580\nAnd it can really be a neat thing\nthat you can use to your advantage.\n\n15\n00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.060\nSo, let me show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n16\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.802\nIf I'm an end user,\n\n17\n00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:49.130\nI'm gonna use something like\nMicrosoft Outlook as my client.\n\n18\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.163\nAnd when I go to create a new email,\n\n19\n00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:54.630\nI have to pick who that\nemail's being sent to, right?\n\n20\n00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.280\nSo you got your To field,\nit's terribly exciting.\n\n21\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.470\nNow, we've got our own contacts, right?\n\n22\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.360\nEach end user has their own\ncontacts they keep track of, right?\n\n23\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.230\nSo I can jump down here to People.\n\n24\n00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.580\nAnd I'll start to see any\ncontacts that I have.\n\n25\n00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.180\nThose are just for me.\n\n26\n00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.210\nBut if I'm an employee in\na company with 10,000 employees,\n\n27\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.450\nshouldn't I see the other\n10,000 employees?\n\n28\n00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.025\nWell, you can.\n\n29\n00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:17.720\nThey're not in your contacts by default.\n\n30\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.142\nThis is just for your account, but,\nwe have what's called the global address\n\n31\n00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:25.490\nlist, or the GAL, G-A-L,\nglobal address list.\n\n32\n00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.920\nThat contains all of the recipients for\nour organization.\n\n33\n00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.427\nAnd when I say recipients, that means\nmailboxes, contacts, groups, distribution\n\n34\n00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:37.670\nlists, all that kind of stuff, it will\nall be in that global address list.\n\n35\n00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.300\nNow, an end user can see it even\nwhen they're crafting a new email.\n\n36\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.880\nIf I fire up a new email,\nand I come in here,\n\n37\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.200\nyou've got this Address Book\nbutton up here in the email.\n\n38\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.310\nAnd if I choose that, I start to see\nmy global address list right there.\n\n39\n00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.920\nI can drop that down and choose Contacts.\n\n40\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.133\nNow I just see the contacts on my account,\nbut I can also drop it down and\n\n41\n00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.510\nchoose Global Address List.\n\n42\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.970\nAnd I see everybody, users, groups,\nall that stuff, it shows up right here.\n\n43\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.620\nI can see it, it's available to me.\n\n44\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.890\nNow, the advantage of this is, is that\na new employee on day one, already has\n\n45\n00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.010\na complete listing of all the employees\nin the company that he can email to.\n\n46\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.430\nBut if you've got 50,000 people in\nyour organization, that's a lot, and\n\n47\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.420\nwe probably want to filter that down.\n\n48\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.470\nAnd that's where we want to customize\nthis global address list a bit, right.\n\n49\n00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.523\nAnd there's a few filters already in\nplace, right, we've got All Contacts,\n\n50\n00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.070\nAll Groups, Rooms, Users.\n\n51\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.960\nThese are ways we can filter down a bit.\n\n52\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.630\nBut what if I want to filter down to say,\njust people in the sales department?\n\n53\n00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.672\nWell, it doesn't give me\na good way to do that, and\n\n54\n00:02:38.672 --> 00:02:40.300\nin a massive organization we want that.\n\n55\n00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.480\nSo, what we'll want to do is on our\nserver, create additional address list\n\n56\n00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.930\nthat are filtered based on\ncriteria we provide, all right?\n\n57\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.130\nLet me show you how that works.\n\n58\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.570\nIt's really not that hard.\n\n59\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.160\nIf we jump back here to our\nExchange administration center,\n\n60\n00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.130\nright, so I'm gonna jump into my EAC.\n\n61\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.267\nAnd once I'm in here, you'll see all\nthe different things on the left side,\n\n62\n00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:03.930\nand in each of these are different\nkind of aspects of our company.\n\n63\n00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.010\nAnd the one I'm looking for\nis organization.\n\n64\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.690\nAnd under organization,\nyou'll see address lists, right.\n\n65\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.730\nThese are the address lists for\n\n66\n00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.590\nyour company, and you have the Default\nGlobal Address List right there.\n\n67\n00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.590\nThat's that primary one that all of\nyour users are gonna have access to, and\n\n68\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.630\nit contains every single person\nthroughout your organization, all right?\n\n69\n00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.954\nNow, the other ones that are created here,\nAll Contacts, All Groups,\n\n70\n00:03:27.954 --> 00:03:29.862\nAll Rooms, All Users, Public Folders,\n\n71\n00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:33.330\nthose other ones that are designed\nto be those simple filters.\n\n72\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.755\nMicrosoft encourages you to leave these\nalone, leave the default ones be.\n\n73\n00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:39.240\nThen if you want to create custom ones,\njust create your own.\n\n74\n00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.020\nAnd so we can add those in,\nI mentioned sales people, right?\n\n75\n00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.292\nSo, if I take a look,\nlet me go into my Active Directory,\n\n76\n00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:50.590\nwhich I have parked around here somewhere.\n\n77\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.829\nAll right, I'm gonna go into my\nActive Directory Users and Computers, and\n\n78\n00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.890\nlet's take a look at my OU structure.\n\n79\n00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.510\nSo I've got this OU called ITProTV,\nand inside of ITProTV,\n\n80\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.920\nI've got Accounting, IT,\nMarketing, Sales, right.\n\n81\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.070\nAnd say I'm in sales,\nI've got Jane Smith and John Doe.\n\n82\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.970\nI've got the UK Sales and US Sales,\nthese groups that are present.\n\n83\n00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.910\nBut me, I'm over here in IT,\nso I'm separate.\n\n84\n00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.830\nWell, if I jump back to my client, so if\nI jump back over to, whoops, there we go.\n\n85\n00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.920\nJump back over to my client.\n\n86\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.645\nWhen I went into Outlook,\nin Outlook, that new email,\n\n87\n00:04:26.645 --> 00:04:28.995\nmy Global Address List,\nit contained everybody, right?\n\n88\n00:04:28.995 --> 00:04:33.373\nSo I saw me, Don Pezet, who's in\nthe IT department, and I saw Sales,\n\n89\n00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:36.875\nUK Sales, and US Sales,\nwhich were in the sales group.\n\n90\n00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:39.215\nAnd I saw Marketing,\nwhich was in the Marketing OU.\n\n91\n00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:40.950\nIt's really the whole thing.\n\n92\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.640\nI wanna create a filter based\njust on the Sales OU, all right?\n\n93\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.800\nSo, what we do is we jump back to our EAC,\nand we create a new address list.\n\n94\n00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.898\nI'm just gonna hit the plus sign\nthere to create a new one, and\n\n95\n00:04:53.898 --> 00:04:56.170\nI'm gonna call this\nthe Sales Address List.\n\n96\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.310\nOr, I'll just call it Sales.\n\n97\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.430\nFrom there, we start to pick what\nwe want to show up, all right.\n\n98\n00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.200\nDo I want it to show all recipient\ntypes or just user mailboxes,\n\n99\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.880\njust contacts or a mixture of them, right?\n\n100\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.320\nI might not want to show\ndistribution groups.\n\n101\n00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.300\nI might just want to show users with\nExchange mailboxes or a mixture.\n\n102\n00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.220\nSo you can go through and\nkinda pick what you wanna see, or\n\n103\n00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.220\nwhat you wanna be a part of that, right?\n\n104\n00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.050\nSo, for example, I might wanna\nleave out resource mailboxes.\n\n105\n00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.380\nI don't wanna include things\nlike rooms and projectors.\n\n106\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.750\nI just want it to be people.\n\n107\n00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.080\nSo I'll say, yeah,\ngo ahead and show me users.\n\n108\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.090\nShow me contacts, show me groups.\n\n109\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.620\nBut I'll leave out those\nresource mailboxes.\n\n110\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.860\nAnd then the real important part is this\nguy right here, the add a rule, all right.\n\n111\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.550\nAdding a rule is where we dictate where\nit's gonna find this information from.\n\n112\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.290\nAnd I'll hit add a rule, and\n\n113\n00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.200\nyou can pick from a number of\ndifferent things to filter on, right.\n\n114\n00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.920\nYou've got things like the State or\nprovince, Company, Department, and\n\n115\n00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.280\nall these Custom attributes, all right.\n\n116\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.040\nThese are all coming from\nthe Active Directory.\n\n117\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.530\nIf I jump back over to my\ndomain controller, and\n\n118\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.210\nwe take somebody like me\nin the Active Directory.\n\n119\n00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.288\nIf I pull up my account, I've got\nthings like that Description, Office,\n\n120\n00:06:06.288 --> 00:06:07.860\nTelephone number.\n\n121\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.760\nAnd as we browse through here, you'll find\nother things that identify that person,\n\n122\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.630\ntheir City, their State.\n\n123\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.080\nThose are the things\nthat we could filter on.\n\n124\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.970\nSo, just show me the employees\nthat are working out of Florida.\n\n125\n00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.940\nOr just show me the employees\nthat are in England, right.\n\n126\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.540\nAnd so we can filter on that.\n\n127\n00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.240\nBut I find the most useful\nis filtering based on OU.\n\n128\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.490\nRight, and back on that list, that was the\none that showed up as Recipient container.\n\n129\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.670\nSo, if I want to filter\nby recipient container,\n\n130\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.130\nit lets me browse the Active Directory and\npick the OU that has the users I want.\n\n131\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.670\nSo, I can browse in here,\nand I can say, just Sales.\n\n132\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.936\nAnd I'll pick that, and\n\n133\n00:06:44.936 --> 00:06:49.170\nnow it's only gonna show me recipients\nthat aren't resource mailboxes, right.\n\n134\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.611\nI left that one off that are in\nthe sales OU, and when I save that,\n\n135\n00:06:53.611 --> 00:06:56.340\nit's gonna create that address list.\n\n136\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.000\nAnd now I've got this list that kinda\nbreaks that down for me, all right.\n\n137\n00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.090\nNow, notice there's\nthis Address list path.\n\n138\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.140\nBy default, every address list\nis like a parent address list.\n\n139\n00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.720\nAnd when we start to create more,\n\n140\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.240\nyou can choose to nest address\nlists underneath the other ones.\n\n141\n00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.592\nSo for example, back in Outlook when I was\nwriting that new email, when I was in my\n\n142\n00:07:17.592 --> 00:07:21.760\nAddress Book, if I drop that down,\nsee how I've got this All Address Lists?\n\n143\n00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.510\nAnd these other ones are kinda\nnested underneath it.\n\n144\n00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.440\nWe can set that up.\n\n145\n00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.520\nWe can have a parent, and\nthen children underneath it.\n\n146\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.360\nSo, I might have a Sales list,\nand then underneath it,\n\n147\n00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.174\nI might have US, UK, and so on.\n\n148\n00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:37.370\nSo kinda breaking it down that way, you\ncan nest the address lists to create that.\n\n149\n00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.640\nAll right,\nnow when I created the address list,\n\n150\n00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.340\nI did get a little warning that popped up.\n\n151\n00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.650\nAnd it's just warning me about\nhow these things get updated.\n\n152\n00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.519\nIt's telling me that I've made a change.\n\n153\n00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:50.539\nBut the address list isn't\ngonna update on its own.\n\n154\n00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:52.091\nAnd that's important to remember,\n\n155\n00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:54.800\nbecause these address lists get\nupdated on a certain interval.\n\n156\n00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.561\nAnd by default it usually doesn't\nhappen until midnight, so\n\n157\n00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:01.008\nif I want these changes to take effect\nright away I need to go ahead and push it,\n\n158\n00:08:01.008 --> 00:08:02.810\nso that's what that warning is.\n\n159\n00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.250\nI'll just say OK to that.\n\n160\n00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.370\nAnd I can see my Sales\naddress list right here, and\n\n161\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.730\nnotice in the Up to Date column,\nit says No.\n\n162\n00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.370\nIt's not unusual to see No there.\n\n163\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.780\nIf any changes have happened\nin your Active Directory and\n\n164\n00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.640\nthe address list hasn't been updated yet,\nit's gonna say that it's not up to date.\n\n165\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.160\nAnd then it brings it up to date every\nnight during your maintenance interval,\n\n166\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.220\nduring that window.\n\n167\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.220\nI think the default is midnight to 3 AM,\nso\n\n168\n00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.830\nsomewhere in that time\nit's gonna do that update.\n\n169\n00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.960\nBut we can bring it up to date on our own.\n\n170\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.170\nIf you highlight any of these lists,\n\n171\n00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.690\nyou'll see the link over\nhere that says Update and\n\n172\n00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.350\nwe can tell it to update it right now.\n\n173\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.210\nIt's just warning us that if your\naddress list is big, it can actually\n\n174\n00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.730\nkind of degrade performance on the server\nwhile it rebuilds that address list.\n\n175\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.370\nSo it's just saying here if it's\nmore than 3,000 recipients,\n\n176\n00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.770\nyou should consider\ndoing this after hours.\n\n177\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.260\nAnd they give you the PowerShell command\nright there, Update-AddressList.\n\n178\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.344\nTo be able to do that, to schedule\nit to happen at 2 AM or 5 AM or\n\n179\n00:08:56.344 --> 00:08:58.150\nsome non-peak time.\n\n180\n00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.430\nBut my address list is really small,\nso I'll go ahead and say Yes and\n\n181\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.860\nlet it build right now, and it's done.\n\n182\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.210\nAnd now I can see that it's up to date.\n\n183\n00:09:05.675 --> 00:09:07.575\nNow when you create\naddress lists like this,\n\n184\n00:09:07.575 --> 00:09:11.505\nthe end users don't necessarily see them\nright away, and that's because Outlook is\n\n185\n00:09:11.505 --> 00:09:15.365\nactually downloading these address lists\nand displaying them to them locally.\n\n186\n00:09:15.365 --> 00:09:17.835\nIf they're in Outlook web access it\nwill normally turn up right away, but\n\n187\n00:09:17.835 --> 00:09:20.372\nif they're in that Outlook\nclient it might not be there.\n\n188\n00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:23.072\nSo for example,\nif I go into my address book now and\n\n189\n00:09:23.072 --> 00:09:26.632\ndrop that down, I don't see my Sales list.\n\n190\n00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:31.292\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and exit out of\nOutlook and so we'll just close it down.\n\n191\n00:09:31.292 --> 00:09:34.162\nAnd I'm gonna give it a second.\n\n192\n00:09:34.162 --> 00:09:35.992\nOutlook doesn't always close cleanly.\n\n193\n00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:39.462\nSometimes it's still running in the\nbackground as it finishes up little tasks,\n\n194\n00:09:39.462 --> 00:09:42.810\nso I'm just gonna check my Task Manager,\nmake sure it's actually gone, and\n\n195\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.540\nthen I'll go back in.\n\n196\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.840\nSo when I go back in, it'll contact\nthe server and it should say, oh,\n\n197\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.610\nlook, I got a new address list.\n\n198\n00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.190\nAnd it should just have our sales people.\n\n199\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.680\nNow I'm using my IT technical term of\nshould which gives me a little bit of\n\n200\n00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.830\na backout if this doesn't work, but\nit should show up pretty shortly.\n\n201\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.370\nSo when I go into my address list now and\n\n202\n00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.475\nI take a look,\nI should see my Sales address list.\n\n203\n00:10:02.475 --> 00:10:03.800\nAnd I still don't, and\n\n204\n00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.180\nthat just means that Outlook hasn't\nactually downloaded that yet.\n\n205\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.770\nSo we have to give it\na moment to download.\n\n206\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.980\nSo while we're waiting on that,\nlet's take a look at something else and\n\n207\n00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.440\nthat'll pull up shortly.\n\n208\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.500\nI guess I could switch over to OWA and\nwe'd see it there.\n\n209\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.260\nI'm logged into OWA here and\nif I just craft a new email.\n\n210\n00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.350\nAnd I go into my To field for\n\n211\n00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.010\nwho I want to email,\nby default it's showing me my contacts.\n\n212\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.640\nBut if I hit the little arrows over here\nI can see everything, and sure enough,\n\n213\n00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.710\nright there at the bottom\nthere's that Sales address list.\n\n214\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.340\nAnd when I choose it, now it's just gonna\nshow me things that are in the Sales OU.\n\n215\n00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.310\nI'm not seeing me, right,\nDon Pezet, I'm in the IT department.\n\n216\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.980\nI'm not in the sales department and\nso it doesn't show it.\n\n217\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.000\nIt's now filtered and I can pick from\nthose groups that were in there and\n\n218\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.680\nwe can go from there.\n\n219\n00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.370\nNow I had a couple of users in there,\nJohn Doe and Jane Smith.\n\n220\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.750\nThey must not be mail enabled so\nthey're not showing up here in my list.\n\n221\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.420\nI can actually verify that real quick\nif I take a look at my recipients.\n\n222\n00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.610\nYeah, sure enough, they don't have\nmailboxes, but if I were to whip them up\n\n223\n00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.930\nsome mailboxes real quick, then they would\nhave that and they'd show in the list.\n\n224\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.680\nBut what we've done right here is to\ncreate that custom address list, and\n\n225\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.090\nyou can really create as\nmany of these as you need.\n\n226\n00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.910\nOrganizations might create a ton.\n\n227\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.530\nI know I've worked for companies that\ndid business in multiple states or\n\n228\n00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.740\nmultiple countries, and\n\n229\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.540\nyou might want to create address\nlists that are a little more focused.\n\n230\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.420\nIf you have 50,000 employees,\n\n231\n00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.850\nwhat are the odds of you having\nmultiple employees with the same name?\n\n232\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.140\nIt happens all the time.\n\n233\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.300\nYou might have five different John Smiths.\n\n234\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.890\nBut if you work in Florida and you know\nthe John Smith you want is in Florida\n\n235\n00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.080\nalso, wouldn't it be nice to filter\ndown to just people in Florida?\n\n236\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.380\nThat's what these custom\naddress lists let us do.\n\n237\n00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.830\nSo we can whip those up, throw them in\nplace and really have that functionality.\n\n238\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.920\nNow the end users can't do this.\n\n239\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.280\nAdministrators have to do it, and\n\n240\n00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.110\nthat's because it's done through\nthe Exchange Administration Center.\n\n241\n00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.860\nThat we have to go in here\nto our organization and\n\n242\n00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.740\nthen go into our address list to\ncustomize that and build them.\n\n243\n00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.030\nNow once you've built an address list,\nyou can change it.\n\n244\n00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.100\nIf I choose it, I can always come in\nhere and edit it, and we can go in and\n\n245\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.640\nstart to modify the address list.\n\n246\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.570\nSo if I choose to add those\nresource mailboxes back in,\n\n247\n00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.510\nit's easy to change this after the fact.\n\n248\n00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.410\nJust remember to do an update of\nthe address list after you make a change.\n\n249\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.560\nAnd if you're not sure if\nyour filter's working,\n\n250\n00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.600\nyou've got this nice little\nPreview recipients link.\n\n251\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.470\nAnd you can hit that, and it'll give you\na preview of what this list is going to\n\n252\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.030\nlook like so\nyou can then customize it some more\n\n253\n00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.682\nto really meet the needs of what it\nis that you're trying to achieve.\n\n254\n00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.190\nAll right,\nanother thing we need to be aware of is,\n\n255\n00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.220\nwell it kinda ties back to what I was\ntalking about a moment ago with Outlook.\n\n256\n00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.840\nWith Outlook, it's gonna download a copy\nof these address lists to store locally.\n\n257\n00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.990\nAnd it's checking in with the server from\ntime to time to get those updates, and\n\n258\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.040\nso it can be a little bit behind.\n\n259\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.700\nWhat it's doing is it's creating what's\ncalled an offline address book or and OAB.\n\n260\n00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.750\nAnd the OAB, it's stored on all\nof your Client Access servers.\n\n261\n00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.200\nSo your Client Access servers\nmaintain a copy of the OAB and\n\n262\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.920\nwhen Outlook goes to connect,\nit downloads a copy of it.\n\n263\n00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.420\nSo that offline address book,\nit has to be updated and refreshed and\n\n264\n00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.470\nit has to be distributed\nout to your clients.\n\n265\n00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.170\nSo it's done automatically for\nthe most part,\n\n266\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.340\nwe don't really have to worry about it,\nbut we can tweak it.\n\n267\n00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.590\nIf your organization is huge, if you\nhave hundreds of thousands of employees,\n\n268\n00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.050\nthat offline address\nbook can be kinda big.\n\n269\n00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.730\nSo you might want to create\nsmaller offline address books that\n\n270\n00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.670\nonly contain certain\naspects of your company.\n\n271\n00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.520\nSo maybe I have employees in Florida.\n\n272\n00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.250\nAnd so I only want the offline address\nbook to contain employees in Florida,\n\n273\n00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.650\nnot the rest of the world.\n\n274\n00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.440\nSo I could create custom offline\naddress books for that and\n\n275\n00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.200\ndictate where that goes.\n\n276\n00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.260\nSo that's something that we can\ncertainly do and customize that and\n\n277\n00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.870\nit definitely helps cuz it can take\nOutlook a while to get some of this stuff.\n\n278\n00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.410\nNow the offline address books,\nthey're being built automatically.\n\n279\n00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.304\nI believe the default is at 5 AM.\n\n280\n00:13:44.304 --> 00:13:46.930\nAt 5 AM every day it builds\nthese offline address books and\n\n281\n00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.700\nit stores them on the hard drive\non your Client Access server.\n\n282\n00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.590\nSo it's just inside of the Exchange\ndirectory where they're stored.\n\n283\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.200\nAnd we can actually kinda browse and\nfind some of them.\n\n284\n00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:02.605\nHere, let me take my Client Access server\nhere and, actually, you know what?\n\n285\n00:14:02.605 --> 00:14:04.765\nI think we can find it on\nour Mailbox server too,\n\n286\n00:14:04.765 --> 00:14:06.835\nlet's see if we can find\none of these real quick.\n\n287\n00:14:06.835 --> 00:14:08.795\nSo here I am on my Mailbox server.\n\n288\n00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:11.695\nThe Mailbox server's what actually builds\nit, it's where the mailboxes reside,\n\n289\n00:14:11.695 --> 00:14:14.705\nand then it gets stored on\nthe Client Access server too.\n\n290\n00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:22.228\nSo if I browse into C: > Program Files\n> Microsoft > Exchange Server > V15.\n\n291\n00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:27.660\nAnd then ClientAccess because it's\npart of that client access role, and\n\n292\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.030\nthen we'll get in there.\n\n293\n00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.650\nWhat you'll find is in that folder there\nwill be another folder called OAB, and\n\n294\n00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.170\nthat's where the offline\naddress book is stored.\n\n295\n00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:38.126\nAnd apparently mine is going to\ntake it's time to browse in there.\n\n296\n00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:40.990\nLet me do this on the Client Access\nserver while we wait.\n\n297\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.270\nSo this is another one of those\nexamples where the roles work together.\n\n298\n00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.140\nThe Mailbox server's\nwhat's building it and\n\n299\n00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.040\nthe Client Access server\nis what's serving it up.\n\n300\n00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.240\nSo we should be able to\nfind that in both places.\n\n301\n00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.346\nSo if I get too impatient on one I\nshould be able to find it on the other.\n\n302\n00:14:56.913 --> 00:14:59.580\nAnd let's see, not seeing it there.\n\n303\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.260\nHere we go.\n\n304\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.550\nSo back in my mail server it's got\nthat OAB, and if I browse into that\n\n305\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.890\nwe'll see the offline address book,\nif it's been created.\n\n306\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.130\nOn a clean install, your offline address\nbook might not have been created yet\n\n307\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.792\nif you just finished your install.\n\n308\n00:15:11.792 --> 00:15:12.980\nBut mine's been running for\n\n309\n00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.260\na little while and so\nI can see I've got a web.config, Temp.\n\n310\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.630\nI've got a U ID folder.\n\n311\n00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.370\nAnd this is the offline address book.\n\n312\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.770\nIt's not terribly large for mine.\n\n313\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.259\nMine's pretty small because I\ndon't have a lot of contacts, so\n\n314\n00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:29.190\nthere's not really a whole heck of\na lot for me to see in this one.\n\n315\n00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.290\nBut as your organization grows, what\nyou'll see is these things start to grow\n\n316\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.680\nalso, and\nyou end up with a large amount of data.\n\n317\n00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.750\nHere's my actual offline address\nbook right here, oab.xml.\n\n318\n00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.360\nIt's just an XML document, and\nmine's 21K, but as I add employees,\n\n319\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.310\nthat can grow, and\nit can become several megabytes.\n\n320\n00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.870\nNow that's not a big deal, but\n\n321\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.420\nif you have a massive organization\nit can grow to be 100 megs.\n\n322\n00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.421\nIt can grow to be even bigger.\n\n323\n00:15:52.421 --> 00:15:57.226\nAnd that can be a problem if you have\nusers on low bandwidth connections, so\n\n324\n00:15:57.226 --> 00:16:00.061\nthat's where we might\nneed to dice this up.\n\n325\n00:16:00.061 --> 00:16:00.781\nAll right.\n\n326\n00:16:00.781 --> 00:16:06.243\nNow, when we go to push this out, if we\nwanna create custom offline address lists,\n\n327\n00:16:06.243 --> 00:16:09.300\nthey don't give you a way\nto do that in the GUI.\n\n328\n00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.356\nSo, I can't do it from the Exchange\nadministration center,\n\n329\n00:16:12.356 --> 00:16:14.136\nI have to do it from the PowerShell.\n\n330\n00:16:14.136 --> 00:16:16.553\nAnd in the PowerShell,\nwe can build these custom address list,\n\n331\n00:16:16.553 --> 00:16:18.980\nthese offline address lists,\nand push them out.\n\n332\n00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.500\nAnd then as far as assigning the offline\naddress list, what you do is you create\n\n333\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.790\nthese offline address list policies and\nthat dictates who it applies to.\n\n334\n00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:30.650\nBut one of the easiest ways to do it is\nto do it based on your mailbox database.\n\n335\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.700\nIf I go down here to my servers, and\n\n336\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.770\nI go to my databases,\nI'll see my mailbox databases.\n\n337\n00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.254\nAnd see how I've created\na Sales mailbox database?\n\n338\n00:16:40.254 --> 00:16:42.425\nThat's where my Sales\nemployees are going to be.\n\n339\n00:16:42.425 --> 00:16:46.612\nIf I edit that mailbox database,\nyou've actually got the option in\n\n340\n00:16:46.612 --> 00:16:50.080\nhere to dictate what offline\naddress book they use.\n\n341\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.620\nSo I can go here to client settings and\nI can browse and choose.\n\n342\n00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.766\nAnd then anybody who's mailbox I stick\nin this mailbox database will use that\n\n343\n00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.300\nparticular offline address book, alright.\n\n344\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.420\nBut I need to build it first.\n\n345\n00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.700\nI've only got one offline address book\nright now and that's the default.\n\n346\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.780\nI need to create another one just for\nSales, alright.\n\n347\n00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.860\nSo I'm gonna jump over to my\nclient access server here, and\n\n348\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.230\nI'm gonna whip up the Exchange Shell.\n\n349\n00:17:18.191 --> 00:17:22.050\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna try and\nlaunch the Exchange Management Shell.\n\n350\n00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:22.870\nThere we go.\n\n351\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.630\nAnd let me bump my font size up on this\n\n352\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:25.980\nbecause I know it'll\nbe kinda hard to read.\n\n353\n00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.399\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\njust gonna whip up a real quick\n\n354\n00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.550\ncustom offline address book,\nsoon as that one loads.\n\n355\n00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.680\nSo, I do have to do it from\nthe PowerShell, which kind of stinks,\n\n356\n00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.710\nbut you don't have to do\nit all that often, right,\n\n357\n00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.230\nhow often are you really\ncreating offline address books?\n\n358\n00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.630\nIt's not something you do everyday, so\nwe'll just jump in here and knock it out.\n\n359\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:50.120\nNow the command is incredibly long so\nthis one is gonna wrap around.\n\n360\n00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:57.570\nLet me change my screen width here a bit\nto make this all fit on the screen.\n\n361\n00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.790\nThere.\n\n362\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.540\nAlright, and I'm just doing that cuz I\nknow this command is going to wrap around.\n\n363\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.893\nAlright, so what I'm going to do is,\n\n364\n00:18:06.893 --> 00:18:11.540\nI'm going to say New-GlobalAddressList,\nand I'm gonna give it a name.\n\n365\n00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.690\nSo I might create like a SalesGAL.\n\n366\n00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:19.300\nAnd I can define a RecipientFilter.\n\n367\n00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.560\nAnd that's what you guys saw me do earlier\nin the UI, is I came in and I said,\n\n368\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.740\nI only wanna show people\nthat are in a particular OU.\n\n369\n00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.270\nOr maybe I wanna do it based\non the department field for\n\n370\n00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.620\nthe user account itself.\n\n371\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:37.439\nSo I could come in and\nI could say Department -eq \"Sales\".\n\n372\n00:18:37.439 --> 00:18:41.120\nAlright, so that's my filter for\nthis global address list.\n\n373\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.370\nAnd so that's gonna create that and\nbuild that new address list up.\n\n374\n00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.310\nAnd then I can update it to make sure\nthat it's got its information in there\n\n375\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.249\nby using update dash address list.\n\n376\n00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.240\nAs soon as it's done, there we go.\n\n377\n00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:02.080\nSo I'm gonna say, Update-AddressList and\nit's the SalesGAL that I wanna update.\n\n378\n00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.230\nAnd that's gonna make sure that\nit's up to date if I type it right.\n\n379\n00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:07.200\nLet's see.\n\n380\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.240\nUpdate.\n\n381\n00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.810\nOh, it should be\nUpdate-GlobalAddressList SalesGAL.\n\n382\n00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:14.640\nThere we go.\n\n383\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.570\nSo if I get my syntax right,\nit'll work better.\n\n384\n00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.220\nSo now I've got that address list created,\nit's updated,\n\n385\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.400\nit's got it's filter in place.\n\n386\n00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.550\nThings are good there.\n\n387\n00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:26.350\nNow I can say New-OfflineAddressBook, and\nthis is what's gonna create that OAB.\n\n388\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.710\nThe things I just did,\nI could have done through the GUI, right.\n\n389\n00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.660\nThrough the administration center but\nthis I have to do from the PowerShell.\n\n390\n00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.290\nSo I'll say new offline address book,\nand then I'll come in and\n\n391\n00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.130\nspecify a name for it.\n\n392\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.280\nI'm just gonna call mine my SalesOAB for\noffline address book.\n\n393\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.310\nAnd I need to tell it what\naddresses to contain, so\n\n394\n00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.740\nyou tell it address list\nto put inside of it.\n\n395\n00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.160\nThat's why I wanted to create\nthat address list a moment ago.\n\n396\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.841\nSo I'm going to put the SalesGAL\nin my SalesOAB, right,\n\n397\n00:19:55.841 --> 00:19:59.520\nso it's going to basically\nput that information.\n\n398\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.710\nSo, this offline address book is not going\nto contain the full global address list,\n\n399\n00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.485\njust this limited one that I need.\n\n400\n00:20:05.485 --> 00:20:10.510\nAlright, that's gonna create\nthe offline address book.\n\n401\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:15.080\nAnd I could stop right there,\ntake this offline address book, and\n\n402\n00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.610\nattach it to a mailbox database.\n\n403\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.860\nSo if I have a Sales database, I attach\nthis offline address book to it, and\n\n404\n00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.510\nthen anybody I put in that Sales database\nwill use this offline address book.\n\n405\n00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.300\nI'm done.\n\n406\n00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.150\nOkay.\n\n407\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.990\nBut I can go a step further,\nand I can create\n\n408\n00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.030\npolicies built around this that kind of\ndictate how this is going to function.\n\n409\n00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.380\nSo, for example, I might want to\nfilter this a little bit more.\n\n410\n00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.100\nTo limit what's inside of it, or to even\nadd additional addresses inside of it.\n\n411\n00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:45.710\nSo as an example, I might say,\nwe'll do New-AddressBookPolicy,\n\n412\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.390\nand I'll give this one a name of SalesABP.\n\n413\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.870\nSo this'll be an address book policy.\n\n414\n00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:56.080\nAnd I'm going to pick address\nlists to go inside of it.\n\n415\n00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.740\nAnd so, I'm going to say \\Sales,\nright, setting that path, right,\n\n416\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.230\ncuz we can nest address\nlists inside of each other.\n\n417\n00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.540\nSo I'll just say I'm going\nto include the Sales.\n\n418\n00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.410\nI'm going to specify the offline\naddress book that I want to use,\n\n419\n00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:14.840\nwhich is the one I just created, SalesOAB.\n\n420\n00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.750\nAnd then I can tell it the global address\nlist that I want these users to use.\n\n421\n00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.350\nNow, the default global\naddress list is the default.\n\n422\n00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.470\nIt's everything, the whole organization.\n\n423\n00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:28.080\nI want these people's default global\naddress list to be the sales one so\n\n424\n00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.850\nI'm going to tie that down to SalesGAL.\n\n425\n00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:37.670\nAnd then, we haven't talked about rooms,\nyet, or resource records.\n\n426\n00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.580\nWe're going to talk about\nthose in another episode.\n\n427\n00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.040\nBut when I create a policy like this,\n\n428\n00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.070\nyou have to dictate whether\nit loads rooms or not.\n\n429\n00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:49.730\nSo I'm going to -RoomList, and I'm just\ngoing to tell it to include all rooms.\n\n430\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:54.545\nThose are for using things like if we want\nto do scheduling conference rooms and\n\n431\n00:21:54.545 --> 00:21:57.190\nthings, you can define those and\nmake them a part of the address list too.\n\n432\n00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.970\nAlright, now once I've done that,\nthat was a pretty long command and\n\n433\n00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.100\nI didn't really have to do that.\n\n434\n00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.550\nI could have taken\nthe offline address book and\n\n435\n00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.350\nattached it to the mailbox database.\n\n436\n00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:11.370\nThe problem is, what if I have users\nin more than one mailbox database?\n\n437\n00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:16.290\nOr if I have Sales people and marketing\npeople in the same mailbox database, and\n\n438\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.130\nI want to do separate\nglobal address list there.\n\n439\n00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.590\nI can't do it by assigning\nit to the mailbox database.\n\n440\n00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.980\nSo by creating a policy like this,\nI can take the policy and\n\n441\n00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.850\napply it to whoever I want, right?\n\n442\n00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.190\nI can come in and say, look for people\nwhose department is set to Sales and\n\n443\n00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.840\napply this policy to them, and\nnow it's really, really granular.\n\n444\n00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.500\nAnd we do that by doing\nsomething like this.\n\n445\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:43.585\nI'll say Get-Mailbox\n-OrganizationalUnit Sales.\n\n446\n00:22:43.585 --> 00:22:47.966\nRight, give me a list of all\nthe mailboxes that are in this SalesOU.\n\n447\n00:22:47.966 --> 00:22:48.630\nAlright.\n\n448\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.270\nAnd so that you know, that's just gonna\ngive me those people, if I spell it right.\n\n449\n00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.880\nOrganizational unit.\n\n450\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.470\nThere we go.\nAnd apparently I don't have\n\n451\n00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.040\nanybody in there.\n\n452\n00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.400\nLet me take like IT.\n\n453\n00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.990\nThere we go.\nSo you can see, I'm in IT.\n\n454\n00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.880\nSo, you can pull up a list\nof everybody in that OU, or\n\n455\n00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.750\neverybody whose department is Sales,\nor whatever.\n\n456\n00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:13.310\nAnd we can pipe that into\na command to assign the policy.\n\n457\n00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:19.425\nSo if I wanted to take everybody in Sales,\nand assign that policy to them,\n\n458\n00:23:19.425 --> 00:23:24.261\nI could just say Set-Mailbox\n-AddressBookPolicy, and\n\n459\n00:23:24.261 --> 00:23:27.450\nthen assign SalesABP to them.\n\n460\n00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.150\nAnd by doing,\n\n461\n00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:32.750\nthat it doesn't matter if I have a mixture\nof employees in the same database.\n\n462\n00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.120\nIt doesn't matter what\ndatabase they're in.\n\n463\n00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.270\nI'm just saying take everybody that's in\nthat OU, and assign this policy to them,\n\n464\n00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.580\nso that they'll get the offline\naddress book that we created.\n\n465\n00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.550\nAnd now when they go into Outlook and\nOutlook is offline, or\n\n466\n00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.310\nOutlook is downloaded and running cache\nmode, they'll see the address list.\n\n467\n00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.440\nAnd it'll be filtered down\nto just the Sales people,\n\n468\n00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.700\nor just the people in Florida,\njust the people in London.\n\n469\n00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.890\nWhatever it is that we wanna create,\nright?\n\n470\n00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.200\nNow, that was kind of a pain, running\nthrough those commands to do it, but\n\n471\n00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.440\nit's not something you have\nto do very often, right?\n\n472\n00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.790\nYou create it, you put it in place.\n\n473\n00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.590\nNow this policy that I applied,\n\n474\n00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.730\nwhat happens if I create\na new employee in that OU?\n\n475\n00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.730\nThis policy wasn't applied to them, right?\n\n476\n00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.520\nIt was applied to the people that\nwere in there at the time I ran it.\n\n477\n00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.580\nSo if we want this to be\na long standing thing,\n\n478\n00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.700\nwe probably need to schedule\nthis to run every night.\n\n479\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.800\nJust every night, or whenever, reach out\nand look if there's new employees and\n\n480\n00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.510\nassign this address book policy to them.\n\n481\n00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.250\nOtherwise they're not gonna have it.\n\n482\n00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.920\nOr when I create new users, if I clone an\nexisting user, right, instead of creating\n\n483\n00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.950\na new user from scratch, if I clone one,\nthen it'll carry over their properties,\n\n484\n00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.750\nwhich includes which offline\naddress book they're gonna use.\n\n485\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.900\nSo that'll help to ensure\nthat doesn't happen too.\n\n486\n00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.595\nSo those are just little things\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n487\n00:24:39.595 --> 00:24:46.210\nAlright, so at first glance, address books\nseem pretty simple inside of Exchange,\n\n488\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.810\nbut there's a lot more that we\ncan do with them, isn't there?\n\n489\n00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.560\nAs far as customizing this,\nchanging that behavior, and\n\n490\n00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.280\nreally getting the address list to\nreflect what we want within our company.\n\n491\n00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.680\nIt can really make things handy.\n\n492\n00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.810\nMake it a lot easier to find employees,\n\n493\n00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.409\nespecially when you have\npeople with duplicate names.\n\n494\n00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.070\nAll right, well that's a pretty good\nspot for us to wrap this one up.\n\n495\n00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.520\nAll those PowerShell commands,\nI'll put those in the show notes so\n\n496\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.450\nyou guys have them and\nyou can use them for reference.\n\n497\n00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.670\nThey'll definitely be available.\n\n498\n00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.910\nBut otherwise, for this episode,\nI think that wraps it up.\n\n499\n00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.920\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n500\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.690\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n501\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.884\nAnd I'll see you next time.\n\n502\n00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:24.390\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.816\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.260\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.639\nback again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:24.899\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna take a\nlook at something that's kind of overdue,\n\n7\n00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.410\nrecipients, right?\n\n8\n00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.136\nRecipients in Exchange, most of\nthe people or things that we e-mail,\n\n9\n00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:33.612\nwhen you send an e-mail to somebody,\nthe person in your to field,\n\n10\n00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:37.611\nright, the person you are sending\nyour e-mail to, they're a recipient.\n\n11\n00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.160\nThey're gonna receive\ninformation from you.\n\n12\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.121\nSo in Exchange, if we expect it to work,\n\n13\n00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:45.110\nwe're gonna need to set up\nat least one recipient.\n\n14\n00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.380\nAt least one person who can receive\ninformation and deal with it, right?\n\n15\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.280\nSo that's a pretty important thing.\n\n16\n00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.429\nAnd the most common type of\nrecipient is a user mailbox.\n\n17\n00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.807\nWe have user accounts\ninside of Active Directory,\n\n18\n00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:01.030\nwe want them to have a mailbox so\nthat they can send and receive email.\n\n19\n00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.600\nThat's our most common type of recipient.\n\n20\n00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.211\nBut under the hood in Exchange,\n\n21\n00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:08.321\nthere's actually like 12\ndifferent types of recipients.\n\n22\n00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:10.050\nThere's a ton of different ones.\n\n23\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.600\nSo in this episode, I wanna tackle\nsome of the more important ones.\n\n24\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.310\nI'm gonna save a few for another episode\nthough, and those are groups and\n\n25\n00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.050\ndistribution lists.\n\n26\n00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.660\nDistribution lists are really\njust a collection of recipients.\n\n27\n00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.340\nSo I wanna make sure we tackle\nthe individual recipients first and\n\n28\n00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.859\nthen we'll talk about\ncollecting them together.\n\n29\n00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.460\nWell, let's start with\nthe most basic of recipient,\n\n30\n00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.120\nthe most important one, the mailbox.\n\n31\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.932\nInside of Microsoft Exchange 2013,\nusers do not get mail boxes by default,\n\n32\n00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:38.634\nall right?\n\n33\n00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:41.436\nWhen you go and\ncreate a user in the Active Directory,\n\n34\n00:01:41.436 --> 00:01:43.560\nthey don't necessarily get a mailbox.\n\n35\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.220\nAnd so that's something that we're\ngoing to have to kinda sort out\n\n36\n00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.020\nto make sure that we get everything right\nand in place when we create somebody.\n\n37\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.100\nSo if I take a look at my Active\nDirectory, I've got an ITProTV OU created.\n\n38\n00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.440\nI've got a Sales OU created, and inside of\nsales, I've got Jane Smith and John Doe.\n\n39\n00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.380\nThese are a couple of\nusers that I whipped up.\n\n40\n00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.320\nOr if I wanna whip up another user here,\nI can just come in and do New User and\n\n41\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.050\nwe'll create,\nwe'll do Bob Denver, all right?\n\n42\n00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.820\nBob Denver, he needs email.\n\n43\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.400\nSo here we go.\n\n44\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.300\nWe'll just get his account whipped up and\nwe'll give him a super\n\n45\n00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.610\nsecure password, which we'll set\nnot to expire cuz that's awesome.\n\n46\n00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.910\nAll right.\nSo I just whipped up a user.\n\n47\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.960\nNow as I created this user,\ndid it ever ask me about an email address?\n\n48\n00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.750\nIt didn't.\n\n49\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.253\nIt's got the login name, which kind of\nlooks like an email address, right?\n\n50\n00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:40.460\nA user at a fully qualified domain name.\n\n51\n00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.400\nBut it's not actually creating\na mailbox for that user.\n\n52\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.030\nNow, how do I know it's\nnot creating a mailbox?\n\n53\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.580\nWell, I can go and look.\n\n54\n00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.850\nIf I jump back over to my\nExchange Administration Center,\n\n55\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.570\nwe can jump in here, well,\nI can try and jump in here.\n\n56\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.580\nThere we go.\n\n57\n00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.610\nAnd in the Exchange Administration Center,\nit actually defaults to the recipient\n\n58\n00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.220\nview, and right here,\nI can see all of my mailboxes.\n\n59\n00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.040\nAnd I see Don Pezet.\n\n60\n00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.270\nI've got a mailbox, but\nI don't see John Doe.\n\n61\n00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.662\nI don't see Jane Smith, and I definitely\ndon't see Bob Denver, who I just created.\n\n62\n00:03:09.662 --> 00:03:13.480\nI'm gonna hit refresh to just to make\nsure I've got the latest information.\n\n63\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.520\nIt's not created.\n\n64\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.310\nAll right.\n\n65\n00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.410\nUser accounts in Active Directory\ncan become recipients, but\n\n66\n00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.830\nthey aren't recipients by default.\n\n67\n00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.866\nSo if I wanna make them have a mailbox,\n\n68\n00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:28.016\nwhat I need to do is I need to make them\nwhat are called mail-enabled objects.\n\n69\n00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:29.909\nMail-enabled just means\nthat they have a mailbox,\n\n70\n00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.100\nthat you can actually send email to them.\n\n71\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.630\nSo when I come into recipients and\nmailboxes, and\n\n72\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.270\nI hit this plus sign, you'll see that\nI can create a user mailbox, and\n\n73\n00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.320\nthat's what's gonna mail enable that\nobject inside of the Active Directory.\n\n74\n00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.860\nNow there's two types of mailboxes they\nreference here, a user mailbox and\n\n75\n00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.350\na linked mailbox.\n\n76\n00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.550\nWhat's that all about?\n\n77\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.200\nWell, a user mailbox is where you've got\na user account in your Active Directory.\n\n78\n00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.570\nAnd you're gonna create a mailbox for\nthem.\n\n79\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.120\nA linked mailbox is where you've\ngot a user account in somebody\n\n80\n00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.110\nelse's Active Directory and you're\ngonna create a mailbox for them, right?\n\n81\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.369\nSo you might have\nan Active Directory federation and\n\n82\n00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:11.512\nyou've got a completely separate\nforest that you're federated with.\n\n83\n00:04:11.512 --> 00:04:14.361\nYou might have other domains\ninside of your environment, and\n\n84\n00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:17.920\nthe users over there in that domain\nare over in some other forest.\n\n85\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.788\nAnd you want the mailbox to be right here.\n\n86\n00:04:19.788 --> 00:04:23.320\nYou see that a lot with organizations\nwhere you've got a parent company and\n\n87\n00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.310\nchild companies underneath it.\n\n88\n00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.249\nThe parent company might wanna\nhost all the mailboxes, but\n\n89\n00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.497\nthe child companies\nhave their own domains.\n\n90\n00:04:30.497 --> 00:04:32.580\nSo here we would do a linked mailbox.\n\n91\n00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.070\nWell, in my case,\nI'm just gonna do a user mailbox.\n\n92\n00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.060\nAnd when I choose to do a user mailbox,\n\n93\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.960\nI've got the opportunity to\ncreate an all new user account.\n\n94\n00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.420\nThat means it'll create\nan Active Directory user and\n\n95\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.840\na mailbox at the same time, or\nI can build one around an existing user.\n\n96\n00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.170\nSo I can come in and I can say,\n\n97\n00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.510\nI'm gonna say Bob Denver,\nI'm just gonna give him an alias.\n\n98\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.820\nYou have to give them an alias,\n\n99\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.710\nthis is like a shortcut name that people\ncould type to quickly email the person.\n\n100\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.700\nAnd then I can browse and\nI can pick an existing user.\n\n101\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.640\nAnd so I can come in and\nI can find Bob Denver.\n\n102\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.330\nNow, notice how I'm not in this list,\nDon Pezet.\n\n103\n00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.450\nI don't show up.\n\n104\n00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.270\nThat's because I already have a mailbox,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.080\nSo I'm not gonna show up.\n\n106\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.110\nThis is filtered to users\nthat don't have mailboxes.\n\n107\n00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.720\nAnd so I'll take ol' Bob Denver and\npick him.\n\n108\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.430\nAnd I don't need to provide any of\nthis other information cuz it's\n\n109\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.230\nalready defined on the user\naccount in the Active Directory.\n\n110\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.150\nI can go and hit Save and it's gonna\nwhip up that mailbox for Bob Denver.\n\n111\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.120\nNow, when it makes his mailbox, it's gonna\nput it in my default mailbox database.\n\n112\n00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.090\nIf I have more than one\nmailbox database though,\n\n113\n00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.440\nI might want him to reside somewhere else.\n\n114\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.650\nSo when you bring that user in, you can\nchoose to create that user mailbox.\n\n115\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.542\nYou can browse and pick the user,\nI'll take Jane Smith this time.\n\n116\n00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:47.270\nAnd I'll pick her and\nI'll give her an alias.\n\n117\n00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.510\nAnd then down here at the bottom,\nyou've got more options.\n\n118\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.670\nAnd under more options, you can pick what\nmailbox database they're gonna go into.\n\n119\n00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.700\nThat's what'll let you\nmove that somewhere else.\n\n120\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.370\nOr you can assign a address book\npolicy if you've got one created.\n\n121\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.530\nIn a previous episode, I showed you guys\nhow to make address book policies, and\n\n122\n00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.580\nso I can go in and choose that sales\none for Jane, and I can browse and\n\n123\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.720\npick to put her in the sales\nmailbox database, right?\n\n124\n00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.230\nHer active directory user\naccount is already created.\n\n125\n00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.780\nThis is just a mailbox that I'm\ndictating where it's gonna reside and\n\n126\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.480\nwhat policies she's gonna have.\n\n127\n00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.270\nAnd so now I've got her account,\nshe's created, and she's in there.\n\n128\n00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.900\nBut I could create new users\nfrom scratch if I wanted.\n\n129\n00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.790\nIf I go to new user mailbox and\nI create, let's do Christopher Walken.\n\n130\n00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.410\nSo I'm gonna create a new user\ncalled Christopher Walken.\n\n131\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.050\nAnd we're gonna give him a mailbox, right?\n\n132\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.990\nSo there's just some basic\ninformation we need to provide.\n\n133\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.750\nUser name.\n\n134\n00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.760\nFull name.\n\n135\n00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.460\nUser login name here.\n\n136\n00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.810\nSo we'll make him Christopher Walken.\n\n137\n00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.500\nI probably need to come up with\na better naming convention,\n\n138\n00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.710\ncuz that's a long user name,\nbut it'll work.\n\n139\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.774\nAnd we'll get that punched in.\n\n140\n00:06:58.452 --> 00:06:59.550\nAll right.\n\n141\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.010\nAnd then I can go in and set more options,\nif I want, on this user.\n\n142\n00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.100\nSo it's all set the way that I want\nit to be from the very beginning.\n\n143\n00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.580\nRight?\nThat's kinda the neat part.\n\n144\n00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.160\nBy creating it here, I get the user and\nthe mailbox created at the same time.\n\n145\n00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.200\nNow while this sounds like a great idea,\nin practice,\n\n146\n00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.870\nyou're not gonna use this very much.\n\n147\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.870\nAnd the reason is,\n\n148\n00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.760\nwhen we create Active Directory users,\nwe normally clone an existing user, right,\n\n149\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.404\nwe duplicate somebody so that we get the\nsame group memberships and permissions.\n\n150\n00:07:23.404 --> 00:07:27.280\nIf Christopher Walken's my new sales\nperson, I wanna go copy a sales person so\n\n151\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.830\nthey have the same memberships.\n\n152\n00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.550\nBy doing it this way,\nit's not copying anybody.\n\n153\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.960\nSo yeah, I get a mailbox at the same time,\nwhich is nice, but now I've gotta go and\n\n154\n00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.150\nset all those permissions, and\nthat's harder than creating a mailbox.\n\n155\n00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.630\nSo normally we don't do it this way.\n\n156\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.100\nWe duplicate the user in the AD, and\n\n157\n00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.000\nthen we just come in here\nin mail enable that user.\n\n158\n00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.980\nThat makes life a lot easier.\n\n159\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.593\nAnd you can do this from\nthe PowerShell too.\n\n160\n00:07:47.593 --> 00:07:50.411\nThe nice part about the PowerShell\nis I can mail enable tons of users.\n\n161\n00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:54.672\nI could say, find every user in the entire\nActive Directory, just do like a get-user,\n\n162\n00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:56.413\nthen that's gonna get everybody.\n\n163\n00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:58.155\nOr get dash AD user.\n\n164\n00:07:58.155 --> 00:08:02.149\nThat'll get everybody, and then pipe that\ninto the new dash mail box commune and\n\n165\n00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:04.900\nit'll whip them up and\nyou'll have it in no time.\n\n166\n00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.170\nSo that'll knock things out really fast.\n\n167\n00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.520\nBut now, I've got recipients.\n\n168\n00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.310\nI've got these users\nthat are being created.\n\n169\n00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.940\nNow I can start to email these people.\n\n170\n00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.180\nNow they can receive email.\n\n171\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.430\nBut there's a little more that I\nneed to worry about here, right?\n\n172\n00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.530\nWhen I define these recipients,\nwhat's their email address?\n\n173\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.170\nWell, I see it right over here.\n\n174\n00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.210\nSome of them might not\nlike that email address.\n\n175\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.000\nLike here, Christopher Walken.\n\n176\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.560\nOh, you know what?\n\n177\n00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.110\nI spelled his name wrong, didn't I?\n\n178\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.860\nIf you look at the name,\nit's Christopher Waken.\n\n179\n00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.210\nI didn't spell his name right.\n\n180\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.490\nSo now I need to go in and fix that.\n\n181\n00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.080\nWell there's a lot of options\nthat they didn't show us\n\n182\n00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.180\nwhen we initially create the user.\n\n183\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.870\nSo if you take one of these mailboxes and\n\n184\n00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.740\nyou edit it, you'll see a lot more\noptions that weren't there a moment ago.\n\n185\n00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.629\nAnd so I'll see things like my general\nscreen here where I can find my typo,\n\n186\n00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:52.496\nwhich was in the alias right there.\n\n187\n00:08:52.496 --> 00:08:55.069\nNotice how it built the email\naddress off of the alias and\n\n188\n00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:58.652\nnot off of the user account, and that's\nwhy that alias is kind of important.\n\n189\n00:08:58.652 --> 00:09:00.630\nAll right, so I can fix that.\n\n190\n00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.290\nBut that's not actually\ngonna fix my other problem.\n\n191\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.690\nMy problem is the email address.\n\n192\n00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.280\nAnd as I look down the left side,\nyou'll see all sorts of stuff here,\n\n193\n00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.440\nincluding email address.\n\n194\n00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.050\nAnd I can come in here, and\nI can edit that address, or\n\n195\n00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.027\nI can even add more, right?\n\n196\n00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.190\nMaybe Christopher's been using that\nemail address for weeks now and\n\n197\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.470\njust didn't say anything.\n\n198\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.880\nAnd then he comes to me and is like,\nit's wrong, can you change it?\n\n199\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.530\nBut I'm receiving email at that old\naddress so can I keep the old address?\n\n200\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.400\nOr maybe you have somebody who got married\nand they wanna change their last name.\n\n201\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.920\nWell you want them to have the old\naddress so they still get that email, but\n\n202\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.540\nyou want them to have a new address, too.\n\n203\n00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.579\nSo we might want to add more addresses\nto them and you can certainly do that.\n\n204\n00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.700\nIn the background, there's this\nrecipient update service that runs,\n\n205\n00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.550\nthe RUS, and it looks at any new recipient\nand it applies a default template\n\n206\n00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.660\nof email addresses to the user,\nso that's happening.\n\n207\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.220\nYou can add more addresses in\naddition to the default and\n\n208\n00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.300\nthat's no big deal, or,\nif you look here at the bottom, it's got\n\n209\n00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.820\nautomatically update email addresses\nbased on the email address policy.\n\n210\n00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.840\nWe can turn that off and\nthen you can remove addresses and\n\n211\n00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.282\nchange what's the default and so on.\n\n212\n00:10:07.282 --> 00:10:12.290\nI'm gonna add the correct address here,\nand so I'm gonna add an SMTP address.\n\n213\n00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.230\nYou'll see there's other\ntypes of addresses supported,\n\n214\n00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.928\nbut SMTP's kind of the world\nstandard right now.\n\n215\n00:10:17.928 --> 00:10:23.280\nAnd I'm gonna punch in\nthe properly spelled address,\n\n216\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.910\nand I'll go ahead and attach that.\n\n217\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:29.230\nNow, notice how the address\nthat I added says smtp and\n\n218\n00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.290\nit's lowercase, and the other one\nsays SMTP and it's uppercase.\n\n219\n00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.470\nWhat's that all about?\n\n220\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.460\nWell, the one that's uppercase,\nthat's the default.\n\n221\n00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.085\nAnd so this guy right here has been\nflagged as the default address for him.\n\n222\n00:10:41.085 --> 00:10:44.272\nSo if he hits reply to an email,\nit's gonna reply with that default and\n\n223\n00:10:44.272 --> 00:10:45.798\nthat's gonna be spelled wrong.\n\n224\n00:10:45.798 --> 00:10:47.380\nSo, I may not want that.\n\n225\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.390\nI might wanna change that and\nthat's something that we can do.\n\n226\n00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.750\nWhen you edit the address,\n\n227\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.370\nsee how I don't really have an option\nto change the default here?\n\n228\n00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.680\nThe default's already set.\n\n229\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.790\nIt's because of this automatic update,\nit's pulling from that policy.\n\n230\n00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.890\nAnd if I turn that off and\nsave and then come back in and\n\n231\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:10.640\nedit his user account again, now I’ll\nbe able to come in and manipulate that.\n\n232\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.174\nAnd so when we take a look at these\naddresses, we can edit them and\n\n233\n00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:18.755\nnow I’ve got make this reply address that\ndidn’t show up before because the policy\n\n234\n00:11:18.755 --> 00:11:20.380\nwas defining that.\n\n235\n00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.030\nAnd so I’ll make this one the default,\nthe one that’s spelled right.\n\n236\n00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.411\nHe’s still got the old one\nthat’s spelled wrong, but\n\n237\n00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:27.033\nnow he’s got the correct one, too.\n\n238\n00:11:27.033 --> 00:11:28.880\nAll right, so you can have more addresses.\n\n239\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.740\nI usually add a bunch.\n\n240\n00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.960\nFor me I’ll do D Pizzette,\nDon Pizzette, Don dot Pizzette,\n\n241\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.310\nyou know all the different combinations\nof names I think people might type,\n\n242\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.220\nI'll add them all in there, and\nthat way I'll get all those emails.\n\n243\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.080\nBut then that default is\njust Don at whatever.\n\n244\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.800\nSo you can pick that one that you want.\n\n245\n00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.590\nYou can really customize that stuff.\n\n246\n00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.590\nThere's other things that\nwe can tweak in here.\n\n247\n00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.540\nThings like our general information,\nname and so on.\n\n248\n00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.480\nThis is all being stored\nin the Active Directory, so\n\n249\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.940\nthis updates your Active Directory\nrecord at the same time.\n\n250\n00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.240\nYou can go into mailbox usage and you'll\nget an example of the last time they\n\n251\n00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.790\nlogged in, this user has never logged in,\nand how much data they're using,\n\n252\n00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.800\nhow big their mailbox is.\n\n253\n00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.480\nThat's pretty useful.\n\n254\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.010\nYou can view contact information.\n\n255\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.370\nThis, again, it's straight out\nof the Active Directory, so\n\n256\n00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.970\nif it's already populated there,\nit's gonna be populated here.\n\n257\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.580\nOr if we type it here, it'll turn around\nand populate it in the Active Directory.\n\n258\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:23.640\nSo if I give Christopher a city and\na state, right, we can come in and punch\n\n259\n00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.750\nin some of this data, well now it's gonna\nbe writing that to the Active Directory.\n\n260\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.050\nWhen you set organizational values,\ndepartments, right?\n\n261\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.060\nIf we're doing things like filtering\nbased on department we wanna make sure\n\n262\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.100\nthose are set.\n\n263\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.410\nSo we can punch those in.\n\n264\n00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.990\nYou've also got some other features,\nlike whether we're sharing the mailbox,\n\n265\n00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.070\nor sharing other resources.\n\n266\n00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.580\nI'll talk about those more in a minute.\n\n267\n00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.910\nThose are some of the main things.\n\n268\n00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.510\nI do wanna talk about mailbox delegation.\n\n269\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.410\nI'll probably save that for\nanother episode though,\n\n270\n00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.270\nwhere we can share mailboxes that way.\n\n271\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.220\nBut basically, once this is done,\nI've got that user account there created.\n\n272\n00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.650\nSo, there's Christopher Walken.\n\n273\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.559\nHe's got a properly spelled email\naddress now and he's ready to rock.\n\n274\n00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:04.949\nAnd if I jump over to\nthe Active Directory user for him, so\n\n275\n00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:07.243\nif I come in here and find him.\n\n276\n00:13:07.243 --> 00:13:10.170\nWell, actually finding him's gonna\nbe a little bit of a challenge.\n\n277\n00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.170\nHe's not here in the sales OU,\n\n278\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.750\nand that's because when I created the\naccount I created it through Exchange and\n\n279\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:21.680\nit didn't ask me for an OU, so he'll just\nend up in the regular old users container,\n\n280\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.740\nand there he is right there,\nand I can just move him.\n\n281\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.685\nI'll move him into sales.\n\n282\n00:13:25.685 --> 00:13:29.087\nSo we'll throw him over there, and\nnow I've got him right here in sales.\n\n283\n00:13:29.087 --> 00:13:31.640\nAnd if I edit his account and\nI go to address,\n\n284\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.400\nsee how it's got city, state, ZIP code?\n\n285\n00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.560\nIt's all tied together, right?\n\n286\n00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.149\nExchange is storing all this\ninformation in the Active Directory.\n\n287\n00:13:40.608 --> 00:13:43.136\nAll right, now that I've got that user,\nhe can go and log in.\n\n288\n00:13:43.136 --> 00:13:44.884\nHe can log in to Outlook Web Access or\n\n289\n00:13:44.884 --> 00:13:48.751\nfire up the Microsoft Outlook Client\nConnect and access his mailbox, right.\n\n290\n00:13:48.751 --> 00:13:52.945\nNow there are a few other types of email\nrecipients that we might have that\n\n291\n00:13:52.945 --> 00:13:55.160\nare kinda based around users.\n\n292\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.030\nIn this example, the user account is\nright here in my own Active Directory.\n\n293\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.800\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n294\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.610\nWhat if you have a contractor, right?\n\n295\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.060\nSomebody that you work with a lot.\n\n296\n00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.690\nThey've already got their own\nemail account set up in their own\n\n297\n00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.710\nenvironment somewhere else.\n\n298\n00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.520\nWe don't wanna create a mailbox for\nthem here.\n\n299\n00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.060\nThey've already got their own.\n\n300\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.600\nBut, I want my employees to see that\ncontractor in the address list.\n\n301\n00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.746\nI want them to show up.\n\n302\n00:14:17.746 --> 00:14:22.874\nWell for that, we can create what's called\na contact, and a contact is not a mailbox,\n\n303\n00:14:22.874 --> 00:14:26.260\nnot a user, but\na reference to an external user, right?\n\n304\n00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.960\nAn external user with an external mailbox,\nthat's a contact.\n\n305\n00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.160\nAnd so, if we jump back over\nto the Exchange admin center,\n\n306\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.930\nI was under mail boxes.\n\n307\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.540\nYou'll see over here where I\ncan jump over to contacts.\n\n308\n00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.850\nAnd under contacts, I can start\nto create these external users.\n\n309\n00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:46.220\nSo maybe I wanna add somebody, so\nI'll go over here to mail contact,\n\n310\n00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.330\nand I'll punch in somebody who's external,\nright?\n\n311\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.170\nMaybe I'll want to be able to email\nBill Gates at a moment's notice, so\n\n312\n00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.250\nI'm gonna add in Bill Gates.\n\n313\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.540\nIt's got his name.\n\n314\n00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:02.610\nI can punch in an alias for him, and then\nI can punch in his external email address,\n\n315\n00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.450\nwhich I think is bill@microsoft.com or\nsomething like that.\n\n316\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.320\nSo I'm just gonna punch that in, right?\n\n317\n00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.220\nAnd I can pick an OU right here or\nwhere I wanna put this contact, but\n\n318\n00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.780\nI'll just leave it at the default.\n\n319\n00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.450\nWhen this gets created, I'll now\nhave a contact in my address list.\n\n320\n00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.620\nWhen somebody pulls up the global address\nlist they'll see my Active Directory users\n\n321\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.380\nand they'll see Bill Gates.\n\n322\n00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.800\nAnd if they send an email to Bill Gates,\nit just sends it to bill@microsoft.com.\n\n323\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.420\nIt's an external user.\n\n324\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.840\nThat's a recipient too, right?\n\n325\n00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.160\nIt's a recipient that we can email to,\nit's just the mailbox isn't right here.\n\n326\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.450\nNow when I created this contact,\nthere was another option.\n\n327\n00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.210\nWhat I just did was a mail contact.\n\n328\n00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.740\nThat's an external account,\nexternal mailbox, everything's outside.\n\n329\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.070\nThis is just a reference to\nsomebody outside our organization.\n\n330\n00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.895\nA mail user's a little bit different,\nall right?\n\n331\n00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:48.995\nLet's go back to that contractor example.\n\n332\n00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:51.954\nWhat if I want that contractor to\ncome into my building and do work?\n\n333\n00:15:51.954 --> 00:15:54.193\nI want them to sit down and\nlog in on a computer.\n\n334\n00:15:54.193 --> 00:15:55.830\nWell, they've got their own mailbox.\n\n335\n00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.768\nThey've got their own user account\nback at their own company.\n\n336\n00:15:58.768 --> 00:16:00.927\nBut is that gonna let them\nlog in on a computer?\n\n337\n00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:06.700\nNo, so\na mail user is a special kind of contact.\n\n338\n00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.940\nIt's actually\nan Active Directory user account.\n\n339\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.340\nIt's a user account that you can use to\nlog into computers, but instead of having\n\n340\n00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:17.460\na mailbox here, you have an external\nmailbox, a mailbox stored somewhere else.\n\n341\n00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.570\nSo I might come in and create a mail user.\n\n342\n00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.320\nAnd come in and define this one, so\nwe'll do, let's see, we did Bill Gates,\n\n343\n00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.770\nlet's do Steve Jobs this time.\n\n344\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.310\nSo I might want to say Steve Jobs,\ncuz he would love to log in and\n\n345\n00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:35.260\nadminister my Windows system, and\nI'll punch in that he's steve@apple.com.\n\n346\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.860\nThat's his external email address.\n\n347\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:42.340\nBut then I can attach this to\nan existing Active Directory user or\n\n348\n00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.280\nmake an all new Active Directory user.\n\n349\n00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.360\nSo this one is going to\nhave a user account.\n\n350\n00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.130\nHe'll be able to log in to computers.\n\n351\n00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.760\nHe'll be able to use my system,\nbut his email will be external.\n\n352\n00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.430\nAnd that's a big deal cuz you don't\nwant your contractors to have to have\n\n353\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.690\nmultiple mailboxes just because\nthey're doing work with you, right?\n\n354\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.240\nWe wanna try and\nkeep all this as simple as possible.\n\n355\n00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.970\nSo I'll get that created, and\n\n356\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:11.440\nnow they show up as a contact, even\nthough they have an actual user account.\n\n357\n00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.679\nIf I jump back to mailboxes,\nSteve Jobs doesn't show up there.\n\n358\n00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:18.990\nHe has an actual user account,\nbut I'm not hosting his mailbox.\n\n359\n00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.420\nThat's what's called a mail user.\n\n360\n00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.070\nThe two different types of contacts there,\nMail contact and Mail user.\n\n361\n00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:26.230\nMail contact is fully external.\n\n362\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.070\nMail user is external email but\na local account.\n\n363\n00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.750\nAnother type of recipient\nthat we can have.\n\n364\n00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.320\nThere's a few different\nones that we can do here.\n\n365\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.200\nActually, I think I'm gonna\nhold off on resources.\n\n366\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.469\nLet's talk about shared mailboxes.\n\n367\n00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.820\nEach example that I've given you guys so\nfar has been tied around one person.\n\n368\n00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.460\nI've got a contact for Bill Gates,\nor a contact for Steve Jobs.\n\n369\n00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.060\nI've got a mailbox for Christopher Walken.\n\n370\n00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.950\nThese are individual people.\n\n371\n00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.240\nWhat if I have somebody generic though?\n\n372\n00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.110\nWhat if I wanna set up a generic\nmailbox for information?\n\n373\n00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.630\nA lot of websites, you go to the website\nand at the bottom it says If you have any\n\n374\n00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:10.040\nquestions, email info@microsoft.com or\ninfor@apple.com or whatever.\n\n375\n00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.000\nThat's a generic mailbox.\n\n376\n00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.180\nWho does that go to?\n\n377\n00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.910\nWell, it probably goes\nto a generic mailbox\n\n378\n00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.390\nthat multiple people can log into and\ncheck.\n\n379\n00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.000\nSo it's a special kind of recipient, and\n\n380\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.650\nin Exchange that's\ncalled a shared mailbox.\n\n381\n00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.770\nIt's a special recipient because it's\nnot really tied to a single user,\n\n382\n00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.320\nit's multiple users.\n\n383\n00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.750\nAnd normally a recipient\nis a one-to-one thing.\n\n384\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.010\nThe mailbox is tied to one user.\n\n385\n00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.100\nA shared mailbox breaks that rule.\n\n386\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.900\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n387\n00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.380\nHere inside of my admin center,\nif I jump over here to shared,\n\n388\n00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.200\nthen we can come in and we can start\nto create these shared mailboxes.\n\n389\n00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.127\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna create a mailbox, and\n\n390\n00:18:46.127 --> 00:18:48.830\nit's gonna create\nan Active Directory user.\n\n391\n00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.650\nIt's just gonna disable the user.\n\n392\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.830\nSo the user will be disabled by default.\n\n393\n00:18:52.830 --> 00:19:00.105\nSo I might come in here and create a new\none which I'll call something like info.\n\n394\n00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:05.270\nSo this is gonna be my information\nmailbox, and the alias will just be info.\n\n395\n00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.700\nAnd for the organizational unit,\nmaybe I'll stick that in my Sales OU.\n\n396\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:16.320\nSo I'm creating this info@lab.itpro.tv,\nthis generic mailbox.\n\n397\n00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.503\nOkay, in the chat room they give\nyou the example of a help desk.\n\n398\n00:19:18.503 --> 00:19:22.895\nYou might have helpdesk@lab.itpro.tv and\nyou'd want all the help desk technicians\n\n399\n00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:25.360\nto be able to log into\nthis single mailbox.\n\n400\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.430\nNow I could set up a distribution list for\nthis, right?\n\n401\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.750\nAn email comes in and\nit gets distributed to multiple people.\n\n402\n00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.610\nBut here's the problem with\nthe distribution list,\n\n403\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.231\nespecially with the help desk example.\n\n404\n00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.020\nHow do I know if somebody else has\ndealt with that ticket or not?\n\n405\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:39.740\nI don't.\n\n406\n00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.514\nIf that distribution list forwards\nthe ticket to five different techs,\n\n407\n00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:45.670\nthe five techs don't know if one\nof the others have dealt with it.\n\n408\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.370\nWith a shared mailbox, you do.\n\n409\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.270\nIf you log into the shared mailbox and\nit's already marked as read or\n\n410\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.150\nit's already been deleted, then it's gone.\n\n411\n00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:56.100\nSo a shared mailbox makes sure that\neverybody is on the same page.\n\n412\n00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.610\nAll right, then down at the bottom\nwe've got Send As permissions.\n\n413\n00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.720\nNormally when you create a shared mailbox,\nyou want people to be able to read\n\n414\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.840\nthe email in it but not necessarily\nsend email as that mailbox.\n\n415\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.560\nBut if I want them to be able to send\nemail as info@lab.itpro.tv or helpdesk or\n\n416\n00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.800\nwhatever, I would add\nthose people to this list.\n\n417\n00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.880\nBut otherwise it's got the information\nthat I need created here.\n\n418\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.610\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust say OK to that.\n\n419\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.950\nAnd it's gonna create it,\nit's gonna build it up.\n\n420\n00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.870\nAnd what it's doing is it's\ncreating an Active Directory user,\n\n421\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.240\nit's mail enabling the user and\nthen it is disabling the account.\n\n422\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.430\nSo it did all that in the background.\n\n423\n00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.770\nOr in theory it did it,\nI guess we can go and verify.\n\n424\n00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:40.350\nIf I jump over to my domain controller and\nI'll just refresh this screen,\n\n425\n00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.560\nthere's the info account and\nit's probably hard to see.\n\n426\n00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.350\nThere's a little, tiny black arrow on\nthat user, or if I go into their account\n\n427\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.980\ninformation, I should be able to see\nin here that the account is disabled.\n\n428\n00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.500\nYeah, right there.\n\n429\n00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.330\nSo the account's been disabled,\nbut it has been created and\n\n430\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.590\nit's got that email address\nof info@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n431\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:04.140\nSo now what I need to do is I need to give\npeople permission to open that mailbox.\n\n432\n00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.065\nAnd the way you do it is\nyou edit the mailbox.\n\n433\n00:21:07.315 --> 00:21:10.765\nAnd then in here you'll have all these\ndifferent options on the left side.\n\n434\n00:21:10.765 --> 00:21:14.005\nAnd what we wanna do is we wanna give\npeople full access to the mailbox so\n\n435\n00:21:14.005 --> 00:21:16.795\nthey'll be able to open this up and\nget into it.\n\n436\n00:21:16.795 --> 00:21:19.787\nSo on the left side here\nyou'll see mailbox delegation,\n\n437\n00:21:19.787 --> 00:21:22.617\nand then you've got Full Access.\n\n438\n00:21:22.617 --> 00:21:27.127\nI want to give users full access to this\nmailbox, so they'll be able to open it up.\n\n439\n00:21:27.127 --> 00:21:30.135\nAnd I would just come through and pick,\nand I can do this based on a group.\n\n440\n00:21:30.135 --> 00:21:33.777\nSo I could say Sales, anybody in\nthe Sales department can open this up.\n\n441\n00:21:33.777 --> 00:21:36.497\nOr I can do individual people,\nlike I'll just do myself here.\n\n442\n00:21:36.497 --> 00:21:41.230\nI'm going to add in Don Pezet, so I'm\nallowed to open up this shared mailbox.\n\n443\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.540\nAll right, and\nwe'll go ahead and save that.\n\n444\n00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.740\nSo now I've got permission\nto open up the mailbox.\n\n445\n00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.090\nHow do I get into it?\n\n446\n00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:53.180\nWell, back in Outlook, or you can do it\nin OWA too, it works either way, but here\n\n447\n00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.960\nin Outlook, when you fire up Outlook by\ndefault it's opening up just your mailbox.\n\n448\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.810\nYou open up one mailbox.\n\n449\n00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.990\nBut you can open up other mailboxes.\n\n450\n00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:06.000\nIf you go up here to File and\nthen Open & Export,\n\n451\n00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.610\nin here you'll see you've got\nthe option to open Other User's Folder.\n\n452\n00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:13.990\nAnd we can choose that, and I'm gonna just\npunch in Info, or you could browse and\n\n453\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.450\nfind it from the name list,\nit'll be in there somewhere.\n\n454\n00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.500\nMy address list is not updated yet.\n\n455\n00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.400\nSo I'm just gonna type it in\nbecause I don't want to wait for\n\n456\n00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.410\nthe address list to refresh.\n\n457\n00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.240\nAnd I'll go ahead and say OK to that.\n\n458\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.020\nIt's gonna try and find that user\nwhich it didn't find for me.\n\n459\n00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.625\nLet me make sure I can\ntype the whole name.\n\n460\n00:22:33.469 --> 00:22:37.920\nWell, shoot, I might have to get\nthat address list to refresh.\n\n461\n00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.630\nWhen you create a new user, they don't\nshow up in the address list right away and\n\n462\n00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.710\nso it's making it where\nOutlook is not gonna pick it.\n\n463\n00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:44.490\nI'll just do it through\nthe Outlook web app.\n\n464\n00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.140\nThat's another way we can go about it.\n\n465\n00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.650\nWhen you're looking at your mailbox\nhere in the Outlook web app,\n\n466\n00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:50.070\nyou can go up to your name.\n\n467\n00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.450\nAnd if you click on that, you'll see\nOpen another mailbox right there.\n\n468\n00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:58.230\nAnd the nice part is this one is\npulling straight from the server and so\n\n469\n00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.730\nit should have that information already.\n\n470\n00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.353\nIf it doesn't,\nI'll just have to force my address list.\n\n471\n00:23:01.353 --> 00:23:03.280\nThere it goes, yep, so it found it.\n\n472\n00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.570\nAnd I can choose Open, and now it's\ngonna open that other mailbox, and\n\n473\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.480\nI can see info.\n\n474\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.350\nSo when email comes in, this is the first\ntime I've logged in, so I've gotta pick\n\n475\n00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:18.120\na time zone, we'll go with US Eastern, and\nnow I'll be in that generic info mailbox.\n\n476\n00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.460\nAnd I can add this\npermission to other users.\n\n477\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.490\nThe problem with OWA is it opens\nit in a separate window, so\n\n478\n00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.930\nI've got my mail here and\nI've got Info over here.\n\n479\n00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.570\nIf you open it in Outlook,\nthe actual client,\n\n480\n00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.690\nit can have both mailboxes open at the\nsame time and that's kind of convenient.\n\n481\n00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:34.280\nI just have to wait for\n\n482\n00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.860\nmy address list to update, or go and\nforce the address list to update.\n\n483\n00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.830\nBut otherwise I've now\ngot this shared mailbox.\n\n484\n00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.840\nPeople can email info@lab.itpro.tv and\nit will go right here, and\n\n485\n00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.580\nI might have five or ten, however many\nservice reps that are all monitoring that.\n\n486\n00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.510\nAnd when one person handles an email,\nthey can just archive it or\n\n487\n00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:55.020\ndelete it when they're done, and now\nother people know that it's been handled.\n\n488\n00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.270\nSo kind of a nice way to have that central\ngathering place for that information.\n\n489\n00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.854\nThere's another type of recipient\nthat I wanna talk about which is kind\n\n490\n00:24:04.854 --> 00:24:07.540\nof important,\nwhich is the resource recipient.\n\n491\n00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.550\nBut I've talked a little too much and I'm\ngetting kind of short on time on this one.\n\n492\n00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.620\nSo this is probably a good spot for\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n493\n00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.680\nIn this episode, we got a chance\nto see quite a bit of stuff.\n\n494\n00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.670\nWe got to see mailbox users.\n\n495\n00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.770\nThat's the primary recipient\ntype inside of Exchange.\n\n496\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:26.680\nWe got to see mail contacts\nas well as mail users.\n\n497\n00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.850\nRemember that mail contacts\nwere just external users,\n\n498\n00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.150\nexternal email, all external,\nwe just do a reference to it.\n\n499\n00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:38.010\nMail user, that was where we have a local\nuser account but an external mailbox.\n\n500\n00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.580\nAnd then we got a chance to take\na look at shared mailboxes,\n\n501\n00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.400\nanother type of recipient.\n\n502\n00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.190\nStay tuned, though,\ncuz we're gonna do a part two and\n\n503\n00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.370\nI wanna tackle resource recipients.\n\n504\n00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:50.610\nAnd these are things like rooms and\nprojectors, equipment, stuff like that\n\n505\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.320\nthat we wanna make available and\nkeep track of inside of Exchange.\n\n506\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.750\nIt's some really cool functionality, so\nwe'll check that out in the next episode.\n\n507\n00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.820\nBut for now, we'll go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n508\n00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.994\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n509\n00:25:02.994 --> 00:25:08.440\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:12.682\nGood morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening.\n\n5\n00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:15.142\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.142 --> 00:00:16.665\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n7\n00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:20.580\nback again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n8\n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.740\nAnd because I can't seem to keep myself\nquiet, we're actually jumping into part\n\n9\n00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.570\ntwo of the last episode, which was\ncovering recipients inside of Exchange.\n\n10\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.250\nI rambled on a little too long and\n\n11\n00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.600\nI didn't have a chance to get\nto the resource mailboxes.\n\n12\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.450\nAnd so we need to take a look at those\ntoday, because they are important,\n\n13\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.311\nthey are on the exam.\n\n14\n00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:40.401\nIt is something that as administrator's\nwe'll typically have to set up for\n\n15\n00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:43.411\nour users, and then they can start to\nuse them and take advantage of them.\n\n16\n00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:47.391\nSo, I guess, before I get ahead of myself,\nwhat the heck is a resource mailbox?\n\n17\n00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:52.391\nWell, Exchange, deep down inside,\nis really just an email server, right?\n\n18\n00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:55.931\nIt does email, it receives email, it sends\nemail, it sorts it into email boxes and\n\n19\n00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:57.360\nthat's that.\n\n20\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.380\nBut, Microsoft over the years has added\non, improved it to create a full-on\n\n21\n00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.360\ncollaboration suite that\ncan do all sorts of things.\n\n22\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.940\nWell, one of the things that it does\nreally well, is it's a calendar server.\n\n23\n00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.800\nEvery user has their own calendar.\n\n24\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.090\nAnd you can have group calendars for\nyour company, your departments, so\n\n25\n00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.300\nthat everybody can see what's\ngoing on in the organization.\n\n26\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.580\nWell, one of the things that we typically\nput on calendars, are meetings.\n\n27\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.570\nTons of meetings, right?\n\n28\n00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.510\nI can't even begin to tell you guys how\nmany meetings I go to in a given week.\n\n29\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.550\nSo, we start scheduling meetings.\n\n30\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.200\nWell, where do you have your meeting?\n\n31\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.740\nYou probably have a conference room or\ntwo.\n\n32\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.850\nAnd other people wanna schedule meetings.\n\n33\n00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.120\nYou wanna schedule meetings.\n\n34\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.590\nAnd now we have conflicts.\n\n35\n00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.110\nSo we need a way to track things like\nconference rooms, projectors, laptops,\n\n36\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.230\nother equipment that we\nhave in limited supply.\n\n37\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.300\nThat we wanna make sure that\nwe don't over allocate.\n\n38\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.840\nWe have two people wanting\nthe same equipment or\n\n39\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.750\nthe same room at the same time, and\nresource mailboxes let us do that.\n\n40\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.720\nWhen you create a resource mailbox,\nwhat you're doing is you're creating\n\n41\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.870\nbasically like an email user\nthat represents that item.\n\n42\n00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.240\nAnd then we can book it into\nmeetings into our calendar\n\n43\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.450\nto show that it's reserved\nat certain times.\n\n44\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.240\nAnd Exchange does a great job of that.\n\n45\n00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.360\nAnd it's one of the extra recipients\nthat we have in Exchange, and\n\n46\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.500\nthat's why we're kind of\ncovering it here in this section.\n\n47\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.661\nSo, let me show you how they work.\n\n48\n00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:15.973\nI'm logged into my\nExchange Administration Center here, and\n\n49\n00:02:15.973 --> 00:02:19.981\nunder Recipients, you'll see a recipient\ntype in here called Resources.\n\n50\n00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:23.630\nAnd when you jump into Resources, if you\nhaven't used this, it will be empty.\n\n51\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.850\nBut you can come in and\nyou can create your resources as needed.\n\n52\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.550\nNow, the resources you make are up to you.\n\n53\n00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.660\nMicrosoft really just divides them into\ntwo categories, rooms and equipment.\n\n54\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.020\nSo when I hit the plus sign here,\nI pick, is this gonna be a room or\n\n55\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.840\nan equipment mailbox?\n\n56\n00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.580\nNow in reality, there's not much\ndifference between the two,\n\n57\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.790\non the backend in Exchange,\nthere's not much different.\n\n58\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.920\nThe icon is different when you\nsee the contact in the list.\n\n59\n00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.110\nAnd rooms have a capacity,\n\n60\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.950\na certain amount of people that\ncan be in them, equipment doesn't.\n\n61\n00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.440\nThat's really the only\ndifference between the two, but\n\n62\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.350\nit is a visual differentiator and\nthat kind of helps our end users.\n\n63\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.230\nSo, you'd come through and\ndefine your rooms first, and\n\n64\n00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.770\nthen define your equipment and\nget those kind of set in.\n\n65\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.849\nFor rooms,\nyou're just gonna give it a name.\n\n66\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.880\nSo I might have conference room a,\nb and c.\n\n67\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.700\nSo I might create Conference Room.\n\n68\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.135\nWow, my spelling is amazing today.\n\n69\n00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:17.840\n[LAUGH] It's just gonna get\nworse from here, isn't it?\n\n70\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.350\nSo I might have Conference Room C,\nConference Room A,\n\n71\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.670\nConference Room B, whatever.\n\n72\n00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.850\nI create those, and I give them a name.\n\n73\n00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.600\nYou can give them an alias.\n\n74\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.800\nSo I might just call this one\nlike confc or something, and\n\n75\n00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.970\nthen you can pick an OU\nwhere they're gonna reside.\n\n76\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.730\nThere is actually a user\naccount tied to these and so\n\n77\n00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.990\nyou might want to put that into\na particular organizational unit.\n\n78\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.020\nThere needs to be a user account attached,\n\n79\n00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.160\nbecause this is kind of\nlike a shared mailbox.\n\n80\n00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.330\nYou might need to change something.\n\n81\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.500\nYou might need to cancel somebody's\nreservation of a room, and somebody will\n\n82\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.040\nhave to be able to open that conference\nroom up to be able to change it.\n\n83\n00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.335\nSo that's why there's a user account.\n\n84\n00:03:50.335 --> 00:03:51.550\nYou can specify a location.\n\n85\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.980\nSo this one might be at\nthe ITProTV Studios, or somewhere else.\n\n86\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.390\nYou can give it a phone number,\nand you can give it a capacity.\n\n87\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.330\nThat's important because in Outlook,\n\n88\n00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.800\nwe have what's called\nthe Meeting Assistant utility.\n\n89\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.590\nAnd when we go to schedule a meeting,\nif you have 50 people being invited, and\n\n90\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.870\nyou go to pick a meeting room,\n\n91\n00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.060\nit'll actually filter it based on\nwhether the room is big enough.\n\n92\n00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.660\nSo if I have 50 people, and\nI say this room has a capacity of 20,\n\n93\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.390\nit'll hide this one from the list.\n\n94\n00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.500\nPretty cool, right?\n\n95\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.430\nIf I leave the capacity empty, though,\nit'll just always show up, and\n\n96\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.330\nthen you can pick it.\n\n97\n00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.779\nBut it is a good idea to put the\ncapacities there to help with selecting.\n\n98\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.640\nThen it's got booking requests.\n\n99\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.970\nWho's allowed to book this?\n\n100\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.175\nBy default, anybody can book the room,\nand as long as it's available,\n\n101\n00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:39.850\nit'll automatically accept it and\nput the reservation in there.\n\n102\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.580\nBut you might not want that, right?\n\n103\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.490\nYou might want to have certain employees\nwho are responsible for booking the rooms,\n\n104\n00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.880\nmaybe you have a Facilities Manager or\nsomething.\n\n105\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.180\nAnd so you can come in and you can select\nwho's allowed to accept or decline those.\n\n106\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.460\nAnd then what's gonna happen is that\nperson will just need to periodically open\n\n107\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.330\nthis mailbox, look at the requests and\ngo through and\n\n108\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.150\napprove or deny those requests.\n\n109\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.310\nBut I'm gonna leave mine to automatic.\n\n110\n00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.640\nI don't care who uses the room just\nas long as they don't double book it.\n\n111\n00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.612\nThere are a few more options you can go if\nyou really wanna customize like the email\n\n112\n00:05:08.612 --> 00:05:10.490\naddress that's attached to it or whatever.\n\n113\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.110\nBut for most people,\nthose are the options that we need, and so\n\n114\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.500\nwe can get those set, and just hit Save,\nand now I'll have a conference room.\n\n115\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.700\nEquipment is very similar.\n\n116\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.070\nThe only difference with equipment\nis we don't really have a capacity.\n\n117\n00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.790\nSo if I go up here and hit that plus\nsign and do equipment, I can add in,\n\n118\n00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.940\nmaybe I've got a shared laptop,\na projector, some kind of cart.\n\n119\n00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.040\nWho knows what we have?\n\n120\n00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.930\nSo, I'll just say I've got some kind\nof laptop I want to be available.\n\n121\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.900\nAnd, we can specify whether it or\nnot it automatically accepts.\n\n122\n00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.242\nNotice I don't put a location for\nthis, and I don't put a capacity,\n\n123\n00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:45.580\ncuz it's not a room, it's just a piece\nof equipment that can move around.\n\n124\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.990\nAnd you can designate delegates\nwho are responsible for\n\n125\n00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.000\nmanaging the equipment, all right.\n\n126\n00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.410\nSo, I'll go ahead and save that one.\n\n127\n00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.980\nAnd so now I've got some of\nthese resource contacts created.\n\n128\n00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.650\nWhat do I need to do from here?\n\n129\n00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.600\nNot much.\n\n130\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.500\nFrom here, it really manages itself.\n\n131\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.330\nIt's kind of neat how the system works.\n\n132\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.780\nFor an end user, they go into Outlook, and\n\n133\n00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.060\nI'll use the Outlook web app\nhere to do this on mine.\n\n134\n00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.490\nAnd when they go into their system,\nthey can switch to the counter view, and\n\n135\n00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.570\nthey can start to create meetings.\n\n136\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.080\nIn the full Outlook client,\nyou've got the full Meeting Wizard.\n\n137\n00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.090\nIt's really impressive cuz you can see\neverybody's schedules and all of that.\n\n138\n00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.590\nBut here inside of OWA,\nit's a little more limited.\n\n139\n00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.260\nIf I create a new event,\nI can start to schedule this.\n\n140\n00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.610\nSo I'll say this is some kind\nof kick off meeting, and\n\n141\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.640\nI can specify where I want that to be.\n\n142\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.270\nAnd for the location,\nI can type in a name, or\n\n143\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.510\nI've got this add room button over here.\n\n144\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.420\nAnd I can just hit add room, and what\nit's doing is it's looking at the time\n\n145\n00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.020\nthat I've selected, and it's looking\nat the amount of attendees that I have.\n\n146\n00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.230\nAnd it's listing for me rooms that\nare big enough, and rooms that are free.\n\n147\n00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.920\nSee how all of these say free beside them?\n\n148\n00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.400\nA room might already be booked\nduring a certain time, right?\n\n149\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.690\nSo if I create a meeting,\nI'm gonna create this kick off meeting.\n\n150\n00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.711\nI'm gonna put it in Conference Room A.\n\n151\n00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:04.489\nAnd see how it just filled that in and\n\n152\n00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:06.931\nConference Room A becomes an attendee,\nright?\n\n153\n00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:09.391\nThey're listed as somebody\nwho's gonna be attending.\n\n154\n00:07:09.391 --> 00:07:11.671\nAnd then I can start to\ninvite other people.\n\n155\n00:07:11.671 --> 00:07:15.471\nSo I can use the plus sign here and\ngo through and pick other people.\n\n156\n00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:22.191\nI wanna go to my Address List,\nand we'll just take all.\n\n157\n00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.550\nOops, I went to all groups,\nI wanted all contacts.\n\n158\n00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.050\nWe can invite Bill Gates.\n\n159\n00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.080\nHe's a good person to have coming to\nour meeting, we'll invite Bob Denver.\n\n160\n00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.460\nThis will be a celebrity meeting, right?\n\n161\n00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.315\nI'm just gonna start\ninviting these people, and\n\n162\n00:07:35.315 --> 00:07:38.870\nyou'll see as I look down here,\nhere's laptop, here's projector, right?\n\n163\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.680\nSo I can start to reserve equipment too.\n\n164\n00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.490\nI'm adding all of these\npeople as attendees.\n\n165\n00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.270\nNow what's gonna happen is this is\ngonna send out a meeting invite\n\n166\n00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.560\nto all these people.\n\n167\n00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.550\nWell, Christopher Walken, Bill Gates,\nBob Denver, they're gonna get the invite.\n\n168\n00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.110\nAnd they can accept it, or\ndecline it, or say maybe.\n\n169\n00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.090\nBut, laptop is gonna\nreceive the invite and\n\n170\n00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.940\nConference Room A is gonna\nreceive the invite, and\n\n171\n00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.550\nthey're gonna automatically accept it,\nunless they're booked.\n\n172\n00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.280\nIf they're booked already,\nthey'll decline it.\n\n173\n00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.420\nAnd I'll get a message saying they\ndeclined, and that'll be my hint to go and\n\n174\n00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.640\nbook a different room, or\nfind a different computer.\n\n175\n00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.470\nSo, that's that kind of way\nthat we keep track of that.\n\n176\n00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.780\nAnd then we can specify other information\nhere and then we can save our meeting.\n\n177\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.060\nSo this one is good,\nI'll go ahead and send it.\n\n178\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.330\nBut, even before I send it,\nI can go into Scheduling Assistant, and\n\n179\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.620\nin the Scheduling Assistant,\n\n180\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.260\nit's gonna help look at those attendees\nand try and find times that they're free.\n\n181\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.260\nSo, like, if that laptop is booked during\nthis time, I can come in here and look and\n\n182\n00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.090\nsay, all right, maybe it's booked here.\n\n183\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.412\nWhen is it available?\n\n184\n00:08:36.412 --> 00:08:40.700\nAnd it'll show me rooms and equipment,\nthen I can look for time slots when they\n\n185\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.940\nare available, and start to pick\nthat best opportunity for me.\n\n186\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.850\nSo I'm gonna leave this one booked, and\nI'll go ahead and send those invites out.\n\n187\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.026\nNow, the invites go out, the users are\ngonna be pending, but the equipment and\n\n188\n00:08:53.026 --> 00:08:55.471\nthe rooms, they'll automatically accept.\n\n189\n00:08:55.471 --> 00:09:00.249\nSo that should happen pretty quickly,\nand when I, whoops, when I pull that\n\n190\n00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:04.971\nmeeting back up, I can see it's scheduled,\nright, I did, what did I do?\n\n191\n00:09:04.971 --> 00:09:08.610\n11:00 AM to 11:30, so\nit's just a really short meeting.\n\n192\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.111\nIt's up and it's going so\nwe should be in business there,\n\n193\n00:09:11.111 --> 00:09:12.870\nI've got my kick-off meeting.\n\n194\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.270\nTerribly exciting, right?\n\n195\n00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.520\nBut if I go and\ntry to create another meeting.\n\n196\n00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.980\nSo I'll create another one.\n\n197\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.700\nAnd if I try and book it and\noverlap that time, right?\n\n198\n00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.150\nWhen I go to add a room, see how\nConference Room A doesn't show up anymore?\n\n199\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.380\nIt's gone, right?\n\n200\n00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.620\nIt's gone because it's already booked\nduring that time, I can't pick it,\n\n201\n00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.330\nit's not free.\n\n202\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.210\nAnd if I go to my attendees and\nI start to add in people, right?\n\n203\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:42.480\nSo I can come in here to my attendees,\nand I'll find that laptop.\n\n204\n00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.840\nNow I will see the laptop, and\nwhen I add the laptop in as an attendee,\n\n205\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.080\nit's gonna let me do it, right?\n\n206\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.950\nSo there it is, but\nthat attendee is actually busy.\n\n207\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.460\nNow, I don't know it here.\n\n208\n00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.610\nIf I hit Send, it's gonna send to that\nperson and it's gonna bounce back and\n\n209\n00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.860\nsay nope, they decline, they're busy, and\n\n210\n00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.960\nthat's where that\nScheduling Assistant comes in.\n\n211\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.170\nIf I go to my Scheduling Assistant,\nI can see that laptop, and\n\n212\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.570\nI can see that there's a kickoff\nmeeting at that same time.\n\n213\n00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.710\nWhen I take a look,\nlaptop is showing as busy.\n\n214\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.450\nAnd so I can look at laptop's calendar.\n\n215\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.080\nWhen are they not busy?\n\n216\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.870\nOh well, it's available at 12, so\n\n217\n00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.730\nmaybe I'll just move my\nmeeting forward to 12, right?\n\n218\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.890\nWhen that person is available, and\nthat'll take care of that for me.\n\n219\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.771\nAnd I can say, okay, and now I know that,\n\n220\n00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:28.990\nthat laptop will be available and\nnot busy in the other meeting.\n\n221\n00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.550\nSo we can send that along and\noff it goes, right?\n\n222\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.950\nSo, that's how resource mailboxes\nare used, the end users,\n\n223\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:36.790\nit's easy for them, right?\n\n224\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.290\nThey just use it right\nhere inside of Outlook.\n\n225\n00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.350\nIt's all in the GUI, it's no big deal.\n\n226\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.250\nFor Administrators, there's two things\nwe need to be worried about, right?\n\n227\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.450\nOne is creating them, right?\n\n228\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.802\nSo we saw, that's easy enough, right?\n\n229\n00:10:46.802 --> 00:10:48.642\nWe go into Resources and we add them in.\n\n230\n00:10:48.642 --> 00:10:53.094\nAnd then two, is dictating whether or\nnot they automatically accept invites or\n\n231\n00:10:53.094 --> 00:10:57.420\nwhether they're managed, and so you\nmight have to come in and change these.\n\n232\n00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.870\nLike, if I see a lot of contention for\n\n233\n00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.120\nthe laptop,\nI might need to edit that resource.\n\n234\n00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.490\nAnd when you jump in there.\n\n235\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.630\nit's really like a user mailbox,\nthere's only so many options, but\n\n236\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.260\nyou can set who the booking delegates are,\nright?\n\n237\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.770\nAnd this is who's allowed to deal with\nthis, by default and accepting everything,\n\n238\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.330\nI can change that and\nspecify the users who manage it.\n\n239\n00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:21.210\nYou can also set booking options, and\nsee how it says allow repeated meetings?\n\n240\n00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.030\nI might not want to allow somebody\nto do a recurring meeting\n\n241\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.620\nthat books this room over,\nand over, and over again.\n\n242\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.810\nI can turn that off or leave it on.\n\n243\n00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.650\nWe can restrict it to only allowing\nscheduling during business hours, right?\n\n244\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.560\nI don't want people booking\nthis room at midnight.\n\n245\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.170\nJust have it during the business hours.\n\n246\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.360\nWe can always decline if the end\ndate is beyond this limit, right?\n\n247\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.700\nIf I say, right here, the booking times.\n\n248\n00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.550\nIf I say, I don't want them to be\nable to book nine months in advance,\n\n249\n00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.530\nwe want it to be limited.\n\n250\n00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:50.470\nSo, here it's got a limit of 180 days, or\nwhat does that work out to, six months.\n\n251\n00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.550\nSo, if they try and book something beyond\nsix months, we can automatically decline.\n\n252\n00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.171\nAnd then you got a maximum duration.\n\n253\n00:11:56.171 --> 00:12:00.191\nWhat's the longest meeting, or the longest\ntime you want somebody to book a laptop?\n\n254\n00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:03.490\nDo I want somebody to be able to book\nthat laptop for two weeks in a row?\n\n255\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.460\nNo, you probably want to keep\nthat a little more limited.\n\n256\n00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.750\nSo we could limit to a 4 hours,\nor 24 hours, or whatever.\n\n257\n00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.850\nAll done right here.\n\n258\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.231\nYou can also tweak things like the email\naddress, the contact information,\n\n259\n00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:15.490\nlike location and all that.\n\n260\n00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.500\nI didn't see that in the wizard\nwhen I added the box.\n\n261\n00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.629\nNow I can do it right here.\n\n262\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.440\nAnd then other delegations as far as\npeople who might be able to send on behalf\n\n263\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.000\nof that mailbox.\n\n264\n00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.890\nSo all these things can be tweaked to\ncustomize that resource record, and\n\n265\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.510\nget it to work the way we want, right?\n\n266\n00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.721\nBut as an administrator, it really\njust comes down to creating these.\n\n267\n00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:33.681\nYou get them put in place,\nand you get them there.\n\n268\n00:12:33.681 --> 00:12:36.360\nNow in real life land,\nlet me tell you what's gonna happen.\n\n269\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.532\nYou're gonna set all this up.\n\n270\n00:12:37.532 --> 00:12:41.050\nYou're gonna set it up to be automatic and\nit's gonna work great.\n\n271\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:46.720\nAnd then one day, an end user\nis gonna book a conference room.\n\n272\n00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.890\nAnd then afterwards, your CEO is gonna try\nand book that same conference room, and\n\n273\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.957\nthey're gonna say well, it's busy,\nI'll want to kick them out.\n\n274\n00:12:53.957 --> 00:12:57.830\nAll right, well if we have it\nset to auto accept like this.\n\n275\n00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.212\nIt's not gonna kick them out, it's booked,\n\n276\n00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:01.300\nthe CEO's gonna have to\npick a different time.\n\n277\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.940\nBut in real life, we know, CEO gets\npriority, we want them to have that room.\n\n278\n00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.900\nSo, we're gonna have to get in and\ncancel that.\n\n279\n00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.850\nWell, by default, we have to do it,\nthe administrators, so as an admin,\n\n280\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.590\nyou've got to go in and do that.\n\n281\n00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.200\nBut if you don't want to get\ninvolved with all of that,\n\n282\n00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.410\nit's a good idea to have\na facilities person or\n\n283\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.830\nsome other kind of like an office manager,\nand have them be responsible for it.\n\n284\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.130\nSo we want to make sure we add them\nas delegates to the mailboxes.\n\n285\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.240\nSo then they can say, all right, I'll just\ngo into OWA, and I'll go to open another\n\n286\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.430\nuser's folder, and I'll open up that\nprojector, or laptop, or conference room.\n\n287\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.330\nAnd then I'll just go decline\nthe meeting that's already there, and\n\n288\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.110\nthen tell the CEO to come back in and\nbook it.\n\n289\n00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.120\nThey'll book it and\nit'll be in business, right?\n\n290\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.160\nSo, that happens a lot.\n\n291\n00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.960\nSo just expect to add a delegate,\notherwise your gonna be getting\n\n292\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.260\nhelp desk support tickets and you'll have\nto become the scheduling coordinator.\n\n293\n00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.970\nWhich is not something an IT\nperson really wants to mess with.\n\n294\n00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.810\nI don't know.\nMaybe you do like that.\n\n295\n00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.582\nI don't, so [LAUGH] definitely something\nthat we're gonna have to put in place.\n\n296\n00:13:57.582 --> 00:14:02.220\nAll right, well,\nthose are resource mailboxes and\n\n297\n00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.660\nthere's not really much\nelse to cover on them.\n\n298\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.530\nYou can get really creative and\nset them up to work however you want.\n\n299\n00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.260\nI use examples of laptops and projectors.\n\n300\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.540\nIt might be things like moving vans,\nor trucks.\n\n301\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.550\nIt could be all sorts of crazy things\nthat you want to book in there,\n\n302\n00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:15.410\nyou just set it up.\n\n303\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.100\nExchange treats them all equally.\n\n304\n00:14:18.312 --> 00:14:20.980\nAll right, well, that's about all\nI've got for resource mailboxes,\n\n305\n00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.000\nso we'll wrap things up here.\n\n306\n00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.210\nIn this segment, we got a chance to\nsee setting up conference rooms,\n\n307\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.620\nas well as setting up equipment, and\nhow we can have that shared calendar.\n\n308\n00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.980\nHow the Meeting Minder can\ntake advantage of that and\n\n309\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.090\nhelp to find the best place for\nthat meeting and get things scheduled.\n\n310\n00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.650\nIt's really cool functionality.\n\n311\n00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.170\nOnly takes a few minutes to get it set up,\n\n312\n00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.610\nso definitely something you'll\nwant to take advantage of.\n\n313\n00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.032\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n314\n00:14:41.032 --> 00:14:44.391\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet,\nand I'll see you next

00:00:15.510\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.520\nI'm your host, Don Pizet.\n\n5\n00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.460\nBack again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013 and\n\n6\n00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.340\nin this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at distribution groups,\n\n7\n00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.140\nwhich are kind of an important\npart of exchange.\n\n8\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.210\nBecause often times we find ourselves\nsending an email not just to one person\n\n9\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.840\nbut to a group of people and\nif you want to sit there and\n\n10\n00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.740\nadd people in your two field over,\nover and over again, you can do that.\n\n11\n00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.100\nBut if we create a distribution group, we\ncan quickly and easily send one email and\n\n12\n00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.810\nhave it go to multiple recipients.\n\n13\n00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.050\nIt's a lot easier than setting up things\nlike shared mailboxes and all that.\n\n14\n00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.830\nYou just fire off an email and\nit hits all the people involved.\n\n15\n00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.720\nAnd the cool part is, with the\ndistribution group, you can move people\n\n16\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.520\ninto it, and you can take people out of it\nto determine who's getting those emails.\n\n17\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.440\nSo it really does simplify things like\nsharing incoming email across users.\n\n18\n00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.280\nSo there's a ton of different uses for it.\n\n19\n00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.520\nMost of you guys are familiar with\ndistribution groups at this point so\n\n20\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.040\nI'm not gonna harp on that.\n\n21\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.870\nBut, there are actually three different\ntypes of distribution group or\n\n22\n00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.670\nmailing list that we can\nuse inside of Exchange and\n\n23\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.800\nI wanna show you guys those groups and\nshow you how they can be used and\n\n24\n00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.320\nwhat their differences are, all right So,\nI'm gonna start right here in my\n\n25\n00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320\nExchange administration center and\nbasically I'm logged in.\n\n26\n00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.360\nI've got a couple of recipients\nthat are sitting here.\n\n27\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.730\nThere's me, Jane Smith, John Doe, right?\n\n28\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.895\nHowever recipients that you guys have.\n\n29\n00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:30.690\nAnd if I find that I'm constantly\nemailing some of the same people over and\n\n30\n00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.360\nover again, I might choose to\ncreate a distribution group.\n\n31\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.385\nNow end users can do this.\n\n32\n00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:39.870\nEnd users can fire up Microsoft Outlook\nand they can add users to a group.\n\n33\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.910\nAnd they can do that\nuntil the cows come home.\n\n34\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.520\nRight, but that's being stored\nin their local contacts.\n\n35\n00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.170\nAnd the contacts that\nare part of their mail box,\n\n36\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.380\nit's not shared across the entire company.\n\n37\n00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.566\nSo if I want something\nthat everybody can use,\n\n38\n00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:54.040\nI need to create it here in\nthe Exchange administration center.\n\n39\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.020\nUnder recipients,\nyou'll see groups right up top.\n\n40\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.820\nWe can go under groups and\n\n41\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.485\nright here is where we can add\nin the different group types.\n\n42\n00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:02.553\nAnd when we go to hit this\nlittle plus sign over here,\n\n43\n00:02:02.553 --> 00:02:06.415\nthat's where we'll see our three choices\nand three different types of groups.\n\n44\n00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:08.285\nWell, let's start with\nthe standard one first.\n\n45\n00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:10.305\nThis guy right here, a distribution group.\n\n46\n00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:13.585\nA distribution group is designed\nto be used for email purposes.\n\n47\n00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:16.115\nI want to be able to send\nan email to one address and\n\n48\n00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:18.025\nhave it go to more than one person, right?\n\n49\n00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:19.375\nWell, what would be an example of this?\n\n50\n00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:20.419\nI might have something like.\n\n51\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.960\nAn executives group, right?\n\n52\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.410\nSo all of my executive\nemployees go in here,\n\n53\n00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.220\nand this is the one email list that I\ncan send to and hit all the executives.\n\n54\n00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.850\nSo I can give it an alias.\n\n55\n00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.120\nAnd then I can specify\nwho's gonna be in it.\n\n56\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.890\nNow, when I look at some\nof my other options here,\n\n57\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.340\nI've got the organizational unit\nwhere this group is gonna be stored.\n\n58\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.040\nIt is a group in the Active Directory.\n\n59\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.780\nAnd so I might wanna browse and\nchoose where I want that to reside.\n\n60\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.850\nI'll put mine in the ITProTV OU since\nthat's where my company's residing.\n\n61\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.330\nAnd then I can specify who owns it.\n\n62\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.550\nNow, ownership is gonna default to you,\nwhoever's creating it.\n\n63\n00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.710\nWhoever creates the group,\nthey're the owner.\n\n64\n00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.950\nAnd as the owner, that means you have\nthe permission to put people in,\n\n65\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.270\ntake people out,\nto disable the group if you want.\n\n66\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.710\nYou control that group.\n\n67\n00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.610\nYou can have more than one owner,\nand the owner can be a person or\n\n68\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.450\nthe owner can be another group.\n\n69\n00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.490\nWe can have one group in charge of\nanother group if you really wanted to.\n\n70\n00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.210\nBut, the owner is just important to\ndetermine who is able to manage ownership,\n\n71\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.900\nat least in the beginning.\n\n72\n00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.090\nAfter that, we have who the members are.\n\n73\n00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.250\nNow the default members\nare nobody except the owner.\n\n74\n00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.550\nSee how it says add\ngroup owners as members.\n\n75\n00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.360\nWell, I might be the network\nadministrator, but I'm not an executive so\n\n76\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.910\nI don't want to be a member of the group.\n\n77\n00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.540\nI don't want to get the executive emails.\n\n78\n00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.068\nSo I'm gonna uncheck that.\n\n79\n00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:43.890\nAnd now I would come through an add\nwho ever the executives were.\n\n80\n00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.780\nSo maybe Jane Smith is our CIO.\n\n81\n00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.940\nSo, I'm gonna come in here and hit plus,\nand I'll add in Jane Smith and\n\n82\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.310\nany other users that I want, and\nnow they're gonna be in that group.\n\n83\n00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.850\nSo if I send an email to this\nexecutives distribution group,\n\n84\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.301\nshe's gonna get a copy of it.\n\n85\n00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:04.580\nAnd maybe old John Doe is our CTO,\nor some other title.\n\n86\n00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.630\nI can add him in and\nnow both of them will get the emails.\n\n87\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.430\nNow, they are getting\nseparate copies of the email.\n\n88\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.640\nSo, if one of them marks it as read,\nit's still unread for the other, and\n\n89\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.070\nif one of them deletes it,\nit's still present for the others.\n\n90\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.437\nIt's actually stored more than\nonce in the mailbox database.\n\n91\n00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:23.157\nSo it's still separate but\nI have one address to be able to reach and\n\n92\n00:04:23.157 --> 00:04:25.710\ncontact these people, all right.\n\n93\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.140\nNow the neat thing about this\ndistribution groups is, by default,\n\n94\n00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.990\nthe owner controls who's in it.\n\n95\n00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.170\nSo if I make a regular user,\nif I make Jane, the owner.\n\n96\n00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.800\nJane can go and add and\nremove people from the group on her own.\n\n97\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.520\nShe can do it right from inside\nof Outlook or Outlook web app.\n\n98\n00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.695\nAnd it really does make\nlife a little easier there,\n\n99\n00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:43.810\ncuz we don't have to administer it.\n\n100\n00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.260\nBut you can actually set up cool things,\nlike self service groups,\n\n101\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.980\nwhere people can opt in and\nopt out of the group at their leisure.\n\n102\n00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.150\nI'm going to save that for\na little bit later, but\n\n103\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.960\nyou'll see those options right\ndown here where it's asking,\n\n104\n00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.390\nshould anybody be able to join, or\nshould anybody be able to leave?\n\n105\n00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.320\nAnd the default is, well you've gotta\nbe approved by the group owner.\n\n106\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.050\nThe group owner controls that.\n\n107\n00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.730\nBut you can actually set it to be\nautomatic where people can kind of move\n\n108\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.060\nin and out.\n\n109\n00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.510\nAnd, you know actually, I said the default\nhad to be approved, but you'll see\n\n110\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.980\nhere it's actually defaulting to not\nbeing approved so I can switch that.\n\n111\n00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.380\nAnd I'm gonna make it where the owner\nis the person who has to do it.\n\n112\n00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.610\nSo we can kinda tweak these settings.\n\n113\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.210\nI'll revisit these in a few minutes and\nwe'll get to see it in action.\n\n114\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.350\nBut once it's done, I can hit Save, and\nI've now got a distribution group, and\n\n115\n00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.910\nif I go back into the properties\nof the distribution group,\n\n116\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.030\nI can see what its email address is.\n\n117\n00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.370\nIt's gonna show up in my global address\nbook, so anybody who goes into Outlook or\n\n118\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.220\nOWA and pulls up the global address list,\nthey'll be able to find\n\n119\n00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.590\nthis executives group in there and email\nit, and then it'll hit all the executives.\n\n120\n00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.410\nIf we edit that, we can go back in here\nand look at our email addresses and\n\n121\n00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.470\nit should have,\nassuming it's not already taken,\n\n122\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.850\nit should've assigned it\nexecutives@itprotv.net.\n\n123\n00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.330\nIt uses the alias that I put in to\ndetermine what that email address\n\n124\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.790\nis going to be.\n\n125\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.150\nSo there's that alias I\nput in when I created it.\n\n126\n00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.170\nAnd over here,\nif I go to my email options,\n\n127\n00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.700\nwe can see it got executives@itprotv.net.\n\n128\n00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.770\nI can change that.\n\n129\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.740\nI'm gonna have more than one.\n\n130\n00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.030\nI might want to put in some other\naliases on my own just in case.\n\n131\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.900\nYou know,\nmaybe somebody emails exec@itprotv.net,\n\n132\n00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.280\nor maybe I've got more than one domain and\nI want to punch those in.\n\n133\n00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.050\nSo I can fill all that stuff out and\nit'll get put in there, right?\n\n134\n00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.250\nThere are a few other interesting\nthings you can tailor in here.\n\n135\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.200\nFor example, delivery management.\n\n136\n00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.910\nNotice the default setting for this group.\n\n137\n00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.720\nOnly senders inside my\norganization can use it.\n\n138\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.280\nWhat if I'm trying to create\na distribution group that I want\n\n139\n00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.540\na lot of people to be able to use,\nlike the internet?\n\n140\n00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.290\nMaybe in my company, I decide that I\nwant to have an email address called\n\n141\n00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.320\ninformation or sales,\nmaybe I have a sales team.\n\n142\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.720\nAnd so\nI want to create a sales@itprotv.net.\n\n143\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.160\nAnd I want anybody on the internet\nto be able to email it.\n\n144\n00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.160\nWell that's gonna be a problem\nbecause the default setting there,\n\n145\n00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.200\nis that only people in my\norganization can do this.\n\n146\n00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.280\nWe might need to change that setting to\nallow the internet to be able to use it.\n\n147\n00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.860\nLet's run with the sales example.\n\n148\n00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.730\nSo I have a sales department, and\n\n149\n00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.370\nin my sales department I have users that\nare in there and so I want to be able to\n\n150\n00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.880\nsend an email to sales@itprotv.net and\nhave it go to all those people.\n\n151\n00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.280\nAnd I also want it to be\navailable from the internet, so\n\n152\n00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.450\nI know I can whip up\na distribution group and do that.\n\n153\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.640\nBut the odds are, if you've got a sales\ndepartment, you probably already have some\n\n154\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.940\nActive Directory groups that\nare in place that you're using for\n\n155\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.920\npermissions that would be nice if\nyou could use as email groups also.\n\n156\n00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.180\nWell, a distribution group, by default,\ncan only be used for email, and that's it.\n\n157\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.750\nIt can't be used for permissions.\n\n158\n00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.670\nSo it's got one purpose, and\nthat one purpose is email.\n\n159\n00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.538\nBut if I have a group that I want\nto do both email and permissions,\n\n160\n00:07:50.538 --> 00:07:55.640\nthen instead of creating a distributions\ngroup, I should create a security group.\n\n161\n00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.800\nA security group can be used for\nboth, right?\n\n162\n00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.090\nNot just email.\n\n163\n00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.000\nSo it's done right here form\nthe same screen, though.\n\n164\n00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.210\nIf I come back in here and I hit add.\n\n165\n00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.245\nI can choose to add a security group,\nand when I add a security group,\n\n166\n00:08:07.245 --> 00:08:11.440\nnow it's gonna create an active\ndirectory group on the back end.\n\n167\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.490\nAnd so I might create a group\ncalled Sales Department, and\n\n168\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.580\nI might give it an alias of just Sales.\n\n169\n00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.220\nAll right.\n\n170\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.030\nAnd then I can give it that description.\n\n171\n00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.120\nThis is just like the other screen we saw,\nright.\n\n172\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.210\nWe have our owner, we have our members.\n\n173\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.360\nI'll add John Doe to this list.\n\n174\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.160\nAnd we get these people put in,\n\n175\n00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.750\nand then when I save it it's\ngonna create that group.\n\n176\n00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.150\nNow, when I created it I didn't\npoint to it there, I should have.\n\n177\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.000\nIt didn't have that\nautomatic membership stuff.\n\n178\n00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.900\nUsers can't automatically join or\nunjoin a security group.\n\n179\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.220\nYou're either in it or you're not, and\n\n180\n00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.000\nwhoever's the owner of that\ngroup is what tailors that, so\n\n181\n00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.620\nwe don't have that self-service\nportal type kind of configuration.\n\n182\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.200\nBut now I've got this sales group,\nand this sales group is\n\n183\n00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.480\nan actual active directory security group\nthat I can use to assign permissions.\n\n184\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.760\nI can say, anybody who's in the sales\ngroup can print to this printer, or\n\n185\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.590\ncan write to these files.\n\n186\n00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.070\nBut I can also shoot an email\nto sales@itprotv.net,\n\n187\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.760\nand it's gonna go to all these people,\nright.\n\n188\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.505\nSo it's kind of a multi-purpose group,\nI can use it for more than one thing.\n\n189\n00:09:13.505 --> 00:09:17.595\nBut even for this one, I'm gonna\nneed to edit that, and then go into\n\n190\n00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:21.575\nits delivery options to set it so that the\noutside world will be able to email to it.\n\n191\n00:09:21.575 --> 00:09:25.925\nSo when I go to delivery management,\nI can say, senders inside and\n\n192\n00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:27.857\noutside of the organization\nwill be able to send to it.\n\n193\n00:09:27.857 --> 00:09:30.145\nThat's an important part\nto be able to have that.\n\n194\n00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:32.760\nAll right.\n\n195\n00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.630\nSo once we've got that in place,\nnow you've got that distribution group.\n\n196\n00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.240\nPeople can receive email,\nit comes to that main email and\n\n197\n00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.900\nthen it gets distributed out to all\nthe individual mailboxes behind it.\n\n198\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.850\nNow if they reply to that email,\nwho are they replying as?\n\n199\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.760\nWell, they're gonna reply as themselves.\n\n200\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.830\nSo the email might have gone\nto sales@itprotv.net, but\n\n201\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:56.070\nwhen John replies to it,\nhe's gonna reply as John@itprotv.net.\n\n202\n00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.740\nAnd that may be what I want, or\n\n203\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.670\nI might want people to be able\nto send on behalf of the group.\n\n204\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.730\nNow, the group doesn't actually have\na mailbox, so it's a little bit different.\n\n205\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.669\nBut you'll notice when\nwe go into the settings,\n\n206\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.540\nthat you've actually got that option\nwhere you can set delegation.\n\n207\n00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.660\nSo you can allow somebody to use\nthat address when they send.\n\n208\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.970\nSo if we kinda look down the list here,\nyou'll see group delegation, and\n\n209\n00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:22.150\nwe can delegate out whether they have\nsend as or send on behalf of that group.\n\n210\n00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.040\nSo even though it doesn't have a dedicated\nmailbox, we can still send as it, right.\n\n211\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.400\nSo it's kind of a neat thing.\n\n212\n00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.040\nI say it doesn't have a dedicated mailbox.\n\n213\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.160\nIt actually kind of does on the back end.\n\n214\n00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.690\nIt doesn't save the email,\nbut it does exist.\n\n215\n00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.860\nAlright, so those are our first two\ntypes of groups, distribution groups and\n\n216\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.550\nsecurity groups.\n\n217\n00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.710\nRemember the key difference there\nis security groups can be used for\n\n218\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.540\npermissions and email, distribution\ngroups can just be used for email.\n\n219\n00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.590\nNow it is important that you pick\nthe right group type from the beginning\n\n220\n00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.240\ncuz you can't change your mind later.\n\n221\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.180\nThere's no way to convert a distribution\ngroup to a security group or\n\n222\n00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:56.690\nthe other way around.\n\n223\n00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.410\nYou can't convert a security\ngroup to a distribution group.\n\n224\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.740\nSo if you have to change it later on,\n\n225\n00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.740\nYou actually have to create an all new\ngroup set it with the same membership and\n\n226\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.940\nthen delete the other one so\nit's kind of a hassle.\n\n227\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.760\nMake sure you choose\ncorrectly in the beginning.\n\n228\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.360\nAll right the other thing, the other group\nis what's called a dynamic group and\n\n229\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.930\ndynamic groups are the most flexible.\n\n230\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.830\nOne of the problems with these like I\njust set up the sales department group.\n\n231\n00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.430\nRight.\n\n232\n00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:24.010\nSo any time I hire a new salesperson, I've\ngotta add them to this group, don't I?\n\n233\n00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.560\nRight, and that's a bit of a pain.\n\n234\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.590\nIf I'm using templates, then I can\ngo in and I can copy the user and\n\n235\n00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.860\nI can add them, copying the user\nthat's already in this group and\n\n236\n00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.050\nit'll automatically add them to the group,\nright.\n\n237\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:40.810\nBut if I'm using Exchange, right here, for\nexample, let's say I had an IT department\n\n238\n00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:47.320\ngroup, and I went into my active\ndirectory, which is here.\n\n239\n00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.510\nI'll go into my Active Directory, and\nI'll go into my IT organizational unit.\n\n240\n00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.720\nAnd when I go in there, I'll see that\nI'm in IT, and so is Jane Smith.\n\n241\n00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.520\nAnd so I create this IT group,\nand I put us in it.\n\n242\n00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.050\nRight?\n\n243\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.950\nNow people can email the IT department.\n\n244\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.500\nBut when I hire a new employee, I have to\nremember to put them in that group and\n\n245\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.410\nif I'm creating them from the GUI\nthat's not gonna happen, right?\n\n246\n00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.460\nLet me show you.\n\n247\n00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.039\nSo if I go back here, I'm gonna\ncreate a new group that I'll call IT.\n\n248\n00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:20.410\nSo I'm just gonna do a distribution\ngroup and I'll call it IT.\n\n249\n00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.430\nAnd, you know, we'll give an alias.\n\n250\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.310\nAnd I'm gonna browse through\norganizational unit.\n\n251\n00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.730\nI'm gonna put it in the IT\ndepartment there, all right?\n\n252\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:35.078\nAnd then for the members I'll come in\nhere and I'll add Jane and myself.\n\n253\n00:12:37.092 --> 00:12:38.980\nSo let's just get added in there.\n\n254\n00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.930\nThere we go.\nAnd so Jane and I are now in the group.\n\n255\n00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.630\nAnd things are great.\n\n256\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.390\nRight?\nPeople can email the IT department and\n\n257\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.560\nwe're gonna get it.\n\n258\n00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.370\nBut then I hire a new employee and\nso I go over here to mailboxes, and\n\n259\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.680\nI add a new recipient.\n\n260\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.500\nRight, so I'm gonna add a user mailbox.\n\n261\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.230\nAnd this is gonna be, oh I don't know,\n\n262\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.670\nwe'll just do Tom Jones,\nall right, so So tjones.\n\n263\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:06.710\nAnd so we'll give him a first name here\nof Tom and last name of Jones, right?\n\n264\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.475\nAnd for the organizational unit,\nI'm going to browse and put them in IT,\n\n265\n00:13:09.475 --> 00:13:11.605\nbecause Tom's going to be in\nthe IT department with us.\n\n266\n00:13:11.605 --> 00:13:14.980\nAnd then I can give him his login name and\n\n267\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:20.780\nhis password, all right,\nand we'll save that.\n\n268\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:27.040\nNow, Tom's in the IT OU, and the IT\nDistribution Group is in that OU also.\n\n269\n00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.210\nBut, there's nothing that says,\nhey put Tom into that group.\n\n270\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.620\nSo when I go back to my groups, and\n\n271\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.200\nI take a look at my IT department,\nhe's not going to be in it, right.\n\n272\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.140\nSo I have to remember to come back and\nchange this.\n\n273\n00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.450\nThe more distribution groups that people\nare a part of, the harder this becomes.\n\n274\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.225\nIt becomes a real hassle.\n\n275\n00:13:43.225 --> 00:13:47.900\nSo It'd be nice if we could have\ngroups that maintain themselves,\n\n276\n00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.220\nwhere I didn't have to come in and\nadd every new employee.\n\n277\n00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.920\nEvery time I hire somebody, I don't\nwant to have to come in and add them in.\n\n278\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.018\nI just want them to already be there.\n\n279\n00:13:57.018 --> 00:13:59.050\nSo in my scenario,\nI don't have that right now.\n\n280\n00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.440\nA dynamic distribution\ngroup will help me do that.\n\n281\n00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.750\nThe way a dynamic distribution group works\nis it doesn't have a hard-set membership.\n\n282\n00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.090\nWe don't say,\nhere's the members of this group.\n\n283\n00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.820\nInstead, we give it an active directory\nquery, a query that it can run that says,\n\n284\n00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.210\nhere's how you can figure\nout who your membership is.\n\n285\n00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.910\nAnd every time somebody sends\nan email to that group,\n\n286\n00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:21.750\nit does a query to figure\nout who the members are.\n\n287\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.490\nSo it's always up to date and\nwe don't have to remember to do it.\n\n288\n00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.210\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n289\n00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.150\nIf we add new users,\nthey're automatically added.\n\n290\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.050\nIf we fire people, disable accounts,\nthey're automatically removed.\n\n291\n00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.760\nNo maintenance required, all right?\n\n292\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.730\nBut it does require setting\nup a little bit of a query,\n\n293\n00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.450\nwe have to kind of sort that out.\n\n294\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.340\nIn the GUI there's some nice really\neasy drop down boxes we can use, but\n\n295\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.540\nyou can go to the PowerShell\nan you can get really specific.\n\n296\n00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.420\nYou can say give me just people in the IT\ndepartment whose last name starts with\n\n297\n00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.490\nS and who also work in Florida.\n\n298\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.940\nYou can do that right?\n\n299\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.970\nFrom the GUI it's a little\nmore simplified but\n\n300\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.270\nthe GUI actually gives us\nthe key one that we need.\n\n301\n00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.190\nMost of the times dynamic\ndistribution groups are based on\n\n302\n00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.180\norganizational unit membership.\n\n303\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.400\nI can say, I want an IT\ndistribution group that's based on\n\n304\n00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.220\nall the people in the IT department who\nare all gonna be in the IT OU and so\n\n305\n00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.820\nI can just build it right around that and\nit's automatically gonna update.\n\n306\n00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.990\nNow, be careful.\n\n307\n00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.240\nThe more of these groups you create,\n\n308\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.060\nthe more active directory queries\nthat are happening, right?\n\n309\n00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.690\nBecause every time\nsomebody sends an email,\n\n310\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.780\nit's gotta do that query\nto look up the membership.\n\n311\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.040\nSo if this is a really high traffic\naddress, if it's receiving millions of\n\n312\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.770\nemails a day, that can be a little bit\nburdensome on the domain controllers so\n\n313\n00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.480\nyou might have to improve\nyour domain controllers.\n\n314\n00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.860\nJust monitor performance.\n\n315\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.000\nMost people aren't receiving\nemail at that volume and\n\n316\n00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.160\nso it's not a big deal and it'll be\na negligible impact on your server.\n\n317\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.630\nSo let’s create one of these dynamic ones.\n\n318\n00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.070\nI'm gonna delete this IT group that I just\ncreated cuz it does not meet my needs,\n\n319\n00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.350\nright, or wait we'll create a new one.\n\n320\n00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.550\nWe'll do a help desk.\n\n321\n00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.710\nI want a help desk email that\ngoes to all my IT people, right?\n\n322\n00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.470\nSo I'm gonna go to add and this time I'm\ngonna choose dynamic distribution group.\n\n323\n00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.800\nNow notice there's no\ndynamic security group.\n\n324\n00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.800\nIt doesn't support that because It\nwould be an exponential increase,\n\n325\n00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.500\nthe amount of lookups you'd have to do.\n\n326\n00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.878\nEvery time you accessed a file or\na folder,\n\n327\n00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:02.448\nit would have to look up\nthat group membership and\n\n328\n00:16:02.448 --> 00:16:03.500\nthat would just be a nightmare.\n\n329\n00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.640\nSo you can't do that.\n\n330\n00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.050\nBut I can do a dynamic distribution group,\nand it's very similar to the other one.\n\n331\n00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.210\nWe give it a name.\n\n332\n00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.510\nI'll call this one Help Desk.\n\n333\n00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.090\nI'll give it an alias.\n\n334\n00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.858\nI'll just call it helpdesk, or\n\n335\n00:16:13.858 --> 00:16:18.710\nthis could be support if we want it to\nbe our tech support, whatever it is.\n\n336\n00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.940\nWe can specify the organizational\nunit it resides in,\n\n337\n00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.569\nI'll pop this into the IT department.\n\n338\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.550\nWho the owner is, and if I leave it blank,\nit's just gonna make me the owner, so,\n\n339\n00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.890\nI don't have to worry there.\n\n340\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.060\nBut then after that is where\nthe screen gets different.\n\n341\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.138\nHere's where we can start\nto specify our query, okay.\n\n342\n00:16:34.138 --> 00:16:36.170\nAnd the query's made up of two parts.\n\n343\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.924\nThe first part is what type of\nrecipients I wanna get, all right.\n\n344\n00:16:38.924 --> 00:16:44.120\nNow, if I pointed at the IT OU and\nthis group is in the IT OU it kind\n\n345\n00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.980\nof creates a bit of a loop, and I might\nnot want to get other groups and stuff.\n\n346\n00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.420\nSo I'm really just looking for people\nthat have Exchange mailboxes, right?\n\n347\n00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.560\nI might not want contacts or resource\nmailboxes or other things like that so\n\n348\n00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.770\nI can filter those out.\n\n349\n00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.800\nUsually we just want people\nwith mailboxes, all right?\n\n350\n00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.820\nWe don't want anything else.\n\n351\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.570\nThen, we add our rules.\n\n352\n00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.360\nAnd your rule is basically what's\nspecifying the people to find.\n\n353\n00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.550\nSo if I want people who\nare in a particular OU,\n\n354\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.970\nwho work in a particular state,\nI can add these rules in.\n\n355\n00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.550\nYou can add multiple ones.\n\n356\n00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.902\nNow, in the GUI we only\nhave these canned rules.\n\n357\n00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:19.002\nBut from PowerShell, you can actually\nwrite really complex ones and\n\n358\n00:17:19.002 --> 00:17:22.380\ndo whatever you want, but these are some\nof the key ones that we might want.\n\n359\n00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.330\nFor example,\n\n360\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:28.358\nRecipient container, I just want users\nthat have mailboxes that are in the IT OU.\n\n361\n00:17:28.358 --> 00:17:30.582\nAnd so I'm gonna pick that role.\n\n362\n00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:35.930\nThat's the one I want, people in\nthe IT department organizational unit.\n\n363\n00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.458\nAnd now when I save that,\nthis distribution group,\n\n364\n00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:40.540\nI don't have to tell it the membership.\n\n365\n00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.230\nIt just goes and queries the AD, looks\nin that OU and gets those users back.\n\n366\n00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.930\nAnd it should be doing that already, okay?\n\n367\n00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.950\nSo if I edit that, there's not a whole\nheck of a lot that I can change on them.\n\n368\n00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.310\nI'm not gonna see all the membership\nstuff because that's all static.\n\n369\n00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.440\nWell, I mean it's dynamic.\n\n370\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.840\nIt's querying it in the background.\n\n371\n00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.570\nBut I can see membership and\nmodify the query.\n\n372\n00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:03.420\nSo I can tweak that query if I need to,\nto get it set just right, and then we can\n\n373\n00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.050\nadjust our delivery management,\njust like any other distribution group.\n\n374\n00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.160\nI'd probably want to make this one,\npublic, all right.\n\n375\n00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.048\nBut where this gets really cool is\nif I come in and add a new mailbox,\n\n376\n00:18:12.048 --> 00:18:15.059\nit's automatically going to get\nadded to this distribution group.\n\n377\n00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:19.980\nAnd when you take a look at these,\nthat makes life a lot easier.\n\n378\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.800\nSo now, if I were to fire off\nan email to helpdesk@itprotv.net,\n\n379\n00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.780\nit does a query in the background.\n\n380\n00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.231\nIt looks for everybody in that IT OU,\nand that's who the email goes to.\n\n381\n00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:33.480\nAnd if I disable a user,\nit doesn't go to them anymore.\n\n382\n00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.803\nIf I move them out of the OU,\nit doesn't go to them anymore.\n\n383\n00:18:35.803 --> 00:18:39.340\nAnd if I had new users, they're\nautomatically added in, so pretty cool.\n\n384\n00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.511\nWe have to maintain that query.\n\n385\n00:18:40.511 --> 00:18:43.140\nThat's a little bit of extra work,\nall right?\n\n386\n00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.610\nSo, dynamic distribution groups are a\ngreat way to take the load off of us as\n\n387\n00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:47.130\nadministrators.\n\n388\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.690\nThey automatically update.\n\n389\n00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.130\nBut another solution is just to push\nthat load off to our end users and say,\n\n390\n00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.150\nlet's let them deal with it, right?\n\n391\n00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.530\nWe can create distribution groups that\nhave self-service membership, right?\n\n392\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.615\nAnd that's kinda what I\nhighlighted earlier, but\n\n393\n00:19:00.615 --> 00:19:03.096\nlet me show you the kinda details,\nhow we can get this set up.\n\n394\n00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:07.260\nAnd let the end users do the work for us,\ncuz that kinda is nice when it happens.\n\n395\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.880\nSo, let's say, for example,\nthat we've got a distribution group for\n\n396\n00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.320\nsome leadership training we're doing.\n\n397\n00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.970\nRight, so there's gonna be\nsome leadership training, and\n\n398\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.390\nthey want a leadership email address.\n\n399\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:22.450\nSo we create a distribution group and\nwe call it Leadership Training, all right?\n\n400\n00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.740\nAnd the Leadership Training is optional.\n\n401\n00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.440\nUsers can choose to be a part of\nthe training or they can choose not to.\n\n402\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.860\nRight, if they're a leader,\nthey wanna be a part of it.\n\n403\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.675\nIf they're not, then they don't.\n\n404\n00:19:30.675 --> 00:19:33.745\nSo what we don't wanna do, though, is we\ndon't want to have to constantly add or\n\n405\n00:19:33.745 --> 00:19:35.355\nremove people from the list.\n\n406\n00:19:35.355 --> 00:19:37.948\nSo we want to set this up so\nthat users can opt in, right.\n\n407\n00:19:37.948 --> 00:19:40.778\nThey can join the list, or they can\nleave it at their own advance, right,\n\n408\n00:19:40.778 --> 00:19:42.445\njust whatever they want.\n\n409\n00:19:42.445 --> 00:19:46.320\nSo I'm gonna create this,\nand I'll pop it into our OU.\n\n410\n00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.160\nI'll leave the administrator\nhere as the owner.\n\n411\n00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.180\nWe would add in whoever was in charge of\nthe leadership group, we would add them.\n\n412\n00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.855\nSo maybe it's Jane Smith, so\nI'll add her as an owner also.\n\n413\n00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:57.809\nAnd you can stay an owner as\nadministrator if you want.\n\n414\n00:19:57.809 --> 00:20:03.690\nYou don't have to, but it's kind of up\nto how you plan on administering this.\n\n415\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.920\nAnd then down here we can add\nthe group owners as members.\n\n416\n00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.760\nNow, I don't wanna be a member,\nbut we'll make Jane a member.\n\n417\n00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.888\nAnd so I'm gonna have to manually add her.\n\n418\n00:20:10.888 --> 00:20:14.140\nAnd you could add anybody else that wanted\ntoo, but I'll just add Jane for now.\n\n419\n00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.600\nOkay, so there's Jane.\n\n420\n00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.220\nAnd then down below I can pick\nhow the membership is controlled.\n\n421\n00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.010\nNow, there's three ways to do it.\n\n422\n00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.400\nOne, we can close it off.\n\n423\n00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.464\nAll right, if you close it off,\nJane would have to manually go and\n\n424\n00:20:25.464 --> 00:20:27.210\nadd people to the group or remove it.\n\n425\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:27.710\nShe's an owner.\n\n426\n00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.210\nShe can do it, all right?\n\n427\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.200\nBut she'd have to do it manually.\n\n428\n00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.696\nBut if we choose one of the other two,\nopen and closed.\n\n429\n00:20:33.696 --> 00:20:35.730\nThese are a little bit different, okay?\n\n430\n00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:41.070\nWith closed, users can see the group,\nand they can request to join.\n\n431\n00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.820\nBut if they request to join, they'll\nbe rejected automatically, all right.\n\n432\n00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.492\nNow Jane'll see that rejection.\n\n433\n00:20:46.492 --> 00:20:48.607\nAnd she could go and\noverride that if you wanted, but\n\n434\n00:20:48.607 --> 00:20:50.900\nit'll just be rejected automatically.\n\n435\n00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:55.820\nBut open, anybody can see the group,\nand they can join it, right?\n\n436\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.340\nIt says here, they can join this group\nwithout being approved by the group owner.\n\n437\n00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.859\nThey don't have to get approval,\nthey can just opt-in.\n\n438\n00:21:01.859 --> 00:21:05.020\nAnd then if they want out,\nright down here, they can opt-out.\n\n439\n00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.680\nOpen means anyone can come in and\nleave when they want, all right?\n\n440\n00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.840\nClosed means they can't come and go,\nJane will have to manually add them.\n\n441\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.300\nOwner approval means they\ncan submit a request, and\n\n442\n00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.340\nJane will have to approve or\ndecline it based on her decision.\n\n443\n00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.700\nShe'll get an email with a little check or\nan x, and she'll pick and\n\n444\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.660\nchoose whether she wants to let them in.\n\n445\n00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.997\nBut if I make this one open,\nI'm just gonna make it open,\n\n446\n00:21:27.997 --> 00:21:30.345\nany employee can join\nthe leadership group if they want.\n\n447\n00:21:30.345 --> 00:21:34.705\nI'll save that, and\nnow users can opt-in on their own, okay.\n\n448\n00:21:34.705 --> 00:21:37.345\nNow this is gonna require\na little bit of user education.\n\n449\n00:21:37.345 --> 00:21:40.093\nSo now that we've got that set up,\nwe go and we tell Jane, hey Jane,\n\n450\n00:21:40.093 --> 00:21:41.815\nwe set up that mailing list you needed.\n\n451\n00:21:41.815 --> 00:21:44.965\nYou've got your leadership group,\nhere's what you need to tell people.\n\n452\n00:21:44.965 --> 00:21:47.799\nSend out an email to the users,\nor whatever, and just say,\n\n453\n00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:51.159\nhey If you'd like to be a part of my\ngroup, here's what you need to do.\n\n454\n00:21:51.159 --> 00:21:54.890\nLog into OWA, go into your settings,\nand join the group.\n\n455\n00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:55.860\nHere's the steps, right?\n\n456\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.230\nLet me show you guys how it works.\n\n457\n00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:01.782\nI'll do an incognito window or\nInPrivate browsing.\n\n458\n00:22:01.782 --> 00:22:05.747\nShows which browser I normally use,\nbut I'll [LAUGH] go ahead and\n\n459\n00:22:05.747 --> 00:22:07.817\nget logged into OWA, all right?\n\n460\n00:22:07.817 --> 00:22:09.996\nAnd when I login,\nI'm gonna login as myself.\n\n461\n00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:17.450\nSo, I'll be dpezet@itvpro.net and\nI'll sign in.\n\n462\n00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.800\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna get logged in here now.\n\n463\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.540\nJane, I made her a member of the group,\nbut nobody else was a member of the group.\n\n464\n00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.830\nIt's just Jane.\n\n465\n00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.980\nSo when I get logged in, I'm not a member.\n\n466\n00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.740\nBut I can opt-in to it.\n\n467\n00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.380\nI'll go into my settings.\n\n468\n00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.731\nI'll go into the groups area, and\n\n469\n00:22:31.731 --> 00:22:33.839\nyou'll be able to see\nthe groups that are available.\n\n470\n00:22:33.839 --> 00:22:39.737\nAnd you can pick and choose to join\nthe group, so let me just save that.\n\n471\n00:22:39.737 --> 00:22:40.358\nAnd we'll get in there.\n\n472\n00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:43.871\nNow, where it's not intuitive, the reason\nyou have to tell the end users is most end\n\n473\n00:22:43.871 --> 00:22:47.660\nusers, they're gonna see these\ngroups in their global address list.\n\n474\n00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.363\nAnd they're gonna think,\nwell how do I join it?\n\n475\n00:22:50.363 --> 00:22:51.576\nAnd they're in the global address list.\n\n476\n00:22:51.576 --> 00:22:54.741\nAnd so, it's not intuitive for them to\nthink, I've gotta go into my options, but\n\n477\n00:22:54.741 --> 00:22:55.930\nthat's exactly how it works.\n\n478\n00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:00.640\nSo, I gotta go up here to my gear, and\nin here we can go into our Options.\n\n479\n00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.330\nAnd in your Options, inside of OWA\non the left side, you've got groups.\n\n480\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.725\nAnd when you go to groups, that's what's\ngonna pull up the groups that you're\n\n481\n00:23:08.725 --> 00:23:12.330\nalready a member of as well as showing\nones that you could potentially join.\n\n482\n00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.450\nSo we'll give that\na second while it updates.\n\n483\n00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.670\nThis is the first time\nI've logged in I guess.\n\n484\n00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.437\nSee how it shows distribution\ngroups I belong to?\n\n485\n00:23:17.437 --> 00:23:19.115\nI already belong to IT, right?\n\n486\n00:23:19.115 --> 00:23:22.420\nAnd groups that I own,\nthese are ones that I'm the manager of.\n\n487\n00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.920\nAnd so if you were Jane and\nyou wanted to add or remove people,\n\n488\n00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.310\nyou'd go right in here to groups\nthat I own, and edit the group.\n\n489\n00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.510\nAnd you could then edit its membership,\nright?\n\n490\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.100\nBut if I want to join a group,\nright up here,\n\n491\n00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.665\nyou'll see the little people with a plus\nsign, and that lets us join a group.\n\n492\n00:23:37.665 --> 00:23:40.770\nOr the people with a minus\nsign lets us leave a group.\n\n493\n00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.540\nAnd if we've got it set to open,\nwe can hit the people with a plus.\n\n494\n00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.510\nWe can go to join, and\nhere's all the groups that are open.\n\n495\n00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.270\nI've got sales department, IT,\napparently I left those open.\n\n496\n00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.920\nBut I can choose Leadership Training, and\n\n497\n00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:58.730\nif it's set to truly be open,\nthen I'm gonna be able to join it.\n\n498\n00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.850\nIf it's set to owner approval,\nthis will kick off an email to Jane.\n\n499\n00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.730\nJane'll get an email, and she'll be able\nto approve or decline it, just like any\n\n500\n00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.428\nkind of calendar invite you approve or\ndecline, that's what she'll get.\n\n501\n00:24:08.428 --> 00:24:11.180\nAnd if she approves it, I'm in, and\nif she declines it, I'm not, right?\n\n502\n00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:15.240\nBut in this case I can select the group I\nwant and I can hit the join button, and\n\n503\n00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.830\nit's gonna update.\n\n504\n00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.960\nI should be joining that group.\n\n505\n00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.740\nThere we go, I've successfully joined\nthe group Leadership Training.\n\n506\n00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.799\nOr it would say, an email has been\nsent to the group administrator for\n\n507\n00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:24.712\napproval, right.\n\n508\n00:24:24.712 --> 00:24:26.940\nSo it's kind of letting me\nknow what that status is.\n\n509\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.680\nAnd when I close out, now I can see\nI'm in the Leadership Training, right.\n\n510\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.962\nI'm a member of that group,\nI opted in, and\n\n511\n00:24:32.962 --> 00:24:35.325\nI didn't have to get\nthe help desk involved.\n\n512\n00:24:35.325 --> 00:24:38.215\nAnd then if I decide I'm kinda\ndone with the leadership group.\n\n513\n00:24:38.215 --> 00:24:39.472\nI've learned all I'm gonna learn.\n\n514\n00:24:39.472 --> 00:24:42.888\nI can come right back into here,\nchoose Leadership Training, and\n\n515\n00:24:42.888 --> 00:24:44.500\nchoose to unjoin it.\n\n516\n00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.650\nAnd here it'll say it's going to unjoin\nme, and now I'm out of the group.\n\n517\n00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.720\nThe owner of the group didn't have to\ndo anything, and the IT department,\n\n518\n00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.400\nthe administrators,\ndidn't have to do anything.\n\n519\n00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.810\nThat's really the perfect\nworld right there, right?\n\n520\n00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:59.040\nSo, dynamic access groups,\nthey can query that AD and\n\n521\n00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.300\nautomatically build up the membership.\n\n522\n00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.593\nThese guys, though, self service groups,\nthe end users can control it themselves,\n\n523\n00:25:04.593 --> 00:25:05.550\nso that's pretty cool.\n\n524\n00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.930\nIt's a neat way to do it.\n\n525\n00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.130\nAll right, that's about all I've\ngot on distribution groups.\n\n526\n00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.730\nDo remember that if you want to get some\nreally complex queries written in there,\n\n527\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.800\nyou can drop to PowerShell and\nyou can write some amazing ones.\n\n528\n00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.010\nCheck out Microsoft's Technet website,\nthey've got some great examples on there.\n\n529\n00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.088\nBut the GUI part, that’s really all\nthey want you to know for the exam.\n\n530\n00:25:21.088 --> 00:25:23.740\nAnd in real life, [LAUGH] it’s\nwhat most of us are going to use,\n\n531\n00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.097\ncuz organizational units really lend\nthemselves to filtering pretty well.\n\n532\n00:25:27.097 --> 00:25:30.570\nAll right, well, in this episode, we got\na chance to see some new recipient types,\n\n533\n00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.380\nright, the distribution groups.\n\n534\n00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.170\nAnd we saw standard distribution groups,\nwhich are just used for email, and\n\n535\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.670\nwe saw the self-service\nfunctionality on those.\n\n536\n00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.813\nWe got to see security groups,\nwhich are used for email and permissions.\n\n537\n00:25:42.813 --> 00:25:45.763\nAnd then lastly we got to see\ndynamic distribution groups,\n\n538\n00:25:45.763 --> 00:25:49.800\nwhich can do an LDAP query to populate\nautomatically and stay up to date.\n\n539\n00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.180\nThree different types of groups,\n\n540\n00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.120\nthree different use case scenarios,\nall useful, right?\n\n541\n00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.790\nAnd definitely something you'll\nend up using in the real world.\n\n542\n00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.580\nSo, hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n543\n00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.680\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet,\nand I'll see you next time.\n\n544\n00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:08.228\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.018\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.018 --> 00:00:18.737\nI'm your host Don Pezet\nback again with another\n\n5\n00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:21.210\nepisode of Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.836\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at delegating permissions on\n\n7\n00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:28.253\na mailbox or as I like to call it,\npushing our work off on somebody else.\n\n8\n00:00:28.253 --> 00:00:31.501\nBecause why bother sending your own email\nwhen somebody else can do it for you?\n\n9\n00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:34.007\n[LAUGH] So\nthis is actually a pretty common setup,\n\n10\n00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:35.543\nwhere you get a lot of people.\n\n11\n00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:39.666\nPeople who are executives, like a CEO\nwhere they get a high volume of email and\n\n12\n00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:44.360\nthey can't possibly deal with all the\nemail themselves, so they have assistants.\n\n13\n00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.312\nOr it might be like a celebrity,\nwho has a celebrity mailbox and\n\n14\n00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:49.947\nthey have an agent or\na PR firm that handles the replies.\n\n15\n00:00:49.947 --> 00:00:54.511\nSo there's plenty of times where we need\nother people not necessarily to be able\n\n16\n00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:57.914\nto have full access to our mailbox,\nbut to be able to reply or\n\n17\n00:00:57.914 --> 00:01:02.360\nsend emails on our behalf and that's\na feature that's built in to Exchange.\n\n18\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.952\nAnd it's one of the more interesting ones,\nbecause there's so\n\n19\n00:01:04.952 --> 00:01:07.050\nmany different ways to configure it.\n\n20\n00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.070\nSending on behalf of somebody or\n\n21\n00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.980\ndelegating permissions to send as you,\nit's something we can set up as\n\n22\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.020\nadministrators right inside of\nthe Exchange Admin Center or\n\n23\n00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.110\nit's something the end users can set up\nthemselves without getting us involved.\n\n24\n00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.495\nSo from that perspective,\nthe setting it up in Outlook,\n\n25\n00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:23.899\nwe can just let them deal with it.\n\n26\n00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.267\nThat's not our problem.\n\n27\n00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:28.470\nBut we can set it up inside of Exchange,\nso we need to know it.\n\n28\n00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.821\nIt is on the exam and it's something\nwe just want to be aware of.\n\n29\n00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:34.180\nSo let's take a look at that and\nI'll give you guys an example.\n\n30\n00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.088\nSo here inside my Exchange environment,\nI've got a couple recipients set up and\n\n31\n00:01:38.088 --> 00:01:39.709\nI've got Bob Denver right here.\n\n32\n00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.483\nAnd so Bob, he might be really busy a nd\nhe needs somebody to be able to send email\n\n33\n00:01:43.483 --> 00:01:44.600\non his behalf.\n\n34\n00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.413\nSo maybe he has an assistant and we'll say\nthat Jane Smith here is his assistant.\n\n35\n00:01:48.413 --> 00:01:53.330\nAnd we want Jane to be able to\nsend emails on Bob's behalf.\n\n36\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.078\nSo if we go and take Bob's account here,\nwe can edit his account.\n\n37\n00:01:57.078 --> 00:01:59.244\nAnd in tthe settings for his mailbox,\n\n38\n00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:02.707\nyou'll see down here where\nwe've got mailbox delegation.\n\n39\n00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:06.520\nNow there's actually three\ndifferent ways to do delegation.\n\n40\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.300\nThe first one is Send As.\n\n41\n00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.055\nWell, Send As is kind of\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n42\n00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:15.840\nI want Jane to be able to Send As Bob and\nright beneath it, I've got Send on Behalf.\n\n43\n00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.520\nI want Jane to Send on Behalf of Bob also.\n\n44\n00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.120\nWhat's the difference?\n\n45\n00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.080\nWell, the difference is how this shows up.\n\n46\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.530\nIf I give Jane Send As permissions, she\ncan now send an email as if she were Bob.\n\n47\n00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.444\nAnd whoever receives the email\nwill have no way to know,\n\n48\n00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:33.492\nwhether it was Bob that sent it or Jane.\n\n49\n00:02:33.492 --> 00:02:36.213\nIt's very obvious that it was\njust sent by Bob and that's it.\n\n50\n00:02:36.213 --> 00:02:39.120\nThey have no idea about who else\nmight have been behind the scenes.\n\n51\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.080\nSo when we choose Send As,\nwe're obscuring who the actual sender is.\n\n52\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.302\nWhen we do Send on Behalf though,\nthey'll receive an email and\n\n53\n00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:52.844\nthe recipient who receives that\nemail will see this email comes from\n\n54\n00:02:52.844 --> 00:02:55.246\nJane Smith on behalf of Bob Denver.\n\n55\n00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:59.387\nSo it's actually indicated right there\nin the from field that it was sent by\n\n56\n00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:00.504\nsomebody else, but\n\n57\n00:03:00.504 --> 00:03:04.390\nsomebody with the authority to\nemail on that person's behalf.\n\n58\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.905\nSo the choice we're really making here is\ndo we want to be apparent that somebody's\n\n59\n00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:10.399\nimpersonating somebody?\n\n60\n00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.901\nOr do we want it to be seamless and\n\n61\n00:03:11.901 --> 00:03:14.980\ninvisible that somebody's\nimpersonating somebody?\n\n62\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.534\nSend As,\nthat's the seamless invisible one.\n\n63\n00:03:17.534 --> 00:03:19.930\nSend on Behalf, that's the visible one.\n\n64\n00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.004\nThe one you can tell what's going on.\n\n65\n00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:23.710\nThere is a third way to do it.\n\n66\n00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.647\nIf you scroll down to the very\nbottom here, you've got Full Access.\n\n67\n00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:30.735\nWe could give Jane Full Access\nto Bob's mailbox,\n\n68\n00:03:30.735 --> 00:03:34.340\nthat's a lot different\nthan the send permissions.\n\n69\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.120\nSend permissions,\nJane can send emails Bob, but\n\n70\n00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.030\nshe couldn't necessarily go in and\ndelete emails out of his mailbox.\n\n71\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.130\nShe doesn't have that, she has\nthe permission to send not to go in and\n\n72\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.210\ndelete things.\n\n73\n00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.325\nIf I give her full access though,\nshe can do whatever she wants.\n\n74\n00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:50.830\nNow sometimes we want that.\n\n75\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.950\nWe want her to be able to create\ncalendar items or approve or\n\n76\n00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.680\ndecline meeting invitations.\n\n77\n00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.580\nWe might want her to be able to\ndelete emails to clean up an inbox.\n\n78\n00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.014\nSo if it's that tight of a partnership\nbetween the people, then yeah,\n\n79\n00:04:03.014 --> 00:04:06.695\nyou'll probably do full access and\ngive them all the access that they need.\n\n80\n00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:09.870\nBut let's start here with just the Send\non Behalf of, cuz that's the one that's\n\n81\n00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.730\nthe easiest to see and\nwe'll get a chance to see how that works.\n\n82\n00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.836\nSo if I want Jane to be able to send\non Bob's behalf, I can come in and\n\n83\n00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:17.453\njust add her to the list of people.\n\n84\n00:04:17.453 --> 00:04:21.760\nSo I'm gonna hit the plus sign and\nI'll pick Jane and we'll get her added in.\n\n85\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.177\nAnd you can add more than one person,\n\n86\n00:04:23.177 --> 00:04:25.987\nyou might have a whole team of people\nthat handles this person's email.\n\n87\n00:04:25.987 --> 00:04:29.170\nYou just punch each one of them in and\nthen you'll be in business.\n\n88\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.735\nSo I'm gonna get that set and I'll save\nit right there and now, it's got it.\n\n89\n00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:36.890\nNow, what if I want Jane to be able\nto send on several people's behalf?\n\n90\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.090\nWell, I can go through and\nedit each of their mailboxes one by one or\n\n91\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.819\nwe could do it from the PowerShell.\n\n92\n00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.745\nAnd from the PowerShell,\nit's a little more convenient,\n\n93\n00:04:44.745 --> 00:04:48.194\ncuz you can do like a Get-Mailbox to\npull all the mailboxes you want and\n\n94\n00:04:48.194 --> 00:04:51.570\nthen feed that into the command\nto assign her permissions.\n\n95\n00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.601\nJust to show an example,\nif I wanna give her permissions over Bob's\n\n96\n00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:57.803\nmailbox from the PowerShell,\nthe command looks something like this.\n\n97\n00:04:57.803 --> 00:05:02.945\nI would say Set-Mailbox,\ncuz I'm changing some mailbox settings and\n\n98\n00:05:02.945 --> 00:05:06.380\nI'm changing Bob Denver's mailbox.\n\n99\n00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.423\nAnd if you're not sure if the name of\nthe mailbox, I'm using the alias here.\n\n100\n00:05:09.423 --> 00:05:12.990\nBut if you're not sure,\nyou can always experiment around I'll do\n\n101\n00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.080\na Get-Mailbox bobdenver so yeah,\nI can see that is the mailbox that I want.\n\n102\n00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.702\nAnd so I'm gonna say,\nSet-Mailbox bobdenver.\n\n103\n00:05:21.702 --> 00:05:29.100\nAnd then I'm gonna say,\nGrantSendOnBehalfTo.\n\n104\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.411\nThat's the permission that I wanna give\nand I wanna grant that to janesmith.\n\n105\n00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:36.820\nOops, if I put a space in there,\nthis will actually work.\n\n106\n00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.382\nThere we go.\n\n107\n00:05:37.382 --> 00:05:40.525\nAnd so now, I'm granting that same\npermission via the PowerShell.\n\n108\n00:05:40.525 --> 00:05:42.929\nNow, why did I show this?\n\n109\n00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:47.621\nWell, we might want to do the Get-Mailbox\ncommand to get more than one mailbox and\n\n110\n00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:52.300\npipe that into the Set-Mailbox command and\nthen that would take care of it.\n\n111\n00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.304\nSo we can do many mailboxes\nall at the same time.\n\n112\n00:05:54.304 --> 00:05:55.990\nOtherwise, this is the same as the GUI.\n\n113\n00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.664\nIt's easier than the GUI that's\nhow we normally would do it.\n\n114\n00:05:59.664 --> 00:06:02.640\nNow the other permissions\nkind of come into play too.\n\n115\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.504\nIf I wanted to give her Send As or\nif I wanted to give her full access,\n\n116\n00:06:06.504 --> 00:06:08.026\nI could just modify this.\n\n117\n00:06:08.026 --> 00:06:13.380\nFor the access rights,\nhere I'm saying, -GrantSendOnBehalfTo.\n\n118\n00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.019\nWe could also say, oh,\nguess the other ones are extended rights.\n\n119\n00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:19.580\nThe command's a little bit different.\n\n120\n00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.036\nLike if I wanted to give her Send As,\nthere's a difference.\n\n121\n00:06:25.036 --> 00:06:27.458\n[LAUGH] This is gonna get a little\nconfusing, so let me try and\n\n122\n00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:29.440\nthink of the best way to phrase this.\n\n123\n00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.500\nWhen we look at Bob's account and\nwe go under mailbox delegation,\n\n124\n00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.430\nsee how they're Send As, there's Send\non Behalf and there's Full Access.\n\n125\n00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.290\nSend on Behalf is the only one the end\nusers can configure themselves.\n\n126\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.506\nAnd so,\nit's like a very high-level permission.\n\n127\n00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:49.780\nThe end user can do it,\nthe admins can do it, it's very flexible.\n\n128\n00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.329\nAnd so when I do it in PowerShell,\nI've actually got a tag for\n\n129\n00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:55.358\nthat, -GrandSendOnBehalfTo.\n\n130\n00:06:55.358 --> 00:06:57.620\nSo nice and easy to do that one.\n\n131\n00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.350\nBut the other two, Send As, where\nyou're actually impersonating somebody.\n\n132\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.287\nOr Full Access, where you have\ntotal access to the mailbox,\n\n133\n00:07:05.287 --> 00:07:08.291\nthose are a big deal and\nend users can't do those on their own.\n\n134\n00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:10.670\nThey can't set those\npermissions on their own.\n\n135\n00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.027\nWe have to set those for them.\n\n136\n00:07:13.027 --> 00:07:17.179\nAnd so as a result, I don't have this nice\nlittle easy tag that I can use if I wanted\n\n137\n00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:20.800\nto give Jane that access, instead it\nhas to be a little bit different.\n\n138\n00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.136\nWe have to say, ExtendedRights Send-As and\n\n139\n00:07:25.136 --> 00:07:30.395\nthen we have to specify who\nthat user's is going to be.\n\n140\n00:07:30.395 --> 00:07:32.595\nThe user in this case is janesmith.\n\n141\n00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:33.290\nAnd actually, you know what?\n\n142\n00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.383\nI'm doing sent mailbox,\nlet me restart this one.\n\n143\n00:07:36.383 --> 00:07:38.947\nIt's an ExtendedRight on\nthe Active Directory object, so\n\n144\n00:07:38.947 --> 00:07:41.677\nthe command's gonna look a little\nbit different for this one.\n\n145\n00:07:41.677 --> 00:07:46.295\nIt's gonna be Add-ADPermission,\nthere we go.\n\n146\n00:07:46.295 --> 00:07:51.149\nAnd I'm gonna be adding it\nto bobdenver's account and\n\n147\n00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:56.108\nthen I'll say,\n-ExtendedRights Send-As -user and\n\n148\n00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:59.496\nthen that's where it's janesmith.\n\n149\n00:07:59.496 --> 00:08:01.063\nIt's a different command.\n\n150\n00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:02.922\nAnd so, why is it so different?\n\n151\n00:08:02.922 --> 00:08:05.590\nWell, it's because it's actually\na permission on the account.\n\n152\n00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.740\nAdministrators have to set it,\nthe end users can't do it.\n\n153\n00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.770\nSo it's not tied to the mailbox as much as\nit is tied to the active directory user\n\n154\n00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.990\naccount itself.\n\n155\n00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.420\nAnd so this would give her\nthe full send as permissions.\n\n156\n00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.660\nNow, I don't want to do that just yet.\n\n157\n00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.880\nI want to hold off, cuz I want to show you\nguys that send on behalf of first, and\n\n158\n00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.858\nthen we'll come back, and\nwe'll get a chance to see true send as.\n\n159\n00:08:22.858 --> 00:08:28.120\nAll right now I've assigned her send\non behalf and I did it via the AEC and\n\n160\n00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.260\nI did it via the PowerShell right here so\nwe've had a chance to see that.\n\n161\n00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.550\nHow's an end user do it themselves right?\n\n162\n00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.950\nIf Bob just wanted to set these\npermissions himself he could do it\n\n163\n00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.170\njust for send on behalf.\n\n164\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.250\nLet me show you that.\n\n165\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.020\nI'm gonna switch over and login as Bob.\n\n166\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.700\nSo if I jump over to Bob's account, Bob\ncan do it right from inside of the Outlook\n\n167\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.490\nclient or in Outlook Web Access,\neither one.\n\n168\n00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.310\nSo here he is inside of good old Outlook,\nand\n\n169\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.860\ninside of Outlook,\nhe can just go up here to File > Info,\n\n170\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.300\nand then under Account Settings,\nhe'll have delegate access.\n\n171\n00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.260\nHe can set a delegate.\n\n172\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.570\nThis is a person who will\nhave access to his mailbox.\n\n173\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.050\nAnd when you choose that,\nhere's where you start to add people.\n\n174\n00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.895\nAnd see how Jane Smith\nis already in the list.\n\n175\n00:09:14.895 --> 00:09:17.440\nThat's cuz I added Jane on the server.\n\n176\n00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.250\nSo you can add somebody in right here,\nand then specify what they have,\n\n177\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.560\nwhat type of access they have.\n\n178\n00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.270\nIf we choose permissions,\nhe can define what they can do.\n\n179\n00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:32.030\nAnd see how she has on the inbox,\nauthor can read and create items.\n\n180\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.080\nSo she can read his mailbox,\nbut she can't delete emails.\n\n181\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.380\nAnd she can create items.\n\n182\n00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.360\nShe can send new emails.\n\n183\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.810\nBut she can't delete existing ones.\n\n184\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.710\nSo that's the permission that we're\ndoing when we do send on behalf of.\n\n185\n00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.870\nAnd he can always manipulate this\nto give other permissions, too, but\n\n186\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.380\nthese are the base ones that we need for\nher to be able to send those emails.\n\n187\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.570\nSo I'm just gonna leave\nthat be like it is, and\n\n188\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.150\nnow, he can send emails, or\nsomebody else can send them on his behalf.\n\n189\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.230\nJane.\n\n190\n00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.450\nSo let me jump over to Jane's account and\n\n191\n00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.680\nI'll show you what it\nlooks like on her end.\n\n192\n00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.490\nAnd then we'll see what it looks\nlike to be the recipient of it.\n\n193\n00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:10.520\nSo I'm going to switch over to Jane, and\n\n194\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.180\nif I log in as Jane,\nnow when Jane logs in,\n\n195\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.730\nshe's going to log into her own\nmailbox and she's gonna see her email.\n\n196\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.730\nAnd so if she starts drafting email, it's\njust gonna be her stuff and that's it.\n\n197\n00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.790\nNothing too terribly exciting there.\n\n198\n00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:29.000\nBut, because she's a delegate on Bob's\nmailbox, she can open Bob's mailbox now.\n\n199\n00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.460\nRemember we saw the permissions executor.\n\n200\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.670\nShe has read permissions on that mailbox.\n\n201\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.920\nSo if she were to go up here\nto File > Open & Export and\n\n202\n00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.550\nthen choose Other User's Folder, she could\ncome in here and punch in Bob Denver,\n\n203\n00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.540\nor pick him out of the name list.\n\n204\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.570\nAnd when she opens his mailbox,\nshe'll see his email.\n\n205\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.110\nSee?\nHere,\n\n206\n00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.550\nshe's seeing that kickoff meeting\nthat came from Don Pezet and\n\n207\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.590\nwent to Bob Denver.\n\n208\n00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.510\nJane is not a recipient on this list.\n\n209\n00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.110\nShe's looking at Bob's mailbox.\n\n210\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.716\nBut she's still logged in as herself,\nwe can see it over here.\n\n211\n00:10:57.716 --> 00:11:00.374\nSee how it says janesmith@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n212\n00:11:00.374 --> 00:11:02.620\nShe's still logged in as herself.\n\n213\n00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.760\nBut it's kind of neat, because whenever\nshe writes an email, see how the email.\n\n214\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.410\nNo actually I'm displaying the From field.\n\n215\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.120\nLet me show you what it\nlooks like by default.\n\n216\n00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.580\nThis is what it looks like by\ndefault when she fires off an email.\n\n217\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.660\nShe fires it up.\n\n218\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.840\nAnd you have a To: and a CC field.\n\n219\n00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.672\nTo, that's who you're emailing to.\n\n220\n00:11:18.672 --> 00:11:21.365\nAnd then CC is other people\nyou want to copy in on it.\n\n221\n00:11:21.365 --> 00:11:23.370\nWell maybe she wants to\nsend an email to me.\n\n222\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.220\nSo she's going to email Don Pezet.\n\n223\n00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.190\nAnd this would be some kind of status\nupdate, telling me to get to work.\n\n224\n00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.020\nBut Jane's not my boss.\n\n225\n00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.630\nShe can't tell me what to do.\n\n226\n00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.230\nBob Denver is my boss.\n\n227\n00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.590\nWell, she is a duly appointed\nrepresentative of Bob Denver.\n\n228\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.450\nSo she can say you know what.\n\n229\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.420\nI'm gonna send this on behalf of Bob.\n\n230\n00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.206\nSo it's not Jane saying it.\n\n231\n00:11:44.206 --> 00:11:45.310\nIt's Bob saying it.\n\n232\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.530\nJane just happens to be\nthe person who wrote the email.\n\n233\n00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.770\nSo to do that,\nshe can o up here to Options, and\n\n234\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.060\nhit From to display the From field.\n\n235\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.990\nIf you're in Outlook Web Access\nit's a little bit different.\n\n236\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.660\nYou hit the ellipsis button,\nthe little three dots up at the top, and\n\n237\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.620\nyou'll have the ability to\ndisplay From there too.\n\n238\n00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.690\nBut once you've got\nthe From field displayed,\n\n239\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.580\nsee how she can drop that down and\nBob Denver's right there on the list.\n\n240\n00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.580\nHe's in the list because she's\nbeen delegated that access, so\n\n241\n00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:13.950\nshe can choose to send as Bob Denver\nto me and she can fire that email off.\n\n242\n00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:14.580\nOkay.\n\n243\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.860\nNow, if the permissions are set correctly,\nthat email will go to my mailbox, and\n\n244\n00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.400\nI'll have an email from Bob but\nactually from Jane on Bob's behalf.\n\n245\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.340\nIf the permissions are set incorrectly,\n\n246\n00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.570\nshe'll get a bounceback\nmessage right here.\n\n247\n00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.320\nAnybody can attempt to send\nan email as somebody else.\n\n248\n00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.630\nThey just might not have the permission.\n\n249\n00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.870\nIf she tries to craft a new email, and\n\n250\n00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.170\ngoes up here to the from field,\nand enters in say,\n\n251\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:41.860\nmy address right, so she's going to try to\nsend an email as me, it'll let her try.\n\n252\n00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:49.213\nSo we'll send an email maybe\nto BobDenver@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n253\n00:12:49.213 --> 00:12:52.680\nAnd we'll just say, Don is a loser.\n\n254\n00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.670\nMy mistake, all right, so we're going to,\n\n255\n00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:00.930\nkind of, send a scathing email as\nDon Pezet, and we'll send that.\n\n256\n00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.830\nShe doesn't have send of behalf\nof permissions for my mailbox, so\n\n257\n00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.330\nwhen she goes to send that,\nit's going to bounce.\n\n258\n00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.794\nNow notice I'm not seeing\nthat bounce message,\n\n259\n00:13:08.794 --> 00:13:11.691\nthat's because I'm actually\nviewing Bob's mailbox.\n\n260\n00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:15.209\nSo she needs to switch back to her own\nmailbox and back in her own mailbox,\n\n261\n00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:17.748\nhere's a system administrator\nundeliverable, so\n\n262\n00:13:17.748 --> 00:13:19.090\nshe got that Don is a loser.\n\n263\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:19.900\nThat one didn't go.\n\n264\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.080\nGot blocked.\n\n265\n00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.350\nBut the other email that she sent as Bob,\nit's gone.\n\n266\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.490\nThat's because it was allowed,\nor at least it should have been.\n\n267\n00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.070\nWe'll find out.\n\n268\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.500\nIf I switch back to my account.\n\n269\n00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.630\nSo I'll jump back over to me.\n\n270\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.690\nI should have an email that was\nsent from her on Bob's behalf.\n\n271\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:42.204\nSo let's jump back over here,\nand I'll get into my email.\n\n272\n00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:43.090\nI'll just use OWA.\n\n273\n00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:48.780\nNow when I get logged in, what I expect to\nsee is an email from Jane on Bob's behalf,\n\n274\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.850\nit should be in my inbox\nif I can ever get into it.\n\n275\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.540\nMaybe it would be faster to go Outlook,\nthere we go.\n\n276\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.970\nSo here's this email from Bob Denver.\n\n277\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.270\nSee how it says it's from Bob Denver,\nStatus Update, Get to work.\n\n278\n00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:04.010\nBut over here in the message\ndetails see how it says Jane Smith\n\n279\n00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.880\non behalf of Bob Denver.\n\n280\n00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.580\nSo now I know, the email came from Bob but\nhe didn't actually write it.\n\n281\n00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.610\nJane wrote it.\n\n282\n00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.500\nJane wrote it on his behalf.\n\n283\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.160\nSo maybe Bob told her to write that.\n\n284\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.290\nOr maybe she's just acting\nunder Bob's authority.\n\n285\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.920\nEither way, that's how it worked.\n\n286\n00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.465\nAnd I can see that it happened.\n\n287\n00:14:19.465 --> 00:14:24.560\nNow, we can change that to give\nher send as permissions, and\n\n288\n00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.800\nnow it's gonna be different.\n\n289\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.730\nAnd that's what I was kinda showing\nyou here in the PowerShell was,\n\n290\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.050\nif I give her send as permissions\n\n291\n00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:37.430\nnow she can actually act as that person\nand I won't even know that it happened.\n\n292\n00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.960\nSo we can do that, we can jump into our\nExchange settings, we can edit Bob and\n\n293\n00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.560\nwe can go in here and\ntake her out of the send on behalf, and\n\n294\n00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.250\nadd her in to the send as.\n\n295\n00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.756\nYou don't want somebody to be in both,\ncuz it kind of creates a conflict.\n\n296\n00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:54.300\nIt will actually let you do it,\nbut it does create a conflict.\n\n297\n00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.580\nSo you usually want somebody to either\nhave send as or send on behalf of,\n\n298\n00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.080\nnot both.\n\n299\n00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.270\nBut now,\nwhen she has that send as permission,\n\n300\n00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.940\nit's not on behalf of Bob anymore.\n\n301\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.560\nIt's actually as Bob.\n\n302\n00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.930\nAnd so when people receive those emails,\nthey won't see that it's from Jane Smith.\n\n303\n00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.360\nThey'll just see that it's from Bob.\n\n304\n00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.590\nNow, making changes like this\ncan take time to kick in.\n\n305\n00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:20.210\nSo I just made the change, but it could be\nan hour before it actually takes effect,\n\n306\n00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.960\nso don't expect this one to happen\nimmediately when you make the change.\n\n307\n00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.940\nAnd that's because the permissions\nhave to propagate out and\n\n308\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.460\nOutlook caches a lot\nof this stuff offline.\n\n309\n00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.350\nSo it's actually kind of\ncached her permissions.\n\n310\n00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.470\nAnd so it can take a little while for\nOutlook to recognize that.\n\n311\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:37.020\nNow the other permission that was in\nthere was the full mailbox access.\n\n312\n00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.970\nThe send as ones,\nthose she can send email as the person,\n\n313\n00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.670\nshe can read the email cuz\nyou might want to reply.\n\n314\n00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.950\nBut she can't delete anything.\n\n315\n00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.485\nIf we do the send, I mean,\ndo the full access,\n\n316\n00:15:47.485 --> 00:15:49.435\nthen she can do whatever she wants.\n\n317\n00:15:49.435 --> 00:15:51.593\nShe can delete emails and\ngo crazy with it.\n\n318\n00:15:51.593 --> 00:15:54.253\nSo we do have to be careful with that one.\n\n319\n00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:58.838\nIf we want to give somebody Full\naccess via the GUI is the easiest.\n\n320\n00:15:58.838 --> 00:16:01.647\nYou can do it from the PowerShell too,\nthough.\n\n321\n00:16:01.647 --> 00:16:07.032\nAnd from the PowerShell the command\nis a little bit different.\n\n322\n00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:08.350\nWhat did I do here?\n\n323\n00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.130\nI left that command up from before.\n\n324\n00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.782\nSo [COUGH] if we wanna set it from\nhere in the command line, we can say,\n\n325\n00:16:13.782 --> 00:16:18.680\nAdd-MailboxPermission -Identity.\n\n326\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.350\nAnd we can specify who we're assigning\npermissions to, so I might say bobdenver.\n\n327\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.430\nI want to assign permissions.\n\n328\n00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.025\nAnd then I want to assign\npermissions to janesmith.\n\n329\n00:16:29.025 --> 00:16:31.645\nThat's the person I'm\ngiving permissions to, and\n\n330\n00:16:31.645 --> 00:16:39.425\nI wanna give her -AccessRights FullAccess.\n\n331\n00:16:39.425 --> 00:16:42.065\nAnd then we can say, and\nthis is kind of an important part.\n\n332\n00:16:42.065 --> 00:16:45.285\nBy default it applies to\nthe root of the mailbox and\n\n333\n00:16:45.285 --> 00:16:47.015\nnot necessarily the subfolders.\n\n334\n00:16:47.015 --> 00:16:47.935\nAnd so I need to come in and\n\n335\n00:16:47.935 --> 00:16:53.056\nsay -InheritanceType All, to make sure\nthat it trickles down to cover everything,\n\n336\n00:16:53.056 --> 00:16:56.810\ncalendars, tasks, all the other\ndifferent items that make up Outlook.\n\n337\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:57.950\nI want to make sure I cover all of that.\n\n338\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.500\nAnd when we set this, now she'll\nhave full access to the mailbox.\n\n339\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.030\nShe can send emails, she can delete items,\nshe can manipulate things, and\n\n340\n00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.250\nhave that full access to\nthe system that she needs.\n\n341\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.670\nSo just depends on whether or\nnot that's what we're trying to go for.\n\n342\n00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:15.110\nIt's another one where it's certainly\neasier to do via the GUI, but\n\n343\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.810\nif you're just trying to grant somebody\nfull access to all the mailbox,\n\n344\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:18.920\nmaybe it's an attorney and\n\n345\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.850\nthey need to do some kind of e-discovery,\nwe can do it here using a bulk command.\n\n346\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.520\nThere's other ways to do e-discovery too.\n\n347\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.470\nYou don't have to do it this way.\n\n348\n00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.040\nAll right, so\nonce those permissions are assigned,\n\n349\n00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.600\nnow Jane can start to do anything.\n\n350\n00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.210\nAnd I guess we can test it out and\nsee if it takes effect fast enough.\n\n351\n00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.630\nLet me switch over to Jane.\n\n352\n00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.720\nIt does take a while, so\n\n353\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.150\nI won't be surprised if this\none doesn't work right now, but\n\n354\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.340\nwe'll give it a shot here.\n\n355\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.341\nSo I'm gonna pull up Jane.\n\n356\n00:17:45.341 --> 00:17:48.309\nAnd the first thing I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna close Outlook and\n\n357\n00:17:48.309 --> 00:17:52.005\ncome back into it, because Outlook does\ncache a lot of this stuff offline, and\n\n358\n00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:54.140\nI want to make sure that it is clean.\n\n359\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.141\nSo I'm just going to close Outlook and\nmake sure that it actually closes,\n\n360\n00:17:58.141 --> 00:17:58.923\nwhich it did.\n\n361\n00:17:58.923 --> 00:18:00.245\nAnd then we'll fire it back up again.\n\n362\n00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:05.156\nAll right, so when Outlook fires up it's\nsupposed to reach out to the server and\n\n363\n00:18:05.156 --> 00:18:06.390\nget the new permissions.\n\n364\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.100\nThe server might not have updated\nthings yet, but it should've happened.\n\n365\n00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.870\nAnd once that does occur,\nnow she can come in here and\n\n366\n00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.410\nstart to craft email as other people.\n\n367\n00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:20.500\nSo she can craft an email as Bob Denver,\nand then she can send an email to me.\n\n368\n00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:25.342\nAnd for the subject line we'll we'll\n\n369\n00:18:25.342 --> 00:18:30.036\njust say this is a test using send as.\n\n370\n00:18:30.036 --> 00:18:31.855\nAll right, and so\nshe's going to send it along.\n\n371\n00:18:31.855 --> 00:18:36.640\nNow to her, she doesn't see the difference\nbetween send as and send on behalf.\n\n372\n00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.770\nIt doesn't tell her that.\n\n373\n00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.000\nIt's up to what we've set to dictate that.\n\n374\n00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.540\nAnd we'll send that along and off it goes.\n\n375\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:48.110\nIt's gonna think about it, so [LAUGH]\nit's gonna send that email any time now.\n\n376\n00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.500\nOh, you know what, I rushed through\nOutlook, it hadn't fully connected to\n\n377\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.070\nthe server yet, so there might be\na certificate warning somewhere.\n\n378\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.780\nDoesn't look like it.\n\n379\n00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.980\nAll right, so I just have to be patient.\n\n380\n00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.310\nBut that one we'll send along and\n\n381\n00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.500\nthe big difference is when I receive it\nI won't see that on behalf of anymore.\n\n382\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.385\nI'll just see that it's\nactually from Bob Denver.\n\n383\n00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.330\nAll right, so\nas far as mailbox delegation is concerned,\n\n384\n00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.523\nthose are a couple of different ways\nthat we can go about doing that.\n\n385\n00:19:10.523 --> 00:19:13.400\nYeah, apparently it is just\ngonna sit there and stall on me.\n\n386\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.970\nSo let me switch back to my account.\n\n387\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.820\nBut those are kind of the key things.\n\n388\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.295\nJust remember the difference\nbetween the three.\n\n389\n00:19:18.295 --> 00:19:19.865\nOn the exam it can be really confusing and\n\n390\n00:19:19.865 --> 00:19:22.955\nin real life it can be confusing\nbecause all three are very similar.\n\n391\n00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:26.565\nAll right, well let's go ahead and\nwrap this one up here.\n\n392\n00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:30.005\nSo in this episode we got a chance to\nsee sending the delegations out or\n\n393\n00:19:30.005 --> 00:19:32.075\nsetting delegations for our users.\n\n394\n00:19:32.075 --> 00:19:34.155\nRemember the difference between the three.\n\n395\n00:19:34.155 --> 00:19:37.145\nSend As,\nyou're truly impersonating the user and\n\n396\n00:19:37.145 --> 00:19:40.865\nwhoever receives the email won't know\nwhether it came from that user or you.\n\n397\n00:19:40.865 --> 00:19:43.580\nSend on Behalf,\nyou're impersonating the user but\n\n398\n00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.790\nit shows that you're doing that, so\nwhoever receives the email will know\n\n399\n00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.460\nthat it was sent actually\nwritten by somebody else.\n\n400\n00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.520\nAnd then Full Access, that gives you\ntotal access to the mailbox to be\n\n401\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.250\nable to do whatever you want,\nincluding sending as and\n\n402\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.860\nthat would be the highest level of trust\nthat we'd give somebody on a mailbox.\n\n403\n00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.640\nIt's effectively creating\na shared mailbox at that point.\n\n404\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.120\nAll right, well, that's about all I've\ngot on delegating mailbox permissions.\n\n405\n00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.800\nI hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n406\n00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.400\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n407\n00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:17.330\n[SOUND]\n\n",

good evening.\n\n4\n00:00:13.187 --> 00:00:15.788\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:17.316\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n6\n00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:21.209\nback again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n7\n00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:25.174\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at the email policies that\n\n8\n00:00:25.174 --> 00:00:27.001\nare defined inside of Exchange.\n\n9\n00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.475\nAnd when I say email policies,\n\n10\n00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:31.263\nthere's actually several\ndifferent kinds of policies.\n\n11\n00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:34.494\nSo, the one that I'm talking\nabout today is what's really,\n\n12\n00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:37.242\nwhat used to be called\nthe Recipient Update Policy.\n\n13\n00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:41.217\nWhenever you create a mailbox inside\nof Exchange, it gets an email address,\n\n14\n00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:43.130\nit's a default email address.\n\n15\n00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.219\nAnd if you've ever wondered how does\nExchange pick what your default email\n\n16\n00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.632\naddress is, well,\nthere's a policy that defines that.\n\n17\n00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:49.404\nAnd we can go and\n\n18\n00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:53.277\nmanipulate that policy to change what\nour default email addresses end up as.\n\n19\n00:00:53.277 --> 00:00:55.247\nSo, that's a pretty neat\nthing to be able to do,\n\n20\n00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:57.630\nand it's actually not very hard at all.\n\n21\n00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.983\nThere's other things we can do with it,\ntoo.\n\n22\n00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:04.040\nFor example, you might want your users to\nget more than one email address, right?\n\n23\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.948\nAnd so, we can define that in our\npolicy to say when we create new users,\n\n24\n00:01:06.948 --> 00:01:09.241\ngive them these five different\naddresses or whatever.\n\n25\n00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:11.144\nAnd in that way,\nit's able to cover all that and\n\n26\n00:01:11.144 --> 00:01:14.012\nprovide it without somebody going\nin manually entering in addresses.\n\n27\n00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:14.813\nIt's pretty neat stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:18.530\nAnd it's something that we need\nto do on Exchange servers.\n\n29\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.993\nUsually early on in the set up,\n\n30\n00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:22.651\nyou might make changes too\nlater on down the road, too.\n\n31\n00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:24.390\nAll right.\nWell, lets take a look at this, and\n\n32\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.190\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n33\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.752\nI'm in an Exchange system here and\nI got my recipient list.\n\n34\n00:01:28.752 --> 00:01:32.676\nAnd if I were to create a new mailbox,\nright, I'm just going to come in here and\n\n35\n00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:36.854\nwhip up a new mailbox real quick, maybe\nwe'll create one for, oh, I don't know.\n\n36\n00:01:36.854 --> 00:01:37.934\nWho do I want to give a mailbox to?\n\n37\n00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.292\nWe'll give one to,\nwe'll do John Travolta, all right.\n\n38\n00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:41.495\nHe needs a mailbox.\n\n39\n00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:43.392\nSo, I'm gonna create one.\n\n40\n00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:45.088\nIt's sad these are the people\nthat popped into my mind.\n\n41\n00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:47.404\n[LAUGH] So we'll create one for\nold John Travolta,\n\n42\n00:01:47.404 --> 00:01:50.450\nwho it occurs to me I don't really\nknow how to spell his last name.\n\n43\n00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.646\nSo, we'll just figure that out there.\n\n44\n00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:53.527\nSo I'm going to and create this.\n\n45\n00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:55.864\nAnd if someone asks me for\na user login name,\n\n46\n00:01:55.864 --> 00:01:59.420\nthe user login name looks\nlike an email address, right?\n\n47\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.510\nBut, it's not their actual email address.\n\n48\n00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.518\nSo, when you punch something in here,\nlike I might punch in John,\n\n49\n00:02:04.518 --> 00:02:06.364\nI want him to be john@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n50\n00:02:06.364 --> 00:02:07.083\nOkay?\n\n51\n00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:10.425\nIs that the email address\nhe's going to end up with?\n\n52\n00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:10.938\nIt doesn't know.\n\n53\n00:02:10.938 --> 00:02:12.319\nIt doesn't know from here.\n\n54\n00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.999\nIt looks at a policy to find out what\nthe address is actually going to be.\n\n55\n00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:20.526\nAnd so, I can assign him a password,\nand it's gonna create that account and\n\n56\n00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:25.078\nwe'll see what that email address actually\nends up as here in just a moment.\n\n57\n00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.307\nSo it's gonna go and look for that policy.\n\n58\n00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:28.583\nIt's gonna create the email address.\n\n59\n00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:30.265\nIt's gonna attach it to the user.\n\n60\n00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:32.130\nAll done in the background.\n\n61\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.561\nAnd I can see over here his email\naddress is johntravolta@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n62\n00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:36.513\nAll right?\n\n63\n00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:38.022\nWell, that's not what I typed.\n\n64\n00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:40.112\nThat's not what I typed for\nthe login name.\n\n65\n00:02:40.112 --> 00:02:42.621\nRight?\nEmail address is different.\n\n66\n00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:45.029\nAll right.\nNow, if I edit John, I can go in, and\n\n67\n00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:47.095\nI can find his email addresses.\n\n68\n00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:48.416\nRight?\nSo right here under the mailbox,\n\n69\n00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:49.277\nI can go to email addresses.\n\n70\n00:02:49.277 --> 00:02:51.298\nThere it is, and I can change it.\n\n71\n00:02:51.298 --> 00:02:53.600\nWell, can I change it?\n\n72\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.040\nIf I take this email address right\nhere and I go to edit it, right?\n\n73\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.817\nHere it is.\nI can go in.\n\n74\n00:02:57.817 --> 00:02:59.339\nI can start to modify, and\nI'm going to change it.\n\n75\n00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.880\nI want him to be john@lab.itpro.tv,\nand I set it.\n\n76\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.552\nOkay.\n\n77\n00:03:03.552 --> 00:03:07.535\nIt's going to try and\nset that, and it fails.\n\n78\n00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:09.235\nNow, why did it fail?\n\n79\n00:03:09.235 --> 00:03:12.466\nIt failed because that email\naddress was set by a policy,\n\n80\n00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:15.034\nand the policy is\noverriding what I typed in.\n\n81\n00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:16.252\nIt's not letting me change it.\n\n82\n00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:17.145\nAll right?\n\n83\n00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:19.130\nSo if I say okay to that and\nI go and edit the user and\n\n84\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.007\ngo back into his email addresses,-\nit's back to the way that it was.\n\n85\n00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:22.890\nIt didn't change.\n\n86\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.574\nRight?\n\n87\n00:03:23.574 --> 00:03:27.069\nInstead, it added a second address.\n\n88\n00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.447\nYou can add to the policy, but\nyou can't override the policy by default.\n\n89\n00:03:31.447 --> 00:03:35.130\nIf you want to override it,\nyou've got to undo this check mark here.\n\n90\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.890\nIf I undo this check mark,\n\n91\n00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.180\nnow I can modify his addresses\nbecause the policy doesn't apply.\n\n92\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.650\nOn a positive side,\nthat gives me some control.\n\n93\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.621\nOn a negative side, what if I want to\nmake a bulk change down the road, right?\n\n94\n00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:47.909\nMaybe I add some new domain.\n\n95\n00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:54.300\nI add ITprotv.net, so I want everybody\nto have an ITproTV.net address.\n\n96\n00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.660\nWell, if I modify my policy, any user the\npolicy applies will get that new address,\n\n97\n00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.110\nexcept for\njohn because I disabled the policy.\n\n98\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.523\nSo it's not necessarily not the greatest\nthing to go in and disable that policy.\n\n99\n00:04:05.523 --> 00:04:08.661\nInstead, if we wanna change\nthe way users addresses work,\n\n100\n00:04:08.661 --> 00:04:11.240\nwe should go and modify the policy itself.\n\n101\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.579\nSo, let's take a look at that.\n\n102\n00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.273\nSo the email address policy is\nactually defined right back here.\n\n103\n00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:18.450\nIf I go into my Exchange admin center,\non my left side,\n\n104\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.740\nyou will see all the different things.\n\n105\n00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.562\nAnd what we're looking for\nis a section on mail flow.\n\n106\n00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:25.292\nIt's not the most intuitive, I guess.\n\n107\n00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:26.692\nBut if you think about mail flow,\n\n108\n00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:29.692\nthis is dictating how email moves\nthrough our Exchange organization.\n\n109\n00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:35.032\nAnd inside of mail flow, you'll find\nyour email address policies, all right.\n\n110\n00:04:35.032 --> 00:04:38.562\nThe email address policies, those\nare what dictates what addresses we get,\n\n111\n00:04:38.562 --> 00:04:41.452\nhow our users are getting an email\naddress generated for them.\n\n112\n00:04:41.452 --> 00:04:45.204\nAnd if you take it, you'll have at least\none, right, you have to have one, and\n\n113\n00:04:45.204 --> 00:04:46.617\nthat's the default policy.\n\n114\n00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:48.727\nNow you can have more than one policy, and\n\n115\n00:04:48.727 --> 00:04:53.200\nthat's pretty neat because you might have\ndifferent employees with different needs.\n\n116\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.417\nMaybe you have multiple\ncompanies under one umbrella.\n\n117\n00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:59.052\nAnd so, you want people in\nCompany A to get one email address and\n\n118\n00:04:59.052 --> 00:05:01.316\npeople in Company B to get\na different email address.\n\n119\n00:05:01.316 --> 00:05:03.300\nYou can define policies that do that.\n\n120\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.408\nSo, they have a priority, and\nthey're applied in order.\n\n121\n00:05:06.408 --> 00:05:09.366\nOnly one policy applies to a user,\nso, the first one that matches for\n\n122\n00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:12.747\nthem is what applies, and so the order\nthese are in is kind of important for us.\n\n123\n00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:13.570\nAll right.\n\n124\n00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.382\nI'm gonna take this default policy and\nI'm gonna edit it.\n\n125\n00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:17.637\nAnd when you going into\nthe settings of the policy,\n\n126\n00:05:17.637 --> 00:05:19.584\nthere's not a whole heck\nof a lot to change.\n\n127\n00:05:19.584 --> 00:05:23.045\nRight here we've got the name,\nwhich you can change on other policies,\n\n128\n00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:24.020\nnot on the default.\n\n129\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.680\nAnd then,\nwe've got our email address format.\n\n130\n00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.935\nThis is the important one.\n\n131\n00:05:28.935 --> 00:05:34.379\nSee how it's got an email address format\ndefined as something @lab.itpro.tv?\n\n132\n00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.480\nThere's that domain that they're\ngetting that address for.\n\n133\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.040\nAnd if I edit that,\nI can go in and I can change it.\n\n134\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.887\nAnd if you look at it, you'll see here\nthis accepted domain is lab.itpro.tv, and\n\n135\n00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:50.478\nthen how it's generating the email\naddress, alias@contoso.com, right?\n\n136\n00:05:50.478 --> 00:05:52.858\nAnd then,\nyou'll see these other examples down here.\n\n137\n00:05:52.858 --> 00:05:58.593\nJohn.Smith, JSmith, JohnS, Smith.John, all\nthese other formats that I can pick from.\n\n138\n00:05:58.593 --> 00:06:03.039\nOr ,we can do a complete custom address\nand enter in a different format here.\n\n139\n00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.685\nAnd it's got this Learn More link which is\nkind of important because if you're gong\n\n140\n00:06:06.685 --> 00:06:09.356\nto build your own address,\nyou have to use their variables.\n\n141\n00:06:09.356 --> 00:06:12.597\nAnd so, here's the variables\nthat they've got, like %G for\n\n142\n00:06:12.597 --> 00:06:15.056\nthe first name, %S for\nthe last name and so on.\n\n143\n00:06:15.056 --> 00:06:19.733\nAnd you can use these to build your own\ncustom format if you want, all right.\n\n144\n00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:24.270\nNow, you've probably noticed one problem\nthat I'm gonna bump into which is all\n\n145\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.617\nof these options are grayed out, right.\n\n146\n00:06:26.617 --> 00:06:28.054\nIt's not letting me change these and\n\n147\n00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.612\nthat's because it's already\nflagged as a custom address type.\n\n148\n00:06:30.612 --> 00:06:33.839\nAnd if we uncheck that, they light up,\nand now we can start to manipulate that.\n\n149\n00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.040\nWe can change it and set it to what\nit is that we want, all right.\n\n150\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.201\nSo if I want by default,\npeople to have first name @ lab.itpro.tv,\n\n151\n00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.443\nI could come in here and\nI could choose that.\n\n152\n00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:49.445\nNow, it's not one of the default options,\nand it's not a default option because\n\n153\n00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:53.130\nwell, you're probably gonna have\ntwo employees named John, right?\n\n154\n00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.469\nSo now you've got a conflict,\nand you'll have John.\n\n155\n00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:58.810\nBut then, the second one will be\njohn1@lab.itpro.tv or john2, or\n\n156\n00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.906\nwhatever, and that's not very intuitive.\n\n157\n00:07:00.906 --> 00:07:02.509\nSo, they don't want you to deal with that.\n\n158\n00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.562\nSo, they picked something that's\na little bit more specific.\n\n159\n00:07:05.562 --> 00:07:09.425\nSo if we pick something like this\none here, john.smith@contoso.com,\n\n160\n00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:12.306\nnow, somebody would have to\nhave the same first name and\n\n161\n00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:14.292\nlast name to get a duplicate address.\n\n162\n00:07:14.292 --> 00:07:18.140\nBut maybe you don't like that dot,\nmaybe you just want it to be written out.\n\n163\n00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.044\nAnd if you look,\n\n164\n00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:23.317\nI don't have one in here that's John Smith\nwritten out without a dot, right?\n\n165\n00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:25.441\nThere's dot on that one,\nthere's a dot on that one.\n\n166\n00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:29.538\nAnd so for that, I might have to\ncreate a custom address, right?\n\n167\n00:07:29.538 --> 00:07:33.421\nAnd so, I can come in and I can specify\nthat custom address right in here in my\n\n168\n00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:36.274\nemail parameters and\ndictate how that's going to be.\n\n169\n00:07:36.274 --> 00:07:40.817\nSo if I wanted to be first name\nfollowed by last name without\n\n170\n00:07:40.817 --> 00:07:44.539\na period in between it,\nI could hit Learn More.\n\n171\n00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:50.989\nI can find the variables for that, so %G\nand %S, those are my first and last names.\n\n172\n00:07:50.989 --> 00:07:57.187\nAnd then, I can go back here and\nI can just modify this line to say, %G %S.\n\n173\n00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:59.126\n@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n174\n00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:04.400\nNow, when I create a user account, they'll\nget first name and last name at whatever.\n\n175\n00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.590\nBut you don't have to create your own,\nyou could just stick with one of these.\n\n176\n00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.300\nSo if I wanna do it with a dot,\nI could go with that.\n\n177\n00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.900\ni think the default is to use the alias\nand I typed John Travolta for\n\n178\n00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.950\nthe alias, so\nI wouldn't necessarily see that work.\n\n179\n00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.054\nLet's go first initial last name.\n\n180\n00:08:19.054 --> 00:08:22.572\nSo we'll say like JSmith@contoso.com.\n\n181\n00:08:22.572 --> 00:08:26.511\nAll right I'll go ahead and save that so\nthere's my new policy right there\n\n182\n00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:30.910\nshowing me that example of what it's gonna\ngenerate and I can go ahead and save it.\n\n183\n00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.410\nNow you do have this\napplied to field also and\n\n184\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.210\nthis determines who\nit's going to apply to.\n\n185\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.240\nOn the default policy we can't\nchange that on our own policies,\n\n186\n00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.460\nyou can say this only applies to\npeople with mailboxes, not contacts,\n\n187\n00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.260\nor this only applies to groups,\nnot mailboxes, or any mixture of them.\n\n188\n00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.660\nYou can pick and choose.\n\n189\n00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.060\nSo I'll go ahead and save that.\n\n190\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.760\nNotice how it says here if we save it,\n\n191\n00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.640\nit's not applied until\nwe actually apply it.\n\n192\n00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.100\nSo it doesn't take effect right away.\n\n193\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.880\nIf we say, okay to that,\nnow I've got the policy, and\n\n194\n00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.880\nI have to hit Apply over here for\nit to take effect.\n\n195\n00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.770\nNow we do have to be careful with this.\n\n196\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.480\nI've got a bunch of user accounts, and\n\n197\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.540\nthe user accounts already\nhave email addresses.\n\n198\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.480\nSo if I go up to recipients,\nand let's take like my account.\n\n199\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.490\nI've got donpezet@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n200\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:23.273\nWhen this policy applies,\nI should get dpezet@lab.itpro.tv,\n\n201\n00:09:23.273 --> 00:09:27.800\nbut what happens to my e-mails that\nare being sent to my old address?\n\n202\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.470\nI don't want those to bounce do I?\n\n203\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.720\nWell watch what happens.\n\n204\n00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.702\nWe'll go here into mail flow and\nour email address policy.\n\n205\n00:09:33.702 --> 00:09:35.970\nI'm gonna take this policy we\njust modified and I'll apply it.\n\n206\n00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.270\nSo, I'll go ahead and say yes to that.\n\n207\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.340\nIt's gonna reach out and it's applying it.\n\n208\n00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.300\nNow, the bigger your organization is the\nlonger it will take because it's got to\n\n209\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.630\nscrape across all the user accounts,\nall the mailboxes and apply.\n\n210\n00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:51.340\nBut, I can see that's applied now,\nand if I go back to my recipients and\n\n211\n00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.460\nI take a look, I'm just gonna hit refresh\nand make sure I've got the latest data.\n\n212\n00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.720\nDon Pezet,\nI now show as DPezet@lab.itpro.tv,\n\n213\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.390\nI got that address in\nthe format that I wanted.\n\n214\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.910\nAnd if I edit that,\nI can take a look in here and\n\n215\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.230\nsee my email addresses and\nsee how it kept my old address?\n\n216\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.180\nIt's smart enough to know, we don't wanna\nditch the old email address because\n\n217\n00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.030\nyou probably are receiving email there.\n\n218\n00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.685\nSo it just adds to the second one.\n\n219\n00:10:15.685 --> 00:10:18.600\nIt's not part of the policy though so\nyou could come in and\n\n220\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.303\nremove this if you wanted if I wanted to\nget rid of it I could delete that and\n\n221\n00:10:22.303 --> 00:10:26.192\nnow its gone and it'll let me do that\nwithout overwriting the policy because\n\n222\n00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:29.715\nthat address is not part of the policy\nanymore right but this one is and\n\n223\n00:10:29.715 --> 00:10:33.456\nits stuck in there by default right\nnow lets talk about custom policies.\n\n224\n00:10:33.456 --> 00:10:38.141\nIn my company maybe I want to add a new\ndomain and so I decide I wanna add,\n\n225\n00:10:38.141 --> 00:10:39.260\nITProTV.net.\n\n226\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.253\nI want people to have that address,\nnot lab.itpro.tv,\n\n227\n00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:44.500\nso I want to add another one to it.\n\n228\n00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.840\nWhile I could go through to each\nuser individually if I wanted to,\n\n229\n00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.790\nor I could modify my recipient policy.\n\n230\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.730\nAnd when I modify that policy we can add\nmultiple addresses if we want, all right?\n\n231\n00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.030\nAnd you can even do filters\nto limit who it applies to,\n\n232\n00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.140\nyou can do all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n233\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.390\nSo I'm gonna add in a new policy,\nand when I create this new policy,\n\n234\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.040\nI'm gonna call it ITProTV Employees.\n\n235\n00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.800\nI'm just giving it a name, and\nthen I'm gonna specify my address format.\n\n236\n00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.500\nSo I want everybody to have an address and\n\n237\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.320\nI want that address to\nfollow a certain format.\n\n238\n00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.840\nWell, I want it to have\nmy name@itprotv.net.\n\n239\n00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:24.590\nWell right here we've got select accepted\ndomain, and I only have lab.itpro.tv.\n\n240\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.720\nWhen you install Exchange, it asks you\nwhat your email address domain is.\n\n241\n00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.035\nAnd this is what I punched\nin when I installed it.\n\n242\n00:11:31.035 --> 00:11:34.160\nIt doesn't know about any\nother domains I might own.\n\n243\n00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.510\nSo if any other emails come into\nmy server that's destined for,\n\n244\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:42.280\nsay, ITProTV.net, I own that domain, but\nExchange doesn't know about it, and so\n\n245\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.250\nit's gonna throw those emails away.\n\n246\n00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.200\nSo, I have to tell the Exchange Server\nthat it's okay to get email on those\n\n247\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.900\nnetworks and allow them to come in.\n\n248\n00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.268\nSo I'm gonna make sure that\nI've provided that information.\n\n249\n00:11:52.268 --> 00:11:55.020\nSo, I'm gonna cancel\nout of this policy and\n\n250\n00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.040\nyou'll see right up here,\naccepted domains.\n\n251\n00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.800\nHere's where we dictate what\ndomains are considered local.\n\n252\n00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.550\nIn other words, mailboxes for\n\n253\n00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.040\nthese domains should exist right here,\nall right?\n\n254\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.930\nThese are not gonna be, you know,\nHotmail or Gmail or anything like that.\n\n255\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.460\nThose mailboxes reside somewhere else but\nlab.itprotv, that's us.\n\n256\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:19.690\nI can add in ITProTV.NET or\nany other domains that I might have,\n\n257\n00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.210\nI can come in and\npunch them in right here, all right.\n\n258\n00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.300\nAnd then you dictate what\nkind of domain it is.\n\n259\n00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.010\nThe default is an authoritative domain\nthat means the mail box is right here.\n\n260\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.880\nLet the e-mail come in,\nif we don't have the mail box,\n\n261\n00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.440\nthen the e-mail just doesn't exist.\n\n262\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.990\nThrow it out at bat, right?\n\n263\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.170\nBut if we have the mailbox,\nput the email in the mailbox.\n\n264\n00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.320\nYou could say internal relay.\n\n265\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.380\nIf you got really old Exchange Servers,\nor Lotus Domino, some other kind of\n\n266\n00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.630\nemail system, you might receive an email,\nand look to see if you have the mailbox.\n\n267\n00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.891\nAnd if you don't have the mailbox, then\nyou forward the email to another server in\n\n268\n00:12:52.891 --> 00:12:55.486\nyour organization that\nmight have that mailbox so\n\n269\n00:12:55.486 --> 00:12:58.480\nthis is a way that we link to\nthird-party email systems.\n\n270\n00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.380\nLastly, you've got external relay.\n\n271\n00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.644\nThat says, we don't have the mailbox,\nbut if that email comes in,\n\n272\n00:13:03.644 --> 00:13:05.664\nwe'll relay it to another destination.\n\n273\n00:13:05.664 --> 00:13:11.085\nBe careful with this, any kind of relay\nis something that can be abused for spam.\n\n274\n00:13:11.085 --> 00:13:15.280\nPeople could start relaying email through\nyour server to send spam to whatever\n\n275\n00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.040\ndomains you provide here.\n\n276\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.260\nSo this would really need to\nbe a domain that you owned.\n\n277\n00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.390\nSo I've got a second domain.\n\n278\n00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.890\nIt's on a separate mail system.\n\n279\n00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:25.120\nIf I receive email for it, don't throw it\nout, just forward it over to that server.\n\n280\n00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.550\nBut in my case,\nif my mail box is right here so\n\n281\n00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.770\nI'm going to stick with authoritative and\nI'll just go ahead and hit Save.\n\n282\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.450\nNow you can give it a name,\nthe name could be what ever you want.\n\n283\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.470\nI almost always type in the domain names,\nthat's what I did and so\n\n284\n00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:41.192\nI've got itpt.net is\nnow an accepted domain.\n\n285\n00:13:41.192 --> 00:13:43.700\nAll right,\nnow I do need to go a step further and\n\n286\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.810\nsay well if somebody is going\nto send an email to ITProTV.net\n\n287\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.760\nhow does it even know to come to\nthis server in the first place?\n\n288\n00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.280\nRight?\n\n289\n00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.150\nWell for that I'd have to go and\nmodify the MX records in DNS and\n\n290\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.500\nthat's going to tell it to let\nthat email come over here.\n\n291\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.586\nBut we'll deal with that\nin another episode.\n\n292\n00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:02.096\nBut for right now I've got that added as\nan accepted domain so I can jump back\n\n293\n00:14:02.096 --> 00:14:06.908\nto my email address policies, and I can\nadd in my new ITProTV employees policy.\n\n294\n00:14:09.229 --> 00:14:11.610\nAnd then I can punch in my address format.\n\n295\n00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.950\nAnd now,\nI'll be able to pick that other domain.\n\n296\n00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.270\nI want these employees to have\nan ITProTV .NET address, and\n\n297\n00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.770\nI want it to be first initial,\nlast name @ ITProTV.net.\n\n298\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.330\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose that and I'll save it.\n\n299\n00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.690\nSo there's their default address.\n\n300\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.480\nBut I also want them to have the lab one\njust in case somebody's using that, right?\n\n301\n00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.308\nSo I might come in and\nadd that one in too.\n\n302\n00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:36.600\nI'll add lab.ITProTV and\n\n303\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.230\non this one I'll stick with the alias\nbecause that's how the old way was set up.\n\n304\n00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.760\nI want compatibility with the old way,\nright?\n\n305\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.090\nAnd I could make this the default,\nbut I don't want it to be,\n\n306\n00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.230\nI just want it to be a secondary address.\n\n307\n00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.830\nSo now people in ITProTV\nwill get both addresses.\n\n308\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:54.565\nAnd I could even add more, you know maybe\nI wanted to add first name dot last name\n\n309\n00:14:54.565 --> 00:14:58.420\n@ITPROTV.net, I could add that in.\n\n310\n00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.800\nJust in case somebody tries\nto email in that format,\n\n311\n00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.520\nyou can add as many addresses as you want.\n\n312\n00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.250\nSo I'm just gonna punch these in and then\nright here we get a sequence number for\n\n313\n00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.470\nthe policies.\n\n314\n00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.420\nRemember I said only one\npolicy can apply to a user.\n\n315\n00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.220\nIf we match more than\none how does it pick a?\n\n316\n00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.910\nIt's this policy sequence number, right?\n\n317\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.170\nSo I'm creating sequence number one and\nanybody that matches this,\n\n318\n00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.510\nthis is what's going to apply.\n\n319\n00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:25.666\nAnd so I can filter it right down\nhere to change who it's applying to.\n\n320\n00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:28.819\nSo for example,\nI might want to have more than one OU, and\n\n321\n00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:31.528\nthis only applies to people\nwho need ITProTV OU.\n\n322\n00:15:31.528 --> 00:15:32.140\nSo, I'm gonna do that.\n\n323\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.670\nI'm gonna limit this to users\nwith exchange mailboxes and\n\n324\n00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.600\nI'm gonna add a rule.\n\n325\n00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.121\nAnd the rule is I'm gonna limit\nit to a recipient container and\n\n326\n00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:44.113\nI'm gonna limit it just to\npeople in the ITProTV OU.\n\n327\n00:15:44.113 --> 00:15:47.452\nIf you're outside the ITProTV OU, and\nthis policy doesn't apply to you,\n\n328\n00:15:47.452 --> 00:15:48.675\nyou move on to the next one.\n\n329\n00:15:48.675 --> 00:15:50.173\nRight, I'm limiting that.\n\n330\n00:15:50.173 --> 00:15:53.891\nSo If I'm supporting more than one\ncompany, I can create an OU for\n\n331\n00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:58.354\neach company and do a separate email\naddress policy for each OU, and now people\n\n332\n00:15:58.354 --> 00:16:03.340\nare getting the default address of their\ncompany, and that's really important.\n\n333\n00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.670\nIt gives everyone their identity,\nit kind of keeps everyone separate.\n\n334\n00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.470\nSo I'll go ahead and save that.\n\n335\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.040\nAnd now I have that new policy in place\nand I get that warning about it not being\n\n336\n00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.140\nactive yet, so\nI gotta make sure that I activate it.\n\n337\n00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.400\nSo my default policy is applied,\nI'm gonna go to ITProTV employees and\n\n338\n00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.824\nI'm gonna apply that one.\n\n339\n00:16:21.824 --> 00:16:26.490\nAnd its gonna look for anybody in\nthe ITProTV OU that has a mailbox and\n\n340\n00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.820\nits going to apply that policy to it,\nall right.\n\n341\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.180\nAnd you'll see that priority number.\n\n342\n00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.140\nAnd you got a couple arrows here, so\nyou can move policies up and down,\n\n343\n00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.170\nbased on what it is that you need.\n\n344\n00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.870\nYou can kinda set that\norder after the fact.\n\n345\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.640\nAll right,\nlet's see what that did to my users.\n\n346\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.180\nIf I jump over to recipients,\nI can look down and\n\n347\n00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.540\nI'm not seeing a big change here,\ncuz I need to hit refresh.\n\n348\n00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.480\nThere we go.\n\n349\n00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.803\nAnd looking down the list, notice how\nBob Denver is now BDenver@itprotv.net.\n\n350\n00:16:50.803 --> 00:16:54.240\nI'm DPaset@itprotv.net, so\nI know that it took effect, but\n\n351\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.063\nif I look at John Travolta,\nhe's still JTravolta@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n352\n00:16:59.063 --> 00:17:00.140\nWhy is that?\n\n353\n00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.690\nHe's not in the ITProTV OU.\n\n354\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.019\nHe's not in the OU, so\nthe policy's not applying to him.\n\n355\n00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.120\nNow, if I move him into that OU,\nnow the policy does apply, and\n\n356\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.550\nat the next maintenance interval\nit will update his address.\n\n357\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.420\nIt will update people automatically,\nwhich is kinda nice.\n\n358\n00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.990\nBut as I add new employees,\nthey're gonna get the proper address.\n\n359\n00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.130\nSo if I'll come in here, and\nI'll add a new user mailbox.\n\n360\n00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.630\nAnd so I'll create one,\nlet's do, Clint Eastwood.\n\n361\n00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:33.770\nSo I'm gonna create an e-mail,\nmailbox for Clint Eastwood.\n\n362\n00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:37.130\nAll right, so there's his display name.\n\n363\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:43.280\nFor his organizational unit,\nI'm gonna put him in to ITProTV,\n\n364\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:50.470\nand we'll just give him a quick password,\nthere we go.\n\n365\n00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.730\nAnd I'll go ahead and save that,\nso it's gonna create his account.\n\n366\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.740\nAnd it's gonna see the policy\nthat applies to him and\n\n367\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.010\ngive him the appropriate addresses.\n\n368\n00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.950\nIt's gonna hit that\nITProTV employees policy.\n\n369\n00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.190\nBut then if I create another user and\nI put them somewhere other than ITProTV,\n\n370\n00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.310\nthen the default policy will apply and\nthey'll get a different address.\n\n371\n00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.920\nOr at least eventually when\nthe system decides to create it.\n\n372\n00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.870\nSo [LAUGH] that'll happen eventually, but\nyou guys get an idea here of how to set\n\n373\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.610\nthese email address policies up,\ngetting them in place and\n\n374\n00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.050\ngetting people the information they\nneed to be able to communicate.\n\n375\n00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.990\nKey things to remember here, definitely\nmake sure you set that accepted domain.\n\n376\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.320\nIf I add email addresses to somebody and\nits a domain that I'm not accepting,\n\n377\n00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.250\nthen it's gonna get blocked,\nthe email's just gonna get dropped.\n\n378\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.480\nSo we're gonna make sure we add\nit to an accepted domain first,\n\n379\n00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.600\nand then add it to our policy.\n\n380\n00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.980\nOh there, it just finished.\n\n381\n00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.930\nAll right, so I can see that Clint\nEastwood did get CEastwood@itprotv.net,\n\n382\n00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.470\nhe's got the right address.\n\n383\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.450\nAnd if I edit him,\nhe should have three addresses, right?\n\n384\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.560\nSo, if I look, sure enough,\nhe's got all three.\n\n385\n00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.290\nHe's also has Clint.Eastwood@ITProTV.net,\nand ClintEastwood@Lab.ITProTV.\n\n386\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.590\nHe's getting all the addresses\nfrom that policy.\n\n387\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:59.270\nAnd if I create another user,\nand maybe we'll do,\n\n388\n00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.999\nI don't know, let's do Telly Savalas.\n\n389\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.070\nI'm really digging deep here for actors.\n\n390\n00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.870\nSo [LAUGH] we'll punch in Telly Savalas.\n\n391\n00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.410\nWe're gonna give him an account.\n\n392\n00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:16.000\nAnd for his OU, I\"m just gonna\nput him in the regular users OU.\n\n393\n00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.770\nHe's not gonna be in ITProTV,\nand we'll punch in a password.\n\n394\n00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:25.950\nThere we go.\n\n395\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:26.920\nAnd so it's gonna create his account.\n\n396\n00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.580\nHe's not an ITProTV,\nthe default policy will apply to him.\n\n397\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.720\nHe'll get a different set of addresses.\n\n398\n00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.120\nSo, really cool to have\nthat flexibility and\n\n399\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.930\nthe fact that we can modify\nthis policy after the fact and\n\n400\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.250\nit updates all of our users, makes\nmanaging email addresses really easy.\n\n401\n00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:44.130\nJust be aware,\nthat if you disable the policy on a user,\n\n402\n00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:49.060\nif you override it, then from now on, from\nnow until eternity, you'll have to go and\n\n403\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.260\nmanually edit that user\nto add new addresses.\n\n404\n00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.460\nAnd so that makes things\na little more burdensome.\n\n405\n00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.310\nSo yeah, sure enough, Telly has been\ncreated and he doesn't have ITProTV.net.\n\n406\n00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:02.180\nHe just has lab.ITPro.TV and if I edit\nhis account and take a look at his\n\n407\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.900\nemail addresses, he didn't end up with\nthe three addresses, he just got the one.\n\n408\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.665\nDifferent policy, for the different user.\n\n409\n00:20:09.585 --> 00:20:11.025\nAll right, well in this episode,\n\n410\n00:20:11.025 --> 00:20:14.335\nwe got a chance to see our email\naddress policies and how they work.\n\n411\n00:20:14.335 --> 00:20:16.685\nWe got to see how to assign\nthose to different OU's, so\n\n412\n00:20:16.685 --> 00:20:19.905\nthat different users got different\naddresses based on their needs.\n\n413\n00:20:19.905 --> 00:20:23.145\nAnd we got a chance to see the accepted\ndomain screen which we haven't messed with\n\n414\n00:20:23.145 --> 00:20:27.275\nyet, where we can add more domains to\nour system to be able to receive those.\n\n415\n00:20:27.275 --> 00:20:28.680\nSo pretty neat stuff.\n\n416\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.720\nAll said and done, definitely something\nthat you're gonna have to configure in\n\n417\n00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.470\nyour environment if you have more than one\nemail domain, or if you just want people\n\n418\n00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.960\nto have more than one address to\ncatch typos or things like that.\n\n419\n00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.080\nYou'll want to mess around with\nthe policies and the addresses.\n\n420\n00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.210\nSo pretty cool stuff, definitely useful.\n\n421\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.020\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n422\n00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.631\nThat's all for our show, so signing\noff for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet, and\n\n423\n00:20:48.631 --> 00:20:49.848\nI'll see you next time.\n\n424\n00:20:49.848 -->

00:00:15.940\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.960\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again with\nanother episode of Microsoft Exchange\n\n5\n00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.080\n2013, and in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at client connectivity.\n\n6\n00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.510\nNow we've talked about client access\nservers before and how they serve as that\n\n7\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.310\ngateway for people to get inside of\ntheir network, and access their email.\n\n8\n00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.220\nBut what we haven't talked about are all\nthe different ways that somebody can\n\n9\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.850\nconnect, and there's actually quite a few.\n\n10\n00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.500\nOn the exam, they really want you\nto know the four big ones, so\n\n11\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.050\nwe're gonna take a look at those and kind\nof look at how that connectivity works.\n\n12\n00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.230\nAnd if you're somebody who's been\nworking with Microsoft exchange for\n\n13\n00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.480\na long time,\nwell things have changed a little bit, so\n\n14\n00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.210\nwe need to be aware of some of\nthe changes that have happened, and\n\n15\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.600\nsee how people get into our system\nin the first place, all right.\n\n16\n00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.320\nWell let me just run down\nthe big four real quick,\n\n17\n00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.370\nwhen somebody connects\nto Microsoft Exchange,\n\n18\n00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.020\nthere's really four primary methods\nthey can use to connect, right.\n\n19\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.550\nThe original method that Microsoft\ndeveloped for Exchange, this is way back.\n\n20\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.710\nJust to give you an example, the first\nversion of Exchange that I worked with was\n\n21\n00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.420\nMicrosoft Exchange 5.0, and it was back\nin 1999 or 2000, right around in there.\n\n22\n00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.960\nSo a very long time ago.\n\n23\n00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.080\nAnd their primary connectivity\nmethod was a protocol called MAPI.\n\n24\n00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.430\nAnd MAPI stood for the Messaging\nApplication Programming Interface.\n\n25\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.930\nAnd it was designed for Microsoft Outlook,\nso Microsoft Outlook used a proprietary\n\n26\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.860\nprotocol to connect directly to Exchange,\nand the reason Microsoft did that was\n\n27\n00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.140\nbecause it allowed Outlook to connect\ndirectly to the mailbox database.\n\n28\n00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.060\nOutlook could actually take email and\nstick it right in the database, and\n\n29\n00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.390\nit could grab email\nright from the database.\n\n30\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.790\nAnd back then,\nyou just had one Exchange server.\n\n31\n00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.800\nYou didn't have all these\nseparate roles like we do now.\n\n32\n00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.700\nBut over time, as Microsoft started\nbreaking things into separate roles,\n\n33\n00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.770\nwe ended up with some problems, right.\n\n34\n00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.650\nFor example,\nyou might have hub transport rules,\n\n35\n00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.670\nrules that do something like apply a legal\ndisclaimer to the bottom of an email.\n\n36\n00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.920\nSo if you're attaching a legal\ndisclaimer to an email,\n\n37\n00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.930\nas it passes through your system,\nwell you need to be able to catch it,\n\n38\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.580\nintercept the email while it\npasses through to add that.\n\n39\n00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.400\nBut with the old MAPI protocol if\nsomebody was sending an email and\n\n40\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.060\nthey were an internal user and\nthey were emailing another internal user,\n\n41\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.150\nit would go right into the database.\n\n42\n00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.770\nBut we had no way to apply those rules,\nand so that was a problem.\n\n43\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.270\nAnd so starting back in Exchange 2007,\n\n44\n00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.210\nMicrosoft started to swap that around and\nthey said,\n\n45\n00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.890\nfrom now on all e-mail has to go through\na hub transport server regardless of\n\n46\n00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.470\nwhether it's MAPI or not, it's got to\ngo through that hub transport server.\n\n47\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.500\nAnd when that happened It really, kind of,\n\n48\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.250\nstarted to spell the end of MAPI,\nthat MAPI wasn't as useful anymore.\n\n49\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.740\nYou used to get better performance,\nbecause you went right to the database,\n\n50\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.310\nbut you don't anymore, and\nso now you've lost that.\n\n51\n00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.220\nAnd, so instead,\nwe start moving out into some\n\n52\n00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.890\nother protocols that\nare gonna be more common, so.\n\n53\n00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.490\nIf I were doing this show ten years ago,\nMAPI would be like the primary method for\n\n54\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.540\nconnecting.\n\n55\n00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.830\nToday, it's very rarely used, right?\n\n56\n00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.600\nSo it's not really common at all.\n\n57\n00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.060\nSo instead, we're gonna see one\nof the three other connections.\n\n58\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.510\nThe other connection, the one that\nMicrosoft considers the primary one now,\n\n59\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.470\nis what's called Outlook Anywhere.\n\n60\n00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.530\nOutlook Anywhere is where we\ntake that MAPI type traffic, and\n\n61\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.050\nwe send it over HTTP.\n\n62\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.750\nNow they don't call it MAPI anymore,\nbecause we've lost that messaging API, and\n\n63\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.310\nso instead it's now called RPC over HTTP,\nor the remote procedure call over HTTP.\n\n64\n00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.450\nNow, the neat thing about that is it's\ngoing to take your email traffic,\n\n65\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.180\nthis direct software access\nthat comes out of Outlook, and\n\n66\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.610\nit's gonna send it over to the HTTP.\n\n67\n00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.390\nOr really the HTTPs, right?\n\n68\n00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.975\nSo tccp port 443,\nwhich is allowed on almost every network.\n\n69\n00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:56.140\nMAPI might be blocked on a firewall.\n\n70\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.440\nBut HTTPs,\nalmost everybody lets that's through.\n\n71\n00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.680\nAnd so outlook could be running\ninside your environment, outside.\n\n72\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.610\nYou can be anywhere in the world,\nand you can connect back to\n\n73\n00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.280\nyour exchange server and\nestablish that connection to your mailbox.\n\n74\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.980\nThat's outlook anywhere, and\n\n75\n00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.070\nthat's the primary connectivity\nmethod that Microsoft has.\n\n76\n00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.560\nWhen you fire up Microsoft Outlook,\nas an internal or external users or\n\n77\n00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.715\nwhatever, it's outlook anywhere\nthat you're using to connect with.\n\n78\n00:04:20.715 --> 00:04:23.335\nThere are two more for\nour backwards compatibility.\n\n79\n00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:28.225\nThere's POP3 and IMAP4, and\nthose two have been around a long time.\n\n80\n00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:31.085\nThose are the original email protocols,\nnot created by Microsoft.\n\n81\n00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:33.945\nMicrosoft made MAPI,\nMicrosoft made Outlook Anywhere.\n\n82\n00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:37.075\nBut POP3 and IMAP4,\nthose were created back in the Unix days,\n\n83\n00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:41.410\nreally in the late 70s,\nearly 80s, a long time ago.\n\n84\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.750\nAnd they're very prevalent.\n\n85\n00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.910\nPOP3 not so much anymore but\nIMAP4 is still very prevalent out there.\n\n86\n00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.430\nAny device can connect to an exchange\nserver using IMAP4, if it's a Blackberry,\n\n87\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.580\nan Iphone, Android tablet,\na Linux box, a Mac, a Windows Pc.\n\n88\n00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.950\nPretty much everybody supports POP3 and\nIMAP4.\n\n89\n00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.090\nBut there's some features we lose out on.\n\n90\n00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.850\nAnd that's where we'd rather\nhave Outlook Anywhere.\n\n91\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.080\nWe'd rather run Microsoft Outlook.\n\n92\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.930\nAnd be able to connect that way.\n\n93\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.310\nSo those are the four\nprimary connection methods.\n\n94\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.490\nThere's one or two more that I should\nprobably mention here that might pop up,\n\n95\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.390\nwhich are things like\nExchange ActiveSync an Outlook Web App.\n\n96\n00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.980\nAll right?\n\n97\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.820\nThose are not the common connectivity\nmethods, cuz it's not really a client\n\n98\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.170\nconnecting anymore, but it's you using\na client that runs directly on the server.\n\n99\n00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.260\nSo, Outlook Web App.\n\n100\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.690\nOutlook Web App,\nyou're pulling up a webpage.\n\n101\n00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.428\nAnd the webpage has all your email.\n\n102\n00:05:32.428 --> 00:05:34.970\nWell that web page is being\nrendered by the server itself, so\n\n103\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.990\nyou're not running a client,\nyou run a web browser to do it that way.\n\n104\n00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.960\nSo it's not like a client\nconnectivity method, but\n\n105\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.090\nit is a way to get into your email, so\nOutlook Web App is pretty important, and\n\n106\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.880\nActiveSync is the same thing,\nbut for mobile devices.\n\n107\n00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.130\nSo if you have an iOS phone or an Android\nphone, Windows Mobile, they can only\n\n108\n00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.412\nuse Exchange ActiveSync to connect right\ninto that mailbox and get your access.\n\n109\n00:05:55.412 --> 00:05:58.750\nAnd ActiveSync is doing the bulk of the\ndata rendering on its side on the server\n\n110\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.930\nside, and you phone is just rendering on\nthe screen in typically a web browser or\n\n111\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.710\nsome other kind of mail\nclient that's been defined.\n\n112\n00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.570\nSo, those are a little bit different.\n\n113\n00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.950\nBut these are all different\nmechanisms somebody can connect with.\n\n114\n00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.980\nThe key thing to remember,\nis that they're not always turned on.\n\n115\n00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.980\nThat you can turn these on and\noff based on your own needs.\n\n116\n00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.530\nYou may want some of them,\nyou may not want others.\n\n117\n00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.250\nSome are turned on by default,\nsome are turned off by default.\n\n118\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.700\nSo in this episode, I want to go through\neach one, and just kind of examine them,\n\n119\n00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.450\nsee how they work, and\nsee how we can turn them on and off.\n\n120\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.320\nAll right.\n\n121\n00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.660\nThe first thing I wanna show you,\n\n122\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.000\nis kinda how these show up inside\nof the exchange admin center.\n\n123\n00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.570\nSo I'm gonna pull up my server here, and\nI've got a client access server pulled up\n\n124\n00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.820\nhere, and I can basically get\ninto my exchange admin centers.\n\n125\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.820\nJust let me log into that real quick.\n\n126\n00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.090\nAnd when I get logged in to\nthe exchange admin center,\n\n127\n00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.980\nI'm gonna see my recipients, right?\n\n128\n00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.330\nThat's the default screen,\nwhen you pullout the admin center.\n\n129\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.820\nI'll see my recipients here, and for\neach recipient, I can turn on and\n\n130\n00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.940\noff the connectivity methods individually,\nright?\n\n131\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.900\nWhen I start to choose a user,\nso like if I choose James Smith.\n\n132\n00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.690\nHere's James Smith.\n\n133\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.080\nAnd over on the right side\nI can see some options.\n\n134\n00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.740\nNot all the options that I want, but I can\nsee here disable exchange active scene,\n\n135\n00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.710\ndisable OWA for devices.\n\n136\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.580\nSo, there's a few little things there.\n\n137\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.140\nBut I don't see anything for Pop3 or\nIMap4, or that kind of stuff.\n\n138\n00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.300\nSo, for\nthat I've really got the edit the users.\n\n139\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.050\nSo if I come in here and edit James, and\n\n140\n00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.490\nI go in here, you'll start to\nsee some different options.\n\n141\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.070\nThe one I'm looking for\nis mailbox features.\n\n142\n00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.130\nAnd right here in mailbox features,\nI'll see some of the same stuff.\n\n143\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.260\nHere's disable exchange active scene.\n\n144\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.060\nDisable OWA for devices.\n\n145\n00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.620\nRight?\n\n146\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.670\nBut I'll also see Outlook Web App.\n\n147\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.490\nI can disable that or enable it.\n\n148\n00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.307\nIf you see disable,\nthat means it's already enabled and so\n\n149\n00:07:46.307 --> 00:07:47.385\nthis one is turned on.\n\n150\n00:07:47.385 --> 00:07:51.760\nI can see IMap, Pop3 and MAPI,\nand how all of them are enabled,\n\n151\n00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.616\nthat means that by default, this user can\nconnect with any of these methods, right?\n\n152\n00:07:57.616 --> 00:07:59.363\nWell, that's not entirely true.\n\n153\n00:07:59.363 --> 00:08:04.640\nBecause, for example, the IMAP and\nPOP3 services are disabled by default.\n\n154\n00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.529\nSo she's allowed to connect,\nbut if she tries,\n\n155\n00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:09.073\nit's going to fail,\ncuz the server is not configured properly.\n\n156\n00:08:09.073 --> 00:08:11.590\nSo there's really two pieces\nof the configuration.\n\n157\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.611\nThere's the server side and\nthen there's the user, the recipient side.\n\n158\n00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:18.132\nWe have to have the services\nenabled on the server and\n\n159\n00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:21.430\nthen we have to have the services\nallowed for the recipient.\n\n160\n00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.432\nAnd here,\nwe can see they're all allowed for her.\n\n161\n00:08:23.432 --> 00:08:26.935\nBut maybe I don't want her to use POP3,\nso I could come in here and\n\n162\n00:08:26.935 --> 00:08:29.690\nI could hit Disable and\nit's gonna disable POP3.\n\n163\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.338\nAnd so now it says, POP3 Disabled and\nI can turn it back on, if I want.\n\n164\n00:08:33.338 --> 00:08:35.806\nBut otherwise,\nshe can't connect via POP3 anymore,\n\n165\n00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:37.970\nbut her other protocols\nare still turned on.\n\n166\n00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.921\nSo here's where we can see all those\ndifferent connectivity methods and\n\n167\n00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:42.476\nwe can kinda tweak and work with that.\n\n168\n00:08:42.476 --> 00:08:46.500\nNow notice how Outlook Anywhere\ndoesn't show up in here.\n\n169\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.900\nAnd that's because Outlook Anywhere or\n\n170\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.310\nRPC over HTTP,\nthat's wrapped up here under MAPI.\n\n171\n00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.488\nBy the time it gets to the server,\nit just looks like MAPI traffic.\n\n172\n00:08:56.488 --> 00:09:01.690\nIt's been tunneled over HTTP to get to the\nserver, so it's kind of wrapped together.\n\n173\n00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:02.550\nThose used to be separate.\n\n174\n00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.718\nIn earlier versions of Exchange\nthey were separate, but\n\n175\n00:09:05.718 --> 00:09:09.230\nnow all the connectivity is\nshown as Outlook Anywhere.\n\n176\n00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.940\nLet me show you,\ncuz this can get a little confusing.\n\n177\n00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.030\nI wanna show you an example.\n\n178\n00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.935\nSo let me jump back to an actual client.\n\n179\n00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:18.450\nSo here, I am on a Windows 7 machine.\n\n180\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.952\nAnd if I fire up Outlook,\nI've got Outlook on this system and\n\n181\n00:09:21.952 --> 00:09:26.830\nI just used autodiscover, so\nit automatically configured itself.\n\n182\n00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.940\nIn previous versions of Exchange when it\nauto-configured, it would use MAPI and\n\n183\n00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.280\nit would connect directly to that server.\n\n184\n00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.904\nBut in newer versions,\nit uses Outlook Anywhere.\n\n185\n00:09:34.904 --> 00:09:38.690\nBut just looking at the client, we don't\nreally have a way of knowing that.\n\n186\n00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.360\nWhen I look at this down here at\nthe bottom, I can see connected to\n\n187\n00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.680\nMicrosoft Exchange, but it really\ndoesn't tell me about how I'm connected.\n\n188\n00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.450\nIt just says that I am connected,\nthat's terribly exciting.\n\n189\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.757\nSo [LAUGH] I don't really\nget to see how I connected.\n\n190\n00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.560\nIf I want to see that though,\nthere's a neat little hidden option.\n\n191\n00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.820\nDown by my system clock,\nI can see the Outlook icon right there.\n\n192\n00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.605\nAnd if you right-click on that icon,\nyou see some options here.\n\n193\n00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:03.697\nShow New Mail, most of this has\nto do with notifications, but\n\n194\n00:10:03.697 --> 00:10:05.230\nthere's a hidden option.\n\n195\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:11.340\nIf you hold Ctrl on your keyboard,\nif you hold Ctrl while you right-click.\n\n196\n00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.350\nSo if I hold Ctrl and right-click,\nI get some new options.\n\n197\n00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.717\nTest Email AutoConfiguration.\n\n198\n00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:18.690\nWe used that in the autodiscover episode.\n\n199\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.879\nIf you haven't seen that one, we used\nthat one to do some troubleshooting and\n\n200\n00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:24.055\ntesting, but\nright above it is Connection Status.\n\n201\n00:10:24.055 --> 00:10:25.851\nConnection Status is really useful,\n\n202\n00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:28.910\ncuz it shows you how you're\nconnected to the server.\n\n203\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.354\nAnd so I can look right in here and\nI can find out am I using POP3?\n\n204\n00:10:32.354 --> 00:10:33.395\nAm I using IMAP4?\n\n205\n00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:35.276\nAm I using Outlook Anywhere?\n\n206\n00:10:35.276 --> 00:10:36.436\nWhich one am I using?\n\n207\n00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:39.933\nAnd so I can see, I've got three\nconnections to the server and\n\n208\n00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:42.498\neach of mine are connected to lab-cas01.\n\n209\n00:10:42.498 --> 00:10:43.501\nIt's also really useful,\n\n210\n00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:45.910\ncuz you can see which client\naccess server you're connected to.\n\n211\n00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.736\nYou might have more than\none client access server.\n\n212\n00:10:47.736 --> 00:10:50.690\nHere, we'll figure out which\none we're connected to.\n\n213\n00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.470\nAnd see how it says, proxy server?\n\n214\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.635\nAnd then an actual server name here,\nwhat's that all about?\n\n215\n00:10:55.635 --> 00:10:58.940\nWell, the proxy server is\nyour client access server.\n\n216\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.212\nThe actual server is the mailbox\nserver on the back-end.\n\n217\n00:11:02.212 --> 00:11:05.990\nClient access servers are really just\nproxying your connection to the mailbox.\n\n218\n00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.511\nNobody is allowed to directly connect\nto the mailbox server anymore,\n\n219\n00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:10.597\nthose days are gone.\n\n220\n00:11:10.597 --> 00:11:12.410\nWe used to have that and now that's gone.\n\n221\n00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.388\nNow everybody connects to a client\naccess server, but at the end of the day\n\n222\n00:11:15.388 --> 00:11:18.859\nthe client access server is turning around\nand accessing the mailbox server for you.\n\n223\n00:11:18.859 --> 00:11:22.200\nThat way, you don't have to know what\nmailbox server your mailbox is on.\n\n224\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.645\nThe client access server\nwill figure that out.\n\n225\n00:11:23.645 --> 00:11:26.490\nYou just connect to any of the client\naccess servers in your network,\n\n226\n00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.310\nin your organization and\nyou'll get connected.\n\n227\n00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.562\nBut if I scroll over, I'll see a lot\nmore in protocol is what I'm looking for\n\n228\n00:11:34.562 --> 00:11:39.587\nright here and I can see the protocol\nlisted for my account is RPC/HTTP.\n\n229\n00:11:39.587 --> 00:11:41.738\nThat means I'm taking my MAPI traffic,\n\n230\n00:11:41.738 --> 00:11:45.240\nwhich is remote procedure\ncalled traffic or RPC traffic.\n\n231\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.840\nI'm encapsulating that in HTTP and\nits really doing SSL, so it'll be\n\n232\n00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.400\nTCP port 443 and sending it across\nthe network to the client access server.\n\n233\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.605\nThe client access server receives it,\ndecrypts the data,\n\n234\n00:11:57.605 --> 00:11:59.411\ncuz it's encrypted in transit.\n\n235\n00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:01.858\nDecrypts the data and\nthen figures out what it is,\n\n236\n00:12:01.858 --> 00:12:05.881\nreaches out to the mailbox server and gets\nthe appropriate data and the connection\n\n237\n00:12:05.881 --> 00:12:09.970\nbetween the client access server and\nthe mailbox server is encrypted also.\n\n238\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.120\nSo we have end-to-end encryption\neven on the local area network and\n\n239\n00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.500\nthat's really a nice feature to have,\nbut I can see that I'm connected.\n\n240\n00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.599\nI can see my RPC port is 6001.\n\n241\n00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:24.033\nBut I'm actually going over HTTP, so\nit's truly going over port 443, but\n\n242\n00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:26.183\nthe encapsulated port is 6001 and\n\n243\n00:12:26.183 --> 00:12:29.680\nI'm connected to an exchange\nserver on the other end.\n\n244\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.686\nNow, I have three connections open and\nI can see why right here.\n\n245\n00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:35.200\nOne connection is to\nthe Exchange directory.\n\n246\n00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.645\nThat's just to be able to look up\ncontacts, to be able to find distribution\n\n247\n00:12:39.645 --> 00:12:44.163\ngroups, to figure out what's in a\ndistribution group as well as to actually\n\n248\n00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:48.559\naccess my email and I usually have\na listening and a speaking connection.\n\n249\n00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:52.773\nSo, one of these is for listening for\nnew email coming from the server and\n\n250\n00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:54.070\nretrieving it.\n\n251\n00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.060\nThe other one is for sending email and\ncommunicating up to the server, so\n\n252\n00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:57.948\nI've got those two.\n\n253\n00:12:57.948 --> 00:13:00.110\nAnd if you scroll over here,\nyou can see this session type.\n\n254\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.383\nWe've got a background,\na foreground and a cache.\n\n255\n00:13:02.383 --> 00:13:05.839\nThese guys are all just kind of\nrunning and doing their activities, so\n\n256\n00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:08.030\nyou can see that health status.\n\n257\n00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.713\nA little over further, I can see the\nactual connection type here of HTTP and\n\n258\n00:13:11.713 --> 00:13:14.299\nthat I've got my connections\nthat are up and going.\n\n259\n00:13:14.299 --> 00:13:18.500\nSo really neat information here,\nall kinda hidden away in this tool.\n\n260\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.640\nThis is handy, because sometimes\nyou might fire up Outlook and\n\n261\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.032\nnot know is somebody running,\nare they running Outlook Anywhere?\n\n262\n00:13:25.032 --> 00:13:28.440\nAre they running POP3 or IMAP4,\nwhich one are they running?\n\n263\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.276\nHere we can find out.\n\n264\n00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:32.762\nYou just have to remember\nto hit Ctrl while you right\n\n265\n00:13:32.762 --> 00:13:38.160\nclick on the Outlook icon in the taskbar\nand you'll be able to see that.\n\n266\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.440\nSo those are some of the different things\nwe need to be aware of as far as client\n\n267\n00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.172\nconnectivity.\n\n268\n00:13:42.172 --> 00:13:46.060\nLet's take a look at some of the other\nthings that we might need to customize.\n\n269\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.618\nI mentioned, Outlook Anywhere.\n\n270\n00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:51.120\nNow, Outlook Anywhere is enabled by\ndefault when you install Exchange.\n\n271\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.731\nWe don't have to turn that on and\n\n272\n00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:56.679\nour Outlook clients will autodiscover\nthe server and configure themselves.\n\n273\n00:13:56.679 --> 00:13:59.180\nWell, for internal servers, they will.\n\n274\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.420\nIf they're outside the network,\nthey might not find it.\n\n275\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.814\nAnd so for outside users,\nthey've gotta use autodiscover and\n\n276\n00:14:04.814 --> 00:14:05.818\nwe've gotta tweak that.\n\n277\n00:14:05.818 --> 00:14:07.694\nSo if you haven't launched it,\n\n278\n00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:10.970\nwe did a two part episode on\nconfiguring autodiscover.\n\n279\n00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:11.926\nDefinitely jump back and\n\n280\n00:14:11.926 --> 00:14:14.255\ncheck that episode out,\ncuz we show how to take care of that.\n\n281\n00:14:14.255 --> 00:14:17.000\nBut otherwise, for our intro people,\nit's automatically configured.\n\n282\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.557\nAnd it's really nice, because you might\nhave 10,000 computers on your network.\n\n283\n00:14:20.557 --> 00:14:24.034\nAnd those 10,000 employees can sit down,\nthey can launch Outlook and\n\n284\n00:14:24.034 --> 00:14:26.857\nit will look to the Active Directory,\nfind their settings and\n\n285\n00:14:26.857 --> 00:14:28.500\ntake them right to their mailbox.\n\n286\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.338\nThey don't have to know\nthe name of the server.\n\n287\n00:14:30.338 --> 00:14:32.420\nThey don't have to know anything\nabout your infrastructure.\n\n288\n00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.632\nThey don't have to know IP addresses or\nport numbers.\n\n289\n00:14:34.632 --> 00:14:37.310\nThey just launch Outlook and\nit automatically configures.\n\n290\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.211\nIt's really awesome stuff,\no that's kind of cool.\n\n291\n00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:42.866\nThere's not much we need to\ntweak about Outlook Anywhere,\n\n292\n00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:45.480\nthere are a few little things\nthat we need tweaked though.\n\n293\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.470\nLet me show you, if I get back\ninto my Exchange Admin Center.\n\n294\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.320\nHere in the Exchange Admin Center,\nif I go down to servers.\n\n295\n00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.980\nUnder servers, I can see the list\nof servers that I have and\n\n296\n00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.100\nany client access server is\nan Outlook Anywhere connection point.\n\n297\n00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:05.900\nThey cal it an SCP or a service connection\npoint and any cast will work for that.\n\n298\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.232\nWell, if I go to virtual directories,\n\n299\n00:15:09.232 --> 00:15:12.972\nhere's where I can actually see\nthe Outlook Web App connection and\n\n300\n00:15:12.972 --> 00:15:17.681\nthe autodiscover connection and how people\nare getting connected to that system.\n\n301\n00:15:17.681 --> 00:15:20.695\nAnd these virtual directories\nare all dictating, basically,\n\n302\n00:15:20.695 --> 00:15:23.810\nthe names of these folders and\nhow people can connect.\n\n303\n00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.940\nWe don't normally need to tweak these,\nbut you can change the directory names.\n\n304\n00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.652\nIf you want people to connect to OWA\nunder a different folder or whatever, but\n\n305\n00:15:30.652 --> 00:15:34.750\nthese are being pulled in when people\nconnect via those other protocols.\n\n306\n00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.689\nNow the reason I bring this up is\nthat with Outlook Anywhere and\n\n307\n00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:43.639\nwith these virtual directories, SSL\ncertificates can be a bit of a problem.\n\n308\n00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:47.360\nWhen you install your server,\nit's automatically configured.\n\n309\n00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.277\nOutlook Anywhere is already running,\nbut it's running with a self-signed\n\n310\n00:15:51.277 --> 00:15:54.363\ncertificate and so\nare all these virtual directories here.\n\n311\n00:15:54.363 --> 00:15:56.732\nThey're all using a self\nsigned certificate and\n\n312\n00:15:56.732 --> 00:15:59.457\nthat means that your clients\nprobably won't trust it.\n\n313\n00:15:59.457 --> 00:16:02.845\nAnd if your clients don't trust it\nThen they're gonna fail to connect.\n\n314\n00:16:02.845 --> 00:16:06.953\nSo one of the things that we'll need to do\nis to jump over to our certificates and\n\n315\n00:16:06.953 --> 00:16:09.270\nget a certificate that they do trust.\n\n316\n00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.400\nThis certificate right here,\nthe one labelled Microsoft Exchange,\n\n317\n00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.600\nsee down here it's listed for IMAP, POP,\nIIS, SMTP, it's listed for all of them.\n\n318\n00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.050\nAnd so in order for this to work for\n\n319\n00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.010\npeople to connect, they're gonna\nhave to use this certificate.\n\n320\n00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.530\nIf they don't trust it, it's gonna fail.\n\n321\n00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.480\nThat means Outlook anywhere is gonna fail.\n\n322\n00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.640\nIt means the Outlook web app is\ngonna throw an error, in fact,\n\n323\n00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.030\nI should see that error right now.\n\n324\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:33.585\nIf I go to a client, and\nI try to log into the Outlook web app.\n\n325\n00:16:33.585 --> 00:16:36.355\nOh shoot, no,\nI must have trusted the certificate, so\n\n326\n00:16:36.355 --> 00:16:37.355\nI'm not getting that error.\n\n327\n00:16:37.355 --> 00:16:40.655\nBut if they to were use the full name of\nthe server they should get the error.\n\n328\n00:16:40.655 --> 00:16:46.403\nSo, if I do lab-caso1.itprotv.net/owa.\n\n329\n00:16:46.403 --> 00:16:49.717\nNope, I've already trusted that name too.\n\n330\n00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.665\nSo [LAUGH] if you haven't trusted the name\nthough, you're gonna get an error.\n\n331\n00:16:52.665 --> 00:16:55.060\nIt's gonna show the certificate\nis not trusted.\n\n332\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.640\nSo when it comes to Outlook anywhere,\n\n333\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.930\none of the only things that we ever really\nneed to configure is that certificate.\n\n334\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.470\nAnd it's just a matter of coming here\ninto certificates and issuing a new one.\n\n335\n00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.950\nIf you have your own public\nkey infrastructure, and\n\n336\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.800\nyour clients all trust it, then you\ncan just issue your own certificate.\n\n337\n00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.870\nBut if you don't have a public key\ninfrastructure, then you need to generate\n\n338\n00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.820\na certificate request and\ntake that to a trusted provider.\n\n339\n00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.160\nSomebody like VeriSign, Thought, DigiCert.\n\n340\n00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.510\nI like DigiCert, but\nyou can go to whatever one.\n\n341\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.230\nSubmit your certificate,\nand pay them some money.\n\n342\n00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.703\n[LAUGH] They'll issue you a certificate,\nand the nice part is that all your clients\n\n343\n00:17:27.703 --> 00:17:30.336\nwill trust that certificate,\nand now that system will work.\n\n344\n00:17:30.336 --> 00:17:33.157\nSo that's really one of the only\nthings that we needed tweak about\n\n345\n00:17:33.157 --> 00:17:34.250\nOutlook anywhere.\n\n346\n00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.020\nAnd that basic RPC over HTTP.\n\n347\n00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.360\nSome of the other protocols\nare a little more involved though.\n\n348\n00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.790\nOWA's automatically configured.\n\n349\n00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.790\nWe saw it right here in\nthe virtual directories.\n\n350\n00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.070\nI can find that OWA directory right there,\n\n351\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.750\nand it's attached to labcas01,\ncuz that's my client access server.\n\n352\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.960\nIf you have five cas, or\n\n353\n00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.470\nfive client access servers,\nyou'll see them all right here.\n\n354\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.060\nAnd you can filter it down if you want.\n\n355\n00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.940\nI can say like,\njust show me The OWA virtual directories.\n\n356\n00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.340\nAnd I would just see OWA for\nthose different client access servers.\n\n357\n00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.500\nAnd we can go in and configure them.\n\n358\n00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.160\nAnd by configure them,\nthere's really not much we can do.\n\n359\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.290\nIf you edit it, you can change that URL.\n\n360\n00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.370\nBut it's not really the greatest\nidea to change that,\n\n361\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.320\nbecause clients expect it\nto be in a certain place.\n\n362\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.670\nBut you can also add an external URL,\nand that is handy.\n\n363\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:22.060\nYou might have one URL for internal users,\nand another URL for external users.\n\n364\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.140\nAnd so, we can set that right here.\n\n365\n00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.260\nYou can also tweak their authentication.\n\n366\n00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.920\nNow for OWA,\nit's doing forms based authentication.\n\n367\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.330\nWhen you go to the webpage you see that\n\n368\n00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.530\nspot where it asks user name and\na password.\n\n369\n00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.690\nBut you might want to\nautomate that process, right.\n\n370\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.950\nAutomate the login process and\ndo Windows on occasion.\n\n371\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.400\nAnd so,\nyou'll see those options are in here.\n\n372\n00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.530\nYou can turn on integrated Windows\nauthentication or other ones.\n\n373\n00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.660\nThat form is the default.\n\n374\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.250\nAll right?\n\n375\n00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.830\nAnd notice the form,\nhow it's asking for domain/user name.\n\n376\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:50.700\nYou can tweak that.\n\n377\n00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.960\nLike, I can say, just take a user name,\nAnd then specify the domain by default.\n\n378\n00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.420\nSo if you only have one domain,\nyou might as well do this.\n\n379\n00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.320\nYou can set the domain, and now users can\nlog in just by putting in their username\n\n380\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.160\ninstead of having to do\ndomain slash username.\n\n381\n00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.840\nIt's a little more intuitive.\n\n382\n00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.850\nOr you can do user principal name.\n\n383\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.110\nAnd that's cool because if your user\nprincipal name is your e-mail address,\n\n384\n00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.720\npeople log in with their e-mail address.\n\n385\n00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:19.493\nSo my UPN is Itprotv.net,\nthen I can log in as DPizet@itprotv.net.\n\n386\n00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:20.990\nAll right, so\n\n387\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.530\nthose are a couple of different options\nthat we can tweak on Outlook Web Access.\n\n388\n00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.650\nNow we've also got support for\nPOP3 and IMAP4,\n\n389\n00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.470\nand ideally we're not going to\nuse those cuz they're, well,\n\n390\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.480\nnone of it's feature rich as doing\nthe Outlook anywhere connectivity.\n\n391\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.200\nBut, there's a reason for\nhaving them, right?\n\n392\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.515\nCompatibility.\n\n393\n00:19:37.515 --> 00:19:40.850\nPOP3 is pretty much compatible\nwith everything out there, but\n\n394\n00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:41.970\nit's got it's limitations.\n\n395\n00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.430\nYou know, it downloads emails and\nremoves them from the server by default.\n\n396\n00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.500\nThat means that if your client\nhas a failed hard drive or\n\n397\n00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.410\nwhatever, they could lose data.\n\n398\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:49.590\nThat's kind of bad.\n\n399\n00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.500\nAlso, POP3 doesn't play nice if\nyou have more than one machine.\n\n400\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.140\nIf you check an email and\nmark it as read on one machine,\n\n401\n00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.810\nthe other machine doesn't see that, so\nthat's kind of a problem with POP3.\n\n402\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.930\nAnd finally, it doesn't support folders,\nand I know for me, that's a showstopper.\n\n403\n00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.730\nI gotta have folders in my mailbox.\n\n404\n00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:08.560\nIMAP4, on the other hand, supports folders\nso you can do nice organizations, and\n\n405\n00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.040\nit leaves the emails on the server.\n\n406\n00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.010\nYou download the headers\nuntil you read them.\n\n407\n00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.680\nAnd if you mark an email as read on one\nmachine, your other machines will see it.\n\n408\n00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.840\nAnd IMAP4's still widely used today,\nbecause there's a lot of\n\n409\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.490\nclients out there that don't necessarily\nsupport Exchange, Active Sync or whatever.\n\n410\n00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.210\nIMAP4 is supported by\ndarn near everything.\n\n411\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.270\nWell, in Microsoft exchange\nwe have IMAP4 support,\n\n412\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.780\nand we have POP3 support,\nit's just turned off by default.\n\n413\n00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.900\nSo if we want to use it,\nwe need to jump in there and make and\n\n414\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.220\nmake a couple little\nconfiguration changes.\n\n415\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.510\nFirst off, we need to jump in\nto make sure that POP3 and\n\n416\n00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.920\nIMAP4 are enabled for our users.\n\n417\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.400\nAnd we saw at the beginning\nof the episode.\n\n418\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.670\nIt's enabled by default, so\nwe don't have to mess with that.\n\n419\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:48.619\nBut the IMAP4 and POP3 services\nare actually stopped on the server, so\n\n420\n00:20:48.619 --> 00:20:50.010\nwe need to fix that.\n\n421\n00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.830\nSo let's take a look at my server here and\nwe'll get that squared away.\n\n422\n00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:56.050\nSo what I need to do is, I need to\njump over to my client access server.\n\n423\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.690\nHere's my client access server.\n\n424\n00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:02.380\nAnd I'm just gonna go into my server\nmanager and go to tools and services.\n\n425\n00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.160\nAnd I'm gonna hunt down\nthe Microsoft Exchange POP3 and\n\n426\n00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.030\nIMAP4 services, so they're right down here\nin the exchange block, and here they are.\n\n427\n00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.380\nAnd see how they're set to manually start?\n\n428\n00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.132\nSo they're not started automatically,\nso I need to change that.\n\n429\n00:21:15.132 --> 00:21:17.900\nI'm gonna come in here and\njust set that to automatic, so\n\n430\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.820\nthey will start up when my system starts,\nand then I'll start the services myself.\n\n431\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.200\nNow, in previous versions of Exchange,\nthat's all we had to do.\n\n432\n00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.730\nWe just had to start these\ntwo services and that was it.\n\n433\n00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:33.560\nBut in Exchange 2013, POP3 and IMAP4 have\nnow been broken into a front end and\n\n434\n00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.960\na back end service.\n\n435\n00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.620\nAnd what I'm turning on here is actually\njust a front end, or a proxy, for POP3 and\n\n436\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.220\nIMAP4.\n\n437\n00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.270\nSo you connect to the front end server,\nand\n\n438\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.410\nthen it proxies you to\nthe back end server.\n\n439\n00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.760\nAnd that means I need to\njump to my mailbox servers.\n\n440\n00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.190\nAny mailbox server where I have mailboxes\nthat I need POP3 or IMAP4 support for,\n\n441\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:56.170\nI need to jump to that mailbox server,\nand turn on those services there too.\n\n442\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:00.510\nSo here I am on my mailbox server, and\nI'll just go to tools and services.\n\n443\n00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:04.480\nAnd I'm gonna hunt down not the exact\nsame service, but pretty close.\n\n444\n00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.300\nIf we browse down and\n\n445\n00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.790\nfind it, you'll notice that\nthe name is a little bit different.\n\n446\n00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:14.760\nSee how it's\nMicrosoft Exchange IMAP4 Backend, right?\n\n447\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.470\nThat's that backend service for IMAP4,\nand then the POP3 one right there too.\n\n448\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.370\nIt's a different service.\n\n449\n00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.540\nThis is the backend, but\nyou've gotta enable this too, or\n\n450\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.000\nit's not going to work.\n\n451\n00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.050\nSo I'm gonna get in here\nthat one to automatic.\n\n452\n00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.990\nAnd I'll start it up.\n\n453\n00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.690\nThat's POP3.\n\n454\n00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.150\nThen I'll do the same thing for IMAP4.\n\n455\n00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.440\nI'm doing them both together.\n\n456\n00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.430\nYou don't have to.\n\n457\n00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.330\nMaybe I don't need POP3,\nI just want IMAP4,\n\n458\n00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.250\nthen you can just turn that one on and\nleave POP3 off.\n\n459\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.900\nBy all means,\nleave services off if you don't need them,\n\n460\n00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.460\nIt just increase your tack surface.\n\n461\n00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.780\nAll right, the other thing is when\nI open these, I'm opening them,\n\n462\n00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.890\nI'm starting the services.\n\n463\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:53.770\nBut I might need to adjust my\nfirewall to allow port 110 or 143 for\n\n464\n00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:59.250\nPOP3 and IMAP4 unsecure, or 993 and\n995 first are the secure versions.\n\n465\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.190\nI might need to allow those\nthrough my firewall too.\n\n466\n00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.030\nAll right,\nthey're already clear on my firewalls, so\n\n467\n00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.350\nI don't have to worry about that.\n\n468\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.050\nBut at this stage, I should be good to go.\n\n469\n00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.600\nPOP3 and IMAP4 are enabled for my users.\n\n470\n00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.740\nI've now started the services.\n\n471\n00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.690\nThere's some basic\nconfiguration you can do.\n\n472\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:14.630\nYou don't have to, right.\n\n473\n00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.840\nI can jump down here to my servers and\ntake LabCastle1.\n\n474\n00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.840\nThere's my client access server.\n\n475\n00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.980\nAnd if I edit that I've got some POP3 and\nIMAP4 settings in here that I can tweak.\n\n476\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.430\nI can adjust the settings, but\nthere's not much to adjust.\n\n477\n00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.590\nThe port number it's running on,\nwhat type of encryption you're using.\n\n478\n00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.370\nYou'll see mine's defaulting to TLS and\nports that we're bound to.\n\n479\n00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.430\nThose are the things that we can tweak.\n\n480\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.980\nThere's not a whole lot\nof reason to tweak those.\n\n481\n00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.420\nAnd if we go into more options,\nit's mostly time out values.\n\n482\n00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.500\nSo all this different time out and\n\n483\n00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.670\nmaximum connections settings,\nthings we don't normally need to adjust.\n\n484\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.290\nSo usually starting the services\nis enough to get it going.\n\n485\n00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:48.590\nAnd we're in business.\n\n486\n00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.830\nSo let's test it out.\n\n487\n00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.230\nI'm gonna jump over to my client.\n\n488\n00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.270\nWell, I'm on my client.\n\n489\n00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.520\nAnd I wanna get connected\nwith a third party client.\n\n490\n00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.820\nI'm gonna connect with\na program called Postbox.\n\n491\n00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.731\nThis is what I like to use.\n\n492\n00:23:59.731 --> 00:24:02.807\nAnd in Postbox,\nI can add in that Exchange account.\n\n493\n00:24:02.807 --> 00:24:05.889\nSo I'm just gonna go up here to Tools and\noptions.\n\n494\n00:24:05.889 --> 00:24:09.820\nAnd over to my accounts,\nI'm gonna add in a new mail account.\n\n495\n00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.960\nAnd when I add it, I'll punch in account,\nI'll log in as Jane Smith.\n\n496\n00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.860\nSo I'm gonna punch hers in.\n\n497\n00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:20.480\nNow, I know that auto discover\nis not gonna work for this.\n\n498\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.553\nAuto discover is always gonna try and\nset you up for Outlook anywhere, right?\n\n499\n00:24:23.553 --> 00:24:25.350\nAnd I need to login with POP3 or IMAP4.\n\n500\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:30.770\nSo, I'm gonna have to go into my\nmanual setup option and specify that.\n\n501\n00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:31.750\nBut fortunately, it's pretty easy.\n\n502\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.726\nI can say here, username is jsmith,\nit's actually jsmith@itprotv.net, but\n\n503\n00:24:35.726 --> 00:24:36.830\nI can leave it jsmith.\n\n504\n00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:37.490\nIt'll be fine.\n\n505\n00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:40.140\nIf you have more than one domain,\nyou might need to specify a domain there.\n\n506\n00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.110\nI've only got one domain so\nI can leave it off.\n\n507\n00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:48.450\nMy server is lab-cas01.itprotv.net,\nand then the protocol.\n\n508\n00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.702\nI wanna use IMAP, and\nthen you'll see that port is 143.\n\n509\n00:24:51.702 --> 00:24:54.534\nNow 143 is nonsecure by default.\n\n510\n00:24:54.534 --> 00:24:57.762\nIf you're using SSL,\nyou wanna use 993, but\n\n511\n00:24:57.762 --> 00:25:02.515\neven when you connect on 143,\nyou can tell it to use TLS, all right?\n\n512\n00:25:02.515 --> 00:25:06.635\nAnd if we tell it to use TLS, it's gonna\nconnect on 143, that's immediately gonna\n\n513\n00:25:06.635 --> 00:25:10.335\nsay hey I wanna switch to transport layer\nsecurity, give me your certificate.\n\n514\n00:25:10.335 --> 00:25:13.225\nAnd then you'll do a key exchange and\nyou'll switch to encrypted and so\n\n515\n00:25:13.225 --> 00:25:14.345\nthat's what I'm gonna do.\n\n516\n00:25:14.345 --> 00:25:17.915\nAnd on the exchange side,\nit's set that way too, if I\n\n517\n00:25:17.915 --> 00:25:23.420\ngo back to my server settings around here\nsomewhere, and I find my IMAP4 settings.\n\n518\n00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.360\nSee how it's set for\nlog on method secure TLS?\n\n519\n00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.240\nAnd for that 143 it says TLS or\nunencrypted.\n\n520\n00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.830\nIf somebody connects unencrypted,\nit's not gonna let them log in,\n\n521\n00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.600\nbecause we're requiring TLS for log in.\n\n522\n00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.160\nAll right?\nSo\n\n523\n00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.610\nthat's gonna give me a secure connection.\n\n524\n00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.360\nThen my outgoing server, I can punch\nthat in, and I'm using the same for\n\n525\n00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.030\nmy outgoing server.\n\n526\n00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:43.890\nYou might have a different one.\n\n527\n00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.664\nAnd then we can specify SMTP,\nand it's much the same way.\n\n528\n00:25:47.664 --> 00:25:52.569\nWe've got port 25 for unencrypted,\nport 587 for encrypted, and with port 25,\n\n529\n00:25:52.569 --> 00:25:54.160\nyou could switch to SSL, but\n\n530\n00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.560\nmost of the time we're gonna use start\nTLS, which requires us to be on 587.\n\n531\n00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.710\nSo, I'm setting that up to be able\nto connect, and I'll go ahead and\n\n532\n00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.870\nfinish that up.\n\n533\n00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.534\nNow, assuming it works,\nI should be able to hit, get mail,\n\n534\n00:26:06.534 --> 00:26:09.253\nit's gonna reach out to the server,\nand get my email, if I put\n\n535\n00:26:09.253 --> 00:26:12.780\nthe wrong password in, that'll kinda\nslow things down a bit, but we'll see.\n\n536\n00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.890\nThere we go, I connected,\nand I can read my email.\n\n537\n00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.760\nSo, now I'm connected via IMAP4,\nso Outlook anywhere.\n\n538\n00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.830\nMAPI, right?\n\n539\n00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.690\nThe Messaging Application Programming\nInterface, those connectivities,\n\n540\n00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.650\nthose are the ones that\nMicrosoft wants you to use.\n\n541\n00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.610\nThose are fully featured.\n\n542\n00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:30.188\nThey give you your calendar,\nyour tasks, your contacts,\n\n543\n00:26:30.188 --> 00:26:32.633\nall that other stuff and email, right?\n\n544\n00:26:32.633 --> 00:26:36.113\nBut if you're using third party clients,\nif you're using mobile phones, or\n\n545\n00:26:36.113 --> 00:26:39.740\nwhatever, that don't have full exchange\nfunctionality, you can use IMAP4.\n\n546\n00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.650\nYou'll get all your email,\nyour folders, you can organize things.\n\n547\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.321\nYou lose your contacts, right?\n\n548\n00:26:45.321 --> 00:26:49.347\nYou lose your task list or your calendar,\nbut you can get those other ways.\n\n549\n00:26:49.347 --> 00:26:51.447\nRight?\nThere's other ways like Web DAV for\n\n550\n00:26:51.447 --> 00:26:56.380\npulling down contacts and stuff you can\ndo, or LDAP for pulling down contacts.\n\n551\n00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.720\nBut IMAP4 won't do it.\n\n552\n00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.930\nSo, if we just need email connectivity,\nIMAP4 works out pretty well.\n\n553\n00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.600\nPOP3 is there also which is far less\npopular, we just need to turn it on.\n\n554\n00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.976\nAll right, so in this episode we've got a\nchance to see quite a few different email\n\n555\n00:27:10.976 --> 00:27:12.283\nconnectivity methods.\n\n556\n00:27:12.283 --> 00:27:17.020\nWe started with talking about OWA and\nOutlook anywhere, and MAPI, right?\n\n557\n00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.470\nThose are the ones that\nMicrosoft wants us to use.\n\n558\n00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.690\nThen we talked about POP3 and IMAP4 which\nare also out there which are available for\n\n559\n00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.380\ncompatibility, so we've got those.\n\n560\n00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.350\nAnd at the end of the day, it's up to you\nto pick the ones that you want, the ones\n\n561\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.020\nthat you need or the ones that you even\nchoose to support for your clients.\n\n562\n00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.290\nCuz you might not wanna\nsupport all of those right?\n\n563\n00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.940\nSo you just kinda pick and choose.\n\n564\n00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.930\nGet the ones you need and\nget them in place.\n\n565\n00:27:37.992 --> 00:27:39.760\nAll right, so that's about it for\nthis episode.\n\n566\n00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.230\nThat's Client Connectivity,\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n567\n00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.940\nWe've got more exchange\ncontent coming down the road.\n\n568\n00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.340\nBut for now, signing off for\nIT Pro Tv, I'm Don Pizette and\n\n569\n00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.773\nI'll see you next time.\n\n570\n00:27:49.773 --> 00:27:55.990\n[SOUND]\n\n",

good evening and welcome back\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:17.840\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.230\nback again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.540\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at the mysterious\n\n7\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.910\nAutodiscover service.\n\n8\n00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.050\nNow Autodiscover is a really neat\nfunction that's built into Exchange.\n\n9\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.200\nIt was actually introduced\nseveral versions ago, but\n\n10\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.470\nit's gotten a little better with each\nversion of Exchange that's come out, and\n\n11\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.130\nwhat Autodiscover does is\nit allows your clients\n\n12\n00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.800\nto be able to launch Microsoft Outlook and\nhave it automatically configure itself to\n\n13\n00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.890\nconnect to your server without\nyou having to do anything.\n\n14\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.450\nNow back in the day when you fired\nup somebody's new computer for\n\n15\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.060\nthe first time you'd have\nto fire up Outlook and\n\n16\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.100\nyou'd have to put in the server name,\nthe username, the password.\n\n17\n00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.270\nYou'd have to know the ports\nto connect on the server.\n\n18\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.710\nYou'd have to know a lot of information\nthat an average end user doesn't know.\n\n19\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.810\nSo just getting connected to e-mail in the\nfirst place usually required the help of,\n\n20\n00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.620\nwell, the support team, right?\n\n21\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.020\nYour desktop engineers,\nyour help desk techs, or\n\n22\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.060\nwhoever to get people connected, but with\nAutodiscover you don't need that anymore.\n\n23\n00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.460\nNow people just launch Outlook and\nit magically finds your server, finds your\n\n24\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.980\nsettings, gets everything configured in\nyour email, and you didn't have to have\n\n25\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.600\nany intimate knowledge of the background\ninfrastructure or anything like that.\n\n26\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.260\nAnd that's really, really useful.\n\n27\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.890\nAll right, now the reason I say\nAutodiscover is mysterious is that for\n\n28\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.510\nmost of us we don't have to configure it.\n\n29\n00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.570\nIt just works.\n\n30\n00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.345\nYou install Exchange, and\nall of a sudden your system auto detects.\n\n31\n00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:41.280\nAnd that's true for\nyour local area network.\n\n32\n00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.905\nFor machines on your own network,\n\n33\n00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:44.300\nAutodiscover will work\nright out of the box.\n\n34\n00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.430\nYou really don't have to tweak anything.\n\n35\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.520\nBut if you've got users that are\nconnecting from home, from outside of your\n\n36\n00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.850\nnetwork, if they're out their on the WAM\non the Internet somewhere, that's not so\n\n37\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.615\nautomatic anymore.\n\n38\n00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:55.820\nIt's not so magic.\n\n39\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.820\nNow we have to get a bit involved.\n\n40\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.740\nAnd so in this episode we're gonna\ntake a look at how AutoDiscover works.\n\n41\n00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.020\nHow the nice,\neasy automatic stuff works, and\n\n42\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.040\nthen the tweaks that we need to do to get\nit working for our external users also so\n\n43\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.590\nwe can have full Autodiscover\nfunctionality everywhere out there.\n\n44\n00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.220\nSo that's basically what we're\ngonna be taking a look at.\n\n45\n00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.710\nLet's dive in and see this.\n\n46\n00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.750\nWell first off I want to give you guys\nan example of Autodiscover working\n\n47\n00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.970\njust out of the box, right?\n\n48\n00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.770\nSo here on my computer I've got my\nexchange environment pulled up and\n\n49\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.410\nthis is a pretty basic environment.\n\n50\n00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.870\nI've got two servers.\n\n51\n00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.832\nI've got one client access server and\none mailbox server.\n\n52\n00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:33.140\nNow Autodiscover, as a function,\nruns from your client access servers.\n\n53\n00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.310\nSo every client access\nserver that you build up\n\n54\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.840\nis technically an Autodiscover server,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.340\nWhat they do is they create what's called\nan SCP, or a service control point, and\n\n56\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.540\nthat service control, oh sorry,\nservice connection point, there we go.\n\n57\n00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.890\nThat service connection point,\nthat's where your computers boot up,\n\n58\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.040\nthey look for a service and\nwhere they can connect to it, and\n\n59\n00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.080\nthe service connection point is that.\n\n60\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.520\nEvery client access server you have\nis a valid SCP for Autodiscover.\n\n61\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.060\nWe might just have to tweak that a bit.\n\n62\n00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.170\nThat doesn't mean you use all of your\nclient access servers for this, especially\n\n63\n00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.210\nif it's external users that means this\nis a server that might be exposed to\n\n64\n00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.490\nthe internet, and you typically don't\nwant to do that with too many servers.\n\n65\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.270\nSo you may only have one or two client\naccess servers that you use as an SCP,\n\n66\n00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.622\nand the other ones just sit there and\nidle.\n\n67\n00:03:16.622 --> 00:03:17.530\nAll right?\n\n68\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.125\nBut basically this client access\nserver right here is already\n\n69\n00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:24.545\nacting as an Autodiscover and\nI know that because if I take a user and\n\n70\n00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:26.395\nlog into a machine for the first time.\n\n71\n00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:29.405\nHere, I'll take this machine and\nlet me switch users.\n\n72\n00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:31.725\nI'm gonna log in as a user I\nhaven't logged in as before.\n\n73\n00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:34.855\nI'm gonna log in as John Doe, and so\n\n74\n00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:39.650\nI've got this Jdoe account and\nI'll get logged in as him.\n\n75\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.520\nAnd he's never logged in\non this computer before, so\n\n76\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.390\nWindows is gonna create\nan all new profile.\n\n77\n00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.480\nSo see how it says preparing\nyour desktop right there?\n\n78\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.210\nHe's getting an all new profile.\n\n79\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.450\nSo when I launch Outlook, it'll be the\nfirst time this user has launched Outlook,\n\n80\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.000\nand it's gonna create a new\nprofile in Outlook and\n\n81\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.920\nthen it's gonna ask to find his server.\n\n82\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.840\nNow in the old day, he'd need to break\nout his notes that says all right,\n\n83\n00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.300\nhere's the server name, here's the port,\nhere's this, here's that, but\n\n84\n00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.360\nwith Autodiscover,\nthat system happens much more easily.\n\n85\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.080\nSo I'm going to fire up outlook, and its\ngoing to ask some really simple questions.\n\n86\n00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.200\nIts going to ask what's your name and\nwhat's your e-mail address, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.672\nSo as I move forward on my wizard here,\n\n88\n00:04:17.672 --> 00:04:19.940\nit's gonna ask if I want to\nset up an e-mail account, and\n\n89\n00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.540\nthen it's gonna ask for\nmy name and my e-mail address.\n\n90\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.980\nAnd do you see what it just did?\n\n91\n00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.400\nSee how it auto filled that in?\n\n92\n00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.030\nOn you local area network, your computer's\njoined to the Active Directory.\n\n93\n00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.330\nRight?\nThis computer is joined to my domain.\n\n94\n00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.210\nWell, where's all my exchange\nconfiguration stored?\n\n95\n00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.000\nIt's stored in the Active Directory also.\n\n96\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.320\nSo, your computer can look right\nat the active directory and\n\n97\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.480\nsee that you have a mailbox to\nsee what your e-mail address is.\n\n98\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.350\nSo, John doesn't even have to type that\ndata in, it fills it in for him, and\n\n99\n00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.640\nthen when he hits next, it's gonna reach\nout to the server and there it goes\n\n100\n00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.720\nestablishing a network connection,\nsearching for jdoe@itprotv.net settings.\n\n101\n00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.150\nNow it's doing Autodiscover.\n\n102\n00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.910\nIt's trying to find those settings and\n\n103\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.990\nonce it finds them, then it'll log in and\nit'll be in his email.\n\n104\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.780\nNow normally, it finishes already.\n\n105\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.880\nIt'd be done and\nwe'd be into Outlook already.\n\n106\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.440\nBut there's a little problem that you're\ngoing to have with a default install of\n\n107\n00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.900\nexchanges going on right now, and\nit has to do with certificates.\n\n108\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.820\nIn order for\nAutodiscover to properly work,\n\n109\n00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.150\nwe have to have a valid\ncertificate on our server.\n\n110\n00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.620\nNow when you install exchange, when\nyou install that client access server,\n\n111\n00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.710\nit creates its own self sign certificate.\n\n112\n00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.360\nNow do I trust that certificate?\n\n113\n00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.410\nNot by default.\n\n114\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.240\nSo the reason this is stalling\nright here is that I'm waiting for\n\n115\n00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.270\nthat certificate and\neventually I'll get a little pop-up and\n\n116\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.930\nit'll say do you wanna trust this and\nI'll have that choice, right?\n\n117\n00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.630\nBut what I can do to kinda usher\nthat a long is one of two things.\n\n118\n00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.921\nOne, I can go out and buy a legitimate\ncertificate from Digiserv,\n\n119\n00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:51.170\nVerisign, Thought,\nsomebody like that, right.\n\n120\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.290\nYou go out and you buy a certificate\nfrom one of those big public vendors.\n\n121\n00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.940\nYou put that on your server and now your\nclients automatically trust it, right.\n\n122\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.110\nThat works for small businesses,\neven some medium businesses.\n\n123\n00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.230\nBut for large organizations,\n\n124\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.220\nyou probably don't wanna be\nbuying tons of certificates.\n\n125\n00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.190\nSo, you might choose to build your\nown certificate infrastructure.\n\n126\n00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.070\nIf you set up your own PKI,\nyour own public key infrastructure,\n\n127\n00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.410\nyou can generate as many certs as you\nneed and you don't have to pay for them.\n\n128\n00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.420\nThey're your own, and\n\n129\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.710\nmachines that are joined to your\ndomain will automatically trust those.\n\n130\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.550\nBut mine's not going to trust it\nbecause I'm joined to a domain,\n\n131\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.990\nbut I don't have a true\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n132\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.620\nI'm using Exchange's built in cert.\n\n133\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.160\nSo I'm gonna cancel this.\n\n134\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.400\nSo we'll just cancel right\nout of that wizard, and\n\n135\n00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.770\nI want to trust the certificate\nof my client access server.\n\n136\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.910\nSo, to do that quickly and easily, you can\njust fire it up and just browse to OWA.\n\n137\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.400\nAnd when I browse to the server I'm gonna\nsee that it is a secure connection,\n\n138\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.870\nright, so when I browse to\nlab-cas01/owa it's a secure connection,\n\n139\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.630\nbut see the warning that I get?\n\n140\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.710\nIt's telling me that certificate's not\ntrusted, and so I can go ahead and\n\n141\n00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.570\ncontinue, but now I'm continuing\nwith an untrusted certificate.\n\n142\n00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.940\nAnd I want to trust it.\n\n143\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.410\nSo, if I want to trust it,\nI can just click on that, and\n\n144\n00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.380\nI can choose view certificates,\nand here's the certificate.\n\n145\n00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.890\nAnd what I want to do, is I basically\nwant to add this to my trusted route.\n\n146\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.930\nAnd I am doing this because\nI trust this server,\n\n147\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.220\nI know it, but, in a real production\nenvironment, I'd probably go out and\n\n148\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.170\nbuy a certificate and replace this, and\nI'll show you how to do that in a moment.\n\n149\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.980\nBut, for right now, I'm gonna go ahead and\ninstall the certificate.\n\n150\n00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.460\nAnd I'm going to place that\ninto my trusted routes.\n\n151\n00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.750\nSo I'm just going to throw\nit right in there so\n\n152\n00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.230\nthat I'll trust that certificate,\nand I'll have it.\n\n153\n00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.410\nThere's my confirmation that it's loaded.\n\n154\n00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.270\nAll right.\n\n155\n00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.070\nAnd now if I close that window down,\nlet me just take this,\n\n156\n00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.510\nand we'll close out of it, and\nI'm gonna browse to it again.\n\n157\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.160\nAnd this time when I browse\nto it what we should see\n\n158\n00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.030\nis that I didn't get a certificate prompt,\nright?\n\n159\n00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.200\nIt's trusting the certificate this time.\n\n160\n00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.663\nAnd if I fire up my Outlook,\n\n161\n00:07:51.663 --> 00:07:56.073\nnow when it goes to autoconfigure it's\ngonna work a lot better for me, all right?\n\n162\n00:07:56.073 --> 00:07:58.945\nSo one of the key steps to getting\nAutodiscover to work properly is having\n\n163\n00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:02.160\nyour certificates squared away, so we're\ngonna have to get that taken care of.\n\n164\n00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.366\nBut now it's gonna find his settings,\nand it's gonna reach out, and\n\n165\n00:08:05.366 --> 00:08:08.170\nit's gonna try and\ndiscover that from the server.\n\n166\n00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.190\nNow the discovery process,\nit actually goes through a couple of\n\n167\n00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.780\ndifferent steps to try and\nfind the server.\n\n168\n00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.220\nStep one, well it looks to\nthe active directory, right?\n\n169\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.670\nAnd so mine just did that look to\nthe active directory, found my settings,\n\n170\n00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.050\nthat's what's gonna happen\non your local area network.\n\n171\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.670\nBut if you're not on a local area network,\nstep two, it looks to DNS.\n\n172\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.440\nIt looks to DNS to find\nan auto discover record to\n\n173\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.590\ntell it where to find the server.\n\n174\n00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.650\nNow mine didn't do that cuz\nI'm on a local network, but\n\n175\n00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.530\nif I'm on an external server\nit's going to have to do that.\n\n176\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.340\nSo here I see it,\nit just moved through this and it's fine.\n\n177\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.730\nThere is a step three.\n\n178\n00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.600\nSo, first it does look\nto the active directory.\n\n179\n00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.570\nSecond, it looks to DNS.\n\n180\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.650\nThird, it looks for\na special SRV record in DNS.\n\n181\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.660\nNow that's separate from step two because\nnot every server has SRV records,\n\n182\n00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.770\nthey're not all supported, so\nthat's kind of like a last ditch effort\n\n183\n00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.570\nbefore it finally gives up and\nauto discover fails.\n\n184\n00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.910\nIf auto discover fails, then users get\ntheir entry field where they can punch in\n\n185\n00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.770\nthe server name, their username,\nthey can punch in all that data and\n\n186\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.460\ndo it manually, but\nthey'd have to know that data.\n\n187\n00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.840\nSo here, it's automatically configured.\n\n188\n00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.410\nIf I finish that,\nnow Outlook is gonna launch.\n\n189\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.659\nAnd if I'm John Doe and I just sat down\nhere, I didn't have to give it a username.\n\n190\n00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:19.750\nI didn't have to give it an email address,\nit filled that in.\n\n191\n00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.793\nI didn't have to tell the server,\nit found that.\n\n192\n00:09:21.793 --> 00:09:26.140\nAnd my email is configured and here I am.\n\n193\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.870\nI'm in it, and I'm working, right?\n\n194\n00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.530\nThe end-user didn't have to\nknow any information at all.\n\n195\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.130\nAll they had to know was\nto launch Outlook, right?\n\n196\n00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.430\nThat's what auto discover does.\n\n197\n00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.560\nThat's the real power of it, all right?\n\n198\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.110\nBut as you saw with the certificate,\nthere is a little bit of work\n\n199\n00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.130\nwe as administrators have to do\nto get this working properly and\n\n200\n00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.480\nto get it running smoothly.\n\n201\n00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.390\nSo here, I'm in my mailbox and\nthat's great, all right?\n\n202\n00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.920\nWell, let's take a look at a few\nthings we can do to kind of get this\n\n203\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.730\nrunning a little more smoothly, all right?\n\n204\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.020\nI mentioned certificates.\n\n205\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.890\nCertificates are probably the big part,\nbecause when you have somebody connecting\n\n206\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:05.200\ninternally, they're likely connecting with\nan internal name like lab-cas01, right?\n\n207\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.060\nThat's the internal server name.\n\n208\n00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.601\nBut if they're external, they're\nconnecting with a different name, right?\n\n209\n00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:12.469\nAnd so now you're gonna have\nyour certificate fail because\n\n210\n00:10:12.469 --> 00:10:13.224\nof the different name.\n\n211\n00:10:13.224 --> 00:10:14.663\nSo that's something we're\ngonna have to deal with.\n\n212\n00:10:14.663 --> 00:10:17.123\nAnd then just where the certificate\nis issued from in the first place.\n\n213\n00:10:17.123 --> 00:10:21.141\nSo, at a minimum,\nwe're gonna need to fix our certificate.\n\n214\n00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:24.103\nAt a maximum though, we're gonna need to\ndo some DNS work to kind of get things\n\n215\n00:10:24.103 --> 00:10:26.121\nsquared away and\nget everything working properly.\n\n216\n00:10:26.121 --> 00:10:29.117\nSo let's kind of jump through the hoops\nthere and see that in action.\n\n217\n00:10:29.117 --> 00:10:33.704\nAll right, I'm gonna jump back\nover to my admin account and\n\n218\n00:10:33.704 --> 00:10:38.790\nI'm gonna go into my Exchange\nadministration center.\n\n219\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.675\nAnd in there we'll be able\nto tweak our certificates\n\n220\n00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:44.085\nto get everything set the way\nthat we need it, all right?\n\n221\n00:10:44.085 --> 00:10:46.925\nWhen you go into the EAC,\nif you look down the left side,\n\n222\n00:10:46.925 --> 00:10:49.305\nyou'll see a bunch of stuff,\nlike our servers.\n\n223\n00:10:49.305 --> 00:10:53.220\nAnd then in the server section,\nyou'll see certificates, all right?\n\n224\n00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.870\nHere's where it keeps your certificates,\nand when we view it this way we can\n\n225\n00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.970\nactually see the certificates for\nall of our Exchange servers.\n\n226\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.300\nAnd every Exchange server's important, but\n\n227\n00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.790\nthe client access server's\nthe one I'm worried about.\n\n228\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.760\nSo what you'll wanna do is hit this\ndrop-down box and make sure you choose\n\n229\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.570\nthe client access server that you want\nyour clients to be connecting to,\n\n230\n00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.150\nall right?\n\n231\n00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.732\nFrom here, you can see all\nthe certificates that are attached, and\n\n232\n00:11:13.732 --> 00:11:15.461\nyou're gonna see more than one, all right?\n\n233\n00:11:15.461 --> 00:11:16.337\nFor example,\n\n234\n00:11:16.337 --> 00:11:20.644\nwe got this Microsoft Exchange\nServer Authentication Certificate,\n\n235\n00:11:20.644 --> 00:11:22.765\nMicrosoft Exchange, and WMSVC.\n\n236\n00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:23.843\nAll right, what are these?\n\n237\n00:11:23.843 --> 00:11:27.048\nWell the first one, that's used for\nExchange server authentication.\n\n238\n00:11:27.048 --> 00:11:29.377\nWhen two Exchange servers\ntalk to each other,\n\n239\n00:11:29.377 --> 00:11:33.746\nlike when they're doing internal send and\nreceive connectors, they authenticate.\n\n240\n00:11:33.746 --> 00:11:35.523\nAnd they authenticate\nusing these certificates.\n\n241\n00:11:35.523 --> 00:11:38.366\nAnd so that's what that one is for and\nwe typically don't mess with that one,\n\n242\n00:11:38.366 --> 00:11:39.482\nyou normally leave it alone.\n\n243\n00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:41.797\nThe second one, Microsoft Exchange,\n\n244\n00:11:41.797 --> 00:11:46.846\nthat's the one that Outlook WebApp is\nusing, that's the one that POP3 and IMAP4,\n\n245\n00:11:46.846 --> 00:11:51.641\nthat's the one all of our other services\nare using, that's the important one.\n\n246\n00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:54.571\nAnd then, the last one is\nthe Windows ManagementSservice, so\n\n247\n00:11:54.571 --> 00:11:57.834\nwhen you're opening a remote\nPowerShell session it encrypts that and\n\n248\n00:11:57.834 --> 00:12:00.450\nuses a certificate,\nthat's the one it uses.\n\n249\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.750\nNow, if you can't remember which is which,\nthey make it kind of easy for you,\n\n250\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.580\ncuz you'll see here on the right side\nwhere it's got assigned to services.\n\n251\n00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.180\nIt's telling you what services that\ncertificate is being used for, and\n\n252\n00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.420\nI can see this one's not being used for\nanything, right?\n\n253\n00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.170\nThat's not true.\n\n254\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.790\nIt's not being used for anything in\nExchange, it's being used in PowerShell.\n\n255\n00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.470\nSo we don't see PowerShell settings here,\nwe just see Exchange settings here.\n\n256\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.759\nAnd if go up to Server Authentication,\nI can see assigned to services SMTP,\n\n257\n00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:29.578\nbecause the send and\nreceive connectors in-between each server,\n\n258\n00:12:29.578 --> 00:12:33.074\nwhat the HUB transport rolls are doing,\nis all done via SMTP.\n\n259\n00:12:33.074 --> 00:12:37.968\nBut if I look at Microsoft Exchange,\nthis one says, IMAP, POP, IIS,\n\n260\n00:12:37.968 --> 00:12:40.758\nand SMTP, it says everything, right?\n\n261\n00:12:40.758 --> 00:12:42.152\nThis is the important certificate.\n\n262\n00:12:42.152 --> 00:12:44.620\nSo it's real easy to spot\nthe one that's truly important.\n\n263\n00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.450\nAnd IIS,\nthat's the Internet information server.\n\n264\n00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:51.160\nThat's the web server built into Windows\nServer 2012, so that's the one that's\n\n265\n00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.260\ndoing Outlook WebApp, and auto discover\nis using the web service also.\n\n266\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.720\nSo this is the important certificate.\n\n267\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.880\nThis is the one that I care about.\n\n268\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.770\nAnd if you look at it you'll see this\nis a self-signed certificate, and\n\n269\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.530\nthe issuer is my server, lab-cass01.\n\n270\n00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.045\nWhen you install your client access\nserver, you'll see the same thing, right?\n\n271\n00:13:10.045 --> 00:13:12.330\nWell, it'll be your server name,\nthat'll be different, but\n\n272\n00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.110\nyou'll have that self-signed certificate.\n\n273\n00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.380\nAnd so the certificate error\nthat I saw a moment ago?\n\n274\n00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.350\nWell, it wasn't so much an error,\njust the things took too long.\n\n275\n00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.120\nThat error, that's caused by\nthe self-signed certificate.\n\n276\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.950\nSo, you got two choices.\n\n277\n00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.470\nOne, trust the self-signed certificate.\n\n278\n00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.030\nThat's what I did a second ago.\n\n279\n00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:33.610\nOr two, issue a new certificate and\nuse it instead, right?\n\n280\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.250\nAnd you can see we've got a nice little\nplus sign up here you can hit to issue\n\n281\n00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.540\na new certificate.\n\n282\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.895\nNow I could create a new\nself signed certificate, but\n\n283\n00:13:40.895 --> 00:13:42.650\nthere's not really a whole\nlot of point in that.\n\n284\n00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.410\nMaybe you just don't trust\nthe certificate that Microsoft issued so\n\n285\n00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.740\nyou wanna issue your own.\n\n286\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.710\nMaybe the one that was there got\ncompromised and so you wanna do a new one.\n\n287\n00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.507\nThose would be reasons you might do\na self-signed cert, but otherwise you're\n\n288\n00:13:53.507 --> 00:13:57.092\ngonna create a request for a certificate\nfrom a certification authority.\n\n289\n00:13:57.092 --> 00:14:01.053\nNow that CA,\nit might be a public one, right?\n\n290\n00:14:01.053 --> 00:14:03.094\nI mentioned like DigiCert or\nVerisign, those guys.\n\n291\n00:14:03.094 --> 00:14:05.870\nYou can go and buy a certificate\nfrom them, it works great and\n\n292\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.465\nit has the added benefit of knowing that\nall of your clients are gonna trust it,\n\n293\n00:14:09.465 --> 00:14:11.939\nwhether they're joined your domain or\nnot, right?\n\n294\n00:14:11.939 --> 00:14:15.133\nOr, this CA could be one of your own,\nright?\n\n295\n00:14:15.133 --> 00:14:19.229\nYou could take any domain controller and\nadd the active directory certificates\n\n296\n00:14:19.229 --> 00:14:22.296\nservices to it and\nturn it into a certification authority.\n\n297\n00:14:22.296 --> 00:14:24.540\nYou could start issuing your own certs.\n\n298\n00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.310\nOn a positive side you could issue\ncerts without paying for them, right?\n\n299\n00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.450\nIt's your own.\n\n300\n00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.170\nOn a negative side, only computers\njoined to your domain will trust it.\n\n301\n00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.410\nComputers that are not joined to your\ndomain aren't going to trust it and\n\n302\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:41.550\nso you'll have to go to them and manually\nmake them trust your route authority.\n\n303\n00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.118\nAnd so, there's a little bit\nof extra work to do there.\n\n304\n00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:45.478\nBut normally, we're gonna buy one.\n\n305\n00:14:45.478 --> 00:14:47.793\nAnd the reason I say we're\ngonna buy one is because,\n\n306\n00:14:47.793 --> 00:14:49.483\nwhose gonna connect to your Outlook?\n\n307\n00:14:49.483 --> 00:14:52.141\nWell, you might have people\non mobile phones, right?\n\n308\n00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:53.998\nThis is the age of bring your own device,\nright?\n\n309\n00:14:53.998 --> 00:14:56.900\nSo you might have people on mobile phones,\niPads.\n\n310\n00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.875\nThey might have their own tablets,\nthere own desktops, there own laptops that\n\n311\n00:15:00.875 --> 00:15:05.815\nare not computers that you control and\nthey just wanna be able to login to OWA.\n\n312\n00:15:05.815 --> 00:15:09.225\nOr they just wanna be able to fire up\ntheir Outlook client and connect securely.\n\n313\n00:15:09.225 --> 00:15:12.355\nAnd since we don't have control of that\ndevice, we can't make it trust our\n\n314\n00:15:12.355 --> 00:15:16.935\ncertificate, and as a result it's better\noff for us to just go and buy one, right?\n\n315\n00:15:16.935 --> 00:15:18.255\nNow be careful,\n\n316\n00:15:18.255 --> 00:15:23.470\nwhen you buy a certificate because your\nserver has more than one name, right?\n\n317\n00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.331\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n318\n00:15:24.331 --> 00:15:28.453\nIf I go to create this request, and I hit\nNext, it's gonna ask for a friendly name.\n\n319\n00:15:28.453 --> 00:15:29.928\nAnd the friendly name is\nwhatever you want, right?\n\n320\n00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:33.459\nYou could call the certificate\nBob if you wanted to, but\n\n321\n00:15:33.459 --> 00:15:36.480\nI'll call this one my\nPublic ISS Certificate.\n\n322\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.240\nOr some kind of name that let's us\nremember what its purpose is, right,\n\n323\n00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.320\nwhy we got that certificate.\n\n324\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.460\nAnd then, it's gonna ask if I want\nto do a wild card certificate.\n\n325\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.060\nNow, wild card certificates are when\nwe do when we don't have a true server\n\n326\n00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:49.609\nname in there.\n\n327\n00:15:49.609 --> 00:15:54.572\nSo, instead of having\nlab/casso1.itprotv.net I might\n\n328\n00:15:54.572 --> 00:15:56.914\nhave star.itprotv.net.\n\n329\n00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:59.982\nNow, wild cards certificates\nare nice cuz you can use them for\n\n330\n00:15:59.982 --> 00:16:02.873\nmore than one name But\nif the certificate is compromised,\n\n331\n00:16:02.873 --> 00:16:05.823\nit's now been compromised\nacross more than one system, so\n\n332\n00:16:05.823 --> 00:16:09.350\nwhile we have that possibility\nwe don't normally do it, right.\n\n333\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:13.290\nSo on our next page we'll see where we\ncan start to pick other options and\n\n334\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.990\nget a little more specific.\n\n335\n00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.460\nIt's asking where I want to\nstore my certificate request.\n\n336\n00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.610\nWe'll normally just put that on our\nclient access server or on our desktop,\n\n337\n00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.940\nsomewhere like that so\nwe can save that request.\n\n338\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.450\nI'll store it on the cast server.\n\n339\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.790\nAnd then it's gonna ask for\nsome additional information, right?\n\n340\n00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.090\nWhat am I gonna use it for?\n\n341\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.810\nAnd when you look at this screen,\n\n342\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.500\nhere's where we start to see the multiple\nnames our server might have, right?\n\n343\n00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.300\nLooking at this, on the left side\nI've got a list of services.\n\n344\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.000\nAnd on the right side I've got\nthe domain name attached to them.\n\n345\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.980\nAnd you'll see like Outlook Web App\nis listed twice, right?\n\n346\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.580\nWhy twice?\n\n347\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.760\nWell, one is when accessed from\nthe Intranet, my LAN clients.\n\n348\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.530\nAnd the other is when accessed\nfrom the Internet, right?\n\n349\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.620\nFrom the WAN clients.\n\n350\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.700\nAnd when people connect they might\nconnect with different names and\n\n351\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.060\nso here is where we have\nto square that away.\n\n352\n00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.560\nFor example, I might want my LAN clients\nto connect to a server called lab-cas01,\n\n353\n00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.590\njust a single name.\n\n354\n00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:12.400\nRight?\n\n355\n00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.140\nOr maybe it is lab dash cas01-itprotv.net.\n\n356\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.930\nAll right, but then on the WAN,\non the internet side,\n\n357\n00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.640\nI want that server to be\ncalled something different.\n\n358\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.020\nI want it to be called\nmail at itprotv.net.\n\n359\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.205\nDifferent names.\n\n360\n00:17:28.205 --> 00:17:30.215\nAnd that's very common to have that.\n\n361\n00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.465\nOne set of names internally.\n\n362\n00:17:31.465 --> 00:17:33.115\nA different set of names externally.\n\n363\n00:17:33.115 --> 00:17:34.775\nOr some kind of shared name,\n\n364\n00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:37.555\nif we're doing like load-balancing\nservices or whatever.\n\n365\n00:17:37.555 --> 00:17:40.605\nThere might be a shared name that we're\nusing instead of this particular server.\n\n366\n00:17:40.605 --> 00:17:45.215\nSo, we can go through and edit these to\nspecify what we want that name to be for\n\n367\n00:17:45.215 --> 00:17:46.540\nour clients to connect.\n\n368\n00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.100\nAll right.\n\n369\n00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.350\nNow you can use the same name for\neverything.\n\n370\n00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.380\nI could just take this one name and copy\nand paste it across all these guys, and\n\n371\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.370\nthen it's gonna be the same\neverywhere across the board, right?\n\n372\n00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.020\nAnd the advantage of doing\nit that way is internal or\n\n373\n00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.520\nexternal clients are always\nset the same way.\n\n374\n00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.610\nWe just have to make sure that name can\nresolve internally and externally, right?\n\n375\n00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.710\nI need to be able to do this DNS look up\nfrom my internal network as well as my\n\n376\n00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.550\nexternal network.\n\n377\n00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.150\nAnd I'm manually putting them in here.\n\n378\n00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.170\nThis is a habit of mine.\n\n379\n00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.560\nI always do this manually.\n\n380\n00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.100\nIn reality if you leave the WAN one\nempty then it just uses the WAN one, so\n\n381\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.560\nit was actually already using this\nsetting, but I like to hard set it\n\n382\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.840\nanyway just so that I'm certain because\nthere can be some confusion and\n\n383\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.870\nit helps with troubleshooting later on.\n\n384\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:32.320\nBut also, you'll notice some differences\nlike this right here, Autodiscover.\n\n385\n00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.720\nWhen somebody does Autodiscover\nfrom the Internet,\n\n386\n00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.300\nthey're looking up\nAutoDiscover.itprotv.net, right?\n\n387\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.670\nA completely different name\nthan all the others, and\n\n388\n00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.600\nwe need to leave that be, right?\n\n389\n00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.710\nAutodiscover first off it\nlooks to the active directory.\n\n390\n00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.490\nIf it can't find the active directory,\nthen it looks for DNS.\n\n391\n00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.740\nAnd what it's looking for\nin DNS is a record.\n\n392\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.790\nAuto discover dot followed by\nwhatever your email domain name is.\n\n393\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:02.505\nSo if I say that my email is\njdoe@itprotv.net, it's gonna look for\n\n394\n00:19:02.505 --> 00:19:06.410\nautodiscover.itprotv.net that's why\nI've gotta have that entry in there.\n\n395\n00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.000\nSo I'm gonna leave that one be.\n\n396\n00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.960\nBut notice POP and\nIMAP it gave them internal names,\n\n397\n00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.260\nthat's not terribly useful.\n\n398\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.520\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and change those so\n\n399\n00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.029\nthat they're mapped to that\npublicly resolvable name.\n\n400\n00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.530\nSo now we'll get that nice and\nsquared down the list.\n\n401\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.030\nAnd I'll do the same\nwith Outlook anywhere.\n\n402\n00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.960\nAnd now we've got that same consistent\nname being used across the board.\n\n403\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.070\nOn my next screen, now it's gonna\nshow me about my certificate.\n\n404\n00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.720\nNotice how the certificate\nhas more than one name.\n\n405\n00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.730\nIn the old days when you\nbought an SSL certificate,\n\n406\n00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:45.090\nit just had one name www.itprotv.net or\nsomething like that.\n\n407\n00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.890\nBut this server has more than one name.\n\n408\n00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:53.170\nIt has lab-cas01.itprotv.net and\nit's got autodiscover.itprotv.net.\n\n409\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.760\nAnd, technically, it's not showing\nup here, but I'm gonna add it.\n\n410\n00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.790\nIt's got lab-cas01 by\nitself with no domain.\n\n411\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:59.370\nRight?\nSo\n\n412\n00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.470\nthese are all different\nnames this one server has.\n\n413\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.010\nWell, if I buy a certificate with\none domain and somebody connects on\n\n414\n00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.280\na different domain, they're going to get a\ncertificate error, and we don't want that.\n\n415\n00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.750\nAuto discover does not\nlike certificate errors.\n\n416\n00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.130\nWe've got to make sure our\ncertificates are on the up and up.\n\n417\n00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.390\nFortunately, almost every\ncertification vendor our there\n\n418\n00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:22.550\nsupports what are called subject\nalternative names, sans.\n\n419\n00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.680\nSo when you buy a certificate,\n\n420\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.300\nit has one primary name,\nthat's the first one on the list.\n\n421\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.950\nAnd then all the others\nare alternative names.\n\n422\n00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.140\nOther names somebody might\nuse when they connect.\n\n423\n00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:36.780\nIt's important that your certificate has\nall of the names of your server listed\n\n424\n00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.130\nin order to avoid certificate errors,\nso I'm gonna add those in.\n\n425\n00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:44.200\nNow there is one more here itprotv.net,\nand that's because when\n\n426\n00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.390\nautodiscover does the lookup against the\nDNS, the first thing it actually looks for\n\n427\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.710\nis your domain,\nforward slash auto discover, right?\n\n428\n00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.440\nAnd that's assuming that you\nhave your root domain pointed at\n\n429\n00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.290\na client access server\nwhich almost nobody does.\n\n430\n00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.020\nSo, that really doesn't get hit.\n\n431\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.770\nAnd then it moves on to the next one\nwhich is autodiscover.itprotv,net and\n\n432\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.649\nthat's why it's got both\nof those entries in there.\n\n433\n00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.300\nAll right.\nSo I'm gonna leave that be and\n\n434\n00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.760\nI'll move forward on that and now we can\nstart to punch in the information for\n\n435\n00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.470\nour certificate to request it.\n\n436\n00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:19.670\nNow, when this is done, it's gonna\nbe doing the request against, well,\n\n437\n00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.630\na public server somewhere.\n\n438\n00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:26.110\nIt's gonna generate a CSR, a Certificate\nof Request and we can take that CSR and\n\n439\n00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.570\nsend it up to whoever it is we're\nbuying a certificate from and\n\n440\n00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.300\nthey'll sell you the certificate, and then\nyou come back here and you load it in.\n\n441\n00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.580\nThat's the process, and if you've watched\nour server episodes where we show\n\n442\n00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.390\nsetting up a public key infrastructure,\nyou guys have seen that before,\n\n443\n00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:41.810\nbut that's the basic process of\ngetting that certificate in.\n\n444\n00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.790\nSo here we just finish filling this\nout and then we go and pay some money.\n\n445\n00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.370\nIf I'm using the self-signed certificate,\nthough, how do I edit this stuff?\n\n446\n00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.970\nWell, if we're doing\nthe self-sign certificate,\n\n447\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.650\nyou can actually modify that right up\nhere under our virtual directories.\n\n448\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.650\nIf you choose virtual directories,\n\n449\n00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.690\nyou'll see the web addresses that\nare being used for everything.\n\n450\n00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.040\nFor Outlook web app, for\n\n451\n00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.520\nthe Exchange control panel,\nnow the exchange administration center.\n\n452\n00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.700\nYou'll see ActiveSync,\nthe offline address book,\n\n453\n00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.980\nall these different things right here.\n\n454\n00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.600\nAnd if you click\nthe little wrench up here,\n\n455\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.130\nthis will let you configure those\nexternal client access domain names.\n\n456\n00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:18.780\nAnd so we can say,\n\n457\n00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.580\nwhen somebody connects, here's the address\nthey're gonna be connecting to.\n\n458\n00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.630\nAnd it says right here,\n\n459\n00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.030\nselect the client access servers\nthat people will be connecting to.\n\n460\n00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.040\nAnd what the external domain is.\n\n461\n00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.470\nSo this is kinda the counterpart\nto the certificate.\n\n462\n00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:35.360\nWe've gotta fill this out too so\nthat our servers know to listen.\n\n463\n00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.120\nI might have ten different\nclient access servers.\n\n464\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.340\nBut I only want two of them to\nbe connected to the Internet.\n\n465\n00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.090\nAnd so I would come in here and hit the +\nsign and just add the two that I wanted.\n\n466\n00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.160\nNow I've only got one so I'll add that in.\n\n467\n00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.670\nBut, if I had ten, I would just\npick the two that I wanted, and\n\n468\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.160\nadd them to that list, and then here\nI would give them the public name.\n\n469\n00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.890\nNow, if I have two client access servers,\nI might be load balancing across them, so\n\n470\n00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.780\nI'll have one shared name between them.\n\n471\n00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.360\nI've only got one, though, so\n\n472\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:05.450\nI can put in the individual name of\nthat server, and there we've got it set.\n\n473\n00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.040\nAnd now it's gonna tie that in, and now my\nsystem will now when somebody connects,\n\n474\n00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.390\nthis is the name they're connecting to.\n\n475\n00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:16.280\nMy certificate should match that,\nit should have that name attached to it.\n\n476\n00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.080\nAnd if it doesn't,\nwell we'll need to go and correct that.\n\n477\n00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.240\nSo I'm gonna give that a moment\nwhile it updates that.\n\n478\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.490\nNow, what's it doing in the background.\n\n479\n00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.540\nIn the background, it's reaching\nout to the Client Access Server and\n\n480\n00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.110\nit's reaching out to the Active Directory.\n\n481\n00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.960\nAnd it's populating the fields\nwith that domain name to say\n\n482\n00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.570\nhere's the new name that we're gonna\nuse when people connect externally.\n\n483\n00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.530\nAnd now when Auto Discover runs,\n\n484\n00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.930\nthat's the name that they're gonna\nlearn when they try and connect.\n\n485\n00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.770\nSo we'll give that a moment\nwhile it turns alarm.\n\n486\n00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.920\nNow after that's done,\nif I used a self signed cert,\n\n487\n00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.950\nI'll need to make sure it's\ngot the right names in it.\n\n488\n00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.030\nIt should.\n\n489\n00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.270\nWe can actually cheat a little bit\ndouble check this while that's running.\n\n490\n00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.900\nIf I come back here and take a look\nat the certificate that I've got, oh,\n\n491\n00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.490\nit just finished.\n\n492\n00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.420\nSo I'll close that out.\n\n493\n00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.555\nthere we go.\nWe can take a look at the certificate I\n\n494\n00:23:58.555 --> 00:24:02.839\nhad issued before and if we edit that one,\nthis is the self-signed certificate it\n\n495\n00:24:02.839 --> 00:24:06.707\nhad installed and I can see that it\ndoes have lab/casso.itprotv.net.\n\n496\n00:24:06.707 --> 00:24:10.250\nBut, shoot, I thought I was going to\nbe able to use this certificate, but\n\n497\n00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.320\nI'm missing something aren't I?\n\n498\n00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.970\nI'm missing autodiscover that itprotv.net.\n\n499\n00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.160\nSo, I actually can't use my\nself-assigned certificate,\n\n500\n00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.030\nso I'm going to have some problems there.\n\n501\n00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:22.800\nSo, what I need to do is issue a new\nself-assigned certificate to fix that\n\n502\n00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.460\non my server.\n\n503\n00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.688\nSo, I'll do a new self-assigned cert,\n\n504\n00:24:25.688 --> 00:24:29.610\nwhich is really just about the same\nas issuing a true certificate.\n\n505\n00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.260\nThe only difference is that part where\nwe upload our request to a provider and\n\n506\n00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.560\npay for it, we don't do that.\n\n507\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.970\nInstead, our server just\nissues the certificate.\n\n508\n00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.230\nSo, I'll call this my,\nyou know, new self-signed cert.\n\n509\n00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.680\nAnd I'm gonna add in\n\n510\n00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.910\nthe server I'm attaching this\nto which is just LabCass 01.\n\n511\n00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.550\nAnd then I'm gonna have\nto update my names.\n\n512\n00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.700\nAnd see it remembered all the names\nfrom where I filled them out earlier.\n\n513\n00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.490\nSo it's got all that information in there.\n\n514\n00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.150\nActually, it didn't\nremember these last two.\n\n515\n00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.850\nSo let me update those.\n\n516\n00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.970\nI'm not using POP or IMAP anyway,\nso I'm not too worried about it.\n\n517\n00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.310\nBut still, it's best to have it correct\nbecause otherwise you'll have a problem\n\n518\n00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.430\ndown the road and\nyou won't remember where this was.\n\n519\n00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.450\nSo, we'll just go in and update that.\n\n520\n00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.320\nAnd then we'll be in good shape.\n\n521\n00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.140\nAll right, so once I've got that, it's\ngot the names, there's the server name.\n\n522\n00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.790\nAutodiscover is in there,\nthe domain name is in there.\n\n523\n00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.790\nI might go ahead and choose to add in the\nsingle name, just to be on the safe side.\n\n524\n00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:23.980\nEven though nobody should be using that.\n\n525\n00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.900\nI'll punch it in and\nthen I'll finish that up.\n\n526\n00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.080\nNow, if I were doing the other stiffy\nrequest, this would generate a request\n\n527\n00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.540\nthat I would upload, pay and\nthen download the response.\n\n528\n00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.470\nHere, since it's self signed, it just\nautomatically approves it and there it is.\n\n529\n00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.930\nThere's my new self signed cert.\n\n530\n00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.490\nBut if I look at the services down here,\n\n531\n00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.630\nsee how it's only attached to IMAP and\nPOP?\n\n532\n00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.950\nSo it's not attached everywhere yet.\n\n533\n00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.900\nSo I need to edit that.\n\n534\n00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.180\nAnd when I go into this I'll\nsee services on the left and\n\n535\n00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.910\nhere's where I can attach\nto everything else.\n\n536\n00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:58.800\nAnd I'm gonna attach it to to SMTP,\nIMAP, POP and ISS I'm not using unified\n\n537\n00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.850\nmessaging, but it wouldn't hurt to\ngo ahead and attach it to that also.\n\n538\n00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.130\nAnd now that's the certificate I'm\nusing across the board for this server.\n\n539\n00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:05.940\nAll right?\n\n540\n00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.260\nAnd let's see.\n\n541\n00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.690\nOh, it's warning me about unified\nmessaging cuz I'm not actually using it,\n\n542\n00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:10.475\nso I'll turn that off.\n\n543\n00:26:10.475 --> 00:26:11.460\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n544\n00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.080\nThat's what I get for\ntrying to be complete.\n\n545\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.700\nAll right, so\nit's asking me if I'm sure that I wanna\n\n546\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.010\noverride the existing certificate,\nand I am.\n\n547\n00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.660\nI'll override it.\n\n548\n00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.660\nAnd then we should be in business.\n\n549\n00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.770\nSo once that's done, there we go, now\nI've got the new certificate in place and\n\n550\n00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:29.710\nI should be ready to rock.\n\n551\n00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:34.010\nNow when somebody fires up Outlook and\ngoes to connect, Autodiscover's gonna run,\n\n552\n00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.590\nit's gonna see that cert and\nthat name and it's gonna move from there.\n\n553\n00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.350\nNow we already saw that, whoops,\n\n554\n00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.120\nwe already saw that with our user JDoe,\nright?\n\n555\n00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.920\nIf I switch back over to JDoe, or\n\n556\n00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.300\nJohn Doe,\nhe was the one who auto configured, right?\n\n557\n00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.540\nHe did auto discovery,\nhe found the server and he connected.\n\n558\n00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.690\nNow how do I actually know that worked?\n\n559\n00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:56.300\nIt's all hidden.\n\n560\n00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.530\nIt's all in the background, right?\n\n561\n00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:58.870\nSo how do we know what happened?\n\n562\n00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.920\nWell, there's actually a neat\nlittle feature that we can use\n\n563\n00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.870\nthat's a hidden feature.\n\n564\n00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.480\nSo, I wanna show you guys this one.\n\n565\n00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.860\nMy head's covering it up though.\n\n566\n00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.070\nCan we get my computer full screen for\na second?\n\n567\n00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:13.550\nSo down in the bottom right corner in\nour taskbar, we've got our clock and\n\n568\n00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.629\nour other little items.\n\n569\n00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.480\nAnd what you'll see down here is that\nOutlook actually has its own little system\n\n570\n00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.670\ntray icon.\n\n571\n00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.060\nAnd in that system tray,\n\n572\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.100\nif you right-click on it,\nyou've got some options, right?\n\n573\n00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.480\nAnd there's nothing too fancy in here.\n\n574\n00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.620\nBut if you hold down\ncontrol on your keyboard,\n\n575\n00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.560\nwhen you right-click you'll\nactually see some hidden options.\n\n576\n00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.360\nSo I'm gonna hold Control and\nright-click on that Outlook icon.\n\n577\n00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:43.910\nAnd notice how I've got connection status,\nand test email auto configuration.\n\n578\n00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:47.260\nThat is what's gonna let\nus see the auto discover.\n\n579\n00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.740\nSo when we click on that, it's gonna\nlaunch this window and here I can type in\n\n580\n00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.930\nanybody's email address, and we'll be\nable to see what's going on there.\n\n581\n00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:58.850\nSo, when I come in and I type in J Doe and\nI punch in his password,\n\n582\n00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:02.240\ncuz it's actually gonna try and connect,\nI could do my account and try mine.\n\n583\n00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.830\nWe can hit task and it's gonna test out\nauto discover and see if it's working.\n\n584\n00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:11.730\nAnd it's gonna give us detailed feedback,\nso that people can see what's going on and\n\n585\n00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:12.490\nget that information.\n\n586\n00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.920\nThis is normally hidden.\n\n587\n00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.800\nIt's all in the background.\n\n588\n00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.740\nWe don't see it.\n\n589\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.440\nThis is gonna test it out and\ngive us that information.\n\n590\n00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.080\nSo, if we give it just a second\nit's running through that process.\n\n591\n00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.160\nIt should be seeing our new certificate.\n\n592\n00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.340\nAnd it'll let us know if it's working or\nnot.\n\n593\n00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.310\nIf it fails, we know we need to\ntroubleshoot it and fortunately,\n\n594\n00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.490\nit'll give us information\nas to what to troubleshoot.\n\n595\n00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:35.130\nNow it's doing a lot more that\njust basic auto discover.\n\n596\n00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.000\nWhat it's doing is it's running\nthrough all of the different types of\n\n597\n00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.650\nauto discover.\n\n598\n00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.890\nIt's testing port connectivity seeing\nif it can reach out to the server.\n\n599\n00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:43.550\nIt's checking all of that.\n\n600\n00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.180\nSo that's why it's saying it may\ntake up to a minute we just have to\n\n601\n00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:46.790\ngive it some time.\n\n602\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.640\nAnd then when it's done we'll be\nable to see the log file output.\n\n603\n00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.250\nAnd you can actually look\nat some of it right now.\n\n604\n00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.770\nSee how it's reaching out?\n\n605\n00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:58.710\nAnd it's reaching out in my case to\nmail.itprotv.net for IMAP for some reason.\n\n606\n00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.270\nAnd then we'll see pop.itprotv.net,\n\n607\n00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.680\nand a few others as it's reaching out\ntrying to find these different servers.\n\n608\n00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.900\nAnd at the end of the day, this is\nthe one I'm looking for right here.\n\n609\n00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.150\nAttempting URL.\n\n610\n00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.000\nIt's looking for auto discover, and\n\n611\n00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.970\nsee how it looks for\nlab-caso1.itprotv.net/autodiscover.\n\n612\n00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:23.040\nIt's looking for that folder on my client\naccess server and it's connected to it and\n\n613\n00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.000\nthen it's gonna start\nresponding back with answers.\n\n614\n00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.030\nHere it's trying to connect via POP and\nIMAP, and these are all failing.\n\n615\n00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.320\nSee how these are all failed,\nfailed, failed failed failed?\n\n616\n00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.670\nWell, POP and\nIMAP are disabled in Exchange by default.\n\n617\n00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:39.760\nWhen we connect we need to either\nconnect via MAPI, the old way, or\n\n618\n00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.070\nby RCP over HTTP which is that new way.\n\n619\n00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.840\nAnd so I do expect to see failures, but\nI also expect to see some successes.\n\n620\n00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.700\nSMTP is succeeding.\n\n621\n00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.680\nWe are able to connect with SMTP.\n\n622\n00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.630\nAnd then we should be\nconnected to our mailbox also.\n\n623\n00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.990\nSo all this is kinda going on, where we\ncan see that information right here and\n\n624\n00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.890\nuse it for troubleshooting.\n\n625\n00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:04.265\nWell, what we've seen right here is\nthe basic functions of AutoDiscover.\n\n626\n00:30:04.265 --> 00:30:08.585\nDiscover and how it works out of\nthe box but there's a lot more to it.\n\n627\n00:30:08.585 --> 00:30:11.085\nWe still need to see how it\nlooks from the Internet, but\n\n628\n00:30:11.085 --> 00:30:13.505\nI'm kind of running a little\nshort on time on this episode.\n\n629\n00:30:13.505 --> 00:30:16.385\nSo we're gonna have to do a part two on\nthis to take a look at the Internet side\n\n630\n00:30:16.385 --> 00:30:18.895\nof getting connected to\nan auto discover server.\n\n631\n00:30:18.895 --> 00:30:21.545\nSo, in this episode,\nwe got a chance to see auto discover.\n\n632\n00:30:21.545 --> 00:30:23.735\nWe saw what it does, we say how it works.\n\n633\n00:30:23.735 --> 00:30:26.535\nWe talked about a little bit about\nthe certificate, and the issues we can run\n\n634\n00:30:26.535 --> 00:30:29.730\ninto there and how we might have to\ngenerate some of our own certificates.\n\n635\n00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:34.570\nAnd we got to see how to troubleshoot it\nusing the little hidden away test for\n\n636\n00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.700\nautodiscover inside of Microsoft Outlook.\n\n637\n00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.450\nBut stay tuned because in episode two\nwe're going to look at getting our\n\n638\n00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:40.520\ninternet users connecting.\n\n639\n00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.220\nHere this was a local area user,\nsomebody joined to the domain and\n\n640\n00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.470\nthat was the easy one.\n\n641\n00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.680\nIt's the ones that are outside,\nthe ones that are external.\n\n642\n00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.830\nThey're the hard ones.\n\n643\n00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.500\nAnd so we're gonna get a chance to see\nthat when somebody connects in and\n\n644\n00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.570\nsome of the stuff we have to\ndo to get that squared away.\n\n645\n00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.500\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n646\n00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.490\nBut for this episode,\nsigning off for ITProTV.\n\n647\n00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:58.999\nI'm

00:00:13.591\nGood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.070\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.980\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.820\nBack again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n8\n00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.430\nAnd in fact,\nback again with more Auto Discover.\n\n9\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.920\nThis is part two of our Microsoft\nexchange Auto Discover episodes and\n\n10\n00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.430\nwe're gonna be taking a look at the latter\nhalf of the Auto Discover service.\n\n11\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.840\nIn our first episode we got a chance to\nsee Auto Discover from the perspective of\n\n12\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.840\ninternal clients,\n\n13\n00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.350\nfrom our land clients, our machines that\nare joined to our Active Directory domain.\n\n14\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.210\nBut what about clients that\naren't a part of our domain?\n\n15\n00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.060\nWhat if somebody's on their own\npersonal computer at home or\n\n16\n00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.150\nthey're on their Android, or IOS, or\nWindows Mobile phone, and it's not\n\n17\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.000\nconnected to our systems at all, and they\nwant Auto Discover to work there, also.\n\n18\n00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.550\nAll right, well, there's a few\nthings that we're gonna have to do.\n\n19\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.480\nFirst off, when Auto Discover runs,\nthe first thing it does is look for\n\n20\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.110\nis your Active Directory information.\n\n21\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.270\nAnd for these types of clients.\n\n22\n00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.350\nFor external clients that doesn't exist.\n\n23\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.800\nSo step two, they look to DNS.\n\n24\n00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.940\nThey look to DNS and they're looking for\n\n25\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.710\none of two records that tell them\nwhere to find Auto Discover.\n\n26\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.970\nAnd it doesn't matter which of the two\nbecause neither of them exist by default.\n\n27\n00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.030\nWe've got to create them\nif we want that to work.\n\n28\n00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.710\nAll right.\n\n29\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.540\nSo what you need to do is, you need to\nthink about your user's e-mail addresses.\n\n30\n00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.050\nNow in the first part I showed you guys\nlogging in with the domain user and\n\n31\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.810\nI fired up Outlook.\n\n32\n00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.270\nAnd you probably saw there where Outlook,\nit figured out the person's name,\n\n33\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.650\nit figured out their e-mail address,\n\n34\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.620\nall we had to do was click next\na few times and we were configured.\n\n35\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.220\nAll right?\n\n36\n00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.240\nLet's watch that same process here for\nan external use.r So\n\n37\n00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.722\nhere I am on a workstation that\nhas a crazy background, but\n\n38\n00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:51.570\n[LAUGH] here I'm on a workstation for\nJane Doe.\n\n39\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.002\nAnd apparently Jane really likes fish.\n\n40\n00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.900\nSo [LAUGH] got all sorts\nof aquatic stuff here.\n\n41\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.910\nBut if I take a look at her computer,\nwe can see that it's a LAB client,\n\n42\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.320\nbut it's in WORKGROUP.\n\n43\n00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.860\nWork group.\n\n44\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.390\nShe's not joined to the domain.\n\n45\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.570\nSo she's an external user,\nshe's at home, she fires up Outlook,\n\n46\n00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.640\nshe's not joined to a domain.\n\n47\n00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.960\nWhat's she gonna get?\n\n48\n00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.110\nWell Outlook is gonna fire up.\n\n49\n00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.450\nAnd if this is the first time,\n\n50\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.280\nit's gonna offer to set her\nup with a new profile, right?\n\n51\n00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.640\nAnd it's gonna say, do you want\nto connect to an e-mail account?\n\n52\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.410\nAnd when she hits Next,\nif we were joined in the Active Directory,\n\n53\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.750\nthis would auto populate with\nyour name and e-mail address and\n\n54\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.440\nyou'd click Next, but\nnow it's just sitting here.\n\n55\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.770\nAll right, it's sitting here because as\nan external user it has no way of knowing.\n\n56\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.505\nIt doesn't know what your\ne-mail address is and\n\n57\n00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:35.848\nit can't look in the Active Directory for\nit so we have to tell it.\n\n58\n00:02:35.848 --> 00:02:40.321\nSo she's gonna come in here and\nput her information, and so,\n\n59\n00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:44.449\nyou know, if her email account\nis set up for Jane Smith and\n\n60\n00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.418\nher email address is jsmith@itprotv.net,\nright?\n\n61\n00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:51.670\nAnd you're going to punch that in and what\nour password is, you'll punch that in.\n\n62\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.800\nAll right, now it is asking for\ninformation, the user has to provide\n\n63\n00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.100\ninformation but, this is all\ninformation that your user should have.\n\n64\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.120\nThey know their name, hopefully,\nthey know their e-mail address, and\n\n65\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.330\nthey know their password.\n\n66\n00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.910\nSo it's not like we're asking them for\na server URL or port numbers or\n\n67\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.530\nany of the crazy stuff the users don't\nknow, this is information they do know.\n\n68\n00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.612\nAnd when we hit Next, what's going to\nhappen is Outlook is going to say,\n\n69\n00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:18.050\nall right I'm not joining the Active\nDirectory, so I have to skip step one and\n\n70\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.660\nI'm going to go to step two.\n\n71\n00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.460\nStep two is look to DNS.\n\n72\n00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.130\nAnd it's going to take your domain name.\n\n73\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.720\nMy domain name here is itprotv.net.\n\n74\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.210\nIt's going to take that domain name,\nand it's going to look for\n\n75\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.770\na server at itprotv.net, and on that\nserver it's going to look for a folder.\n\n76\n00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.340\nIt's basically going to do a secure web\nconnection, https on tcp port 443 and\n\n77\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.420\nit's gonna look for\nITProTV.net/autodiscover all right?\n\n78\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.210\nAnd then inside of there\n/autodiscover.xml it's gonna look for\n\n79\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.320\nthat file to get configuration, all right.\n\n80\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.045\nNow very few people actually have a\nnon-web server sitting at this address and\n\n81\n00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:55.095\nyou definitely don't have exchange servers\nsitting there on a normal environment.\n\n82\n00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:57.495\nSo, that's not always gonna work for us.\n\n83\n00:03:57.495 --> 00:04:01.425\nMaybe if our e-mail domain is\nspecifically for e-mail, but\n\n84\n00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:02.925\nmost people don't have that.\n\n85\n00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:06.305\nSo, after that one fails it's\ngonna go to the second effort.\n\n86\n00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:12.020\nAnd the second effort is to look for\nautodiscover.itprotv.net.\n\n87\n00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.652\nSo I need to make sure that for\nmy users out there on the Internet,\n\n88\n00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:19.560\nauto discover.itprotv.net has to resolve\nto one my client access servers.\n\n89\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.080\nAnd there's a really easy way to do that.\n\n90\n00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.320\nLet me show you.\n\n91\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.060\nI'm gonna jump over to one\nof my domain controllers.\n\n92\n00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.330\nAnd this is where I'm running DNS.\n\n93\n00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.200\nNow, you might be running\nDNS on your own servers.\n\n94\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.902\nYou might be running it on\nan external service like GoDaddy or\n\n95\n00:04:31.902 --> 00:04:37.266\nRegister.com, Hover.com,\none of those guys, it doesn't matter.\n\n96\n00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:40.440\nWhoever it is that's hosting your DNS,\nyou go to that server and\n\n97\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.330\nyou find your forward lookup zone for\nyour network.\n\n98\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.202\nSo mine was itprotv.net and\nwhat we need to do is add in a record for\n\n99\n00:04:48.202 --> 00:04:49.730\nAuto Discover.\n\n100\n00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.230\nNow you could add an A-record in there,\nbut I typically don't.\n\n101\n00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.610\nThe reason is we normally already have\na record for our client access server and\n\n102\n00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.310\nthere's no reason you can't reuse that.\n\n103\n00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.070\nWe can just do an alias that\nsays autodiscover.itprotv.net\n\n104\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.990\npoints to this already existing server.\n\n105\n00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.900\nAll right?\n\n106\n00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.520\nAnd the way you do that in DNS is\nwith a CNAME or a canonical name.\n\n107\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.470\nSo I'm gonna right click\nhere on itprotv.net,\n\n108\n00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.600\nand I'll do a new alias which is a CNAME.\n\n109\n00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.450\nAnd my alias is just\ngonna be autodiscover.\n\n110\n00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.655\nAnd see what it's filling in for me?\n\n111\n00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:23.760\nAutodiscover.itprotv.net, right?\n\n112\n00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.500\nThat's what these clients\nare gonna be looking for.\n\n113\n00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.820\nAnd all I have to do is point that at\nany one of my client access servers.\n\n114\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.960\nWell, I shouldn't say it that way.\n\n115\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.520\nNot any client access server.\n\n116\n00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.810\nIt's gotta be a client access server\nthat's accessible from the Internet.\n\n117\n00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.030\nYou might have ten client access servers.\n\n118\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.150\nBut only two are accessible\nfrom the Internet.\n\n119\n00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.670\nSo I need this to point to one of those\nguys that's exposed to the Internet.\n\n120\n00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.360\nAnd if I'm doing load balancing on it,\nthen I would want to point to the load\n\n121\n00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.410\nbalancing virtual name,\nnot the physical names of the servers.\n\n122\n00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.250\nSo there's different places\nyou might point this.\n\n123\n00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.760\nBut at a minimum, you need to point it\nto one of your Client Access Servers.\n\n124\n00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.960\nSo I'm gonna find my lab-caso1.\n\n125\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.980\nAnd I'll say okay to that.\n\n126\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.550\nAll right.\n\n127\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.045\nSo now autodiscover.itprotv.net is\npointing to lab-cas01.itprotv.net.\n\n128\n00:06:10.045 --> 00:06:14.410\nNow the advantage of doing CNAME is if\nI ever want to change that server's IP,\n\n129\n00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.630\nI can just go and\nchange lab-cas01's IP, and\n\n130\n00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.930\nthe alias points in the new IP,\nyou're done.\n\n131\n00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.970\nIf I had done an A-record instead,\nanytime I change the cast IP I would\n\n132\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.180\nhave to go and change the A-record for\nthe Auto Discover's IP also.\n\n133\n00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.110\nI'd have to change it in two places and\n\n134\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.600\nthe odds are we'll forget,\nthings break and you got problems.\n\n135\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.450\nSo it's always better\nto do a CNAME if can.\n\n136\n00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.740\nBut now if there's an external client\nthat's trying to resolve this,\n\n137\n00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.800\nthey'll actually be able to find it and\nthey'll get the client access server.\n\n138\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.639\nAnd we can test that out right from our\nclient if we fire up a command prompt.\n\n139\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.680\nAnd let me just boost up that font\nsize a little bit so we can see it.\n\n140\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.630\nAnd they can just do a quick NS lookup\nof autodiscover.itprotv.net and\n\n141\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.170\nsee if it resolves.\n\n142\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.690\nAnd I can see that it's an alias\nthat's pointing to lab-cas01\n\n143\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.840\nthat resolves to 192.168.0.12.\n\n144\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.560\nAnd, so there is no server at\nauto discover.itvpro.net, but\n\n145\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.240\nthis points us to it.\n\n146\n00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.950\nAnd, so now we can get there, and\nwe should be able to resolve that,\n\n147\n00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.920\nassuming the client accessor\nis exposed to the Internet.\n\n148\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.510\nNow, when I say exposed to the Internet,\nwhat do we mean?\n\n149\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.590\nAt a minimum, just for\nAuto Discover to work.\n\n150\n00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.140\nWe need TCP port 443, right?\n\n151\n00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.570\nSecure HTTP traffic.\n\n152\n00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.130\nThat's what we need.\n\n153\n00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.650\nWe need that open.\n\n154\n00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.130\nRight?\nYou're gonna need that for\n\n155\n00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.430\nOutlook web access or Outlook web app.\n\n156\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.300\nYou're gonna need it for\nthe offline address book.\n\n157\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.180\nYou're gonna need it for\nthe exchange control panel.\n\n158\n00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.070\nSo, you're gonna need\nthat port open anyway.\n\n159\n00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.150\nSo, on a client access\nserver at a minimum.\n\n160\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.560\nWe need that 443 open, TCP port 443 for\npeople to be able to connect.\n\n161\n00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.010\nAnd that's going to make Auto Discover,\nOutlook Web Ap, all those other ones,\n\n162\n00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.140\nit's going to make them all work,\nall right.\n\n163\n00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.160\nBut there's a few other services\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n164\n00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.720\nWhen you're configuring that client access\nserver to be exposed to the iInternet\n\n165\n00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.050\nyou may wanna configure a few more.\n\n166\n00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.960\nAnd I'll post all these\nwith the show notes.\n\n167\n00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.590\nBut let me just show you right here.\n\n168\n00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.360\nThese are the ports that we want to\nmake available from the Internet for\n\n169\n00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.930\ndifferent services.\n\n170\n00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.710\nSo for example, SMTP.\n\n171\n00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.830\nYou're incoming and\noutgoing email uses S/SMTP.\n\n172\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.310\nSo if this client access server's going\nto be that point of entry, we're going\n\n173\n00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:22.490\nto need to have port 25 open for\nnon-secure and port 587 open for secure.\n\n174\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.820\nYour clients, right like Outlook,\nthey'll use that 587,\n\n175\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.675\nthey'll use that secure connection,\nbut servers when they're moving\n\n176\n00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.933\ne-mail back and forth will use this\nnon-secure port 25, all right.\n\n177\n00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.800\nIf you choose to use pop 3.\n\n178\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.730\nYou'll need port 110 for\nnon-secure and 995 for secure.\n\n179\n00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.440\nAnd if you choose to support IMAP4,\nyou'll need 143 for\n\n180\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.060\nIMAP nonsecure and\nthen 993 for secure IMAP.\n\n181\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.220\nAnd you don't have to turn them all on.\n\n182\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.860\nMaybe I just want the secure ones.\n\n183\n00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.920\nSo I might not turn on 110 and 143.\n\n184\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.680\nI might just turn on 995 and 993.\n\n185\n00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.930\nNow, what do I mean by turned on?\n\n186\n00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.980\nWell, I mean.\n\n187\n00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.060\nGo to your firewall and\nopen up those ports on the firewall.\n\n188\n00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.700\nYour firewall will be blocking these by\ndefault for your client access server.\n\n189\n00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.430\nBut at a minimum we need this guy and\n\n190\n00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.350\nanother neat little thing here it\ndoesn't have to be direct connectivity.\n\n191\n00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.670\nWe don't have to allow our clients\nto connect directly to this.\n\n192\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.490\nYou might have a reverse proxy.\n\n193\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.954\nRight, there's plenty of companies\nout there that make reverse proxies,\n\n194\n00:09:19.954 --> 00:09:20.860\neven Microsoft.\n\n195\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.640\nMicrosoft has their threat-management\ngateway which used to be the ISA,\n\n196\n00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.390\nthe Internet Security and\nAcceleration server.\n\n197\n00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.508\nNow it's there,\nthe threat-management gateway.\n\n198\n00:09:28.508 --> 00:09:33.440\nAnd it can sit in-between your cache, your\nclient access servers, and the Internet.\n\n199\n00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.030\nAnd it can inspect traffic.\n\n200\n00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.800\nAnd block attacks before they\neven get to your system.\n\n201\n00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.340\nIt could be things like\na Cisco Intrusion Detection Service.\n\n202\n00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:47.195\nIf could be a say, F5, they have\nthe firepass boxes that do the same thing.\n\n203\n00:09:47.195 --> 00:09:50.075\nThere's a number of different vendors out\nthere that make these reverse proxies that\n\n204\n00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:51.725\ncan sit in between your system and\nthe Internet.\n\n205\n00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:56.277\nSo if that's the case,\nyou need 443 open to the reverse proxy.\n\n206\n00:09:56.277 --> 00:09:58.395\nAnd then the proxy would need to\nbe able to talk to your server.\n\n207\n00:09:58.395 --> 00:10:00.835\nSo just keep that in mind,\nyour security configuration might vary.\n\n208\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.246\nAll right, but assuming all of that's\nopen, we should be able to connect and\n\n209\n00:10:05.246 --> 00:10:06.940\nAuto Discover should work.\n\n210\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.370\nNow I'm throwing my IT department\nshould in there to give me some\n\n211\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.620\ncoverage if it doesn't work.\n\n212\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.310\nBut I'm gonna punch in my name, my e-mail\naddress, and when I hit Next it's gonna\n\n213\n00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.780\nlook first for itprotv.net/autodiscover,\nwhich it's not going to find.\n\n214\n00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.830\nThen it's gonna fail over to\nAuto Discover to itprotv.net,\n\n215\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.150\nwhich we just created and it will find.\n\n216\n00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.690\nAnd so\nit's gonna reach out to that system.\n\n217\n00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:33.710\nIt's searching for the settings and it\nshould find those settings and configure.\n\n218\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.900\nNow Auto Discover over the wham\nalmost always takes longer.\n\n219\n00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.080\nIt's gotta reach along the Internet and\nconnect to the stuff.\n\n220\n00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.220\nAnd, so it may take a little bit longer,\nbut when its done, it'll connect.\n\n221\n00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:49.520\nNow, the most common point of failure here\nif this doesn't work, are certificates.\n\n222\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.460\nIf there are certificates on\nthe server and we don't trust them,\n\n223\n00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.260\nthen Auto Discover is going to fail,\nand its not going to work right?\n\n224\n00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.870\nSo certificates are that\nnumber one problem,\n\n225\n00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.090\nthat we might have to go and re-issue\ncertificates, or get updated ones.\n\n226\n00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.930\nAn easy way to test that while we wait is\nto just fire up a web browser and try and\n\n227\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.390\nlog in to OWA.\n\n228\n00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:13.430\nSo if I browse to my client\naccess server-OWA, right?\n\n229\n00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.110\nIf I go to the OWA page and\nit goes secure,\n\n230\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.050\nI see the little lock up here there,\nright?\n\n231\n00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.830\nIf I get the red bar,\nI know I've got a certificate problem and\n\n232\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.980\nthat's going to make\nAuto Discover not work.\n\n233\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.410\nAnd you can test even further.\n\n234\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:32.280\nI went to, the sever that I went\nto was lab-cas01.itprotv.net.\n\n235\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.210\nBut that's not what my clients\nare going to, are they?\n\n236\n00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.880\nThey're going to autodiscover.itprotv.net.\n\n237\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.390\nAnd so I can punch that in as if\nI was gonna login to OWA there.\n\n238\n00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:51.800\nAnd so I'm saying, I'm trying to say,\nhttps://autodiscover.itprotv.net/owa and\n\n239\n00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.500\nwhen I browse to that,\nit's gonna hit the CNAME.\n\n240\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.700\nSo I still see Auto Discover up there,\nand my lock is still good.\n\n241\n00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.760\nSo in my case, my certificates are good.\n\n242\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.360\nI shouldn't have any problems there.\n\n243\n00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.730\nLet's go see what Outlook is doing.\n\n244\n00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.720\nOh, and Outlook is finished\nwhile I gabbed on and on.\n\n245\n00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.580\nNow, it downloaded the settings\nfrom Auto Discover, so\n\n246\n00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.320\nnow it knows the server to connect to.\n\n247\n00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.980\nIt knows the ports to use.\n\n248\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.540\nIt knows all that information.\n\n249\n00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.760\nWe gave it our username and password.\n\n250\n00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.550\nWe're now configured.\n\n251\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.040\nYou could actually go in and\nchange the settings if you wanted,\n\n252\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.280\nmanually go in and mess with it.\n\n253\n00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.180\nBut for the most part, it's done,\nand now Outlook is gonna fire up and\n\n254\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.690\nI'm connected.\n\n255\n00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.300\nI had to create that DNSS record to\nget this to work and have it in place.\n\n256\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.670\nNow, the cool part is,\n\n257\n00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.210\nonce this is set up,\nIt's not just set up for basic Outlook.\n\n258\n00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.700\nIt's also set up for other advanced\nfeatures like the offline address book and\n\n259\n00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.920\nMail Tips for example.\n\n260\n00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.200\nLet me show you Mail Tips.\n\n261\n00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.070\nMail Tips are a neat feature.\n\n262\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.660\nIt's a feature that's kind of\ntacked on to the Outlook Web app.\n\n263\n00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.930\nAnd Auto Discover connects it, but\na lot of people don't even know it exists.\n\n264\n00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.000\nAnd so you never see Mail Tips very much.\n\n265\n00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.820\nWhat Microsoft did is they said, look,\na lot of times, people draft e-mails, and\n\n266\n00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.570\nthey get blocked.\n\n267\n00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.270\nYou get an NDR, a nondelivery report.\n\n268\n00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.090\nThat NDR doesn't always come right away.\n\n269\n00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.450\nYou guys have probably had this before.\n\n270\n00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.640\nHave you ever sent an email, and\n\n271\n00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.650\nthen a day later you get a message\nsaying this email has been delayed?\n\n272\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.440\nOr this email failed to deliver?\n\n273\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.980\nWhat you're getting is\na nondelivery report, and NDR.\n\n274\n00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.790\nAnd, that's telling you\nthere was a problem but\n\n275\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.650\nyou didn't know that right away.\n\n276\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.360\nIt took a while for that to happen.\n\n277\n00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.330\nWell, there are times where we\nalready know something is gonna fail.\n\n278\n00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.970\nAnd so the server can actually\ntell people ahead of time, or\n\n279\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:31.930\nit can just tell them anything.\n\n280\n00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.390\nYou can actually give it\nany message you want, and\n\n281\n00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.880\nthat will generate what's\ncalled a Mail Tip.\n\n282\n00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.960\nA little on screen prompt that\nlet you know there's a problem.\n\n283\n00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.070\nAnd I like to use Mail Tips as a great\nway to test connectivity beyond just your\n\n284\n00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:45.800\nbasic email connectivity.\n\n285\n00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.990\nSo let me show you how Mail Tips work.\n\n286\n00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.920\nLet's say that I'm a user,\nI'm Jane here, I'm logged in.\n\n287\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.850\nAnd I'm about to fire off an e-mail to me,\nto Don Pezet.\n\n288\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.300\nI'm not in the office, right?\n\n289\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.300\nOr maybe I've been fired.\n\n290\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.240\nSo I've been fired, but\n\n291\n00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.400\nmy e-mail account is still active\nbecause we're collecting e-mails on it.\n\n292\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.070\nBut I've been fired.\n\n293\n00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.310\nWell, I might want a way to\ntell Jane that that's happened.\n\n294\n00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.500\nI haven't disabled the account\ncuz I'm still collecting e-mails.\n\n295\n00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.080\nSo she doesn't necessarily know that.\n\n296\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.820\nIf she goes in to craft a new e-mail.\n\n297\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.050\nShe could fire off an e-mail to Don Pezet.\n\n298\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:25.120\nAnd it'll find me in the list\ncuz my account's not disabled.\n\n299\n00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:32.160\nAnd I need a quick favor, and\ncan you update this document for me?\n\n300\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.380\nOr something like that.\n\n301\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.200\nAll right?\n\n302\n00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.890\nSo she fires off this e-mail.\n\n303\n00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.510\nShe doesn't know that my account is no\nlonger active, that I've been terminated.\n\n304\n00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.260\nIt's all invisible to her, right?\n\n305\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.530\nAnd then, maybe later on down the road,\n\n306\n00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.990\nwe disable that account and now she\ntries to e-mail and she gets an NDR.\n\n307\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.283\nWouldn't it have been nice if we could\nhave given her some kind of confirmation\n\n308\n00:14:50.283 --> 00:14:51.370\nahead of time for that?\n\n309\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:52.670\nAnd, a Mail Tip will do it.\n\n310\n00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.920\nSo, all we have to do is as an\nadministrator, if we log into our exchange\n\n311\n00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.960\nadmin center, you can go to recipients and\nyou can pick somebody's mail box.\n\n312\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.820\nSo, I'll take my mailbox.\n\n313\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.980\nAnd when you edit the mailbox, you'll see\ndifferent settings down the left side,\n\n314\n00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.400\nand one of them is a Mail Tip, right?\n\n315\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.070\nAnd here,\nyou can type in any message you want.\n\n316\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.875\nYou can type up to 175 characters,\nkinda like a tweet.\n\n317\n00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:17.170\n[LAUGH] You can type\nwhatever you want in there.\n\n318\n00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.830\nAnd when a user goes\nto e-mail this person,\n\n319\n00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.970\nthey'll see this message on screen letting\nthem now before they even hit send.\n\n320\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.840\nWe can avoid those NDR's\nbefore they even happen.\n\n321\n00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.960\nSo we can say something like,\nthis employee has been terminated.\n\n322\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.700\nPlease forward requests to John Doe or\nsomebody else.\n\n323\n00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.740\nJust giving them that\nmessage to let them know.\n\n324\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.070\nSo that's the Mail Tip that I'm defining.\n\n325\n00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:50.260\nMail tips are delivered by a secure\nweb connection between Outlook and\n\n326\n00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.600\nthe mail server, the client access server.\n\n327\n00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.300\nWe're checking in to get those\nalongside of our e-mail.\n\n328\n00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.400\nIt's like a secondary connection.\n\n329\n00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.450\nSo, when I go back to Jane,\nhere she is in Outlook, and\n\n330\n00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:07.500\nif we go to craft a new e-mail,\nand we go to e-mail me, right?\n\n331\n00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.780\nWhen we do that, in the background,\n\n332\n00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.700\nit's gonna do a lookup to see if\nthere's any Mail Tips available.\n\n333\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.950\nAnd, it's gonna populate them and\ndisplay them right here.\n\n334\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.850\nNow, Mail Tips take a little\nbit to actually get in there,\n\n335\n00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.090\nbecause a lot of this gets cached.\n\n336\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.740\nRemember, Outlook runs in\ncache mode by default, so\n\n337\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.005\nthis information is getting kind of\ncached down, and then run locally.\n\n338\n00:16:27.005 --> 00:16:29.050\nYour Mail Tips actually get cached too.\n\n339\n00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.476\nIf there's e-mail that you, or people that\nyou e-mail frequently, you'll cache their\n\n340\n00:16:32.476 --> 00:16:35.860\nMail Tips, so you'll see them even when\nyou're offline, which is pretty neat.\n\n341\n00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.890\nBut, it means I'm not going\nto see this one right away.\n\n342\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.220\nBut we'll see it, there's actually\na couple of ways we can generate this one,\n\n343\n00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.310\nlet me log in to OWA and\nwe'll see it here.\n\n344\n00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:49.240\nSo if I log in as, let's see,\nwho is she, janesmith@itprotv.net,\n\n345\n00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.800\nwhich I think I've misspelled\nevery single time this episode.\n\n346\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.480\nSo I'm gonna get logged in as her,\n\n347\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.180\napparently this is the first\ntime she's logged in, all right.\n\n348\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.830\nAnd OWA is nice because it's not cached,\nright?\n\n349\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.060\nWe're seeing information\nright from the server.\n\n350\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.995\nSo when she drafts an e-mail here, and\nshe goes to e-mail Don Pezet, right?\n\n351\n00:17:10.995 --> 00:17:14.005\nIt's searching for\nthat user and it finds me, and\n\n352\n00:17:14.005 --> 00:17:17.035\nthen look at the message that just\nappeared right there, Don Pezet.\n\n353\n00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:18.255\nThis employee has been terminated.\n\n354\n00:17:18.255 --> 00:17:19.835\nPlease forward requests to John Doe.\n\n355\n00:17:19.835 --> 00:17:22.245\nShe sees an on-screen prompt\nthat lets her know that.\n\n356\n00:17:22.245 --> 00:17:23.395\nThat's a Mail Tip.\n\n357\n00:17:23.395 --> 00:17:23.945\nOkay?\n\n358\n00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:26.595\nAnd that's one of the other things\nthat Auto Discover is configuring.\n\n359\n00:17:26.595 --> 00:17:31.205\nIt configures a lot of things,\nyour e-mail, your contacts, your calendar,\n\n360\n00:17:31.205 --> 00:17:34.070\nyour tasks, right,\ngetting all that set up with the server.\n\n361\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.520\nIt sets up a lot.\n\n362\n00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.870\nIt's really pretty interesting.\n\n363\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.710\nPretty neat stuff,\nall done with automatic discovery.\n\n364\n00:17:41.552 --> 00:17:44.200\nAll right,\nI feel like I'm leaving something out but\n\n365\n00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.110\nI think that's the bulk of it.\n\n366\n00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:50.640\nLet my just scan my notes real quick,\noh it looks like that's about it.\n\n367\n00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.440\nSo key things to remember here,\nlet's wrap this one up.\n\n368\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.380\nSo key things to remember when it\ncomes to setting up Auto Discover,\n\n369\n00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.978\nit really is two separate entities.\n\n370\n00:17:57.978 --> 00:18:01.640\nThere's Auto Discover for LAN clients,\nclients that are joined to your domain.\n\n371\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.560\nAnd then there's Auto Discover for\nexternal clients, people that are outside.\n\n372\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.600\nOn the inside we need to make sure\nthat we've got valid certificates.\n\n373\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.990\nThat's important, although the self-signed\ncertificate might work fine for us.\n\n374\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.556\nWe also need to make sure that our clients\nare joining the Active Directory and\n\n375\n00:18:15.556 --> 00:18:17.210\nAuto Discover will work.\n\n376\n00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.810\nFor clients on the outside,\nwe need valid certificates, same thing.\n\n377\n00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.490\nBut we also need to make\nsure that we've got\n\n378\n00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.270\nour firewall open to allow connectivity,\nand that we've got a DNS record.\n\n379\n00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.530\nBecause the Active Directory lookups\nwon't work for those external users.\n\n380\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.778\nSo that's an important one to make\nsure that we've got that too.\n\n381\n00:18:33.778 --> 00:18:38.220\nAll right, but\nafter that Auto Discover just works.\n\n382\n00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.080\nYou get it configured and you put it outta\nyour mind, and you forget all about it and\n\n383\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.040\nyears go by everybody is already\nconfiguring and it really works out well,\n\n384\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.030\nso that's basically it.\n\n385\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.940\nAll right well, in this episode we got\na chance to see the second part of\n\n386\n00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.600\nAuto Discover.\n\n387\n00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.180\nWe created a DNS entry.\n\n388\n00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.900\nRemember I did a CNAME on that one.\n\n389\n00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.060\nCNAME or aliases are always better than\na records cuz it makes maintenance\n\n390\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.080\na little bit easier.\n\n391\n00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.960\nWe saw that external client connect.\n\n392\n00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.890\nWe also saw how we could test that\nconnectivity, actually we saw that in part\n\n393\n00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.980\none, to make sure that Auto Discover\nis working for our users.\n\n394\n00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.130\nAnd then at the end of the episode I\ncovered Mail Tips, a little bit off topic,\n\n395\n00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.015\nbut it's something that is set up\nas part of Auto Discover also.\n\n396\n00:19:11.015 --> 00:19:12.955\nSo definitely something\nyou want to be aware of.\n\n397\n00:19:12.955 --> 00:19:15.575\nAnd easy to use, a neat little\nfeature that's baked in there,\n\n398\n00:19:15.575 --> 00:19:17.377\na lot of people don't know about it.\n\n399\n00:19:17.377 --> 00:19:19.875\nAll right well that's all I've got for\nAuto Discover, so\n\n400\n00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:21.365\nwe'll wrap this two part series up.\n\n401\n00:19:21.365 --> 00:19:22.675\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n402\n00:19:22.675 --> 00:19:26.515\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n403\n00:19:26.515 --> 00:19:27.272\n[SOUND]\n\n",

good evening.\n\n4\n00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.080\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.411\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n6\n00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:20.807\nback again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n7\n00:00:20.807 --> 00:00:21.877\nAnd in this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:21.877 --> 00:00:25.450\nwe're going to be taking a look at\nthe exciting world of mobile access.\n\n9\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.970\nAnd by mobile access I mean, well,\nthe whole bring your own device movement.\n\n10\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.130\nYou got a lot people bringing cell phones,\nand tablets,\n\n11\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.330\nand all sorts of other\ngear into your network.\n\n12\n00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.730\nAnd it does create a little\nbit of a management issue and\n\n13\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.860\nit creates a bit of a security risk,\nby having this data out there.\n\n14\n00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.830\nWell fortunately Microsoft Exchange\n2013 has an amazing set of mobile device\n\n15\n00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.010\nmanagement or MDM features built right\ninto it, so we don't need third party\n\n16\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.830\nsoftware like a Blackberry Enterprise\nServer or Good Server, or whatever.\n\n17\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.059\nWe can use the MDM built right\ninto Exchange to manage and\n\n18\n00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.180\nsecure our remote devices and\neven to remote wipe them if they get lost,\n\n19\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.716\nall while letting users maintain control\nof their own device through the whole\n\n20\n00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:06.660\nbring your own device movement.\n\n21\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.332\nSo it's pretty neat, and\nthis works with Windows mobile phone,\n\n22\n00:01:10.332 --> 00:01:14.820\nwith Android, with iOS, Microsoft\ndoesn't really care which phone you use.\n\n23\n00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.770\nNow they do have limited features on some\nthings like on BlackBerries, but on IOS,\n\n24\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.870\nAndroid, and Windows Mobile, the big\nthree those, well I say the big three,\n\n25\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.300\nWindows Mobile is like small three.\n\n26\n00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.570\nBut, [LAUGH], we've got that functionality\nand features to secure and manage them,\n\n27\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.200\nso let's take a look at how that works.\n\n28\n00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.580\nFirst off, whenever you set\nup a user inside of Exchange,\n\n29\n00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.070\nthe whole mobile functionality\nis kind of enabled by default.\n\n30\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.120\nThey get that functionality\non their account.\n\n31\n00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.470\nIf I take a look at a user, like here\nI am in my Exchange admin center.\n\n32\n00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.090\nIf I go under recipients and I take any\none of these, I'll just take mine for\n\n33\n00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.420\nexample.\n\n34\n00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.330\nIf I go and edit the user,\nwhen we go and look in the user,\n\n35\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.760\nyou'll see different things, and\nwe're looking for mailbox features.\n\n36\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.250\nAnd here you'll see things\nthat are turned on.\n\n37\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.110\nAnd right down here,\nI've got mobile devices.\n\n38\n00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.200\nAnd you'll see Exchange ActiveSync and\nOWA for Devices.\n\n39\n00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.000\nThose are two different connectivity\nmethods that devices can use to establish\n\n40\n00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.440\na connection to your mailbox.\n\n41\n00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.970\nAnd it's not just as simple\nas checking your email.\n\n42\n00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.670\nIf it would just checking your email,\nyou'd use POP3 or\n\n43\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.990\nIMAP4 and then you'd be done.\n\n44\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.990\nBut what these two methods\nbring us is a lot more.\n\n45\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.196\nLet's talk about ActiveSync.\n\n46\n00:02:23.196 --> 00:02:25.830\nActiveSync is the primary\nconnection method.\n\n47\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.850\nAnd that's the one we wanted.\n\n48\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.030\nThis is a little confusing here.\n\n49\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.970\nSo see how it says\nDisable Exchange Active Synch?\n\n50\n00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.770\nThat's how I know ActiveSync\nis turned on for me right now.\n\n51\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.160\nAnd so by default it's turned on, and\nit's giving me the option to turn it off.\n\n52\n00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.020\nIf I turn it off, it'll change to\nsay Enable Exchange ActiveSync and\n\n53\n00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.568\nI can turn that on.\n\n54\n00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:46.580\nThe way ActiveSync works is it uses\nautodiscover, which if you watch our\n\n55\n00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.890\nautodiscover episode, you're familiar\nwith, a client like an Android phone, can\n\n56\n00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.680\nlook at your email address, reach out to\nthe internet, and find your mail server.\n\n57\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.380\nAnd when it finds your mail server\nit can look for the ActiveSync\n\n58\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.950\nconfiguration file that'll tell it how\na phone should connect to the server.\n\n59\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.450\nAnd when it connects,\nit provides your username and password and\n\n60\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.820\nnow it has access to your email,\nyour tasks, your calendar, your contacts,\n\n61\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.940\nall that information right\nthere from your phone.\n\n62\n00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.880\nBut at the same time,\nit enables two really cool things.\n\n63\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.020\nThe first is a security policy.\n\n64\n00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.530\nIn exchange we have a mobile\nsecurity policy where we can dictate\n\n65\n00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.290\nhey your phone has to have a screen lock\nafter a certain amount of minutes and\n\n66\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.610\nit's got to be a pin number of\ngreater than these amount of numbers.\n\n67\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.660\nOr we need to be able to\nremote wipe your machine.\n\n68\n00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.040\nOr we need to limit the apps\nyou're allowed to run.\n\n69\n00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.880\nThat's part of the security policy, and\nwhen you connect the Exchange ActiveSync,\n\n70\n00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.830\nthat's what enables that policy.\n\n71\n00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.600\nRight?\n\n72\n00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.010\nThe other thing that enables is what's\ncalled Direct Push Notification.\n\n73\n00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.380\nOn older mobile systems, the way they\nworked is you'd connect through a POP3 or\n\n74\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.030\nIMAP4 and then 15 minutes or every 10\nminutes your phone would reach out and\n\n75\n00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.650\ncheck your mailbox for new mail.\n\n76\n00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.190\nRight.\n\n77\n00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.020\nWell, you might not get a lot of email.\n\n78\n00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.330\nAnd if you don't get a lot of email it's\nchecking all throughout the day keeping\n\n79\n00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.650\nyour phone awake, and\nburning up your battery.\n\n80\n00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.860\nAnd so a lot of systems that did that,\nthese are called pull notifications where\n\n81\n00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.580\nyou reach out to the server and\npull them down.\n\n82\n00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.840\nThose pull notifications drain\nyour battery and that stinks.\n\n83\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.480\nAnd people wanna know\nabout email right away,\n\n84\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.270\nthey don't wanna wait 10 or 15 minutes.\n\n85\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.920\nSo if you lowered it down to one minute\nyou definitely saw a hit on your battery.\n\n86\n00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.660\nWell, the way direct\npush notifications work\n\n87\n00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.220\nis instead of your client reaching out to\nthe server every so often to check for\n\n88\n00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.830\nmail, the server tells you\nwhen new email comes in.\n\n89\n00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.590\nSo if an hour goes by and no emails come\nin, the server just doesn't bother you.\n\n90\n00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.300\nBut if an email does come in,\nthe server immediately tells you.\n\n91\n00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.150\nSo you get a battery savings, and you get\nimmediate notification of new email and\n\n92\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.710\nthat's really cool, all right?\n\n93\n00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.310\nLet me talk a little bit about\ndirect push before I move into\n\n94\n00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.690\nthe configuration stuff.\n\n95\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.480\nSo the way direct push works is by\nmanipulating the way TCP works.\n\n96\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.590\nTCP, the transmission control protocol,\n\n97\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.360\nis used for the majority of our\ncommunications on the internet.\n\n98\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.890\nWhen you reach out to a website,\nfor example,\n\n99\n00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.010\nyou open up a TCP session to a server and\nyou say, give me a copy of your webpage.\n\n100\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.740\nAnd the server responds by transmitting\nthe webpage over that session.\n\n101\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.580\nWell the session has a timeout, and\n\n102\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.548\nit says hey, give me a copy of\nthe webpage and you got 30 seconds.\n\n103\n00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:22.080\nAnd if the 30 seconds run out\nthen the session times out and\n\n104\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.610\nyou get an error message on your screen,\nand you can try again, right?\n\n105\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.250\nWell with direct push, what happens is\nyour phone reaches out to Exchange,\n\n106\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.740\nand it says hey,\ngive me any new email I get.\n\n107\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.180\nAnd then it sets the time out to\na really big number, all right?\n\n108\n00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.700\nI think it's 30 minutes.\n\n109\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.240\nIt might be a full hour.\n\n110\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.260\nI think it's 30 minutes.\n\n111\n00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.910\nSo, it sets if for like 30 minutes.\n\n112\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.960\nAnd it says, hey,\nif I get a new email, send it to me.\n\n113\n00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.864\nAnd the server says, okay, I'm gonna wait.\n\n114\n00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:49.887\nAnd it just start to wait.\n\n115\n00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:51.630\nIt just sits there,and it waits.\n\n116\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.190\nAnd if a new email comes in,\nit can immediately send it to us.\n\n117\n00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.300\nBut if nothing comes in,\nit waits the full 30 minutes, and\n\n118\n00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.200\nright at the end of the 30 minutes,\nit says, oop, you didn't get an email,\n\n119\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.880\nand then the session closes, and\nyour phone opens a new session.\n\n120\n00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.030\nAnd so now your phone's only opening\na session once every half hour, that's no\n\n121\n00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.410\nbig deal, and then it just sits there and\nwaits for the server to respond back.\n\n122\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.420\nIt's very efficient, it's very quick,\nand it works really well, all right.\n\n123\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.950\nNow there are some little\nquirks that can happen.\n\n124\n00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.212\nYou might have a firewall for\nexample, that's monitoring for\n\n125\n00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:21.214\nextended sessions and blocking them so you\nmight have to tweak your firewall a bit.\n\n126\n00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.496\nBut pretty much every\nsystem does this today so\n\n127\n00:06:23.496 --> 00:06:27.000\nmost firewalls are already aware of it and\nit's not a big deal.\n\n128\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.010\nBut that's another function of\nExchange ActiveSync, all right.\n\n129\n00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.400\nNow not every device supports\nExchange ActiveSync.\n\n130\n00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.530\nIf, let's say, you decided you're\ngonna open up your own company and\n\n131\n00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.750\nyou're gonna make your own Android phone.\n\n132\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.256\nSo, you start manufacturing\nyour own Android phone.\n\n133\n00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:44.619\nIf you want to support ActiveSync,\nyou have to call Microsoft up, and\n\n134\n00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:46.048\nsign a licensing agreement.\n\n135\n00:06:46.048 --> 00:06:48.928\nYou have to pay them money, you have to\npay a certain amount of money per phone\n\n136\n00:06:48.928 --> 00:06:51.673\nthat you sell, and so some companies say,\nyou know what, forget that,\n\n137\n00:06:51.673 --> 00:06:54.530\nwe're not gonna support ActiveSync,\nwe wanna save the money.\n\n138\n00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.870\nAnd so they don't do it.\n\n139\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.260\nAnd for\nthose devices they have option number two.\n\n140\n00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.200\nOption number two is OWA for devices and\nthat's this one right here at the bottom.\n\n141\n00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.550\nAnd what it is, is Outlook Web App, it's\nthe web interface but it's designed where\n\n142\n00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.310\ninstead of giving us a nice GUI that's all\npretty, it just gives you a bunch of XML.\n\n143\n00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.680\nA bunch of raw XML data.\n\n144\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.430\nAnd you can have a client on your phone\nthat interprets that XML data and\n\n145\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.110\nrenders it in its own client.\n\n146\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.080\nAnd so you still have access to\nyour contacts, your calendar,\n\n147\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.590\nyour inbox, your to-do list.\n\n148\n00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.160\nYou still have access to all that, it's\njust done without that ActiveSync license.\n\n149\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.220\nAnd it's done without direct push, and\nit's done without the security policies.\n\n150\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.270\nYou loose a lot of functionality\nby doing it that way.\n\n151\n00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.580\nBut those are the two.\n\n152\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.830\nIf I'm in a high security environment and\nI want to ensure that my policies\n\n153\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.040\nare taking effect,\nI'd probably disable OWA for devices.\n\n154\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.990\nBut if I'm just wanting anybody to be\nable to connect whatever way works,\n\n155\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.830\nthis is secure.\n\n156\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.470\nIt does use SSL, but I don't get\nthe benefit of policies and so on.\n\n157\n00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.708\nSo those are kind of the two different\nconnectivity methods that we have.\n\n158\n00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:56.177\nNow I mentioned these security policies.\n\n159\n00:07:56.177 --> 00:08:00.864\nWhen people connect up, there's a security\npolicy that's created, and it's applied.\n\n160\n00:08:00.864 --> 00:08:04.365\nOn the left side of my EAC,\nyou'll see mobile.\n\n161\n00:08:04.365 --> 00:08:07.017\nAnd under mobile,\nhere we've got mobile device access and so\n\n162\n00:08:07.017 --> 00:08:09.830\nit's got information about\nwho's allowed to connect.\n\n163\n00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.440\nBut right beside it,\nis the mobile device mailbox policies.\n\n164\n00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.310\nAnd here's where I can define\nhow my devices are handled.\n\n165\n00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.890\nYou can have just one big\npolicy that covers everybody or\n\n166\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.680\nyou can create different policies for\ndifferent users.\n\n167\n00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.300\nMaybe my sales people\nhave one set of policies.\n\n168\n00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.030\nMy executives have another policy.\n\n169\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.180\nMy mailbox [INAUDIBLE] my marketing\npeople have a third policy.\n\n170\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.470\nYou can define each one different because\nsome people might have sensitive data,\n\n171\n00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.920\nsome people might not.\n\n172\n00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.760\nBut usually we stick with the default,\nright?\n\n173\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.240\nAll employees are treated the same way.\n\n174\n00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.510\nWe have a standard level of security.\n\n175\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.980\nAnd you can edit that and here's where you\ncan define all sorts of really neat stuff.\n\n176\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.080\nWell, not so much on this screen, but if\nI go to security, here's the neat stuff.\n\n177\n00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.920\nAll right?\n\n178\n00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.960\nI might want to require that, hey if\nyou're connecting your company mailbox\n\n179\n00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.170\nonto your phone,\nwe need to secure that data.\n\n180\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.470\nSo, you need to have\na password on your phone.\n\n181\n00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.530\nWe're gonna require you\nto have a password.\n\n182\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.540\nAnd maybe we don't want a simple password.\n\n183\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.510\nMaybe we wanna require\nit to be alpha-numeric.\n\n184\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.110\nMaybe we want it to be letters and\nnumbers and all that stuff.\n\n185\n00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.560\nBut normally you would\nwant it to be a pin.\n\n186\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.080\nThat would be a simple password.\n\n187\n00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.610\nAnd so they're showing those here,\nsimple password sequences.\n\n188\n00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.890\nYou can set it so it includes\na certain amount of characters.\n\n189\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.120\nYou can require encryption on the device.\n\n190\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.510\niOS and Android both support\nencrypting the device.\n\n191\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.830\niOS I believe does it by default,\nAndroid doesn't do it by default.\n\n192\n00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.470\nBlackberry does do it by default.\n\n193\n00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.440\nSo different ones have different\nrequirements there, but\n\n194\n00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.870\nyou can choose to require\nthe device be encrypted.\n\n195\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.750\nYou can set that minimum password link,\n\n196\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.550\nmaybe I want it to be at\nleast four characters.\n\n197\n00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.230\nNumber of sign on failures\nbefore a device is wiped.\n\n198\n00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.660\nYou can make it where if somebody's\ntrying to brute force the password and\n\n199\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.900\nthey get it wrong too many times,\nit erases the phone.\n\n200\n00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.850\nThat's kinda neat, right?\n\n201\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.010\nA great way to secure that data.\n\n202\n00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.340\nWe've also got required sign in\nafter the device has been active.\n\n203\n00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.790\nSo if somebody walks away from their\ntablet, and they didn't lock it,\n\n204\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.380\nright, how long do we want it to\ngo before requiring that sign in?\n\n205\n00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.910\nSo I might set that to something lower,\nlike five minutes.\n\n206\n00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.880\nOkay.\n\n207\n00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.040\nHere we got enforce a password lifetime.\n\n208\n00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.480\nA lot of people set a PIN on their\nphone and then they never change it.\n\n209\n00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.030\nSo maybe I want to set a maximum time for\nthem to be able to use that password\n\n210\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.710\nbefore they have to change it again and\na password recycle count.\n\n211\n00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.145\nI don't want them reusing the same\npassword over and over again, so\n\n212\n00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:21.557\nI might say remember\nthe last five passwords and\n\n213\n00:10:21.557 --> 00:10:25.793\ndon't let them use the same one until it's\nbeen five times since they've done it.\n\n214\n00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:29.378\nSo these are examples of some of\nthe different things we can set, so\n\n215\n00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:31.435\nthat when people bring their device.\n\n216\n00:10:31.435 --> 00:10:35.852\nWe can at least apply some basic security\nprinciples to it and active sync,\n\n217\n00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:40.618\nin addition to connecting them to their\nmail will also enforce this policy yo make\n\n218\n00:10:40.618 --> 00:10:42.670\nsure they meet our requirements.\n\n219\n00:10:45.402 --> 00:10:46.770\nAll right,\nnow if I want somebody to connect,\n\n220\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.110\nit's pretty straight forward\nbecause it uses auto-discover.\n\n221\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.900\nSo I've got an Android tablet right here.\n\n222\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.230\nAnd so if I want to connect this Android\ntablet up to my Exchange environment I can\n\n223\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:00.130\njust go into my settings, and\nI can go down here to my accounts.\n\n224\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.110\nSo I'm gonna add an account and\nI'm gonna choose corporate.\n\n225\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.670\nNow some of them will\nactually say exchange,\n\n226\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.860\nsome say corporate,\nthere's different names there.\n\n227\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.400\nBut if I click on that you'll see here\nwe can set up an Exchange account.\n\n228\n00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.520\nAnd so I'm gonna connect this one to Jane.\n\n229\n00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:20.180\nSo, Jane is jsmith@itprotv.net,, and\nthen I can punch in her password.\n\n230\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.060\nNow, on an Outlook client if you\njoin to the active directory,\n\n231\n00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.720\nit can populate this information for us.\n\n232\n00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.200\nBut most phones aren't joined\nto our Active Directory.\n\n233\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.230\nSo, you're gonna have to type\nin a name and a password.\n\n234\n00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.040\nBut it's gonna use this name,\nthe domain name, to go out and\n\n235\n00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.150\ndo a DNS lookup to find\nthe servers to get connected.\n\n236\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.490\nAnd when it gets connected, it's gonna\ndownload that security policy first and\n\n237\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.130\napply the policy and\nthen it's gonna set up my email account.\n\n238\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.980\nSo when I hit next,\nit's reaching out to that server, and\n\n239\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.370\nit's trying to connect and so\nhere it's gathering that information.\n\n240\n00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.870\nNow, on mine it got it a little bit wrong,\nso I'm gonna have to correct some of this.\n\n241\n00:11:54.870 --> 00:12:00.690\nMy username is jsmith@itprotv.net.\n\n242\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.900\nMy password, my server name.\n\n243\n00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.170\nIt got that wrong for some reason,\nso I'll just have to punch that in.\n\n244\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.190\nI may not have configured\nall to discover here.\n\n245\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.162\nWe've got a secure SSL connection.\n\n246\n00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:15.300\nFor ActiveSync to work, we have to trust\nthe certificate on the other side.\n\n247\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.472\nIf we're using a self sign certificate or\na certificate\n\n248\n00:12:18.472 --> 00:12:22.460\nissued by a CA that our phones don't\ntrust, that can cause a problem.\n\n249\n00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.973\nSome phones are locked down by\nthe cell phone providers and\n\n250\n00:12:24.973 --> 00:12:27.743\nthey don't allow you to modify\nthe trusted root authorities and\n\n251\n00:12:27.743 --> 00:12:30.015\nthat means you can't trust\nyour own certificates.\n\n252\n00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:34.001\nSo fortunately, this one has an option\nthat says accept all SSL certificates and\n\n253\n00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:35.354\nthat'll let me use my own.\n\n254\n00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:38.232\nAll right, so\nwe can punch that information in and\n\n255\n00:12:38.232 --> 00:12:41.041\nthen next it's gonna reach\nout to that server and\n\n256\n00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:45.170\ntry and get us connected and\ncouldn't open connection to the servers.\n\n257\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.750\nSo, did I type it wrong?\n\n258\n00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.610\nLab dash cas01 dot itprotv dot net.\n\n259\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.430\nYou know what?\n\n260\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.480\nI'll just punch in the IP to\nsave me a little time here.\n\n261\n00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.570\nAnd we'll definitely\nget connected that way.\n\n262\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.350\nI'm not sure what DNS server this is\nusing, so it might not be looking me up.\n\n263\n00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.470\nThat might be, there we go,\nthat's why my auto discover didn't work.\n\n264\n00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.490\nI'm probably using the wrong DNS servers.\n\n265\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.270\nAll right, so\nhere I can see that I'm connected.\n\n266\n00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:09.290\nIt says it requires that I allow it\nto remotely control some features,\n\n267\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.640\nwhat does that mean?\n\n268\n00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.030\nWell, this is the security policy from\nActiveSync downloading to this device.\n\n269\n00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:20.030\nIf I say cancel, that refuses\nthe policy and I can't set up my email.\n\n270\n00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.750\nBut if I say okay.\n\n271\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.050\nI'm now accepting ActiveSync and\n\n272\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.770\nthat security policy is\ngoing to apply to my device.\n\n273\n00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.605\nI can see my inbox checking\nis set to push, right?\n\n274\n00:13:29.605 --> 00:13:32.800\nActiveSync gives me that\ndirect push technology and\n\n275\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.620\nit's gonna sync up a certain\namount of days, and\n\n276\n00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.562\nthen we can specify all the other settings\nthat I might wanna tweak for my mailbox.\n\n277\n00:13:38.562 --> 00:13:40.350\nAll right.\n\n278\n00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.660\nAfter that's done, here it is,\nthat's my account, and\n\n279\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.840\nI can see I've already got\nsome new email coming in.\n\n280\n00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.918\nI'm getting a warning here that I'm\nactivating the device administrator.\n\n281\n00:13:47.918 --> 00:13:52.510\nI'm giving ActiveSync permission to\nerase all data, set password rules,\n\n282\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.320\nlock the screen, and so on.\n\n283\n00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.820\nThis is that security policy applying,\nright?\n\n284\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.580\nWhen that's done,\nhere I'm taking my security screen,\n\n285\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.680\nthe security policy is\nrequiring me to set a PIN.\n\n286\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.870\nSo I need to go in and set a PIN,\nwhich I'll set right here.\n\n287\n00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.150\nI'm going super secure and\nsetting it to one, two, three, four, and\n\n288\n00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.400\nnow I've got a PIN.\n\n289\n00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.570\nSo when I lock my screen,\nin order to unlock it,\n\n290\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.760\nI'll have to punch in that PIN number.\n\n291\n00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.340\nRight?\nThere's that level security being enforced\n\n292\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.560\nby the exchange security policy.\n\n293\n00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.270\nAnd now when I go into my email\nclient I can go into email and\n\n294\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.070\nhere's my work email.\n\n295\n00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.210\nHere's that email that came in from\nthe administrator, and now I'm good to go.\n\n296\n00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.100\nI'm connected to my calendar and\nall those other things.\n\n297\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.980\nSo that's the first taste we get\nof mobile device management.\n\n298\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.610\nAt a minimum, we can use the mobile\ndevice security policies to manage\n\n299\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.290\nhow secure our systems are and to keep\nthem locked down so that if somebody is\n\n300\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:48.120\ngonna maintain a copy of our corporate\ne-mail it's at least under basic security.\n\n301\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.470\nIf they leave their phone\non a taxi cab somewhere,\n\n302\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.032\nwell I know it's at least got a PIN\nnumber and the screen is locked.\n\n303\n00:14:54.032 --> 00:14:59.220\nRight, so at a minimum we've got that but\nthere's a lot more we can do too.\n\n304\n00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.350\nFor example,\nnow that this is connected to ActiveSync,\n\n305\n00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.800\nwhat happens if this\nperson loses their phone?\n\n306\n00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.510\nIf they lose their phone,\nwe might wanna remote wipe it.\n\n307\n00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.410\nThere's two ways to remote wipe a phone.\n\n308\n00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.730\nThe administrators, we can do it.\n\n309\n00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.800\nWe can remote wipe any phone\nconnected to exchange.\n\n310\n00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.590\nThe end user can do it also though.\n\n311\n00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.920\nThey can wipe their own phone.\n\n312\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.600\nThey can actually do it\nthrough Outlook Web App.\n\n313\n00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.860\nIf they go to Outlook Web App and\ngo into their settings,\n\n314\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.650\nthey'll see their phones right there,\nand they can wipe their own phone or\n\n315\n00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.030\ntheir own tablet, this is a tablet here,\nthey can wipe their own device.\n\n316\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.200\nNow for remote wipe to work\nthe device has to be on, right?\n\n317\n00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.230\nWe've got to be able to send\nthe signal to it, but assuming it's on,\n\n318\n00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.210\nwe can get a signal to it and wipe it.\n\n319\n00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.010\nAs an administrator,\nit's actually pretty easy for us to do it.\n\n320\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.280\nI wanna see that.\n\n321\n00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.980\nWe can do a remote wipe on this one.\n\n322\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.798\nIf I go back to my Exchange administration\nsettings, or my Exchange admin center,\n\n323\n00:15:46.798 --> 00:15:50.553\nwe can jump in here, and if I go to my\nrecipients I can find the recipient.\n\n324\n00:15:50.553 --> 00:15:55.161\nSo Jane calls me, and she says, Don,\nI left my tablet on a taxicab and\n\n325\n00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:57.635\nI've got all sorts of data on there.\n\n326\n00:15:57.635 --> 00:15:59.648\nI don't know if I can get it back,\ncan we just wipe it?\n\n327\n00:15:59.648 --> 00:16:01.884\nAnd I say oh yeah give\nme just a minute Jane.\n\n328\n00:16:01.884 --> 00:16:05.190\nI can log into the EAC,\nI can find her account.\n\n329\n00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.005\nAnd if we edit here account you'll see\nsome different options here across\n\n330\n00:16:11.005 --> 00:16:14.419\nthe left, and if we look we can find our,\noh wait sorry.\n\n331\n00:16:14.419 --> 00:16:15.534\nI'm in the wrong spot.\n\n332\n00:16:15.534 --> 00:16:20.620\nIf we highlight Jane Smith over here\non the right side, if you scroll down.\n\n333\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.840\nIt's kinda buried away.\n\n334\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.530\nWe've got mobile devices, and\nthen you got view details right there.\n\n335\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.160\nThat's where we need to go to\nactually see her mobile devices.\n\n336\n00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.360\nI know it's kinda counter-intuitive.\n\n337\n00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.260\nI always want to pull up\nthe properties of her account.\n\n338\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.070\nBut the devices are nested over here.\n\n339\n00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.010\nSo if I go to view details,\nit's gonna pull it up and\n\n340\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.240\nthere I can see her Android device, right?\n\n341\n00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.820\nThere's here Android tablet.\n\n342\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.040\nI can see that it's been\ngranted access to the system.\n\n343\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.530\nIt's active right now but she lost it and\nif she had more than one device,\n\n344\n00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.320\nI'd see them all right here in the list.\n\n345\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.280\nThis is also where I could\nchange her security policy.\n\n346\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.090\nIf I wanted her to have a different policy\nthan the default, I could browse and\n\n347\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.930\nchange it right here too.\n\n348\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.720\nBut in this case she lost her device.\n\n349\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.410\nAnd if you look up here at the options\nyou'll see where we can do things like\n\n350\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.650\nblock the device.\n\n351\n00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:00.980\nMaybe I don't want to wipe it.\n\n352\n00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.080\nI just want to stop it from accessing\nour system until she finds it.\n\n353\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.270\nAnd then when she finds it\nI can re enable it again.\n\n354\n00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.790\nSo you can hit block.\n\n355\n00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:08.700\nand she finds the device and\n\n356\n00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.440\nI come and re-enable, well that's\nwhat you want to do at the minimum.\n\n357\n00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.750\nBut as we look you can see wipe data, and\nthat's what we want to do if the phone is\n\n358\n00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.910\nlost, and\nwe don't think we're going to get it back.\n\n359\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.440\nOr, if it's got sensitive data, and I just\nwant to erase it before the battery dies.\n\n360\n00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.210\nBecause the battery will die eventually,\n\n361\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.030\neven if it's just sitting\nthere on a park bench.\n\n362\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.150\nSo, I'm going to hit that button, and\nit's going to tell me we are going to\n\n363\n00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.240\nwipe that device, just going to reach\nout and knock that out and clear it.\n\n364\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.980\nSo I'll go ahead and say OK to that, and\n\n365\n00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.760\nit's now sending a wipe\nping to that system.\n\n366\n00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.200\nSo see how it says wipe pending?\n\n367\n00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.450\nIt sent the ping to the other system and\nit's saying hey,\n\n368\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.860\nyou need to erase yourself.\n\n369\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.890\nNow if the other system is off.\n\n370\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.570\nMaybe whoever's got the phone\nturned off the wireless,\n\n371\n00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.090\nthe signal is not gonna get there.\n\n372\n00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.920\nSo it's gonna keep trying,\nit's gonna keep trying over and over and\n\n373\n00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.240\nover again forever.\n\n374\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.510\nIt's just gonna keep\ntrying until we stop it.\n\n375\n00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:59.688\nThat way if the device ever does come back\nonline, it'll receive that message, and\n\n376\n00:17:59.688 --> 00:18:01.180\nit'll wipe.\n\n377\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.580\nMeanwhile, if I go back to the device,\nthings just look like normal.\n\n378\n00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.970\nAnd what's gonna happen is this\ndevice is gonna receive that ping.\n\n379\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.690\nAnd as soon as that happens it's\ngonna reboot and erase itself.\n\n380\n00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.800\nIt's gonna wipe itself,\nclear the data and then we're safe.\n\n381\n00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.520\nSo as an admin we can do\nit right here centrally.\n\n382\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.820\nAs a user they can do it\nthrough Outlook web app.\n\n383\n00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.890\nJust log into OWA and go into their\nsettings and they can knock it out there.\n\n384\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.840\nAll right.\n\n385\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.460\nA couple other things that we need to\nthink about with mobile devices like this.\n\n386\n00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.770\nWhen I went under my EAC and\n\n387\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.890\nI went to mobile, you'll notice\nthere was this mobile device access.\n\n388\n00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:36.280\nWhat's that all about?\n\n389\n00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.600\nWell, by default,\nif you enable Exchange Active Sync for\n\n390\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.310\na user, they can connect any\nmobile device they want.\n\n391\n00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.880\nIt's turned on for them,\nthey can connect whenever.\n\n392\n00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.430\nSo, they might have iPhones and iPads,\nthey might have Windows mobile phones,\n\n393\n00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:53.000\nthey might have Android Phones, tablets,\nwhatever they're connecting it all.\n\n394\n00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.850\nThey can go crazy, but\nwe know that some devices\n\n395\n00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.680\nthat some devices might be more secure\nthan others and in our IT department,\n\n396\n00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.100\nwe might only want to\nsupport certain devices.\n\n397\n00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:07.980\nMaybe you tell your employees, alright,\nwe're gonna support any Nokia Lumia Phone.\n\n398\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.840\nAnd we'll support any iPhone but\n\n399\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.120\nwe'll only support Samsung Android\nphones and that's it.\n\n400\n00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.200\nWell, what if somebody goes and\nthey get a Nexus, or\n\n401\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.310\nthey get some other kind of phone and\nthey want to hook it up.\n\n402\n00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.360\nWell, by default, they can.\n\n403\n00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.810\nThere's nothing stopping them.\n\n404\n00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.930\nBut, we can create access settings.\n\n405\n00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.900\nAccess settings that let us pick and\nchoose which phones and\n\n406\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.420\ndevices get approved.\n\n407\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.620\nSo you'll see the two\ndifferent options we've got.\n\n408\n00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.640\nOption one is to set up a quarantine.\n\n409\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.740\nA quarantine is, we say anyone can\nconnect a phone, but it's gonna go into\n\n410\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:43.020\nthe quarantine until I decide\nwhether to approve it or decline it.\n\n411\n00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.180\nSo this will pool up, and as an admin\nyou'll have to go in once a day or\n\n412\n00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.410\nhowever often, and\nchoose to approve phones.\n\n413\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.840\nAnd now,\nit's you controlling what devices get in.\n\n414\n00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.530\nOption two is you can define access rules\nthat specifically state types of hardware,\n\n415\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.040\ntypes of devices that you want to allow.\n\n416\n00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.630\nI'll add a rule here, so\nyou can see an example.\n\n417\n00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.180\nWhen I create device access,\nyou can specify a device family.\n\n418\n00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.150\nAnd so I can browse and pick that family.\n\n419\n00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.780\nNow all families is kind of the default.\n\n420\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.320\nAs we create our own families\nin here we'll start to see more.\n\n421\n00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.800\nRight now I've just got\nthat one set to all.\n\n422\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.100\nSo I'll say all families, and\nthen you can specify particular models.\n\n423\n00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.860\nNow I don't have any models defined\nin my system so that's blank for me.\n\n424\n00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.590\nSo this one is basically\ngoing to be everything.\n\n425\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:29.410\nAnd here's where we can say allow access,\nblock access, or quarantine access.\n\n426\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.770\nAnd if we want to quarantine,\n\n427\n00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.550\nthat means they can connect, it'll go into\nquarantine, and then we have to go in and\n\n428\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.230\nactually approve that\nto be able to connect.\n\n429\n00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.730\nThey'll just end up right there.\n\n430\n00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.690\nOtherwise, we can specify\nparticular models.\n\n431\n00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.810\nAnd once that's done, we can say,\nall right, if it's an iPhone or\n\n432\n00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.330\niOS, we allow it.\n\n433\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.740\nOr if it's a Nokia Lumina, we allow it.\n\n434\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.790\nOr I can say Nokia Luminas,\nand then specific models,\n\n435\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.230\nmaybe I just want the 520 and\n920 and that's it.\n\n436\n00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.920\nSo we can punch those in and it'll\napprove those, or I just want Android,\n\n437\n00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.150\nNexus, and Samsung Galaxy's.\n\n438\n00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.180\nYou punch those in.\n\n439\n00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.450\nSo you can be really specific to\ndictate which devices are supported\n\n440\n00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:07.990\nin your environment.\n\n441\n00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.350\nNow, this list is empty by default.\n\n442\n00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.920\nSo I don't really have any\ndevice families or models.\n\n443\n00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.470\nAnd if you click the learn more link,\nit'll take you to Microsoft site.\n\n444\n00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.350\nAnd they explain how to add more in.\n\n445\n00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.450\nAnd when it comes to adding these in,\nthe reason they don't put them in there\n\n446\n00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.330\nautomatically is that\nthey change all the time.\n\n447\n00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.600\nThere's new devices being\nreleased all the time.\n\n448\n00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.540\nAnd so you gotta put them in based\non their hardware identifiers so\n\n449\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.390\nthat you can recognize it.\n\n450\n00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.990\nSo they kind of walk you through\nthat process of getting them added.\n\n451\n00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.890\nBut it is a neat function of\nExchange Active Sync to be able to limit\n\n452\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.649\nthe types of devices that can connect.\n\n453\n00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.740\nAnd then like I said on the mobile device\npolicies we can always create more than\n\n454\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.460\none policy.\n\n455\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.930\nAs you add more policies in, you dictate\nwhat that policy is going to be.\n\n456\n00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.930\nAnd then you can attach\nthat to different people.\n\n457\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.160\nYou can use the PowerShell\nto apply to entire OU's.\n\n458\n00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.760\nSo different departments\nhave different settings.\n\n459\n00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.080\nThere's a lot of flexibility there.\n\n460\n00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.750\nSo this is a fully featured mobile\ndevice management MDM suite.\n\n461\n00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:05.520\nThe only thing that it doesn't do is it\ndoesn't give us the ability to install\n\n462\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.920\napps on people's phones, or\nuninstall apps on people's phones.\n\n463\n00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.240\nWe didn't see that.\n\n464\n00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.540\nFor that we need a full MDM suite, and\n\n465\n00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.180\nthere's plenty of third party\nproviders out there for that.\n\n466\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.400\nBut most people don't need\nthat level of functionality.\n\n467\n00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.000\nOn a bring your own device,\n\n468\n00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.090\nwe typically want end users to still be\nable to run their own applications right.\n\n469\n00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.520\nIt's their device, they paid for it.\n\n470\n00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.770\nThey might still wanna install their\nown apps, so we leave that be.\n\n471\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.470\nWe just wanna make sure that the device\nis at least secured with a PIN and\n\n472\n00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.630\npassword to be able to secure the system.\n\n473\n00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.690\nSo that's basically the key components\nthere of that mobile device.\n\n474\n00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:41.090\nNow, other than that, that's basically\nit for mobile device management.\n\n475\n00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.200\nJust be aware that it\ndoes use auto-discover.\n\n476\n00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.920\nSo we gotta make sure that\nauto-discover is configured.\n\n477\n00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.970\nIf you haven't already, check out our,\ntwo part auto-discover episode that we did\n\n478\n00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.270\nthat kind of covered how\nto get that configured.\n\n479\n00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.050\nAll mobile devices\nare treated as external,\n\n480\n00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.380\nbecause they're not joined to your domain.\n\n481\n00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.320\nSo their gonna look for DNS, And\nfind your servers that way, so\n\n482\n00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.650\nmake sure that you've got that.\n\n483\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.550\nAlso be aware of the problem\nthat I ran into where\n\n484\n00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.010\nI didn't know what DNS my phone was using.\n\n485\n00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.840\nIt was on a different network, so\nI had to punch in my server by IP.\n\n486\n00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.470\nThat's not ideal, right?\n\n487\n00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.540\nWe wanna make sure that our DNS\nnames are able to be looked up from\n\n488\n00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.780\noutside of the network.\n\n489\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.075\nSo you gotta make sure your\nDNS structure is proper.\n\n490\n00:23:17.075 --> 00:23:20.330\nBut other than that you've got an MDM\nin place and you're ready to rock.\n\n491\n00:23:21.412 --> 00:23:24.630\nAll right well in this episode we got a\nchance to see the mobile device management\n\n492\n00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:25.520\ninside of Exchange.\n\n493\n00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.120\nWe saw how to add a mobile device.\n\n494\n00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.640\nWe saw how to create a security policy and\nhow to remote wipe a device.\n\n495\n00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.160\nSo we got a chance to see some of those\ndifferent settings and how they function.\n\n496\n00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.100\nAnd all in all not too painful.\n\n497\n00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.570\nSo definitely a cool feature.\n\n498\n00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.040\nOne you'll want to make use of\nout there in the real world.\n\n499\n00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.870\nAll right well I hope you\nguys enjoyed the episode.\n\n500\n00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:46.481\nsigning off for ITProTV I'm Don Pizette\nand I'll see you next time.\n\n501\n00:23:46.481 --> 00:23:52.620\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.876\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:15.877\nI'm your host,\n\n5\n00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:20.490\nDon Pezet back again with another\nepisode of Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.990\nIn this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.610\nwe're gonna be taking a look at how to\nmake client access servers redundant.\n\n8\n00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.180\nNow that's really important to us,\n\n9\n00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.980\nbecause client access servers are kinda\nthe front face, what our end users see.\n\n10\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.000\nWhen they fire up Microsoft Outlook,\nwhen they go to Outlook Web App,\n\n11\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.280\nwhen they want to access their email,\nthey talk to a client access server.\n\n12\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.470\nNow the client access server's turning\naround and talking to a mailbox server.\n\n13\n00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.870\nAnd the mailbox servers\nneed to be redundant too.\n\n14\n00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.450\nBut the way we make them redundant\nis through what's called a database\n\n15\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.370\navailability group.\n\n16\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.520\nWe'll have a separate\nepisode that covers that.\n\n17\n00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.230\nBut for this episode,\nwe wanna cover Client Access Servers.\n\n18\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.239\nNow Client Access Servers are kind of\nunique because they don't really have\n\n19\n00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.220\nany data.\n\n20\n00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.600\nWhen a user connects, they connect\nto the Client Access Server, and\n\n21\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.310\nit proxies them back to the right mailbox\nserver, to where the real data is.\n\n22\n00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.440\nSo at the end of the day,\n\n23\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.800\na client doesn't really care which\nClient Access Server they connect to.\n\n24\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.820\nThey do care about which mailbox server.\n\n25\n00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.739\nBecause if they connect to a mailbox\nserver that doesn't have their mailbox,\n\n26\n00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:19.028\nthey're not gonna see any email.\n\n27\n00:01:19.028 --> 00:01:21.770\nBut they can connect to any\nClient Access Server and\n\n28\n00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.269\nit will send them to\nthe right mailbox server.\n\n29\n00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:27.561\nSo on a Client Access Server the easiest\nway to make them redundant is to have\n\n30\n00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:28.390\nmore than one.\n\n31\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.138\nYou just bring up more than one\nClient Access Server now you've redundant.\n\n32\n00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:35.635\nThe only problem with that is it's not\nlike an automatic failover, right?\n\n33\n00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:37.225\nTake my example here.\n\n34\n00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:40.325\nIn my system,\nI've got two exchange servers, right?\n\n35\n00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:43.105\nI've got Exchange Server 01 and\nExchange Server 02.\n\n36\n00:01:43.105 --> 00:01:47.132\nIf I go to my server list here they're\nboth client axis servers, right?\n\n37\n00:01:47.132 --> 00:01:49.782\nSo I know that I could\nfire up a web browser and\n\n38\n00:01:49.782 --> 00:01:54.862\nI could point to lab-EXCHSERV01 and\nget into OWA.\n\n39\n00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:57.472\nAnd in fact,\nI'm logged into with OWA right here.\n\n40\n00:01:57.472 --> 00:02:04.050\nBut just the same, I could point to\nlab-EXCHSERV02 and log into OWA.\n\n41\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.220\nHere, I'm logged in as Jane Smith\non this one but same thing, right?\n\n42\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.290\nIt doesn't really matter which\nClient Axis Server I connect to.\n\n43\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.670\nSo rule number one for\n\n44\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.450\nredundancy with a Client Axis Server\nis just to have more that one, right?\n\n45\n00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.710\nYou should always have two or\nmore for that redundancy.\n\n46\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.650\nBut if Server 1 were to fail,\nif it goes offline,\n\n47\n00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.900\nas an end user I would browse to it and\nI would get a failed connect.\n\n48\n00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.440\nThen I would have to know\nto switch to Server 2.\n\n49\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.135\nWell, what if I would want\nto make that automatic?\n\n50\n00:02:31.135 --> 00:02:32.629\nWe can do that.\nWe can do that and\n\n51\n00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.420\nactually done really easy.\n\n52\n00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.500\nIt's not like we have to set\nup some crazy cluster or\n\n53\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.030\nhave shared storage or anything.\n\n54\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.740\nWe can set up what's called\nWindows Load Balancing Services, WLBS, or\n\n55\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.105\nNetwork Load Balancing, NLB.\n\n56\n00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:46.290\nThere's two different names for it.\n\n57\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.820\nYou'll see it written different\nways on Microsoft's website.\n\n58\n00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.170\nOn the exam they'll call it\nNetwork Load Balancing or NLB.\n\n59\n00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.140\nWith Network Load Balancing, we create\na virtual server, like a fake server.\n\n60\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.960\nThe clients go to the fake server and\n\n61\n00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.670\nit then directs them to\nthe real servers behind it.\n\n62\n00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.300\nSo now I can have a fake server and\n\n63\n00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.920\npeople don't have to remember that they're\nconnecting to server number two or\n\n64\n00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.410\nserver number one,\nthey connect to the fake server.\n\n65\n00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.150\nLet me show you how it works,\nit's really not that hard.\n\n66\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.300\nWe're gonna start here\non one of our servers.\n\n67\n00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.670\nAnd so here I am on Lab-Exchserv01.\n\n68\n00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.409\nDoesn't really matter\nwhich one I start on,\n\n69\n00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.350\nbecause at the end of the day they're\nall gonna get balanced, right?\n\n70\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.910\nBut I'm gonna start on Server 01, and\nI'm gonna go up here to Manage, and\n\n71\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.460\nI'm gonna do Add Roles and Features.\n\n72\n00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.880\nAnd what we're gonna do is just add\nthe Network Load Balancing feature.\n\n73\n00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.870\nWhen you move through the setup here,\n\n74\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.870\nit's gonna offer to install\nvarious roles on our server.\n\n75\n00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.650\nAnd we'll have the option\ninstall features and\n\n76\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.490\nwhen you look at the rolls the low\nbalancing is not in there.\n\n77\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.180\nBut when you get into the features\nyou can skim down the list and\n\n78\n00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.180\nin here you'll find\nNetwork Load Balancing.\n\n79\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.680\nNow we're going to use it for\nExchange Client Access.\n\n80\n00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.970\nBut you could use it for anything.\n\n81\n00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.670\nIt works with IIS, Remote Desktop like\nif you're setting up terminal servers.\n\n82\n00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.110\nYou can load balance any traffic\nwith Network Load Balancing.\n\n83\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.810\nWe just want to use it for\nour Client Access Servers.\n\n84\n00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.100\nSo I'm going to choose that\nNetwork Load Balancing and\n\n85\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.480\nI'm going to add that feature.\n\n86\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.400\nNow, once its installed we'll\nhave the ability to set up a load\n\n87\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.660\nbalancing cluster, which is a very simple\nform of cluster that just directs traffic\n\n88\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.540\nbetween these nodes.\n\n89\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.180\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nget these installed.\n\n90\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.820\nNow, technically, I don't have to install,\nand it'll be on the second node.\n\n91\n00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.990\nWhen I go to set it up,\nit'll push the settings over to it.\n\n92\n00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.420\nBut it does make things go\na little bit faster to do it.\n\n93\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.950\nSo I'm gonna jump over to my second\nnode and do the same thing over here.\n\n94\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.413\nI'm just gonna go to add roles and\nfeatures and\n\n95\n00:04:32.413 --> 00:04:34.316\nI'm gonna add in that NLB feature.\n\n96\n00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:37.870\nBut like I said, I don't technically\nhave to do this, it would do it for me.\n\n97\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.750\nI just want to speed things up a little\nbit, so I'm gonna add that feature and\n\n98\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.490\nget that installed here.\n\n99\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.390\nNow as part of that feature it's\ninstalling the management tools for\n\n100\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.730\nNLB and that's what I really need.\n\n101\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.160\nI can go into the management tools and\nI can define a new load balancing cluster.\n\n102\n00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.440\nAnd when I define that new cluster\nI point to the servers and\n\n103\n00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.540\nif they don't have NLB installed it\nwill install it there for me, right.\n\n104\n00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.870\nIt just takes time.\n\n105\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.685\nAnd then it sets up the various\nother settings to make it balanced.\n\n106\n00:05:03.685 --> 00:05:06.290\nSo that's what I'm doing right\nhere is getting that installed.\n\n107\n00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.605\nSo there we go, we got it.\n\n108\n00:05:07.605 --> 00:05:11.958\nOnce you've got it installed in your\nserver manager, you can go to tools and\n\n109\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:17.320\nunder tools you'll have the Network\nLoad Balancing Manager, or NLB manager.\n\n110\n00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.380\nAnd we can fire that up, and\n\n111\n00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.800\nthat's where we go to configure\nNLB clusters, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.150\nI'm gonna call it a cluster, and\nI know people get a little paranoid or\n\n113\n00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.440\npanicky on that one, cuz clusters\nare notoriously difficult to set up.\n\n114\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.919\nYou'll see that this type of cluster\nis actually really easy to set up.\n\n115\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.770\nSo the first thing I'll notice is that\nunder Network Load Balancing clusters,\n\n116\n00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.320\nI don't have any.\n\n117\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.980\nIt's just kinda empty, so\nI need to create a new one.\n\n118\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.100\nAnd I'm just gonna right-click on that and\nchoose New Cluster.\n\n119\n00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.100\nAnd now we can define a host.\n\n120\n00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.780\nWe need to connect to one host and\n\n121\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.200\nit's gonna be the person\nwho starts the cluster.\n\n122\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.740\nAnd it doesn't really matter who I pick.\n\n123\n00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.950\nI could pick node 1, node 2, whatever.\n\n124\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.610\n'Cause at the end of the day I'm going to\nadd the other nodes and it all balances,\n\n125\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.382\nbut I'm going to start with\nmy lab-exchserve01, and\n\n126\n00:05:59.382 --> 00:06:02.680\nI'll hit connect, and\nit's going to connect up to that server.\n\n127\n00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.907\nAnd see what it's pulling here,\nthe IP address of that server.\n\n128\n00:06:04.907 --> 00:06:08.290\nThat server is 192.168.0.911.\n\n129\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.020\nThat IP address is important.\n\n130\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.420\nNow, when we do Network Load Balancing,\n\n131\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.070\nit's a good idea to have\nmultiple network adapters.\n\n132\n00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.120\nNow, I've only got one network adapter\nin mine, so that's all it's showing.\n\n133\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.470\nIf I had more than one network adapter,\nthey would show up here.\n\n134\n00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.530\nNow, why is it important to have\nmore than one network adapter?\n\n135\n00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.142\nWell, if I wanna remotely manage\none node in this cluster,\n\n136\n00:06:27.142 --> 00:06:30.914\nI don't wanna connect to node 2,\nI wanna connect to node 1.\n\n137\n00:06:30.914 --> 00:06:33.161\nWell if they've all got\na shared connection,\n\n138\n00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:35.360\nhow do I know which one\nI'm gonna connect to?\n\n139\n00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.430\nI'm gonna get balanced,\nI might connect to different ones.\n\n140\n00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.200\nSo by having a dedicated adapter for\nmanagement purposes,\n\n141\n00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.270\nit makes it really easy to manage that.\n\n142\n00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.680\nI don't have to have the second adapter,\nbut it is generally a good idea.\n\n143\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.470\nBut I'm gonna stick with this one and\nI'll go ahead and move forward.\n\n144\n00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.980\nIf I had more than one, I'd be picking\nthe one that was gonna be used for\n\n145\n00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:51.620\nconfiguration.\n\n146\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.840\nAll right.\n\n147\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.100\nThen it's listing the cluster information,\nI have to set a priority.\n\n148\n00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.860\nIn a cluster, you always have a master.\n\n149\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.840\nSomebody is the main node in that cluster,\nand it picks that based on a priority.\n\n150\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.450\nThe first node you add is priority one,\n\n151\n00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.550\nthe second node is priority two,\nand so on.\n\n152\n00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.780\nBut you might have one server that's maybe\nbetter hardware than the others, and\n\n153\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.000\nyou want that to be the primary.\n\n154\n00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.600\nSo you could set it's priority to one, and\nyou'll see that it goes from one to 32.\n\n155\n00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.070\nAnd that's our first indicator that\nwhen we build a Load Balancing Cluster,\n\n156\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.400\nwe have a maximum of 32 nodes, right?\n\n157\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.649\nSo you can have up to 32 client access\nservers that you're balancing across.\n\n158\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.620\nThen it's got the dedicated IP address for\n\n159\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.920\nthis system, 192.68.0.11,\nI'm fine with that.\n\n160\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.860\nAnd my initial host state is started.\n\n161\n00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.340\nWhen this system comes up, it's gonna\nstart up, it's not gonna go into standby.\n\n162\n00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.940\nNow this dedicated IP address, that's\nthe dedicated IP address of this node.\n\n163\n00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.480\nI'm gonna have a shared\nIP address in a minute.\n\n164\n00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.620\nThat'll be the virtual one,\n\n165\n00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.370\nthe one that's shared across all the nodes\nthat my clients are gonna connect to.\n\n166\n00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.600\nAnd here on this next screen is\nwhere I pick that shared IP.\n\n167\n00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.191\nIt's gonna create basically like\na fake server on the network.\n\n168\n00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:01.611\nAnd our clients are gonna\nconnect to that fake server.\n\n169\n00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:04.691\nSo this is the shared IP that's\ngonna bounce between my nodes.\n\n170\n00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:05.951\nI'm gonna go and hit add.\n\n171\n00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:07.611\nAnd I'll punch in an IP address.\n\n172\n00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:11.517\nNow it needs to be an IP that's\nin the same range as my nodes, so\n\n173\n00:08:11.517 --> 00:08:12.920\nthey can see it.\n\n174\n00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.316\nSo, I'm gonna give mine 192.168.0.222.\n\n175\n00:08:16.316 --> 00:08:21.380\nMy individual node was 192.168.0.11,\nso it'll be able to see this.\n\n176\n00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.583\nAnd it's subnet mask, I could do\na IPv6 balancerm if I wanted to.\n\n177\n00:08:25.583 --> 00:08:27.630\nBut in my case, I'm gonna do IPv4.\n\n178\n00:08:31.213 --> 00:08:35.085\nAnd we had a question in the chat room\nabout if you had a single interface,\n\n179\n00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:36.496\ncould you add a second IP?\n\n180\n00:08:36.496 --> 00:08:38.980\nWell, you could, but\nyou actually don't have to.\n\n181\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.834\nMy node is gonna keep\nthe 192.168.0.11 address.\n\n182\n00:08:42.834 --> 00:08:45.314\nSo in the future,\nif I wanna manage this one node,\n\n183\n00:08:45.314 --> 00:08:49.290\nI could always connect in on that\n.11 address, it will still have it.\n\n184\n00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.163\nIf I connect to .222, I'll get balance.\n\n185\n00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:54.480\nI don't know where I'm gonna go, but\n.11 will always send me to this one node.\n\n186\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.017\nI just have to remember the IP and you\ncould create DNS entries to take care of\n\n187\n00:08:58.017 --> 00:09:00.668\nthat, there's a number of\nways to get around that too.\n\n188\n00:09:00.668 --> 00:09:03.400\nSo .222, that's gonna be my shared one.\n\n189\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.483\nAnd I'll move forward and here,\nit's got that configuration for me and\n\n190\n00:09:08.483 --> 00:09:10.495\nI need to give it a Full Internet name.\n\n191\n00:09:10.495 --> 00:09:11.868\nIt's gonna be a fake server.\n\n192\n00:09:11.868 --> 00:09:14.510\nSo it's gonna have to have a DNS entry,\nso people can find it and\n\n193\n00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.930\nI need to give it a full name.\n\n194\n00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:23.050\nWell, my servers are called lab-exchserv\nand then a number to identify the node.\n\n195\n00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.079\nThis is gonna be the core\nof my cluster though, so\n\n196\n00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:26.669\nI'm just gonna leave the number off.\n\n197\n00:09:26.669 --> 00:09:32.258\nThis'll be lab-exchserv, but\nnotice it wants a full name,\n\n198\n00:09:32.258 --> 00:09:35.490\nso I need to add .lab.itpro.tv.\n\n199\n00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.653\nI need to add that, so it knows its full\ndomain name and I'm gonna have to go and\n\n200\n00:09:39.653 --> 00:09:42.270\ncreate a DNS entry for\nthis here in a minute.\n\n201\n00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.543\nThat points to 192.168.0.222.\n\n202\n00:09:46.543 --> 00:09:50.089\nNow when you set up load balancing,\nthere's three different modes that it can\n\n203\n00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:53.085\noperate in and\nthey each kinda have their pros and cons.\n\n204\n00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:55.191\nUnicast mode is really the preferred one,\nbut\n\n205\n00:09:55.191 --> 00:09:57.520\nit generates a little more\ntraffic on the network.\n\n206\n00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.154\nBasically, when somebody\nconnects to 192.168.222,\n\n207\n00:10:01.154 --> 00:10:03.449\nthe load balancer's gonna look at that and\n\n208\n00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:08.010\nit's gonna evenly distribute the user\nacross all the servers in the cluster.\n\n209\n00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.080\nSo if there's two servers in the cluster,\n\n210\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.630\nit'll send 50% of the traffic\nto 1 node and 50% to the other.\n\n211\n00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.505\nIt doesn't wanna have to load balance\nevery single packet from that client,\n\n212\n00:10:19.505 --> 00:10:24.380\nso what it does in unicast mode is it\nactually tells that client the MAC address\n\n213\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.713\nof a particular node in the cluster.\n\n214\n00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:29.433\nSo from now on,\nthey'll just go straight to that node.\n\n215\n00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:31.360\nThat's normally what we want.\n\n216\n00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.080\nBut if a node fails, we\n\n217\n00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.860\nmight have cached MAC addresses that take\na little while to flip over to the other.\n\n218\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.140\nSo unicast is very reliable, but\n\n219\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.330\nit doesn't necessarily failover\nas fast as some of the others.\n\n220\n00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.587\nMulticast and IGMP Multicast,\nthese two, they failover instantly.\n\n221\n00:10:48.587 --> 00:10:51.654\nYou have this one multicast\naddress you go to and\n\n222\n00:10:51.654 --> 00:10:55.411\nthen the nodes can pick up that\ntraffic and receive it, but\n\n223\n00:10:55.411 --> 00:11:00.670\nnot every switch and not every router\nallows us to do IGMP traffic across it.\n\n224\n00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.643\nSo if IGMP is not supported on your\nnetwork, you'll need to do unicast.\n\n225\n00:11:03.643 --> 00:11:07.048\nUnicast always works, but\nthe failover time might be five,\n\n226\n00:11:07.048 --> 00:11:10.380\nten seconds and\nI know that doesn't sound like a lot.\n\n227\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.045\nBut if you have really critical\nsoftware and that's too much time,\n\n228\n00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:16.049\nthen you don't wanna go that route.\n\n229\n00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:19.973\nWell, for a client access server,\nwe're talking about Outlook Web App,\n\n230\n00:11:19.973 --> 00:11:21.860\nwhich is just HTTP traffic.\n\n231\n00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.252\nWe might be talking about POP3 or\nIMAP4 and all of those can handle a 10 or\n\n232\n00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:29.334\n15 second outage,\nthat's not a big deal to them.\n\n233\n00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:32.550\nSo I'm gonna stick to unicast,\nbecause it's the most reliable.\n\n234\n00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:37.310\nNow, the big decision.\n\n235\n00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.680\nIf I have two network adapters,\none for management and one for\n\n236\n00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.210\nthe cluster,\nI can leave it at the default.\n\n237\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.950\nThe default is,\nit's gonna load balance all traffic.\n\n238\n00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.960\nAnything that I send to 192.168.0.222\nwill get balanced across these nodes and\n\n239\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.280\noff we go.\n\n240\n00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.010\nAnd it's an easy config,\nI just leave it at the default.\n\n241\n00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.557\nBut if I've only got one network adapter,\n\n242\n00:12:00.557 --> 00:12:03.688\nI need to be careful about\nwhat I'm load balancing.\n\n243\n00:12:03.688 --> 00:12:05.860\nI don't necessarily want\nto load balance everything.\n\n244\n00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:11.110\nAnd so we can take this rule and delete it\nand add new ones or change it and specify\n\n245\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.510\nexactly what we want to load balance and\nthen leave everything else off.\n\n246\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.363\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna add a new rule and\n\n247\n00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.729\nI'm gonna specify what I'm balancing.\n\n248\n00:12:20.729 --> 00:12:22.769\nNow, it's asking for what IP address.\n\n249\n00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:25.620\nIf your cluster has more than one IP,\nyou can pick from those here.\n\n250\n00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.044\nBut in my case, I've only got one IP.\n\n251\n00:12:27.044 --> 00:12:30.050\nSo, I'm not gonna worry about that and\nthen I specify the port ranges.\n\n252\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.444\nNow, we need to think about\nwhat we're balancing.\n\n253\n00:12:33.444 --> 00:12:36.608\nOn a client access server,\nwhat do you have?\n\n254\n00:12:36.608 --> 00:12:38.460\nWell, you have Outlook Web App.\n\n255\n00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.638\nAnd maybe the Exchange Control Panel or\nthe Exchange Admin Center,\n\n256\n00:12:41.638 --> 00:12:43.208\na couple other things like that.\n\n257\n00:12:43.208 --> 00:12:46.225\nThey all run on port 80 and port 443.\n\n258\n00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:50.958\n80 is unsecure and Exchange will\nactually do a redirect over to secure.\n\n259\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:55.875\nSo I'm gonna add a rule that says,\nI load balance port 80 and it's just TCP.\n\n260\n00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:58.779\nYou could say, if it was TCP and\nUDP or if it was both,\n\n261\n00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:03.270\nyou can specify that there and\nthen you can specify a filtering mode.\n\n262\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:08.250\nNow the default filtering mode is\nthat we have multiple hosts, but\n\n263\n00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.110\nwe're gonna try and\nconnect somebody to a single host.\n\n264\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.120\nAnd when they reconnect,\nthey're gonna stay on that host.\n\n265\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.087\nYou don't want every time\nsomebody clicks on a page for\n\n266\n00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:18.366\nthem to jump over to another host,\ntheir session would reset.\n\n267\n00:13:18.366 --> 00:13:20.590\nThey'd have to re log in,\nwe don't want that.\n\n268\n00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.019\nSo instead, we want them always to go back\nto the same node unless that node fails.\n\n269\n00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:25.850\nSo we've got single affinity.\n\n270\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.015\nWhen you connect, you hit that node and\nyou stay on that node for\n\n271\n00:13:29.015 --> 00:13:31.488\nthe rest of your session,\nbut you can change it.\n\n272\n00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:34.640\nYou can balance it based on network,\nyou can set a timeout.\n\n273\n00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.610\nWe can manipulate how that\nfunctions if we want, but\n\n274\n00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.913\nthe default here is to go multiple host.\n\n275\n00:13:39.913 --> 00:13:42.810\nNow you can do single host,\nyou can disable the port range.\n\n276\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.159\nThere's a couple other mechanisms there,\nbut the default is typically what we want.\n\n277\n00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.680\nSo, I'm just doing port 80 and\nthen I'm gonna come back in and\n\n278\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.620\nadd a few other things.\n\n279\n00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.679\nNow it's gonna warn me, it's overlapping\nwith that role that we've already got.\n\n280\n00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:54.080\nSo, I need to get rid of that role role.\n\n281\n00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.510\nI can just edit that role and change it.\n\n282\n00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:01.018\nI can just change this one to be port 80\nand then add in my other roles as needed.\n\n283\n00:14:01.018 --> 00:14:07.155\nSo there's 80 and then I'll need to do\nthe same thing for 443 and punch that in.\n\n284\n00:14:07.155 --> 00:14:11.433\nSo that's gonna take care of OWA and the\nExchange Admin Center and all those guys,\n\n285\n00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:13.357\nI need to think about my other ports.\n\n286\n00:14:13.357 --> 00:14:18.596\nIf I'm doing POP3 or IMAP4,\nit might be port 110 or\n\n287\n00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:22.731\n143, port 597, port 25 for SMTP.\n\n288\n00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:24.599\nAll those other ports that we use,\n\n289\n00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:28.100\nI would wanna add in the ones\nthat I'm load balancing.\n\n290\n00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.195\nAnything that's not in this list If\nsomebody goes to my shared IP on a port\n\n291\n00:14:31.195 --> 00:14:34.109\nless non-list, the traffic just\ngets thrown away and that's it.\n\n292\n00:14:34.109 --> 00:14:37.080\nSo, it's almost like\na mini firewall in a way.\n\n293\n00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.521\nSo, I'm just gonna add in\nmy web traffic for now.\n\n294\n00:14:40.521 --> 00:14:43.568\nYou guys know,\nyou can add in other ports as you need it.\n\n295\n00:14:43.568 --> 00:14:46.120\nThat's gonna create my cluster.\n\n296\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.956\nNow I've got a one node cluster, which\nis pretty much completely useless, but\n\n297\n00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:53.409\nit is gonna create that and get it put\nin place and I've got that server.\n\n298\n00:14:53.409 --> 00:14:55.750\nThere's the virtual IP\nthat's attached to it.\n\n299\n00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.524\nNow, I'm gonna wait for that to turn\ngreen and then I'll add a second node and\n\n300\n00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.040\nthat's when this cluster\nbecomes really useful.\n\n301\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.200\nThen I'll have two nodes and the traffic\nis gonna get balanced across them evenly,\n\n302\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.750\n50% to 1, 50% to the other.\n\n303\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:14.350\nIf I bring in a third node, now it's\ngonna do 33% on each 1 of them and\n\n304\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.511\ndistribute across them evenly.\n\n305\n00:15:16.511 --> 00:15:20.190\nNow, what if you have one server\nthat's maybe better than the others?\n\n306\n00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.274\nMaybe it's got more memory or so on.\n\n307\n00:15:22.274 --> 00:15:25.590\nYou can actually go in and\ntweak the balancing on these.\n\n308\n00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.671\nSo when you take a look at them,\nyou've got your host priority and\n\n309\n00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:29.688\nother information.\n\n310\n00:15:29.688 --> 00:15:34.416\nIf we start to edit some of these nodes,\nyou can start to specify that priority\n\n311\n00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:37.909\nvalue to manipulate which one\nis gonna get more traffic or\n\n312\n00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:43.630\nless traffic, so that's definitely\nsomething we can do as the system runs.\n\n313\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.261\nI just got my little green square on\nmy nodes, so I'm gonna come in here and\n\n314\n00:15:47.261 --> 00:15:48.328\nadd in another host.\n\n315\n00:15:48.328 --> 00:15:54.041\nI'm just going to right-click on the\ncluster and choose Add Host To Cluster and\n\n316\n00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:58.227\nI'm gonna put in lab-exchserve02,\nmy other server.\n\n317\n00:15:58.227 --> 00:16:00.996\nSo, it's gonna connect up to it and\nfind its IP address.\n\n318\n00:16:00.996 --> 00:16:04.430\nThere it is, it's 192.168.0.12.\n\n319\n00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.670\nNow its gonna connect up and most of\nthe settings that I had to provide for\n\n320\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.950\nthe other server,\nI don't have to provide here.\n\n321\n00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.590\nBecause it's just gonna learn\nthem from the existing config.\n\n322\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.391\nSo it's just showing me my IP.\n\n323\n00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.840\nI can set a priority, and\nthen I can set its status.\n\n324\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.049\nBut when I move forward,\nsee how it didn't ask me for a virtual IP?\n\n325\n00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:23.208\nIt already knows the virtual IP.\n\n326\n00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:27.180\nAnd it already knows the ports to forward\nbecause that was what was on other one, so\n\n327\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.110\nit's already got that information.\n\n328\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.720\nBut I could come in and edit these,\nand kinda tweak some things.\n\n329\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.600\nNotice down here I've got that\nhandling priority I could change\n\n330\n00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.380\nif we wanted to manipulate these values.\n\n331\n00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.860\nBut otherwise right now,\nit's doing an equal load.\n\n332\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.549\nIt's that load that lets me\ninfluence how much traffic it gets.\n\n333\n00:16:42.549 --> 00:16:45.882\nIf I edit that and I go down here\nto this load and uncheck it.\n\n334\n00:16:45.882 --> 00:16:48.000\nSee how it's 50% right now?\n\n335\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.750\nMaybe I only want this server to get\n30% and the other server gets 70%.\n\n336\n00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.870\nSo I can manipulate that and\n\n337\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.950\nthat's what's gonna change\nthe distribution across these servers.\n\n338\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:01.005\nI'm gonna leave mine equal, though,\ncuz my servers are actually identical, so\n\n339\n00:17:01.005 --> 00:17:02.966\nI don't really care which one we go to.\n\n340\n00:17:02.966 --> 00:17:07.186\nNow if the network load balancing feature\nwas not installed on the other server,\n\n341\n00:17:07.186 --> 00:17:10.535\nit's gonna reach out and install it,\nand then once it's done,\n\n342\n00:17:10.535 --> 00:17:12.650\nit'll bring it into the cluster.\n\n343\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.270\nBut in my case it is already installed,\nso it's just gonna reach out and\n\n344\n00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.130\nit says Pending, it's getting it\nconfigured on the other side, and\n\n345\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.020\nit's gonna put it in place.\n\n346\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.520\nSo that's reaching out and it's doing it.\n\n347\n00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.730\nWhile we're waiting on that,\nI need to create a DNS entry for\n\n348\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.450\nthis new fake server.\n\n349\n00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:33.591\nSo I'm gonna jump over to my domain\ncontroller where I'm running DNS.\n\n350\n00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:39.030\nAnd I'm just gonna jump into my DNS screen\nhere, and I'll browse into my domain.\n\n351\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.210\nAnd in my DNS records here,\nI'll see LAB-EXCHSERV01, LAB-EXCHSERV02,\n\n352\n00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.090\nthat's how people are connecting\nto them directly.\n\n353\n00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:49.070\nI'm gonna create a new A record in here,\nand\n\n354\n00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:54.960\nremember I called my cluster LAB-EXCHSERV\nand I just didn't put a number on it.\n\n355\n00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.070\nThat was gonna be that virtual node.\n\n356\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:02.756\nAnd I'll put in the IP address\nof that node, 192.168.0.222.\n\n357\n00:18:02.756 --> 00:18:06.921\nSo I'm just gonna punch that in,\nI can create a reverse record for\n\n358\n00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:10.060\nit if I want to, and\nwe'll get that put in place.\n\n359\n00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.140\nSo now I've got this server\nthat's not a real server.\n\n360\n00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.203\nIf somebody browses to\nlab-exchserv.lab.itpro.tv,\n\n361\n00:18:17.203 --> 00:18:20.707\nthey'll resolve 192.168.0.222.\n\n362\n00:18:20.707 --> 00:18:24.330\nWhen they go to that IP,\nthey hit the load balance cluster.\n\n363\n00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.008\nThey hit one of the nodes on that cluster.\n\n364\n00:18:27.008 --> 00:18:31.791\nAnd then that node evaluates where traffic\nis laid across the other nodes and\n\n365\n00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:34.860\nsends us to usually the least busy node.\n\n366\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.285\nAnd we get nice load balancing\nacross our hardware.\n\n367\n00:18:37.285 --> 00:18:42.160\nSo it's pretty cool that we could just\nstart adding more Client Access servers\n\n368\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.360\nand our end users still\ngo to the same address.\n\n369\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.545\nSo if we notice our Client Access servers\nare getting too busy, we just add another\n\n370\n00:18:47.545 --> 00:18:50.780\none and we add another one and add another\none and add more as you need them.\n\n371\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.590\nAnd now your clients are taken care of.\n\n372\n00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.830\nOr if you need to take one out for\nmaintenance, you can shut one down and\n\n373\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.900\nthe clients will just get\nsent to other servers.\n\n374\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.960\nAnd now you can do your Windows updates or\n\n375\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.965\nwhatever it is you're doing on that\nsystem and bring it back online.\n\n376\n00:19:03.965 --> 00:19:06.905\nSo it's all hidden to the users\nbecause they connect to\n\n377\n00:19:06.905 --> 00:19:08.685\nthis virtual server right here.\n\n378\n00:19:09.995 --> 00:19:13.645\nAll right,\nlet's take a look at our status, oh, wait,\n\n379\n00:19:13.645 --> 00:19:15.045\nthis one's still sitting here.\n\n380\n00:19:15.045 --> 00:19:16.727\nLet's take a look at our status here.\n\n381\n00:19:16.727 --> 00:19:19.912\nI can see that LAB-EXCHSERV02\nis now in the cluster, and\n\n382\n00:19:19.912 --> 00:19:22.582\nif I look at their status,\nthe status is Converged.\n\n383\n00:19:22.582 --> 00:19:24.224\nConverged is what you wanna see.\n\n384\n00:19:24.224 --> 00:19:28.312\nThat means the cluster nodes\nare all talking to each other,\n\n385\n00:19:28.312 --> 00:19:31.822\nthey've got the same configuration and\nthey're all happy.\n\n386\n00:19:31.822 --> 00:19:36.510\nAnd since their load is set to 50-50,\nhalf the traffic's getting sent to one and\n\n387\n00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.010\nhalf the traffic's getting\nsent to the other.\n\n388\n00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.380\nLet's see if this is working.\n\n389\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.540\nI'm gonna go to a client,\nlet's see, here's my client.\n\n390\n00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.990\nAnd let me just close these\nInternet Explorer windows.\n\n391\n00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.790\nI wanna start from scratch.\n\n392\n00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.660\nI'm gonna fire up an Internet Explorer\nwindow, and I'm gonna browse\n\n393\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:20:00.630\nto https://lab-exchserv.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n394\n00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:05.063\nI'm browsing to that virtual\nname that I just defined in DNS,\n\n395\n00:20:05.063 --> 00:20:09.258\nthat's gonna resolve to 192.168.0.222.\n\n396\n00:20:09.258 --> 00:20:12.282\nAnd I'm gonna hit the network\nload balancer, and\n\n397\n00:20:12.282 --> 00:20:16.700\nthe load balancer is gonna direct me\nto one of the nodes on the back-end.\n\n398\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.132\nAnd actually, I forgot something,\nthat's not gonna work.\n\n399\n00:20:20.132 --> 00:20:22.132\nWhoops, let me try that again.\n\n400\n00:20:22.132 --> 00:20:28.639\nAll right, so\nif I browse to https://lab.exchserv,\n\n401\n00:20:28.639 --> 00:20:31.174\nI need to add in /owa.\n\n402\n00:20:31.174 --> 00:20:32.690\nThere's actually nothing\non that parent page.\n\n403\n00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.330\nI need to get into Outlook web app.\n\n404\n00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.127\nSo it's gonna reach into that cluster and\n\n405\n00:20:36.127 --> 00:20:38.870\nit's gonna get directed\nto one of the nodes.\n\n406\n00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.500\nSo that takes care of the servers.\n\n407\n00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.550\nLet's jump over to a client and\nsee if this works.\n\n408\n00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.080\nSo I'm gonna jump over to a machine and\nremember,\n\n409\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.820\nwe created a virtual server,\na fake server.\n\n410\n00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:52.505\nI should be able to fire open a command\nprompt and do something crazy like ping\n\n411\n00:20:52.505 --> 00:20:57.890\n192.168.0.222, that's that virtual IP,\nand I'm getting ping responses.\n\n412\n00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:02.870\nThere's no actual server at 222, it's the\nload balancing cluster that I'm hitting.\n\n413\n00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.310\nAnd so if I fire up a web browser and\n\n414\n00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.330\nI point to that cluster,\nI'll get load balanced.\n\n415\n00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.339\nIf I go to https://lab.exchserv,\n\n416\n00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:19.633\nthat's that load balance cluster\nwe just made, and I'll go to /owa.\n\n417\n00:21:19.633 --> 00:21:21.520\nWell, I'm getting a certificate warning.\n\n418\n00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.170\nNow why am I getting\na certificate warning?\n\n419\n00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.870\nWell, each server had\na self-signed certificate.\n\n420\n00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.440\nSo LAB-EXCHSERV01, LAB-EXCHSERV02,\nthey had self-signed certificates.\n\n421\n00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.110\nNow I'm accessing it with a different\ndomain name and it doesn't match.\n\n422\n00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:40.100\nSo I'll need to generate an SSL\ncertificate that matches LAB-EXCHSERV and\n\n423\n00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.460\nattach that to all of my Client Access\nservers that are in this load balancing\n\n424\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.230\ncluster so the certificate matches.\n\n425\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.380\nBut aside from that,\nI am actually in here.\n\n426\n00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.420\nAnd if I go and try and\nlog in, I can get in there.\n\n427\n00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.430\nNow looking at this, do I know if I'm\nconnected to Exchange Server 1 or\n\n428\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.850\nExchange Server 2?\n\n429\n00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:57.540\nI don't.\n\n430\n00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.020\nThe end user doesn't know whether\nthey're on one or the other.\n\n431\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:00.960\nIt's seamless to them.\n\n432\n00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.870\nThey just see this general server\nname that's part of the cluster\n\n433\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:06.320\nthat we defined.\n\n434\n00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.200\nBut if I go and take a look at\nthe certificate attached to this thing,\n\n435\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.740\nI can find out who it is.\n\n436\n00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.240\nI'm attached to server number 2.\n\n437\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.850\nI connected to a generic name but I ended\nup on server number 2 because that's where\n\n438\n00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.370\nthe load balancing cluster\nfelt I should have ended up.\n\n439\n00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.400\nSo half the traffic being\nsent to one server,\n\n440\n00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.370\nhalf the traffic being sent to the other.\n\n441\n00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.320\nNow the really cool stuff here\nis that if we see our servers\n\n442\n00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.400\nstart to get really busy,\nwe can start to add more servers in.\n\n443\n00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.850\nAnd they don't have to be identical.\n\n444\n00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.610\nI can add in servers with more memory or\nbetter processors, or\n\n445\n00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.745\nthey can be weaker memory and\njust add a bunch more of them.\n\n446\n00:22:35.745 --> 00:22:38.590\nWhatever it is that I need,\nI can add them in there.\n\n447\n00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.420\nAnd if I need to do maintenance\nI can take a server out.\n\n448\n00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.290\nNow it probably won't be on the Exchange\nexam but I do want to show you guys how to\n\n449\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.510\ntake a server out for maintenance and\ncreate the least impact.\n\n450\n00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:51.352\nBecause when a user's logged in on one\nserver and they get moved to another node,\n\n451\n00:22:51.352 --> 00:22:55.460\nit resets their session and they have to\nlogin again, and that annoys the users.\n\n452\n00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.770\nSo we want to try and\nkeep that to a minimum if we can.\n\n453\n00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.230\nYou don't want people\nconstantly relogging in.\n\n454\n00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.880\nSo in network load balancing,\nwe have a feature called drain stop.\n\n455\n00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.470\nWhat drain stop does is it says,\ntake a server and\n\n456\n00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.440\ndon't send any more connections to it,\nbut let\n\n457\n00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:15.230\nthe existing connections continue to work\nuntil those users log out on their own.\n\n458\n00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.840\nAnd that way, over a period of\ntime the users trickle out, and\n\n459\n00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.810\nnow the server becomes available.\n\n460\n00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:21.540\nSo let me show you how that works.\n\n461\n00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.350\nSo let's say that I need to do some\nmaintenance on node number two.\n\n462\n00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.130\nRight, this LAB-EXCHSERV02.\n\n463\n00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.540\nI want to take it out and\ndo some Windows updates.\n\n464\n00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:34.200\nSo I can right-click on that, and\nI can go to Control Host > Drainstop.\n\n465\n00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.290\nI could just choose Stop and that would\ntake it out of commission right now.\n\n466\n00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:42.010\nBut if I choose Drainstop, it's gonna say,\ndon't send any new people to that server\n\n467\n00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.900\nbut let the existing connections finish.\n\n468\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:50.160\nSo if I've got a session open, like this\nOWA session here, it'll let me finish.\n\n469\n00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.490\nAnd then when I'm done, I sign out,\n\n470\n00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:57.740\nmy session's over, we kinda close,\nand then that's the end of it.\n\n471\n00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.698\nWell, back here, it's watching that,\nand when the last session is done,\n\n472\n00:24:02.698 --> 00:24:04.952\nthen this server will go offline.\n\n473\n00:24:04.952 --> 00:24:07.091\nAnd when it's offline,\nthen I can go and do maintenance.\n\n474\n00:24:07.091 --> 00:24:09.151\nNow that might take 5 minutes,\nit might take 20 minutes.\n\n475\n00:24:09.151 --> 00:24:11.611\nI think 20 minutes is the default.\n\n476\n00:24:11.611 --> 00:24:16.971\nThere is a setting that defines\nthe maximum time it'll wait.\n\n477\n00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:18.508\nLet's see if I can remember\nwhere that setting is,\n\n478\n00:24:18.508 --> 00:24:20.650\nit's been a long time since\nI've messed with that one.\n\n479\n00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.620\nBut somewhere is a limit on how long it\nwill wait, I want to say it's 20 minutes\n\n480\n00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.470\nand after 20 minutes if there's still\nsomebody in there it just kicks them out.\n\n481\n00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:32.100\nBut for me, I'm logged out,\nif I go and create a new sessions, so\n\n482\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:38.840\nif I fire up a web browser and, and\ntry and browse back to that system, right.\n\n483\n00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.990\nI'm gonna go and\nget connected in, here we go, and\n\n484\n00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.920\nnow if I look at the certificate on this\none I can see I'm connected to Serve 01,\n\n485\n00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.180\nsee how it just flipped\nme over to the other one.\n\n486\n00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:53.300\nAnybody new is gonna get connected to\nServe 01, Serve 02 empties out, and\n\n487\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.450\nwhen it's actually empty, this will\nchange to let me know the node is down.\n\n488\n00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.010\nRight now It says that it's converging,\n\n489\n00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.910\nit's still kind of going\nthrough that process.\n\n490\n00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.850\nSometimes this screen doesn't refresh very\nwell, so I'm just going to right-click and\n\n491\n00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.830\nrefresh, and it's probably down already.\n\n492\n00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.210\nAnd yep there it is, yep.\n\n493\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.620\nI can see that it's stopped,\n\n494\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.090\nI'm now free to do whatever\nmaintenance on that system I need.\n\n495\n00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.600\nI can reboot it, do updates, whatever.\n\n496\n00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.375\nAnd when I'm done I just\nbring it back into the pool.\n\n497\n00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:20.250\nYou can right-click on it,\ngo to control host and go to Start, and\n\n498\n00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.630\nthat's gonna bring it back into the pool,\nand be ready for action, right.\n\n499\n00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.610\nSo, really neat that we get that\nfunctionality, this works for\n\n500\n00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.250\nall the client access server functions.\n\n501\n00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:35.010\nOWA, Outlook Anywhere, POP3,\nIMAP 4, it works great for\n\n502\n00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:40.030\nall those, you can get it set up It does\nnot work for mailbox databases, all right?\n\n503\n00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.710\nYou cannot load balance user\nacross mailbox databases.\n\n504\n00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:48.300\nTheir mailbox exists actively on\none server and one server only.\n\n505\n00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.250\nEven if you have database\navailability groups and\n\n506\n00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:54.330\nthe email is stored in more than one\nplace, there's only one active copy, and\n\n507\n00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.940\nthat's what users need to connect to.\n\n508\n00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.272\nSo don't do NLB on a mailbox\ndatabase server, or if you do,\n\n509\n00:25:59.272 --> 00:26:00.820\ncuz technically I'm doing here.\n\n510\n00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:05.440\nIf you do, don't try and balance the ports\nthat it uses for the mailbox database,\n\n511\n00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.680\nright, that are RPC and MapE ports,\ndon't try and load balance those.\n\n512\n00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:14.590\nBe really specific and only load balance\nthe client access ports like I did here,\n\n513\n00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.040\nso that's how we kind\nof keep that in line.\n\n514\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.530\nBut using Windows Load Balancing Service\nit's not very hard,\n\n515\n00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:23.360\nit's pretty easy to get set up, it's\na part of Windows Server Standard Edition,\n\n516\n00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.010\nyou don't have to pay extra for it,\nyou don't need clustered hardware.\n\n517\n00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.910\nIt's a quick and\neasy way to get load balancing in place,\n\n518\n00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.730\nto get redundancy in place,\nand to get seamless,\n\n519\n00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:36.490\ninvisible maintenance in place, to keep\nthe servers up and keep your users happy.\n\n520\n00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.570\nSo it's a really great system, and\nit's all built right in there.\n\n521\n00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:44.050\nAll right, so in this episode we got\na chance to see the Windows load balancing\n\n522\n00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.820\nsystem and how we can use that to\ncreate redundant client access servers.\n\n523\n00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.350\nReal important to keep the visibility\nof our network up and healthy.\n\n524\n00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.160\nPretty easy to implement,\n\n525\n00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.980\ndefinitely something you'll want to\nuse out there in the production world.\n\n526\n00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.481\nAll right, well, I hope you guys enjoyed\nthe episode, signing off for ITProTV,\n\n527\n00:26:58.481 --> 00:27:00.432\nI'm Don Pezet, and I'll see you next time.\n\n528\n00:27:00.432 --> 00:27:05.810\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:15.641\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:19.850\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Exchange 2013.\n\n5\n00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.090\nIn this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at Send and Receive Connectors.\n\n6\n00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.470\nAnd if you haven't heard of these guys,\nthey're kind of important.\n\n7\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.590\nAny email coming in or out of your\norganization passes through a Send or\n\n8\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.060\na Receive Connector.\n\n9\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.840\nIt sends for the outgoing,\nreceives are for the incoming.\n\n10\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.090\nAnd they dictate whether or not that\nemail is even allowed to pass through.\n\n11\n00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.890\nAnd if you've set up a brand\nnew install of Exchange 2013,\n\n12\n00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.730\nyou might have noticed a little problem.\n\n13\n00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.790\nThat your unable to send to the internet.\n\n14\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.280\nAnd that's because the default\nconfiguration of Center Receive\n\n15\n00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.140\nConnectors, isn't configured\nproperly right out to the internet.\n\n16\n00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.750\nSo it gives you a little bit of a problem.\n\n17\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.760\nWe got to make sure we go in and\nwe tweak these.\n\n18\n00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.070\nAll right, now, you might ask yourself,\n\n19\n00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.330\nwhy doesn't Microsoft configure this stuff\nfor me, so it works right out of the box?\n\n20\n00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.930\nThe answer is, there's a lot of\nroom to make mistakes here, and\n\n21\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.040\nif you make a mistake your server can\npotentially be open to relay spam.\n\n22\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.330\nSo Microsoft says, we're going\nto set it up for internal email.\n\n23\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.600\nAnd if you want external, if you want\nemail to the Internet, you can set it up\n\n24\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.340\nyourself and make sure that it is set up\nproperly so you're not relaying spam.\n\n25\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.320\nWe definitely don't wanna get on one of\nthose email blacklists that's out there,\n\n26\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.900\nthen you gotta go through\nthe headache of getting delisted and\n\n27\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.100\nit's just a nightmare.\n\n28\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.430\nFortunately, it's not that hard to set up,\nwe just need to know to do it.\n\n29\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.000\nAll right.\n\n30\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.560\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n31\n00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.900\nFirst off, we need to kind of\nunderstand where these send and\n\n32\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.570\nreceive connectors come in, and\nit all has to do with mail flow.\n\n33\n00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.880\nIn some of the other episodes,\nwe've talked about mail flow,\n\n34\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.630\nwhich is talking really about how that\nemail moves from server to server through\n\n35\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.900\nyour organization.\n\n36\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.882\nAnd inside of mail flow,\nyou'll see things like accepted domains.\n\n37\n00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:54.980\nThese are domains that we're\nallowed to receive email for, but\n\n38\n00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.380\nas far as sending, we can send as anybody.\n\n39\n00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.630\nBut you'll see right here, you've got your\nreceive and your send connectors where\n\n40\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.050\nwe can define how that email,\nwhat are the entry points for the email,\n\n41\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.590\nwhat are the exits point for the email,\nand how we want that to flow.\n\n42\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.400\nNow, before we do that, I wanna show\nyou guys something real quick about my\n\n43\n00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.350\ntopology, and\nthen we'll look at the default settings.\n\n44\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.280\nSo, I'm gonna jump all the way down here\nto servers and pull up my list of servers.\n\n45\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.270\nIn my exchange topology,\nI have three exchange servers.\n\n46\n00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.250\nI have Lab Exchanger Server 1,\nit's just a mailbox server.\n\n47\n00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.260\nNumber two is a client access server,\nnumber three is a mailbox and\n\n48\n00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.580\na client access server.\n\n49\n00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.800\nAnd the reason I did this is I wanna\nshow you guys the different connectors\n\n50\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.890\nthat are set up by default for each one.\n\n51\n00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.840\nI have not modified my\nconnectors one single bit, so\n\n52\n00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.770\nthese are the default ones that we've got.\n\n53\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.540\nIt'll have some created for\neach of these, all right.\n\n54\n00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.910\nNow, when we go and start to define\nthese settings, what you'll notice\n\n55\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.510\nis that each server maintains its\nown receive connectors, right?\n\n56\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.590\nThe receive connectors for incoming email,\nthat's dictated on each individual server.\n\n57\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.160\nBut the send connectors for\ngoing out to the internet,\n\n58\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.920\nthose are actually shared, so\nit's a little bit of a different behavior\n\n59\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.430\nbetween the different connector types and\nwe'll see that in the configuration.\n\n60\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.710\nAlright, now when I jump back to mail flow\nand I go up here to my receive connectors\n\n61\n00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.670\nremember how I said receive connectors are\nmanaged per server So the first thing I\n\n62\n00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.230\nsee is this drop-down box, where I\ncan pick what server I'm looking at.\n\n63\n00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.880\nIf I jump over to send connectors, see how\nI don't have that server drop-down box?\n\n64\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.640\nAnd that's because these are shared\nacross all the servers, right, so\n\n65\n00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.810\nthat's a little bit different.\n\n66\n00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.820\nAnd also notice I don't have any.\n\n67\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.480\nThere's no send connectors.\n\n68\n00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.380\nWhy not?\n\n69\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.260\nWell, that means I can't send email.\n\n70\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.040\nIt doesn't mean you can't send any email.\n\n71\n00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.880\nYou can send internal email.\n\n72\n00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.220\nInternal email is any email destined for\none of these accepted domains.\n\n73\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.310\nSo I have lab.itpro.tv and itprotv.net.\n\n74\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.770\nIf I send an email to either of those\ndomains, I handle it internally,\n\n75\n00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:49.910\nthat works fine.\n\n76\n00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.340\nI've got internal email.\n\n77\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.500\nBut if I try and email somebody on\nthe Internet, it's gonna bounce.\n\n78\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.040\nIt's gonna fail.\n\n79\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.670\nIt's not gonna be able to\nget out to the Internet.\n\n80\n00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.150\nI can receive email from the Internet, but\n\n81\n00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.980\nI can't send to it myself,\nbecause I have no Send connectors.\n\n82\n00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.240\nSo that's absolutely something we're gonna\nhave to correct if we want our system\n\n83\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.930\nto function properly.\n\n84\n00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.430\nNow, on the Receive side,\n\n85\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.260\nMicrosoft has already set up\nsome received connectors for me.\n\n86\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.660\nAnd the connectors they set up vary based\non what type of server it is, right.\n\n87\n00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.620\nRemember when you install Exchange,\nyou pick from some server roles.\n\n88\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.080\nYou pick whether you want it\nto be a Mailbox server or\n\n89\n00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.510\nwhether it's a Client Access server.\n\n90\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.970\nAnd those servers have some\nother functions they perform.\n\n91\n00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.920\nFor example there's\nthe Front End Transport service.\n\n92\n00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.790\nAnd the hub transport service, and\nthen the mailbox transport service.\n\n93\n00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.080\nThose three are what used to be\ncalled the Hub Transport Server.\n\n94\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.820\nMicrosoft broke those up\ninto three services, and\n\n95\n00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.760\nspread them across our\nservers in different ways.\n\n96\n00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.350\nAnd that changes these receive connectors.\n\n97\n00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.370\nAll right?\n\n98\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.230\nIf you're a mailbox server.\n\n99\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.460\nA mailbox server's gonna run\nthe hub transport service and\n\n100\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.190\nthe mailbox transport service.\n\n101\n00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.610\nIt's the one that's responsible for\napplying our transport rules and\n\n102\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.520\nputting email in the mailboxes.\n\n103\n00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.660\nThis is what's actually gonna to\nbe putting email in the mailbox.\n\n104\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.950\nThat's kind of important.\n\n105\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.160\nAnd so when I pick a server that's\na mailbox server like my server number one\n\n106\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.530\nor my server number three,\nthey're both mailbox servers.\n\n107\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.460\nThey're gonna have two received\nconnectors by default.\n\n108\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.100\nAnd if you look at them,\none is a Client Proxy, and\n\n109\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.560\none is just called default, all right.\n\n110\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.000\nThe default is the most common one.\n\n111\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.320\nIf I edit the default and\ntake a look at it, what we'll see in here\n\n112\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.040\nis that it's basically a receive\nconnector, it's set up to receive email,\n\n113\n00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.440\nit has a limit on it holding\nemails to below 35 megabytes.\n\n114\n00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.290\nSo if I get an email that's bigger than 35\nmegabytes, I reject it, email's too big.\n\n115\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.030\nYou might want to make that bigger for\nyour environment or\n\n116\n00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.500\nsmaller for your environment, right?\n\n117\n00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.400\nI hate email attachments.\n\n118\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.810\nSo you might wanna make it smaller.\n\n119\n00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.100\nThough we can define right here\nthat it's allowed to receive email.\n\n120\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.140\nAnd under security, we say who\nare allowed to receive email from.\n\n121\n00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.270\nAnd if you look at who\nyou're receiving it from,\n\n122\n00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.430\nyou're receiving only\nencrypted connections.\n\n123\n00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.790\nIf I look at this list, right?\n\n124\n00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.780\nTLS, basic authentication users using TLS\nand Exchange Server Authentication, right?\n\n125\n00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.040\nSo it's only authenticated users.\n\n126\n00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.320\nAnd then down here it's limited to\nExchange servers, Legacy Exchange servers,\n\n127\n00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.200\nthose would be like Exchange 2000 and\nearlier, and Exchange users.\n\n128\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.580\nSee how Anonymous users are not checked.\n\n129\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.950\nIf I receive an email from the internet,\nare they gonna authenticate against me?\n\n130\n00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.330\nNot normally, right?\n\n131\n00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.030\nSo, a mailbox server will not\naccept unauthenticated connections.\n\n132\n00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.890\nIt's protected,\nyou can't send an email to it.\n\n133\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.260\nAnd that's because your not suppose to.\n\n134\n00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.150\nIncoming email from the internet is\nsuppose to go to a client access server,\n\n135\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.500\nnot a mailbox server.\n\n136\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.330\nAnd that's why that\npermission is not enabled.\n\n137\n00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.520\nAnd then if I go down to Scoping,\nI'll see it's tied to\n\n138\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.320\nall the email addresses on this server and\nit's tied to Port 25.\n\n139\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.760\nThat's the SMTP port, right?\n\n140\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.260\nSMTP is not encrypted by default, but\n\n141\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.370\nunder security,\nI'm requiring authentication and\n\n142\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.480\nencryption, so it'll have to be encrypted\nSMTP to connect to the mailbox.\n\n143\n00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.560\nInternet users are not gonna\nbe able to connect to that.\n\n144\n00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.820\nThis is suitable only for\ninternal connections, right?\n\n145\n00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.350\nSo the take-away from this screen is that\nany mailbox server will have secure,\n\n146\n00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.000\nencrypted receive connectors, so\nonly internal servers can talk to it.\n\n147\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.500\nInternet email can not\ngo to a mailbox server.\n\n148\n00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.260\nNow that's one of the connectors,\nthe one on port 25,\n\n149\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.620\nthere's this other one client proxy.\n\n150\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.770\nWhat's that all about?\n\n151\n00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.900\nWell, if I take a look at the client proxy\nit's actually going to be set up the same\n\n152\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.970\nas the other one.\n\n153\n00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.390\nThe big difference is the scoping.\n\n154\n00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.920\nWhen we look at the scoping\nit's tied to port 465.\n\n155\n00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.250\nAnd when we go under security, notice how\nLegacy Exchange Server is turned off.\n\n156\n00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.520\nAnd it's got Exchange servers and\nExchange users.\n\n157\n00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.140\nThis is the connector that Outlook uses.\n\n158\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.250\nIf you're running Microsoft Outlook,\nit's gonna try and\n\n159\n00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.450\nconnect your exchange servers on\nTCP465 and establish a session there.\n\n160\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.420\nSo, this is a connection proxy for\n\n161\n00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.840\nOutlook to be able to connect to\nthe mailbox server, all right.\n\n162\n00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.337\nIf you're not using Outlook,\nthen you're not using this connector.\n\n163\n00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:54.147\nThe server's will use it io talk\nto each other, but otherwise,\n\n164\n00:07:54.147 --> 00:07:55.823\nit won't get used for anything else.\n\n165\n00:07:55.823 --> 00:07:59.414\nSo, that's what this one is for,\nthe client proxy is really for Outlook,\n\n166\n00:07:59.414 --> 00:07:59.994\nall right.\n\n167\n00:07:59.994 --> 00:08:02.385\nSo looking at this configuration here for\n\n168\n00:08:02.385 --> 00:08:06.140\na mailbox server it's just\ninternal connections.\n\n169\n00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.188\nIf I switch to a client access server\nthat's where things get different.\n\n170\n00:08:10.188 --> 00:08:14.375\nIt has a a client front end,\n\n171\n00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:17.325\na default front end, and\nan outbound proxy front end.\n\n172\n00:08:17.325 --> 00:08:19.915\nNow it's got three different connectors.\n\n173\n00:08:19.915 --> 00:08:23.865\nAnd the reason here is that it's\nallowing clients to connect, right?\n\n174\n00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:27.905\nPeople that are running Outlook or\nother third party email clients,\n\n175\n00:08:27.905 --> 00:08:29.700\npeople that are using SMTP but\n\n176\n00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.170\nit's also allowing unauthenticated\ninternet connections to come in.\n\n177\n00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.180\nCuz if we wanna receive email from the\ninternet, it has to be unauthenticated.\n\n178\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.220\nPeople won't have a user\nend password on our system.\n\n179\n00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.620\nThey need to be able to connect and\ndeposit email.\n\n180\n00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.970\nNow that doesn't mean we want people to\njust be able to send whatever the heck\n\n181\n00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:44.540\nthey want, right?\n\n182\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.000\nWe wanna limit it just to us.\n\n183\n00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.430\nAnd so, by default, we will only\nreceive email from accepted domains.\n\n184\n00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.830\nIf it's email that's going to somebody\nat itprotv.net or email going to\n\n185\n00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.340\nsomebody at lab.itpro.tv, I'll allow\nit to come in my receive connector.\n\n186\n00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.250\nBut if it's destined for\n\n187\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:06.190\nsomebody at gmail.com or at microsoft.com,\nthat's not mine, I'm gonna throw it away.\n\n188\n00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.060\nThat would be a relay.\n\n189\n00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.930\nI don't want a relay by default.\n\n190\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.220\nAnd so that's how these\nconnectors are configured.\n\n191\n00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.680\nIf I go to my receive connectors and\nI look at this default.\n\n192\n00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.505\nI'm gonna edit the default front end one.\n\n193\n00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:18.540\nAnd when you look at it, it's set up here.\n\n194\n00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.790\nIt's got that maximum mail size set.\n\n195\n00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.200\nUnder security,\nI've got security is available but\n\n196\n00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.930\nI also have anonymous enabled.\n\n197\n00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.670\nRight?\n\n198\n00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.130\nAnybody can connect to this\nwithout authenticating.\n\n199\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.550\nThey can just connect and\nstart sending email.\n\n200\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.270\nAll right, now under scoping,\nI can see that this is tied to port 25, so\n\n201\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.560\nthese are my SMTP connections,\nwhat we receive email from.\n\n202\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.720\nAnd it's not requiring authentication.\n\n203\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.060\nThat sounds risky.\n\n204\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.590\nBut it's limited to the accepted domain,\nso\n\n205\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.450\nthat's what stops this\nfrom being a true relay.\n\n206\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.080\nAll right?\n\n207\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.060\nSo we've got this one set up, and that's\nwhat's allowing internet email to come in.\n\n208\n00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.200\nSo If I want internet email to come\ndirectly into my mail organization,\n\n209\n00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.580\nI can go and change the MX records in\nDNS to point right to this server,\n\n210\n00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.980\nand internet email will\nnow flow to this server,\n\n211\n00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.240\nit'll receive it on this default connector\nand, as long as it's destined for\n\n212\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.870\nan accepted domain,\nit'll flow into the mailboxes.\n\n213\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.960\nWill reach out using one\nof the private connectors\n\n214\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.440\nto talk to the mailbox server and get the\nemail deposited in the mailbox, all right.\n\n215\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.490\nNow, what are these other two?\n\n216\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.840\nWell, we've got this client front end here\nand if you take a look at the client front\n\n217\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.660\nend, this is like the client\non the back end, right.\n\n218\n00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.590\nWe'll see similar settings across these,\nwe've got security.\n\n219\n00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.570\nAnonymous is disabled and\nit's set up for exchange users, right?\n\n220\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.520\nAnd if I look at the scoping,\nthis one is tied to port 587.\n\n221\n00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.960\nThis is an encrypted SMTP connection,\nright.\n\n222\n00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:45.760\nSecure SMTP uses 587 so Outlook can\nuse this or POP 3 and IMAP 4 users.\n\n223\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.290\nThey have to specify\nan SMTP server to send.\n\n224\n00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.120\nNow on this one,\nwe require authentication,\n\n225\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.900\nbecause when they authenticate,\n\n226\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.460\nthey might be sending email to somebody at\ngmail.com or somebody at microsoft.com.\n\n227\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.020\nAnd we want a relay for\nauthenticated users.\n\n228\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.870\nSo this connector is different\nfrom the default one,\n\n229\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.840\nin that we allow relays here on this one,\nright?\n\n230\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.640\nNow that's like a check\nmark we can turn on.\n\n231\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.780\nYou can go into PowerShell and manipulate\nit, but right from here the default,\n\n232\n00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.060\nthe way that it is setup,\nis that this one will allow that relay.\n\n233\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.056\nAnd then lastly we have\nthis outbound proxy, and\n\n234\n00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:22.040\nthe outbound proxy that's what we're using\nwhen we connect back to other servers.\n\n235\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.380\nSo if I look at my settings,\nsee how it's limited to Exchange servers?\n\n236\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.770\nAnd if I go down to\nthe scoping it's on port 717.\n\n237\n00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.700\nThat's not a standard email\nport that we're used to seeing.\n\n238\n00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.220\nIt's one that Exchange servers\nare using to be able to communicate\n\n239\n00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.300\nbetween each other.\n\n240\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.630\nAnd we'll see that if you setup like\nan edge transport server it can be used to\n\n241\n00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.555\ntalk to that too although\nit doesn't have to be.\n\n242\n00:11:41.555 --> 00:11:45.070\nAlright, so those are some of the\nconnectors that are defined by default.\n\n243\n00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.600\nWe might choose to define some\ncustom connectors if we want, right?\n\n244\n00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.230\nIf we have special needs that\ngo beyond what the defaults are,\n\n245\n00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.420\nwe can create our own connectors, or\nwe can even modify these if we want to.\n\n246\n00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.270\nAlright, I want to show you one more\nexample before I start modifying this\n\n247\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.230\nstuff, though.\n\n248\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.180\nWhat if you're a mailbox server and\na client access server?\n\n249\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.340\nSo, lab, my server number three here\nis both mailbox and client accss.\n\n250\n00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.080\nWhen we look at that, see how it ends\nup with five different connectors?\n\n251\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:16.310\nIt's a mixture and if I sort by role,\nI can see these three are my front end.\n\n252\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.070\nThose are the ones that I'm getting\nfrom the client access role.\n\n253\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.490\nAnd these bottom two are hub transport.\n\n254\n00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.290\nThose are the ones I'm getting\nfrom the mailbox role.\n\n255\n00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.320\nSo even though I'm one server, I'm acting\nlike two completely separate servers.\n\n256\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.750\nAnd I'm actually going to be\nrelaying email between myself\n\n257\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.310\nas I move things from the client\naccess role to the mailbox role.\n\n258\n00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.870\nSo even though you're running both of\nthe same server, it's still technically\n\n259\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.240\ntwo separate entities,\ntwo separate roles running on that server,\n\n260\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.975\nand they've gotta communicate between\neach other, so it will show up like this.\n\n261\n00:12:41.975 --> 00:12:46.320\nAlright now, let's say I've got some\nkind of business partner out there.\n\n262\n00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.050\nSomebody who is gonna be sending email to\nme, and they need to send email to me.\n\n263\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:55.600\nI wanna relay for them, but they can't\nauthenticate, or something of that nature.\n\n264\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.630\nI've got something that\nI need to customize.\n\n265\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.740\nOr you can create custom receive\nconnectors that are tailored to\n\n266\n00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.940\nthat particular partner.\n\n267\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.340\nThere's all sorts of different\nthings we can do there.\n\n268\n00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.380\nSo for example,\nI can jump back to my front end server and\n\n269\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.690\nI can add in a new receive connector and\nwhen I add that\n\n270\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.730\nnew receive connector I can give it a name\nand I can specify what it's intent is for.\n\n271\n00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.410\nIs this a custom one that I\nwant to tailor everything and\n\n272\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.320\nallow an application to relay.\n\n273\n00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.050\nIs this internal use only for receiving\nemail, is it a partner connection,\n\n274\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.450\nI'm receiving trusted connections\nfrom another partner or\n\n275\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.520\nis this some kind of client like\na non Outlook client connecting.\n\n276\n00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.700\nYou can dictate that right here.\n\n277\n00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.750\nAn example of how I might use this\nis let's say that you got a big\n\n278\n00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.970\noffice printer and you want that\nprinter to be able to send email.\n\n279\n00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.460\nYou want it to be able to send email\nto anybody in the world, right?\n\n280\n00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.020\nMaybe it's got one of those\nscan to email functions.\n\n281\n00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.000\nAnd so, I want it to be able to send\nthe email through my mail server.\n\n282\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.620\nBut it can't authenticate it, doesn't\nsupport providing username and password.\n\n283\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.570\nI could create a custom receive\nconnector just for that printer and\n\n284\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.970\nthen open it up to allow it to relay now\nto be able to send through my mail system\n\n285\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.440\nand I won't have to worry about\nthe authentication side, alright?\n\n286\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.930\nSo I'll call this my office printer,\nright, so\n\n287\n00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.790\nthat's the name that\nI'm gonna assign to it.\n\n288\n00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.590\nI'm going to tell her\nthat this one's custom,\n\n289\n00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.350\nright I'm going to allow\nan application to relay.\n\n290\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.340\nAnd then we can specify our bindings.\n\n291\n00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:20.010\nNow the binding is if I have more than one\nnetwork adaptor on my Exchange server,\n\n292\n00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.200\nwhich network adaptor is it listening on,\nand\n\n293\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.290\nthis is important because you only\nhave one port 25 on each IP address,\n\n294\n00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.400\nso if you have more than one IP address,\nyou could split this up.\n\n295\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.210\nThe default is to say all\navailable IP addresses, so\n\n296\n00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.040\nif I have more than one address, all of\nthem are gonna be listening on port 25.\n\n297\n00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.770\nWell, I've already got\na connector listening on port 25.\n\n298\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.880\nSo I'm going to edit this and\nI'm going to change it.\n\n299\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.020\nAnd I can save a specific IP\naddress on my, system IPv4 or IPv6,\n\n300\n00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.370\nor I could say all of them.\n\n301\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.150\nIf I do all of them, I'm going to\nneed to pick a different port number.\n\n302\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.670\nSo I'm going to say, 60,025.\n\n303\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.920\nOn my printer, when I set it up,\nI'm going to point to the server and\n\n304\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.830\ntell it to use port 60025 so\nit will know the port to use to connect.\n\n305\n00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:06.690\nAlright.\n\n306\n00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.780\nSo that's gonna be the scope for\nthis thing and I'll hit next.\n\n307\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.020\nAnd now the remote network.\n\n308\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.110\nI wanna limit this just to that printer.\n\n309\n00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.710\nI don't want anybody to connect\nbecause I'm gonna be turning off\n\n310\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.160\nauthentication, right.\n\n311\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.630\nSo I need them to be able\nto be limited and secure.\n\n312\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:27.200\nAnd so the best way to do that is to kind\nof come in here and edit this IP address.\n\n313\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.980\nI just removed that catch all and\nput in a specific address.\n\n314\n00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:37.350\nSo maybe that printer is 192.168.0.223,\nI'll put in exactly that address.\n\n315\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.750\nAnd you can decide your notation.\n\n316\n00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.270\nSo if you wanna do a whole\nyou subnet you can.\n\n317\n00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.112\nMaybe I won't allow unauthenticated\nemail from my whole internal subnet,\n\n318\n00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:47.993\nanybody on my internal network\ncan send email great, but\n\n319\n00:15:47.993 --> 00:15:51.833\nwe usually don't wanna go that far I'm\ngonna do just this printer right, so\n\n320\n00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:55.281\nI'm adding that one IP specifically,\nso now when I receive email.\n\n321\n00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:59.701\nFrom 192.168.0.223 on port 60025,\n\n322\n00:15:59.701 --> 00:16:04.033\nthis received connector is\nwhat's gonna take effect.\n\n323\n00:16:04.033 --> 00:16:05.137\nAll right?\n\n324\n00:16:05.137 --> 00:16:09.055\nSo I'll finish that up and now I've\ngot the receive connector created.\n\n325\n00:16:09.055 --> 00:16:12.575\nFrom there I can edit it, and\nin its settings I can go in and\n\n326\n00:16:12.575 --> 00:16:16.075\nmanipulate security, and\nI'm gonna set this one to Allow anonymous.\n\n327\n00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:19.255\nI want anonymous connections to be able to\ncome into this one, because the printer,\n\n328\n00:16:19.255 --> 00:16:22.965\nfor whatever reason, doesn't support\nauthentication, so I can customize that.\n\n329\n00:16:22.965 --> 00:16:24.375\nBut I'm not putting myself at risk.\n\n330\n00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:28.001\nNormally I'd cringe at this, like [SOUND],\nI don't want just anybody to be able to\n\n331\n00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:30.962\nconnect, here it's okay because\nI've limited it to that one IP.\n\n332\n00:16:30.962 --> 00:16:33.469\nNow, in theory,\nsomebody could spoof that IP,\n\n333\n00:16:33.469 --> 00:16:36.540\nso this isn't foolproof but\nit is limiting it to internal.\n\n334\n00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.260\nI don't have to worry about\nInternet users connecting to that.\n\n335\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.530\nAnd I can always modify my scoping if I\nwanna change that port number or whatever,\n\n336\n00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.290\nI can come in and change that too.\n\n337\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:48.220\nSo now I've got a custom receive\nconnector just for that office printer so\n\n338\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.170\nthat it can connect.\n\n339\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.320\nIt can be anonymous, and\nit can start to relay email, and\n\n340\n00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.590\nit'll have it right there, right?\n\n341\n00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.080\nSo just remember that receive connectors,\nthis is the way for email to come in\n\n342\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.130\nyour organization, and the default\nconfiguration is probably fine for\n\n343\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.130\nmost people, but there are times\nwhen you might wanna configure that.\n\n344\n00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.010\nYou might wanna modify it.\n\n345\n00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:12.979\nThe one area where we absolutely\nhave to modify are send connectors.\n\n346\n00:17:12.979 --> 00:17:14.454\nThe send connector's the way out.\n\n347\n00:17:14.454 --> 00:17:16.636\nHow do we get out of our organization?\n\n348\n00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:19.330\nAnd when you go out,\nyou use a send connector.\n\n349\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.520\nThe problem is by default,\nwe don't have any.\n\n350\n00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.190\nSo by default you can only send email to\npeople that are in your organization and\n\n351\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.132\nthat's that.\n\n352\n00:17:27.132 --> 00:17:29.410\nIf wanna send people outside\nof our organization,\n\n353\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.110\nwe've gotta create a send connector.\n\n354\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.500\nAnd for most people, we wanna be\nable to send to the Internet, so\n\n355\n00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.070\nthat's usually where we start.\n\n356\n00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:40.090\nWhen you create a send connector, the send\nconnectors are built upon a domain name.\n\n357\n00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:44.590\nSo you say when I'm sending email to\nthis domain, here's how you get there.\n\n358\n00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.629\nSo we may set up an Internet one\nthat's gonna catch all domains.\n\n359\n00:17:48.629 --> 00:17:50.684\nAnd you say all domains by\nusing an asterisk, right?\n\n360\n00:17:50.684 --> 00:17:51.566\nA wild card.\n\n361\n00:17:51.566 --> 00:17:55.073\nSo a wild card sim connector is\nusually the first thing that we make.\n\n362\n00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:56.326\nI'm gonna come in here and create one.\n\n363\n00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.626\nI'll just hit the plus sign.\n\n364\n00:17:57.626 --> 00:17:58.984\nAnd it's going to ask\nme what I'm creating.\n\n365\n00:17:58.984 --> 00:18:02.351\nI'm gonna call this my Internet Connector,\nright?\n\n366\n00:18:02.351 --> 00:18:04.906\nThis is what's gonna actually give\nme that Internet functionality.\n\n367\n00:18:04.906 --> 00:18:07.043\nAnd down here you can specify\nwhat it is your trying to do.\n\n368\n00:18:07.043 --> 00:18:09.584\nAnd they've actually got one made for\nus already, Internet.\n\n369\n00:18:09.584 --> 00:18:11.630\nWe wanna send Internet email.\n\n370\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.700\nI could choose custom and\njust put a star for\n\n371\n00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.199\nthe domain, by choosing Internet\nthat's what it's gonna do for me.\n\n372\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.470\nAll right, then I can hit Next, and\nit's gonna ask how I wanna send it.\n\n373\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.150\nNow when it comes to email,\nthere's two ways to send email.\n\n374\n00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.800\nOne way,\nis that I'm sending an email to gmail.com.\n\n375\n00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.890\nI can go to DNS,\nI can find the gmail.com domain, and\n\n376\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.120\nI can look for the mx records,\nlook for the mail exchanges, and\n\n377\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.010\nwhen I find the mail exchanges now I know\nthe server to communicate with, right?\n\n378\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.564\nThis happens all the time\nin the background.\n\n379\n00:18:40.564 --> 00:18:42.665\nHere let me just show you real quick.\n\n380\n00:18:42.665 --> 00:18:44.765\nMost of you guys probably\nalready know this but for\n\n381\n00:18:44.765 --> 00:18:48.880\nthose of you that don't let me just show\nyou a quick example of how this works.\n\n382\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.940\nSo, if I'm gonna send an email\nto somebody like Gmail, right?\n\n383\n00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.895\nSo if I have some kind of Gmail\naccount that's out there and\n\n384\n00:18:57.895 --> 00:18:59.356\nI want to send an email to it.\n\n385\n00:18:59.356 --> 00:19:03.845\nWell, what happens is, it turns around and\nlooks at the DNS and it says okay, so\n\n386\n00:19:03.845 --> 00:19:06.937\nI've got an email for\ngmail.com, where do I send it?\n\n387\n00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:10.096\nAnd in DNS it has all these MX records.\n\n388\n00:19:10.096 --> 00:19:16.180\nThese MX records, these guys right here,\nthat's what tells us who to send it too.\n\n389\n00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.934\nAnd so\nnow our server can send email there and\n\n390\n00:19:17.934 --> 00:19:19.890\nit'll get to the mail\nbox where it's destined.\n\n391\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.770\nThe problem is,\n\n392\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:27.140\nwe don't always want our server to\nbe reaching out there specifically.\n\n393\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.780\nMaybe we pay for\nemail filtering service like Postini,\n\n394\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.878\nmaybe we have an Internet service provider\nthat provides mail flow for us, right?\n\n395\n00:19:34.878 --> 00:19:37.250\nSo we wanna take the load off of our\nservers and move it somewhere else.\n\n396\n00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.799\nHere we use a Barracuda spam and\nvirus firewall, so\n\n397\n00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:42.778\nwe want all our outgoing email\nto go through that firewall.\n\n398\n00:19:42.778 --> 00:19:46.297\nDon't go directly to Gmail,\ngo to our firewall first, right?\n\n399\n00:19:46.297 --> 00:19:50.269\nAnd so for that, we can override the\ndefault behavior of using MX records and\n\n400\n00:19:50.269 --> 00:19:52.440\ntell it to use a smart host, all right?\n\n401\n00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.230\nAnd that's this option\nthat's right below here.\n\n402\n00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.825\nSo, I've got my MX record.\n\n403\n00:19:55.825 --> 00:19:59.019\nAnd then I've got route mail through\nsmart hosts, and that just says,\n\n404\n00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:01.265\ndon't go direct,\ngo through this other person.\n\n405\n00:20:01.265 --> 00:20:07.105\nAnd so you could add in the firewall or\nthird party filtering service or your ISP.\n\n406\n00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:10.880\nYou punch in their IP address here, and\nthen any outgoing email you have will just\n\n407\n00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.495\ngo to that third party provider,\nall right?\n\n408\n00:20:13.495 --> 00:20:16.191\nWell, I'm not gonna set that, I'm gonna\nstick with MX records for right now, so\n\n409\n00:20:16.191 --> 00:20:17.600\nwe'll set that up.\n\n410\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.350\nAnd then we can hit Next.\n\n411\n00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.033\nAnd then it's gonna say\nwhat the address space is.\n\n412\n00:20:22.033 --> 00:20:25.722\nNow this is gonna be an Internet\nconnector, so the address space for\n\n413\n00:20:25.722 --> 00:20:27.871\nthe Internet connector is everybody.\n\n414\n00:20:27.871 --> 00:20:31.999\nEvery domain that's out there on\nthe Internet, it's going to match this, so\n\n415\n00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:35.123\nwhen I hit Add I'm not just\ngonna punch in a regular domain,\n\n416\n00:20:35.123 --> 00:20:37.331\nI'm gonna punch in a star, an asterisk.\n\n417\n00:20:37.331 --> 00:20:39.769\nAn asterisks means every domain all right?\n\n418\n00:20:39.769 --> 00:20:43.109\nEverybody that's out there on the\nInternet, anybody that's not internal to\n\n419\n00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:46.600\nme, and internal would be like\nlab.itpro.tv in my example.\n\n420\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.550\nNow notice there's a cost, what if I have\n\n421\n00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:54.190\nmore than one send connector that matches\nan email, how does it pick a winner?\n\n422\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.330\nWell, it picks based on this cost.\n\n423\n00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:01.530\nAnd so I can define the cost of this line,\nand the lowest cost wins.\n\n424\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.980\nSo, I might have a connector\nthat runs through my span and\n\n425\n00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.790\nvirus firewall with a cost of one,\n\n426\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:11.080\nand I might have a connector that\nbypasses firewall with a cost of then.\n\n427\n00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.910\nAnd that way it always goes to\nthe firewall unless the firewall fails and\n\n428\n00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.320\nthen it moves onto the next one and\n\n429\n00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.330\nit goes through that one with\nthe higher cost and bypasses it.\n\n430\n00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:21.700\nSo, you can set up kinda redundancies that\nway, by manipulating these costs, right?\n\n431\n00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.330\nI'm just gonna leave mine at a cost of 1,\nand I'll save it.\n\n432\n00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.270\nAll right.\n\n433\n00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.890\nSo then, we do have the option\nto scope the send connector.\n\n434\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.800\nBy default, any of my email servers\nare gonna be able to use this, but\n\n435\n00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.910\nif I scope it I can limit the server.\n\n436\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.500\nNow, why would I wanna do that?\n\n437\n00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.560\nMaybe I want all of my outgoing email\n\n438\n00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.030\nto go through one particular\nclient access server.\n\n439\n00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:48.740\nSo I can set that, I can limit it\nby scoping that send connector.\n\n440\n00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.410\nBut if I just want all these\nservers to send out on their own,\n\n441\n00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.560\nI can leave that unchecked and\nthey'll do all of them.\n\n442\n00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.659\nBut that's just what's gonna dictate that\nso we can tie it to a particular system.\n\n443\n00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.460\nAll right, and on the next screen is\nwhere we pick that system, right?\n\n444\n00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.400\nWho's my source server?\n\n445\n00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.710\nAnd I can add in all of\nthose servers if I want.\n\n446\n00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.270\nSee, I've got all my client\naccess servers here.\n\n447\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.660\nOr I could add in just one,\n\n448\n00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.100\nand it's all gonna get flown right\nthrough that one system, all right?\n\n449\n00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.460\nSo in my case I'll put them both,\nhere's my two client access servers.\n\n450\n00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.140\nNow, if one server's down we can just\ngo through the other one, right?\n\n451\n00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.880\nIt can use either one,\nwe get that redundancy.\n\n452\n00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.610\nAll right.\n\n453\n00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:26.480\nOnce that's done,\nI've now created my first send connector,\n\n454\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.950\nmy Internet connector.\n\n455\n00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.010\nAnd now I can send email to the Internet,\nright?\n\n456\n00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.960\nNow outgoing email can actually go out.\n\n457\n00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.200\nEmail to internal domains can go and\nemail to external domains can go, right?\n\n458\n00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.970\nFor most people,\nyou're gonna stop right there.\n\n459\n00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.498\nYou just need one send connector.\n\n460\n00:22:40.498 --> 00:22:41.033\nYou're done.\n\n461\n00:22:41.033 --> 00:22:42.531\nNow you've got connectivity\nto the Internet.\n\n462\n00:22:42.531 --> 00:22:46.090\nBut, let's say you start doing\nbusiness with a business partner, and\n\n463\n00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.937\nyou are communicating back and\nforth with them a lot, and\n\n464\n00:22:48.937 --> 00:22:52.966\nyou want to set up a VPN tunnel, or maybe\nyou've already set up the VPN tunnel, so\n\n465\n00:22:52.966 --> 00:22:56.440\nthat you can securely\ncommunicate with their network.\n\n466\n00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.630\nWell, maybe you wan email\nto that vendor to go across\n\n467\n00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.200\nthe VPN tunnel instead of\ngoing out to the Internet.\n\n468\n00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.120\nSo I want to change the mail flow for\nthat.\n\n469\n00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.070\nI want the mail flow for\n\n470\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.010\nemail going to my business partner to go\nover this VPN tunnel instead, all right?\n\n471\n00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:14.980\nWell, for that, I can create a dedicated\nsend connector that overrides this one,\n\n472\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.920\nall right?\n\n473\n00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.480\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n474\n00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.801\nI'm gonna add in another send connector,\nand when I start to create this one,\n\n475\n00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:22.186\nI can put in what this is.\n\n476\n00:23:22.186 --> 00:23:24.902\nThis'll be my business partner, right?\n\n477\n00:23:24.902 --> 00:23:28.977\nAnd I'm gonna say that is going to be, you\ncould say custom, I'm gonna say partner,\n\n478\n00:23:28.977 --> 00:23:32.230\nso we want to route email to\na trusted third-party server, right?\n\n479\n00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.460\nNow, I can say custom and just specify\nthe destination, same thing, but\n\n480\n00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.598\nI'll go with partner, all right?\n\n481\n00:23:37.598 --> 00:23:40.150\nHere it's gonna ask to send it, all right?\n\n482\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.985\nNow it's defaulting to doing an MX record\nassociated with the recipient domain.\n\n483\n00:23:43.985 --> 00:23:47.796\nAnd notice it's not letting me pick\nthat route through a smart host, okay?\n\n484\n00:23:47.796 --> 00:23:50.759\nAnd the reason is, it's assuming if\nI've got a trusted business partner,\n\n485\n00:23:50.759 --> 00:23:53.180\nthat I've modified the MX records\nto be able to reflect that.\n\n486\n00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.310\nNow in my case, I haven't.\n\n487\n00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.522\nSo, I'm gonna back up.\n\n488\n00:23:57.522 --> 00:23:58.916\nAnd this time I'll choose Custom so\n\n489\n00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:02.380\nthat it let's me do it, cuz I don't want\nto go and modify DNS if I don't have to.\n\n490\n00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.200\nAll right, so on this one I'm gonna say,\nhey I wanna route this email through\n\n491\n00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.790\na smart host and\nI'm gonna add in who that host is.\n\n492\n00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.660\nAnd so I'll call them and I'll say,\n\n493\n00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.820\nhey on your network what's the IP\naddress of your mail server.\n\n494\n00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.020\nSo I can just send directly to it and\ncross that VPN tunnel.\n\n495\n00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.940\nAnd so they'll give you an internal IP, so\n\n496\n00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:21.360\nmaybe something like 172.16.0.100,\nor whatever it is.\n\n497\n00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.420\nMaybe you have a fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n498\n00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.350\nWhatever it is on their network\nthat you want to reach out to,\n\n499\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.610\nto that other system.\n\n500\n00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.602\nAll right, email flowing through here,\n\n501\n00:24:31.602 --> 00:24:34.605\nfor my partner's domain,\nI'm gonna send to this host.\n\n502\n00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:37.910\nAll right, then we specify\nwhether we want to authenticate.\n\n503\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.750\nI'm not gonna do authentication, it's\ngonna be encrypted over the VPN tunnel,\n\n504\n00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.320\nso we'll just send it along.\n\n505\n00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.940\nBut you might have authentication,\nthey give you a user and password and\n\n506\n00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.050\nnow you can send it along,\nyou'd specify it right here.\n\n507\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.660\nThen the address space, this is important.\n\n508\n00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.490\nI did a star when I created that Internet\none, right, every domain on the Internet.\n\n509\n00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:59.790\nBut here it's just the business partner,\nso I would add their domain name in here.\n\n510\n00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:05.070\nSo for this one it's businesspartner.net,\nor whatever their address happens to be.\n\n511\n00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.730\nSo I'm just gonna punch in that domain.\n\n512\n00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.770\nAny email that's going to\na user@businesspartner.net it's\n\n513\n00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:12.830\ngonna use this connector.\n\n514\n00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.070\nAll right, then I could add in more\nthan one if I needed to right there.\n\n515\n00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.940\nAll right then we specify what servers\nare allowed to do the connection,\n\n516\n00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.630\nand we'll probably pick all of ours.\n\n517\n00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.300\nBut you might wanna limit\nit to one in particular.\n\n518\n00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.070\nYou can do that.\n\n519\n00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.804\nMaybe not all these servers had\naccess to the VPN tunnel, so\n\n520\n00:25:28.804 --> 00:25:30.566\nI would just pick the servers that do.\n\n521\n00:25:32.749 --> 00:25:35.670\nAnd then we can finish that up, and\nyou'll see I've got a new connector.\n\n522\n00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.158\nHere's my BusinessPartner connector.\n\n523\n00:25:37.158 --> 00:25:41.120\nAny email that's going to that domain is\ngoing to get sent over to this connector.\n\n524\n00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.230\nAnd then everything else is going\nto hit my internet connector.\n\n525\n00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.250\nNow I've got outbound email\nfunctioning on my system and\n\n526\n00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.540\nthat business partner is\nbeing handled separately.\n\n527\n00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.750\nSo when it comes to send and\n\n528\n00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.980\nreceive connectors, they're a great\nway to manipulate mail flow.\n\n529\n00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.600\nHow mail comes in and how mail goes out.\n\n530\n00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.420\nAnd fortunately they're one of those\nthings where we usually set them up and\n\n531\n00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.790\nthen we never have to touch them again.\n\n532\n00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.340\nYou just ignore them and that's it.\n\n533\n00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.390\nBut, if you ever need to change\nmail flows, that's where you do it.\n\n534\n00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.480\nAll right, well in this episode we\ngot a chance to see our send and\n\n535\n00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.220\nreceive connectors.\n\n536\n00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.000\nRemember the send connectors,\nthose were how our outbound email flows.\n\n537\n00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.860\nAnd we might need to customize that if\nwe're trying to redirect business partner\n\n538\n00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.100\nstuff, or redirect all our mail to flow\nthrough a firewall or virus scan or\n\n539\n00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.300\nsomething like that.\n\n540\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.620\nOur receive connectors is\nhow our email comes in.\n\n541\n00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.550\nAnd we might need to modify those if\nwe're trying to change permissions,\n\n542\n00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.240\nauthentication.\n\n543\n00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.390\nOr if we're trying to set up exceptions,\nlike for on office printer or\n\n544\n00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.510\nother device, we may need to\nmanipulate those receive connectors.\n\n545\n00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.090\nThe other time we modify them Is\n\n546\n00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.160\nwhen we're just trying to change which\nservers are responsible for what.\n\n547\n00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.788\nBut they're very important, and\nat a minimum you're gonna need to\n\n548\n00:26:41.788 --> 00:26:44.292\ncreate one send connector to be\nable to connect to the internet.\n\n549\n00:26:44.292 --> 00:26:47.240\nOtherwise your exchange server\nis gonna be internal only.\n\n550\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.870\nSo definitely be aware of that.\n\n551\n00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.320\nBut that's a pretty good run down on\nthe two connectors, and how we use them.\n\n552\n00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.180\nSo that's all I got for this episode.\n\n553\n00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.510\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n554\n00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:59.488\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don

00:00:15.593\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.593 --> 00:00:17.393\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:20.263\nBack again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:23.973\nIn this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at Hub Transport Rules.\n\n7\n00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:26.182\nNow, hub transport rules are, I'm sorry,\n\n8\n00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:29.683\nI should actually call them by their\nnew name which is Transport Rules.\n\n9\n00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:31.553\nWe kinda got rid of that hub.\n\n10\n00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:36.198\nSo transport rules are a really neat\nservice inside of Exchange that allows us\n\n11\n00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:39.423\nto do stuff to emails that\npasses through our system.\n\n12\n00:00:39.423 --> 00:00:40.933\nAnd that's kinda neat.\n\n13\n00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.103\nLet's back this up a little bit.\n\n14\n00:00:43.103 --> 00:00:46.399\nAt the very beginning of the episode I\ncalled these hub transport rules and\n\n15\n00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.698\nthat's because in previous versions\nof Exchange you have what was called\n\n16\n00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:51.110\na Hub Transport Server.\n\n17\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.300\nAnd that server was responsible for\napplying hub transport rules.\n\n18\n00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.460\nWell, in new Exchange 2013 at least, you\ndon't have a hub transport server anymore.\n\n19\n00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.312\nNow you have a hub transport service, so\n\n20\n00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:06.018\nits not a dedicated server its a service\nthat runs right on your mailbox servers,\n\n21\n00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:09.778\nand so that's why Microsoft said you know\nwhat we're gonna take the hub transport\n\n22\n00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:13.470\nrole over we're just gonna drop the hub\noff and we'll call it a transport rule.\n\n23\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.660\nWhen email is being transported\nthrough your system,\n\n24\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.890\nyou can define rules that apply to it.\n\n25\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.948\nNow a lot of us use rules like these all\nthe time anyway you have Outlook rules,\n\n26\n00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:23.720\nInbox rules.\n\n27\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.960\nI might have rules that say if\nI get an email from Ronnie,\n\n28\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.520\nsend it to my recycle bin.\n\n29\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.390\nOr if I get an email from somebody else,\nI might forward it along, or\n\n30\n00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.230\ndo think you'll put it\nin a particular folder.\n\n31\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.020\nThese are rules that we can dictate\nthat say what happens to email.\n\n32\n00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.550\nWell, a transport rule is the same thing,\nexcept it's done at the server level.\n\n33\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.730\nSo it can be applied to all email\npassing through your organization, and\n\n34\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.130\nthat's pretty important, right?\n\n35\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.740\nThat means we can do a lot of\nreally cool stuff with it.\n\n36\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.160\nNow, one of the neat things we have\nwith the Exchanges Design, is that\n\n37\n00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.810\nevery single email, 100% of your email,\npasses through the hub transport service.\n\n38\n00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.760\nIt has to.\n\n39\n00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.320\nAnd every mailbox server in Exchange\n2013 is a hub transport service system.\n\n40\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.910\nIt's all running a copy\nof the transport service.\n\n41\n00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.400\nSo if it's an inside email going out,\nif it's an outside email coming in,\n\n42\n00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.720\nif it's two internal users emailing each\nother, now it doesn't go outside at all.\n\n43\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.640\nIt still goes through the hub transport\nservice on a mailbox server somewhere.\n\n44\n00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.910\nAnd the odds are it's gonna pass through\nthe hub transport service on more than one\n\n45\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.390\nserver as it moves around to get to\nthe destination where it needs to be.\n\n46\n00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.260\nSo the hub transport service is in\na unique position, it's the only service\n\n47\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.140\nof all the services in exchange that\nactually sees 100% of the email.\n\n48\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.850\nIt sees it all.\n\n49\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.900\nSo that's what gives it that unique\nability to create these rules.\n\n50\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.830\nBack in the old days, you used to\nhave where Microsoft Outlook could\n\n51\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.560\ndirectly contact the mailbox database.\n\n52\n00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.220\nAnd that meant there was no way to\napply rules to it at the server and\n\n53\n00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.020\nthat created a lot of issues.\n\n54\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.810\nOr if we did we had to create rules and\n\n55\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.390\nsynchronize them across all\nthe servers and it was a nightmare.\n\n56\n00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.860\nWell now we don't have that problem,\n\n57\n00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.090\nbecause all email without exception\ngoes thru the hub transport rule, or\n\n58\n00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.710\nhub transport service, and\nthat's where we can apply these rules.\n\n59\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.370\nWell, let me show you\nwhere these rules are and\n\n60\n00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.670\nthen we'll talk about some the different\nthings we can do with them.\n\n61\n00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.638\nSo here I'm logged into my Exchange\nAdministration Center, and in the EAC if\n\n62\n00:03:13.638 --> 00:03:19.370\nyou login and you go down to mail flow,\ninside of mail flow you'll see rules.\n\n63\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.240\nIt's the first tab, and\n\n64\n00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.790\nit's usually chosen by default\nthat I've clicked off of it here.\n\n65\n00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.100\nBut you can go into rules, and\nyou can see rules that you have.\n\n66\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.730\nNow by default, there's no rules.\n\n67\n00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.190\nAny email is allowed to come in,\nany email is allowed to go out, and\n\n68\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.770\nit does so unmodified.\n\n69\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.660\nWe don't touch them at all,\nthey just flow through.\n\n70\n00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.990\nThat's the default.\n\n71\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.720\nThen it's up to us to come through and\nconfigure what we want to have happen.\n\n72\n00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.840\nWhat are some examples of what\nwe might want to have happen?\n\n73\n00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.320\nWell, a great example is that we might\nwant to apply a legal disclaimer to\n\n74\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.120\nour email.\n\n75\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.730\nI'm sure you guys have\nreceived one of those before.\n\n76\n00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.130\nYou get an email and you read it and then\nright below the person's signature is this\n\n77\n00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.730\nbig disclaimer, and it says this email\nis intended for the recipient only.\n\n78\n00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.870\nIf you've received this email in error,\nplease delete it.\n\n79\n00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.830\nSomething like that.\n\n80\n00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.310\nIt's just junk, legal stuff, and if you've\never wondered why people even bother with\n\n81\n00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.240\nthat, it's called due diligence.\n\n82\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.750\nIf they ever take somebody to court for\nhaving information they shouldn't have and\n\n83\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.340\nthat person says, well,\nyou accidentally sent me this email.\n\n84\n00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.290\nThey can say, well we put a disclaimer\nright at the bottom that says you're\n\n85\n00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.400\nnot supposed to have that.\n\n86\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.070\nSo we did our due diligence and\nnow they can take you to court.\n\n87\n00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.390\nIf they didn't do that then\nthey couldn't go to cour.\n\n88\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.250\nSo it's really just for\nlitigation purposes.\n\n89\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.860\nMost of the time we don't\nreally care about it.\n\n90\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.760\nBut it is an important thing to have.\n\n91\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.610\nWell, how will we make sure that all of\nour users are putting the legal disclaimer\n\n92\n00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.730\non their email?\n\n93\n00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.880\nThe short answer is you can't.\n\n94\n00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.980\nYou can't trust your users\nto do it all the time, so\n\n95\n00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.800\ninstead, we can use a transport rule\nto do it, that says anytime an email\n\n96\n00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.770\npasses through our system,\nstick this disclaimer on the bottom.\n\n97\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.910\nIt's a really simple process.\n\n98\n00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.070\nLet me show you how it works.\n\n99\n00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.920\nWe can go in here and\nwe can create a rule.\n\n100\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.810\nAnd when you create a rule, the very\nfirst option is create a new rule.\n\n101\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.060\nAnd that's the one that gives\nyou full capability to pick and\n\n102\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.320\nchoose exactly what you\nwant this rule to do.\n\n103\n00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.070\nAll the other ones are templates.\n\n104\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.090\nMicrosoft includes about ten templates\nhere that are common things that you might\n\n105\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.220\nwant to do.\n\n106\n00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.920\nSo I mentioned attaching\na legal disclaimer.\n\n107\n00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.280\nWell, that's actually option number\nthree here, apply disclaimers.\n\n108\n00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.330\nNow I could choose create new rule.\n\n109\n00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.080\nAnd create this myself by hand.\n\n110\n00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.270\nBut because they've given me a template,\nI can just use that.\n\n111\n00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.323\nNow, when I click on the template,\nit's really no different than if\n\n112\n00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:27.970\nI created the rule myself, except it's\nalready got some values filled in for me.\n\n113\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.470\nNow what is it filling in?\n\n114\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.140\nWhen you make a rule,\nthe rule is made up of three parts.\n\n115\n00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.080\nThe first part is a condition, and you'll\nhear Microsoft refer to it as a predicate\n\n116\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.400\nsometimes on the exam you\nmight see that word predicate.\n\n117\n00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.210\nIt's just conditions.\n\n118\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.080\nWhat emails will this policy apply to?\n\n119\n00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.050\nWe don't normally want a rule\nto apply to a 100% of our email.\n\n120\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.630\nSo for example,\nif I'm attaching a legal disclaimer,\n\n121\n00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.590\na legal disclaimer needs to be attached\nto emails that I'm sending out.\n\n122\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.840\nIf it's an internal user sending it to an\noutside user, I want the disclaimer there.\n\n123\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.960\nBut what if it's an internal user\nsending to another internal user?\n\n124\n00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.600\nDo I need the disclaimer there?\n\n125\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.050\nMaybe.\n\n126\n00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.700\nBut it's up to me,\nit's up to my environment.\n\n127\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.700\nIt's kinda situational.\n\n128\n00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.020\nI have to pick whether or not I want that.\n\n129\n00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.580\nOr what if it's an outside\nemail coming in?\n\n130\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.740\nIt's an email somebody\nelse sent coming in to me.\n\n131\n00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.956\nDo I wanna attach a disclaimer there?\n\n132\n00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:19.115\nProbably not.\n\n133\n00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:23.885\nSo we define conditions,\nlet's say what emails they apply to.\n\n134\n00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:26.365\nThen we define actions.\n\n135\n00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:28.025\nAnd actions are what we're gonna do to it.\n\n136\n00:06:28.025 --> 00:06:29.825\nIn this case we're gonna pin some text and\nemail.\n\n137\n00:06:30.935 --> 00:06:35.315\nAnd then lastly there's an optional\nthird part which are exceptions.\n\n138\n00:06:35.315 --> 00:06:37.785\nYour conditions may grab a lot of email,\nand\n\n139\n00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:41.390\nthen you do exceptions to exclude\ncertain traffic from that rule.\n\n140\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.120\nSo you can specify all that.\n\n141\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.350\nIt's all in three parts.\n\n142\n00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.820\nConditions, actions, exceptions.\n\n143\n00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.210\nNow on the screen, when we look at it\nby default, you only see conditions and\n\n144\n00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.020\nactions.\n\n145\n00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.300\nThe exceptions are hidden away\nunder this more options button.\n\n146\n00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.060\nAnd I'll be honest with you guys.\n\n147\n00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.230\nJust get used to hitting\nthat more options button,\n\n148\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.490\nbecause when you look at things\nlike the do the following.\n\n149\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.790\nDo the following, that's the action\nthat we take, if I drop that down,\n\n150\n00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.900\nsee how I only see like six actions,\nthat's not very exciting.\n\n151\n00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.330\nI can forward the message for approval,\n\n152\n00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.740\nI can redirect the message,\nI can reject the message,\n\n153\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.140\ndelete the message, blind copy the message\nor append a disclaimer and that's it.\n\n154\n00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.120\nJust six things.\n\n155\n00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.460\nThat's not exciting.\n\n156\n00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:29.100\nBut if you click on more options, now\nthat do the following has a lot of stuff.\n\n157\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.890\nAnd a lot of these have arrows that\nbranch out into even more things.\n\n158\n00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.140\nYou'll see there's a ton of options\nin here and a ton of power.\n\n159\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.520\nSo just get used to hitting more options.\n\n160\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.820\nYou're pretty much gonna\nneed that all the time.\n\n161\n00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.220\nBut, when you go in here and\n\n162\n00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.310\nstart to define this rule,\nyou're telling it what you want it to do.\n\n163\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.328\nLet me go back to this simple screen,\nwhere I'm just applying a disclaimer.\n\n164\n00:07:47.328 --> 00:07:50.227\nThe first part is, well,\nI do need to give it a name, so\n\n165\n00:07:50.227 --> 00:07:52.766\nI'm just gonna call this\nmy legal disclaimer.\n\n166\n00:07:52.766 --> 00:07:56.717\nAnd then apply this rule if,\nthese are my conditions.\n\n167\n00:07:56.717 --> 00:07:58.359\nWho does this apply to?\n\n168\n00:07:58.359 --> 00:08:01.740\nAnd if I'm doing a legal disclaimer,\nI might wanna just come in here and say,\n\n169\n00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.140\napply to all messages.\n\n170\n00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.173\nI want this to apply to\n100% of the messages.\n\n171\n00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:08.120\nBut there's a little problem there.\n\n172\n00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:13.150\nMy problem is I don't necessarily want\nit to apply to outside emails coming in.\n\n173\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.870\nSo now, I need to make a choice.\n\n174\n00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.760\nThe choice is kind of a difficult one.\n\n175\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.140\nSometimes I can get my\nemail selected right here\n\n176\n00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.640\nwithout having to do exceptions.\n\n177\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.340\nOther times, I have to use an exception.\n\n178\n00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.960\nSo we kind of have to fiddle with this a\nbit to find out which one's gonna work in\n\n179\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.500\nour scenario and\neverybody's scenario is different.\n\n180\n00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.320\nSo it's not a one size fits all.\n\n181\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.050\nYou've really got to tune\nthis to your own environment.\n\n182\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:39.400\nSo if I want this to apply to every email,\nbe it internal or\n\n183\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.480\ninside going out, I just don't want it\nto apply to outside people coming in.\n\n184\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.940\nI could drop this down and\npick from the different lists.\n\n185\n00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.154\nAnd you'll see things like if\nthe sender is dot dot dot.\n\n186\n00:08:51.154 --> 00:08:52.528\nWhen you see the ellipses,\n\n187\n00:08:52.528 --> 00:08:56.270\nthe three dots, that's your hint\nthat there's more to this one.\n\n188\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.680\nSo I can say apply this\nrule if the sender is, and\n\n189\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.820\nI could pick a particular person or\na group.\n\n190\n00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.090\nAnd so now, it's just going to\napply to that individual person.\n\n191\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.792\nWell I wanna grab all of\nmy internal users and\n\n192\n00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:09.361\nI don't have a good way of doing it here.\n\n193\n00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:10.731\nSo I'm gonna cancel that.\n\n194\n00:09:10.731 --> 00:09:13.339\nAnd then I'll look and\nsee if the sender is located,\n\n195\n00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:16.190\nthat would be if they're\nin a particular place.\n\n196\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.870\nIf the sender is a member of some group\nbut I don't have a good group for that.\n\n197\n00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.330\nIf the sender address includes well,\nall right.\n\n198\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.700\nSo maybe I could do my domains but\nif I have a bunch of domains,\n\n199\n00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.730\nthat's kind of a hassle.\n\n200\n00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.950\nSo none of these really help me for\ngetting just internal employees.\n\n201\n00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.420\nSo I'm gonna choose Apply to all Messages.\n\n202\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.533\nAnd then I'll create an exception for\n\n203\n00:09:36.533 --> 00:09:39.644\nwhen the sender is outside\nwhen the sender is external.\n\n204\n00:09:39.644 --> 00:09:42.344\nSometimes you have to use an exception\nsometimes you can get away\n\n205\n00:09:42.344 --> 00:09:44.100\nwithout using one.\n\n206\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.150\nAnd then I'm gonna do the following.\n\n207\n00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.220\nI'm going to append a disclaimer.\n\n208\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.760\nNow, when you choose append a disclaimer\n\n209\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.200\nover here it's got\nan option to enter in text.\n\n210\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.740\nSo that what I need to do.\n\n211\n00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.180\nSo I'm going to hit Enter text and\nI'm gonna specify that disclaimer text.\n\n212\n00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.910\nSo I'll just say something like,\nwe can be really detailed here,\n\n213\n00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.360\nwe can say whatever it is.\n\n214\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.190\nI'll just say do not read this email.\n\n215\n00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.040\nThat's the easy way to be safe.\n\n216\n00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.720\nWe told you not to read it,\nand you read it.\n\n217\n00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.550\nSo there we go.\n\n218\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.620\nSo you can define your disclaimer with\nwhatever syntax your legal department\n\n219\n00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.480\ngives you, you punch it in there.\n\n220\n00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.970\nSo, that's what we're gonna be doing\nright there, appending that disclaimer.\n\n221\n00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.520\nNow, I need to do an exception, and\nexceptions don't show up by default.\n\n222\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.710\nSo I'm gonna have to go to more options.\n\n223\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.470\nBut before I do that,\n\n224\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.540\nlet me talk about some of these\nother things that we've got here.\n\n225\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.150\nWe've got audit this rule.\n\n226\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.600\nDo we want to do logging for this rule?\n\n227\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.761\nAnd you might.\n\n228\n00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:40.410\nIf this is some kind of security\nconcern then we might need to log it or\n\n229\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.830\nif we're just doing testing,\nyou might want to log it today.\n\n230\n00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.570\nBut you'll see on here we've\ngot options for testing too.\n\n231\n00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.680\nYou got enforce, that means the rule\nis active and applying to the system.\n\n232\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.030\nAnd you've got testing.\n\n233\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.020\nTesting doesn't actually apply the rule.\n\n234\n00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.870\nThe rule is sort of in effect,\nyou won't be attaching legal disclaimers.\n\n235\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:04.280\nIf you choose test with policy tips,\nthen when you draft an email, you'll see\n\n236\n00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.270\na mail tip appear that will tell you what\nwould happen if this policy was enforced.\n\n237\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.420\nSo that's one way to do it.\n\n238\n00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.200\nIf you choose test without policy tips,\nevery time this policy would apply,\n\n239\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.980\nit will send you an email\nletting you know.\n\n240\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.780\nIt's a good way to test.\n\n241\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.310\nBoth of those require connecting\nup with Office 365 though.\n\n242\n00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.320\nAnd so if you're running in\na standalone environment,\n\n243\n00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.450\nthese two tests are not really useful.\n\n244\n00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.570\nSo if you're trying to test the rule and\n\n245\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.590\nyou want to really throttle it down,\nyou should set up a apply this rule and\n\n246\n00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.580\nlimit it just to your account or just to a\ntest account and test the rule with that.\n\n247\n00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.420\nAnd then switch it to apply to all\nmessages and then you're taken care of.\n\n248\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.180\nSo I'm gonna hit more options though,\ncuz I need to set an exception.\n\n249\n00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:48.230\nAnd now, you'll see apply this rule if,\nthat's my condition, do the following,\n\n250\n00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.190\nthat's my action, and except if,\nthere's my exceptions.\n\n251\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.009\nAnd I'm gonna add an exception, and\nI'm gonna say, if the sender and\n\n252\n00:11:56.009 --> 00:11:59.765\nthen notice I've got some nice little\noptions in here like this one,\n\n253\n00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:01.939\nif the sender is external or internal.\n\n254\n00:12:01.939 --> 00:12:03.570\nI'm gonna choose that.\n\n255\n00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.055\nAnd I'm gonna choose if\nthe sender is outside.\n\n256\n00:12:06.055 --> 00:12:10.460\nIf this isn't email being sent from\nsomebody outside my organization.\n\n257\n00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.050\nI don't want to attach a legal\ndisclaimer to their stuff.\n\n258\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.360\nI want it attached to mine.\n\n259\n00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.210\nSo now,\ninternal users will have this apply.\n\n260\n00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.010\nSo inside email going out or\ninside email going to inside people.\n\n261\n00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.637\nBut outside email coming in,\nthis rule won't apply.\n\n262\n00:12:25.637 --> 00:12:29.102\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nsave my rule and now it's saying,\n\n263\n00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:31.920\ndo I wanna apply this\nto all future messages?\n\n264\n00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.480\nAnd I'll say yes, and\nlooks like I got a problem.\n\n265\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.710\nIt says I got an error here.\n\n266\n00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.520\nPlease fix the highlighted fields and\ntry saving again.\n\n267\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.610\nOh, my fallback option.\n\n268\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.090\nUp here I've got this legal disclaimer,\nand I didn't set a fallback option.\n\n269\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.600\nSee how it lit up in red?\n\n270\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.050\nSo what do you do if it fails\nto attach the legal disclaimer?\n\n271\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.460\nSomething could happen.\n\n272\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.750\nIf the email is encrypted,\ncan we attach a legal disclaimer?\n\n273\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.330\nKind of hard to do that.\n\n274\n00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.250\nSo there's situations where it might fail.\n\n275\n00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.710\nSo what do we do if it fails?\n\n276\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.670\nWell you can hit select one and\nyou can pick an option.\n\n277\n00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.750\nAnd we can say rapid,\nwhich means just stick the disclaimer on\n\n278\n00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.450\nafter the encrypted stuff,\nyou can do that.\n\n279\n00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.950\nOr we can say ignore it.\n\n280\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.690\nJust let the email go through without\na legal disclaimer or we can reject it.\n\n281\n00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.830\nAnd if that legal disclaimer is there,\n\n282\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.470\nif your legal department has asked you\nto do that, it's pretty important.\n\n283\n00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.360\nWe probably wanna reject the email.\n\n284\n00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.210\nIf we can't attach the disclaimer,\nwe need to reject it.\n\n285\n00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.190\nSo these are the options that we have to\npick and now that I've got that said I\n\n286\n00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.588\nshould be able to save my rule and\nWill have this rule.\n\n287\n00:13:35.588 --> 00:13:40.530\nSo now, 100% of the emails that\nare moving through my organization\n\n288\n00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.610\nget this rule applied to them and if the\nsender is outside it doesn't do anything.\n\n289\n00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.690\nBut if the sender is internal,\nthis rule applies and\n\n290\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.310\nit will append that disclaimer.\n\n291\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.020\nNow as you create rules, you're going to\nnotice this priority filed over here and\n\n292\n00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.150\nthis one got a priority of zero.\n\n293\n00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:00.180\nAs you create the rules, the priority\ndetermines the order they're applied in.\n\n294\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.530\nAnd so as they go through,\nit starts at the top and it goes down.\n\n295\n00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.560\nYou wanna have more than one rule\nthat applies to the same email.\n\n296\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.688\nIt's very common.\n\n297\n00:14:07.688 --> 00:14:09.240\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n298\n00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.840\nNow, if you've got a rule that\nrejects email for some reason.\n\n299\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.840\nThen you might wanna choose to\nstop processing rules and say,\n\n300\n00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.820\ndon't process any more rules cuz you're\njust wasting resources at that point.\n\n301\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.410\nYou're already gonna reject the email.\n\n302\n00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.510\nAnd so that option was in there when\nwe were in the advanced settings.\n\n303\n00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.890\nIt's buried in there that you can tell\nit to stop processing after this rule.\n\n304\n00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.210\nIf I scroll down here it is.\n\n305\n00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.880\nStop processing more rules.\n\n306\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.970\nSo if this rule results in an email\nbeing rejected then I don't wanna\n\n307\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.141\nprocess anything else after that.\n\n308\n00:14:37.141 --> 00:14:38.270\nIt's just wasting time.\n\n309\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.270\nI can turn that on.\n\n310\n00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.560\nBut most of the time we want that off.\n\n311\n00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.330\nWe want all of our rules to apply\ncuz it might not be this rule that\n\n312\n00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.060\nrejects the email.\n\n313\n00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.370\nIt might be another rule that does so\n\n314\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.830\nwe gotta give it a chance to\nget through all those rules.\n\n315\n00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.010\nBut it means the order of\nthese rules is important.\n\n316\n00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.060\nAnd so you'll see my up and\n\n317\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.430\ndown arrows where we can change\nthe order they're applied in.\n\n318\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.960\nSo just be aware that it's\napplied from top to bottom.\n\n319\n00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.740\nIn this order.\n\n320\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.781\nSo now, emails passing through my\norganization are gonna get a legal\n\n321\n00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:04.580\ndisclaimer attached to them.\n\n322\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.010\nThat's one example of something\nI can do with a transport rule.\n\n323\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:08.960\nWhat are some other examples?\n\n324\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.130\nWell actually here,\nlet's see if this one even works first.\n\n325\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.929\nSo if I go in and draft a new email,\nso I'm gonna create a new email here.\n\n326\n00:15:15.929 --> 00:15:21.510\nAnd I'm gonna email Jane Smith, and I'll\njust call this my legal disclaimer test.\n\n327\n00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.650\nThis is testing my legal disclaimer.\n\n328\n00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.620\nSo this email is going to\npass through my server.\n\n329\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.870\nIt's going to pass through my hub\ntransport service, and the transport\n\n330\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.770\nrule is going to apply, legal disclaimer\nshould get attached beneath it.\n\n331\n00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.650\nSo I might have my own email signature or\nwhatever.\n\n332\n00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.571\nAnd then I send that along, and\nwe'll see what happens after that.\n\n333\n00:15:43.571 --> 00:15:46.542\nWhile we're waiting on that,\nwe can go into our other rules, and\n\n334\n00:15:46.542 --> 00:15:47.957\nwe can create some other ones.\n\n335\n00:15:47.957 --> 00:15:49.280\nAnother example of something we might do.\n\n336\n00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.932\nDisclaimers are popular.\n\n337\n00:15:50.932 --> 00:15:52.859\nBlocking attachments.\n\n338\n00:15:52.859 --> 00:15:57.241\nMaybe I'm worried about people\nopening Visual Basic scripts or\n\n339\n00:15:57.241 --> 00:15:59.600\nexecutables, things like that.\n\n340\n00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.130\nWell, Microsoft Outlook actually has\nits own attachment screen in place,\n\n341\n00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.350\nso we don't normally\nhave to worry about that.\n\n342\n00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.550\nBut we can create our own\nrules that are very specific.\n\n343\n00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.365\nThings like limiting based on size.\n\n344\n00:16:10.365 --> 00:16:13.813\nI might want to set it where some users\ncan receive emails that are a 100MB in\n\n345\n00:16:13.813 --> 00:16:16.960\nsize, others only 50MB and\nI can use transport rules to do that too.\n\n346\n00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.740\nLet me show you.\n\n347\n00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.020\nSo if I add a new rule here,\nI don't have a rule.\n\n348\n00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.960\nWell, I guess I have\nfilter by message size.\n\n349\n00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.320\nI could maybe do that one.\n\n350\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.890\nBut I'm not so concerned about the message\nitself as I am the attachments.\n\n351\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.230\nSo this one doesn't specifically\nsingle out attachments.\n\n352\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.230\nSo I'm gonna go to create new rule and\ncreate my own from scratch.\n\n353\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:41.440\nAnd I'll call this one, maybe we'll say\nblock VBS attachments right I just don't\n\n354\n00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.917\nwant people sending in VBS or whatever\nattachment it is that we want to block.\n\n355\n00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.650\nApply this rule if,\nI'm going to apply this to all messages.\n\n356\n00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.400\nI wanna filter every message for\nthis attachment type.\n\n357\n00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.589\nAnd then do the following, we'll see\nthe list here of what we want to do.\n\n358\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.320\nActually, I need to change that.\n\n359\n00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.760\nI don't want this to apply to every email.\n\n360\n00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.210\nI want it to apply to emails\nthat have a VBS attachment.\n\n361\n00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.400\nThat's kind of important,\nso I need to change that.\n\n362\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.610\nAnd as I look here I've got Any\nattachment content includes.\n\n363\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:12.490\nWell, I'm not worried about\nthe content of the attachment,\n\n364\n00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.150\nI'm worried about the file extension,\nand that's not gonna do.\n\n365\n00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:20.060\nSo I'm gonna need to go into my More\noptions and under more options I can say\n\n366\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.810\nIf any attachment, and\nnow I see a lot more options.\n\n367\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.390\nIf the content includes certain words or\npatterns.\n\n368\n00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.440\nIf the file name matches a pattern.\n\n369\n00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.430\nIf the file extension includes\nthese words that's what I want.\n\n370\n00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.700\nAnd now we can add in whatever we want.\n\n371\n00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:40.490\nI'll add in VBS, BAT, CMD, EXE,\nanything that I want to filter out.\n\n372\n00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.020\nNow I do know Outlook's\nalready doing this, but\n\n373\n00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.820\nwhat if I'm not connecting with Outlook?\n\n374\n00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.530\nWhat if I'm connecting with some\nthird-party mail client that doesn't have\n\n375\n00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:48.850\nthat kind of filter in place?\n\n376\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.760\nWell, here we can do it\nas a transport rule and\n\n377\n00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.160\nwe'll knock it out before it\neven gets to their mailbox.\n\n378\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.340\nSo it never even makes it to\nthe mailbox doing it this way.\n\n379\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.560\nSo now I can say if the attachment\nincludes one of those things\n\n380\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.930\nwe're gonna block it, and now I need\nto specify that here for the action.\n\n381\n00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.400\nNow when you block it you\nneed to make a choice.\n\n382\n00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.030\nThere's two ways to block an email.\n\n383\n00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.540\nYou can silently block it.\n\n384\n00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.030\nYou just delete it and\nthrow it away and nobody knows.\n\n385\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.460\nOr you can block it and send a message to\nthe sender so they know what happened.\n\n386\n00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.360\nAnd you can say hey, sorry,\nthat attachment type's not allowed.\n\n387\n00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.480\nSo we can let them know, and so\n\n388\n00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.360\nwhen you look at blocked messages\nyou'll see reject and delete.\n\n389\n00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.840\nDelete is that silent block.\n\n390\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.000\nIt will silently delete it and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n391\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.140\nReject, we can send it back\nwith the enhanced status code.\n\n392\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.000\nAnd boy, that's a pleasure to read,\nit means nothing to the users.\n\n393\n00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.510\nOr we can say reject the message and\ninclude an explanation.\n\n394\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.500\nAnd we can specify the file type\n\n395\n00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:46.280\nattached to the message is not allowed.\n\n396\n00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.870\nSo we can specify that.\n\n397\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.100\nYou don't have to reject it though.\n\n398\n00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.350\nThere's actually an option in here\nsomewhere, we'll have to hunt for it,\n\n399\n00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.700\nwhere you can strip the attachment.\n\n400\n00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.740\nWhere you can say send it along\njust without an attachment on it.\n\n401\n00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.290\nIt's buried in here somewhere.\n\n402\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.830\nBut we'll just leave it right here,\nsend that message and let people know.\n\n403\n00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.320\nAnd I can put in exceptions if I wanted,\nbut I don't need to.\n\n404\n00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:10.340\nOh, in the chat room, Guido mentioned\nJAR files, those Java archives.\n\n405\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.570\nThose might be another\none that we want to add.\n\n406\n00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.090\nThere's a ton of different\nones we might want to add.\n\n407\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.570\nSo we can punch that in,\nI'm gonna block those attachments.\n\n408\n00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.490\nAnd now if somebody tries to send one\nof those, it's going to get blocked and\n\n409\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.490\nthey'll get a message\nsaying why it was blocked.\n\n410\n00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:26.390\nSince I didn't filter any exceptions,\nit's gonna apply to everybody.\n\n411\n00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.620\nOutside users emailing in,\ninside users mailing out and so on.\n\n412\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.200\nIt's gonna do that.\n\n413\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.730\nNow if I'm blocking those attachments and\nrejecting the message,\n\n414\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.710\nI might wanna move this one up to the top\nso it applies before the legal disclaimer.\n\n415\n00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.870\nNow why would I do that?\n\n416\n00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:44.010\nWell, I don't wanna attach to a disclaimer\nto an email that I'm just gonna reject.\n\n417\n00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.920\nWhy go through the trouble\nof attaching that?\n\n418\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.130\nIt's a waste of time.\n\n419\n00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.635\nAnd if I'm gonna reject the email anyway,\n\n420\n00:19:50.635 --> 00:19:53.995\nI might wanna stop processing\nrules after that if it matches.\n\n421\n00:19:53.995 --> 00:19:57.585\nSo there's a couple of different things\nyou can do here to optimize your system.\n\n422\n00:19:57.585 --> 00:20:00.465\nAgain, you'll have to tweak it a bit for\nyour environment to get the best mix.\n\n423\n00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:03.665\nAll right,\nwhat else can we do with this thing?\n\n424\n00:20:03.665 --> 00:20:07.095\nOh, email whitelist and blacklists.\n\n425\n00:20:07.095 --> 00:20:11.540\nIn Exchange, in Microsoft Outlook,\nyou have an SCL, a spam confidence level.\n\n426\n00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.100\nSo it looks at an email and\n\n427\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.300\nbased on the contents of the email it\nassigns a spam confidence level and\n\n428\n00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.460\nif the spam level is high enough\nit'll get sent to your junk mail.\n\n429\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.680\nWell, I might have emails that\nI want to go to junk mail or\n\n430\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.950\nI might have emails that I\ndon't want to go to junk mail.\n\n431\n00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.172\nSo we can intercept those messages and\nwe can adjust their SCL.\n\n432\n00:20:29.172 --> 00:20:31.060\nLet me show you how it works.\n\n433\n00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.520\nAnd let's say it's a whitelist.\n\n434\n00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.340\nI want to say any email coming from\nme doesn't get flagged as spam.\n\n435\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.090\nSo I can create a new rule, and\nthere's actually a template for this one.\n\n436\n00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.990\nNotice there's Bypass spam filtering,\nso you can choose that one and\n\n437\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.060\nit'll do the same thing.\n\n438\n00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:50.780\nBut basically you create a rule, and\nI'll call this my Email Whitelist,\n\n439\n00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.890\nand I can apply the rule if, and here's\nwhere I can specify a particular sender,\n\n440\n00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:01.230\nand I can say the sender is this person,\nand I could add in myself.\n\n441\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.130\nSo if the sender's me,\nI want this rule to apply.\n\n442\n00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.250\nAnd you can add more conditions.\n\n443\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:10.260\nI could add other conditions\nin here to say, and\n\n444\n00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.320\nthe sender's in this group or whatever.\n\n445\n00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.629\nYou can get really\nspecific with this stuff.\n\n446\n00:21:13.629 --> 00:21:17.775\nBut I'm gonna say if the sender is me,\nand you could add more here too,\n\n447\n00:21:17.775 --> 00:21:22.690\nsaying like Don Pezet or Ronnie Wong or\nwhoever, add each one in there.\n\n448\n00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:23.656\nAnd then do the following.\n\n449\n00:21:23.656 --> 00:21:28.690\nAnd see how it's saying, set the spam\nconfidence level to Bypass spam filtering.\n\n450\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.150\nIf you look at it you\ncan set it from Bypass,\n\n451\n00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:34.650\nwhich is always gonna get through,\nor 0 through 9.\n\n452\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.130\nIf you set it to 9,\nyou're creating a blacklist.\n\n453\n00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.740\nThis email will go to spam.\n\n454\n00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.070\nOr you could really just reject\nit at that point if you want, but\n\n455\n00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.570\ngoing to spam is usually a little better.\n\n456\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.140\nCuz the end users can still get\nto the email if they need it.\n\n457\n00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.150\nSo if I'm doing a blacklist\nI'd choose that.\n\n458\n00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.250\nBut a whitelist I'd wanna set to 0 or\nbypass.\n\n459\n00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.010\nBypass just means send it\nright to their mailbox,\n\n460\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.330\ndon't put it in junk mail, and let it go.\n\n461\n00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.450\nSo couple of different ways that we can\ngo about that one, but I'll leave it as\n\n462\n00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:01.310\nbypass and then I could put in exceptions\nif I want to, but I'm not going to.\n\n463\n00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.550\nI'll save that and\nnow emails from me will automatically\n\n464\n00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.320\nbypass the spam confidence level and\ngo into people's mailboxes.\n\n465\n00:22:10.232 --> 00:22:13.720\nAll right, let's see,\na couple other things that we can do.\n\n466\n00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.520\nWe did have a question\nin the chat room about\n\n467\n00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.020\nfile attachments if they\nchange the extension.\n\n468\n00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.370\nThat rule that I made a minute ago\nwas looking at the file extension.\n\n469\n00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.060\nWhat if a user changes the file extension?\n\n470\n00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.040\nWell, that kind of defeats this.\n\n471\n00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.460\nThis is fairly simplistic.\n\n472\n00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.300\nIt's really just looking\nat that extension.\n\n473\n00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.110\nAnd that's where we need\nmalware protection.\n\n474\n00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.860\nWe'll talk about the malware protection\nin another episode, where it can actually\n\n475\n00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.060\nscan those attachments to see what they\nare, regardless of what the extension is.\n\n476\n00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.830\nBut yeah,\nthese are somewhat simplistic on that.\n\n477\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.730\nAll right, tagging bulk mail.\n\n478\n00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.320\nIf I'm receiving mailing lists.\n\n479\n00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.790\nNo, this is kind of a fun one.\n\n480\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:53.340\nIf I get a lot of email spam,\nnot email spam, but just bulk mailings,\n\n481\n00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.660\nwe could go ahead and tag those to make\nit easier for users to recognize that.\n\n482\n00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.600\nThere's certain keywords you can look for.\n\n483\n00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.680\nA great example is unsubscribe.\n\n484\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:05.550\nIf you see the word unsubscribe in\nthe email, the odds are it's bulk mail.\n\n485\n00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.510\nIf I send you an email personally,\nam I gonna have unsubscribe in that?\n\n486\n00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:11.890\nNo, you're not gonna unsubscribe from\nme sending you a personal email.\n\n487\n00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.150\nBut if I'm a bulk mailer, if I'm sending\nyou an advertisement I'm required by law\n\n488\n00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:16.910\nto have the word unsubscribe there.\n\n489\n00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.130\nAnd even the malicious guys will put\nthe word unsubscribe in there and\n\n490\n00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.790\nthey'll link to their own spam site or\nwhatever.\n\n491\n00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.330\nBut you could key off of that word and\nsay if the email message body contains\n\n492\n00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.685\nthe word unsubscribe,\nset the spam confidence level to seven.\n\n493\n00:23:29.685 --> 00:23:31.660\nThere's a good chance that this is spam.\n\n494\n00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.130\nOr one of my favorites is you can\nappend something to the subject line.\n\n495\n00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.586\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n496\n00:23:36.586 --> 00:23:41.539\nSo I'm going to create a rule here,\nand I'll call this Bulk Mailings,\n\n497\n00:23:41.539 --> 00:23:45.685\nand I can apply the rule if I'm\ngoing to look for something.\n\n498\n00:23:45.685 --> 00:23:48.932\nI might say if the subject or\nbody includes And\n\n499\n00:23:48.932 --> 00:23:51.762\nyou can start to put in things, right?\n\n500\n00:23:51.762 --> 00:23:56.220\nWhat are some of the things that\nyou normally see in a bulk mailing?\n\n501\n00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.690\nThe word unsubscribe.\n\n502\n00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:00.210\nRight?\n\n503\n00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.180\nAnd you can do regular expressions here.\n\n504\n00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.400\nSo if you wanna like search for\na different case and all that stuff,\n\n505\n00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.980\nit'll accept regular expressions.\n\n506\n00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.380\nBut I'm just gonna put in like,\nunsubscribe.\n\n507\n00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:16.510\nOther things like if you are having\ntrouble viewing this email, right?\n\n508\n00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.960\nBulk mailings always have that link, if\nthere's an HTML email and it's not right,\n\n509\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.170\nyou can click on the link and\nit will take you to their site.\n\n510\n00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.610\nIf I send you a personal\nemail am I gonna write that?\n\n511\n00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:26.907\nNo.\nI mean these are things that you\n\n512\n00:24:26.907 --> 00:24:27.470\ncan look for.\n\n513\n00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.496\nSo I'm just looking for those key words\nand then I can say what I'm gonna do, so\n\n514\n00:24:31.496 --> 00:24:35.768\nI'm gonna do the following and if you look\nat the options we've got a pen disclaimer\n\n515\n00:24:35.768 --> 00:24:38.350\nforward the message well\nthe one I wants not here.\n\n516\n00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:42.672\nI gotta hit more options and in more\noptions I can look in here and we can find\n\n517\n00:24:42.672 --> 00:24:47.275\nthat we can start to mess with the email\nwe can modify the message properties and\n\n518\n00:24:47.275 --> 00:24:50.270\nyou'll see things like\nremoving the header.\n\n519\n00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.780\nSetting the spam confidence level,\nthat's not even what I want.\n\n520\n00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.460\nLet's see, here.\n\n521\n00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:59.370\nPrepend the subject of the message\nwith something and that's what I want.\n\n522\n00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.090\nAnd I'm just gonna add the word bulk\n\n523\n00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.550\nin brackets at the beginning\nof that subject line.\n\n524\n00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.870\nSo now, when the email comes in right\nat the beginning of the subject line,\n\n525\n00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.820\nit will have the word\nbulk in square brackets.\n\n526\n00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.980\nThe users will see that and they'll\nrecognize it; they'll spot that and\n\n527\n00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.110\nthey'll say,\noh okay this is probably a bulk mailer.\n\n528\n00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.010\nAnd it helps them to quickly\ndisseminate whether or\n\n529\n00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:20.120\nnot that's email that's intended for them.\n\n530\n00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.900\nSo I can append that.\n\n531\n00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.570\nYou might have, a rating system.\n\n532\n00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:28.320\nYou have top secret, secret,\nclassified, unclassified.\n\n533\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.090\nAnd so you might look for\ncertain key words and\n\n534\n00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.990\nthen stick in the subject\nline this is classified or\n\n535\n00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.130\nunclassified so people can recognize\nwhat the classification level could be.\n\n536\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.060\nThere's all sorts of different\nthings that you can do in here.\n\n537\n00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.510\nAll right.\n\n538\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.390\nSo, I'll punch that in, and\nI'll go ahead and save it.\n\n539\n00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:45.670\nAnd so now if somebody has those things\nin their email that transport will\n\n540\n00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:46.310\nget flagged.\n\n541\n00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.930\nRight?\nAnd I could go and, whoops.\n\n542\n00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.010\nWhere's my here.\n\n543\n00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.079\nI could go and craft a new email to Jane.\n\n544\n00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:56.040\nAnd my email,\n\n545\n00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.850\nI know it's not gonna get flagged to\nspam because I've got a white list.\n\n546\n00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:03.470\nBut maybe I'm gonna use some of those\nkeywords that get it triggered as spam.\n\n547\n00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.070\nSo like this is a sample bulk message\n\n548\n00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.050\nand I can say,\nbuy my product, it's awesome!\n\n549\n00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:21.580\nAnd then something like the whole\nunsubscribe here, or what was it?\n\n550\n00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.640\nIf you are having trouble viewing\nthis email, whatever it is,\n\n551\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:32.480\nyou specify those phrases in here so\nthat people can spot it.\n\n552\n00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.140\nRight?\nAnd it's gonna look for that content and\n\n553\n00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.780\nrecognize that this is bulk mail and\nthen it's gonna take action on it.\n\n554\n00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.080\nAll right.\nIt'll take that action and\n\n555\n00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.930\nhopefully add that word\nbulk to the beginning.\n\n556\n00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.840\nAll right.\nSo those are a couple of examples.\n\n557\n00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.020\nLet's see,\nI got a little bit of time left.\n\n558\n00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.440\nThere's really just two more I wanna\npoint out that might turn up on the exam.\n\n559\n00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.700\nOne option is, what if we get email and\nit's for a user that we manage.\n\n560\n00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.830\nIt's our own employee,\nwe wanna kinda meter their email.\n\n561\n00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.790\nYou gotta couple of neat things\nthat you can do in these rules.\n\n562\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.900\nWhen you look at the actions\nthere's two that I wanna point out.\n\n563\n00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.790\nUnder Actions,\nwe've got to redirect the message, okay?\n\n564\n00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.260\nYou can actually take a message\nthat's destined for one person and\n\n565\n00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.830\nredirect it somewhere else.\n\n566\n00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.640\nSo if you've terminated an employee,\nand you've disabled their account,\n\n567\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.180\nyou can redirect their email to another\nemployee to take care of that, right?\n\n568\n00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.800\nSo that's one thing that you could do.\n\n569\n00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.590\nYou can also redirect it to make\nsure that it gets moderated.\n\n570\n00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.980\nSee this forward the message for approval?\n\n571\n00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.628\nYou can forward the message to\na particular person or a manager, and\n\n572\n00:27:31.628 --> 00:27:35.470\nin Outlook or in OWA, they'll have\na message, allow the email or not?\n\n573\n00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.854\nAnd if they allow it, then it'll go to\nthe recipient, if they don't allow it,\n\n574\n00:27:38.854 --> 00:27:39.990\nit gets rejected.\n\n575\n00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.680\nSo now you can moderate somebody's email.\n\n576\n00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.750\nYou might have employees that you don't\nwant, or maybe you have a child right,\n\n577\n00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:48.470\nand they're not of the legal age and\nso you don't want them\n\n578\n00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.270\ngetting external emails that\nhaven't been filtered and approved.\n\n579\n00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.230\nYou can do it right here.\n\n580\n00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:56.950\nSo those are some other actions that\nare kinda neat that take action and\n\n581\n00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:00.000\njust allow you to do\na lot of different stuff.\n\n582\n00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.448\nAll right, well I fired off\na couple of emails this episode,\n\n583\n00:28:02.448 --> 00:28:05.430\nlet's jump over to Jane's mailbox and\nsee what they look like on her end.\n\n584\n00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.376\nNow I've got Jane's mailbox pulled\nup back here in the background and\n\n585\n00:28:10.376 --> 00:28:13.260\nright off the bat I can see here's\nthat message about my product.\n\n586\n00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.420\nI said buy my product,\nunsubscribe here and\n\n587\n00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.550\nyou can see that subject line has\nthe word bulk appended to it right there.\n\n588\n00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.680\nI could've also bumped\nthe spam confidence level too.\n\n589\n00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.170\nYou can take more than one action,\n\n590\n00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.400\nand that would have really\ncranked that one up.\n\n591\n00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.340\nHere's my legal disclaimer test,\nand sure enough,\n\n592\n00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.390\nthat legal disclaimer is right there at\nthe end, tacked on at the end to let her\n\n593\n00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.510\nknow that this is a private email\nthat shouldn't be read or whatever.\n\n594\n00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.030\nAll right.\n\n595\n00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.800\nThat's what these\ntransport rules are doing.\n\n596\n00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.350\nAnd it's all applying on the server.\n\n597\n00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:44.040\nSo it doesn't matter whether\nyou connect with Outlook or\n\n598\n00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:49.020\nsome email client on Android, iOS web,\nWindows Mobile, whatever, doesn't matter.\n\n599\n00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.540\nIt's the server that's doing this.\n\n600\n00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.160\nAnd all the email is passing\nthrough the server and so\n\n601\n00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.340\nall the emails have these rules applied.\n\n602\n00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.370\nSo transport rules, are a real\npowerful function found inside of\n\n603\n00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.120\nMicrosoft Exchange and it's definitely\none of the neater things to work with.\n\n604\n00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.530\nAll right, well, that's about all\nI've got on Transport Rules, so\n\n605\n00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.200\nthis is a pretty good spot for us to wrap\nthis one up In this episode we gotta\n\n606\n00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.610\nchoose to see what transport rules were\nand what they were made up of right?\n\n607\n00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.550\nRemember we've got the condition,\nthe action and the exceptions right?\n\n608\n00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.680\nSo we saw how to build those and we

00:00:15.597\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.597 --> 00:00:17.118\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:20.937\nBack again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:24.570\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at message ques.\n\n7\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.110\nNow message ques, by and large,\n\n8\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.050\nare something that just runs in the\nbackground that we don't even think about.\n\n9\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.800\nWhen email comes in to our\norganization it makes its way over to,\n\n10\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.760\nwell usually, to our client access server.\n\n11\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.111\nThat's our receive connector\nwhere SMTP is running and\n\n12\n00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:43.331\nwhere our front-end transport\nservice is running.\n\n13\n00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:45.605\nBut think about front-end\ntransport services,\n\n14\n00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:48.904\nit doesn't handle mail very long,\nit receives it and moves it along, so\n\n15\n00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:52.223\nthe front-end transport service\ndoesn't actually have a true queue.\n\n16\n00:00:52.223 --> 00:00:53.816\nThe email goes in the memory and\n\n17\n00:00:53.816 --> 00:00:57.622\nthen moves right on out the server\nagain it doesn't stay there very long.\n\n18\n00:00:57.622 --> 00:01:02.515\nThen it sends it to a mailbox server and\non the mailbox server that's where you\n\n19\n00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:08.181\nhave the hub transport service, which then\nconnects to the mailbox transport service.\n\n20\n00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:11.410\nThe hub transport service\ndoes have queues.\n\n21\n00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.290\nIt receives emails, and\nit writes them to the hard drive.\n\n22\n00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.460\nIt actually maintains queue folders\nright there on the hard drive, and\n\n23\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.980\nit puts the emails there\nwhile it sorts them out.\n\n24\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.700\nThe hub transport server\ndoes a lot of things.\n\n25\n00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.870\nIt has to figure out where\nthe email needs to go.\n\n26\n00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.260\nIt needs to apply any transport\nrules if its got any.\n\n27\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.430\nIt's gotta do malware scanning.\n\n28\n00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.310\nAll the various things that happen\nin the hub transport service.\n\n29\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.500\nThen when it knows where it's going,\n\n30\n00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.920\nit sends that email either to\nanother hub transport service\n\n31\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.610\non a server somewhere else if its gotta\ndifferent destination, or it sends it\n\n32\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.890\nto the mailbox transport service where the\nemail's finally deposited in the mailbox.\n\n33\n00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.960\nThe mailbox transport service\nalso doesn't have queues.\n\n34\n00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.140\nIt receives an email, stores it in memory,\nwrites it to the mailbox database, and\n\n35\n00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.300\nthen it's gone.\n\n36\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.600\nSo the only place we actually have\nqueues are in the hub transfer service.\n\n37\n00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.510\nAnd the hub transfer service runs on\nall of our mailbox servers, and so\n\n38\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.710\nthey've got message queues there.\n\n39\n00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.740\nNow, we don't normally care about them.\n\n40\n00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.280\nAnd the reason is emails come in,\nthey then get processed,\n\n41\n00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.970\nthen they get written to the mailbox\ndatabase, and then they're gone.\n\n42\n00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.060\nThe emails remain in the database, and\n\n43\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.550\nthey remain in our transaction log files\nfor the database, so they stay there.\n\n44\n00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.720\nSo we never really need the queues.\n\n45\n00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.500\nSo if we don't really need them,\nwhy do I bring them up?\n\n46\n00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.180\nWell, you don't need queues\nwhen things are running right.\n\n47\n00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.300\nWhen things are running the way they're\nsupposed to be you don't need queues.\n\n48\n00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.870\nEmail flows right through the system and\nyour queues stay empty.\n\n49\n00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.590\nBut if something is wrong, if something\nis wrong your ques start to grow.\n\n50\n00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.790\nEmail just starts backing up and your\nques get bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n51\n00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.580\nSo ques are something you wanna keep an\neye on because as they get bigger that's\n\n52\n00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.160\ngonna indicate a problem.\n\n53\n00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.797\nAnd the problem could be your problem,\nit could be somebody elses problem, but\n\n54\n00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:54.038\nit's the ques that'll\nhelp you identify that.\n\n55\n00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:56.779\nWell, first off, how do we see the queues?\n\n56\n00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.170\nWell, if you're in the exchange admin\ncenter, the short answer is you can't.\n\n57\n00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.390\nThere's no really good way to view\nthe queues in the admin center.\n\n58\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.050\nI know the queues are there.\n\n59\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.990\nWhen I go to my servers, I know my\nmailbox servers do have these queues.\n\n60\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.150\nI know they're there,\nbut I can't see them.\n\n61\n00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.820\nThey don't give me a tool\nto be able to do that.\n\n62\n00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.790\nThe only way to view the queues,\nwell, I guess there's two ways.\n\n63\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.040\nYou could drop and PowerShell.\n\n64\n00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.596\nIn the PowerShell,\nyou've got the Get-Queue command.\n\n65\n00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:24.560\nOr Get-Queue, that cmdlet and\n\n66\n00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.160\nyou can run that and you can pull\nyour queues and see what's in them.\n\n67\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.030\nBut there is a graphical utility for\n\n68\n00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.980\nit, it's just not in\nthe exchange admin center.\n\n69\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.690\nSo if you're on your own client there's\nnot a really good way to see it.\n\n70\n00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.270\nBut if you jump over to any\nof your exchange servers\n\n71\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.030\non your exchange server you'll have\na tool called the exchange tool box.\n\n72\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.670\nAnd the exchange tool box, it's\ninstalled automatically with exchange.\n\n73\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.700\nI didn't have to choose to install that.\n\n74\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.800\nAnd when you run it, it gives you access\nto a few really interesting things.\n\n75\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.200\nSo when it get's connected, you'll see\nthat you have the ability to view your\n\n76\n00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.700\nqueues, as well as to do some\nother troubleshooting things.\n\n77\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.120\nSo, it's pretty neat.\n\n78\n00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.190\nThe queues are what I'm concerned\nabout though and so if I look,\n\n79\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.410\nI've got my Queue Viewer right here.\n\n80\n00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.520\nAnd if I run that,\nit's gonna open up those queues.\n\n81\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.350\nNow, on a busy server,\nit can take a moment for this to load and\n\n82\n00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.770\nit's asking for me to pick a hub transport\nserver and so I'll browse and pick one.\n\n83\n00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.680\nAnd, well,\neventually it'll let me pick one.\n\n84\n00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.200\nSo [LAUGH] I ran this on\nmy client access server, so\n\n85\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.260\nit's making me connect\nto my mailbox server.\n\n86\n00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.620\nIf I'd connected on a mailbox server,\nit would have been faster.\n\n87\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.620\nRemember the hub transport service,\nand the mailbox transport service,\n\n88\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.150\nthey run on the mailbox servers,\nonly the front-end transport service\n\n89\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.220\nruns on the client access box, so\nthat's why I had to pick that.\n\n90\n00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.260\nI'll set that as my default, so\nI don't have to do it again, but\n\n91\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.300\nit's gonna connect and it's gonna\nshow me the queues on that system.\n\n92\n00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.610\nNow, I expect to see two queues.\n\n93\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.420\nNow, there could be three,\nthere could be 100.\n\n94\n00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.040\nBut I always expect to see,\nusually, two or three.\n\n95\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.330\nAnd when we look in here, I'll see I've\nactually got those two or three right now.\n\n96\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.310\nSo the submission queue.\n\n97\n00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.330\nYou're always going to\nhave the submission queue.\n\n98\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.020\nNo matter what, that's the one\nthat you're always going to see.\n\n99\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.740\nIf I'm submitting an email, if an email\nis coming in, or an email is going out.\n\n100\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.460\nThe hub transport service receives it and\n\n101\n00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.520\nimmediately sticks it in\nthe submission queue.\n\n102\n00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.230\nSubmission means it hasn't\nbeen processed yet.\n\n103\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.680\nIt hasn't had the transport rules applied.\n\n104\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.200\nIt hasn't found its destination.\n\n105\n00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.550\nIt doesn't know where it's going yet.\n\n106\n00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.730\nSo it goes there.\n\n107\n00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.895\nThen, the server's gonna look at it and\nfigure out what to do with it.\n\n108\n00:05:26.895 --> 00:05:32.245\nIf it's an internal email, you're gonna\nget an SMTP delivery to mailbox queue.\n\n109\n00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:33.375\nLike this.\n\n110\n00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.435\nSo you'll see these mailbox queues appear.\n\n111\n00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:36.943\nAnd that's another one\nthat I expect to see.\n\n112\n00:05:36.943 --> 00:05:40.095\nYou're usually gonna have emails moving\nthrough your system at a pretty regular\n\n113\n00:05:40.095 --> 00:05:42.515\nrate, so you can expect to\nsee that mailbox queue there.\n\n114\n00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.590\nAnd then you might have a third\none which is your error queue.\n\n115\n00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.320\nIf there's emails that\ncome through corrupted,\n\n116\n00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.810\nthat are damaged,\nthey'll go into this error queue.\n\n117\n00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:51.370\nI don't have it.\n\n118\n00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.180\nThat means I don't have any corrupted\nemail but you might see that one appear.\n\n119\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.300\nThose are three queues\nthat can be long standing.\n\n120\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.910\nThey can stay there and be there for\ndays, weeks, months, years, whatever.\n\n121\n00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.480\nThey'll be there.\n\n122\n00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:06.440\nBut there's hundred,\nliterally hundreds, maybe thousands of\n\n123\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.490\nother queues that might appear that\nare transient, they come and go.\n\n124\n00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.590\nWhen I get an email, and it's an outbound\nemail, I'm sending it out, I need to send\n\n125\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.820\nemail to somebody at gmail.com, somebody\nat yahoo.com, somebody at microsoft.com.\n\n126\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.270\nWell, we create a queue for\neach of those domains.\n\n127\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.754\nYour mail server does an MX record lookup.\n\n128\n00:06:26.754 --> 00:06:29.560\nIt looks DNS from the mail\nexchanger records.\n\n129\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.320\nAnd that mail exchanger tells\nit where to send the email to.\n\n130\n00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.318\nEmails going to somebody at microsoft.com,\ngo to one set of mail servers.\n\n131\n00:06:36.318 --> 00:06:40.660\nAnd somebody at google.com,\nsomebody at Gmail, somebody at Yahoo!\n\n132\n00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.100\nThose all go to different servers.\n\n133\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.660\nAnd it'll create a queue for each one.\n\n134\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.430\nIf the remote server is down then\nmy queue for Gmail, my queue for\n\n135\n00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.450\nMicrosoft or whatever,\nwill sit there and build up.\n\n136\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.480\nAnd email will sit in the queue.\n\n137\n00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.630\nNow the queue's retry.\n\n138\n00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.450\nThey retry the transmit periodically.\n\n139\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.460\nThen it actually works\non a weird interval.\n\n140\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.110\nSo it'll try 3 times, 30 seconds apart.\n\n141\n00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.240\nSo in the first minute and\na half it'll try three times.\n\n142\n00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.810\nIf that fails then it stretches\nit out to a bigger window and\n\n143\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.010\nit tries three times every six hours.\n\n144\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.090\nSo now it's spread out more further.\n\n145\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.050\nThen it tries at a bigger\nwindow over a 72 hour period,\n\n146\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.390\nwell actually, I tried it for\n3 days to send an email.\n\n147\n00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.280\nNow by the time it gets there\nit sends the user a warning\n\n148\n00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.810\nsaying this email has been delayed,\nso you know it's been delayed, but\n\n149\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.250\nit will retry because connectivity to the\nremote server might just be intermittent.\n\n150\n00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.520\nIt might just temporarily failed and\nso it'll queued that message.\n\n151\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.570\nNow it's rare do we\nhave to wait that long.\n\n152\n00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.160\nBecause every time somebody\nsends an email to that domain,\n\n153\n00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.620\nit's gonna retry the queue.\n\n154\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.830\nSo while I say it might be 30 seconds or\n\n155\n00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.900\nthen 6 hours, it usually happens\nfar more in advance of that.\n\n156\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.072\nBut if you see a queue for an external\ndomain and it's sitting there getting\n\n157\n00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:53.509\nbigger, well, it just usually means that,\nthat remote site is not connected.\n\n158\n00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:56.773\nBut if you see all of your queues\ngetting bigger and bigger and\n\n159\n00:07:56.773 --> 00:07:59.918\nbigger That's an indication\nthat you've got a problem.\n\n160\n00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:03.190\nMaybe your internet connection has failed.\n\n161\n00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.918\nMaybe your system has been\nadded to an email blacklist,\n\n162\n00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:09.240\none of those spam blacklists and\nso everybody is rejecting you now.\n\n163\n00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.074\nThose are all cases where your queue\nis going to get bigger and bigger.\n\n164\n00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:14.476\nSo that does happen all the time.\n\n165\n00:08:14.476 --> 00:08:17.810\nAll right, let me show you\nan example of how the queues work.\n\n166\n00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.560\nI want to get an email stuck in my queues.\n\n167\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.320\nBut the problem is, it's kind of hard\nto get an email stuck in the queue.\n\n168\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.130\nThey move through pretty quickly.\n\n169\n00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.338\nSo, what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna simulate a database failure.\n\n170\n00:08:28.338 --> 00:08:33.510\nSo, I'm gonna jump back into my EAC, and\nI'll go to my servers, and my databases.\n\n171\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.925\nAnd I'm gonna take my mailbox database,\nand I'm just going to dismount it.\n\n172\n00:08:36.925 --> 00:08:40.050\nSo, your database is mounted\npretty much all the time.\n\n173\n00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.770\nIf you dismount it, it takes it offline.\n\n174\n00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.230\nWhen your database is offline,\nyou don't lose email.\n\n175\n00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.660\nNew email can come in,\nit just gets stuck in the queue.\n\n176\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.050\nIt stays in the queue until\nthe database becomes available again.\n\n177\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.630\nSo I just dismounted that and now I'm\ngonna send an email into the system.\n\n178\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.680\nNow if I were to fire up Outlook or\nOutlook web app or whatever\n\n179\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.070\nthey're not gonna be able to get into\nmy mailbox to be able to send an email.\n\n180\n00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.890\nSo I just can't even get connected\nif my mailbox isn't available.\n\n181\n00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.460\nSo, there's a neat way that\nwe can generate email that's\n\n182\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.930\nreally useful for testing.\n\n183\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.060\nIf you're troubleshooting a mail server,\nit's really a neat thing that you can do\n\n184\n00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.910\nwhere you can use TelNet to connect\ndirectly to an SMTP server and\n\n185\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.145\ninject email into it.\n\n186\n00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:25.030\nAnd it's useful, because you can\nsimulate different scenarios,\n\n187\n00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.030\nemails destined for\ndifferent places and things like that.\n\n188\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.390\nSo that's what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna open up a command prompt.\n\n189\n00:09:31.535 --> 00:09:36.110\nAnd Telnet is actually not installed\nby default in Windows, so if\n\n190\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.300\nyou're gonna use it you need to make sure\nyou add it, and it's easy enough to add.\n\n191\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.050\nYou just go into your Server Manager, and\n\n192\n00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.990\nin Server Manager you can go up to Manage,\nand Add Roles and Features.\n\n193\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.540\nAnd the Telnet client is just\na feature you add that feature in.\n\n194\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.770\nSo I've already got\nthat here on my system.\n\n195\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.070\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nuse Telnet to connect in and\n\n196\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.780\ngenerate an email to a user in my system.\n\n197\n00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.680\nNow if you want to do that,\n\n198\n00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.340\nthe first thing you need to do is you\nneed to say Telnet and then your server.\n\n199\n00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.000\nWell, I'm on my client access server, so\n\n200\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.440\nI'm just gonna connect to 127.0.0.1,\nmy sever.\n\n201\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.120\nBut if I was on a workstation,\nI would specify the server name.\n\n202\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.160\nSo Lab-CAS01.itprotv.net, or\nwhatever the name of your server is.\n\n203\n00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.530\nAnd then if I stop right there,\nit's gonna telnet on port 23.\n\n204\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.560\nI need to add a 25 to the end so\nit knows that I wanna telnet on port 25,\n\n205\n00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.180\nI wanna simulate SMTP traffic.\n\n206\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.870\nSo I'm gonna run that and\nI've now connected to the mail server.\n\n207\n00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.830\nNow I can talk to the mail server but\nI have to talk to it using it's language.\n\n208\n00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.860\nAnd that's a little bit weird but\nit's what I need to do.\n\n209\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.740\nSo you start off by saying helo,\nwhich is H-E-L-O, only one L.\n\n210\n00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.510\nAnd specify the name of you workstation.\n\n211\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.730\nSo maybe I'm on like dplaptop.itprotv.net\nor something like that.\n\n212\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.920\nSo you say who you are.\n\n213\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.110\nThen, you say who\nthe email is coming from.\n\n214\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.810\nSo I'm gonna say mail from and\nthen who it's from.\n\n215\n00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.950\nAnd I'm gonna say this one is from me,\n\n216\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.300\nso Don Pezet and then I'll put\nmy actual email here at the end.\n\n217\n00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.820\nSo maybe I'm dpezet@itprotv.net,\nor something like that, right?\n\n218\n00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.950\nSo this is an internal email coming in.\n\n219\n00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:17.050\nThen, I have to say who it's to,\nand I'm gonna say RCPT TO.\n\n220\n00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.690\nWe're indicating the recipient\nthat this is destined for.\n\n221\n00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.110\nOh actually, it's warning me there\nabout my invalid address cuz I provided\n\n222\n00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.640\nan internal address.\n\n223\n00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.560\nAnd so I need to correct that.\n\n224\n00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.040\nNow here's where things\nget a little challenging.\n\n225\n00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.800\nNormally it's a server\nconnecting this way, not us.\n\n226\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.350\nDoes a server make mistakes?\n\n227\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.870\nNo.\n\n228\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.150\nSo a server always gets it right.\n\n229\n00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.240\nIf you make a typo or you type an address\nthat's not valid or something like that\n\n230\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.430\nand you get a warning, well, then you\nkinda have to start all over again.\n\n231\n00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.560\nYou have to exit out of the session and\nkinda get back in there a second time.\n\n232\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.560\nAnd it can be a little\nchallenging to get out.\n\n233\n00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.280\nLike quit is technically the key word to\nget out and eventually it'll exit, but\n\n234\n00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.476\na lot of times it's just easier to [LAUGH]\nclose the window and start over again.\n\n235\n00:11:57.476 --> 00:12:00.847\nSo that's what I'll do and this time\nI'll just use like an external address.\n\n236\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.920\nAll right, so I'm gonna connect\nto that internal host on port 25.\n\n237\n00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.090\nI'll say, helo.\n\n238\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.990\nAnd if you leave your workstation name\noff, some servers will allow you to do\n\n239\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.610\nthat, and just see how it\njust kinda resolved the name?\n\n240\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.330\nSo I'll do that.\n\n241\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:18.610\nAnd then I'm gonna say mail from and\nthis time I'll just specify my external\n\n242\n00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:24.280\naddress, so I'll say this mail\nis coming from don@ITPro.tv.\n\n243\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.540\nAnd then I'll say who it's to.\n\n244\n00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.070\nAnd I'm going to do an email to,\nI'll do Jane Smith here, so\n\n245\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.220\nI'll say JSmith@itprotv.net.\n\n246\n00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.420\nSo she's a user here, so\nI get recipient and sender okay.\n\n247\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.290\nThen I need to give it the data for\nthe email, so I'll say data and the very\n\n248\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.580\nfirst line I need to say subject colon\nfollowed by what I want the subject to be.\n\n249\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.580\nSo I'll say this is a test\nemail from outside.\n\n250\n00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.790\nOops, which I spelled wrong.\n\n251\n00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.730\nI spelled it wrong, and\nunfortunately I can't use backspace.\n\n252\n00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.860\nThose keys have already\nbeen sent to the server, so\n\n253\n00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.280\nI'll just have to accept\nthat I can't spell.\n\n254\n00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.100\nThen after that we start to provide\nour actual email message and so\n\n255\n00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.920\nI'll just say this is a test email.\n\n256\n00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.020\nI hope you get it.\n\n257\n00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.090\nI put a lot of effort into it.\n\n258\n00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.530\nSo you just type your email.\n\n259\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.830\nAnd then when you're done with the email,\nnotice this little message here.\n\n260\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.600\nPress enter, a period, and enter.\n\n261\n00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.860\nSo I'll press enter, a period and enter.\n\n262\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.760\nAnd that's how it knows the email is done,\nand so it's been flagged, and\n\n263\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.710\nit'll take it a second, but it's actually\ngenerating the email, there we go.\n\n264\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.062\nAnd see how it says queued mail for\ndelivery.\n\n265\n00:13:30.062 --> 00:13:32.384\nIt's queued it and it's ready to go.\n\n266\n00:13:32.384 --> 00:13:35.506\nAnd from here I can quit, some servers\nwill automatically kick you out,\n\n267\n00:13:35.506 --> 00:13:39.000\nI'm gonna quit by typing quit and now I've\ngot an email that went into the queue.\n\n268\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.850\nI know the email went into the queue and\n\n269\n00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.170\nby doing it this way, I just took\nmy mail client out of the equation.\n\n270\n00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:49.430\nSo if you're troubleshooting Outlook or\nThunderbird, or some other mail client.\n\n271\n00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.860\nDoing it this way says,\nwhat if I don't use the client?\n\n272\n00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.490\nWhat if I just do it by hand?\n\n273\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.680\nDo I get to that SMTP server?\n\n274\n00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.180\nMaybe I can't even connect to\nthe SMTP server in the first place.\n\n275\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.060\nAnd you'd see that right here.\n\n276\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.860\nBut it's connected.\n\n277\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.180\nNow, that's going to go into the queue.\n\n278\n00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.040\nIt went into the front end\ntransport service first, right?\n\n279\n00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.343\nCuz I connected to my\nclient access server.\n\n280\n00:14:09.343 --> 00:14:12.907\nIt then sends it to the transport\nservice back on the mailbox server.\n\n281\n00:14:12.907 --> 00:14:16.623\nNow it went to the mailbox server\nthat hosted Jane Smith's email, so\n\n282\n00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:17.527\nit went to hers.\n\n283\n00:14:17.527 --> 00:14:21.070\nAnd it went into that queue and that queue\nsays okay well I know where it needs to\n\n284\n00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.741\ngo, it needs to go to a mailbox\ndatabase on the inside and so\n\n285\n00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:25.121\nit moved it to mailbox queue.\n\n286\n00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:28.881\nAnd then It tries to go to the mailbox\ndatabase, but it's offline.\n\n287\n00:14:28.881 --> 00:14:31.400\nSo that email should now\nbe stuck in a queue.\n\n288\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.570\nAnd if I jump back to my\nqueue viewer right here,\n\n289\n00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:41.940\nI do see that I've got a mailbox database\nqueue and it's got two emails stuck in it.\n\n290\n00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.460\nNow I only drafted one email,\nwhat's this other one?\n\n291\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.971\nWell, there's a lot of status messages and\nother emails that are getting generated in\n\n292\n00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:50.728\nthe background that go to system accounts,\nand we never see those.\n\n293\n00:14:50.728 --> 00:14:52.720\nSo some of these might be that, but\n\n294\n00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.824\none of them is probably\nthe email that I just drafted.\n\n295\n00:14:55.824 --> 00:15:00.145\nAnd so I can take that queue, and with\nany of these queues, if you kinda look at\n\n296\n00:15:00.145 --> 00:15:04.271\nthem, they usually have like\na pseudo-random number attached to them so\n\n297\n00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:07.288\nwe don't get duplicate\nqueue names across servers.\n\n298\n00:15:07.288 --> 00:15:11.450\nBut I can see this is SMTP delivery to\na mailbox and it's in a retry state.\n\n299\n00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.310\nIt's already tried to\ndeliver the mail once and\n\n300\n00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.940\nit failed,\nnow it's waiting to retry again.\n\n301\n00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.260\nAnd it will try every 30 seconds for\nthree times and\n\n302\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.250\nthen it will go to\na bigger window of time.\n\n303\n00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.890\nAnd if you don't wanna wait you\ncan come in and force it to retry.\n\n304\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.890\nWhen you right click,\nsee how you've got retry?\n\n305\n00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.448\nSo I can tell her go ahead and\nretry again.\n\n306\n00:15:28.448 --> 00:15:32.779\nOr if that server's just not coming\nback up I can say go ahead and\n\n307\n00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:35.089\nremove the messages with an NDR.\n\n308\n00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:38.382\nIn other words, cancel the messages and\nsend a non-delivery report\n\n309\n00:15:38.382 --> 00:15:41.580\nback to whoever it was who sent\nus the email in the first place.\n\n310\n00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.460\nSo it can do that.\n\n311\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.175\nOr we can remove the messages\nwithout sending an NDR.\n\n312\n00:15:46.175 --> 00:15:49.716\nJust delete them and that's it, now nobody\nknows what happened in the email right?\n\n313\n00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:51.074\nBut normally you wanna try and retry.\n\n314\n00:15:51.074 --> 00:15:56.098\nNow if we know there's a problem you can\nsuspend the queue and now the queue goes\n\n315\n00:15:56.098 --> 00:16:01.676\ninto suspension state It's not retrying,\nbut it is continuing to accumulate email.\n\n316\n00:16:01.676 --> 00:16:03.382\nSo even though the database is offline,\n\n317\n00:16:03.382 --> 00:16:06.670\nI'm not losing email it's\njust pooling up right here.\n\n318\n00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.920\nNow I said that one of these\nemails is probably my email.\n\n319\n00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.250\nWouldn't it be nice if we could\ntell whether it was or not?\n\n320\n00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.280\nWell you can.\n\n321\n00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.250\nIf you double click on the queue\nit'll show you what's inside it.\n\n322\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.990\nAnd so I can see here's\nan email from don@itpro.tv.\n\n323\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.380\nRight?\nThat's that email that I\n\n324\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.750\ndrafted a moment ago.\n\n325\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.910\nAnd I can see there's another email\nfrom health mailbox blah blah blah.\n\n326\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.590\nThat's one of those system accounts.\n\n327\n00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.480\nRight?\nAnd it's doing just a health check.\n\n328\n00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.970\nIt's actually monitoring whether\nthe databases are up itself, and\n\n329\n00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.030\nthis is how it knows\nthe database is offline.\n\n330\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.204\nSo it sends these every couple of seconds.\n\n331\n00:16:38.204 --> 00:16:41.783\nBut as I look over I can see some\ninformation about where it came from,\n\n332\n00:16:41.783 --> 00:16:42.967\nwhere it's going to.\n\n333\n00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:47.331\nAnd I can even see the subject line here,\nThis is a test email from outside.\n\n334\n00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:50.690\nAnd if there was an error,\nI can see the error message.\n\n335\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.336\nSo looking at this other one,\nit's been in the queue longer, so\n\n336\n00:16:53.336 --> 00:16:56.976\nit's got a nice big message that's telling\nme here, the mailbox database is offline.\n\n337\n00:16:56.976 --> 00:16:58.520\nI can see what the problem is.\n\n338\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.160\nThat's the really cool part about\nthese queues is you can see the error.\n\n339\n00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.050\nIf I'm getting rejected on the other\nside because I'm blacklisted,\n\n340\n00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.640\nthe error will say that.\n\n341\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.980\nIf I can't reach the other side,\n\n342\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.810\nif the DNS lookup fails,\nthe error message will say that.\n\n343\n00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.350\nI can see why it's failing,\nand that's pretty neat.\n\n344\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.350\nAnd if you double click on it,\n\n345\n00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:19.120\nyou can actually get the header of\nthat message, and we can see it now.\n\n346\n00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.410\nNotice how it doesn't\nshow the messages body?\n\n347\n00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.470\nThe Queue Viewer is designed for\nadministrators to troubleshoot,\n\n348\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.150\nit's not designed for\nus to eavesdrop on people's email.\n\n349\n00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.770\nSo, it doesn't give you the ability\nto see the message body.\n\n350\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.450\nBut, you do see the subject line, and\nthen you can see the header of it.\n\n351\n00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.860\nAnd that header is useful cuz we can use\nthis for troubleshooting things, right?\n\n352\n00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.580\nThe header contains a lot\nof good information.\n\n353\n00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.580\nNow the problem with the header,\n\n354\n00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.900\nthough, is that it can sometimes\nbe really complex, right?\n\n355\n00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.160\nThere is a lot of stuff in here, and\nthis is actually a small header.\n\n356\n00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.180\nLet me show you,\nI copied a header before the show.\n\n357\n00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.520\nHere's a header from an email\nthat I received yesterday.\n\n358\n00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.660\nSo when we look at this,\nthere's a lot of stuff.\n\n359\n00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.010\nWe've got more than one\nReceived From message.\n\n360\n00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.710\nHow did I receive an email\nfrom three different servers?\n\n361\n00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.790\nWell it means it passed through three\ndifferent servers before getting to me.\n\n362\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:07.810\nAnd I can see who it's from, and\nwho it's to, and all this other data.\n\n363\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.190\nWhat is all this stuff?\n\n364\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.020\nWell, if you memorize it,\nyou learn each of these, then you know and\n\n365\n00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.220\nyou can read these headers pretty easy.\n\n366\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.085\nBut if you can't what you can do\nis you can just copy this, and\n\n367\n00:18:18.085 --> 00:18:21.990\nif I go back to my Exchange Toolbox,\nhere's where I went to the Queue Viewer,\n\n368\n00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.780\nright above it is\nthe Remote Connectivity Analyzer.\n\n369\n00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.490\nNow the Remote Connectivity Analyzer is\nnot a tool that runs right here on our\n\n370\n00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.140\nmachine, it's just a web page.\n\n371\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.430\nAnd so you can bypass this entirely and\ngo to the web page.\n\n372\n00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:39.360\nBut if you fire it up, it's Microsoft's\nweb site testconnectivity.microsoft.com.\n\n373\n00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.240\nSo easy to remember.\n\n374\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.028\nSo on any workstation you go to\ntestconnectivity.microsoft.com, and\n\n375\n00:18:44.028 --> 00:18:46.880\nyou get all sorts of email\ntests that you can run.\n\n376\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.320\nIt'll test whether Exchange ActiveSync\nis working on your server,\n\n377\n00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.020\nwhether Exchange Web Services are working,\nwhether Outlook can connect.\n\n378\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.850\nIt's gonna test each one of these.\n\n379\n00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.550\nYou can test your SMTP server, right?\n\n380\n00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:03.600\nI can do an inbound SMTP email test,\nthen way down here at the bottom,\n\n381\n00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.720\nit's kind of off my screen,\nlet me resize this window, here we go.\n\n382\n00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.950\nWay down here at the bottom,\nI got a nice little Next button, and\n\n383\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.770\nwe can start to move through that and then\nyou specify who you're trying to email,\n\n384\n00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.250\nand it will generate\nan email from Microsoft and\n\n385\n00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.850\nsend it to your SMTP server and\nyou can see if you got it.\n\n386\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:17.820\nDid you get that email?\n\n387\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.720\nSo kind of cool that you can run\nthese tests right from their site.\n\n388\n00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.440\nYou can do POP and IMAP tests also.\n\n389\n00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.240\nWith those, on the next screen,\nit actually asks you for\n\n390\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.420\nsome user account information.\n\n391\n00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.860\nSo you need a sample user.\n\n392\n00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.130\nAnd it'll login as your user,\ngenerate an e-mail, and\n\n393\n00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.030\nthen it'll tell you right here on\nthe page whether or not it succeeded.\n\n394\n00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.400\nBut one of the more useful tools,\n\n395\n00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.880\nif I go back,\nis right over here the Message Analyzer.\n\n396\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.220\nAnd you can take that Message Analyzer,\nand you can paste your header right here.\n\n397\n00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.720\nSo I'm taking the header from here.\n\n398\n00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.170\nI just copied that, and\nI'm pasting it right in here.\n\n399\n00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.320\nAnd when you hit Analyze Header,\nit's gonna take that header and\n\n400\n00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.380\nturn it into a nice little table\nthat's a heck of a lot easier to read.\n\n401\n00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.520\nSo, remember how I had\nthose three received froms?\n\n402\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.640\nAnd I was like,\nhow do you get an email from all three?\n\n403\n00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.670\nWell, right here it shows Hop 1,\nHop 2, Hop 3.\n\n404\n00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.330\nI had three hops in the path\nof getting the email.\n\n405\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.930\nHere's the servers I went through,\nname and IP.\n\n406\n00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.240\nHere's the delay each server introduced,\nso I can see each of those.\n\n407\n00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.560\nAnd then the message type.\n\n408\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.280\nI can see that it went over TLS,\nit was submitted via MAPI, apparently,\n\n409\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.000\nI can see how that kind\nof processed through.\n\n410\n00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.700\nAnd then after that I get\nmy other headers, and\n\n411\n00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.130\nit breaks them down showing the name\nof the header and what they are.\n\n412\n00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.550\nAnd if I don't know what it is, if I\nlook at one of these and I'm like okay,\n\n413\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:36.920\nwhat is XMS has attach.\n\n414\n00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.010\nWell you can click on it, and\nit'll take you to a page and\n\n415\n00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.850\nit'll tell you what that is so\nyou can interpret it.\n\n416\n00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.320\nSo really kinda handy.\n\n417\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.230\nA neat little tool to have to be\nable to decipher this information.\n\n418\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.180\nSo that's just\ntestconnectivity.microsoft.com.\n\n419\n00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.860\nIt's a website they set up a while back,\nit's been available.\n\n420\n00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.680\nIt has all sort of Office365 tests,\nbut they work on regular Exchange\n\n421\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.040\ntoo because on premises Exchange\nis the same as Office365 Exchange.\n\n422\n00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.640\nThe difference is just what\nservers it's running on.\n\n423\n00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.770\nMicrosoft servers versus yours.\n\n424\n00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.240\nSo you can take advantage of\na lot of these different things.\n\n425\n00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.680\nEven on the client side,\nit's got troubleshooting tools here for\n\n426\n00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.630\nthe end users, so they can run\nthe client connectivity analyzer.\n\n427\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.610\nAnd it'll tell you like, hey you got\na firewall here blocking connectivity or\n\n428\n00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.440\nwhatever, and\nit'll help you identify that.\n\n429\n00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.580\nReally neat stuff,\na great way to troubleshoot.\n\n430\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.080\nAll right, and so as I watch here my\nqueues are starting to build up, right.\n\n431\n00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.980\nI've got some more things appearing.\n\n432\n00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.500\nSo some additional messages\npopping up in that queue.\n\n433\n00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.860\nAnd that's a great way to identify\nthat you've got a problem, right?\n\n434\n00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.010\nIf your queues are growing,\nyou know there's an issue.\n\n435\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.180\nThey shouldn't be getting bigger,\nthey should shrink.\n\n436\n00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.960\nNow, the more traffic your server moves,\nthe bigger these queues might be.\n\n437\n00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.640\nIf you're pushing thousands\nof emails per minute,\n\n438\n00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.620\nthen you should expect to see\n1,000 emails in your queue, right?\n\n439\n00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:54.090\nBut if you push 50 emails a minute, and\n\n440\n00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.550\nyou got 1,000 emails in your queue,\nthen you got a problem.\n\n441\n00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.690\nYou got an issue and you've got to\nmake sure that you jump in there and\n\n442\n00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:00.980\nfind out where that hangup is.\n\n443\n00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.750\nAnd looking at this error\nis a great way to see it.\n\n444\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.310\nSo message queues in Exchange,\nfor the most part we ignore them.\n\n445\n00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.080\nWe don't even think about it,\nit's all automatic in the background.\n\n446\n00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.920\nThe front end transport service and\nthe mailbox transport service don't\n\n447\n00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.140\neven use queues,\nthe hub transport service does though.\n\n448\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.550\nAnd we wanna watch it just as\nan indicator of a problem,\n\n449\n00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.370\nit's a great test to be able to\nsee whether you got any issues.\n\n450\n00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.840\nAnd remember from the PowerShell you can\ndo the Get-Queue command, and so you can\n\n451\n00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.870\nview it from PowerShell too if you want to\nautomate it or create your own reports.\n\n452\n00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.970\nYou can do all sorts of neat stuff.\n\n453\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.055\nAnd there's plenty of third party products\nout there that monitor your queue\n\n454\n00:22:33.055 --> 00:22:34.380\nlinks also, and so\n\n455\n00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.641\nthey can report back and you get just\na wealth of information from there.\n\n456\n00:22:37.641 --> 00:22:39.930\nAll right.\n\n457\n00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.335\nI think that's about all\nI've got on the queues,\n\n458\n00:22:43.335 --> 00:22:46.990\njust be aware that there's a number of\ndifferent errors that can appear there and\n\n459\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.350\nwe just need to keep an eye on it.\n\n460\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.430\nIt's a great troubleshooting utility.\n\n461\n00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.010\nAll right, well this is a great\nplace to wrap this one up.\n\n462\n00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:52.810\nSo in this episode,\n\n463\n00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.490\nwe got a chance to see the email\nqueues inside of Microsoft Exchange.\n\n464\n00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.960\nWe saw how to use the Exchange\ntoolbox to access the queue viewer and\n\n465\n00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.740\nsee those message queues.\n\n466\n00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.160\nAnd we got to take a look at\nMicrosoft's test connectivity website,\n\n467\n00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.570\nwhere we can evaluate our system, our\nconnectivity, whether things are working.\n\n468\n00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.200\nAnd we can see it from Microsoft's\nperspective, which is useful for testing\n\n469\n00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.780\nas well as deciphering those email message\nheaders to see information about them,\n\n470\n00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.380\nwhere they come from, where they're\ngoing to and all that other information.\n\n471\n00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.520\nSo, just some great resources\nright there available for you.\n\n472\n00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.830\nSo, that's about it for this episode,\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n473\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.692\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n474\n00:23:30.692 --> 00:23:36.860\n[MUSIC].\n\n",

00:00:15.451\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTv.\n\n4\n00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:19.815\nI'm your host Don Pezet back again with\nanother episode of Microsoft Exchange\n\n5\n00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:21.090\n2013.\n\n6\n00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.980\nIn this episode, we're going to be\ntaking a look at Edge Transport Servers.\n\n7\n00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.770\nWhen Exchange 2013 first came out,\nthere were only two roles.\n\n8\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.275\nThere was the mailbox server role and\nthe client access server role.\n\n9\n00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:38.020\nAnd then when Service Pack One came out,\nthey reintroduced one of the older roles\n\n10\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.230\nfrom Exchange, kind of brought it back\ncalled the Edge Transport role, all right?\n\n11\n00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.550\nAnd the reason they didn't roll it out\nin the very beginning was that you could\n\n12\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.700\nactually use Exchange 2012 Edge Transport\nServers just fine with Exchange 2013.\n\n13\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.460\nAnd part of the reason for\nthat was how these servers work.\n\n14\n00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.880\nSo let's talk a little bit about how an\nedge transport server works to see why it\n\n15\n00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.910\ndidn't really matter if we ran 2010 or\n2013, and to this day it still doesn't\n\n16\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.630\nreally matter, but you do want to\nrun the latest software if you can.\n\n17\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.690\nBut let's take a look at a topology and\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n18\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.330\nSo here's an example of an exchange\nenvironment where we've got our\n\n19\n00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.490\ninternal mail servers, right, our client\naccess server and our mailbox server.\n\n20\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.100\nNow, when email is coming into our\norganization, it's generally gonna pass\n\n21\n00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.550\nto the front-end transport service\non the client access server, and\n\n22\n00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.920\nthen go to the hub transport service back\nhere on the mailbox server, all right?\n\n23\n00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.860\nAnd then the mailbox server has\nthe mailbox transport service,\n\n24\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.660\nwhere it actually delivers\nthat content into a mailbox.\n\n25\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.130\nWell, if it's Internet email,\n\n26\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.380\nIt can actually go straight to the hub\ntransport server on the mailbox server.\n\n27\n00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.790\nWe normally do proxy it through\nthe client access server for\n\n28\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.110\nsecurity purposes, but security purposes,\nwhat do I mean by that?\n\n29\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.730\nWell I mean you don't want people directly\n\n30\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.340\nasking your mailbox server cuz if\nthey could compromise that server\n\n31\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.760\nin theory they could access\nother people's mailboxes.\n\n32\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.340\nYou definitely don't want the Internet\nbeing able to access those\n\n33\n00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.470\nmailbox servers.\n\n34\n00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.290\nSo passing through the client access\nserver gives you an extra layer of\n\n35\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.040\ndefense, but it's not much of an extra\nlayer, because that client access server,\n\n36\n00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.520\nif you think about it,\nit's joined to your domain, right?\n\n37\n00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.820\nIt's gotta be joined to the domain,\nbecause Exchange stores its configuration\n\n38\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.850\nin the Active Directory, and so,\nit's a member of your local area network.\n\n39\n00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.680\nIf somebody compromises\nthe client access server,\n\n40\n00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.900\nthey could begin to access resources\ninside your network and that would be bad.\n\n41\n00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.200\nSo, what an edge transport server does,\nis it sits in between.\n\n42\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.050\nIt sits in between your secure, internal\nservers, that we don't want the outside\n\n43\n00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.730\nworld to get to, and the Internet,\nwhere the bad people are.\n\n44\n00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.650\nBad people like all of us\nwatching this show right now.\n\n45\n00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.850\nSo the Edge Transport Server is designed\nto sit in your DMZ and to be isolated\n\n46\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.330\nfrom the network except for the barest\nminimum of communications necessary.\n\n47\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.982\nNow the Edge Transport Server really\ndoes take security to a high level.\n\n48\n00:02:52.982 --> 00:02:55.616\nFor example,\nit's not even joined to the domain, right?\n\n49\n00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:59.496\nIf somebody compromises the Edge Transport\nServer, it's not joined to the domain.\n\n50\n00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:02.337\nIt can't authenticate against\nany server on the inside.\n\n51\n00:03:02.337 --> 00:03:03.840\nIt's not able to communicate.\n\n52\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.480\nIt's a dead end.\n\n53\n00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.670\nThe Edge Transport server also only\nmaintains very minimal email queues.\n\n54\n00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.710\nAn email comes in, it can scan and\n\n55\n00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.130\nfilter email right there, and\nthen send it on into the internal network.\n\n56\n00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.940\nSo if somebody were to compromise this\nsystem the only email they would have\n\n57\n00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.440\naccess to is email that was being\nscanned at that moment as it was being\n\n58\n00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.970\ntransmitted through.\n\n59\n00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.660\nSo fairly secure from that respect too.\n\n60\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.910\nAlso, it doesn't even have\na list of user accounts.\n\n61\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.290\nNow, that might sound kinda weird, right?\n\n62\n00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.580\nThis thing is gonna receive email for us.\n\n63\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.990\nHow does it know who's a good account and\nwho's a bad account?\n\n64\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.380\nAnd it actually does it\nthrough a really slick system.\n\n65\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.050\nWhat happens is the Edge Transport Server,\nit's not joined to our domain.\n\n66\n00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.120\nSo it doesn't have a view\nof Active Directory.\n\n67\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.600\nIt doesn't know what\nuser accounts we have.\n\n68\n00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.870\nIt doesn't even know\nthe exchange configuration, but\n\n69\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.510\nit's got to know something, otherwise\nit's not going to be able to do its job.\n\n70\n00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.830\nSo it leverages what's called the Active\nDirectory Lightweight Directory Services.\n\n71\n00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.390\nWhat the ADLDS does,\nis it lets you run a very\n\n72\n00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.680\nsmall selection of data from\nthe active directory, all right?\n\n73\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.320\nThe example I gave is like a phone book,\nright?\n\n74\n00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.230\nIf you get a phone book,\nyou come here to Gainesville, Florida and\n\n75\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.900\ngrab the Gainesville phonebook,\nif you remember phonebook's,\n\n76\n00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.980\nthe big paper things that\nhave phone numbers in them.\n\n77\n00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.170\nSome of you might not.\n\n78\n00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.720\nBut if you crack open a phonebook\nwhat do you have in there?\n\n79\n00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.880\nYou have a person's name,\nyou have their address, and\n\n80\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.560\nyou have their phone number,\nand that's it, right?\n\n81\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.980\nYou just have enough information to be\nable to find that person and talk to them.\n\n82\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.080\nBut you don't know what\ntheir hair color is.\n\n83\n00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.260\nYou don't know how old they are.\n\n84\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.200\nYou don't know what\nkind of car they drive.\n\n85\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.250\nThat stuff isn't in there.\n\n86\n00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.530\nThe phone book is a very,\nvery simplified version.\n\n87\n00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.980\nWell, that's what\nthe Edge Transport Servers do.\n\n88\n00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.490\nThey have a very, very simplified\nversion of the active directory.\n\n89\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.780\nIn fact it's so simplified that it\nreally just contains a couple of things.\n\n90\n00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.980\nIt contains what mailbox servers\nit needs to talk to, right?\n\n91\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.100\nWhen email comes in,\nit needs to know who to send the email to.\n\n92\n00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.360\nSo it has a list of mailbox servers\nthat it can talk to, right, and\n\n93\n00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.340\nit uses the GUID's of the servers.\n\n94\n00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.490\nSo it doesn't even really\nknow the name of the server.\n\n95\n00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.470\nIt doesn't know that it\nLab dash mailbox 01.\n\n96\n00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.300\nIt just sees the GUID for that server.\n\n97\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.280\nSo, if somebody were to compromise\nthe system, they would just see GUID's.\n\n98\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.170\nAnd then as far as email addresses, it\ndoesn't have them, which is kind of cool.\n\n99\n00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.990\nIf somebody hacks into\nan edge transport server,\n\n100\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.030\nthey can't figure out\nyour email address list.\n\n101\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.000\nWhat it does is your mailbox\nserver on the back end takes all\n\n102\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.140\nthe email addresses from Active Directory\nand Exchange, and it hashes them.\n\n103\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.430\nIt does a SHA-256 one way hash,\nand it takes those hash values and\n\n104\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.680\nit sends them to\nthe Edge Transport Server.\n\n105\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.380\nAnd so when an edge transport server\nreceives and email and it's to deposit or\n\n106\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.530\nto Don@itpro.tv, right?\n\n107\n00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.980\nIt takes take that name, Don@itpro.tv,\nand it does a SHA-256 hash.\n\n108\n00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.340\nAnd then it looks at the hash list from\nthe servers inside, and looks for a match.\n\n109\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.290\nIf it finds a match, that mailbox exists\non the inside and we need to process it.\n\n110\n00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.940\nIf it doesn't find a match,\nit throws the email away.\n\n111\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.982\nSorry, recipient not found.\n\n112\n00:06:05.982 --> 00:06:09.690\nBut the Edge Transport Server doesn't\nactually know what my email address is.\n\n113\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.150\nIt doesn't know that I'm don@itpro.tv,\nit just sees that SHA-256 hash.\n\n114\n00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.150\nSo, another way to have that security,\nif this server gets compromised, somebody\n\n115\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.720\ncan't lift our usernames out of it, they\ncan't lift out e-mail addresses out of it.\n\n116\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.310\nThey just see a big hash table.\n\n117\n00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.740\nRight, and that's that.\n\n118\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.320\nSo, pretty cool, right?\n\n119\n00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.940\nThey really wanted to\nmake this thing as risk\n\n120\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.460\nfree as possible to stick in between us\nand the network, and the internet, right?\n\n121\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.350\nNow, you don't have to use an Edge\ntransport server, plenty of people don't.\n\n122\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.640\nInstead of using an Edge transport server,\n\n123\n00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.290\nyou might use a third party product,\nlike a Barracuda spam and virus firewall.\n\n124\n00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.270\nIt kinda serves the same purpose, right?\n\n125\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.250\nIt sits in your DMZ, in between the\nInternet and your internal network, and\n\n126\n00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.640\nit does filtering before content even\nmakes it inside of your network so\n\n127\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.220\nthat's kinda cool.\n\n128\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.170\nBut by doing edge transport servers we've\ngot Microsoft Edge transport servers.\n\n129\n00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.080\nWe have Microsoft exchange servers and\nit's all running on top of Windows.\n\n130\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.630\nWe have a common environment, right?\n\n131\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.370\nWe have a common,\n\n132\n00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.680\nconsistent environment with one company\nthat we need to reach out to for support\n\n133\n00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.380\nand that's one of the big benefits of\ndoing an Edge transport server like this.\n\n134\n00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.260\nAll right.\n\n135\n00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.460\nBut it is a weird beast, right?\n\n136\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.420\nIt's a lot different than the other\nservers, so getting an Edge transport\n\n137\n00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.350\nserver installed is a pretty\ninteresting process, all right?\n\n138\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.550\nThere's a few things we need to do, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.050\nStep one, we need to get a server, right?\n\n140\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.990\nSo you get a physical server and\nyou provision it in your DMZ, so\n\n141\n00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.990\nwe're gonna deploy that server here in our\nDMZ, so not on our local area network.\n\n142\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.670\nIt's gonna start in this separate network\nwhere we expose it to the Internet.\n\n143\n00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.610\nThen we need to configure\nsome firewall rules.\n\n144\n00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.250\nOkay.\n\n145\n00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.560\nNotice how I've got two firewalls.\n\n146\n00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.920\nYou might have two firewalls,\nyou might have one firewall, but\n\n147\n00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.570\nhopefully you have at least\na firewall in your environment.\n\n148\n00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.400\nWe need to allow SMTP port 25 in and\n\n149\n00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.940\nout, between the Internet and\nthe Edge Transport server.\n\n150\n00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.480\nRight?\n\n151\n00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.832\nWe're gonna change our mail\nexchanger records to point to\n\n152\n00:07:53.832 --> 00:07:56.765\nthe Edge Transport Server instead of\npointing to some internal server.\n\n153\n00:07:56.765 --> 00:07:58.660\nSo, the outside world, the Internet,\n\n154\n00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.351\nneeds to be able to connect\nto the Edge Transport Server.\n\n155\n00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:04.230\nSo SMTP port 25, or TCB port 25 in and\n\n156\n00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.810\nout on our public firewall,\non our WAN connection.\n\n157\n00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.470\nOn the LAN side we need the DMZ,\nwe need this Edge Transport Server\n\n158\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.070\nto be able to communicate with SMTP\nport 25 to our mailbox servers.\n\n159\n00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.274\nOkay, not to the client access servers,\nI've kind of got that drawn here cuz I was\n\n160\n00:08:20.274 --> 00:08:23.140\nusing it for another example but,\nif do it that way, there.\n\n161\n00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.440\nIt actually connects directly\nto the mailbox server.\n\n162\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.540\nWe don't need the front end transport\nservice because our Edge Transport Server\n\n163\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.260\nis the front end transport service.\n\n164\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.800\nWe need to connect to the hub\ntransport service which is back in our\n\n165\n00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.880\nmailbox server.\n\n166\n00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.920\nSo we need SMTP TCP port 25 to be\nopen inbound and outbound, okay?\n\n167\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.380\nInbound, we need the DMZ server to be\nable to send email to the mailbox server.\n\n168\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.210\nAnd outbound, we need the mailbox\nserver to be able to relay\n\n169\n00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.620\nthrough the Edge Transport Server\non the way out.\n\n170\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.520\nYou don't have to do that,\nbut it's good practice.\n\n171\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.790\nIt's a good practice to be sending your\nin and out through this one place,\n\n172\n00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.190\nthat way we can set up filtering\nrules one place, right.\n\n173\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.492\nThe other thing is there's one extra\nspecial port that we have to approve,\n\n174\n00:09:03.492 --> 00:09:04.390\nall right?\n\n175\n00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.770\nSMTP, we know we need that,\ncuz that's how email comes in, and\n\n176\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.870\nthat's how email goes out,\nso we gotta have those.\n\n177\n00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:14.750\nBut, the Edge Transport Server,\nit can't see the Active Directory, right?\n\n178\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.880\nIt's using\nthe Lightweight Directory Service, and\n\n179\n00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.920\nit's gonna populate that with data,\nlike those hashes for user accounts.\n\n180\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.800\nSo anytime I add a new mailbox back here,\n\n181\n00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.700\nthe Edge Transport Server has\nto find out about it, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.510\nBut we don't want\nthe Edge Transport Server to reach\n\n183\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.280\ninto our network to get that data.\n\n184\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.600\nWe don't want that, cuz then if\nsomebody compromised the server,\n\n185\n00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.550\nthey could reach in and get the data.\n\n186\n00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:42.270\nSo what we need to do is approve for the\nmailboxes to push the changes to the DMZ.\n\n187\n00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:47.610\nIn other words, an internal server can\nsend data to the Edge Transport Server,\n\n188\n00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.710\nthe Edge Transport Server can't talk back.\n\n189\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.483\nAnd that means that if the Edge Transport\nServer gets compromised, they can't send\n\n190\n00:09:52.483 --> 00:09:55.233\ndata back to change the configuration,\nthey can't manipulate things like that.\n\n191\n00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:59.120\nThey can just damage the Edge Server,\nthey can't do anything else, right?\n\n192\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.940\nBut we can make changes all we want on the\ninside and they'll push to the DMZ server.\n\n193\n00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.409\nNow all of that's done on TCP port 50636.\n\n194\n00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:15.714\nSo 50,636, it's a port that Microsoft\npicked, it's not a registered port.\n\n195\n00:10:15.714 --> 00:10:20.120\nIt's just one of the freely available\nones that they use, so 50636.\n\n196\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:26.090\nYou want it outbound, the mailbox server\nto the Edge Transport Server, right?\n\n197\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.950\nNot the other way around, don't do\nEdge Transport Server back in, all right?\n\n198\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.600\nAnd if you have more\nthan one mailbox server,\n\n199\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.030\nthey all need to be able to connect\nto the Edge Transport Server.\n\n200\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.880\nBecause if one fails, another server's\ngotta push those changes, right?\n\n201\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.590\nSo we need to approve that for\neach one, all right?\n\n202\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.280\nNow, if you've got\nActive Directory sites configured,\n\n203\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.140\nthen you've got mailbox servers in\ndifferent sites and you'll likely\n\n204\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.800\nhave different Edge Transport Servers\nin those different sites.\n\n205\n00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.940\nSo when I approve this for the firewall,\nit's all within the same site, right?\n\n206\n00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.960\nSo mailbox servers in this site need to be\nable to talk to the Edge Transport Server.\n\n207\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.210\nIf I have other sites, they don't need to\nbe able to talk to it because their email\n\n208\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.120\nis gonna come to this site first and\nthen go out to the DMZ.\n\n209\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.800\nSo think in terms of\nActive Directory sites.\n\n210\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.830\nSo on the network side, that's one\nof the things that I need to do.\n\n211\n00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.310\nSecond, I need to build up my server.\n\n212\n00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.369\nNow the server needs to be Windows Server\n2008 R2 or Windows Server 2012.\n\n213\n00:11:17.369 --> 00:11:21.480\nAnd then we can install the Exchange\n2013 system on here and\n\n214\n00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.440\nchoose the Edge Transport role.\n\n215\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.070\nNow you can do it from the command\nline using the setup command, or\n\n216\n00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.640\nyou can use the GUI to do it.\n\n217\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.520\nBut either way there is\none prerequisite we need.\n\n218\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.330\nRemember we installed Exchange\n2013 in our other episodes,\n\n219\n00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.470\nthere were a ton of prerequisites,\nI had to do a lot.\n\n220\n00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.287\nWe had to do\nthe Unified Communications Framework,\n\n221\n00:11:38.287 --> 00:11:43.223\nwe had to do .NET Framework 4.5, we had to\ndo the Windows Management Framework 4.0.\n\n222\n00:11:43.223 --> 00:11:46.550\nWe had to do a ton of roles and features.\n\n223\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.260\nI had a little script\nthat I ran that did that,\n\n224\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.950\nif you've seen the episode,\nit's a lot of stuff.\n\n225\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.520\nOn an Edge Transport Server\nthere's only one prerequisite, and\n\n226\n00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.040\nthat's the Active Directory\nLightweight Directory Service.\n\n227\n00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.160\nSo we need to get that installed\nbefore we can install Exchange.\n\n228\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.870\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n229\n00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.630\nSo here I am on an Edge Transport Server,\nI just called it LAB-EDGE01.\n\n230\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.660\nAnd if I look at the server,\nit's just in a work group.\n\n231\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.000\nI didn't join it to my domain,\nthis is gonna be going in my DMZ so\n\n232\n00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.900\ndon't bother joining it to the domain,\nit's just a stand alone server, okay.\n\n233\n00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.710\nIt is a good idea to have the server\nwith a static IP address.\n\n234\n00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.410\nAnd we actually do need to\nconfigure a little bit of DNS.\n\n235\n00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.590\nBasically the Edge Transport Server,\nremember how I said we need TCP\n\n236\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:31.840\nport 25 to be able to send SMTP traffic\nto the mailbox servers on the inside?\n\n237\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.640\nOur Edge Transport Server needs to\nbe able to resolve the DNS name\n\n238\n00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.550\nof our mailbox servers, and\nthe reverse needs to be true also.\n\n239\n00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.940\nThe mailbox servers need to be\nable to resolve the DNS entry for\n\n240\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.200\nour Edge Transport Server.\n\n241\n00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.400\nSo we probably need to have a static IP so\nwe can do DNS entries for that.\n\n242\n00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.450\nNow on mine, this is a default install so\nI'm in a work group and\n\n243\n00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.690\nI have a DHCP address.\n\n244\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:58.080\nSo I'm gonna change that, I'm gonna come\nin here and modify my IP address and\n\n245\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.300\nI'm gonna statically assign it.\n\n246\n00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.750\nSo I'll just punch that in here and\n\n247\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:07.260\nI'll make this one, we'll do .14 and\nI'll punch in its gateway.\n\n248\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.840\nNow, your DMZ network probably has a\ndifferent address, so you'll have to punch\n\n249\n00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.010\nin IP address that's appropriate for\nyours, and a DNS server you can use.\n\n250\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.850\nAnd that DNS server needs to be able to\nresolve those internal server names, so\n\n251\n00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.220\nyou might need to set up\na dedicated DNS server for this.\n\n252\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.870\nI'm just gonna use an internal one,\nall right.\n\n253\n00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:28.510\nNow, on the DNS side, I need a DNS entry,\nand I need to have a name and\n\n254\n00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.280\na domain, a fully qualified domain name.\n\n255\n00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.428\nNow, normally we get that domain name from\nbeing joined to the Active Directory.\n\n256\n00:13:34.428 --> 00:13:38.870\nI'm not joined to the Active Directory so\nI'm gonna need to set that on the server.\n\n257\n00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.630\nSo, I'm gonna go in here and\ntake my server name.\n\n258\n00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.840\nI've got this computer name up here and\n\n259\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.810\nI'll click on that and\nI'm gonna go into Change.\n\n260\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.300\nAnd I'm not gonna change\nthe computer name but\n\n261\n00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.350\nif I hit More,\nI can set my primary DNS suffix.\n\n262\n00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.940\nAnd I've been using the ITProTV.net\ndomain so I'll do ITProTV.net.\n\n263\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.544\nAnd that way my server knows, yeah,\nyou're not joined at the domain, but\n\n264\n00:14:01.544 --> 00:14:05.872\nyour fully qualified name is\nLAB-EDGE01.itprotv.net, okay.\n\n265\n00:14:05.872 --> 00:14:08.937\nSo I'll go ahead and save that.\n\n266\n00:14:08.937 --> 00:14:10.850\nAnd now I've got it set, all right?\n\n267\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.440\nNow I do need to restart for\nthat to take effect, so I'll go ahead and\n\n268\n00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.310\nlet it restart.\n\n269\n00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.320\nWell, actually I could do one more thing.\n\n270\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.920\nI'm gonna do restart later, because\n\n271\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.890\nI need to install the Active Directory\nLightweight Directory Services role.\n\n272\n00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.580\nAnd so I can do that real quick and\nthen reboot,\n\n273\n00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.520\nand kinda kill two birds with one stone.\n\n274\n00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.740\nSo I'll go up here to Manage\nin Add Roles and Features.\n\n275\n00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.530\nAnd in my Role list, if I can ever get it,\nhere we go, you can look down and\n\n276\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.240\nthere's the Active Directory\nLightweight Directory Services.\n\n277\n00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.310\nI'm just gonna check that one off and\nwe'll add that feature and\n\n278\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.020\nwe'll let it get installed.\n\n279\n00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.862\nI'm not checking anything else,\njust kinda letting it go.\n\n280\n00:14:42.862 --> 00:14:46.565\nThat's the only prerequisite that I had so\nI'll get that installed and\n\n281\n00:14:46.565 --> 00:14:48.799\nthen we can reboot the server, all right?\n\n282\n00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:54.499\nThe install's pretty quick cuz LDS is\npretty lightweight, thus the name.\n\n283\n00:14:54.499 --> 00:14:57.599\nSo there's not much for\nit to install and get going.\n\n284\n00:14:57.599 --> 00:15:01.671\nBut while we're waiting on that I can\njump over to my domain controller,\n\n285\n00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:03.780\nwhich is parked over here.\n\n286\n00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.020\nAnd I can go into DNS and\nI can start to set up my DNS entries.\n\n287\n00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.696\nNow, I could have set up dynamic DNS\nregistration, but we're not normally\n\n288\n00:15:10.696 --> 00:15:14.384\ngonna open that on the firewall for\nour Edge Transport Server to get inside.\n\n289\n00:15:14.384 --> 00:15:16.555\nSo you're normally gonna have\nto manually create these.\n\n290\n00:15:16.555 --> 00:15:20.595\nAnd so if I go in my forward lookup zone,\nI can see my internal servers.\n\n291\n00:15:20.595 --> 00:15:25.018\nAnd I'm just gonna add a new\nentry in here, a new A record,\n\n292\n00:15:25.018 --> 00:15:29.175\nwhich I'll call LAB-EDGE01.ITProTV.net,\nand\n\n293\n00:15:29.175 --> 00:15:34.260\nI'll punch in its IP address\nthat we assign to it, all right.\n\n294\n00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.150\nAnd what that's gonna do is it's gonna\nmake it where my internal servers,\n\n295\n00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:41.120\nmy mailbox servers, will be able to\nresolve the Edge Transport Server by name.\n\n296\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.020\nAnd my Edge Server pointing here\nwill be able to resolve my internal\n\n297\n00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.010\nservers by name.\n\n298\n00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.390\nSo now we've got name resolution,\nthat's really important,\n\n299\n00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.522\notherwise this whole thing doesn't work.\n\n300\n00:15:48.522 --> 00:15:53.030\nAll right, so back here, this one's\nfinished installing, we can go ahead and\n\n301\n00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.119\nrestart this guy.\n\n302\n00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:59.678\nAnd once it restarts, it's got its\nIP address, it's got its DNS name.\n\n303\n00:15:59.678 --> 00:16:02.729\nThen we're ready to install Exchange,\nokay?\n\n304\n00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:06.760\nNow when we install Exchange,\nthere is something we need to remember.\n\n305\n00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.730\nWe've got three roles in Exchange,\nClient Access server, Mailbox server, and\n\n306\n00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.120\nEdge Transport server.\n\n307\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.640\nAnd in other episodes, I mentioned how\nyou could have a server be a dedicated\n\n308\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.650\nClient Access Server, or a dedicated\nMailbox Server, or it could be both.\n\n309\n00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.310\nIt could be the Client Access and\nMailbox server.\n\n310\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.290\nBut Edge Transport,\nalways has to be alone, all right.\n\n311\n00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.035\nIf you install\nthe Edge Transport Service on a server,\n\n312\n00:16:28.035 --> 00:16:30.670\nit cannot be a Client Access or\nMailbox server also.\n\n313\n00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.338\nIt can only be Edge Transport and\nthat's because it's supposed to be\n\n314\n00:16:33.338 --> 00:16:35.730\nstuck out in the DMZ, and\nit's supposed to be secure.\n\n315\n00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.836\nIf you install these other\nroles we start to lose that.\n\n316\n00:16:37.836 --> 00:16:40.910\nThey have to be joined to the Active\nDirectory, Edge Transport doesn't.\n\n317\n00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.572\nNow, you can join your Edge Transport\nserver to the Active Directory if you\n\n318\n00:16:45.572 --> 00:16:46.170\nwant to.\n\n319\n00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.460\nIt's not really recommended.\n\n320\n00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.460\nWe're going for security here,\nbut you can, it'll do that.\n\n321\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.092\nBut it does have to be by itself.\n\n322\n00:16:53.092 --> 00:16:57.317\nAll right, so that server is rebooted,\nand when I get logged back into it,\n\n323\n00:16:57.317 --> 00:16:59.412\nnow I'm ready to install Exchange.\n\n324\n00:16:59.412 --> 00:17:03.625\nAll right, so from here I can launch\nmy Exchange installation disc, and\n\n325\n00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:05.292\nI'll do it through the GUI.\n\n326\n00:17:05.292 --> 00:17:07.359\nFrom the command line\nif you just setup.exe,\n\n327\n00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.162\nit's got some command line modifiers.\n\n328\n00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:12.996\nSo you can say /r: and\nthat's gonna tell it to install a role and\n\n329\n00:17:12.996 --> 00:17:17.912\nthen you just et for Edge Transport and\nthat'll install the Edge Transport role.\n\n330\n00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:21.872\nBut here I'm just gonna do it through the\nGUI where it's a nice little check box.\n\n331\n00:17:21.872 --> 00:17:26.363\nNow if I pick Client Access or\nif I pick the Mailbox role,\n\n332\n00:17:26.363 --> 00:17:29.622\nit's not gonna me pick Edge Transport.\n\n333\n00:17:29.622 --> 00:17:33.263\nBut once I'm picking Edge Transport it\nwon't let me Client Access or Mailbox, so\n\n334\n00:17:33.263 --> 00:17:36.712\nit kinda saves you from making that\nmistake, but it's not that big of a deal.\n\n335\n00:17:36.712 --> 00:17:40.582\nHere it's just copying over some files and\ngetting those cached and ready.\n\n336\n00:17:40.582 --> 00:17:45.082\nAnd then as soon as it's done it's gonna\nask about some default settings as far as\n\n337\n00:17:45.082 --> 00:17:47.082\nthe customer experience program.\n\n338\n00:17:47.082 --> 00:17:50.980\nAnd then I'll be able to pick my roles and\nmove from there.\n\n339\n00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.050\nIf you haven't installed LDS, we'll\nget a red flag telling us it's missing\n\n340\n00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.990\nthe requirement and we can go and\ncorrect it and get it done.\n\n341\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.120\nSo if you forget it it'll keep you honest.\n\n342\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.250\nAll right, so here it's just getting\nthings ready to launch that install and\n\n343\n00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:05.970\nthen we'll get installed.\n\n344\n00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.350\nNow when you install the Edge Transport\nserver it can't see the AD.\n\n345\n00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.420\nIt's not joined at the domain.\n\n346\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.460\nSo it's up, it's running but\nit's completely useless.\n\n347\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.000\nSo once the install's actually\ndone we're gonna have to\n\n348\n00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.340\nconnect it to our internal environment.\n\n349\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.960\nSo there's a lot more work than\njust doing the basic install.\n\n350\n00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.760\nAll right, I'm gonna agree to my licensing\nagreement and I'll use recommended\n\n351\n00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.830\nsettings for the experience program and\nthen here's where I get to pick my roles.\n\n352\n00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.470\nNow, if I choose Mailbox or\nClient Access, Edge Transport grayed out.\n\n353\n00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.610\nIf I choose Edge Transport\nit grays the other ones out.\n\n354\n00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.207\nSo I can just be an Edge Transport\nserver and that's what I want, so\n\n355\n00:18:38.207 --> 00:18:39.950\nwe'll go ahead and install it.\n\n356\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.887\nAnd this is one of that fastest installs\nthat Exchange does because it doesn't need\n\n357\n00:18:43.887 --> 00:18:47.656\nmailbox databases, it doesn't need\nthe special services in the background,\n\n358\n00:18:47.656 --> 00:18:50.830\nit doesn't need unified communication,\nit doesn't need IaaS.\n\n359\n00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:55.184\nIt just needs LDS, some mail queues and\nthe SMTP service, so it's gonna get\n\n360\n00:18:55.184 --> 00:19:00.250\ninstalled, and then I'll be up and\nrunning as an Edge Transport server.\n\n361\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.120\nIt's also gonna install\nthe Exchange Management Tools,\n\n362\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.270\nwhich is kinda nice because\nI'm gonna need those.\n\n363\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.200\nBecause when this is done,\n\n364\n00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.740\nwhat we have to do is generate\nwhat's called an Edge Subscription.\n\n365\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.420\nWhat's an Edge Subscription?\n\n366\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.030\nWell if we go back to my diagram here,\nI mentioned how the Mailbox Servers\n\n367\n00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.650\nare gonna be allowed to push changes\nto the Edge Transport server.\n\n368\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:19.290\nOkay?\n\n369\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.030\nWell, that's what called\nan Edge Subscription.\n\n370\n00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.860\nThe Edge Server will subscribe\nto receiving those changes.\n\n371\n00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.000\nIt basically creates a key,\nlike a private key,\n\n372\n00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.600\nto be able to authenticate and\nwe put that key on our Mailbox servers.\n\n373\n00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.890\nAnd the Mailbox servers can then send\nchanges to the Edge Transport server and\n\n374\n00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.220\nit looks at the key and\ndetermines whether valid or not.\n\n375\n00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.810\nAnd if it's valid, it applies the changes\nand if it's not valid it rejects them, so\n\n376\n00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.830\nit has a basic degree of security.\n\n377\n00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.600\nBut we've got to set that up.\n\n378\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.290\nAnd then once we've got\nthe Edge Subscription in place,\n\n379\n00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.906\nwe can start up what's called EdgeSync.\n\n380\n00:19:53.906 --> 00:19:58.800\nAnd with EdgeSync, the Mailbox servers\nwill start to synchronize changes out\n\n381\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.010\nto the Edge Transport server.\n\n382\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.180\nAll right, now how does that work?\n\n383\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.510\nWell there's actually two different things\nthat we're replicating when we send out to\n\n384\n00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.810\nthe Edge Transport server.\n\n385\n00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.254\nThe first part is our basic\nserver configuration and\n\n386\n00:20:10.254 --> 00:20:14.330\ninformation there,\nthings like what are accepted domains.\n\n387\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.794\nIf you've got five different\ndomains in Exchange,\n\n388\n00:20:16.794 --> 00:20:19.340\nthe Edge Transport server\nneeds to know that.\n\n389\n00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.940\nCuz any other domain it's gonna\nreject as an unauthorized relay.\n\n390\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.800\nSo that data is being\nsynchronized once every hour, so\n\n391\n00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.428\nevery one hour the Mailbox server\nis sending that data up, okay.\n\n392\n00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:35.480\nBut then there's the recipient data,\nall the mailboxes that we have.\n\n393\n00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.810\nWhen you create a mailbox,\nthat has to get hashed and\n\n394\n00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.310\nhas to get sent up to\nthe Edge Transport server, all right.\n\n395\n00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.200\nThat happen every four hours, all right.\n\n396\n00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.550\nEvery four hours,\nthat's kind of a long time.\n\n397\n00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.920\nThat means it's only happening,\nwhat is that, six times a day.\n\n398\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.320\nSo, if you just added a new user\nmailbox and you need it to be active,\n\n399\n00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.050\nright now you're gonna have to wait.\n\n400\n00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.230\nIt depends on where\nyou're at in that time.\n\n401\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.400\nIt might be another four hours before it\nreplicates, it might be another two hours,\n\n402\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.230\nyou don't know where\nyou are in that window.\n\n403\n00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.450\nSo we can always force that subscription\nto happen, force that sync to happen.\n\n404\n00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.570\nBut you've got the Edge Subscription.\n\n405\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.420\nThat's the authenticated connection that\nwe build between the Mailbox servers and\n\n406\n00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.580\nthe Edge Transport server.\n\n407\n00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.520\nAnd then you've got EdgeSync, which is\nactually synchronizing that stuff along.\n\n408\n00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.880\nSo we'll get a chance to see that.\n\n409\n00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.270\nNow in the chat room we got the question,\ndoes it need to be set up on both servers?\n\n410\n00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.060\nDo they need to be running?\n\n411\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.340\nWhat you do is you generate\nthe subscription on your Edge server and\n\n412\n00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.340\nthen it creates a file.\n\n413\n00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.090\nAnd you take that file to\nyour internal Mailbox server.\n\n414\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.510\nAnd you can pick any Mailbox\nserver you want in your site, and\n\n415\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.800\nyou import it there, and\nthat's what creates the subscription.\n\n416\n00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.027\nNow, when you do that it'll create\nthe subscription on all the mailbox\n\n417\n00:21:42.027 --> 00:21:43.374\nservers in that site.\n\n418\n00:21:43.374 --> 00:21:47.928\nAll right, but if you add another mailbox\nserver in the future in that site you'll\n\n419\n00:21:47.928 --> 00:21:52.614\nneed to rerun it you'll need to re-import\nthat file again because it won't add it to\n\n420\n00:21:52.614 --> 00:21:53.874\nnew Mailbox servers.\n\n421\n00:21:53.874 --> 00:21:56.829\nNow you might not care about that\nif you've already got five servers,\n\n422\n00:21:56.829 --> 00:22:00.235\nsending out to the Edge Transport Server\nthat's more then enough you don't need\n\n423\n00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:01.254\nthat sixth one to do it.\n\n424\n00:22:01.254 --> 00:22:04.886\nBut if you only had one before and now\nyou're adding a second Mailbox server for\n\n425\n00:22:04.886 --> 00:22:08.370\nredundancy, well, you'll want that\none to have the edge subscription.\n\n426\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.550\nSo you'll just need to re-import the file.\n\n427\n00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.750\nYou don't have to regenerate the file, you\ncan just re-import the same file again and\n\n428\n00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:13.560\nit'll set those up.\n\n429\n00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.000\nSo at this point\nthe install's gonna run and\n\n430\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.630\nwe're gonna watch this little\nblue bar creep across the screen.\n\n431\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.340\nAnd when it's done we'll need\nto get our subscription set up.\n\n432\n00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.345\nNow, I don't wanna bore\nyou guys with this and\n\n433\n00:22:23.345 --> 00:22:26.080\nthey're actually kinda running a little\nshort on time in this episode anyway.\n\n434\n00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.020\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n435\n00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.750\nWhy don't we wrap up this episode here,\nand we'll do a part two.\n\n436\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.020\nAnd in part two we'll verify\nthe installation completed, and\n\n437\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.720\nwe'll go ahead and\nset up that subscription and\n\n438\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.180\nget it communicating with our\nservers inside of the network.\n\n439\n00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.040\nWe'll get a chance to see that process and\nget it all done in action.\n\n440\n00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.280\nSo definitely stay tuned for the sequel,\nthe exciting conclusion to this episode.\n\n441\n00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.120\nBut for this episode,\nwe'll go ahead and wrap here.\n\n442\n00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.250\nWhat we got a chance to see today were\nwhat an Edge Transport server was,\n\n443\n00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.840\nwhere it falls in your network, and\n\n444\n00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.880\nhow to get the prerequisites taken\ncare of to do that initial install.\n\n445\n00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.450\nWe got it all knocked out here so\nwe're ready to move on but\n\n446\n00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.960\nwe'll do that in part two.\n\n447\n00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.500\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n448\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.250\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet,\nand I'll see you next time.\n\n449\n00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:13.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.158\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:20.342\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again with\nanother episode of Microsoft Exchange\n\n5\n00:00:20.342 --> 00:00:22.871\n2013, and not just any old episode, right?\n\n6\n00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:26.764\nThis is the exciting conclusion to\nour two part series on installing\n\n7\n00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:29.649\nthe Edge Transport\nserver in Exchange 2013.\n\n8\n00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.817\nIn our last episode, we left off with,\nwell, with the role installing, right?\n\n9\n00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:36.526\nAnd so we had a little blue bar\nkinda creeping across our screen and\n\n10\n00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:37.074\nthat was it.\n\n11\n00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:40.667\nWell, in that episode we talked about\nwhat the Edge Transport server was,\n\n12\n00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:44.160\nand how to get that install going,\nnow we need to make it active.\n\n13\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.610\nSo once the install finishes,\nyou reboot your server, and\n\n14\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.040\nnow we've gotta connect it\nto our internal systems.\n\n15\n00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.210\nBut remember, the Edge Transport\nserver's supposed to sit in the DMZ, and\n\n16\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.910\nit's not allowed to reach in and\nmake changes in the inside network.\n\n17\n00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.616\nSo what we have to do,\nis we have to generate the subscription\n\n18\n00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:05.904\non our Edge Transport server,\ntake that subscription inside to one of\n\n19\n00:01:05.904 --> 00:01:10.569\nour mailbox servers, and actually\ncreate the subscription on the inside.\n\n20\n00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:13.635\nAnd then that sort of will push the\nchanges back out to the Edge server, so\n\n21\n00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:15.596\nit's kind of a circle, right?\n\n22\n00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:18.782\nWell, when we generate an Edge\nsubscription, what you're really doing,\n\n23\n00:01:18.782 --> 00:01:21.093\nis generating authentication credentials,\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:23.284\nThe Edge Transport server is\nnot joined to your domain.\n\n25\n00:01:23.284 --> 00:01:26.487\nIt doesn't have some user account\nthat we can use to connect to it, so\n\n26\n00:01:26.487 --> 00:01:28.080\nwe need something else.\n\n27\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.225\nAnd the Edge subscription basically\ncontains a security key, so\n\n28\n00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:34.607\nthis is like generating a private key,\npublic key pair kind of thing.\n\n29\n00:01:34.607 --> 00:01:37.788\nWe're generating this private key\nthat we'll take to the inside, and\n\n30\n00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:39.430\nwe need to do that securely.\n\n31\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.305\nSo let me show you the process of\nactually getting that connected, and\n\n32\n00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:43.192\ngetting it in place.\n\n33\n00:01:43.192 --> 00:01:46.398\nSo here I've got the server from the last\nepisode, it finished installing, and\n\n34\n00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.630\nit rebooted,\nyou do have to reboot after the install.\n\n35\n00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.545\nAnd now that it's up, I'm in\nEdge Transport server, it's very exciting,\n\n36\n00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.847\nexcept the server's not\ndoing a darn thing.\n\n37\n00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:57.150\nIf it doesn't have a subscription,\nit's not gonna work,\n\n38\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.690\nso it's just sitting here doing nothing,\nall right?\n\n39\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.120\nSo now, I need to go in and\ncreate a subscription, and\n\n40\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.173\nwe do it from\nthe Exchange Management Shell.\n\n41\n00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:08.757\nSo I'm gonna get into my Exchange\nManagement Shell, and once I'm in there,\n\n42\n00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:11.719\nI'll be able to generate\nthat subscription, and\n\n43\n00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.130\nit's just an XML file that we generate.\n\n44\n00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.633\nSo I'm gonna use\nthe New-EdgeSubscription commandlet, and\n\n45\n00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:19.624\nit'll create this XML file for me.\n\n46\n00:02:19.624 --> 00:02:24.532\nOnce I've got the XML file, I need to copy\nit to like a USB key, or burn it to CD, or\n\n47\n00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:28.540\nsomething like that, and\ntake it inside my network, all right?\n\n48\n00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.751\nThe idea here is that\nyour server's in the DMZ.\n\n49\n00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.837\nIf you're setting the server up on your\nLAN first and then you're going to move\n\n50\n00:02:33.837 --> 00:02:36.500\nit to the DMZ, then you can actually\ncopy it across the network, but\n\n51\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.820\nnormally we would use like a USB key.\n\n52\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.779\nSo I'm going to come in here and\nsay New-EdgeSubscription, and then,\n\n53\n00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:48.250\n-FileName, and the name of the XML\nfile I wanna generate, and so\n\n54\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.850\nI'll just create C:\\EdgeSub.xml,\nall right?\n\n55\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.052\nAnd so that's gonna generate,\nand here it is,\n\n56\n00:02:54.052 --> 00:02:56.197\njust giving me a little\nbit of notice about it,\n\n57\n00:02:56.197 --> 00:02:59.775\nthat I'm generating this to set up\nEdgeSync replication, and that this file\n\n58\n00:02:59.775 --> 00:03:04.130\ndoes contain some information in it that's\nsecure, and so I need to handle it safely.\n\n59\n00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.972\nAnd then its warning me right here, I need\nto complete the subscription in the next\n\n60\n00:03:08.972 --> 00:03:12.358\n1440 minutes, in other words,\nthis file expires.\n\n61\n00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.953\nSo if somebody else gets a hold\nof my subscription down the road,\n\n62\n00:03:14.953 --> 00:03:16.680\nits not gonna be any good to them, right?\n\n63\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.775\nThis file is only good for 1440 minutes.\n\n64\n00:03:20.775 --> 00:03:23.179\nSo I'll go ahead and\nsay Yes to generate it, and\n\n65\n00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:25.118\nits gonna build a subscription file.\n\n66\n00:03:25.118 --> 00:03:27.793\nAll right, now what's in that file?\n\n67\n00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:31.160\nIf I browse on my hard drive,\nto my C drive, this is where I put it.\n\n68\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.350\nRight there is EdgeSub, and if I open\nit up, it is just an XML file, right?\n\n69\n00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.427\nAnd so if we look in here at it,\nwhat does it have?\n\n70\n00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:43.383\nWell, we start off with some basic\ninformation, here's my server, LAB-EDGE01,\n\n71\n00:03:43.383 --> 00:03:46.431\nIt's got the name of the server,\nLAB-EDGE01.itprotv.net,\n\n72\n00:03:46.431 --> 00:03:48.440\nthat's that fully qualified name.\n\n73\n00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.670\nRemember in the first episode I\nsaid we had to have valid DNS name\n\n74\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.420\nresolution between the systems?\n\n75\n00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.981\nHere's where it gets that name.\n\n76\n00:03:54.981 --> 00:03:58.480\nAnd then right here, EdgeCertificateBlob.\n\n77\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.180\nThere's that private key, that\nauthentication that it's gonna be using\n\n78\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.360\nand that is a long, long line, right?\n\n79\n00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.430\nThat's the whole giant value\nthat represents that key,\n\n80\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.610\nthat's what we have to keep safe,\nall right?\n\n81\n00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.840\nBecause for the next 1440 minutes,\n\n82\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.850\nif somebody gets a hold of that,\nthey could create a false subscription,\n\n83\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.580\nand they could start pushing changes onto\nyour Edge server and they could turn it\n\n84\n00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.900\ninto a spam relay if they wanted, so\nwe have to make sure to keep this secure.\n\n85\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.436\nThink of it as like your\nadministrator password, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:25.436 --> 00:04:28.348\nAnd then you got the effective date and\nthe duration,\n\n87\n00:04:28.348 --> 00:04:31.914\nthat's where it's getting\nthat 1440 minutes, all right?\n\n88\n00:04:31.914 --> 00:04:34.583\nSo I've got all that right there,\nnow I just need to take this and\n\n89\n00:04:34.583 --> 00:04:35.880\nbring it in on my other server.\n\n90\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.927\nNow, notice right here, this server type.\n\n91\n00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:42.679\nThe server type is some really\ncrazy characters here, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:47.153\nThere's actually some binary data right in\nthere, and that's gonna cause a little bit\n\n93\n00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:51.084\nof a problem when we do the import on\nthis, and so we'll see the import command\n\n94\n00:04:51.084 --> 00:04:54.918\nis a little bit weird because of that,\nbut just be aware that that is there.\n\n95\n00:04:54.918 --> 00:04:59.780\nAll right, so my next step is to take this\nfile and copy it to my internal server.\n\n96\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.605\nNow normally I'd send this to a USB key,\nbut because I'm in a lab,\n\n97\n00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:04.180\nI can actually do it over my network.\n\n98\n00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.769\nWe wouldn't normally want to do that,\nbut I'll send it across.\n\n99\n00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:12.101\nSo I'm gonna browse over to my mailbox\nserver, and just paste it over there, so\n\n100\n00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:14.140\nit's on the mailbox server, all right?\n\n101\n00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.914\nBy doing it with a USB key,\nI can have them on separate networks and\n\n102\n00:05:16.914 --> 00:05:17.928\nmaintain my security.\n\n103\n00:05:17.928 --> 00:05:21.099\nAll right,\nnow I can jump over to my mailbox server.\n\n104\n00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.812\nAnd so here I am on LAB-MAILBOX01, and you\ncan pick any of the mailbox servers that\n\n105\n00:05:24.812 --> 00:05:28.002\nare in the same active directory site\nto create this Edge subscription,\n\n106\n00:05:28.002 --> 00:05:28.837\ncuz when you do it,\n\n107\n00:05:28.837 --> 00:05:32.110\nit creates the subscription across\nall the mailbox servers in that site.\n\n108\n00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.650\nSo here I'm gonna get into my\nExchange Management Shell also, and\n\n109\n00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.380\nI'm going to import that subscription.\n\n110\n00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.376\nNow the command for\ndoing it's actually not that bad.\n\n111\n00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:47.276\nThe command itself would be\nNew-EdgeSubscription, and\n\n112\n00:05:47.276 --> 00:05:50.976\nthen file name and\nyou specify the file, but\n\n113\n00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:54.310\nI'm gonna have a bit of a problem here.\n\n114\n00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.128\nThe binary data in that file is\ngonna cause an issue, and so\n\n115\n00:05:57.128 --> 00:05:59.557\njust pointing it to a file\nname isn't gonna work.\n\n116\n00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:01.303\nIn fact, if I finish this command,\n\n117\n00:06:01.303 --> 00:06:05.290\nit'll give me a nice little error\ntelling me that I can't use file name.\n\n118\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.090\nAnd so what I actually have to do,\nis bring the data in as byte data and\n\n119\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.303\nthat makes the syntax really bizarre.\n\n120\n00:06:11.303 --> 00:06:14.060\nI don't know why Microsoft did\nthis exactly, but they did and so\n\n121\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.110\nwe have to work around it, fortunately\nthis isn't something you do very often.\n\n122\n00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.603\nSo instead of using file name,\nI'm gonna use file data.\n\n123\n00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:25.041\nWhich is basically saying, open the file\nand read the data into this command byte\n\n124\n00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:28.390\nby byte, so that it gets it,\nand it's correct, all right?\n\n125\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.827\nSo I'll say file data, and I'm gonna\ntell it that I'm bringing in byte data,\n\n126\n00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:35.264\nI know this just gets awesome doesn't it?\n\n127\n00:06:35.264 --> 00:06:40.640\nAnd I'm gonna use $Get-Content to\nopen the contents of the file,\n\n128\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:47.170\nand the path to that file, and so for\nme it's C:/EdgeSub.xml is where I put it.\n\n129\n00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.501\nAnd then from there,\nI need to kinda close this off so\n\n130\n00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:57.950\nit understands that the encoding is byte,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.454\nI'm pulling in byte data and\nI only need to read it once, so\n\n132\n00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.410\nI'm gonna do a ReadCount of 0.\n\n133\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.331\nComputer's starting memory was 0, so that\nlike a ReadCount of 1 would be the true\n\n134\n00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:10.031\nthing there, and\nthen I'll close that off, all right?\n\n135\n00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:13.920\nAnd so that's gonna read that\nsubscription into my server okay?\n\n136\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.274\nThat's gonna go in there, create that\nsubscription, and get that in place, but\n\n137\n00:07:17.274 --> 00:07:20.109\nthere's a few other things that we\nneed to do at the same time, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:20.109 --> 00:07:25.480\nI want outside email to be able\nto come into my mailbox server.\n\n139\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.850\nSo I need to create a receive connector\nto be able to handle that, all right?\n\n140\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.234\nSo, I need to put in a tag\nhere to create that.\n\n141\n00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:34.300\nIf I don't, I'm gonna have to\nmanually create it later on, and\n\n142\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.695\nit's better to have it created right now.\n\n143\n00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:38.655\nSame thing for send,\nif I want my outbound email\n\n144\n00:07:38.655 --> 00:07:42.165\nto go through the Edge Transport server, I\nneed to create a send connector for that.\n\n145\n00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:44.305\nAnd so I can put that right here\nin my PowerShell command, and\n\n146\n00:07:44.305 --> 00:07:46.217\nit can create all that for me at once.\n\n147\n00:07:46.217 --> 00:07:49.568\nIt'll set up the receive and the send\nconnectors, and get them in place.\n\n148\n00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:52.232\nIt's definitely easier than doing it\nby hand, so I'm gonna do it right here.\n\n149\n00:07:52.232 --> 00:08:00.853\nSo I'm gonna say\n-CreateInternet There we go.\n\n150\n00:08:00.853 --> 00:08:02.500\nCreate Internet send connector.\n\n151\n00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.530\nAnd I'll set that value to true.\n\n152\n00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:12.340\nAnd then I'll do create\ninbound send connector,\n\n153\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.820\nand I'll set that one to true also.\n\n154\n00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.340\nOkay.\n\n155\n00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.710\nSo Internet for my email is going out, and\nmy inbound for email that's coming in.\n\n156\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.680\nNow, why is it called a send connector?\n\n157\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.230\nWell, that send connector's actually being\ncreated on the edge transport server\n\n158\n00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.120\nto send into us,\nthat's why it's a send connector.\n\n159\n00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.260\nSo, I just have to tell it\nthat I want to create that.\n\n160\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.030\nAnd then I need to tell it\nthe site that it's attached to.\n\n161\n00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.390\nNow, the site is\nthe Active Directory site, right?\n\n162\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.620\nIf you haven't looked at this,\nlet me jump over to my domain controller.\n\n163\n00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.630\nOn my domain controller if I go into\nTools and Active Directory sites and\n\n164\n00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.540\nservices, you can arrange your active\ndirectory based on geographic locations.\n\n165\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.070\nIf you haven't done it,\n\n166\n00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.720\nthen you only have one site called\nDefault First Site Name and that's it.\n\n167\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.950\nBut if you have done it then you'll see\nall your different geographical locations.\n\n168\n00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.810\nAnd if you expand that out,\nnotice my edge sync service right there.\n\n169\n00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.840\nYour edge transport\nservers are tied to sites.\n\n170\n00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.490\nSo when you have mailbox\nservers in a particular site\n\n171\n00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.650\nthey can have different edge\ntransport servers than other ones.\n\n172\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.460\nSo I can see it right here\ntied to this site and\n\n173\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.370\nthat's the one that I need\nto be loading this into.\n\n174\n00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.130\nSo back on my mailbox server.\n\n175\n00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:23.945\nI just need to say, dash site, and\nmine is just that default first site name.\n\n176\n00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:29.700\nAll right, so, that's basically what I\nneed, and, let me just do a quick syntax\n\n177\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.310\ncheck because there's a lot of places you\ncan make a mistake in a command like this.\n\n178\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.370\nSo, I'm just kind of counting my\nopen brackets and closed brackets.\n\n179\n00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.370\nAnd, actually, you know what,\nI do have a mistake don't I?\n\n180\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:42.860\nBecause I opened up byte with a square way\nback there at the beginning of the line,\n\n181\n00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.010\nand I didn't close that off.\n\n182\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.450\nSo just doing a quick scan for typos is\nalways a good idea to make sure that you\n\n183\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.910\ndon't get anything too crazy in there.\n\n184\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:55.170\nAnd my read count closes that out,\nso that should be good.\n\n185\n00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.780\nAll right.\nEasiest way to test is to run it.\n\n186\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.450\nSo this should import that subscription,\ncreate those connectors and communicate\n\n187\n00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.370\nwith the various mailbox servers that I\nmight have about this new subscription.\n\n188\n00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:11.150\nSo we'll run that and it looks like\nI did get an error on this one.\n\n189\n00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.850\nSo I must have a typo in here.\n\n190\n00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.260\nLet me just double check for a typo\nreal quick and see where my mistake is.\n\n191\n00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.220\nSo let me clean this up a bit and\nI'm going to take that file name and\n\n192\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.610\nthe path and put that in quotes.\n\n193\n00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.710\nA lot of times it does want that.\n\n194\n00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.210\nEven though I don't have any spaces\nin the file name, I'll add those.\n\n195\n00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:30.300\nYou know what, it looks like I am\nmissing a open parentheses right here.\n\n196\n00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.570\nGet contents, let me just correct that.\n\n197\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.400\nAnd that should work out\na little bit better for me.\n\n198\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.000\nThere we go.\nA lot of room to make a mistake on\n\n199\n00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.720\na command like that.\n\n200\n00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.770\nSo when I run that now it imports and\nthen I can see that I've got lab/edge01.\n\n201\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.810\nAnd it's pulling it into my site for\nthe itprotv.net.\n\n202\n00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.950\nIt's creating that edge subscription.\n\n203\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.000\nNow, my mail box servers have\nthe authentication key to be able to\n\n204\n00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.550\nreach out to that edge transport\nserver and push changes to it.\n\n205\n00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.620\nRight?\nWe can push hashed values of all of our\n\n206\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.580\nuser accounts up to it so\nit can know what email addresses we have,\n\n207\n00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.400\nand things like that.\n\n208\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.930\nWe can push all of the settings up\nto it and that's pretty important.\n\n209\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.620\nAlright?\n\n210\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.700\nNow that we've got that done, we wait.\n\n211\n00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.300\nRight?\nThe user sync alone can take up to four\n\n212\n00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.000\nhours if you let it go on its own.\n\n213\n00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.630\nWell I'm an impatient person so I'm gonna\nkind of kick this one in the butt and\n\n214\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.260\ntell it to replicate right now.\n\n215\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.530\nIf you wanna force it to replicate\n\n216\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.315\nyou can just run a real simple command\nhere which is start/edgesynchronization.\n\n217\n00:11:26.315 --> 00:11:29.070\nAll right that's gonna force\nit to replicate right now,\n\n218\n00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.060\nits gonna replicate the edge sync\nconfig as well as the user list.\n\n219\n00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.150\nAnd it's gonna push all\nthat along right now.\n\n220\n00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.690\nSo we can come in here and\nstart to see whether we've got any issues,\n\n221\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.960\nwhether we're communicating,\nand whether it's running.\n\n222\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.150\nI've got a message here.\n\n223\n00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.650\nI got a response that says could not\nconnect for the configuration replication.\n\n224\n00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:52.600\nSo I tried to reach out to lab edge 01 and\nit got LDAP server is unavailable so\n\n225\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.330\nI wasn't able to communicate out and\nget to that system.\n\n226\n00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.900\nAnd if I look right after that,\nhere's where it did the recipients,\n\n227\n00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.360\nthe other thing it replicates.\n\n228\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.150\nThe first one it replicates once every\nhour, the second one it replicates\n\n229\n00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.330\nonce every four hours, but I can see right\nhere, our LDAP server's unavailable.\n\n230\n00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.670\nAll right what does that mean?\n\n231\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.000\nWell, it means one of two things.\n\n232\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.840\nEither one, I couldn't do DNS resolution.\n\n233\n00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.920\nOr two, there's a firewall blocking me.\n\n234\n00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.530\nRight?\nWell let's see which one it is.\n\n235\n00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:21.980\nSo if I do a ping to\nlab-edge01.itprotv.net,\n\n236\n00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.750\nright, that's the fully\nqualified name of that server.\n\n237\n00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.640\nI can see I did resolve the IP so\nI don't have a DNS problem.\n\n238\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.840\nAnd I can ping it.\n\n239\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.990\nBut what does that mean?\n\n240\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.500\nWell, it means I can ping it.\n\n241\n00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.790\nThe other ports might be closed.\n\n242\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.330\nSo I need to check my firewall\non the Edge Transfer server.\n\n243\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.810\nNow when I installed the Edge Transfer\nServer, it's running the Windows firewall,\n\n244\n00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.940\nand so\nI'm probably just blocking the port and\n\n245\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:48.400\nif you remember the port that edge sync\nuses, is that five zero six three six, and\n\n246\n00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.760\nthen we've got the other ports for,\nlike, SMTP and stuff.\n\n247\n00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.970\nWe need to clear those away.\n\n248\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.480\nWe talked about those in the last episode.\n\n249\n00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.940\nSo if I jump over to my edge server,\nlet's just take a look and\n\n250\n00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.840\nsee if my firewall is even on.\n\n251\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.790\nNow, I'll be honest with you guys,\nnormally on an edge transport server\n\n252\n00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.610\nlike this, I'd turn the firewall off,\nand I have.\n\n253\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.450\nAnd the reason I turn it off,\nif you remember my diagram,\n\n254\n00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.850\nlet me bring that diagram back up.\n\n255\n00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.670\nWhere did I put that thing?\n\n256\n00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.550\nSee these physical firewalls?\n\n257\n00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.970\nAn edge transport server is almost always\nsitting in between physical firewalls\n\n258\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:16.530\nlike this and so\n\n259\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.640\nif we're relying on those we don't\nnecessarily need the Windows firewall.\n\n260\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.840\nUnless we're concerned about other servers\nin the DMZ getting compromised and\n\n261\n00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.930\npeople hopping over to it.\n\n262\n00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.150\nIn which case that Windows\nfirewall is pretty handy.\n\n263\n00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.210\nBut in my case I've got\nthe Windows firewall turned off.\n\n264\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.280\nSo, I'm having some kinda LDAP\nconnectivity problem here\n\n265\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.980\nbeyond what I would normally expect.\n\n266\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.270\nSo let me just double check my services\nand make sure the services are running.\n\n267\n00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.330\nAnd I'll jump in here and double check\nthat and we, you know in theory,\n\n268\n00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.390\nshould be good there.\n\n269\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.920\nYou can sort by start-up type to automatic\nand just kind of skim down the list.\n\n270\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.850\nNow the Active Directory\nLightweight Directory service is\n\n271\n00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.325\na few different things we need to look at.\n\n272\n00:13:56.325 --> 00:13:57.460\nThe key one is this guy right here.\n\n273\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.885\nThe Microsoft Exchange ADAM.\n\n274\n00:13:59.885 --> 00:14:02.480\nThat's Active Directory Application Mode.\n\n275\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.490\nWhen Active Directory Lightweight\nDirectory Services first came out,\n\n276\n00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.180\nit was actually called ADAM instead and so\n\n277\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.220\nwhen we find it here it's\nstill using the old name.\n\n278\n00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.560\nAnd I can see mines up and running and\nit looks to be healthy if nothing else,\n\n279\n00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.200\nand so\nwe don't seem to have any issues there.\n\n280\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.850\nAnd I'm just looking for\nany other services that might be stopped.\n\n281\n00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.170\nRemote registry is stopped,\nbut that's okay in this case.\n\n282\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.620\nI don't need that one.\n\n283\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.600\nAnd everything else\nappears to be fine too.\n\n284\n00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.870\nSo I'm not seeing any\nservices jumping out at me.\n\n285\n00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.060\nThe next place to check are event logs,\nright.\n\n286\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.129\nThe event logs will usually give\nus some information there and\n\n287\n00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:40.319\neven back in the Server Manager, we might\nsee some information right down here lower\n\n288\n00:14:40.319 --> 00:14:42.402\nin our Server Manager as we start to look.\n\n289\n00:14:42.402 --> 00:14:45.721\nAll right, so in our Server Manager,\nwe can look here to see some of the errors\n\n290\n00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:47.855\nthat might be being\ngenerated by our event logs.\n\n291\n00:14:47.855 --> 00:14:49.381\nA kind of quick way to\nspot some of this stuff.\n\n292\n00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:52.095\nI see I've got an MS Exchange\ntransport warning here,\n\n293\n00:14:52.095 --> 00:14:54.820\nwhich is not usually\nenough to stop things.\n\n294\n00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.560\nYeah its telling me anti spam\ncan't run because it doesn't have\n\n295\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.750\nSMTB connectors to find yet\nwhich is because sync is failing.\n\n296\n00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.820\nSo not anything to worry about there.\n\n297\n00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.940\nI'm gonna jump down to the LDS service or\nthe role and look at what I've got there.\n\n298\n00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.410\nYeah here I'm I'm starting\nto see some errors.\n\n299\n00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.540\nSo I've got an Active Directory\nlightweight error,\n\n300\n00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:15.350\nhere can't build an address book hierarchy\ntable, and then the MS exchange LDAP.\n\n301\n00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.530\nLet's see it needs to be,\nwants me to increase security for SASL,\n\n302\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.660\nit looks like the LDS didn't quite update.\n\n303\n00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.850\nSo let's do this.\n\n304\n00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.700\nI'm just gonna restart that service so\nif I go back into my services panel,\n\n305\n00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.450\nI'm gonna find that Microsoft Exchange\nADAM that I pointed out a few moments ago.\n\n306\n00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.490\nI'm just gonna restart that turkey.\n\n307\n00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.490\nSometimes when you do the install things\ncome up and they aren't quite configured\n\n308\n00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.870\nright, so we'll give it a little\nkick in the pants here.\n\n309\n00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.630\nAnd see how when I restart the ADM\nit's gonna restart all of these\n\n310\n00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:44.980\nother Exchange services and so\nthis is like doing a faster reboot.\n\n311\n00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.040\nIt's just gonna reboot\nthe Exchange system.\n\n312\n00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.990\nAnd then we'll try and\nsync that subscription again.\n\n313\n00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.154\nSo as soon as that's done, let's see,\noh, it wasn't able to stop that one.\n\n314\n00:15:54.154 --> 00:15:58.534\nI'm gonna have to, sometimes some services\ntake a little longer to stop than others,\n\n315\n00:15:58.534 --> 00:16:01.894\nand so it failed to actually get to\nwhere it could restart the ADAM.\n\n316\n00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:03.869\nI'm gonna stop it.\n\n317\n00:16:03.869 --> 00:16:04.889\nLike that.\n\n318\n00:16:04.889 --> 00:16:07.792\nAnd that will stop it outright, and\nthis time it's just 68 and stop.\n\n319\n00:16:07.792 --> 00:16:08.530\nThere we go.\n\n320\n00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.550\nAnd then what you can do,\nis you can go back through and\n\n321\n00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.160\nyou can kind of restart them.\n\n322\n00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.710\nAnd sorting by the automatic start up type\nis really convenient here because you can\n\n323\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.600\nquickly spot the ones that\nneed to be started back up.\n\n324\n00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.280\nSo.\n\n325\n00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.610\nFor the Exchange services,\nI can quickly see the six that stopped and\n\n326\n00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.820\nwe can get those restarted.\n\n327\n00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.760\nAlthough at this stage,\n\n328\n00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.840\nit probably would have been\nfaster just to reboot the server.\n\n329\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.330\nBut we'll do it this way for thoroughness.\n\n330\n00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.200\nI'm gonna restart each of these services.\n\n331\n00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.550\nAnd once that's done, we'll jump over and\ntry that subscription again.\n\n332\n00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.770\nSo we'll just get these put back and\nthen we'll be in business.\n\n333\n00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.530\nI did see a couple other services that\nwere running, I'm pretty sure those were\n\n334\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.050\nnot related to Exchange, so\nI'm not too worried about them.\n\n335\n00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.830\nThings like Windows remote registry,\nyou expect that one to be disabled,\n\n336\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.160\nWindows Update, yeah, software protection.\n\n337\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.150\nThese are the ones that fire in when it's\nscanning, when it's doing things, so\n\n338\n00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.920\nI'm not worried about those.\n\n339\n00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.830\nAll right, but now that we got\nthe restart, let's jump back over here and\n\n340\n00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.520\nI'm just gonna retry that subscription.\n\n341\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.030\nSo I'm gonna do Start-Edge Synchronization\nand I'll run that.\n\n342\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.910\nAnd, oh, there we go, there we go.\n\n343\n00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.910\nAll right, so, this time I got\nResult Success, Type Configuration.\n\n344\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.700\nAnd up here, I should have the same thing\nfor the recipients, Yeah, there we go.\n\n345\n00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.520\nNow we're moving.\n\n346\n00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.870\nSo, sometimes you just have to give\nit a little kick in the pants there.\n\n347\n00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.900\nBut you guys kinda saw\nthe troubleshooting process there.\n\n348\n00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.290\nStart with DNS,\ncuz that's almost always the problem.\n\n349\n00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.200\nThen firewalls to make\nsure we have connectivity.\n\n350\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.450\nAnd then after that,\nstart looking through your event logs.\n\n351\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.150\nYou'll usually find something.\n\n352\n00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.780\nI restarted that ADAM and\nthat seemed to take care of it.\n\n353\n00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.830\nThere is another command.\n\n354\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:33.310\nI don't find it incredibly useful,\nbut what you can do is,\n\n355\n00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.715\nI'll show you anyway cuz it's there and\nit might show up on the exam.\n\n356\n00:17:35.715 --> 00:17:38.320\nTest-EdgeSynchronization.\n\n357\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.540\nIt's another command that\nwe can run that'll go and\n\n358\n00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.660\ngive you some basic\ninformation about the system.\n\n359\n00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.160\nNow the reason I say it's not\nterribly useful here is so\n\n360\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.770\nmy server's not set up yet.\n\n361\n00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.640\nSo, what testing the edge\nsubscription does, is it, or\n\n362\n00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.560\nedge synchronization, is it looks to see\nif we can see the server, and then it\n\n363\n00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.745\ngives you information about the status of\nall the things we've configured on it.\n\n364\n00:17:56.745 --> 00:17:58.240\nBut we haven't configured anything yet.\n\n365\n00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.010\nSo that's why I didn't go to that command.\n\n366\n00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.190\nThis is more useful down the road, like\nlater one when we've configured things we\n\n367\n00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.370\ncan check the status of all\nthe services and so on.\n\n368\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.320\nBefore right now I don't\nusually use that one.\n\n369\n00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.300\nBut just be aware that is a test dash\nedge synchronization command you can run.\n\n370\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.790\nAll right, well,\n\n371\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.160\nthis point, my subscription has been\nbrought into my internal server.\n\n372\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.440\nI'm talking to the external server so\nI'm pushing changes to it.\n\n373\n00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.810\nI should be ready to rock.\n\n374\n00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.030\nLet's verify one more thing though.\n\n375\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:28.120\nI'm gonna jump over to my Exchange admin\ncenter, and in my Exchange admin center.\n\n376\n00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.120\nI should see some new receive\nconnectors that are set up.\n\n377\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.320\nSo if I go down here to mail flow and\n\n378\n00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:38.160\nI take a look at my receive connectors,\nwhen I look at the receive connectors\n\n379\n00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.370\nI've got my basic settings\nin place like normal, right?\n\n380\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.980\nNothing too special there, but\n\n381\n00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.010\non the send connector side, now I see\nthose EdgeSync connections, right?\n\n382\n00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.450\nHere's the EdgeSync.\n\n383\n00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.950\nDefault first site name to internet.\n\n384\n00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.970\nRight, so this is our outgoing stuff.\n\n385\n00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.910\nAnd then we got inbound to\ndefault first site name.\n\n386\n00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.750\nThese are the send connectors that were\ncreated that actually connect our site\n\n387\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.020\nto the edge transport service.\n\n388\n00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.700\nSo those are in place, and they're up\nin running, they're doing their job.\n\n389\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.470\nWe can always come in and edit them and\ntweak their settings, change things if you\n\n390\n00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:09.300\nwant to but for the most part it's\nset the way that we need them.\n\n391\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.190\nAt this stage, we've got an edge\ntransport server and we're now up and\n\n392\n00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.250\nrunning and\nit's doing what it needs to do.\n\n393\n00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.420\nNow what is it doing?\n\n394\n00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.136\nNot really much.\n\n395\n00:19:18.136 --> 00:19:21.070\n[LAUGH] Right now it's\njust relaying email.\n\n396\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.990\nSo right now it's giving you security just\nthrough obscuring your email address list\n\n397\n00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.410\nand that's it, right.\n\n398\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.840\nBut where the real power of the Edge\nTransport server comes in is when we go\n\n399\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.830\nand configure the advanced things.\n\n400\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.800\nOn the Edge Transport server,\nwe can filter out spam,\n\n401\n00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.170\nwe can filter out viruses.\n\n402\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.060\nYou can put policies in place that\nwhite-list and blacklist IPs.\n\n403\n00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.750\nYou can do all sorts of security\nmeasures like that, and\n\n404\n00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.410\nit will filter email before it\neven gets into your organization.\n\n405\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.380\nAnd that's where the real power is.\n\n406\n00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:53.330\nSo what we need to do next is to actually\nget in there and set up those rules.\n\n407\n00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.750\nBut that would be something\ngreat to cover in part three,\n\n408\n00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.560\nright, in our next episode when we\nstart to get into actually configuring\n\n409\n00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.620\nall the rules and filtering for\nthe Exchange Edge Transport server.\n\n410\n00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.320\nSo definitely stay tuned for\nthat one but for this episode,\n\n411\n00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.930\nour Edge Transport server's up,\nit's running, it's happy.\n\n412\n00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.160\nThings are running the way\nthey're supposed to run,\n\n413\n00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.090\nnow we just need to configure it.\n\n414\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.950\nSo we'll definitely want\nto tune back in for that.\n\n415\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.320\nBut in this episode we got a chance to\nsee setting up that Edge subscription,\n\n416\n00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.530\ndoing the Edge synchronization, and\ntesting it and troubleshooting it\n\n417\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.270\nto actually make sure it's up and running\nand doing what it's supposed to do.\n\n418\n00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.210\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the episode!\n\n419\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.610\nDefinitely tune back in for configuring\nthe rules and filtering on this server,\n\n420\n00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:32.990\ncuz that's where it really becomes useful.\n\n421\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.880\nAnd it'll definitely be\na good one to watch.\n\n422\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.920\nI hope to see you then.\n\n423\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.345\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet, and I'll see you next time.\n\n424\n00:20:40.345 -->

00:00:15.240\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.190\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.570\nBack again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.690\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\ncontinue our Edge server adventure,\n\n7\n00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.870\nas we jump in and\nactually get some rules configured.\n\n8\n00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.490\nIf you've been watching\nour previous episodes,\n\n9\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.315\nwe saw how to install an Edge transport\nserver, we saw how to set up Edge sync and\n\n10\n00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:36.990\nan Edge subscription, and\nwe've got all that in place.\n\n11\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.610\nAnd we have an Edge Transport server up,\nbut we didn't really make it do anything.\n\n12\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.720\nAnything other than just receiving and\nsending email which is fine,\n\n13\n00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.400\nbut there's so much more we can\ndo with an Edge Transport server.\n\n14\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.850\nAn Edge Transport server is designed\nto provide like the ultimate\n\n15\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.490\nplace to implement security\non your email network.\n\n16\n00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.290\nSo if you're scanning for viruses,\nif you're scanning for spam and\n\n17\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.660\nthings like that, by catching\nit on the edge transport server,\n\n18\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.430\nyou stop it from ever getting\ninside your private network.\n\n19\n00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.310\nAnd that gives you a great\nlevel of security and\n\n20\n00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.470\nprotection and really is kind of the whole\npoint of the edge transport server.\n\n21\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.400\nIf you're just using it\nas like an SMTP relay,\n\n22\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.230\nan Edge transport server\nis kind of overkill.\n\n23\n00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.890\nYou can probably use your ISP\nto provide that service, and\n\n24\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.920\nnow it's one less system to maintain.\n\n25\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.820\nBut if you really want the power, that's\nwhere an Edge transport server comes in.\n\n26\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.850\nAnd the way we get that power is\nby configuring what are called\n\n27\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.610\ntransport rules.\n\n28\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.200\nNow, we've seen transport rules in\nother episodes where we set up,\n\n29\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.950\non a mailbox server we created some\ntransport rules to add things like\n\n30\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.350\na legal disclaimer or whatever.\n\n31\n00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.560\nAnd you can do that.\n\n32\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.320\nBut on an edge transport server,\n\n33\n00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.440\nthe transport rules are really\nfocused on security.\n\n34\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.270\nAnd so to do that, there's these transport\nagents that run in the background and\n\n35\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.100\nthey let us perform all\nsorts of crazy actions.\n\n36\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.880\nLet me show you how they work\non an edge transport server.\n\n37\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.470\nSo here I am on my edge\ntransport server and\n\n38\n00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.790\nI'm just gonna jump into my\nexchange management shelf.\n\n39\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.680\nAnd there's a neat little command you can\nrun, which is just Get-TransportAgent,\n\n40\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.535\nwhich I'll get to eventually, there we go.\n\n41\n00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:08.170\nGet-TransportAgent, and it'll show you all\nthe different agents that are installed\n\n42\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.830\nand enabled on an Edge Transport server.\n\n43\n00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.600\nOn a mailbox server, some of these\nare enabled, a lot of them are disabled.\n\n44\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.060\nOn an Edge Transport server,\nthey're all turned on, and\n\n45\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.920\nthat's because Microsoft assumes\nyou're going to be doing these things.\n\n46\n00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.570\nAnd if you look at what's available,\n\n47\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.840\nyou've got things like\nconnection filtering agent.\n\n48\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.400\nYou might not want to allow certain\nemail servers to connect at all.\n\n49\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.360\nRight?\nThere might be a email server out there\n\n50\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.500\nthat you know is a spam relay and\nyou just wanna block that server outright.\n\n51\n00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.760\nSo you can create a connection filter,\n\n52\n00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.980\nthat says, don't even, don't even ask\nthat server for a username and password.\n\n53\n00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.800\nDon't, don't ask it anything,\njust don't even let that IP connect.\n\n54\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.270\nYou might wanna do address rewriting,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.520\nThe address rewriting inbound agent and\naddress rewriting outbound agent.\n\n56\n00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.960\nYou can take an email and you can take\nthe sender or recipient address and\n\n57\n00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.070\nchange it to something else.\n\n58\n00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.680\nRight?\nFor\n\n59\n00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.145\nexample, I might have a distribution\nlist inside of my network that's called\n\n60\n00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:01.580\nsalespeople@itprotv.net.\n\n61\n00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.060\nBut on the outside,\nI want it to be info at ITPro.TV.\n\n62\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.200\nWell, I can take email coming in for\ninfo at ITPro.TV and\n\n63\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.440\nrewrite that destination to sales\nat whatever and send it internally.\n\n64\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.390\nSo you can do rewrites as\nthe emails pass through,\n\n65\n00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.029\nit's a great way to obscure addresses.\n\n66\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.480\nThen we see things like\nour edge rule agent.\n\n67\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.010\nThat's going to be what makes all these\nrules apply and what's going to be\n\n68\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.280\npulling the rules from inside if we're\npushing these from an internal server.\n\n69\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.700\nThen we'll see our content filter.\n\n70\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.970\nThe content filter agent is kind of fun,\nwell as fun as these things get.\n\n71\n00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.670\nIt lets you look for key words and\nphrases inside emails and take actions.\n\n72\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.180\nAnd that action could be to block it, but\n\n73\n00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.520\nit's normally to apply a [COUGH]\nspam confidence level, an SCL.\n\n74\n00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.900\nSo you can assign an SCL based\non content in the email.\n\n75\n00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.420\nYou can look for\nwords like Rolex or Viagra.\n\n76\n00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.140\nYou can look for\nwords like Unsubscribe or phrases.\n\n77\n00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.120\nIf you're having trouble\nreading this email.\n\n78\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.780\nThat's not stuff a normal person would use\nso you could look for those phrases and\n\n79\n00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.480\nadjust the SCL appropriately\nusing the content filter.\n\n80\n00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.180\nThe sender ID agent, all right.\n\n81\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.340\nWhen somebody sends an email, they say\nwhat their email address is, right?\n\n82\n00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.300\nThe from field.\n\n83\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.320\nSo you might get an email from me and\nit's says it's from Don@itpro.tv.\n\n84\n00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.180\nWell, your server can go and\ndo a lookup and say, all right,\n\n85\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.920\nI'm gonna go find the itpro.tv domain, and\nI'm gonna look for an SPF record, right.\n\n86\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.470\nThat's the sender policy framework and\nit's gonna look to see\n\n87\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.240\nwhat email servers are allowed to\nsend email for ITPro.TV, right.\n\n88\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.466\nAnd if you're getting my email from one\nof those servers then it's probably good.\n\n89\n00:04:33.466 --> 00:04:35.460\nBut if you're getting that\nemail from a different server,\n\n90\n00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.150\na server that's not on the list,\nI probably wanna block that.\n\n91\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.040\nIt's probably spam.\n\n92\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.270\nAnd that's what sender ID filtering is and\nthe sender ID agent is what checks that.\n\n93\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.180\nNow with it, it's on by default.\n\n94\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.940\nWe might wanna turn it off, but otherwise\nwe'd usually just leave that one alone.\n\n95\n00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.210\nThere's not a whole heck\nof a lot to do on that one.\n\n96\n00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.780\nAll right then we've got these sender\nfilter and the recipient filter agent.\n\n97\n00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.250\nYou might want to whitelist or\nblacklist individual users.\n\n98\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.400\nYou might have an e-mail that's\nconstantly sending you spam and\n\n99\n00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.170\nyou can't unsubscribe from it, so\n\n100\n00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.190\nyou could block that right at the edge of\ntransport server, and it never comes in.\n\n101\n00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.250\nThe protocol analysis agent.\n\n102\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.120\nWe can look into the protocol itself and\nsee if, if it's like SMTP\n\n103\n00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.230\nemails that are coming in with certain\nheader types that aren't allowed or\n\n104\n00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.650\ncertain header types that are malformed.\n\n105\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.190\nAnd then you've got\nthe attachment filtering.\n\n106\n00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.250\nAttachment filtering's where, well,\nyou look at the attachment and\n\n107\n00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.980\nyou can filter based on the extension,\nbased on the size.\n\n108\n00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.870\nThere's all sorts of different things that\nyou can filter on to allow or denying it.\n\n109\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.750\nSo, a lot of different stuff there that\nyou can pull and actually deal with.\n\n110\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.040\nSo, these are all the agents that\nare running in the background.\n\n111\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.040\nSome of them we'll work with,\nsome of them we won't.\n\n112\n00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.260\nYou kinda pick and\nchoose based on your environment.\n\n113\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.470\nBut in this episode I wanted to show you\nguys a couple of real world examples of\n\n114\n00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.830\nhow you might use these rules, all right.\n\n115\n00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.410\nNow, each agent has a different\ncommand that we use to go in and\n\n116\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.090\nkind of set things.\n\n117\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.680\nWe have some PowerShell\ncommandlets that we have to use.\n\n118\n00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.460\nUnfortunately there's no GUI for this.\n\n119\n00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.740\nWe can't use the GUI to manage our Edge\nTransport Server so we've got to do it\n\n120\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.960\nfrom our management shell and\njust dive in there and start to set these.\n\n121\n00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.010\nSo let me show you some examples.\n\n122\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.430\nAll right, first off, let's say that you\nuse one of those real time block lists,\n\n123\n00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.440\nright, an RBL.\n\n124\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.550\nThere's a lot of companies out there like\nSpamhaus that maintain email blocklists\n\n125\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.270\nwhere they list all the servers out there\nthat have been identified as sending spam.\n\n126\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.350\nSo you can set your server to\nreject connections from them,\n\n127\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.730\nI might wanna turn that on.\n\n128\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.364\nSo, using Spamhaus as an example,\nif I wanna set that up,\n\n129\n00:06:29.364 --> 00:06:34.012\nthe command to do it would\nbe Add-IPBlockListProvider.\n\n130\n00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:39.829\nAll right, so this is the command that's\ngonna be reaching into the connection\n\n131\n00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:41.040\nfiltering agent.\n\n132\n00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.690\nAnd I'm gonna be adding\nsome new block list.\n\n133\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.820\nI need to give it a name.\n\n134\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.120\nAnd I'll just call mine Spamhaus,\nall right.\n\n135\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.180\nAnd then I need to give\nit a look up domain.\n\n136\n00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.920\nThe way that spam block list work is when\nyou get an email from a particular domain,\n\n137\n00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.430\nyou can take that domain and\nsend it to a DNS server that's out there.\n\n138\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.550\nAnd the way we find that DNS server\nis by specifying the lookup domain.\n\n139\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.188\nAnd the one that Spamhaus\nuses is zen.spamhaus.org and\n\n140\n00:07:08.188 --> 00:07:12.250\nthen we can specify what\nto do about these things.\n\n141\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.190\nSo I'll say, any match, dollar sign, true.\n\n142\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.600\nThe way it works is if you do\na DNS lookup for a domain and\n\n143\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.130\nit doesn't get an answer back,\nthen it's not on the blacklist, it's okay.\n\n144\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.410\nBut if you get any kind of response back\nthen that means it's on the block list and\n\n145\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.070\nwe can take action.\n\n146\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.700\nSo I'm saying if I get any match and\nI'll try and spell it right.\n\n147\n00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.190\nIf any match happens,\nthen I want to treat it as a spam relay,\n\n148\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.900\nsomebody I don't want\nto receive email from.\n\n149\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.980\nAnd then we can just say\nthat this is enabled.\n\n150\n00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.820\nSo, I'll set enabled to true cuz\nyou can disable this temporarily if\n\n151\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.650\nyou're trying to troubleshoot.\n\n152\n00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.420\nAnd then we do other\nrejection options here.\n\n153\n00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.500\nSo, I'll say reject response so\nthat I can send a custom error message.\n\n154\n00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.630\nOtherwise you're just gonna get one of\nthose five point one messages that's not\n\n155\n00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.423\nreally informative So\nI'm gonna give him a message and\n\n156\n00:07:57.423 --> 00:08:01.580\nI'll just say something like server\nrejected by email blacklist.\n\n157\n00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.620\nAnd that way, if somebody on the other end\nis trying to send me email they're getting\n\n158\n00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.970\nrejected, they can see why.\n\n159\n00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.220\nLike oh, apparently I got on a blacklist,\nI need to take care of that.\n\n160\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.440\nAnd when we run that, assuming I\ndon't have typos, looks like I do.\n\n161\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.220\nLet's see, add,\n\n162\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.880\na parameter cannot be found that\nmatches parameter name reject response.\n\n163\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.980\nSo, let me see.\n\n164\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.330\nOh, it's not reject,\nit's rejection response.\n\n165\n00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.670\nSo let me just update that and\nthere we go.\n\n166\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.390\nNow I have a real time block list.\n\n167\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.800\nAnd you'll see it's got a priority of one,\nI can go in and\n\n168\n00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.770\nstart adding more if I have\nother block lists I wanna add\n\n169\n00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.330\nyou can go crazy with it,\nyou don't want to go too crazy.\n\n170\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.900\nBut now any time a server connects, I'm\ngonna run them against the blacklist, and\n\n171\n00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.030\nif they're in the blacklist,\nI'll just reject their email, right?\n\n172\n00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:48.030\nSo pretty easy to jump that one right\nin there and get that taken care of.\n\n173\n00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.040\nAnother example is I might wanna\nsetup a spam quarantine, right?\n\n174\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.520\nWhat happens to email when the spam\ncompetence level is too high?\n\n175\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.290\nWell by default it goes in\nyour end user's junk mail.\n\n176\n00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.680\nWhat if you wanna intercept\nthat ahead of time and\n\n177\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.050\nsay don't put it in their junk mail?\n\n178\n00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.220\nLet's create a quarantine and set it\naside so the end users don't even see it.\n\n179\n00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.530\nAnd then if they wanna look for\n\n180\n00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.630\nsomething in spam they can just\nreach out to the help desk.\n\n181\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.500\nWell we can create a spam\nquarantine that does that.\n\n182\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.140\nAnd the Edge Transport Server\nis where we want to apply that.\n\n183\n00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.150\nSo the way we do that is with\nour content filtering agent.\n\n184\n00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:23.326\nSo I'm gonna say Set-ContentFilterConfig,\n-, and I'm gonna set a QuarantineMailbox.\n\n185\n00:09:23.326 --> 00:09:26.160\nNow, the quarantine mailbox,\nI need to give it an email address for\n\n186\n00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.710\na mailbox inside of my system, so\n\n187\n00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:32.120\nI might create something like\nspam@itprotv.net or something like that.\n\n188\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.340\nThis is gonna be the mailbox I'm\ngonna redirect these emails to.\n\n189\n00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.270\nAll right?\n\n190\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:43.480\nThen I can say the SCL quarantine enabled,\nthere.\n\n191\n00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.865\nSo I'm actually gonna\nturn the quarantine on.\n\n192\n00:09:44.865 --> 00:09:46.520\nCuz quarantine's off by default.\n\n193\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.700\nIt does actually make it to the end-users.\n\n194\n00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.675\nSo I'll do a $ true on that one.\n\n195\n00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:55.765\nAnd then I need to set\nthe SCL quarantine threshold.\n\n196\n00:09:55.765 --> 00:09:59.795\nAnd the threshold is the lowest\nSCL value that I actually used to\n\n197\n00:09:59.795 --> 00:10:00.615\nmove things to a quarantine.\n\n198\n00:10:00.615 --> 00:10:03.205\nI'm gonna set mine to six,\nwhich is probably a little aggressive.\n\n199\n00:10:03.205 --> 00:10:05.000\nYou might wanna choose something higher.\n\n200\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.320\nBut I'll choose six.\n\n201\n00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.270\nAnything that gets an SCL of six or\n\n202\n00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.790\nhigher, send to the quarantine\ninstead of the intended user.\n\n203\n00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.013\nSo, that's going to run and\nit's going to put in place.\n\n204\n00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:16.420\nAnd here it shows me no\nsettings have been modified.\n\n205\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.220\nSo apparently, I've already set it or\nit must already be at six.\n\n206\n00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.760\nBut if you were at something lower or\nhigher, then it's going to adjust it down.\n\n207\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.420\nLet's see, what other things might we do?\n\n208\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.290\nWell, that content filter.\n\n209\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.320\nMaybe there's certain keywords that\nI want to filter on like unsubscribe.\n\n210\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.750\nWell I could add a keyword filter.\n\n211\n00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.394\nI could say Add-ContentFilterPhrase.\n\n212\n00:10:39.394 --> 00:10:42.820\nAnd then I can specify the phrase\nthat I want to filter on.\n\n213\n00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.110\nAnd this is where you can\ndo all sorts of things.\n\n214\n00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.660\nI'll say look for unsubscribe.\n\n215\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.550\nBut you could be looking for other things,\n\n216\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.060\nwhoops, which if I spell\nit right will work better.\n\n217\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.700\nBut you could do phrases.\n\n218\n00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.000\nIf you're having trouble reading this\nemail, that's one of my favorites.\n\n219\n00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.750\nThose are different things\nthat you can key off of.\n\n220\n00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:03.310\nAnd then from there, we basically specify\nwhat we need to do with it, right?\n\n221\n00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:08.330\nAnd a lot of times what we wanna do\nwith it is simply Influence the SCL.\n\n222\n00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.966\nAnd the way we influence the SCL is by\nsaying whether this is a good word or\n\n223\n00:11:11.966 --> 00:11:14.950\na bad word, so\nthere's only two influences that we have.\n\n224\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:19.054\nYou can say good word if this is something\nthat should improve your SCL and\n\n225\n00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:20.000\nmake it better.\n\n226\n00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.329\nOr you can say if it's a bad word\nwhich is something that will\n\n227\n00:11:24.329 --> 00:11:27.800\nincrease your SCL number\nwhich makes it worse.\n\n228\n00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.970\nSo, an SCL of zero is great.\n\n229\n00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.470\nIt's not spam, it's gonna get through.\n\n230\n00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.240\nAn SCL of nine is really bad.\n\n231\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.500\nIt is spam, right.\n\n232\n00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.450\nSo by saying bad word,\nwe make that number a little bit higher.\n\n233\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.640\nAnd for each bad word that it hits,\nit's making it worse and worse and\n\n234\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.680\nworse until it finally gets\nthat SCL rating of nine.\n\n235\n00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.290\nAll right, so we'll set that,\nand I just set that influence for\n\n236\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.130\nthe phrase unsubscribe.\n\n237\n00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.740\nAnd you can continue to add\nmore phrases as you want.\n\n238\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.430\nAnd you can do just a get dash content\nfolder phrase to see the whole list of\n\n239\n00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.730\nwhat you filtered.\n\n240\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.810\nWe might also have,\n\n241\n00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:03.070\nlet's say there's a business partner\nout there that we deal with.\n\n242\n00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.720\nWe don't want to spam filter them at all.\n\n243\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.870\nWe want to get all the email from them,\nor the opposite.\n\n244\n00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.763\nWe have a server that we\nabsolutely want to block and\n\n245\n00:12:08.763 --> 00:12:10.180\nwe don't want to get email from them.\n\n246\n00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.590\nYou can set IP white list and black list.\n\n247\n00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.220\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n248\n00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:23.240\nThe way we do that is by saying\nAdd-IPAllowListEntry-IPAddress\n\n249\n00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.290\nfollowed by the address of\nthe server we're gonna allow.\n\n250\n00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.740\nSo let's say that there's\na server at 1.1.1,\n\n251\n00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:32.740\nI can add that and now any email that I\nget from that server is gonna be allowed.\n\n252\n00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.730\nIt's gonna bypass the spam filter.\n\n253\n00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.380\nWe won't apply an SCL or\nanything like that and\n\n254\n00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.800\nit's gonna come in through the system.\n\n255\n00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.085\nI just white listed that server.\n\n256\n00:12:39.085 --> 00:12:42.719\nAnd you can block list it the same\nway instead of doing an IPAllowList,\n\n257\n00:12:42.719 --> 00:12:46.240\nwe could come in and say,\nmaybe there's a server 2.2.2.2.\n\n258\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.370\nAnd I don't want to allow that one.\n\n259\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.350\nI want to block it.\n\n260\n00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.580\nSo I just change that\nword from allow to block.\n\n261\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.520\nNow, 2.2.2.2 is on my block list.\n\n262\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.130\nAnytime the server at 2.2.2 tries\nto connect, I don't ask it for\n\n263\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.010\na username and password.\n\n264\n00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:01.820\nI don't ask it for anything.\n\n265\n00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.790\nI just immediately disconnect it and\nthat's it.\n\n266\n00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.220\nI won't allow them to\nconnect to my SMTP server.\n\n267\n00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.020\nAll right, so\nthere's a couple of entries there.\n\n268\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.370\nLet's see, what else do we have?\n\n269\n00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:18.620\nOh, so here I was whitelisting and\nblacklisting entire servers.\n\n270\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.140\nMaybe it's not an entire\nserver that I want.\n\n271\n00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.600\nMaybe it's an individual user or a domain.\n\n272\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.560\nI wanna whitelist this domain or\nI wanna whitelist this user.\n\n273\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.970\nSo there's a few ways we can do that.\n\n274\n00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.414\nYou can say Set-ContentFilterConfig and\n\n275\n00:13:32.414 --> 00:13:38.586\nwe can say -BypassSenders and\nwhat this is gonna do is allow\n\n276\n00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:43.780\nus to add email addresses\nto the spam bypass list.\n\n277\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.750\nSo I might say,\nboy I always want to get email from\n\n278\n00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:54.340\nDon@itpro.tv if I can\nremember my on email address.\n\n279\n00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.017\nAnd if I have more than one, you just\nstick quote marks around it and then add\n\n280\n00:13:59.017 --> 00:14:03.810\ncommas between each one, so you can add\nmore than one address if you wanted.\n\n281\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.280\nSo I'm gonna add Don@itpro.tv and\nwhat did you get upset about here?\n\n282\n00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.420\nDoesn't match bypass senders.\n\n283\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.420\nOh, it's bypassed.\n\n284\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.110\nI have to add it.\n\n285\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.180\nIt's kinda past tense there.\n\n286\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.980\nSo bypassed senders.\n\n287\n00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.880\nThere we go.\n\n288\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.180\nAnd now I can add that to the list.\n\n289\n00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.380\nSo, now, any time an email comes in and\n\n290\n00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:27.610\nit shows as being sent by Don@itpro.tv,\nit's gonna bypass the spam list.\n\n291\n00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:32.090\nI can do the same thing for\nBypassedSenderDomains.\n\n292\n00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.014\nAnd then I could add in itpro.tv.\n\n293\n00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.380\nAnd then anytime I get an email that\nsays its from somebody at itpro.tv,\n\n294\n00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.620\nit'll bypass the spam list and\nthat'll get through.\n\n295\n00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.820\nSo that's another great way to\nbe able to kind of bypass that.\n\n296\n00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.530\nA couple of questions in the chat room.\n\n297\n00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.919\nOne was, can we do the same thing on\nthe mail server, and the answer is yes.\n\n298\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.460\nOn the mailbox server,\nthese aren't turned on by default.\n\n299\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.080\nWell not all of them.\n\n300\n00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.090\nSome of them are, but most of them aren't\nturned on by default because Microsoft\n\n301\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.960\nassumes you're doing that at your Edge.\n\n302\n00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.935\nThey assume you've got\nan Edge transport server or\n\n303\n00:15:05.935 --> 00:15:10.410\nthat you've got some third party system\nlike a Barracuda virus and spam firewall.\n\n304\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.760\nIf you've got one of those,\n\n305\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.470\nyou don't need to do the filtering\nhere on a mailbox server.\n\n306\n00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.170\nBut you can jump over to mailbox server,\ndo these same commands.\n\n307\n00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.590\nAnything that runs the transport service,\nwhich are mailbox servers and\n\n308\n00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.280\nEdge transport servers,\nthey can all do that.\n\n309\n00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.340\nSo you can configure it there.\n\n310\n00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.386\nThe other question in the chat room was\nare these Exchange Powershell commands,\n\n311\n00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:29.070\nand that's yes.\n\n312\n00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.360\nIf you just run the regular Powershell\nyou're not going to have this.\n\n313\n00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.860\nYou have to have\nthe Exchange Powershell modules loaded.\n\n314\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.550\nSo when you install Exchange,\n\n315\n00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.860\nit actually adds that\nExchange Management Shell right there.\n\n316\n00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.960\nSo we need that to be able\nto see these commands.\n\n317\n00:15:43.787 --> 00:15:47.958\nAll right so, that was white listing\na server, white listing a user,\n\n318\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.950\nwhite listing a domain, right?\n\n319\n00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.710\nCouple of different ways to set\nthat up as bypassed senders, okay?\n\n320\n00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.380\nYou can do bypassed recipients also,\nit's really the same command.\n\n321\n00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.261\nYou just say bypassed recipients, and\n\n322\n00:15:58.261 --> 00:16:00.830\nnow it is based on who is\nreceiving the email, right?\n\n323\n00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:06.113\nThis is the from field,\nrecipients will be the to field.\n\n324\n00:16:06.113 --> 00:16:06.776\nAll right, but\n\n325\n00:16:06.776 --> 00:16:09.736\notherwise those are the same basic\nsyntax there to white list those.\n\n326\n00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:13.364\nNow when you specify all these settings,\nyou can get them put in place,\n\n327\n00:16:13.364 --> 00:16:17.659\nyou get them loaded up, and now your Edge\ntransport server is filtering this content\n\n328\n00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:20.410\nbefore it ever makes it\ninside your network.\n\n329\n00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.020\nIt's really kinda that perfect solution.\n\n330\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.800\nSo this is what we really need\nto do to get the server working\n\n331\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.580\nthe way that we want.\n\n332\n00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.820\nSo just be familiar with these.\n\n333\n00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.950\nThere's a lot of different commands, and\n\n334\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.410\nI'll put all the commands in the show\nnotes so you guys can have them.\n\n335\n00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.940\nBut there's a lot of different\ncommands that are out there.\n\n336\n00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.930\nYou kinda have to pick and choose what's\nright for your environment to get it set\n\n337\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.150\nup the way that you want and\nget it configured properly.\n\n338\n00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.070\nNow, let's talk about something\nthat I haven't mentioned so far.\n\n339\n00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.330\nWhen you have an Edge transport server,\nit's suppose to be the entry point to get\n\n340\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.640\ninto your network and it can be the exit\npoint also if you want it to be.\n\n341\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.440\nBut it's the one that's\nexposed to the internet.\n\n342\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.710\nSo, when somebodies sending an email\nin your organization it passes through\n\n343\n00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.690\nthe Edge transport server first and\nthen it goes inside.\n\n344\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.190\nAnd that's why the Edge transport server\nis suck a great place to put these rules.\n\n345\n00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:06.522\nCuz you might have 50 mailbox servers, but\nyou've got this one Edge transport server,\n\n346\n00:17:06.522 --> 00:17:09.668\nthis one point of entry,\nwhere you can filter people's access.\n\n347\n00:17:09.668 --> 00:17:14.530\nSo that really works out well,\nunless the Edge transport server fails.\n\n348\n00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.600\nWhat happens if the Edge\ntransport server fails?\n\n349\n00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.710\nNow email can't get in or\nout of your organization right?\n\n350\n00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.930\nSo we need high availability for\nEdge transport servers.\n\n351\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.700\nWell fortunately, Edge transport\nservers don't really store any data.\n\n352\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.230\nSo there's not much to back up or\nreplicate or whatever.\n\n353\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:34.136\nIf we want more Edge transport servers, we\njust install more Edge transport servers.\n\n354\n00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.249\nYou install a second or\na third or a fourth and\n\n355\n00:17:36.249 --> 00:17:39.117\nyou set up Edge subscriptions for\neach one of them, right?\n\n356\n00:17:39.117 --> 00:17:42.658\nYou do Egge subscriptions, they do their\nown Edge sync and they're up and running.\n\n357\n00:17:42.658 --> 00:17:43.780\nAll right so that's no big deal.\n\n358\n00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.670\nRedundancy on Edge transport\nserver is super easy.\n\n359\n00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.950\nAll we have to do to make it redundant for\nthe internet, is to go in and\n\n360\n00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.580\nmodify our MX records,\nour mail exchange records in DNS.\n\n361\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.250\nOur MX records should point to all\nof our Edge transport servers.\n\n362\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.560\nAnd you can set priorities to change\nwhich one gets used by default, but\n\n363\n00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.600\nif one fails,\npeople just move on to the next one.\n\n364\n00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.750\nSuper easy to do redundancy there.\n\n365\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.130\nWhere the challenge is comes\nin these rules, right.\n\n366\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.390\nThe configuration for the most part is\nbeing pushed from the mailbox server\n\n367\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.360\nto the Edge Transport server\nas part of Edge subscriptions.\n\n368\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.550\nBut these rules aren't.\n\n369\n00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.520\nI'm configuring these rules right\nhere on my Edge Transport server.\n\n370\n00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.711\nSo if I have five Edge transport servers,\nI just configured one of them.\n\n371\n00:18:23.711 --> 00:18:27.332\nI've now got to go and do the same thing\nover again on each of the other four edge\n\n372\n00:18:27.332 --> 00:18:30.040\ntransport servers and\nthat's kind of a pain.\n\n373\n00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.330\nFirst off,\nit's a pain just that I have to do it.\n\n374\n00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.810\nSecondly, it's a pain because, you guys\nsaw it I made some typos doing this.\n\n375\n00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.780\nWell, imagine if I had to\ndo it four more times.\n\n376\n00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.130\nI'm gonna get really frustrated\ncuz I suck at typing, right?\n\n377\n00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:44.320\nSo we don't want that, well fortunately\nMicrosoft made it pretty easy\n\n378\n00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.870\nto clone the configuration of one\nEdge transport server on your others.\n\n379\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.840\nWe can actually export this configuration\nwhich will include the rules.\n\n380\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.974\nAnd we can import that on our\nother Edge transport servers and\n\n381\n00:18:55.974 --> 00:18:58.310\nthey'll have the same rules.\n\n382\n00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:02.446\nIt's just cloning the config of an Edge\ntransport server and it's super easy.\n\n383\n00:19:02.446 --> 00:19:03.464\nI say it's super easy.\n\n384\n00:19:03.464 --> 00:19:05.002\nIt's super easy if you\nremember the commands,\n\n385\n00:19:05.002 --> 00:19:06.655\nwe gotta type of a few commands out here.\n\n386\n00:19:06.655 --> 00:19:10.160\nMicrosoft's actually created a few\nscripts for us that help us to do this.\n\n387\n00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.110\nLet me show you how it works.\n\n388\n00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.340\nI'm going to start here on my Edge\ntransport server that we just setup.\n\n389\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.390\nSo let's say this one is now setup,\nit's It's perfect,\n\n390\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.640\nit's got everything the way I want it.\n\n391\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.660\nSo I want to export its configuration.\n\n392\n00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.060\nWell,there's a script buried away\nin the Exchange install directory.\n\n393\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.590\nSo I need to get into the Exchange\ninstall directory which is\n\n394\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:38.100\nc:/programfiles/microsoft/exchangeserver/-\nversion15/scripts.\n\n395\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.310\nThat nice long path there rolls,\nright off the tongue.\n\n396\n00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.553\nThere's a ton of scripts in here,\nif you pull up the directory,\n\n397\n00:19:44.553 --> 00:19:46.543\nthat do all sorts of different things.\n\n398\n00:19:46.543 --> 00:19:50.084\nLook at all these PS1 files\nthat are rolling by, or PSD1s.\n\n399\n00:19:50.084 --> 00:19:52.560\nThere's a ton of stuff that\ncan do all sorts of things.\n\n400\n00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.990\nAll right, well what I want is I wanna\nbe able to export my configuration.\n\n401\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.990\nAnd so\nthere is a export edge config script.\n\n402\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.547\nIf I were to scroll around in here\nit would turn up somewhere in here.\n\n403\n00:20:04.547 --> 00:20:07.703\nExport, there it is, ExportEdgeConfig.ps1.\n\n404\n00:20:07.703 --> 00:20:08.850\nThat's the script I want.\n\n405\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.620\nIt's gonna let me export this config so\nI can then turn around and\n\n406\n00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.059\nimport it on other servers.\n\n407\n00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.950\nSo I'm gonna run that script.\n\n408\n00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.520\nI'm gonna call it, by saying .\\ because\nyou have to reference the folder name,\n\n409\n00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.970\ncuz this folder is not in the path.\n\n410\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.182\nPowerShell's really particular about that.\n\n411\n00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:30.308\nAnd I'm gonna call\nExportEdgeConfig.ps1 and\n\n412\n00:20:30.308 --> 00:20:35.062\nthen I'm gonna tell it to CloneConfigData.\n\n413\n00:20:35.062 --> 00:20:36.780\nAnd then I need to tell\nit where to clone it to.\n\n414\n00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.482\nAnd I'll just put it in c:\\EdgeConfig.xml.\n\n415\n00:20:41.482 --> 00:20:42.760\nIt is an xml file.\n\n416\n00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.346\nYou can give it whatever\nextension you want,\n\n417\n00:20:44.346 --> 00:20:46.620\nbut at the end of the day it is\nan xml file that it's gonna create.\n\n418\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.411\nAnd so this is gonna dump that\nconfiguration into C:\\EdgeConfig.xml.\n\n419\n00:20:51.411 --> 00:20:53.360\nOkay, so I'm gonna run that.\n\n420\n00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.440\nAnd it's now dumping that configuration,\nincluding all the rules and\n\n421\n00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.880\nother things into that file.\n\n422\n00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.560\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n423\n00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.620\nIt told me it's done.\n\n424\n00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.780\nAnd if I use Notepad,\nI can actually look at it.\n\n425\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:05.910\nAnd I can fire it up.\n\n426\n00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.989\nAnd here it is.\nWe can kinda browse in here, and\n\n427\n00:21:08.989 --> 00:21:11.267\nsee what that looks like.\n\n428\n00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:13.947\nLet me make this font a little bit\nbigger so we can kinda read it,\n\n429\n00:21:13.947 --> 00:21:16.985\nNotepad is not necessarily the greatest\nfor increasing font size, but\n\n430\n00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:19.390\nwe'll give it a shot, there we go.\n\n431\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.120\nAlright so looking at a lot of this\nis just information about like\n\n432\n00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.770\ndirectory sizes you know quotas and\nthings that are set on stuff.\n\n433\n00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.620\nBut there's some important\nthings in here as we look down\n\n434\n00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.200\nas far as our basic\nconfiguration is concerned.\n\n435\n00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.940\nAnd so as you scroll eventually in here,\nwe'll start to find things like\n\n436\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.420\nwhat our whitelists are,\nwhat our content filters are, and so on.\n\n437\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.760\nAnd this is a pretty big file.\n\n438\n00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.850\nIf I scroll through here,\n\n439\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.070\nyou'll see there is a lot of\ninformation tucked away in here.\n\n440\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.070\nAnd this is the full configuration\nof our Edge transport server.\n\n441\n00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.010\nThere's a lot in here.\n\n442\n00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.260\nHere I'm in some of, like,\nattachment filter entries, right?\n\n443\n00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.460\nAnd so we can see some of the filters.\n\n444\n00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.150\nLike here it's filtering out basic\nfiles and batch files and so on.\n\n445\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.470\nI think we added those in another show,\nso that's why they're turning up here.\n\n446\n00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.629\nBut each of the configs will\nbe located in here somewhere.\n\n447\n00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.290\nSo, I can take this and import it on\nanother system and I'll be in business.\n\n448\n00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.432\nExcept there's a little gotcha.\n\n449\n00:22:11.432 --> 00:22:16.500\nWhen it exports to config,\nit's the true config for this server.\n\n450\n00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.350\nAnd so there's information\nin here that is not unique.\n\n451\n00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.960\nFor example, right here.\n\n452\n00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.240\nThe distinguish name of\nthe server is LAB-EDGE01.\n\n453\n00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.580\nIf I'm gonna import this\nconfig on another server,\n\n454\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.645\nis that server gonna be called LAB-EDGE01?\n\n455\n00:22:30.645 --> 00:22:32.850\nNo, it's gonna have a different name.\n\n456\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.890\nSo, before I can use this file,\nI need to make it a little more generic.\n\n457\n00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.560\nI need to strip out the private stuff.\n\n458\n00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.220\nAnd the way we do that is not by\nactually stripping it out, but\n\n459\n00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.720\nby creating an answer file.\n\n460\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.760\nAn answer file takes this file,\nlocates the stuff\n\n461\n00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.450\nthat should be unique and it creates an\nanswer file that overrides those values.\n\n462\n00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.180\nWe need to override that distinguish name.\n\n463\n00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.455\nWe need to override any entry in here that\nrefers to the IP address of this server.\n\n464\n00:23:03.455 --> 00:23:05.900\nAnd fortunately we've got\na script that can do that too.\n\n465\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.660\nSo what we would do from here\nis we would take this file,\n\n466\n00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.210\nthis EdgeConfig.xml that we've just made.\n\n467\n00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.790\nWe would copy that to a USB key or\nwhatever and take it to our other Edge\n\n468\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:21.920\nservers, and on the other Edge servers,\nstep one you'll generate an answer file.\n\n469\n00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.350\nCuz the answer file is\ngonna be different for\n\n470\n00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.230\neach Edge server it's gonna be\na different name, different IP address.\n\n471\n00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:31.380\nAnd then two, we import the config\nwith our newly created answer file.\n\n472\n00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.760\nSo let me show you how to\ncreate an answer file.\n\n473\n00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.550\nI'm just gonna do it\nhere in the same server,\n\n474\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.361\nbut it doesn't matter it will be the same\non any server that we ran it on.\n\n475\n00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.880\nSo it's a script, I'll need to get\nin the script directory first,\n\n476\n00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.690\nwhich is this where I already am.\n\n477\n00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:47.050\nAnd then from here I'm gonna call\nthe script ImportEdgeConfig.\n\n478\n00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.920\nSo I did ExportEdgeConfig to get it out,\nimport is what's gonna bring it in.\n\n479\n00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.210\nNow I'm not actually importing here.\n\n480\n00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.630\nI'm creating an answer file.\n\n481\n00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.250\nSo I'm gonna tell it in a minute\nthat this is not a true import.\n\n482\n00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.340\nSo I'm gonna start just by\ncalling this script though.\n\n483\n00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.890\nImportEdgeConfig.ps1.\n\n484\n00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:07.212\nI'm gonna tell it where\nI'm getting my data from.\n\n485\n00:24:07.212 --> 00:24:13.560\nSo -CloneConfigData: and\nthen I'll point to where I put the file.\n\n486\n00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.950\nSo, so far it's kinda the same\nas the other command.\n\n487\n00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:17.580\nRight?\n\n488\n00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.190\nBut here's where things\nget a little different.\n\n489\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.757\nI need to add -IsImport $false.\n\n490\n00:24:23.757 --> 00:24:25.220\nAll right.\n\n491\n00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.530\nThat's what's gonna let the script know,\ndon't import this config yet.\n\n492\n00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.870\nRun in your other mode.\n\n493\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.230\nThe only other mode is to\ngenerate an answer file.\n\n494\n00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.761\nSo by doing IsImport $false,\ntells it to create an answer file.\n\n495\n00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:43.630\nAnd then I can say CloneConfigAnswer: and\n\n496\n00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.380\ntell it where I want\nthe answer file to be.\n\n497\n00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.884\nAnd I'll just make this one C:/answer.xml.\n\n498\n00:24:48.884 --> 00:24:50.130\nAll right.\n\n499\n00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.390\nSo now it's gonna run.\n\n500\n00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.420\nIt's not going to import the config,\n\n501\n00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:00.785\nit's gonna locate any unique values, and\ncreate an answer file overriding them.\n\n502\n00:25:00.785 --> 00:25:03.110\nOverriding anywhere\nthe computer name is used,\n\n503\n00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:07.050\nanywhere the IP address is used,\nanywhere the private encryption key.\n\n504\n00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.150\nSee how it's got this here,\n\n505\n00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.610\npasswords will be encrypted with the\ndefault script encryption key and so on?\n\n506\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.730\nBasically, we have an Edge subscription\nhere that's different from the Edge\n\n507\n00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.380\nsubscription from the other server,\nand so we've got different keys,\n\n508\n00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.980\nwe've got different information, and so\nit's basically overriding that, okay.\n\n509\n00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.110\nAnd then once that's done,\n\n510\n00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.840\nit creates an answer file that\nhas everything that's different.\n\n511\n00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.220\nNow, my answer file is gonna be the least\nentertaining of any answer file.\n\n512\n00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.925\nCuz I ran it on the same server, right?\n\n513\n00:25:30.925 --> 00:25:32.980\nSo what's not gonna match?\n\n514\n00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.430\nNothing, everything's gonna match here,\nso it doesn't have to override anything.\n\n515\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.190\nBut on a different server it has to\noverride name, IP, security key,\n\n516\n00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.660\nit has to override a lot of stuff.\n\n517\n00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:45.645\nSo when you look at the answer\nfile that created, so for me,\n\n518\n00:25:45.645 --> 00:25:50.950\nC:/answer.xml, it'll have this\nmachine specific settings.\n\n519\n00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:55.400\nAnd in between these two tags,\nit'll have all the overridden values.\n\n520\n00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.820\nEverything that should be\nunique will be overridden,\n\n521\n00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.120\nand it'll update it to reflect\nthe server that you're on.\n\n522\n00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.010\nSo it populates it out\nexactly as you need it.\n\n523\n00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:09.210\nAnd at that stage, now you can just import\nit and it'll have everything you need.\n\n524\n00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:13.082\nYou can just hit your up arrow\nto bring that command back and\n\n525\n00:26:13.082 --> 00:26:18.640\nwhere you've got IsImport $false,\nyou change that to IsImport $true, right?\n\n526\n00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.360\nNow it knows that you wanna do the import,\nand\n\n527\n00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.200\nthis is the answer file that it's\ngoing to read instead of writing.\n\n528\n00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.070\nAnd now it's gonna import the config and\n\n529\n00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:31.620\nget us all set up the way that we want\nit to be, and we'll be in business.\n\n530\n00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.940\nSo if I get all the rules set\nup perfectly on one server,\n\n531\n00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.070\nI run the ExportEdgeConfig\nscript to dump its config.\n\n532\n00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.630\nI copy the config to all my other servers.\n\n533\n00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.100\nI do the import as a false to\ngenerate the answer file and\n\n534\n00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.705\nthen I do the import as a true.\n\n535\n00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:48.810\nAnd I've even seen people where,\n\n536\n00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.990\nif you make a lot of changes to your\nservers, where they automate this.\n\n537\n00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.590\nWhere they say, every night at midnight,\ndump the configs\n\n538\n00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.720\ncopy into the other servers and\nhave the other servers import them.\n\n539\n00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.540\nYou can automate them through\nPowerShell scripts and\n\n540\n00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.760\nthe task scheduler, if you want.\n\n541\n00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.770\nBut even running it\nmanually is not a big deal,\n\n542\n00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.150\nif you don't make a lot of\nchanges on your Edge servers.\n\n543\n00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.270\nSo, here we run through that process,\nwe get loaded up, and you're in business.\n\n544\n00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:13.790\nSo this is the real power of the Edge\nservers, is that we can configure\n\n545\n00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:17.910\nvery specific rules that dictate what\nemail's allowed through and what isn't.\n\n546\n00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.460\nWe can do whitelist, blacklist,\ncontent filters, all that crazy stuff, and\n\n547\n00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.508\nit happens before the email gets\ninside of our organization.\n\n548\n00:27:25.508 --> 00:27:29.810\nAnd then second, we can easily clone\nit across more than one Edge server,\n\n549\n00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.730\nwhich makes redundancy and\nbackups super easy.\n\n550\n00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:33.680\nWe don't need clusters.\n\n551\n00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.140\nWe don't need shared storage.\n\n552\n00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.549\nWe just clone this simple config cross\nthe systems and you're in business.\n\n553\n00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:41.050\nAnd even in terms of doing\nbackups of the server,\n\n554\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.291\nwe don't really need to backup\nan Edge Transport server do we?\n\n555\n00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:47.580\nIf we have that Edge config file,\nthat config export,\n\n556\n00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.081\nbecause we can build up an all new server\nand just import that config file and\n\n557\n00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:53.880\nnow it's back the way it was.\n\n558\n00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.200\nYou'll have to setup the Edge subscription\nagain, you've always gotta do that but\n\n559\n00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.200\notherwise we can import that file and\nyou're back in business.\n\n560\n00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.660\nSo instead of backing up the server you\njust copy that XML file to a USB key\n\n561\n00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.880\nand you're done.\n\n562\n00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.200\nAnd if you don't change it for six months,\nyou don't need to back it up for\n\n563\n00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.775\nsix months cuz the key has\neverything that you need.\n\n564\n00:28:08.775 --> 00:28:12.550\nEdge Transport servers don't really hold\nany sensitive data other than the rule\n\n565\n00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.395\nconfiguration.\n\n566\n00:28:13.395 --> 00:28:14.520\nSo pretty easy to get that.\n\n567\n00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.828\nAll right, well that's about all\nI've got on Edge Transport servers.\n\n568\n00:28:18.828 --> 00:28:20.940\nSo this is a pretty good\nspot to wrap this one up.\n\n569\n00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.900\nIn this episode we got a chance to see\nconfiguring various rule types and\n\n570\n00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.240\na few real world examples there.\n\n571\n00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.980\nAnd then we wrapped up talking\nabout how to export those rules and\n\n572\n00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.500\nimport them on our other Edge\ntransport servers for redundancy.\n\n573\n00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.600\nAnd, on that note, that's about all I've\ngot to say on Edge transport servers, so\n\n574\n00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.440\nwe're gonna wrap it up here.\n\n575\n00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.529\nI hope you guys enjoyed it,\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n576\n00:28:41.529 --> 00:28:42.877\nAnd I'll see you next time.\n\n577\n00:28:42.877 --> 00:28:49.260\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

good evening.\n\n4\n00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.457\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:19.820\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again with\nanother episode of Microsoft Exchange.\n\n6\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.880\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at some pretty important stuff.\n\n7\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.610\nBecause it's all about monitoring and\nmaintaining our exchange environment.\n\n8\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.190\nNow when we get Exchange all configured,\nand put into place, and everything's\n\n9\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.170\nworking the way we want, that's great,\nbut things rarely stay that way.\n\n10\n00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.550\nYou guys know as well as I do\nthat the longer a server runs,\n\n11\n00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.840\nthe more likely issues are going to arise.\n\n12\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.150\nAnd we need to know how to be able\nto spot that problems are there and\n\n13\n00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.130\nthen to try and isolate the areas where\nthe problems are originating from.\n\n14\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.100\nSo we can kind of keep our service up and\nrunning and healthy.\n\n15\n00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.550\nSo that's what we wanna\ntackle in this episode,\n\n16\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.320\nsome of the different things to look out\nfor, some of the different tools that\n\n17\n00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.630\nare available for us and which tools are\nappropriate for which needs, all right.\n\n18\n00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.760\nNow, obviously monitoring our exchange\nenvironment is a pretty big topic.\n\n19\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.690\nThere's a lot of different\nthings to monitor.\n\n20\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.590\nAnd I've kind of shown you some of those\nthroughout this series as we've gone along\n\n21\n00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.150\nbut, just in general, let's say this\nis your first day at a brand new job.\n\n22\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.570\nYou've got this exchange environment\nyou've never touched before and\n\n23\n00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.000\nyou just wanna look at it and get\nan idea of whether it's healthy or not.\n\n24\n00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.150\nAll right.\nWell,\n\n25\n00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.810\nlet me walk you through some of the\ndifferent things that I like to look at\n\n26\n00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.120\njust for my own self when I go work\non these types of environments.\n\n27\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.380\nOne of the first places I\nlike to start is replication.\n\n28\n00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.900\nAll right.\n\n29\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.910\nMost people who deploy\nexchange in this day in age\n\n30\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.140\nare gonna worry about redundancy.\n\n31\n00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.950\nThey're gonna worry about availability.\n\n32\n00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.256\nIf you're really worried about problems on\nyour network, you need to have a plan B.\n\n33\n00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:41.115\nRight?\n\n34\n00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:45.920\nAnd there's no better plan B than\nreplicated server stored somewhere else.\n\n35\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.500\nNow for client access servers we don't\nreally have to worry about it so much,\n\n36\n00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.840\nright, because on a client access server,\n\n37\n00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.730\nif I want redundancy I just bring\nup another client access server.\n\n38\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.560\nThere's no real data stored in them.\n\n39\n00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.290\nThat's easy, right.\n\n40\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.680\nThere's nothing really to deal with there.\n\n41\n00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.740\nBut on the mailbox side it's\na lot more challenging.\n\n42\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.690\nAnd we saw that back in the database\navailability groups episodes,\n\n43\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.160\nif you haven't see those yet,\njust definitely jump over and watch those.\n\n44\n00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.960\nBut with a database availability group,\n\n45\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.810\nexchange is basically\nsetting up a cluster,\n\n46\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.110\na cluster without shared storage which\nmeans that whole mailbox database\n\n47\n00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.320\nhas to be replicated across the network\nto whoever else is in that cluster.\n\n48\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.820\nAnd when you set that up initially,\nthings might go great.\n\n49\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.850\nBut then over time,\nnetwork conditions might change or\n\n50\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.840\nserver conditions might change, and that\nreplication might not be working properly.\n\n51\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.110\nAnd if that's the case,\n\n52\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.910\nyou might have a fully redundant\nenvironment that's way out of date.\n\n53\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.660\nAnd the data that you're replicating is\njust not making it to the other side, and\n\n54\n00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.520\nnow when a failure occurs, that\nredundant copy doesn't help you, right?\n\n55\n00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.440\nOr even worse,\nmaybe the redundant copy is down, and\n\n56\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.290\nyou don't know it,\nbecause the main copy is up and running.\n\n57\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.225\nIf the main database is up and running,\nyour end users are in their email,\n\n58\n00:02:56.225 --> 00:03:00.610\neverything's happy, mail is flowing,\nyou might not realize that meanwhile,\n\n59\n00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.460\non the back end, a secondary copy of\nthat database is actually off line.\n\n60\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.950\nSo it's important that we monitor that and\nwe keep an eye on it, and\n\n61\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.230\nthere's a few different ways to do that.\n\n62\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.700\nNow I know we can go through\nthe exchange administration center.\n\n63\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.660\nThe webpage.\n\n64\n00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.630\nWe can browse in there.\n\n65\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.900\nWe get some basic status information.\n\n66\n00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.945\nBut the really good data\nis found in the PowerShell.\n\n67\n00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:22.685\nThere's a ton of PowerShell commandlets\nthat we can use to look at performance on\n\n68\n00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:27.035\nour server, as well as just\ndoing various health tests, and\n\n69\n00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:29.855\nthere's the good old trusty\nperformance monitor.\n\n70\n00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:34.545\nThe performance monitor gives us a ton of\ndata about all the aspects of our system\n\n71\n00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:35.685\nand so we can use those too.\n\n72\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.810\nSo let's say this is me sitting down\non a server for the first time and\n\n73\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.780\nI wanna make sure that\nreplication is running smooth.\n\n74\n00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.410\nLet's walk through the paces.\n\n75\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.990\nLet me start here with the GUI.\n\n76\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.810\nIn the GUI, we can quickly just\njump right down to servers.\n\n77\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.630\nAnd then under servers, you can take\na look at a few different places.\n\n78\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.730\nWe've got our servers right here,\nthey kind of show up,\n\n79\n00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.500\nobviously your server\nshould be in the list.\n\n80\n00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.377\nIf we go to databases you should be able\nto find your database like I've got this\n\n81\n00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:04.807\none here, sales DB and it shows us\nhaving multiples copies, right.\n\n82\n00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:09.260\nSo this database is present on two\ndifferent servers lab mailbox 01 and\n\n83\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.109\nlab castle 1, so\nit should be in both places.\n\n84\n00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd over here on the right side if I\nscroll down I'll see some basic health\n\n85\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.380\ninformation.\n\n86\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.030\nNow the health information isn't\nreally all that great, right.\n\n87\n00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.840\nI mean it's showing me that it's active\nand mounted here, it's passive and\n\n88\n00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.560\nhealthy down here, right?\n\n89\n00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.780\nSo those are good.\n\n90\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.530\nWhat I really need to look for\nis this guy right here.\n\n91\n00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.910\nCopy queue length.\n\n92\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.510\nOkay?\n\n93\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.300\nNow what is the copy queue length?\n\n94\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.320\nWell, when a change happens, right,\n\n95\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.630\nwhen email comes in it's writing\nto whoever's active and mounted.\n\n96\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.160\nSo in my case it's writing to mailbox01.\n\n97\n00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.490\nAnd then once that's done,\n\n98\n00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.410\nthe transaction log that contains that\nrite is shipped over to the other server.\n\n99\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.110\nWell, that's the copy queue.\n\n100\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.560\nAnd the more transaction\nlogs in the copy queue,\n\n101\n00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.040\nthe further behind I am,\nthe busier your server is.\n\n102\n00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.960\nA single transaction log file might\nonly have a few seconds worth of email.\n\n103\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.230\nIf you have a really slow email flow,\nright, if you don't get a ton of email,\n\n104\n00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.820\none transaction log file might\nhave an hour's worth of emails, so\n\n105\n00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.620\nit kind of varies how much is actually\nin that transaction log file.\n\n106\n00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.380\nBut down here, this copy queue link.\n\n107\n00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.150\nIf you see it greater than zero for long\nperiods of time, it could mean that you\n\n108\n00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.650\ndon't have enough bandwidth between\nyour two servers to properly replicate.\n\n109\n00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.960\nOr at a minimum it means you\nneed to be acceptant of the fact\n\n110\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.130\nthat if you have a failure,\nyou might lose some data.\n\n111\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.850\nThere might be some data that just hadn't\nhad time to copy to the other side.\n\n112\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.920\nNow I do have a little\ncomplaint about this screen.\n\n113\n00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.640\nAnd the complaint I have is when\nI see copy queue length here,\n\n114\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.960\nthis is a really generic thing.\n\n115\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.490\nIt's telling me I've have some\nchanges on the active server,\n\n116\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.380\nthey're waiting to be\nsent to the other side.\n\n117\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.260\nOkay.\n\n118\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.760\nBut they could actually already\nbe sent to the other side.\n\n119\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.410\nThey could already be\non the other side and\n\n120\n00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.230\nthe other side just hasn't had time to\napply it to it's copy of the database.\n\n121\n00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.390\nThere might be some kind of problem\non the server on the other end.\n\n122\n00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.970\nAnd this isn't gonna tell me that.\n\n123\n00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.970\nIf I see this number getting bigger and\nbigger and\n\n124\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.830\nbigger, I know there's a problem, but\nI don't really know what the problem is.\n\n125\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.280\nIt could be network connectivity.\n\n126\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.280\nI can't even get to the other side.\n\n127\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.480\nOr the server on the other side might\nbe under powered and it's just getting\n\n128\n00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.475\noverwhelmed and it cannot keep up and\nit is getting further and further behind.\n\n129\n00:06:17.475 --> 00:06:21.130\nThat's not a network issue at all,\nthat's CPU, disk IO.\n\n130\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.349\nRight?\nThings like that on that other server.\n\n131\n00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.718\nSo I do not get a whole heck of a lot of\ndata here and I will show you a way to get\n\n132\n00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:29.943\nsomething more specific out of\nthe performance monitor in a moment.\n\n133\n00:06:29.943 --> 00:06:31.770\nNow what you are seeing here.\n\n134\n00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.810\nThis is part of the diagnostic\nhealth service and exchange.\n\n135\n00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.770\nIt's running in the background.\n\n136\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.410\nIt has a series of what iare\ncalled probes that run and\n\n137\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.210\nmonitor all sorts of aspects\nof your Exchange environment.\n\n138\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.270\nAnd so it's actively monitoring this\ninformation and displaying it here.\n\n139\n00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.640\nAnd that's why we have\nthings like view details.\n\n140\n00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.583\nBecause we can jump into that to see\nadditional information that's being\n\n141\n00:06:51.583 --> 00:06:53.090\nmonitored on the back end.\n\n142\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.940\nAnd right here,\nI can see the copy queue length and\n\n143\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.300\nthe replay queue length, all right,\nthe replay queue length.\n\n144\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.250\nThat says, this is data that has already\nbeen copied to the other side, but\n\n145\n00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.590\nit hasn't been applied yet,\nit's waiting to be replayed.\n\n146\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.420\nAnd if we see those at zero like I've got,\n\n147\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.120\nthat means my two servers\nare completely in sync.\n\n148\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.770\nBut if I see the number consistently\ngetting larger, and larger, and\n\n149\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.270\nlarger that means the other\nserver is getting behind.\n\n150\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.440\nAnd you can see a lot of other information\nin here on the health of your system.\n\n151\n00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.160\nNow if you have access to the GUI,\nthis is great.\n\n152\n00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.800\nIf you don't have access to the GUI well,\nthere's a few other ways we can get at it.\n\n153\n00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.562\nAnd I like to use the PowerShell on this\nbecause there's actually a really simple\n\n154\n00:07:31.562 --> 00:07:35.100\nPowerShell command we can run that\nwill scan the health of the system.\n\n155\n00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.670\nIf we jump over to here,\n\n156\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.720\nmy other server that's got\nthe PowerShell already fired up.\n\n157\n00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.960\nNow this is the Exchange Management Shell,\nnot just the normal PowerShell.\n\n158\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.340\nThere's a command, or a command lit,\ncalled test Replication health.\n\n159\n00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:49.910\nAll right.\n\n160\n00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.851\nThe test replication health command that\nlets you scan across all the replications\n\n161\n00:07:53.851 --> 00:07:56.728\non your system and\nshow you whether they're healthy or not.\n\n162\n00:07:56.728 --> 00:08:00.250\nAnd it's pretty straightforward to run,\nyou just point it at a server.\n\n163\n00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.805\nSo I'll specify an identity and\nI'll point this out loud.\n\n164\n00:08:02.805 --> 00:08:03.752\nCastle one.\n\n165\n00:08:03.752 --> 00:08:04.930\nHere, I'll do mailbox.\n\n166\n00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.510\nMailbox 01.\n\n167\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.180\nAll right.\n\n168\n00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.130\nSo it's going to check that server and\n\n169\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.690\ngive me information\nabout replication on it.\n\n170\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.490\nAnd it's gonna lay it out right here.\n\n171\n00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.850\nNotice how it's checking a lot more\nthan just the current que lane.\n\n172\n00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.960\nWell those probes that are running in\nthe background are checking all this\n\n173\n00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.020\nstuff already.\n\n174\n00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.330\nIt's just the GUI for\nthe Exchange Administration Center.\n\n175\n00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.080\nIt doesn't display all this.\n\n176\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.040\nSo from the commandlet here,\nfrom the PowerShell,\n\n177\n00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.310\nwe can see it, the cluster service,\nthe replay service.\n\n178\n00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.240\nSo all these different services\nthat are a part of this database\n\n179\n00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.470\navailability group structure,\nthey're all passing, they're all healthy.\n\n180\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.350\nIf one of them isn't, I'll have\nan error here, and it'll tell me why.\n\n181\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.960\nMaybe the service isn't started,\nmaybe there's access denied,\n\n182\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.680\nmaybe it's network unreachable.\n\n183\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.960\nIt'll tell me what that reason is.\n\n184\n00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.420\nNow I do have some failures,\nfailures in some pretty important ones.\n\n185\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.180\nDatabase redundancy,\ndatabase availability, they both failed.\n\n186\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.340\nWhat's that all about?\n\n187\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.220\nWell unfortunately, the way this\nis laid out, I can't really tell,\n\n188\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.330\nso I'm gonna re-run the command.\n\n189\n00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.960\nAnd I'm just gonna drop that into\na Format List, or some other\n\n190\n00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.210\nformatting if you want to change it\nto be able to see what the deal is.\n\n191\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.530\nAnd when this runs,\nit's just gonna take this output,\n\n192\n00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.130\nand there's more on the screen, it's not\nshowing up here, and it's just gonna lay\n\n193\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.290\nit out in a list format, so\nI can actually read what's going on.\n\n194\n00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:22.180\nAnd if I run that, I'm gonna see all\nthose passes are gonna come across like\n\n195\n00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.640\nyou'll see here,\nas we look down this list.\n\n196\n00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.040\nLike here's where it checked for\n\n197\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.420\nwhether the database availability\ngroup members are up.\n\n198\n00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.330\nIt checks whether there were\nserver locator services running.\n\n199\n00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.580\nThese all passed.\n\n200\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.500\nBut of I get down to the ones that failed,\nso I'm just looking for that fail keyword.\n\n201\n00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.790\nHere we go.\n\n202\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.190\nI can see here that on\nserver lab-mailbox 01,\n\n203\n00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.260\nI have database redundancy\nshows as failed.\n\n204\n00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.580\nAnd it tells me here what this check did.\n\n205\n00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.180\nThis check verified that databases\nhave sufficient redundancy.\n\n206\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.360\nIf the check fails, it means some\ndatabases are at risk of losing data.\n\n207\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.980\nIn other words,\nyou've only got one copy of the database.\n\n208\n00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.720\nOr at a minimum, you have one less\ncopy than you thought you did.\n\n209\n00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.790\nThen it tells me why.\n\n210\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.950\nIt just tells me, hey there's certain\ndatabases here that don't have redundancy.\n\n211\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.000\nIt's telling me mailbox database 009,\nblah, blah,\n\n212\n00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.040\nblah doesn't have a redundancy.\n\n213\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.600\nAll right, well I never configured a\nredundancy for it, so I kinda expect that.\n\n214\n00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.523\nI can figure redundancy for\nthe sales database, for sales db.\n\n215\n00:10:18.523 --> 00:10:21.720\nI never did it for\nthis mailbox database, or the other one.\n\n216\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.050\nAnd so\nthat's the one that's showing up next.\n\n217\n00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.710\nThis other mailbox database\nis not showing as redundant.\n\n218\n00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.890\nIn the GUI, you can sort of see that.\n\n219\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.380\nJust right here on the database list.\n\n220\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.280\nSee how when I look at sales db\nit's got two servers listed?\n\n221\n00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.290\nThe other guys don't.\n\n222\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.100\nThe other guys just\nhave one server listed.\n\n223\n00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.630\nThey are not redundant.\n\n224\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.962\nEven if I add that database to\nthe database availability group,\n\n225\n00:10:41.962 --> 00:10:43.390\nit still only has one copy.\n\n226\n00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.036\nIt is not until I add a second copy\nthat it becomes redundant and so\n\n227\n00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:48.290\nit is going to generate that failure.\n\n228\n00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.500\nSo be aware when you run\nthe test-replication health commandlet,\n\n229\n00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.220\nsometimes you get fail messages back and\nit is not a bad thing it is just\n\n230\n00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.960\nsome databases are redundant,\nyou haven't made them that way.\n\n231\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.150\nYou should go in and\nconfigure them if you need that,\n\n232\n00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.500\nif that's what you're trying to achieve.\n\n233\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.530\nSo that's one command\nload that we can use, and\n\n234\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.650\nthere's a few other ones\nthat we can do too.\n\n235\n00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:13.820\nFor example, what I did here,\nthis test replication health command.\n\n236\n00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.740\nThat checked all the databases, but\n\n237\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.290\nI might wanna look at\none particular database.\n\n238\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.020\nI might wanna kinda dial in\non one that I'm targeting.\n\n239\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:28.240\nAnd so for that, I can use this\nGet-MailboxDatabaseCopy Status.\n\n240\n00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.375\nThis has got to be one\nof the longer commands.\n\n241\n00:11:30.375 --> 00:11:36.610\nSo I'm gonna do\nGet-MailboxDatabase Copy status.\n\n242\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.250\nAll right?\n\n243\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.810\nI want to look at one of\nmy mailbox databases, and\n\n244\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.310\njust see what the current\nstatus of its replication is.\n\n245\n00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.200\nWhat's it look like right now?\n\n246\n00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.740\nAnd so, just like the other one,\nI need to specify an identity.\n\n247\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.230\nAnd then a name of the database.\n\n248\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.700\nSo mine is sales db.\n\n249\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.570\nAnd I'll run that, and\n\n250\n00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.350\nit's just going to give me something\ndialed in on that one database.\n\n251\n00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.310\nI can see I've got two copies.\n\n252\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.407\nThe main copy is here in our lab mailbox,\n\n253\n00:11:59.407 --> 00:12:02.005\nI know it's the main copy\nbecause it's mounted.\n\n254\n00:12:02.005 --> 00:12:06.710\nIt's active right now and then\nthe other one lab class 01 is healthy.\n\n255\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.680\nIt's not mounted, but it's healthy, it's\nready to take over at a moments notice if\n\n256\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.220\nneed be, and\nI can see the copy que length and\n\n257\n00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.079\nthe replay que length right there it's got\nthe information I need and it's healthy.\n\n258\n00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.800\nSome things you might notice in here\neven on a healthy database, if you\n\n259\n00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.640\njust re-booted one of these servers or if\nyou just built the database availability\n\n260\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.050\ngroup, expect to see the context\nindex state as failed or unhealthy.\n\n261\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.250\nI don't remember exactly\nwhich error state it shows.\n\n262\n00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.550\nBut basically when new\nservers are created or\n\n263\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.480\nare added to a dag or when a server is\nrebooted, is has to rebuild it's index.\n\n264\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.590\nAnd the index takes time to reboot, so it\ncould take a good five or ten minutes, or\n\n265\n00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.690\neven longer if it's a large database,\nto correct that information and\n\n266\n00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:49.400\nget it up to date.\n\n267\n00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.890\nBut you can see mine's\nbeen running long enough,\n\n268\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.360\nit's all healthy, and it's good to go.\n\n269\n00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.365\nSo quick and easy way to monitor\nthat from the PowerShell.\n\n270\n00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.820\nNow everything that I'm looking at so\nfar Is real time data.\n\n271\n00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.410\nI'm seeing the system as it is right now.\n\n272\n00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.040\nSo when I ran that command a moment ago,\nmy Copy Que Length was 0 and\n\n273\n00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.330\nmy Replay Que Length was 0.\n\n274\n00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.846\nBut what about now?\n\n275\n00:13:11.846 --> 00:13:12.860\nWhat about now?\nWhat about now, right?\n\n276\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.010\nWe might want to know\nover a period of time.\n\n277\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.690\nSure, it might be caught up right now, but\n\n278\n00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.620\nit might be lagging behind\nat certain point in the day.\n\n279\n00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.640\nSo what we can do is we can use a script\nthat comes with Microsoft Exchange\n\n280\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.710\nthat allows us to monitor that replication\ntraffic over a certain period of time.\n\n281\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.990\nAnd you can dictate it.\n\n282\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.750\nWhen we run this script\nthe default is 30 seconds.\n\n283\n00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.600\nBut you can specify a start time and\nan end time and so you can have it run for\n\n284\n00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.340\nan hour, 24 hours.\n\n285\n00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.140\nYou can run it for\na whole week if you want to go crazy.\n\n286\n00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.500\nIt's a lot of data, but\nit can gather that data for us and\n\n287\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.700\nthen put it out in a nice little report.\n\n288\n00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.580\nLet me show you the command.\n\n289\n00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.390\nFirst off we have to give it\nto our scripts directory,\n\n290\n00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.635\nwhich if you guys remember\nis really buried in there.\n\n291\n00:13:50.635 --> 00:13:55.740\nOn any exchange server you\ncan jump into C:/program\n\n292\n00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:04.660\nfiles/Microsoft/exchangeserver/V15/Scri-\npts.\n\n293\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.870\nThat's the full path to\nthat script directory.\n\n294\n00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.510\nAnd in there, there's a bunch\nof scripts that are in there.\n\n295\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:18.350\nBut the one that I'm looking for\nis actually called Collectovermetrics.ps1.\n\n296\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.682\nThat guy right there,\nCollectovermetrics.ps.1.\n\n297\n00:14:21.682 --> 00:14:26.990\nAnd that's gonna basically gather this\nreplication data over a period of time,\n\n298\n00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.640\nand then it aggregates it into\na report that I can view.\n\n299\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.430\nSo if I want to run that,\nthe way the script works is\n\n300\n00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.180\nyou really just call the script and\nyou point it at a server.\n\n301\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.720\nThe start time and end time are optional.\n\n302\n00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.650\nIf you don't specify it'll just run for\n30 seconds, and that's what I want,\n\n303\n00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.260\nI'm just gonna run it for 30 seconds.\n\n304\n00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.164\nSo, I'm gonna execute this script.\n\n305\n00:14:47.173 --> 00:14:51.573\nAnd I'm gonna tell it which database\navailability group that I want to query,\n\n306\n00:14:51.573 --> 00:14:56.107\nright, and so I'm gonna be reaching out\nto the only database availability group\n\n307\n00:14:56.107 --> 00:15:00.129\nI have, but if you have more than one\nyou need to specify the right name.\n\n308\n00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:00.970\nMine's dag01.\n\n309\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.030\nAnd then I need to tell\nit a database to monitor.\n\n310\n00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.010\nThis is gonna monitor\na particular database.\n\n311\n00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:13.150\nI'm gonna monitor the sales db and\nthen after that, if I just run it,\n\n312\n00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:18.150\nI'm going to get this text data back,\nand I want to get a nice, fancy report.\n\n313\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.560\nSo I'm going to say generate HTML report.\n\n314\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.110\nIf I just leave it there,\nit's going to generate the HTML report and\n\n315\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.790\nit's going to save it to a file or\nas you can expect a file name, but\n\n316\n00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.520\nyou can add if this is like a one time\nthing, you can add show HTML report, and\n\n317\n00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.030\nwhen it's done it will just launch it for\nus in browser so that we can see it.\n\n318\n00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:42.470\nSo the full command here is\ncollectovermetrics,PS1-databaseavailabili-\n\n319\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.360\ntygroup and\n\n320\n00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.420\nthe name of the group, then -database: and\nwhatever the database name is.\n\n321\n00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:48.932\nAnd be aware,\n\n322\n00:15:48.932 --> 00:15:51.857\nif you have any spaces in your database\nname you'll need to put quotes around it.\n\n323\n00:15:51.857 --> 00:15:55.844\nIn fact, it's not a bad idea to just\nalways put quotes around it to kinda\n\n324\n00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:57.250\nget in the habit of that.\n\n325\n00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.456\nAnd then I'm generating an HTML\nreport as opposed to plain text.\n\n326\n00:16:00.456 --> 00:16:02.507\nAnd I wanna see that report.\n\n327\n00:16:02.507 --> 00:16:05.049\nAnd when we run it,\nit's gonna run for 30 seconds,\n\n328\n00:16:05.049 --> 00:16:07.255\nit's collecting that replication data and,\n\n329\n00:16:07.255 --> 00:16:10.720\nI don't know, maybe I can generate\nsome replication data of some sort.\n\n330\n00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.220\nI don't know if I'll be fast enough\nhere to grab somebody's mailbox and\n\n331\n00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.920\nmaybe move them to\na different mailbox server.\n\n332\n00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.381\nThat's way down here, and\nmy timer is ticking, isn't it?\n\n333\n00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:24.700\n[LAUGH] So we'll see, of course,\n\n334\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.370\nit's gonna make me type things and\ntry and get this guy moved in.\n\n335\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.110\nI think my 30 seconds might already be up,\nbut let's see if I can get it in there.\n\n336\n00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.115\nDo it, go, run!\n\n337\n00:16:33.115 --> 00:16:35.530\n[LAUGH] There we go, okay.\n\n338\n00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:41.060\nSo now I'm moving a mailbox from\nanother database into the Sales DB.\n\n339\n00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.811\nSo when that mailbox moves,\nit's gonna move into, well,\n\n340\n00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:46.773\nSales DB on the active member.\n\n341\n00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:48.903\nAnd the active member's\ngonna start replicating that\n\n342\n00:16:48.903 --> 00:16:50.020\nover to the standby member.\n\n343\n00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.472\nSo, I moved it,\nit's gonna go to mailbox01.\n\n344\n00:16:52.472 --> 00:16:56.750\nAnd then mailbox01 is gonna do\ntransaction log shipping over to cas01 so\n\n345\n00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.290\nthat cas01 can receive it and\nreplay those logs and\n\n346\n00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.780\nhave that mailbox be present\nin that database too.\n\n347\n00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.360\nSo that's all happening in the background,\nI can see that's syncing right now.\n\n348\n00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.302\nSyncing means it's copying\nthe database between the two, and\n\n349\n00:17:09.302 --> 00:17:11.532\nthat's gonna kick off\nthat replication data.\n\n350\n00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:14.730\nAll right, so all that's happening\nkind of in the background there.\n\n351\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.083\nAnd if I jump over here,\nmy report already generated,\n\n352\n00:17:17.083 --> 00:17:20.000\nso I might have a bunch of zeroes,\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n353\n00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.320\nBut I can see in the background that\nI've got my web browser fired up.\n\n354\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.230\nAnd right here I can see my\ndatabase over summary statistics.\n\n355\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:32.020\nAnd here it's just gonna lay things out so\nI can see the total databases that I have,\n\n356\n00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:32.921\nI've got two.\n\n357\n00:17:32.921 --> 00:17:36.447\nThe ones that are mounted and\nstarted up, one that's mounted but\n\n358\n00:17:36.447 --> 00:17:37.740\nnot actually running.\n\n359\n00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.401\nAnd you can see other statistical\ninformation on them, right.\n\n360\n00:17:41.401 --> 00:17:44.225\nDid we have any failures during\nthe time we were monitoring?\n\n361\n00:17:44.225 --> 00:17:47.673\nHow many responses back were under\n30 seconds or over 30 seconds?\n\n362\n00:17:47.673 --> 00:17:51.381\nWhat's my lossy amount,\ndid I lose any data during that time?\n\n363\n00:17:51.381 --> 00:17:54.771\nAnd you can see mine,\nno failed operations found in the data.\n\n364\n00:17:54.771 --> 00:17:56.917\nNow, other data we see in here,\n\n365\n00:17:56.917 --> 00:18:02.258\nif I had things that took more than 30\nseconds it tries to lay out what that was.\n\n366\n00:18:02.258 --> 00:18:05.782\nAnd you can see down here\njust basic information, and\n\n367\n00:18:05.782 --> 00:18:07.514\nit lays out a lot of stuff.\n\n368\n00:18:07.514 --> 00:18:10.470\nKind of what happened during that time,\nand actually, mine was terrible,\n\n369\n00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.986\nwasn't it?\n\n370\n00:18:10.986 --> 00:18:14.716\n0 replayed logs, so that means [LAUGH]\nduring the 30 seconds I monitored,\n\n371\n00:18:14.716 --> 00:18:19.031\nthere actually wasn't even enough activity\nto generate 1 transaction log moving, so\n\n372\n00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:21.444\nof course I'm gonna see\nreally good stuff here.\n\n373\n00:18:21.444 --> 00:18:26.294\nBut it's just a nice graphical\nrepresentation that lets you spot whether\n\n374\n00:18:26.294 --> 00:18:28.430\nthings are healthy or not.\n\n375\n00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.490\nAnd kind of isolating if there's\nissues you need to deal with.\n\n376\n00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.250\nSo neat little command,\nit's a script that's a part of Exchange,\n\n377\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.820\nyou don't have to write it or\ndownload it or anything,\n\n378\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.105\nit's a part of your\ndefault Exchange install.\n\n379\n00:18:40.105 --> 00:18:43.870\nAll right, now these are all fine and\ngood, but all of these center\n\n380\n00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:48.260\naround command line utilities and\nme being present to run them.\n\n381\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.210\nWell, a lot of times I'm\nnot present to run them,\n\n382\n00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.580\nso I need something that can\nkinda go on in the background.\n\n383\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.320\nAnd one of the nice tools that's a part\nof Windows that lets us do this,\n\n384\n00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.760\nis the Performance Monitor.\n\n385\n00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.360\nWe can fire up the Performance Monitor and\n\n386\n00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.280\nthere's a number of performance counters\nthat specifically relate to replication.\n\n387\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.580\nAnd you can set that up and\ncouple it with performance alerts, and\n\n388\n00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.040\nnow you can have it where the server\nalerts you when there's a problem.\n\n389\n00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.360\nSo we don't have to go looking for\n\n390\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.200\na problem if we think it's occurring,\nwe get notified right away, all right?\n\n391\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:18.770\nLet me show you that.\n\n392\n00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.730\nSo, let's see, what server do I\nwant to use, I'll use this one.\n\n393\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.110\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nfire up my Performance Monitor.\n\n394\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.920\nThere we go, and\nremember the Performance Monitor,\n\n395\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.800\nit's a part of every Windows installation.\n\n396\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:38.130\nBut when you install Microsoft Exchange\non a server, it adds a lot more to it.\n\n397\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.990\nSo if you fired up the Performance Monitor\non your work station,\n\n398\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.170\nit's really just got Windows\nmonitoring in it, not Exchange.\n\n399\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.670\nBut when you fire up Performance Monitor\non an Exchange Server,\n\n400\n00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.430\nthere is a lot more.\n\n401\n00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.470\nSo if I go in here and\n\n402\n00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:55.300\nI go down to Performance Monitor,\nyou see it's monitoring %Processor Time,\n\n403\n00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.180\nwhich is a great thing to monitor,\nright, what's my CPU load?\n\n404\n00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:03.740\nBut we can hit this green + arrow, and\nstart to add more counters to it, right?\n\n405\n00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.040\nAnd when you look at the counters, most of\nthis is stuff that's related to Windows,\n\n406\n00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.030\nprocessor, memory,\ndisk I/O, things like that.\n\n407\n00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.320\nBut if you scroll around,\n\n408\n00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:16.740\nyou'll find in here MSExchange,\nand look how many are in there.\n\n409\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.670\nIt's added over 200 counters\nspecifically related\n\n410\n00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.840\njust to Exchange, and\nthere is a lot in there.\n\n411\n00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.400\nYou can monitor every single\naspect of Exchange right\n\n412\n00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.590\nfrom inside the the Performance Monitor.\n\n413\n00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.870\nNow, why is that important?\n\n414\n00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:37.713\nWell, I can create several counters\nthat are monitoring for criteria.\n\n415\n00:20:37.713 --> 00:20:39.543\nAnd then in the Performance Monitor,\n\n416\n00:20:39.543 --> 00:20:41.955\nwe can set up what are called\nData Collector Sets.\n\n417\n00:20:41.955 --> 00:20:44.220\nA Data Collector Set\nruns in the background.\n\n418\n00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.805\nIt runs and it collects data,\nthat's the name, right, so\n\n419\n00:20:46.805 --> 00:20:48.525\nit can gather data about replication.\n\n420\n00:20:48.525 --> 00:20:53.663\nBut what's even better is that when\nyou define a Data Collector Set,\n\n421\n00:20:53.663 --> 00:20:58.070\nyou can also define alerts\nthat occur as a result of it.\n\n422\n00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:02.240\nAnd so you can say, hey, if this threshold\nexceeds a certain value, send me an alert.\n\n423\n00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.310\nSend me an email or generate an event\nlog message, or do some kind of action.\n\n424\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.990\nSo now we can really get some\ninteractive monitoring out of this,\n\n425\n00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.560\nit just takes setting it up.\n\n426\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.310\nNow for replication, let me show\nyou the counters to watch out for.\n\n427\n00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:17.940\nI'm gonna go under Performance Monitor,\nand I'll hit that green + sign.\n\n428\n00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:23.110\nAnd I'm gonna look for the section\ncalled MS Exchange Replication.\n\n429\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.165\nSo it's in here somewhere.\n\n430\n00:21:27.266 --> 00:21:30.296\nIt gets a little confusing cuz\nsome of them are MSExchange,\n\n431\n00:21:30.296 --> 00:21:33.640\nsee how this one is MSExchangeRepl and\nit's all one word?\n\n432\n00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.516\nThe one I'm looking for is MSExchange,\nand then a space, and then Replication.\n\n433\n00:21:37.516 --> 00:21:41.560\nSo I've gotta find where that starts,\nit's up here.\n\n434\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.330\nIt does make things confusing,\nbut we'll spot it.\n\n435\n00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.450\nThere it is, MSExchange Replication.\n\n436\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.770\nAnd if I expand that,\nunderneath you'll see a bunch of counters,\n\n437\n00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.720\nthere's a ton of stuff here.\n\n438\n00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.950\nAnd some of it's important,\nsome of it's not,\n\n439\n00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.110\nsome of it is used in really\nspecial case scenarios.\n\n440\n00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.910\nBut some of the things that\nwe might want to monitor for?\n\n441\n00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.812\nWell, you've got information in here\nlike average network reads per second.\n\n442\n00:22:05.812 --> 00:22:09.150\nAll right, or\nother bandwidth type related issues,\n\n443\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.860\nhow much bandwidth is my\nreplication consuming?\n\n444\n00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.570\nWell, we don't normally worry\nabout that too much cuz you've got\n\n445\n00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.580\na certain amount of bandwidth available\nand email usually isn't that high.\n\n446\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.100\nBut in a high volume environment that\n\n447\n00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.860\nmight be something that\nyou want to monitor.\n\n448\n00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.000\nYou could also monitor your network\ninterfaces to see if they were over.\n\n449\n00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.990\nBut the ones I'm concerned about, well,\nthe first one is copy queue length, right?\n\n450\n00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.431\nCopy queue length, we saw that in the GUI,\nthat was a pretty important one.\n\n451\n00:22:31.431 --> 00:22:35.570\nI need to know how many transaction\nlogs are waiting to be processed.\n\n452\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:40.510\nAnd down here I can pick if it's all\ntogether or one particular database.\n\n453\n00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.960\nLike I might just want to monitor\nthe Sales DB and that's it.\n\n454\n00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.090\nAnd then I can do copy queue\nlength excluding inspection.\n\n455\n00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.610\nWhat does that mean?\n\n456\n00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.380\nWell, these are logs that have been\ncopied to the other servers but\n\n457\n00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.630\nnot applied yet, right?\n\n458\n00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.360\nIt's part of that replay queue.\n\n459\n00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.730\nAnd so I can take that and\nadd that for Sales DB.\n\n460\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:01.350\nSo those are two good ones\nto keep an eye out for.\n\n461\n00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:07.000\nAnother one, one you'll want to alert on,\nis failed, right here, failed.\n\n462\n00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.920\nThat's one of those counters you\nwant to always show 0, right.\n\n463\n00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.150\nIf it ever shows 1 or higher, that means\nyou've got failed transaction logs and\n\n464\n00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.620\nyou need to find out why.\n\n465\n00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.530\nAnd so I might wanna add that one,\nall right now I've got a record of that.\n\n466\n00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.941\nSome of the other ones, there's some neat\nones here where Microsoft's really thought\n\n467\n00:23:21.941 --> 00:23:23.108\nof what we're going to need.\n\n468\n00:23:23.108 --> 00:23:26.496\nLike log replay is not keeping up.\n\n469\n00:23:26.496 --> 00:23:31.720\nOkay, any time the log replay on\nthe other side is getting behind,\n\n470\n00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.690\nthis will turn into a 1.\n\n471\n00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:34.670\nOtherwise, it will be a 0.\n\n472\n00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.910\nWhen it's a 0, you're healthy,\nwhen it's a 1, you've got a problem.\n\n473\n00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.890\nSo, easy counter to monitor, all right?\n\n474\n00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:45.060\nAlong the same lines, we've got log\ncopying is not keeping up, okay?\n\n475\n00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.422\nIf it's log copying,\nit's usually a network issue.\n\n476\n00:23:48.422 --> 00:23:52.184\nIf it's log replay,\nit's normally a server issue.\n\n477\n00:23:52.184 --> 00:23:55.766\nThis helps us to kinda dial down where to\ntroubleshoot to find out why replication\n\n478\n00:23:55.766 --> 00:23:56.780\nis behind.\n\n479\n00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.341\nOn the other side, all right?\n\n480\n00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:02.000\nAnd then, one more I'd like\nto add that's not in the GUI.\n\n481\n00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.660\nWe've got this copy queue length.\n\n482\n00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.120\nThere's a replay queue length also.\n\n483\n00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.720\nAnd we can spot that in here and\nadd that one in.\n\n484\n00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.240\nThese are all great counters\nto monitor for replication.\n\n485\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.430\nAnd with the exception of\nthe copy queue length,\n\n486\n00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.910\nI really do expect most of\nthese to be zero, right?\n\n487\n00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.070\nWe shouldn't have any giant delays,\nbut if it gets to one or\n\n488\n00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.220\ntwo, that might be okay for some of them.\n\n489\n00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.650\nIf the copy queue length, or\nthe replay queue length gets to two,\n\n490\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.720\nI'm okay with that, that's just two\nmegabytes of data that hasn't been rolled\n\n491\n00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.590\ninto the database yet,\nit's not that giant of a deal.\n\n492\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.310\nBut, if I see something like\nfailed go to 1, that's a big deal,\n\n493\n00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.200\nthat means I've got an actual failure.\n\n494\n00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:45.100\nOr log copying is not keeping up to date,\nif that gets to a 1, that's too much.\n\n495\n00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.860\nSo we need to understand the values\nof each, and if you ever forget\n\n496\n00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.550\nyou can highlight these things, and right\ndown here you can hit show description and\n\n497\n00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.280\nit'll explain what it's monitoring.\n\n498\n00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.370\nIt'll tell you a little bit about it and\nwhat to look for.\n\n499\n00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.460\nAnd when I say okay,\nit's gonna add all that together, and\n\n500\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.808\nnow I've got some great\ncounters here that are running.\n\n501\n00:25:01.808 --> 00:25:06.310\nAnd I could fire this up when I need\nit just on my own and monitor these, or\n\n502\n00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:10.400\nI could create a data collector set that\nhad these, and I could set it to run.\n\n503\n00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.860\nFor an hour during peak time.\n\n504\n00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.100\nI could set it run all the time.\n\n505\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:13.660\nIt's kind of up to me.\n\n506\n00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.660\nI could set it up to run whenever I\nneeded it and just let it do it's job and\n\n507\n00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.700\nthat's that, right?\n\n508\n00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.640\nSo great counters are available for\nus to get there.\n\n509\n00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.850\nNow, I do want to mention one thing.\n\n510\n00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.140\nIf you've got Microsoft Systems\nCenter Operations Manager, SCOM.\n\n511\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.190\nSCOM has an Exchange 2013 Management Pack.\n\n512\n00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.910\nAnd it knows about all this stuff too.\n\n513\n00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.760\nIt knows about it automatically.\n\n514\n00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.790\nNow, we can configure this ourselves\nright here in performance monitor.\n\n515\n00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.200\nIt doesn't cost us a dime.\n\n516\n00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.600\nSCOM costs money.\n\n517\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.900\nSo why would I want to go the SCOM route?\n\n518\n00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.110\nWell, SCOM already has\nthe stuff to find it.\n\n519\n00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.050\nAlready knows what's good and what's bad,\nso it knows when to throw an alert and\n\n520\n00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.050\nwhen not to.\n\n521\n00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.310\nAnd it can also monitor multiple servers.\n\n522\n00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.640\nThis, I'm just setting\nthis up on one server.\n\n523\n00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.520\nWell, I've got three\nexchange servers here.\n\n524\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.900\nSo I'll need to go to each exchange server\nthat I'm running replication on, and\n\n525\n00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.120\nconfigure these same counters and\nset up alerts.\n\n526\n00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.940\nThere's no way to centrally\nmanage the performance monitor.\n\n527\n00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.360\nSo instead, we can use SCOM and\nit makes our life a lot easier.\n\n528\n00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.950\nFor large environments,\nyou'll probably want SCOM.\n\n529\n00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.030\nFor a small environment,\n\n530\n00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.270\na couple of exchange servers where\nyou don't mind doing it by hand?\n\n531\n00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.970\nWell, you can use the performance monitor.\n\n532\n00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.110\nIt's right there,\nyou just have to know what to look for.\n\n533\n00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.380\nAll right, well those are the key\nthings to watch out for on replication.\n\n534\n00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.520\nWe're just keeping an eye on that copy\nqueue length and the replay queue length.\n\n535\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.010\nAnd if they start to get bigger,\n\n536\n00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.930\nthen we've got some issues\nwe need to troubleshoot.\n\n537\n00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:32.400\nKind of isolate where that problem is.\n\n538\n00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.013\nUsually boils down to network connectivity\nand Disk I/O on the destination side, or\n\n539\n00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:38.790\nmaybe CPU on the other side.\n\n540\n00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.210\nJust not being able to keep up\nwith the work that it's doing.\n\n541\n00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.195\nSo those are where we wanna target.\n\n542\n00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:47.060\nWell, replication is really only one\naspect of our exchange environment.\n\n543\n00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.990\nYou've also got your mailbox servers and\nyour client access servers.\n\n544\n00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:52.190\nWe need to monitor performance on those.\n\n545\n00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.400\nBut I'm a little short on time on this\nsegment, so what we're gonna do is do\n\n546\n00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.660\na Part Two, where we'll start to take a\nlook at just our general servers are, our\n\n547\n00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.770\nmailbox databases and our client access\nservers, what we need to watch for them,\n\n548\n00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:07.690\nhow we kinda monitor and maintain them and\nkeep their performance up to snuff.\n\n549\n00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.160\nSo definitely stay tuned for Part Two but\nin this episode, we got a chance to look\n\n550\n00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.000\nat monitoring replication, how to spot\nwhen there's a problem, and different ways\n\n551\n00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.110\nthat we can look to find that information\nand make sure that our server was healthy.\n\n552\n00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.550\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n553\n00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:27.285\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n554\n00:27:27.285 --> 00:27:32.260\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.966\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:20.501\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again with\nanother episode of Microsoft Exchange.\n\n5\n00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.660\nIn fact,\nthis is Part 2 to the Monitoring and\n\n6\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.950\nMaintenance episode that\nwe started filming earlier.\n\n7\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.300\nIn our last episode we had a chance\nto look at how to monitor replication\n\n8\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.080\non our system, and make sure that\nour servers were communicating and\n\n9\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.920\nthat our database availability groups\nare working the way their suppose to.\n\n10\n00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.840\nNow I wanna switch gears, and\n\n11\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.010\nwe're gonna just take a look at\nregular old Exchange Servers, right?\n\n12\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.220\nRegardless of whether we're doing\nreplication or not, there's certain\n\n13\n00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.230\nthings that we need to monitor on our\nservers to make sure that they're healthy.\n\n14\n00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.330\nAll right, now the first thing that I\nwanna mention before we even get into\n\n15\n00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.980\nmonitoring anything, is how important\nit is to have what's called a baseline.\n\n16\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.150\nAll right,\na baseline is a collection of data, right,\n\n17\n00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.610\ndata about your servers when\neverything's running fine.\n\n18\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.780\nSo you need to be sitting at your office\none day when all the exchange servers\n\n19\n00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.400\nare working great.\n\n20\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.530\nYou're not getting any support tickets,\nthings are running fine.\n\n21\n00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.890\nAnd take a snapshot of your servers,\na performance snapshot,\n\n22\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.230\nnot like a disk snapshot.\n\n23\n00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.616\nWe [LAUGH] need a performance snapshot so\n\n24\n00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:20.736\nwe know what things look\nlike when things are good.\n\n25\n00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:23.744\nHave you ever gotten the call\nfrom somebody, and they say, man,\n\n26\n00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:26.890\nmy email is really slow,\nwhat's going on over there?\n\n27\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.780\nAnd you look at it, and\nyou're like, well it's fine for me,\n\n28\n00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.060\nI don't see any problems, right?\n\n29\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.420\nWhat is slow?\n\n30\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.880\nDifferent people interpret\nslow in different ways.\n\n31\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.240\nAnd it could be their laptop, or\ntheir desktop is what's slow.\n\n32\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.010\nIt could be the servers that are slow.\n\n33\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.180\nIt could be that things are running like\nnormal, and they just feel like it's slow.\n\n34\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.087\nMaybe they're in a hurry,\nright, that's how I get.\n\n35\n00:01:47.087 --> 00:01:50.410\nIf I want to print the document,\nit prints at a certain speed, right?\n\n36\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.190\nBut if I'm in a hurry,\nif I need to get out the door,\n\n37\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.380\nthat print job takes forever.\n\n38\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.330\nIt really takes the same time,\nit's our own perception.\n\n39\n00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.970\nWe need something to\nbe able to compare to.\n\n40\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.640\nSo down the road when somebody calls and\nsays, man, email is really slow,\n\n41\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.070\nwe can gather our performance data for\nright now, compare it to our performance\n\n42\n00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.500\ndata from before, when things were good,\nand see if they're different.\n\n43\n00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.780\nIf they're the same, we can tell the\nperson, hey, I'm sorry, I don't know your\n\n44\n00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.730\nissue is, but the servers are running\nat their normal operating parameters.\n\n45\n00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.350\nOr we look at it and we see things are\ndifferent, we go wow, you're right, and\n\n46\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.530\nit looks like a server issue.\n\n47\n00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.450\nIt's not your laptop or your desktop,\nthere's something going on on our end.\n\n48\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.390\nLet me get in there and find it out.\n\n49\n00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.960\nThat's the advantage of having a baseline,\n\n50\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.060\nwe need to know what things\nare supposed to look like.\n\n51\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.880\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nshouldn't Microsoft give us a baseline,\n\n52\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.180\nlike here's what an exchange\nserver should run like?\n\n53\n00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.470\nUnfortunately everybody's implementation\nis a little bit different, right?\n\n54\n00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.300\nYou might have different hard\ndrives than somebody else.\n\n55\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.710\nSome hard drives are faster than others.\n\n56\n00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.380\nSome people might have SCSI drives,\nsome people might have iSCSI or\n\n57\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.840\nFiber Channel drives.\n\n58\n00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.110\nAnd there's different\nperformance characteristics.\n\n59\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.350\nSo you might have different RAID levels,\nright?\n\n60\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.580\nRAID 1 versus RAID 5, or whatever,\n\n61\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.290\neach of those has different\nread/write performance levels.\n\n62\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.349\nDifferent CPUs, different quantity of\nCPUs, these are all things that impact it.\n\n63\n00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.400\nBut one of the biggest things that impacts\nit are the size of your mailboxes and\n\n64\n00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.190\nhow many mailboxes you have.\n\n65\n00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.013\nThat can really impact\nperformance on your system.\n\n66\n00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:19.913\nAnd Microsoft doesn't know how many\nmailboxes you're gonna have so\n\n67\n00:03:19.913 --> 00:03:21.670\nthey can't give you just a fixed number.\n\n68\n00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.885\nThat's why it's important that\nyou take your own baseline.\n\n69\n00:03:24.885 --> 00:03:28.595\nWhat I'm gonna do this episode is I'm\ngonna go through a number of performance\n\n70\n00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:31.100\ncounters that we need\nto watch in our server.\n\n71\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.530\nSo that we have an idea\nof what to look for.\n\n72\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.573\nAnd then what you guys should do is take\nthis information and in real life land,\n\n73\n00:03:37.573 --> 00:03:41.190\nbuild up a Performance Monitor that\ncollects all this data when things\n\n74\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.760\nare good.\n\n75\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.087\nAnd then just save it, stick it somewhere\non your hard drive and save it.\n\n76\n00:03:45.087 --> 00:03:47.557\nAnd then down the road\nwhen problems happen,\n\n77\n00:03:47.557 --> 00:03:50.850\nyou can rerun these same counters and\ncompare the two.\n\n78\n00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.190\nAnd now you'll know if it's a server\nproblem, or a client problem, or\n\n79\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.550\nif there's no problem at all, right?\n\n80\n00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.360\nThat's what we get from this.\n\n81\n00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.970\nNow, there is a tool from Microsoft\nthat makes this a lot easier.\n\n82\n00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.915\nThere's a tool called the System\nCenter Operations Manager, SCOM.\n\n83\n00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:08.780\nSCOM has a Microsoft Exchange\n2013 management pack that\n\n84\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.010\nyou can install in it.\n\n85\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.150\nAnd that lets it know all\nthe characteristics of Exchange.\n\n86\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.240\nIt can start monitoring your servers and\nit'll see how many mailboxes you have and\n\n87\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.510\nit'll know what the average\nsize of those mailboxes are and\n\n88\n00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.610\nit'll know what your\nperformance should be.\n\n89\n00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.210\nAnd then it can alert you.\n\n90\n00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.160\nAnd so if you're running SCOM, it kinda\ntakes care of the baselines for you.\n\n91\n00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.050\nAnd it takes care of watching for\nerrors, it takes care of all that.\n\n92\n00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.280\nIt's really a great product,\nbut it's kind of expensive.\n\n93\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.450\nAnd you don't have to have SCOM.\n\n94\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.110\nSCOM's not really doing anything\nthat you couldn't do yourself with\n\n95\n00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.300\na Performance Monitor.\n\n96\n00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.990\nIt's just it takes a lot\nof work to do it yourself.\n\n97\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.470\nYou've gotta know exactly\nwhich counters to use, right?\n\n98\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.280\nSo the first part is knowledge.\n\n99\n00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.230\nThen you've gotta go and\nconfigure it all on your servers, and\n\n100\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.460\nthe more servers you have,\nthe more it's gonna take.\n\n101\n00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.240\nSo, the other thing SCOM gives\nus is centralized management.\n\n102\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.190\nAnd then lastly, you gotta set it up to be\nable to alert you when a problem happens\n\n103\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.790\nso you need to know what those alerts are.\n\n104\n00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.370\nSo the alerting threshold, that's kind\nof the third piece that SCOM gives you.\n\n105\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.400\nSo if you already have SCOM, or\nif it's in your budget to get it,\n\n106\n00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.450\nit's a great utility for\nmonitoring Exchange.\n\n107\n00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.370\nLike I said,\nwe don't actually have to have it,\n\n108\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.190\nyou can do the monitoring right\nin the Performance Monitor.\n\n109\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.760\nSo, let's walk through that process.\n\n110\n00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.190\nFirst off I'm gonna start with some kinda\ngeneral things, because you'll have\n\n111\n00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.530\ndifferent things you wanna monitor based\non whether it's a mailbox server or\n\n112\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.130\na client access server, right?\n\n113\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.570\nLet's kinda start there.\n\n114\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.610\nWhen we jump into our Performance Monitor,\nwe can go and set up Data Collector Sets.\n\n115\n00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.720\nAnd Data Collector Sets can\ncollect all sorts of information.\n\n116\n00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.930\nAnd when you install Exchange, it actually\ncreates a couple of these for you.\n\n117\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.020\nSo you'll see Exchange Diagnostics\nDaily Performance Log,\n\n118\n00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.350\nand Exchange Diagnostics Performance Log.\n\n119\n00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.250\nIt's actually doing its own\ndiagnostics in the background, and\n\n120\n00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.098\nit'll alert you to various things.\n\n121\n00:05:52.098 --> 00:05:55.620\nIt's not all-encompassing though, so\nyou don't want to rely on just that.\n\n122\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.300\nBut you can create your own\nuser-defined Data Collector Set, and\n\n123\n00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.020\ndefine all the things I'm gonna\ntalk about in this episode.\n\n124\n00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.600\nAnd then use those as a test to\nbe able to see how your server's\n\n125\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.590\ndoing at any given point, right?\n\n126\n00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.765\nNow the server we monitor is gonna\nmake a difference, for example,\n\n127\n00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:14.825\nif it's a client access server.\n\n128\n00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:17.340\nWe have to think what a client\naccess server does, right.\n\n129\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.320\nEnd users browse to its web pages, or\nthey use POP3 and IMAP4 to go through it,\n\n130\n00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.320\nor SMTP email is moved through\nthe queues on a client access server.\n\n131\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.780\nBut a client access server has\nno mailboxes, zero mailboxes.\n\n132\n00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.110\nIt has no queues to speak of, so\nemail is not getting queued there.\n\n133\n00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.700\nSo disk I/O on a client access\nserver is almost nonexistent,\n\n134\n00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.080\nit really doesn't do a lot of disk I/O.\n\n135\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.470\nAnd it really doesn't\nconsume a lot of RAM either,\n\n136\n00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.650\nstuff is just passing right through it.\n\n137\n00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.330\nIt's mostly CPU, and maybe some network,\nbut mostly CPU on a client access server.\n\n138\n00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.980\nA mailbox server is very different though,\na mailbox server has a huge database.\n\n139\n00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.990\nAnd the database is stored on the hard\ndrive and it's constantly reading and\n\n140\n00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.150\nwriting from that database.\n\n141\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.060\nAnd it's got transaction logs and\nother things, it's got email queues.\n\n142\n00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.590\nAll of that is gonna generate disk I/O.\n\n143\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.280\nAnd so we have something\ndifferent we want to focus on.\n\n144\n00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.960\nAnd to try and alleviate the disk I/O, a\nlot of the database gets cached into RAM,\n\n145\n00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.780\nand so\nmailbox servers consume a lot of RAM too.\n\n146\n00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.580\nThey do use some CPU, but\nnot like client access server.\n\n147\n00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.780\nSo, the performance profiles\nof your different servers\n\n148\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.090\nare actually gonna be\ndifferent based on their role.\n\n149\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.120\nSo keep that in mind,\nI'll mention as we go through.\n\n150\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.290\nBut let's start with one that we need\nto monitor pretty much everywhere,\n\n151\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.630\nand that's processor.\n\n152\n00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.980\nWhen you launch the Performance Monitor\nit has one performance counter added by\n\n153\n00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.770\ndefault which is CPU, and\nit's percent processor time right?\n\n154\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.720\nNow what percent processor time is,\n\n155\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.250\nis the amount of time the CPU\nspends actually doing something.\n\n156\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.610\nA lot of times your CPU is idle, right?\n\n157\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.348\nAnd even when it's busy it's\nnot 100% busy, it's 70% busy.\n\n158\n00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:57.130\nWell, if it's 70% busy,\nthat means it's 30% idle.\n\n159\n00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.230\nI've got available resources, right?\n\n160\n00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.146\nSo that's what percent\nprocessor time measures,\n\n161\n00:08:02.146 --> 00:08:06.160\nis how much time the processor is\nactually occupied doing something.\n\n162\n00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.788\nAnd if it's pegged out all of the time,\nour server might be running slower than it\n\n163\n00:08:10.788 --> 00:08:14.000\nshould be because we've\nexceeded what that CPU can do.\n\n164\n00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.860\nAnd you might need to go to multiple\nCPUs or higher cores or faster CPUs,\n\n165\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.680\nor whatever.\n\n166\n00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.790\nBut at a minimum,\nyou know that there is an issue.\n\n167\n00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.950\nNow, we need to monitor the CPU on both\nmailbox and client access servers, right?\n\n168\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.400\nIt's important on both sides.\n\n169\n00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.480\nBut on a client access server especially.\n\n170\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.420\nThat is where a lot of your\nprocessor intensive work happens.\n\n171\n00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.520\nSo that's one that we definitely\nwant to keep track of.\n\n172\n00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.852\nA few other things in addition to that.\n\n173\n00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:42.989\nThere's another counter called\nthe processor queue length.\n\n174\n00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.897\nAnd the processor queue length,\n\n175\n00:08:44.897 --> 00:08:49.640\nthat is basically how many programs\nare waiting in line to get to your CPU.\n\n176\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.890\nNow modern CPUs are fast.\n\n177\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.930\nThey do millions of operations per second.\n\n178\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.720\nThey are really impressively fast.\n\n179\n00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.190\nBut they get busy and\nsometimes you have to wait.\n\n180\n00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.210\nAnd so, if I add in this other category.\n\n181\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:06.390\nI'm just gonna go in to Add Counters and\nI'm gonna find the Processor section.\n\n182\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.540\nSo I'm looking for\nnot Process but Processor.\n\n183\n00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.528\nThere we go.\n\n184\n00:09:11.528 --> 00:09:17.270\nAnd inside a Processor we can find in\nhere the Processor Queue Length and\n\n185\n00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.820\noh sorry,\nthis one's actually not under processor.\n\n186\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.138\nIt's one of that they kind of moved off.\n\n187\n00:09:21.138 --> 00:09:22.690\nI was wondering why it wasn't there.\n\n188\n00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.040\nIf we go and find system.\n\n189\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.870\nThere we go.\n\n190\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.110\nIf you're in the processor queue it means\nyou haven't gotten to the processor yet.\n\n191\n00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.482\nSo that's why it's not under\nthe processor section, and\n\n192\n00:09:31.482 --> 00:09:33.140\nso we have to find it under system.\n\n193\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.140\nIt's not necessarily intuitive,\nbut it does make some sense.\n\n194\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.600\nAnd if we go under system, we'll find that\nprocessor queue length and there it is.\n\n195\n00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.730\nProcessor queue length.\n\n196\n00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.010\nSo this is how many programs are waiting\nin line to get to the processor.\n\n197\n00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:51.520\nNow remember, when I went to [LAUGH]\npercent processor time, when we went\n\n198\n00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.980\nthere, it actually let me pick\nindividual cores if I wanted to, right?\n\n199\n00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.350\nBut here I can't and the reason is\nthese haven't made it to the CPU.\n\n200\n00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.040\nThey don't care what core they go to,\nthey're just waiting for\n\n201\n00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.980\nsome core to open up somewhere, right?\n\n202\n00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.030\nAnd that's this processor queue length.\n\n203\n00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.530\nAs a rule of thumb, Microsoft says\nthis number should not be above 10 for\n\n204\n00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.570\nany length of time.\n\n205\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.470\nAll right?\n\n206\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.010\nExpect to see some pop in here.\n\n207\n00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.200\nThere's always gonna be programs waiting\nfor that chance to get to the CPU.\n\n208\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.700\nBut if it's over ten for\na consistent period of time\n\n209\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.380\nthat usually indicates that\nyour processor is saturated.\n\n210\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.470\nThat you need more cores, or\nyou need more physical CPUs, or\n\n211\n00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.550\nyou need to just add more\nclient access servers and\n\n212\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:34.650\nstart distributing your load and take\nsome of the pressure off of this server.\n\n213\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.190\nAll right.\n\n214\n00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.940\nOn a client access server,\nthis is a really important one to watch.\n\n215\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.060\nOn a mailbox server, it's still important.\n\n216\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.350\nRight, it's not unimportant.\n\n217\n00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.510\nBut it's less likely that you'll see\nthis thing pegged out, all right.\n\n218\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.200\nSo that's kind of the CPU side.\n\n219\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.720\nAnd I'm working this from the angle of,\nwhen you monitor a server,\n\n220\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.220\nthere's the big four, right.\n\n221\n00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.980\nCPU, memory, disk, network, right.\n\n222\n00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.080\nSo on the CPU side, those are the two\ncounters that are really handy.\n\n223\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.190\nOn the memory side,\n\n224\n00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.290\nwe actually have quite a few different\ncounters that we can look for.\n\n225\n00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.740\nOn the memory side, I'm not really worried\n\n226\n00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.290\nif my Exchange Server is running\nat 100% memory consumption.\n\n227\n00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.000\nA lot of people freak out about that,\nright?\n\n228\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.360\nIf you have 32 gigs of RAM in your mailbox\nserver, and it's using 31 gigs of RAM.\n\n229\n00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.100\nIs that freak out time?\n\n230\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:19.710\nMaybe.\n\n231\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.690\nFor some people it is,\nfor some people it isn't.\n\n232\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.560\nFor me, I look at it and I say, wow,\nthat server's using its resources wisely.\n\n233\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.100\nRight?\n\n234\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.380\nCaches much data into RAM as you can so\nyou never have to go to the hard drive.\n\n235\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.140\nI love it.\n\n236\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:30.880\nAll right.\n\n237\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.660\nSo the only time you really have\na problem is when you're using\n\n238\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.610\nmore memory than you have.\n\n239\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.130\nI know I've got 32 gigs\nof physical memory, and\n\n240\n00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.860\nI'm using 36 gigs of memory, okay?\n\n241\n00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.070\nHow did it magically\ncreate those four gigs?\n\n242\n00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.080\nWell, it's not magic,\nit's using your hard drive, right?\n\n243\n00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.220\nIt's swapping to a page\nfile on the hard drive.\n\n244\n00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.440\nUnfortunately when you measure the speed\nof memory you measure it in nanoseconds.\n\n245\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.210\nWhen you measure the speed of hard\ndrives you measure it in milliseconds.\n\n246\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.200\nHard drives are significantly\nslower than memory.\n\n247\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.780\nAnd so that's a problem.\n\n248\n00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.770\nThat means when we're using the hard\ndrive as memory, we're using slow memory.\n\n249\n00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.870\nSo I don't necessarily care\nhow much memory I am using.\n\n250\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.440\nWhat I care about is whether I'm paging or\nnot.\n\n251\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.800\nI want to know if I am hitting a page\nfile, if I'm hitting the hard drive.\n\n252\n00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.840\nIf I'm hitting the hard\ndrive that's a problem.\n\n253\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.738\nI need to add more memory, all right.\n\n254\n00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:23.910\nBut if I'm not using the hard drive and\nI'm running it 95% memory utilization,\n\n255\n00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.890\nI'm actually okay with that as long\nas I'm not using the hard drive.\n\n256\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.070\nNow if I'm anticipating\nspikes down the road,\n\n257\n00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.040\nI might want to go ahead\nan upgrade anyway.\n\n258\n00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.660\nBut it's not like urgent red light,\nlet's get some memory right now.\n\n259\n00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.210\nI can take my time.\n\n260\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.460\nBut we just want to make sure\nwe're not paging the hard drive.\n\n261\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.060\nSo that's really what\nwe want to watch for.\n\n262\n00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.320\nAnd an easy way to spot that is\na neat little counter we can pull.\n\n263\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.490\nIt's under the memory section.\n\n264\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.490\nLet me go here and find memory.\n\n265\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.680\nAnd notice these.\n\n266\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.430\nI'm not looking for\nthese under the exchange section.\n\n267\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.910\nThese are pretty standard across\nany server implementation, right?\n\n268\n00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.400\nSo if you've got a file server,\n\n269\n00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.030\na domain controller, whatever,\na lot of these can be monitored too.\n\n270\n00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:06.310\nThe counter I'm looking for is page reads\nand we'll find it in here somewhere.\n\n271\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.090\nWhich is, let's see Page.\n\n272\n00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.750\nI will find it.\n\n273\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.750\nThere it is.\nPage reads per second.\n\n274\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.060\nWhat is a page read?\n\n275\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.660\nA page read is when I look to RAM for\nsomething and it wasn't there and\n\n276\n00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.310\nI had to go to the hard drive for it.\n\n277\n00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.560\nHaving a page file is not a bad thing.\n\n278\n00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.090\nEvery server has a page file unless\nyou've turned it off yourself.\n\n279\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.400\nWhich is somewhat dangerous.\n\n280\n00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.170\nEverybody's got a page file.\n\n281\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.940\nBut, it doesn't you're using it.\n\n282\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.850\nBut if you get reads on the page file,\nthat means you're using it,\n\n283\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.120\nyou're actually using it.\n\n284\n00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.230\nThis is a great way to see whether\nyou're paging the disk and\n\n285\n00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.900\nif you see this counter registering\na high quantity of numbers for\n\n286\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.250\nany period of time, that means you were\nreading from a high drive that whole time\n\n287\n00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.900\nand your server was running\nslower than it should.\n\n288\n00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.770\nSo that's a great one to monitor.\n\n289\n00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.250\nDefinitely monitor this\none on a mailbox server.\n\n290\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.390\nOn a client access server,\nit's not so important.\n\n291\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.590\nClient access servers they\nuse a lot of CPU ram.\n\n292\n00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.290\nThey don't do too crazy on, but they can.\n\n293\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.900\nRight?\nThey run IAS.\n\n294\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.980\nAnd IAS creates these workerflows, for\n\n295\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.790\neverybody that opens up sessions\nthrough the client access server.\n\n296\n00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:17.370\nSo if the server gets overwhelmed, it can\ncreate too many of these worker processes.\n\n297\n00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.160\nAnd it ends up eating up the RAM, and\nstarting to write to hard drive and\n\n298\n00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.140\ngetting slow there too.\n\n299\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.930\nAnd so you can add more client\naccess servers to alleviate that.\n\n300\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.960\nBut it's definitely important\non a mailbox server.\n\n301\n00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.300\nAll right, now I could stop there.\n\n302\n00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.560\nThat's usually the one that I look for.\n\n303\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.640\nBut we could jump for a few other things.\n\n304\n00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.740\nFor example, right here under\nmemory there's pages output.\n\n305\n00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:42.040\nAnd pages output per second,\nlet's see if we can find that one.\n\n306\n00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.650\nPages output per second, there we go.\n\n307\n00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.790\nThat is when your system takes data from\nRAM and writes it to the hard drive.\n\n308\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.590\nSo I've got some data in RAM\nthat hasn't been used for\n\n309\n00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:56.270\na few moments, but it's been used recent\nenough that I still want it ready.\n\n310\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.822\nSo we write it to the page file.\n\n311\n00:14:57.822 --> 00:15:00.180\nAll right, this is when we put\nthings into the page file.\n\n312\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.230\nNow, I'm not so worried about\nputting things into the page file,\n\n313\n00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.130\nbecause it's the system writing it,\nthe end users don't see that.\n\n314\n00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.930\nI'm really worried about when I\nretrieve data from the page file,\n\n315\n00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.430\nthat's when we see slowness.\n\n316\n00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.380\nSo, you don't necessarily need to monitor\nboth, but just remember this one's there.\n\n317\n00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.908\nIf you wanna catch when you're server\nwrites something to that page file,\n\n318\n00:15:17.908 --> 00:15:19.766\nPage outputs per second's a good one.\n\n319\n00:15:19.766 --> 00:15:22.052\nAll right.\n\n320\n00:15:22.052 --> 00:15:24.340\nDisk I/O.\n\n321\n00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.600\nOn a mailbox server, disk I/O is nine\ntimes out of ten your bottleneck.\n\n322\n00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.020\nRight?\nIf you look at a server, processor,\n\n323\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.960\nmemory, network, hard drive.\n\n324\n00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.590\nHard drive is typically the slowest\ncomponent in your system.\n\n325\n00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.640\nSSDs are changing that, but\nif you're on traditional spinning media,\n\n326\n00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.630\nyour hard drives are usually\nthe slowest device in your system.\n\n327\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.760\nSo when our exchange server\nsees me running slow,\n\n328\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.690\nit's not normally\nthe client access server.\n\n329\n00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.480\nIt could if the CPU is pegged\ndown on the client access server.\n\n330\n00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.079\nBut more often than not, the client\naccess server is just turning around and\n\n331\n00:15:53.079 --> 00:15:54.102\naccessing a mailbox server.\n\n332\n00:15:54.102 --> 00:15:57.049\nAnd if the mailbox server has\nover saturated its' disks,\n\n333\n00:15:57.049 --> 00:16:00.961\nif it's reaching across a scuzzy\ncontroller or fiber channel controller and\n\n334\n00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:04.992\nit's just used all of the available\nbandwidth Then, it's gonna wait and now,\n\n335\n00:16:04.992 --> 00:16:06.884\nit's taking time to get to the disk.\n\n336\n00:16:06.884 --> 00:16:09.330\nAnd so, we've got a couple\nof good counters for this.\n\n337\n00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.800\nOn a mailbox server,\nthese are really a must.\n\n338\n00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.020\nThe number one counter\nthat we need to watch for\n\n339\n00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.980\nis what's called the disk queue length.\n\n340\n00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.810\nI talk about the process of queue length\nfor programs that are waiting in line to\n\n341\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.460\nget to the CPU,\ndisk queue length is the same thing.\n\n342\n00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.870\nThe number of programs waiting\nin line to get to the disk.\n\n343\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.500\nBut this one is a little bit trickier,\nright?\n\n344\n00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.160\nI'm gonna go to the physical disk section.\n\n345\n00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.620\nLet me just find that in\nhere probably in the ps.\n\n346\n00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.060\nSo I'll find physical disk.\n\n347\n00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.130\nAnd under physical disk,\n\n348\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.700\nI'll find that disk queue length\ncounter in it here somewhere.\n\n349\n00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.860\nAnd it is, let's see,\nit's average, disk queue length.\n\n350\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.850\nAverage disk queue length.\n\n351\n00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.620\nIf you just choose it and add it in, the\nnumber it gives you is not very useful and\n\n352\n00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.150\nthat's because it's rolling\nall your disks together.\n\n353\n00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.960\nYou really need to monitor\nyour disks individually,\n\n354\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.430\nbecause you'll probably have an operating\nsystem disk, a page file disk,\n\n355\n00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.560\na transaction log disk and\na mailbox database disk.\n\n356\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.670\nRight?\nYou'll likely have four separate disks.\n\n357\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.070\nAnd those disks might\nactually be RAID arrays.\n\n358\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:14.860\nSo your operating system,\nyour page file and your transaction logs,\n\n359\n00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.300\nthose might all be RAID 1 mirrors.\n\n360\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.100\nRight?\n\n361\n00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.180\nBut then your mailbox database might be\nRAID 5 or RAID 10, different type of RAID.\n\n362\n00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.650\nIt just depends on how well you wanted\nto tune the performance on the system.\n\n363\n00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.310\nSo when we monitor these,\nthe disk queue length is affected by that.\n\n364\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.960\nThe disk queue length is based on\n\n365\n00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.120\nhow many programs are waiting\nto get to the hard drive, right?\n\n366\n00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.690\nTo write or read from the hard drive.\n\n367\n00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.380\nA traditional spinning media has a little\nmechanical arm that moves around on it.\n\n368\n00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.320\nAnd the arm can only be\nin one place at a time.\n\n369\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.130\nSo it can only do one thing at a time.\n\n370\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:51.680\nIf I've got a single drive, and it's doing\none operation, everybody else has to wait.\n\n371\n00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.570\nBut what if I have a RAID 5 array?\n\n372\n00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.190\nAnd my RAID 5 array has 6 drives in it.\n\n373\n00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.690\nWell, we'll chalk one of\nthose drives up to parody.\n\n374\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.390\nAnd in the other five drives, technically,\n\n375\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.440\nI have five heads that can all\nbe reading at the same time.\n\n376\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.660\nI can be doing five things at once.\n\n377\n00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.100\nIt doesn't really work at that way.\n\n378\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.770\nBecause you take one operation,\nand you spread it across all five.\n\n379\n00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.940\nBut it means they get\ndone five times faster.\n\n380\n00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.340\nSo, Microsoft's rule of thumb on this one,\nwhen you're monitoring your disk queuing,\n\n381\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.700\nmonitor your disks individually, so\nyou might have a C, D, E, and F drive.\n\n382\n00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.740\nMonitor them individually and\n\n383\n00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.620\nthen what you're looking for is the number\nshould really never be above 2.\n\n384\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:35.080\nYou never wanna see more than two programs\nwaiting in line, for a single disk.\n\n385\n00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:40.050\nThat means if it's a RAID five array with\nsix discs, take one out for parody right\n\n386\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.860\nand so you've got five disks left,\nyou need to multiply five by two so ten.\n\n387\n00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.600\nAnd the way Microsoft always phrases it is\n\n388\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.320\ntwo times the number of\nspindles in the disc.\n\n389\n00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.240\nAnd this really applies to SSD\nalso although SSD can do some\n\n390\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.700\ncool things where it can write to\nmore than one place at the same time.\n\n391\n00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.450\nIf you have dual channel stuff\nit can really get kind of crazy.\n\n392\n00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.490\nBut, the basic rule of thumb, you don't\nwant to see this queue get above two for\n\n393\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.250\neach individual physical\ndisc that you've got.\n\n394\n00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.200\nSo keep that in mind, this number is gonna\nbe a little bit different based on your\n\n395\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.839\nphysical architecture behind the scenes.\n\n396\n00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:17.460\nNow that's the one I normally watch for.\n\n397\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.950\nI'm not normally concerned\nabout how fast or\n\n398\n00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.120\nhow slow the disk is,\nas long as I don't have rights piling up.\n\n399\n00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.470\nAnd the disk queue length shows\nyou when things are piling up,\n\n400\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.310\nthat's when you know you've got a problem.\n\n401\n00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.710\nBut we might be concerned about speed,\nright?\n\n402\n00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.020\nI might want to know how\nfast my reads are happening,\n\n403\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.200\nhow fast my writes are happening.\n\n404\n00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.150\nAnd so we can spot that too, there's\nperformance counters buried in here.\n\n405\n00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.210\nI'm gonna add this queue length and then\nI'm gonna look for two other ones here.\n\n406\n00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:45.350\nYou'll find the average disk read and\naverage disk writes per second.\n\n407\n00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.280\nThey're up toward the top of this one.\n\n408\n00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:53.390\nAverage disk reads per second and\nwrites per second.\n\n409\n00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.600\nThese two guys right here.\n\n410\n00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.370\nSo if I want to see how much\nactivity is happening on the system.\n\n411\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.010\nHow many reads am I doing per second?\n\n412\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.730\nHow many writes am I doing per second?\n\n413\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.610\nNow I can monitor how active those drives\nare, and I can get a chance to see that.\n\n414\n00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.690\nAnd you can monitor\nthe write queue length and\n\n415\n00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.540\nthe read queue length separately\nif you wanna address it that way.\n\n416\n00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.430\nI don't normally worry about that,\nbut you can.\n\n417\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:16.050\nSo you can really get into the nitty\ngritty details of that system.\n\n418\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.400\nOn a client access server,\n\n419\n00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.910\nyou might choose to ignore\nthis performance altogether.\n\n420\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.320\nBut on a mailbox server, you really gotta\nmonitor this one, it's really important.\n\n421\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:29.550\nAll right, now if you see a high\nqueue length, what does it mean?\n\n422\n00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.100\nI mentioned when you have the CPU,\nthe processor queue length,\n\n423\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.210\nwhen it's really high,\nyou need more processors.\n\n424\n00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.770\nEither more cores or more CPUs.\n\n425\n00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.290\nOr you can roll out more servers and\nspread your clients out.\n\n426\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.960\nWith a client access server, that's easy.\n\n427\n00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.570\nAdd more client access servers.\n\n428\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.310\nOn a mailbox server, it's a little harder.\n\n429\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:49.750\nYou need to add more mailbox databases and\nspread your mailboxes out.\n\n430\n00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.330\nWhat about disk queue length?\n\n431\n00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.330\nWell, disk queue length, if it starts\nto add up, it's gonna be one of.\n\n432\n00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.700\nWell, it's a number of causes but\nthere's really only two solutions.\n\n433\n00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.300\nSolution one is to add more discs.\n\n434\n00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.520\nIf it's a RAID five array with six discs,\nI'll put up to ten discs.\n\n435\n00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.700\nYou're adding more spindles.\n\n436\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.280\nMore spindles means it can\ndo more operations at once.\n\n437\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.980\nIt can get more work done.\n\n438\n00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.900\nThe more discs in your array the better.\n\n439\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:17.470\nA lot of people don't realize that, that\nif you have a RAID five array with three,\n\n440\n00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:22.320\nthree terabyte drives versus a RAID\nfive well, three terabytes job, right?\n\n441\n00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.060\nThat's be what, nine terabytes.\n\n442\n00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.070\nOr if I had five two terabyte drives.\n\n443\n00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.000\nThat would be ten terabytes.\n\n444\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.990\nWell the five two terabyte drives will\nactually perform better than the three\n\n445\n00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:36.360\nthree terabyte drives cuz I've got\nfive spindles as opposed to three.\n\n446\n00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.170\nBetter performance.\n\n447\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:37.930\nRight?\nThese are things that we\n\n448\n00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.240\ncan kinda look for.\n\n449\n00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.460\nSo that's solution one.\n\n450\n00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.500\nYou throw more disks at it.\n\n451\n00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.480\nSolution two is to either\nupgrade our storage,\n\n452\n00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.490\ngo from scuzzy to fiber channel,\nor to 10k drives to 15k drives.\n\n453\n00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.840\nWhatever it is to get faster architecture.\n\n454\n00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.440\nYou'll see this with IScuzzy a lot.\n\n455\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.430\nPeople think IScuzzy is great.\n\n456\n00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.990\nWell, at the end of the day\nIScuzzy really sucks, and\n\n457\n00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.430\nit just doesn't give you good performance.\n\n458\n00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:09.105\nSo, IScuzzy is fine for\nnon critical things, but for\n\n459\n00:22:09.105 --> 00:22:12.330\na mailbox server IScuzzy\nis throttling you.\n\n460\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.670\nYou end up with this bottleneck.\n\n461\n00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.340\nIt's really bad.\n\n462\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:19.240\nAnd you'll see the queue length start\nto go up for it because of just nature.\n\n463\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.290\nBut if you move to fiber channel,\nyou move to direct attached SCSI,\n\n464\n00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.580\nyou're gonna get a huge\nperformance increase over that.\n\n465\n00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.900\nThe other option would be to add more\nthan one mailbox database server,\n\n466\n00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.530\ncreate more than one mailbox database,\nand spread your mailboxes over it.\n\n467\n00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.580\nOr you could even just have one server and\njust add more storage that was separate.\n\n468\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.420\nSo you've got database one\non one set of drives and\n\n469\n00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.870\ndatabase two on a second set of\nhard drives and spread your users.\n\n470\n00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:46.150\nBe careful if you do that though,\nbecause if you're using a shared storage\n\n471\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.580\ncontroller you might\nstill have contention.\n\n472\n00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.853\nSo ideally you'd have two separate storage\ncontrollers tied to these separate banks\n\n473\n00:22:51.853 --> 00:22:53.671\nof drives, and\nthat starts to get expensive and\n\n474\n00:22:53.671 --> 00:22:55.635\nyou might as well add\nanother server at that point.\n\n475\n00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:57.180\nIt's kind of a tough decision.\n\n476\n00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:04.300\nAll right, let's see that was I gotta\nkeep track of this, CPU Memory Network.\n\n477\n00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.690\nWell no, I left off network,\nshoot, CPU Memory Disk,\n\n478\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:08.770\nthat's what we talked about so far.\n\n479\n00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:09.870\nLet's talk about Network now right?\n\n480\n00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:14.210\nNetwork's important, on the Network side\nwe usually just care about bandwidth it's\n\n481\n00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:17.140\nreally easy, you got a network adaptor in\nyour system you monitor it's bandwidth and\n\n482\n00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.160\nyou're done right?\n\n483\n00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.620\nIf I've got a gigabit card, and I see I'm\nrunning at 100% utilization all the time,\n\n484\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.310\nI've got a problem.\n\n485\n00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.340\nI need to add more bandwidth, I could add\nanother gig card and bond them together or\n\n486\n00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.250\nbump up to a ten gig card, go crazy,\nall sorts of options that are out there.\n\n487\n00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.380\nBut we need to have a handle\non whether that's occurring.\n\n488\n00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:39.030\nSo you can jump to the network section,\nso let me just find network in here\n\n489\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:45.310\nAnd we can jump into our network adapter,\nour network interface.\n\n490\n00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.930\nNow, why two separate values, right?\n\n491\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.120\nWell, usually a network adapter just\nhas one interface on it, right?\n\n492\n00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.770\nBut in most servers today\nyou get those dual mix,\n\n493\n00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.210\nwhere you have two interfaces\non the same adapter.\n\n494\n00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.851\nAnd so that's why we have\nthese separate entities.\n\n495\n00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:02.010\nOne's the adaptor itself,\nwhere you've got like a PCI bus and\n\n496\n00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.511\na TCP offload engine that\nyou have to deal with.\n\n497\n00:24:04.511 --> 00:24:07.661\nAnd then the other ones,\nthe actual interface itself.\n\n498\n00:24:07.661 --> 00:24:10.816\nNow which one should we monitor,\ncuz they have the same counters?\n\n499\n00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:12.858\nIt depends.\n\n500\n00:24:12.858 --> 00:24:15.220\nIf it's an expensive card,\nwhich in a server,\n\n501\n00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.653\nyou are usually going to\nuse the expensive ones.\n\n502\n00:24:17.653 --> 00:24:19.197\nYou might have two interfaces and\n\n503\n00:24:19.197 --> 00:24:22.296\nthey have two completely separate\ncontrollers on that one board.\n\n504\n00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:26.708\nAnd so in that scenario,\nyou'd really wanna monitor the interface.\n\n505\n00:24:26.708 --> 00:24:30.350\nBut if it's a cheap dual interface card,\nthere's some companies that make them and\n\n506\n00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.388\nthey cost like $50.\n\n507\n00:24:31.388 --> 00:24:35.375\nIf you've got one of those,\nthere's probably only one controller for\n\n508\n00:24:35.375 --> 00:24:36.577\nthe two interfaces.\n\n509\n00:24:36.577 --> 00:24:38.919\nAnd so\nat that point if you monitor an interface,\n\n510\n00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:42.591\nyou're not getting real data,\nyou need to monitor the controller itself.\n\n511\n00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:44.351\nSo that's why we've got\nthose two entities and\n\n512\n00:24:44.351 --> 00:24:46.074\nyou need to make sure you\nchoose the right one.\n\n513\n00:24:46.074 --> 00:24:49.499\nBut if you've got like Intel mix or\nBroadcom, they do a great job\n\n514\n00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:53.686\nof providing optimized controllers for\neach interface and so you'll wanna go\n\n515\n00:24:53.686 --> 00:24:57.949\nwith network interface and you can just\nmonitor bytes received and bytes sent.\n\n516\n00:24:57.949 --> 00:24:59.889\nThose are really the two we wanna monitor.\n\n517\n00:24:59.889 --> 00:25:04.173\nI know a lot of people monitor bytes\ntotal, but if you've got a gig card,\n\n518\n00:25:04.173 --> 00:25:05.728\na gig card is full duplex.\n\n519\n00:25:05.728 --> 00:25:10.187\nSo you've got 1 gig in and\n1 gig out simultaneous.\n\n520\n00:25:10.187 --> 00:25:12.009\nSo if you're monitoring bytes total,\n\n521\n00:25:12.009 --> 00:25:14.989\nyou might see that you're running\nat a gigabyte of bandwidth and\n\n522\n00:25:14.989 --> 00:25:19.630\nthink that you're out of bandwidth when\nin actuality you're only halfway there.\n\n523\n00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.631\nSo it's a better idea to monitor\nthem separately, received and sent.\n\n524\n00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:26.296\nIf you've got a gigabyte\ncard that's full duplex,\n\n525\n00:25:26.296 --> 00:25:29.627\nyou can receive a gig of data while\nyou're sending a gig of data and\n\n526\n00:25:29.627 --> 00:25:32.674\nyou'll be fine that gives you\na more clear understanding.\n\n527\n00:25:32.674 --> 00:25:34.636\nIt also helps you with\nthe troubleshooting.\n\n528\n00:25:34.636 --> 00:25:37.273\nAm I receiving a gig of data?\n\n529\n00:25:37.273 --> 00:25:41.612\nThat's pretty difficult to do with email\nto have a gigabyte of email coming in\n\n530\n00:25:41.612 --> 00:25:43.693\nper second, that's pretty tough.\n\n531\n00:25:43.693 --> 00:25:49.172\nI'm sorry, a gigabit let me use my right\nterm or no, actually, this is bytes shoot.\n\n532\n00:25:49.172 --> 00:25:51.332\nSo it is gigabytes, there we go.\n\n533\n00:25:51.332 --> 00:25:54.837\nTo have a gigabyte of data going\nout though, that's not uncommon.\n\n534\n00:25:54.837 --> 00:25:57.660\nIf I have a bunch of clients connected and\nthey're all checking their email,\n\n535\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.757\nthey're all downloading attachments,\nI could be pushing out all that bandwidth.\n\n536\n00:26:00.757 --> 00:26:02.847\nSo we wanna make sure we monitor those.\n\n537\n00:26:02.847 --> 00:26:06.092\nDefinitely a good one to kinda keep an eye\non and then down here at the bottom,\n\n538\n00:26:06.092 --> 00:26:08.189\nyou can choose the adapter\nyou're monitoring.\n\n539\n00:26:08.189 --> 00:26:14.456\nSo I'll monitor my Intel NIC And I'll add\nthose in, so I'm monitoring those too.\n\n540\n00:26:14.456 --> 00:26:17.485\nNow everything that I've talked about so\n\n541\n00:26:17.485 --> 00:26:21.214\nfar, really could apply\nto any Microsoft server.\n\n542\n00:26:21.214 --> 00:26:23.930\nIt could apply to a domain controller,\na file server, whatever.\n\n543\n00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:28.873\nThese are the big four, the things that we\nneed to monitor, but there's another set\n\n544\n00:26:28.873 --> 00:26:33.346\nof counters that I like to monitor that\nI call my client experience monitor.\n\n545\n00:26:33.346 --> 00:26:35.110\nClient experience, what is that?\n\n546\n00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.806\nIf I fire up Outlook and I wanna open up\nmy email, it's gotta connect to a client\n\n547\n00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:42.502\naccess server, the client access server\nhas to connect to a mailbox server and\n\n548\n00:26:42.502 --> 00:26:45.000\nthen render my email and get it to me.\n\n549\n00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.253\nHow long does that take?\n\n550\n00:26:46.253 --> 00:26:47.776\nThat's client experience.\n\n551\n00:26:47.776 --> 00:26:50.038\nAnd client experience,\nin this case is a little bit unique.\n\n552\n00:26:50.038 --> 00:26:54.907\nIt's different than a file server or\na web server, an Active Directory domain\n\n553\n00:26:54.907 --> 00:26:59.554\ncontroller, it's different than those\nguys and so we have a special set of\n\n554\n00:26:59.554 --> 00:27:04.016\ncounters that are really useful to\nmonitor for just Exchange servers.\n\n555\n00:27:04.016 --> 00:27:07.497\nBut as far as everything else,\nthese guys right here.\n\n556\n00:27:07.497 --> 00:27:13.512\nThis is kind of our big four,\nCPU, memory, disk, network.\n\n557\n00:27:13.512 --> 00:27:18.307\nYou wanna make sure you're monitoring\nthose and know what your good days are, so\n\n558\n00:27:18.307 --> 00:27:21.988\nyou can then compare those to\na bad day and see the difference.\n\n559\n00:27:21.988 --> 00:27:24.807\nWell, I wanna tackle those\nExchange specific ones, but\n\n560\n00:27:24.807 --> 00:27:26.991\nI'm a little short on\ntime on this segment.\n\n561\n00:27:26.991 --> 00:27:28.336\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n562\n00:27:28.336 --> 00:27:31.819\nWe're gonna to go for an unprecedented\npart three for this episode and\n\n563\n00:27:31.819 --> 00:27:34.073\nwe'll jump back into Exchange monitoring.\n\n564\n00:27:34.073 --> 00:27:37.713\nWe'll get a chance to see those\nspecific counters and how they work and\n\n565\n00:27:37.713 --> 00:27:41.600\nget us to that point where we can start\nto take that baseline of our system and\n\n566\n00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.707\nknow that things are running\nthe way they're supposed to.\n\n567\n00:27:44.707 --> 00:27:48.851\nSo stay tuned, we've got part three\ncoming up as for this one though,\n\n568\n00:27:48.851 --> 00:27:50.407\nsigning off for ITProTV.\n\n569\n00:27:50.407 --> 00:27:52.915\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n570\n00:27:52.915 -->

--> 00:00:24.100\nAnd in this episode we're continuing\non with our, well it was a two part\n\n6\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.150\nseries now three part series on monitoring\nand maintaining exchange servers.\n\n7\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.700\nNow if you haven't watched the other\nepisodes I definitely encourage you\n\n8\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.490\nto do that, but in this episode we\nare kind of taking a different angle\n\n9\n00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.570\nin our last episode we saw some of the\nperformance counters we want to monitor.\n\n10\n00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.090\nFor really any Microsoft server.\n\n11\n00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.430\nRight?\nProcessor, memory, disk, and network.\n\n12\n00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.460\nRight?\nThe utilization for each of those and\n\n13\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.250\nwhat we expect them to look like.\n\n14\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.670\nWhat we need to watch out for\non those guys.\n\n15\n00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.670\nBut in this episode, I wanna look\nat the exchange specific counters.\n\n16\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.810\nThings that are really important\nto monitor on an exchange server.\n\n17\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.610\nAnd I call this the client experience.\n\n18\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.130\nSo when an end user\nconnects to your server,\n\n19\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.930\ntheir experiences are controlled by\na number of factors on the back end.\n\n20\n00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.907\nAny one of which can cause their\nexperience to completely fail or\n\n21\n00:01:10.907 --> 00:01:15.707\nbe really slow, so when a user calls in\nand says, hey my email is really slow.\n\n22\n00:01:15.707 --> 00:01:16.730\nWe need to know where to look.\n\n23\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.720\nWe need to know where our\npotential problems could be.\n\n24\n00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.470\nAnd those are the counters\nwe're gonna look at here.\n\n25\n00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.090\nWell, if you didn't\nwatch the last episode,\n\n26\n00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.020\nlet me just kind of get\nyou back up to speed.\n\n27\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.500\nThese are the counters that\nwe were talking about.\n\n28\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.610\nWe talked about some others too.\n\n29\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.860\nBut, you'll see where I've got some\nmemory, network, physical disc and\n\n30\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.400\nCPU counters that are kind of added\nin here in my performance monitor.\n\n31\n00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.520\nAnd those are great just for\nmonitoring, really, any old server.\n\n32\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.770\nBut when it comes to\nthe client experience we have\n\n33\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.880\nsome counters that are appropriate for\na mailbox database, and\n\n34\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.590\nsome counters that are appropriate for\na client access server.\n\n35\n00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.290\nLet's start with the mailbox database.\n\n36\n00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.770\nBecause odds are in your network,\n\n37\n00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.460\nif there's a bottleneck anywhere,\nit's the mailbox database.\n\n38\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.690\nDatabases are big.\n\n39\n00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.940\nThey're complex, and\nthey're stored on disk.\n\n40\n00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.000\nAnd disk is slow and as a result that's\nusually where our bottleneck is.\n\n41\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.110\nBut it would be nice to know that for\n\n42\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.550\na fact before we just go and\nassume and turn out to be wrong.\n\n43\n00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.300\nSo let's start with counters that we\nwant to monitor on a mailbox database.\n\n44\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.590\nI'm gonna go into my performance monitor.\n\n45\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.350\nAnd I'm just gonna hit my little green\nplus here to add some more counters in,\n\n46\n00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.450\nand we're gonna look for\nsome of these special counters.\n\n47\n00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.370\nNow in the last episode, I stayed with\njust standard Microsoft Windows ones.\n\n48\n00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.350\nThis time,\nwe're gonna do Microsoft Exchange ones.\n\n49\n00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.660\nSo, as you scroll around in the counters\nhere in the list you'll notice\n\n50\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.390\na huge section where every\ncounter starts with MSExchange.\n\n51\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.690\nThese are the Exchange specific ones,\nand that's where I wanna go.\n\n52\n00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.000\nOne of the key ones to look for\n\n53\n00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.990\non a database server are the counters\nlocated as part of the information store.\n\n54\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.410\nSo, if you scroll around in here and\nlook for\n\n55\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.930\nthe counter that's called\nMS Exchange IS Store.\n\n56\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.480\nAnd I will find it right there.\n\n57\n00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.480\nThere we go.\n\n58\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.720\nThat's the information store service.\n\n59\n00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.790\nAnd that's what's controlling your\ndatabase, your mailbox databases.\n\n60\n00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.360\nSo, if the performance here is bad,\nperformance on my databases are bad.\n\n61\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.530\nAnd when you look, you can monitor\nall sorts of crazy things, but\n\n62\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.820\nthere's one counter in here that I really\nlike, and it's called RPC Average Latency.\n\n63\n00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.900\nSo if I scroll down, I'll find it\nprobably down in the Rs somewhere.\n\n64\n00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.930\nIt is very near, right there.\n\n65\n00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.930\nRPC average latency, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.920\nWhat is that?\n\n67\n00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.810\nWell RPC is remote procedure call, when\nsomebody connects via Outlook, Outlook is\n\n68\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.420\nconnecting to the server via RPC over\nhttp, it's doing a remote procedure call.\n\n69\n00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.370\nAnd when somebody logs\ninto Outlook web access,\n\n70\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.170\nthey hit the client access server via OWA\nand the client access server proxies that\n\n71\n00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.310\nto the back end as an RPC\ncall to the mailbox server.\n\n72\n00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.690\nSo our clients are typically\nusing RCP when they connect.\n\n73\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.270\nAnd if RPC is experiencing latency that's\ngonna result in a slow experience for\n\n74\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.570\nthe end-user, right.\n\n75\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.820\nThis is a great way to monitor whether\nend-users are having slow connectivity,\n\n76\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.170\nbecause they might not notice themselves,\nright.\n\n77\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.030\nA great example's if\n\n78\n00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.180\nthey're running Outlook they might\nbe running Outlook cache mode.\n\n79\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.400\nIt's the default.\n\n80\n00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.790\nSo they're accessing their mailbox\nright there on their hard drive.\n\n81\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.720\nWhen a new email comes in,\n\n82\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.935\nthey don't notice that\nthe server hasn't told them yet.\n\n83\n00:04:10.935 --> 00:04:12.210\nCuz they don't know the email exists yet.\n\n84\n00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.280\nAnd then, all of a sudden,\nthey see the email come in.\n\n85\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.420\nThey have no idea a delay happened.\n\n86\n00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.560\nSo they might not even realize it.\n\n87\n00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.220\nYour OWA users.\n\n88\n00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.120\nThey're the ones who will\nusually notice first.\n\n89\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.860\nWhen they go to log into OWN, it takes\nforever for their mailbox to load.\n\n90\n00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.960\nOr it fails to load, and\nthey get a server error, right?\n\n91\n00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.330\nLike a 500 error or some other message,\nthey'll know that there's a problem.\n\n92\n00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.990\nBut we can spot it early if we're\nwatching the RPC average latency.\n\n93\n00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.450\nNow, if you go out and about on\nthe internet, Microsoft's tech net site,\n\n94\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.395\nthere's a number of different kind of\nsides of what this value should be.\n\n95\n00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:48.555\nI've seen some people say oh it should\nalways be under 30 milliseconds.\n\n96\n00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:51.495\nSo if I monitor the sales database\nhere I want the sales database\n\n97\n00:04:51.495 --> 00:04:53.665\nto always respond within 30 milliseconds.\n\n98\n00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:56.075\nThere's other people that\nsay 50 milliseconds but\n\n99\n00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:58.605\nthe reality is it could\nbe significantly longer.\n\n100\n00:04:58.605 --> 00:05:01.860\nIt could be five or ten seconds and\nyour engineer probably won't notice.\n\n101\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.560\nBut if it gets really big then you're\ngonna start having time outs on\n\n102\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.480\nthe servers and\nthat's when you get errors.\n\n103\n00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.510\nOr if it's just a little bit big,\nthe end users see a slow session and\n\n104\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.380\nthen they whine.\n\n105\n00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.750\nI'm sorry,\nthey lodge a technical support ticket.\n\n106\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.770\nSo, either way it's something that we\ncould be watching ahead of time and\n\n107\n00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.470\nif you see this number growing and growing\nand growing it means one of two things.\n\n108\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.090\nNumber one there's a problem\nsomewhere on your server.\n\n109\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.530\nMaybe you have a database\nstored on a RAID 5 array and\n\n110\n00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.230\none drive has failed and now it's having\nto recalculate the database from parody\n\n111\n00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.870\nwhich slows down disk IO\nan it slows down your server.\n\n112\n00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.820\nRight?\nMaybe that's it.\n\n113\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.170\nOr maybe the server's running just fine.\n\n114\n00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.800\nBut when you specced out\nthe server you had 1,000 users.\n\n115\n00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.850\nNow, you have 1,700 users.\n\n116\n00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.870\nYou've just grown your employees.\n\n117\n00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.020\nOr grown your database.\n\n118\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.660\nThat happens, right?\n\n119\n00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.400\nDatabases grow.\n\n120\n00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.640\nIt's what works.\n\n121\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.550\nIf your company is successful,\nyour company is growing.\n\n122\n00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.170\nSo, you expect to see\nperformance degrade over time.\n\n123\n00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.990\nAnd you need to expand your capacities for\nthat, right?\n\n124\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.940\nSo, this isn't necessarily\nan indication of an unexpected failure.\n\n125\n00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.290\nIt might be an expected one, right?\n\n126\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.710\nWe just expected that to grow and\nbecome more.\n\n127\n00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.080\nSo we wanna monitor that for two reasons.\n\n128\n00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.650\nOne so we know when there's a problem.\n\n129\n00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.120\nAnd two, so\nwe can create trends over time.\n\n130\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.390\nAnd we can say, each month,\nwe're adding employees.\n\n131\n00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.740\nIt's making this latency go up.\n\n132\n00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.600\nBy five milliseconds a month, and\n\n133\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.010\nso by this time next month it will be 50\nmilliseconds slower than it is today.\n\n134\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.250\nIs that a problem?\n\n135\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.310\nIt probably is and you need to plan for\nyour capacity to account for that.\n\n136\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.470\nSo that's a great one to monitor there's\na few others in here that you can find\n\n137\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.120\nin here, theres a really weird\nsection In the performance counters.\n\n138\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.520\nLet me show you guys this one.\n\n139\n00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.620\nIt's just called MS Exchange database.\n\n140\n00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.310\nNow here it was MS Exchange IS store.\n\n141\n00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.090\nThat was the information store.\n\n142\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.260\nBut the one I'm looking for\nis MS Exchange database.\n\n143\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.500\nSo this one pertains to\na database specifically.\n\n144\n00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.080\nIf I can find it.\n\n145\n00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.820\nSo, let's see, MS Exchange database.\n\n146\n00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.810\nWhich you would think would be right here.\n\n147\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.340\nThere might be a space on this one,\nlet's see.\n\n148\n00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.920\nSometimes there's a space after\nMS Exchange, sometimes there isn't and\n\n149\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.880\nso you have to kind of program,\nthere's a space on this one.\n\n150\n00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.580\nSo, MS exchange database equal equal\ngreater than instances, alright.\n\n151\n00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.070\nThis let's you dial in on particular\ninstances on the database.\n\n152\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.930\nNow why is this important?\n\n153\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.880\nIf you have a database availability group\n\n154\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.260\nthen you might have more than one\ninstance of the same database.\n\n155\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.630\nWhen I monitor that information store\ncounterage looking at one server,\n\n156\n00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.160\nwhich means that one\ncopy of that database.\n\n157\n00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.030\nBut if I want to monitor more than one\ncopy of the same database I need to\n\n158\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.480\ncome here to instances to find it and\nlocate that database,\n\n159\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.680\nand you'll see counters in here\nthat are similar to the other one.\n\n160\n00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.940\nBut the one that I like to watch\nis this log threads waiting.\n\n161\n00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.180\nSo if you look around underneath it\nhere you'll find log threads waiting.\n\n162\n00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.317\nLog threads waiting that's talking\nabout writing to the transactions logs.\n\n163\n00:07:56.317 --> 00:07:58.835\nAll right, when your sending\ndata into the transactions\n\n164\n00:07:58.835 --> 00:08:01.363\nlogs You have to write to them,\nyou have to write to disk.\n\n165\n00:08:01.363 --> 00:08:05.740\nAnd if you have log threads waiting and\nthat number is growing,\n\n166\n00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.483\nideally it should be 0.\n\n167\n00:08:07.483 --> 00:08:10.010\nMaybe a 1 or 2, it shouldn't be many.\n\n168\n00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.890\nBut if this number is growing, that\nmeans your system is trying to write to\n\n169\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.690\nthe transaction logs and\nfor some reason it can't.\n\n170\n00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.440\nIt's having to wait too long.\n\n171\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.740\nSo maybe there's heavy disk I/O,\nmaybe there's disk contention.\n\n172\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.033\nYour transaction logs might be\nstored on the same hard drives as\n\n173\n00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:24.410\nyour Mailbox Database.\n\n174\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.820\nThis is a great warning sign to say,\nmove them off.\n\n175\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.160\nMove your transaction logs\nto dedicated hard drives.\n\n176\n00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.090\nCuz you need rights to occur as fast\nas possible for those transaction logs.\n\n177\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.370\nSo this log threads waiting,\nreally a great one to monitor.\n\n178\n00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.450\nAnd then down here you'll see\nwhere I can pick the individual\n\n179\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.750\ninstances of the databases, so\nI see SalesDB and Mailbox Database.\n\n180\n00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.680\nEach of those guys listed down here,\nand you can pick the one that you want.\n\n181\n00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.657\nAnd notice how I've got Information\nStore SalesDB, and right down here,\n\n182\n00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:57.087\nI've got MS Exchange Replication SalesDB\npassive in block mode.\n\n183\n00:08:57.087 --> 00:09:00.880\nSo it's showing each of\nthese different instances.\n\n184\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.629\nBut you might even just wanna\ngo all instances if you just\n\n185\n00:09:03.629 --> 00:09:05.744\nhave like one big database, or whatever.\n\n186\n00:09:05.744 --> 00:09:09.660\nBut we're trying to keep an eye on whether\nour transaction logs are backing up.\n\n187\n00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.930\nThis is a great counter to monitor for\nthat.\n\n188\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.115\nI'll just monitor my SalesDB and\nthrow that one in there.\n\n189\n00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:20.440\nAll right, while I'm in here, that's\nusually the one I keep an eye out for, but\n\n190\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.829\nthere's another one, which is the, or\nanother two I guess, the I/O database,\n\n191\n00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:27.329\nwhich is the input and\noutput on our database.\n\n192\n00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:29.400\nWe want to see how busy the databases are.\n\n193\n00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.230\nAnd so you can find it in here where\nyou've got I/O Database Reads Average\n\n194\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:39.070\nLatency and\nI/O Database Writes Average Latency.\n\n195\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:44.350\nAnd so you can keep track of how\nlong it's taking to read and write.\n\n196\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.190\nWhen you buy a hard drive, it might say,\noh, this is a 15,000 RPM drive with\n\n197\n00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.207\none millisecond seek time on it or\nsomething ridiculous like that.\n\n198\n00:09:53.207 --> 00:09:54.329\nWell, that sounds great.\n\n199\n00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:57.358\nIt's got a one millisecond seek time,\nso can I send data to it or\n\n200\n00:09:57.358 --> 00:09:59.200\nget data out of it in one millisecond?\n\n201\n00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.380\nWell, no.\n\n202\n00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.230\nThe seek time is how long it takes\nthe hard drive head to get into position.\n\n203\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.500\nYou still have to send data\nacross your controller.\n\n204\n00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.408\nDoes it work on the hard drive?\n\n205\n00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:11.110\nYou get data back on the controller and\nthen send it to the operating system.\n\n206\n00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.350\nThere's many components\nthat are in the mix.\n\n207\n00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.230\nThis measures the whole path.\n\n208\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.336\nHow long does it take me?\n\n209\n00:10:16.336 --> 00:10:20.019\nIf I wanna read something from the disk,\nhow long does it take me to go through\n\n210\n00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:24.223\nthe controller, get to the drive, retrieve\nthe data, put it back to the controller,\n\n211\n00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:26.090\nsend it into RAM, and then access it.\n\n212\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:31.170\nAnd the longer that takes, the slower\nthe user experience is gonna be.\n\n213\n00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.550\nAnd so this might mean I need to upgrade\nmy controllers, move to different storage,\n\n214\n00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.234\nadd, well, more drives aren't normally the\nsolution on this one, more controllers is.\n\n215\n00:10:38.234 --> 00:10:40.510\nSo a couple of different solutions there.\n\n216\n00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.352\nBut this is a good set\nof counters to watch.\n\n217\n00:10:42.352 --> 00:10:46.887\nThe Log Threads Waiting is a great one\nto watch, but I/O on the database,\n\n218\n00:10:46.887 --> 00:10:48.650\nthat's another one.\n\n219\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.650\nLog threads is the transaction logs,\nI/O on the database,\n\n220\n00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.915\nthat's the database itself, right, and\nwhere the email's actually being stored.\n\n221\n00:10:55.915 --> 00:10:56.565\nOkay?\n\n222\n00:10:56.565 --> 00:10:59.485\nSo those are a couple of ones that we\ndefinitely want to monitor there, and\n\n223\n00:10:59.485 --> 00:11:03.745\non a mailbox server, those will give\nyou a pretty good indication, right?\n\n224\n00:11:03.745 --> 00:11:08.430\nThose in combination with the counters we\ntalked about in part two of this episode,\n\n225\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.940\nthose will really give you a great\nview of a mailbox server and\n\n226\n00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.480\nwhat your end user's experience is like.\n\n227\n00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.110\nA client access server is\na little bit different.\n\n228\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.035\nA client access server, if you remember,\n\n229\n00:11:19.035 --> 00:11:22.570\nit's really a web server that's running\nlike a POP3 proxy and an IMAP proxy.\n\n230\n00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.461\nAnd it just pushes people through\nto the mailbox server and\n\n231\n00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:27.150\nit renders some webpages.\n\n232\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.392\nSo not a lot of disk I/O\non a client access server.\n\n233\n00:11:30.392 --> 00:11:34.240\nAnd it's really just kinda CPU and\npushing people through.\n\n234\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.260\nSo on a client access server,\nwe wanna monitor CPU, memory,\n\n235\n00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.310\ndisk, network, just like normal.\n\n236\n00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:44.450\nBut there's a few other kind of experience\ncounters that we wanna watch out for.\n\n237\n00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.605\nLet me show you those.\n\n238\n00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:49.060\nSo the key things we wanna look for,\nI know I've said multiple\n\n239\n00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.786\ntimes throughout the show that a client\naccess server doesn't really have queues.\n\n240\n00:11:53.786 --> 00:11:56.660\nIt's not really storing\nanything on the hard drive.\n\n241\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.860\nWell, it's not that it\ndoesn't have queues.\n\n242\n00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.160\nIt has queues, they're just in RAM.\n\n243\n00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.600\nSo data moves through them very,\nvery quickly and it doesn't stay.\n\n244\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.380\nThey're transient queues.\n\n245\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.450\nIt doesn't have queues on the hard drive\nwhere data gets written and saved,\n\n246\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.201\nlike the transport role on\na mailbox server would.\n\n247\n00:12:12.201 --> 00:12:16.121\nSo, with a client access server,\ndisk I/O is not in the picture, so\n\n248\n00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:19.840\nI don't necessarily need to monitor that,\nbut the queue in RAM,\n\n249\n00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.230\nI might want to monitor that.\n\n250\n00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.330\nIf the queue in RAM starts to back up,\n\n251\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.800\nit usually means your\nmailbox servers are offline.\n\n252\n00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.390\nIt could mean a network issue, but it\ntypically means that the mailbox servers\n\n253\n00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.870\nare offline, or\nthe mailbox databases are offline.\n\n254\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.460\nBut usually if it's mailbox\ndatabase that's offline\n\n255\n00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.799\nthe queues on the mailbox\nserver are still up, so\n\n256\n00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:40.650\nthe email moves right through the client\naccess server over the mailbox server and\n\n257\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.280\nit's gone as far as the client\naccess server is concerned.\n\n258\n00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.290\nBut it doesn't hurt to monitor\nthose queues if you want to.\n\n259\n00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:53.800\nSo on a client access server you can go\nin here to MSExchangeTransport Queues.\n\n260\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.170\nAnd so if we find that in our list,\nMSExchangeTransport Queues, right there.\n\n261\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.780\nYou'll see a number of different queues\nthat you can monitor different aspects\n\n262\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.890\nabout the queues.\n\n263\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.510\nAnd the one that I like to look for\nis Messages Queued For Delivery.\n\n264\n00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.620\nAnd so if we hunt down and find that one,\nMessages Queued For Delivery.\n\n265\n00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.900\nRight there, okay.\n\n266\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.750\nAnd you can monitor the messages, you\ncan monitor total across all the queues.\n\n267\n00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.770\nSee how if I pick for\ndelivery you can pick based on priority.\n\n268\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:25.160\nBut if you go down here to delivery\ntotal it's the same thing,\n\n269\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.890\nwell what's the difference there?\n\n270\n00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.490\nWell you have two different types\nof queues that are in here.\n\n271\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.780\nThere's queues for email that's coming\nin or going to the outside world.\n\n272\n00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.690\nAnd then you have cues\nthat are emails going\n\n273\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.400\nto a particular mailbox in your\norganization, internal delivery type.\n\n274\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.360\nAnd so, there's queues tied to a domain,\nversus queues tied to a mailbox database,\n\n275\n00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.430\nand so\nthat's why they kind of divide these up.\n\n276\n00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.927\nBut you can come through and\npick what it is that you monitor here.\n\n277\n00:13:51.927 --> 00:13:54.950\nI usually just do Messages Queued For\nDelivery, and that's the one I wanna see.\n\n278\n00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.537\nAnd I grab it in total.\n\n279\n00:13:56.537 --> 00:13:58.100\nYou watch this.\n\n280\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.970\nAnd you might have a big number all\nthe time, if you got a busy server,\n\n281\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.480\nthis number's gonna be big.\n\n282\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.320\nBut if you see it consistently growing,\nthat means your queue is stuck.\n\n283\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.290\nThat means email is piling up in\nthe queue, and you've got a problem.\n\n284\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.060\nCould be a network issue,\ncould be your mailbox database is offline,\n\n285\n00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.140\ncould be no domain controllers available,\nso\n\n286\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.710\nthe client access server can't figure\nout where the mailbox server is.\n\n287\n00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:24.120\nIt's usually connectivity related, so we\ncan look for that and start to isolate it.\n\n288\n00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.898\nThat message queue.\n\n289\n00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.770\nAll right, other things.\n\n290\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:33.040\nIf we wanna see how busy our server is,\nhow much email is coming in and\n\n291\n00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.810\nout of my system, well that's part\nof the FrontEnd Transport roll.\n\n292\n00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.000\nThe FrontEnd Transport queue,\nit's what's in RAM, and\n\n293\n00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.200\nyou can monitor the amount\nof email flowing through it.\n\n294\n00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.370\nIt's not right here,\ncuz that would make too much sense.\n\n295\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.320\nIt's actually in a different place,\ninside of our counters.\n\n296\n00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.633\nI need to look for\nMS Exchange FrontEnd Transport.\n\n297\n00:14:49.633 --> 00:14:53.397\nSo I'm gonna kind of scroll and\ntry and find that.\n\n298\n00:14:53.397 --> 00:14:58.771\nAnd you'll see there's a lot that you\ncan monitor on the FrontEnd Transport,\n\n299\n00:14:58.771 --> 00:15:04.030\nand the one I'm looking for is Smtp,\nhere we go, SmtpReceive and Send.\n\n300\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.180\nThese two guys.\n\n301\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.220\nFor email coming in and out of my\norganization it's going to be Smtp, right.\n\n302\n00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.200\nSimple message transport protocol, and\n\n303\n00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.810\nwhen you look in here you'll see\naverage bytes per connection and so on.\n\n304\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.780\nYou can monitor all sorts of aspects.\n\n305\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:20.250\nThe two that I like, Inbound Messages.\n\n306\n00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.560\nYou've got Inbound Message Bytes or you've\nactually got Inbound Messages themselves\n\n307\n00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:30.490\nand so you can spot that in here right\nhere, Inbound Messages Received/sec.\n\n308\n00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.190\nSo, how many emails are coming\ninto my organization per second?\n\n309\n00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.870\nThat's a great one to monitor or\nyou can limit it based on\n\n310\n00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.110\na particular client access server,\nright here, if you just wanna watch.\n\n311\n00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.980\nI'm gonna say, in total.\n\n312\n00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.220\nI wanted them for my whole organization.\n\n313\n00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:43.940\nAnd we can add that in.\n\n314\n00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.410\nAnd then you can do the same thing for\noutbound.\n\n315\n00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.730\nSo if I go to, whoops.\n\n316\n00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.700\nI get a little crazy here and\nscroll too far.\n\n317\n00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:57.107\nIf I go to my FrontEndTransport SmtpSend,\nI can look for the total going out, right?\n\n318\n00:15:57.107 --> 00:16:01.860\nSo I gotta find my Messages\nsent per second right here, and\n\n319\n00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.610\nI can add that one in.\n\n320\n00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.930\nAnd I can do this one based on which\noutbound connector it's using, or\n\n321\n00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.350\nI can just go total.\n\n322\n00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.320\nAnd so now I have an idea of how much\nemail is flowing through my organization.\n\n323\n00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.555\nNow, this is SMTP.\n\n324\n00:16:14.555 --> 00:16:18.780\nSMTP does include internal email too,\nwhen it moves between servers, so\n\n325\n00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.500\nwe can capture that and\nget that same information alongside it.\n\n326\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:23.640\nAll right.\n\n327\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.110\nWhat else do we wanna watch for?\n\n328\n00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:29.630\nWell, as far as SMTP is concerned,\nas far as the mail queues go,\n\n329\n00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.160\nthose are some good counters.\n\n330\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.250\nWhat about Outlook web access?\n\n331\n00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.550\nIn the past, Outlook web access has\nbeen notoriously difficult to monitor.\n\n332\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.930\nFortunately, we get some new counterS,\nso it'd really help with that.\n\n333\n00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.405\nThere's a great counter buried away\nin here, and this one is buried away.\n\n334\n00:16:43.405 --> 00:16:45.410\n[LAUGH] We've gotta dig for it.\n\n335\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:50.290\nIt's under MS Exchange OWA, so\nlet me just find that in my list here.\n\n336\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.320\nMS Exchange.\n\n337\n00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.740\nIt is, But\nthe hardest part is finding these things.\n\n338\n00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.290\nYou actually have a little search\nfield you can use down here.\n\n339\n00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.730\nBut normally we can scroll and\nfind it pretty quick.\n\n340\n00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.660\nMS Exchange OWA.\n\n341\n00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.580\nI should be close.\n\n342\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.410\nThere it went.\n\n343\n00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.040\nPerfect.\n\n344\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.520\nMS Exchange OWA.\n\n345\n00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.050\nInside of MS Exchange OWA,\n\n346\n00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.620\nthe counter that I'm looking for\nis called Average Response Time.\n\n347\n00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.130\nWith a web server, the main component,\n\n348\n00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.270\nthe main thing I need to watch\nis average response time.\n\n349\n00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.740\nHow long does it take OWA\nto respond to a request?\n\n350\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.770\nOkay.\nIf I send a search to OWA,\n\n351\n00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:31.410\nhow long does it take it to reach out\nto a mailbox server, get the data,\n\n352\n00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.280\nbring it back,\nprovide it to the end user, right.\n\n353\n00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.090\nThat's the end user experience.\n\n354\n00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.120\nSo I'm looking for\nthat average response time.\n\n355\n00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.610\nAnd it's buried down in here, right here.\n\n356\n00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.600\nAnd you actually have average\nsearch times separately.\n\n357\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.340\nI know I mentioned search a second ago,\nbut average response time for\n\n358\n00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.590\nrendering anything else\nproviding that data.\n\n359\n00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.990\nAnd now we can get an idea of\nwhat our end users are seeing.\n\n360\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.300\nThis is really the face\nthat your end users see.\n\n361\n00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.210\nThey don't know about disk IO,\nthey don't know about network,\n\n362\n00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.310\nthey don't care about it.\n\n363\n00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.120\nThey just wanna know when they fire up\nthat web browser, why is it taking so\n\n364\n00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.920\nlong to open this email, right?\n\n365\n00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.560\nAnd this is a great way for\nus to monitor that ahead of time.\n\n366\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.090\nOr, to say if somebody calls complaining\nhey, it's taking forever for\n\n367\n00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.340\nOWA to load,\nwe can look at this counter and say,\n\n368\n00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.850\nwell no it's actually taking just\nas long as it ever has, right.\n\n369\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.740\nIt's just you're in a hurry, or\n\n370\n00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.170\nyou're experiencing this more differently\nthis time for whatever reason.\n\n371\n00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:21.495\nPsychological disorder, who knows.\n\n372\n00:18:21.495 --> 00:18:25.150\n[LAUGH] So these are the kind of things\nthat we need to be able to monitor so\n\n373\n00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.360\nthat we have tangible numbers\nthat we can provide to people.\n\n374\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.460\nOne last one I wanna throw in here,\nif you're doing OWA.\n\n375\n00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:39.160\nThere's a special type of interface\nwith OWA for the free busy data, for\n\n376\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.280\nthe calendar data.\n\n377\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:40.900\nAll right?\n\n378\n00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.760\nWhen you go an run like the meeting\nminder, it's gotta reach out\n\n379\n00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.130\nto Exchange and query other people's\nfree busy data and present that.\n\n380\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.750\nThat's actually not tracked\nin the average response time.\n\n381\n00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:54.610\nSo if you want that one, that's actually,\nyou got another completely separate area.\n\n382\n00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.950\nIt's the MS exchange\navailability services.\n\n383\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.260\nAnd I know when I see availability\nservices I always think of redundancy.\n\n384\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.030\nBut it's availability as in\npeople's scheduled availability.\n\n385\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.280\nAnd so if we find that in here,\nI just passed it.\n\n386\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.660\nThere it is.\n\n387\n00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.310\nUnder availability service, you'll\nactually see the same kind of thing.\n\n388\n00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.340\nThere's the average time to process.\n\n389\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.260\nHere we go.\n\n390\n00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.080\nAnd the one we really care\nabout is this guy right here.\n\n391\n00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.190\nAverage Time to Process\na Free Busy Request.\n\n392\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.770\nSo when somebody hits that OWA\nserver with a Free Busy Request or\n\n393\n00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.520\njust a client accessor in general.\n\n394\n00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.520\nHow long does it take us to query that\ndata and provide it back to the user?\n\n395\n00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.840\nThis is another area where it'll\nbe the end-user experience,\n\n396\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.840\nkinda what they feel\nwhen they use the server.\n\n397\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.570\nRight?\n\n398\n00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.530\nIf we monitor those,\nwe're in pretty good shape.\n\n399\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:44.620\nNow we've got a handle on our servers, and\nwe take these, we take all of these and\n\n400\n00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.700\nbuild them into a data collector set, and\nwe can collect that data whenever we want.\n\n401\n00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:53.750\nSo we collect it for an hour, a day, or\na week when our servers are running fine.\n\n402\n00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.160\nAnd then when somebody complains,\nwe run these again and\n\n403\n00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.240\nwe collect it during the complaint time.\n\n404\n00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.660\nAnd compare the numbers, right.\n\n405\n00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.890\nComparing the numbers is pretty easy.\n\n406\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.680\nWhen you look at these charts,\nyou can choose any of 'em, and\n\n407\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.710\nyou get the average, the minimum,\nthe maximum, they're laid out right there.\n\n408\n00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.440\nAnd I'm looking at this as a histogram,\nbut\n\n409\n00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.950\nwe can actually change that to a report.\n\n410\n00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.250\nThere, and\nit just lays it out as flat numbers.\n\n411\n00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.870\nAnd we can see it right here,\nwhat are the average numbers?\n\n412\n00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.780\nAnd now I can compare that to\nwhat we took in the past and\n\n413\n00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.220\njust see where we are comparatively.\n\n414\n00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.070\nIf they're the same, then there actually\nisn't a problem, it's a perceived problem.\n\n415\n00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.840\nBut if they're different, I've got\nan issue, and it might be a growth issue,\n\n416\n00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.560\na good issue.\n\n417\n00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.940\nWe just need to expand our capacity, or\nit might be indicative of a real problem.\n\n418\n00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.320\nAll right.\n\n419\n00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.890\nI do want to mention one\nother set of counters.\n\n420\n00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.550\nActive directory counters.\n\n421\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.480\nRemember that Microsoft Exchange\nstores its entire configuration in\n\n422\n00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.790\nthe Active Directory.\n\n423\n00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.270\nSo your exchange servers\nare constantly querying the AD.\n\n424\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.970\nIf the AD is slow,\n\n425\n00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.860\nthen your exchange servers are gonna\nbe slow because they rely on it.\n\n426\n00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.400\nSo it's not a bad idea\nto add a few counters to\n\n427\n00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.330\nkeep track of how your Active Directory\ndomain controls are performing.\n\n428\n00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:08.600\nThere's two counters in particular\nthat I like to watch, which, really,\n\n429\n00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.180\none is just my own information, which is\nthe average time that an LDAP query takes.\n\n430\n00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.650\nLet me show you that one.\n\n431\n00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.280\nSo if I go back here, and\nlet me switch back to a histogram.\n\n432\n00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.990\nNope, not that one,\nyeah line, there we go.\n\n433\n00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.460\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nadd in another counter.\n\n434\n00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:28.720\nAnd the one I'm looking for\nis MS Exchange AD access.\n\n435\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.990\nMS Exchange AD access,\nway up here at the beginning, here we go.\n\n436\n00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.440\nMS Exchange AD access domain controllers.\n\n437\n00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.120\nAnd this is going to help us\nmeasure the response time\n\n438\n00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.940\nexchange servers are getting when they\nreach out to domain controllers, and\n\n439\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.070\nthe counter that I like to look for\nis the LDAP Search time.\n\n440\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.530\nThat's going to let you monitor\nhow much time it takes for\n\n441\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.310\nyour system to run an LDAP query.\n\n442\n00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.210\nSo if you've got a dynamic\ndistribution group and\n\n443\n00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.030\nit includes everybody in a certain OU.\n\n444\n00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.800\nWhenever an email comes in for that\ndistribution group, we've got do a query.\n\n445\n00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.150\nWho's in that OU?\n\n446\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.220\nHow long does it take\nthe AD server to tell us?\n\n447\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.590\nThis counter will let us know.\n\n448\n00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.430\nAnd you can monitor one domain\ncontroller in particular, or\n\n449\n00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.590\nyou can monitor all of them.\n\n450\n00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.960\nI've only got one here.\n\n451\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.820\nSo I'll put that one in and\nI can monitor it.\n\n452\n00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.730\nAnd now it's gonna let me know the type\nof response time I'm getting off that DC,\n\n453\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:17.910\nall right?\n\n454\n00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.750\nThis is one that we watch and\nwe have our own acceptable time.\n\n455\n00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.080\nNow there is a timeout that\noccurs if a query takes too long,\n\n456\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.700\neventually is a problem.\n\n457\n00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.440\nMicrosoft really considers anything\nover 30 seconds to be a problem, but\n\n458\n00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.470\n30 seconds is a really long time.\n\n459\n00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.220\nSo, what we think is a problem\nmight be much shorter.\n\n460\n00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.410\nSo, we need to come up with\nwhat's our acceptable time and\n\n461\n00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.120\nmonitor this to make sure we don't see it.\n\n462\n00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.090\nBut if we hit Microsoft's threshold,\na failure will be generated.\n\n463\n00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.850\nAnd that's another counter we can monitor.\n\n464\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:51.150\nYou'll see LDAP searches\ntime out per minute.\n\n465\n00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.160\nOr time limit exceeded per minute.\n\n466\n00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.850\nHow many took too long?\n\n467\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.590\nHow many exceeded the time limit, or\n\n468\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.820\nhow many actually exceeded\nthe time limit and failed?\n\n469\n00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.770\nThat's even more.\n\n470\n00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.030\nIf this counter is one or\nhigher, any number,\n\n471\n00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.610\nit's a problem,\nsomething we need to address.\n\n472\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.700\nYou either need more domain controllers,\nor maybe your exchange server is in\n\n473\n00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.710\none site, and\nyour domain controller is in another site.\n\n474\n00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.130\nSo we need a DC that is local\nto the exchange server.\n\n475\n00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.980\nWe need to do something to alleviate\nthe pressure on the domain controllers.\n\n476\n00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.120\nAll right, now, that's a lot to take in.\n\n477\n00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.810\nThat's a lot of counters\nthat we can monitor,\n\n478\n00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.290\na lot of information that we can gather.\n\n479\n00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.470\nIf you have systems center operations\nmanagement handle those for\n\n480\n00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.010\nyou, problem solved, right?\n\n481\n00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.390\nBut, let's say we're\ndoing all this by hand,\n\n482\n00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.210\nwe get everything configured and\nthings are running great.\n\n483\n00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.900\nNow, we just monitor it and\nwe're done, right?\n\n484\n00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.150\nWell, there's one more\nthing we want to remember.\n\n485\n00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.950\nIn addition to these performance counters,\nMicrosoft has what they call,\n\n486\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.970\ntheir best practices.\n\n487\n00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.010\nThe best practices for\nhow you should configure Exchange.\n\n488\n00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:53.847\nAnd oftentimes performance issues\nin Exchange are caused because we\n\n489\n00:23:53.847 --> 00:23:55.443\nmisconfigured something.\n\n490\n00:23:55.443 --> 00:23:59.403\nWe configured something different than\nthe way that Microsoft wanted us to.\n\n491\n00:23:59.403 --> 00:24:01.940\nSo Microsoft has a really cool utility,\n\n492\n00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.680\ncalled the Exchange Best\nPractices Analyzer, the BPA.\n\n493\n00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.220\nThat can scan our exchange environment and\n\n494\n00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.750\nlet us know whether we're configured\nto Microsoft standards or not.\n\n495\n00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.410\nAll right.\n\n496\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.150\nNow there was a period of time when\nExchange 2013 first came out when the tool\n\n497\n00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.180\nwasn't available.\n\n498\n00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.800\nBut the tool is available now.\n\n499\n00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.310\nIf you search on the Internet, you'll find\na lot of people saying it's not available.\n\n500\n00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.360\nBut it is.\nLet me show you how you get at it.\n\n501\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.696\nSo if you're in your Exchange environment\nall you have to do is jump into your\n\n502\n00:24:27.696 --> 00:24:29.749\nExchange administration center.\n\n503\n00:24:29.749 --> 00:24:34.779\nAnd if you go all the way down here to\nTools if your running Exchange Server\n\n504\n00:24:34.779 --> 00:24:40.130\n2013 Service pack 1 or higher,\nyou'll see this guy right here.\n\n505\n00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:45.760\nCheck your on premise Exchange server with\nthe Office 365 best practices analyzer.\n\n506\n00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.340\nNow that Office 365 part, that's the\nreason why it wasn't available originally.\n\n507\n00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:55.347\nMicrosoft said our new best practice\nis for you to use Office 365.\n\n508\n00:24:55.347 --> 00:24:58.710\nAnd so in the beginning the BPA was\nonly available for Office 365 and\n\n509\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:01.310\na lot of people weren't\ntoo happy about that.\n\n510\n00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.540\nAnd so Microsoft said after fact,\nokay, okay,\n\n511\n00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.820\nit's okay if you just have all\nyour mail servers on premises.\n\n512\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.900\nAnd so\nnow they made the tool available here, and\n\n513\n00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.580\nyou can run it on your on-premises server.\n\n514\n00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.240\nNow when you click on that link,\nit just goes to Microsoft's web page,\n\n515\n00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.850\nwhere you can download the tool.\n\n516\n00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.620\nSo you actually don't have to go to\nyour administration center to do it.\n\n517\n00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.090\nYou can go to their website, and\n\n518\n00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:22.260\nyou can download it, and it's gonna\npull it down so you can install it.\n\n519\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.000\nAll right?\nYou\n\n520\n00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.970\ncan also just do a Google search,\nit'll turn up.\n\n521\n00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.480\nJust make sure you get the one for\nExchange 2013, cuz there's a different one\n\n522\n00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.330\nfor exchange 2010 and a different one for\n2007 they released multiple versions.\n\n523\n00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.010\nNow I've already got in\ninstalled on this server here.\n\n524\n00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:40.100\nLet me get out of my performance\nmonitor and I will fire it up.\n\n525\n00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.480\nAnd when your running it looks like this,\nit's a simple wizard that we pass through\n\n526\n00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.970\nand as we complete the wizard\nit'll scan our environment and\n\n527\n00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:47.960\nlet us know how things look.\n\n528\n00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.070\nNow it does still expect\nyou to have Office 365 but\n\n529\n00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.440\nit doesn't require you to have it.\n\n530\n00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.790\nSo, as I move forward,\nI'm going to ignore some of that stuff.\n\n531\n00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.260\nI'm going to choose to start my scan, and\n\n532\n00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.770\nas it starts to scan, it's prompting\nme for Office 365 credentials.\n\n533\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.780\nIf you've got them, put them in there,\n\n534\n00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.280\nand then it will be able to scan your\nAzure systems and your systems right here.\n\n535\n00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.530\nIt will scan them both and\nlet you know what's what.\n\n536\n00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.350\nBut if you don't, just hit Cancel.\n\n537\n00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.460\nIf you just cancel that, it'll go\nthrough and run the rest of your scans.\n\n538\n00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.060\nAll right.\n\n539\n00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.760\nAnd at the end, when we get on our report,\nwell, actually,\n\n540\n00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.220\nI have a little warning that'll say,\nOffice 365 wasn't tested.\n\n541\n00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.690\nYou just ignore that warning.\n\n542\n00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:29.690\nAll the other stuff is still very accurate\nand a great view of your system and\n\n543\n00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:31.490\nwhether or\nnot you're conforming to standards.\n\n544\n00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.440\nNow, in my lab environment\nI broke many rules.\n\n545\n00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.150\nSo, you'll see that I've got a bunch.\n\n546\n00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:37.980\nI've got 19 failed checks.\n\n547\n00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.090\nThat's pretty bad, all right?\n\n548\n00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:44.400\nI've got 22 warning checks,\na bunch of informational and 136 passed.\n\n549\n00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.190\nWell, it's telling me\nit found some problems.\n\n550\n00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.370\nThose 19 failed checks,\nI need to deal with those.\n\n551\n00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:53.810\nThose are 19 things I need to get squared\naway if I'm gonna put this in production.\n\n552\n00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.680\nThe 22 warnings,\nthose are ones I need to be aware of.\n\n553\n00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.990\nI might need to correct them, or I might\nhave a reason why I didn't follow them.\n\n554\n00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:05.120\nAnd if I have a reason,\nit's okay to ignore the warning.\n\n555\n00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.780\nBut if I don't have a reason,\nthen I need to correct them.\n\n556\n00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.670\nSo, those are a little more subjective.\n\n557\n00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.520\nInformational and passed,\nI can ignore those.\n\n558\n00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.290\nThose are good.\n\n559\n00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:13.870\nI'm in good shape on those.\n\n560\n00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.070\nIf I take a look at failed checks,\n\n561\n00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.260\nit's going to start telling me\nsome prompts, like this one.\n\n562\n00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.310\nActive directory.\n\n563\n00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.480\nCheck if more than one global\ncatalog servers are configured.\n\n564\n00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.360\nWell, I only have one domain controller,\nso I've only got one global\n\n565\n00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.890\ncatalog server, so it's complaining\nthat I don't have a second one.\n\n566\n00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:29.680\nValid point.\n\n567\n00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.890\nI need a second domain controller.\n\n568\n00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:31.750\nSo I need to correct that.\n\n569\n00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.610\nCheck whether your mailbox\ndatabases are being backed up.\n\n570\n00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:39.200\nWell, I kind of haven't run a backup on\nthese servers because it's just a lab.\n\n571\n00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.900\nThat's a problem.\n\n572\n00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.280\nI need to start taking backups.\n\n573\n00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.560\nSo these are the things that it tells us.\n\n574\n00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.410\nSome of them are really obvious.\n\n575\n00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.580\nSome of them are a little more vague.\n\n576\n00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:53.130\nSome of them, if you look in here,\nhow about this guy, the OWACTP monitor.\n\n577\n00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.350\nAll right, what is that?\n\n578\n00:27:56.885 --> 00:27:58.785\nWell, it doesn't say.\n\n579\n00:27:58.785 --> 00:28:01.515\nAnd if I double-click on it,\nI don't get any information there.\n\n580\n00:28:01.515 --> 00:28:04.385\nYou can save the results and\nit gives you a little bit more.\n\n581\n00:28:04.385 --> 00:28:06.945\nIf I view the details on this,\nand I look for\n\n582\n00:28:06.945 --> 00:28:11.475\nthat CTP monitor in the results come out,\nwe can find it in here.\n\n583\n00:28:11.475 --> 00:28:15.020\nAnd you get just a hair\nmore information on it.\n\n584\n00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.960\nSo here it's telling me that the OWACTP\nmonitor on Exchange Server lab\n\n585\n00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.820\ncastle one is unhealthy.\n\n586\n00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.740\nThat may cause a special unhealthy state,\n\n587\n00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.630\nand then it's telling me how to check\nit to use the get-serverhealth.\n\n588\n00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:30.320\nSo I get more information there and\nI can start to look and try and\n\n589\n00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.040\nfind that problem.\n\n590\n00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.510\nAnd if I know what to look for,\nthat helps.\n\n591\n00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:41.810\nSo I go fire up my PowerShell and\nI can run Get-ServerHealth and\n\n592\n00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.370\npull that information up and\nsee what's up.\n\n593\n00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.470\nOh, I forgot to provide a server name,\nit kinda needs that one, so\n\n594\n00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.980\nmaybe I'll check this guy.\n\n595\n00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.790\nAnd it's gonna return all this\ninformation back on the system,\n\n596\n00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.640\nletting me know what's healthy and\nwhat's not.\n\n597\n00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.500\nSo we can start to try and find that\nproblem and isolate where the issue is.\n\n598\n00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.930\nThis is a great way to\nkinda find the information.\n\n599\n00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.330\nThe best practice is analyzer.\n\n600\n00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.420\nIt's not forced.\n\n601\n00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.910\nYou can have 19 failed checks on there and\n\n602\n00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:11.410\nbe okay; but, it means you've gone\nagainst Microsoft's best practices.\n\n603\n00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.160\nSo you better have a reason for it,\nand you better know what you're doing,\n\n604\n00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.510\nbecause the guys at Microsoft, they wrote\nthis stuff, they kind of know what they're\n\n605\n00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.990\ndoing, so they have a very specific\nreason for wanting it a certain way.\n\n606\n00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:24.620\nYou've gotta have a very specific\nreason for not wanting it that way.\n\n607\n00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.030\nAnd if you deviate too far, you can make\nit where Microsoft won't support you.\n\n608\n00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.590\nWhere you call them on the phone,\nand they're like look,\n\n609\n00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.160\nwe can't help you because you've done xyz,\nand that's just not right.\n\n610\n00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.970\nThat's not the way this is intended to\nbe used, and you end up with no support.\n\n611\n00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.560\nSo we need to keep an eye on that.\n\n612\n00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.900\nBut using the best practices analyzer\nis not something we just do once.\n\n613\n00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.380\nYou want to do it routinely, because you\nmight have set up the server perfect,\n\n614\n00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.990\njust the right way or\nyour whole server farm.\n\n615\n00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:52.240\nBut over time, more servers get added,\nother people work on it, and\n\n616\n00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.730\nmaybe you start to deviate\naway from the best practices.\n\n617\n00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.580\nAnd so we need to tweak that,\nwe need to change it and adjust it and\n\n618\n00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.800\nget it to where things are squared away.\n\n619\n00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.530\nSo definitely make use of that utility.\n\n620\n00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.450\nIt's a great one.\n\n621\n00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:05.910\nIt's baked right in to the exchange,\n\n622\n00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.650\nwell the link is at least,\nthen we download it and install it.\n\n623\n00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.630\nThen we can run that scan and\nit checks our systems.\n\n624\n00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.890\nIt gives you a great bit of information\nand it doesn't cost you a dime, right?\n\n625\n00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.210\nThat's analyzer it's available for free.\n\n626\n00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.930\nAll right, well what was supposed to be\na two part series ended up being a three\n\n627\n00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.770\npart, but I can say, as of right now, you\nguys have seen the typical monitoring and\n\n628\n00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:27.060\nmaintenance techniques we've got for\nexchange.\n\n629\n00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.550\nObviously, the big takeaway here,\nwatch your servers, watch it.\n\n630\n00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.180\nWatch them when they're good,\nrecord those values.\n\n631\n00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.670\nWatch them when they're bad and\ncompare the values, and\n\n632\n00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.860\nnow you'll know a better idea of\nwhere that problem is coming from,\n\n633\n00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.200\nwhere it originates, and\nwhere to start your troubleshooting.\n\n634\n00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.870\nThere's a lot of stuff out there so it is\ndifficult sometimes to keep that straight\n\n635\n00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.520\nand make sure that we\nare working in the environment.\n\n636\n00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.110\nThat we are working where\nthe actual problem is and\n\n637\n00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.500\nnot just where some kind of symptom is.\n\n638\n00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.200\nAll right.\n\n639\n00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.480\nBut otherwise I think that is about it\nfrom me for monitoring and maintenance.\n\n640\n00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.960\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n641\n00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.233\nStay tuned we got more exchange\ncontent coming down the road but for\n\n642\n00:31:02.233 --> 00:31:04.869\nright now, signing off for\nITProTV, I am Don Pezet.\n\n643\n00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:06.129\nAnd I'll see you next time.\n\n644\n00:31:06.129 -->

00:00:16.297\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:17.940\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.296\nBack again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:24.520\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at a pretty neat topic.\n\n7\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.910\nWe're gonna look at database\navailability groups.\n\n8\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.070\nNow, inside of Exchange we have a role,\nthe mailbox server role, and\n\n9\n00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.960\nthat's where all of our email gets stored,\nand it's all stored in a big fat database.\n\n10\n00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.020\nWell, what happens if that\ndatabase goes offline?\n\n11\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.680\nOur users can't get to their email, right?\n\n12\n00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.890\nThat's pretty bad.\n\n13\n00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.610\nIn the past,\n\n14\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.310\nin earlier versions of Exchange, the\nsolution to this was to set up a cluster.\n\n15\n00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.754\nWell, the problem with\na cluster is it's complex.\n\n16\n00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:48.990\nYou have to have shared storage.\n\n17\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.087\nYou have to have expensive hardware.\n\n18\n00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:55.925\nIdeally, you'll have a fiber attached SAN,\nand that kind of stuff,\n\n19\n00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:58.796\nit really is just complex and expensive.\n\n20\n00:00:58.796 --> 00:01:01.590\nIn Exchange 2013 and\neven in Exchange 2010,\n\n21\n00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.950\nwe got database availability groups\nthat make things a heck of a lot easier.\n\n22\n00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.170\nIt uses some of the same\nsoftware as the regular failover\n\n23\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.970\ncluster services in Windows.\n\n24\n00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.560\nBut it doesn't need all\nthe fancy hardware.\n\n25\n00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.513\nWhat a database availability\ngroup allows us to do,\n\n26\n00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:19.545\nis to store an email database\non more than one server.\n\n27\n00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.280\nIn fact, you can store it on\nup to 16 servers if you want.\n\n28\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.560\nNow only one of those\nservers is gonna be active.\n\n29\n00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.840\nAll the others are gonna be standby.\n\n30\n00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.504\nAnd when one fails, the other\nservers can automatically take over.\n\n31\n00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:34.786\nIt's automatic,\nwe don't have to do anything, and\n\n32\n00:01:34.786 --> 00:01:36.470\nwe don't have to have shared storage.\n\n33\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.504\nNow, there's pros and cons to that, right?\n\n34\n00:01:38.504 --> 00:01:40.490\nOn the positive side,\nwe don't have to have shared storage.\n\n35\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.840\nThat means all the hardware and\ncomplexity is kind of out of this.\n\n36\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.587\nOn a negative side, it means we're\nstoring multiple copies of the database.\n\n37\n00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:52.942\nSo if our email database is 1 TB in size,\nI'm gonna need a TB of storage on each of\n\n38\n00:01:52.942 --> 00:01:56.010\nthe nodes inside of that\ndatabase availability group.\n\n39\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.916\nNow, if you're just trying\nto set up two nodes,\n\n40\n00:01:57.916 --> 00:01:59.462\nthat's not that big of a deal, right?\n\n41\n00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:00.540\nYou have that storage.\n\n42\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.340\nBut if you wanna set up more, it does\nstart to require extra storage there, so\n\n43\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.730\nwe have to be aware of that.\n\n44\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.770\nThe other thing is when email comes in,\nthat email has to be\n\n45\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.470\nreplicated to the other copy of\nthe database to keep them in lockstep.\n\n46\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.100\nSo there's gonna be replication\noccurring between the database servers.\n\n47\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.310\nFortunately, email is\nreally easy to replicate.\n\n48\n00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.890\nYou might remember from some of\nthe earlier episodes where I talked about\n\n49\n00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.650\nthe mailbox database and\nthe files that build it up, and\n\n50\n00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.520\nhow we have transaction logs.\n\n51\n00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.320\nAnd the transaction logs\nare all 1 MB in size.\n\n52\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.390\nSo when I talk about replicating,\nit's really just copying these 1 MB files\n\n53\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.505\nacross to this other server to\nmaintain that database copy.\n\n54\n00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:39.980\nIt's not that big of a deal.\n\n55\n00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.830\nAnd as a result, database availability\ngroups have a real low barrier of entry.\n\n56\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.600\nEven small businesses can afford to\nimplement these cuz they're not that\n\n57\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.812\ncomplex, and\nyou don't need special hardware.\n\n58\n00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:53.110\nAll right, well,\nlet me show you how this works.\n\n59\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.850\nSo here I am, logged into my\nExchange Administration Center.\n\n60\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.550\nAnd I've only got a couple of mailboxes,\nright, nothing too special here.\n\n61\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.086\nAnd if I dive down to Servers, you'll\nsee I've got two servers that are in my\n\n62\n00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:07.010\nenvironment, LAB-EXCHANGE server 1 and\nLAB-EXCHANGE server 2.\n\n63\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.460\nAnd both of those servers are mailbox and\nclient access servers.\n\n64\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.750\nNow, database availability groups only\nmake an email database redundant.\n\n65\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.280\nThey don't do anything for\nthe client access servers.\n\n66\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.740\nSo when I talk about a database\navailability group, that's redundancy for\n\n67\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.680\nthe mailbox server role.\n\n68\n00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.730\nIf I have a client access server,\nI need something else for that, and\n\n69\n00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.240\nwe usually do network load balancing or\nWindows load balancing services.\n\n70\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.520\nThat will make a client\naccess server redundant.\n\n71\n00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.150\nWe'll cover that in another episode.\n\n72\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.720\nBut right now we're gonna\nfocus on the mailbox database.\n\n73\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.504\nIf you want to do a database availability\ngroup, you're gonna have to have at least\n\n74\n00:03:40.504 --> 00:03:43.004\ntwo servers that are running\nthe mailbox server role.\n\n75\n00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:46.690\nSo I've already got those two servers,\nI'm ready to rock, all right.\n\n76\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.550\nI'm also going to need\na database to replicate.\n\n77\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.080\nNow you can replicate as many databases\nas you want, and when you created these\n\n78\n00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.760\nmailbox servers, well, they likely already\nhave a mailbox database created on them.\n\n79\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.110\nSo if I go under my databases, I'll\nsee I've got those two kind of generic\n\n80\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.060\nmailbox databases that were\nmade during the install, which\n\n81\n00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.830\nare just called Mailbox Database and then\nsome kind of random set of numbers, right.\n\n82\n00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.090\nBut you can make your own\nmailbox databases redundant too.\n\n83\n00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.470\nOne key thing we have to remember is\nwhatever the file path is on the first\n\n84\n00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.720\nserver has to exist on the second server.\n\n85\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.967\nSo for example, if I chose to put my\ngame database on my E drive, right, so\n\n86\n00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:25.004\nE:/ whatever.\n\n87\n00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:26.755\nMaybe I'll get some extra RAID array.\n\n88\n00:04:26.755 --> 00:04:29.795\nI would need to create an E\ndrive on the other system.\n\n89\n00:04:29.795 --> 00:04:31.762\nIt doesn't have to be the same\nRAID array technology,\n\n90\n00:04:31.762 --> 00:04:33.921\nit doesn't have to be on the same SAN or\nanything like that.\n\n91\n00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:35.600\nIt just, there has to be an E drive.\n\n92\n00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.068\nBecause it's gonna replicate, and\n\n93\n00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.970\nit's gonna expect those\nfile paths to be the same.\n\n94\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.421\nSo I'm gonna add in a quick database here.\n\n95\n00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:44.756\nI'm just going to call this\nmy Sales mailbox database.\n\n96\n00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:47.970\nSo all my salespeople, they're\ngonna have mailboxes right in here.\n\n97\n00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.410\nAnd for the server I can just pick\nwhich server I want it to reside on.\n\n98\n00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.547\nI'll leave it here on EXCHANGESERV01.\n\n99\n00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:58.390\nAnd the default path is to put it on the C\ndrive inside of the Exchange install.\n\n100\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.610\nAnd I'm gonna leave it that way because\nI know that path exists on both servers.\n\n101\n00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.130\nBut if I wanted to move it somewhere else,\n\n102\n00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.740\nI would just need to make sure the path\nexisted in both places, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.390\nI'll go ahead and save that, and\nnow I've got a database created.\n\n104\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.546\nNow that database is only stored on\nLAB-EXCHANGESERV01, and that's it, right?\n\n105\n00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:18.250\nThat's where I chose to create it.\n\n106\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.430\nAnd if I start moving mailboxes into it,\n\n107\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.340\nthey're just gonna be right there\non that server in that one place.\n\n108\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.120\nAnd if that database goes offline?\n\n109\n00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.338\nThey don't have access to the mailbox.\n\n110\n00:05:27.338 --> 00:05:31.991\nNow, just because the database is offline\ndoesn't mean that we lose access to that\n\n111\n00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.150\nresource, right.\n\n112\n00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.830\nWe're not losing email.\n\n113\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.440\nEmail comes in, it just stays in the queue\nuntil the mailbox database comes online.\n\n114\n00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.360\nBut the user can't get to their mailbox,\nand so\n\n115\n00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.470\nthat's just as bad as losing email, right.\n\n116\n00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.240\nThey think they've lost everything.\n\n117\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.090\nSo we definitely wanna\nmake that redundant.\n\n118\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.720\nBut when you create one,\nyou'll see here SERVERS WITH COPIES.\n\n119\n00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.650\nI've only got one server, that's it.\n\n120\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.360\nSo there's no redundancy\nintroduced by this\n\n121\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.840\noutside of what your\nhardware might provide.\n\n122\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.580\nSo my next step is gonna be to set\nup the database availability group.\n\n123\n00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.088\nNow, there's a couple of things that we\nneed to do before we just dive right in.\n\n124\n00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:05.716\nCuz you could just jump right over\nto database availability groups,\n\n125\n00:06:05.716 --> 00:06:07.850\nhit that plus sign, and get to work.\n\n126\n00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.650\nBut it's not gonna work.\n\n127\n00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.028\nYou're gonna have some problems.\n\n128\n00:06:10.028 --> 00:06:11.350\nSo I wanna go through and\n\n129\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.450\ndo a couple of extra things to\nmake sure that I'm set in place.\n\n130\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.820\nFirst off, I need to make sure that\nI have permission to do this, right?\n\n131\n00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.450\nI need to have access to create\ndatabase availability groups.\n\n132\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.970\nAnd so the way we do that is we use one of\nthe roles that's built here into Exchange.\n\n133\n00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.940\nThere's a role called organization\nmanagement, and we need to have that role.\n\n134\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.504\nSo over here in my admin center,\nI'm just gonna browse down to permissions.\n\n135\n00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:37.879\nAnd inside of permissions,\nI've got my admin roles.\n\n136\n00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.060\nAnd you can find organization\nmanagement right there, and\n\n137\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.610\nthis is gonna be a kind of a roll\nup of various other roles.\n\n138\n00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.640\nAnd I just need to make sure that\nI have that permission, right.\n\n139\n00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.370\nSo, in the active directory there's\nactually an Exchange organization\n\n140\n00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.650\nadministrators group, and\nwe can put ourselves in that group and\n\n141\n00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.070\nhave that permission.\n\n142\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.800\nIf I edit that organization management,\nI can look in here and\n\n143\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.560\nI can see not only what that role is,\nbut the roles that it possesses.\n\n144\n00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.810\nAnd that's really the key piece is there's\ntwo true roles that I really need.\n\n145\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.000\nIf you look in here,\nyou can find them pretty easy.\n\n146\n00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.580\nThere's database availability groups and\ndatabase copies.\n\n147\n00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.740\nDatabase availability groups,\n\n148\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.030\nthat's what gives you\nthe permission to create the DAG.\n\n149\n00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.270\nAnd then database copies,\n\n150\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.760\nthat's what gives you the permission to\nclone the database and put that in place.\n\n151\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.506\nSo if I wanted to create a custom role\nthat allowed somebody to set up these DAGs\n\n152\n00:07:27.506 --> 00:07:31.463\nwell, I would need to add these\ntwo roles to the role that I made.\n\n153\n00:07:31.463 --> 00:07:33.692\nAnd then right down here,\nI can see the members, and\n\n154\n00:07:33.692 --> 00:07:35.220\nI can see that I am already a member.\n\n155\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.660\nSo Don Pezet, I'm in there.\n\n156\n00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.730\nIf I was doing this as a different user,\nI'd need to add that to this list so\n\n157\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.760\nthat I could set up the DAGs.\n\n158\n00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.910\nAll right, so I'm good there.\n\n159\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.510\nThe other thing is I need to think\nabout my domain controllers, all right?\n\n160\n00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:53.231\nIf you're running Exchange on top of\nWindows Server 2012, you're fine.\n\n161\n00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:55.170\nYou can go and create the DAGs right now.\n\n162\n00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.305\nBut if you're running Exchange on\ntop of Windows Server 2008, Or\n\n163\n00:07:58.305 --> 00:08:02.292\nif it's on top of Windows Server 2012 and\nyou're domain controllers are 2008,\n\n164\n00:08:02.292 --> 00:08:05.236\nthen there's a little\nextra work we have to do.\n\n165\n00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:06.990\nWhen you create a DAG,\n\n166\n00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.980\nit's actually creating a type of failover\ncluster in the background, all right?\n\n167\n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.160\nSo I've gotta make sure that\nit is has a server object\n\n168\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.630\ncreated in the active directory for that.\n\n169\n00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.470\nAnd in 2012 it would've created\nautomatically, it's no big deal.\n\n170\n00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.430\nBut in 2008 it doesn't\ncreate it automatically, so\n\n171\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.470\nwe're gonna have to create it, all right?\n\n172\n00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.320\nNow when I say it's gonna\ncreate a cluster server object,\n\n173\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.810\nwhen you have a cluster, you have two or\nmore machines in a cluster and\n\n174\n00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.610\nthey create virtual server,\na fake server, right?\n\n175\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.660\nA server that doesn't really exist, but\n\n176\n00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.700\nit's the server that you're\ngonna point all your clients to.\n\n177\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.290\nAnd if one node fails that virtual\nserver kinda hops over to another node.\n\n178\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.910\nAnd if it fails it hops\nover to another node.\n\n179\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.910\nAnd it can do that across up to 16 nodes.\n\n180\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.690\nSo you can have many,\n\n181\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.440\nmany servers that are all able\nto handle this virtual entity.\n\n182\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.790\nSo if I'm in 2012,\ndon't worry about that, right?\n\n183\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.270\nJust put it out of your mind.\n\n184\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.430\nBut if I'm in 2008 I need to create\nthat virtual entity first, all right?\n\n185\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.750\nAnd the easiest way to do that is to\njump over to a domain controller.\n\n186\n00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.310\nSo I'm gonna jump to my domain\ncontroller and I'm on 2012, but\n\n187\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.860\nI'm gonna go ahead and create this anyway.\n\n188\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.830\nAnd so I'm gonna jump in here and I'm\ngonna go into Active Directory Users and\n\n189\n00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.730\nComputers.\n\n190\n00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:16.062\nAnd what I need to do is I need to\ncreate a computer object that is gonna\n\n191\n00:09:16.062 --> 00:09:18.197\nrepresent this virtual server.\n\n192\n00:09:18.197 --> 00:09:21.218\nAnd I need to assign some permissions\nto that computer object so\n\n193\n00:09:21.218 --> 00:09:24.760\nthat Exchange will be allowed to work\nwith it and then I need to disable it.\n\n194\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.730\nIts gotta be disabled so\nthe cluster can take it over.\n\n195\n00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.060\nSo, you can really go\ninto any OU you want.\n\n196\n00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.808\nI'm gonna stick with my\ndefault computer's container.\n\n197\n00:09:32.808 --> 00:09:36.930\nAnd I'm gonna create a new computer,\nand you want to give it a name.\n\n198\n00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.230\nNow this is going to be the servers\nthat your end users see.\n\n199\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.480\nThe end users aren't going to see\nthe individual servers anymore,\n\n200\n00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.240\nthey're going to see this one entity.\n\n201\n00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.100\nSo think of a nice generic name.\n\n202\n00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:53.865\nAll of my servers, I've been naming\nthem LAB-EXCHSERV01 or 02 or 03.\n\n203\n00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:56.400\nBut users don't care about\nhow many servers I've got.\n\n204\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.040\nThey just wanna connect to Exchange.\n\n205\n00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.057\nSo I might call this LAB-EXCHANGE.\n\n206\n00:10:01.057 --> 00:10:03.020\nAnd so now they know,\nhey that's the Exchange server.\n\n207\n00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.330\nThat's what I need to point out for\nmy mailbox database or whatever, right.\n\n208\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.400\nSo you can give it a name,\nwhatever you want.\n\n209\n00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.362\nI'll call mine LAB-MAILBOX.\n\n210\n00:10:11.362 --> 00:10:15.270\nAll right, so this is gonna be my\nmailbox database cluster entity.\n\n211\n00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.100\nAll right, I'll go ahead and\n\n212\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.670\nsay OK to get that created, then I\nneed to adjust some permissions on it.\n\n213\n00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.570\nNow, when you go into\nActive Directory Users and\n\n214\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.810\nComputers, the default view doesn't\nactually show every thing that we need.\n\n215\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.670\nSo you need to make sure you go up\nhere to View and Advanced Features and\n\n216\n00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.290\nturn that on.\n\n217\n00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:36.630\nAnd when that's turned on, you can pull\nup the properties for an object and\n\n218\n00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.240\nyou'll have your Security tab up here.\n\n219\n00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.910\nAnd in Security, I need to add\n\n220\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.900\na special Exchange group to this to give\nExchange Server permission to manage this.\n\n221\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:52.329\nSo, I'm gonna hit Add, and I'm gonna\nadd in the Exchange Trusted Subsystem.\n\n222\n00:10:52.329 --> 00:10:54.825\nI'll just do a Check Name to make\nsure I typed it right there.\n\n223\n00:10:54.825 --> 00:10:55.775\nYou can browse and find it too.\n\n224\n00:10:55.775 --> 00:10:58.115\nBut it's called\nExchange Trusted Subsystem.\n\n225\n00:10:58.115 --> 00:11:01.043\nAnd that's what's gonna give Exchange\nthe rights to manage this object.\n\n226\n00:11:01.043 --> 00:11:03.072\nAnd I'll go go ahead and say OK to that.\n\n227\n00:11:04.172 --> 00:11:07.902\nAnd so now I've got that computer,\nthat virtual server created,\n\n228\n00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:11.372\nI've given Exchange permissions,\nand now I need to disable it.\n\n229\n00:11:11.372 --> 00:11:13.072\nI forget this step all the time,\n\n230\n00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:15.916\nwell I guess I remember it now because\nI've forgotten gotten it so many times.\n\n231\n00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:17.706\nThe wizard will fail if it's enabled,\n\n232\n00:11:17.706 --> 00:11:20.166\nbecause it assumes there's\na real computer attached to it.\n\n233\n00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:22.976\nBut if it's disabled, it knows that\nit's available to be taken over.\n\n234\n00:11:22.976 --> 00:11:26.276\nSo, I'm just gonna right click on that and\nchoose to disable it.\n\n235\n00:11:26.276 --> 00:11:27.846\nWe'll disable that account.\n\n236\n00:11:27.846 --> 00:11:29.726\nAnd so now I've got lab-mailbox and\n\n237\n00:11:29.726 --> 00:11:31.916\nit's got a little down arrow on it,\nit's disabled.\n\n238\n00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.420\nNow, remember, if you're in\n2012 you don't have to do this.\n\n239\n00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.850\nBut if you're on Windows Server 2008,\nthat's where you have to do this.\n\n240\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.053\nIf your domain controllers\nare Windows Server 2008 you've\n\n241\n00:11:45.053 --> 00:11:48.280\ngot to pre-stage the cluster object.\n\n242\n00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.370\nSo now that I'm pre-staged,\nI'm ready to go.\n\n243\n00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.060\nNow I can actually go in and\ncreate that database availability group.\n\n244\n00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.050\nSo here on my Exchange server,\nI'm just going to go down to Servers, and\n\n245\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.360\nDatabase Availability Groups,\nand I'm going to create one.\n\n246\n00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.260\nSo I'll hit the plus sign\nhere to create the group.\n\n247\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.360\nAnd when I create it,\nI need to give it a name and\n\n248\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.740\nthe name is what's going to become\nthat virtual server object.\n\n249\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.286\nSo if I haven't created that object yet,\nI can type whatever I want here.\n\n250\n00:12:13.286 --> 00:12:18.199\nBut if I've already pre-staged it, I've\ngotta make sure I type in the same name,\n\n251\n00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:20.270\nso I'm gonna type LAB-MAILBOX.\n\n252\n00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.880\nAnd it's gonna look to\nthe active directory for\n\n253\n00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.550\nthat object to try and find it, and\nif it's disabled, it'll use it.\n\n254\n00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.710\nIf it doesn't exist, it'll try and\ncreate it, which will work in 2012, but\n\n255\n00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.790\nwill fail in 2008.\n\n256\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.580\nAll right,\nthen we need to specify a witness server.\n\n257\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.770\nNow, what is a witness server?\n\n258\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:41.390\nWell when you have a cluster, what happens\nis you'll have one node that's active and\n\n259\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.470\nall the other nodes are in standby.\n\n260\n00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.510\nAnd the other nodes are sitting there and\nthey're waiting and they're saying hm.\n\n261\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.690\nLet me wait and see if the active\nguy fails, and then I'll take over.\n\n262\n00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.220\nWell, how do they know\nif the active guy fails?\n\n263\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.750\nThey can't see him anymore, right?\n\n264\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.590\nThey're sending these\nlittle heart beat messages.\n\n265\n00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:56.830\nThey're kinda like pings.\n\n266\n00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.890\nThese little communicas that go back and\nforth between the active server and\n\n267\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.310\nall the standbys.\n\n268\n00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.700\nAnd if those communicas\nstop communicating,\n\n269\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.130\nif it stops receiving them,\nwe assume the main server failed.\n\n270\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.520\nAnd then it's time to take over.\n\n271\n00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.440\nBut what is a reason why we might not\nbe able to see that other server?\n\n272\n00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.690\nIt could be the server failed, right?\n\n273\n00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.200\nIt could be that it actually failed,\nand yes, we need to take over.\n\n274\n00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.390\nBut it could be my problem.\n\n275\n00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.970\nIt could be, if I'm the standby node,\nright, so there's an active node and\n\n276\n00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.510\nI'm the standby node,\nit could be that my network card failed.\n\n277\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.540\nAnd I can't see the network and that's\nwhy I can't talk to the active one, so\n\n278\n00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.680\nI shouldn't go active because\nI'm the one with the problem.\n\n279\n00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.770\nSo we need some way to get a consistent\n\n280\n00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.570\nopinion of whether\nthe network is actually down.\n\n281\n00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:45.310\nIf you have an odd number of servers,\nso like if I have three servers, and\n\n282\n00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.930\nI think the main one went down,\nI can ask the third server.\n\n283\n00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.880\nI can say, hey,\ndoes the main one look down for you too?\n\n284\n00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.990\nAnd if the other one says oh yeah,\nhe's down, then you're both in agreement.\n\n285\n00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.570\nYou have what's called a quorum.\n\n286\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.470\nA quorum is when you\nbasically take a vote and\n\n287\n00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.400\nyou guys agree that yes\nthe main server is down.\n\n288\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.150\nAnd so, we can go ahead and\ntake action on that.\n\n289\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.810\nBut, if we reach out to\nthat other server and\n\n290\n00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.600\nsay hey is the main server down for\nyou to?\n\n291\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.180\nAnd the other server says no it's up,\nthen I know it's my problem and\n\n292\n00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.620\nI shouldn't go active.\n\n293\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.100\nWith an odd number of servers,\nthat works really well.\n\n294\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.860\nBut what if you have\nan even number of servers?\n\n295\n00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.570\nIf you only have two servers, and\n\n296\n00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.980\nthe main one looks like it failed,\nthere's nobody else for me to talk to.\n\n297\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.970\nI can't find out whether or\nnot that server is up.\n\n298\n00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.710\nAll right, if I have four servers,\nor six servers, or\n\n299\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.850\neight servers,\nthere's the possibility I could get a tie.\n\n300\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.920\nWith an odd number of servers\nthere's never a tie, right?\n\n301\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.020\nBut with an even number of\nservers you can have a tie.\n\n302\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.910\nSo we need something else.\n\n303\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.360\nSomething that can serve as that tie\nbreaker, or that I can vote against,\n\n304\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.320\neven if I don't have another Exchange\nserver out there to talk to.\n\n305\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.840\nAnd that's what a witness is.\n\n306\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.120\nSo a witness is that server\nthat'll act as a tie breaker.\n\n307\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.876\nNow It can be any server.\n\n308\n00:14:51.876 --> 00:14:54.134\nIt can actually be a workstation,\nbut you really shouldn't do that.\n\n309\n00:14:54.134 --> 00:14:56.934\n[LAUGH] It can be any server in\nyour environment that can share\n\n310\n00:14:56.934 --> 00:14:58.170\na folder, right?\n\n311\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.640\nAll the witness does is\nit holds a shared folder.\n\n312\n00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.710\nAnd those heartbeats that I mentioned,\n\n313\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.280\nthey're just these little timestamp files\nthat it rights to that heartbeat folder,\n\n314\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.425\nto the folder that's going\non this witness server.\n\n315\n00:15:07.425 --> 00:15:09.500\nAnd that witness serves as the tiebreaker.\n\n316\n00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.220\nNow, if you have an odd number of servers,\nthe witness gets ignored,\n\n317\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.960\nand it doesn't matter, right?\n\n318\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.100\nBut if you have an even number of servers,\nthat witness is really important, so\n\n319\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.260\nMicrosoft makes us put one in here,\nall right?\n\n320\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.850\nSo I need to specify who that\nwitness server is gonna be.\n\n321\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.050\nNow, it's really important that\nit not be a mailbox server, okay?\n\n322\n00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.380\nDo not specify another mailbox server\nthat might participate in the DAG.\n\n323\n00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.210\nIt's gotta be somebody outside of the DAG,\nall right?\n\n324\n00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.580\nSo it should be,\nit could be a client access server.\n\n325\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.200\nThat's usually what I do is just pick\na client access server and use it.\n\n326\n00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.870\nOr it could be a domain controller.\n\n327\n00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.700\nIt could be another\nserver on your network.\n\n328\n00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.470\nSo you can kinda pick whatever you want.\n\n329\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:48.147\nI've got another server sitting off here\nto the sidelines which is LAB-EXCHSERV03,\n\n330\n00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:49.670\nand I'll use that one.\n\n331\n00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.049\nThat's where I'm gonna put my witness.\n\n332\n00:15:51.049 --> 00:15:54.311\nAll right, now the witness really\nis just a shared folder, so\n\n333\n00:15:54.311 --> 00:15:56.709\nit gives me the option\nto type in a directory.\n\n334\n00:15:56.709 --> 00:15:57.489\nI'm not gonna do that.\n\n335\n00:15:57.489 --> 00:16:00.789\nI'm gonna leave it blank And if you\nleave it blank it just uses the default.\n\n336\n00:16:00.789 --> 00:16:04.700\nOn the C drive it'll create a folder,\nit's called, I always forget the name.\n\n337\n00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.730\nIt's like D-A-G something.\n\n338\n00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.470\nWell, we'll see it when it gets created.\n\n339\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.400\nIt's like D-A-G failover witness share or\nsomething like that.\n\n340\n00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.500\nBut it's a folder and\nit'll start writing timestamps to that.\n\n341\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.810\nAnd I'm cool with the default.\n\n342\n00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.290\nIt's not like high disk IO or\n\n343\n00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.790\nanything like that so we don't really\nhave to worry about it too much.\n\n344\n00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.950\nAll right, so I'm gonna have a virtual\nserver called Lab Dash Mailbox.\n\n345\n00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.300\nThe next thing they're gonna ask for\nis an IP address for that server.\n\n346\n00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.070\nIf people wanna see the virtual server,\nthey have to have an IP to connect to it,\n\n347\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.390\nso I need to give it an IP\naddress that's on my network.\n\n348\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.990\nNow, you can really pick\njust about any address, but\n\n349\n00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.930\nit needs to be an address that's\nreachable by every node in the cluster.\n\n350\n00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.770\nSo I'm gonna be adding Lab Exchange Server\n1 and Lab Exchange Server 2\n\n351\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.612\ninto this cluster,\nthey both have 192.168.0 addresses, so\n\n352\n00:16:50.612 --> 00:16:54.725\nI need to make sure that this\nshared IP is in that range, and so\n\n353\n00:16:54.725 --> 00:16:57.730\nI'll set this one to be, we'll do 222.\n\n354\n00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.614\nThis is what I forget, too, if you just\nhit Save, it'll actually blank out the IP,\n\n355\n00:17:01.614 --> 00:17:03.500\nand you won't end up with an IP address.\n\n356\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.130\nYou gotta make sure you actually hit\nthe plus sign to add it to this list,\n\n357\n00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.170\ncuz you could add more\nthan one IP if you wanted.\n\n358\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.300\nAll right I'm gonna go ahead and\nsave that, and\n\n359\n00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.490\nthat's gonna create the database\navailability group.\n\n360\n00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.580\nNow I hit an error on mine, right?\n\n361\n00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.360\nSo I get it was unable to create it,\n\n362\n00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.139\nunable to create the default witness\ndirectory on LAB-EXCHSERV03.\n\n363\n00:17:22.139 --> 00:17:23.950\nAll right, now why is that?\n\n364\n00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.350\nWell, the reason it failed, is that I\nforgot a step, it's kind of important.\n\n365\n00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:32.010\nI mentioned that LabExchangeServ03\nthat it has sitting on the sidelines,\n\n366\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.350\nif it was an Exchange Server,\nthis would have worked just fine.\n\n367\n00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.300\nBut I haven't installed Exchange\non it yet, you might have noticed\n\n368\n00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.330\nwhen I was back in my server list that\nI had Lab Exchange Server zero one and\n\n369\n00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.552\nzero two I didn't have zero three.\n\n370\n00:17:42.552 --> 00:17:45.600\nAll right and that's because\n03 I have an install exchange.\n\n371\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.740\nIt's just a regular server\nsitting right here.\n\n372\n00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.880\nSo here's that server,\nwhoops, which I just locked.\n\n373\n00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.040\nSo here's that server it's just sitting\nhere and it's not an Exchange Server.\n\n374\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.770\nAnd as a result Exchange doesn't have\npermission to set up the file share on it.\n\n375\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.690\nSo I need to make a quick\nchange to this server.\n\n376\n00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.270\nI'm gonna go up here into Tools and\nComputer Management.\n\n377\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.440\nI'm in the Server Manager, so\nI'll go to Tools and Computer Management.\n\n378\n00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.000\nI'll go to Local Users and\nGroups and Groups, and\n\n379\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.800\nI'm gonna take the local administrator's\ngroup on that server and\n\n380\n00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.930\nI'm gonna add in the Exchange\ntrusted subsystem.\n\n381\n00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.600\nYou guys might remember that one.\n\n382\n00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.210\nWhen you install Exchange,\n\n383\n00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.000\nit automatically adds this to the local\nadministrators' group of that server,\n\n384\n00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.930\nif I'd installed Exchange here,\nthat would have happened.\n\n385\n00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.870\nBut because this is just a member\nserver joined to the domain, and\n\n386\n00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.470\nit's not running Exchange, I need to\ngive Exchange permission to manage it.\n\n387\n00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.530\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n388\n00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.650\nSo I'll go ahead and set that value.\n\n389\n00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.810\nSo now Exchange has permission\nto manage the server and\n\n390\n00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:47.230\nif I go back to my wizard here,\nI can try this again and I'll hit Save.\n\n391\n00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.910\nAnd this time it should be able\nto reach out to that server and\n\n392\n00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.030\ncreate that witness folder.\n\n393\n00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.930\nAnd there we go, I can see that it did.\n\n394\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:53.930\nI can go verify, right?\n\n395\n00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.010\nIf I jump over to that server and\n\n396\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.490\nI browse to it's C: Drive,\nthere it is, DAG file share witness.\n\n397\n00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:01.810\nThat's the folder that it just made.\n\n398\n00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:03.200\nAnd it's probably empty.\n\n399\n00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.630\nYeah it's empty right now, and\n\n400\n00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.940\nthat's because I haven't added\nany servers to the DAG yet.\n\n401\n00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.070\nThe DAG has no member servers.\n\n402\n00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.750\nSo now I just need to add\nthe servers to it, okay.\n\n403\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.900\nSo you can choose the DAG, and you've got\na button up here with a little gear on it,\n\n404\n00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.860\nand that's what's gonna let\nus manage the DAG membership.\n\n405\n00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.300\nHere's where you can add servers\nto the availability group.\n\n406\n00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.930\nSo I'm gonna choose that, and\nI'm just gonna add in my servers.\n\n407\n00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.930\nNow, In real life land, I'd pick all\nmy servers at once and add them in, but\n\n408\n00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.960\nI'm in some virtual machines here, and\nthis process can be a little intensive, so\n\n409\n00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.880\nI'm going to do them one at a time.\n\n410\n00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.380\nAnd the reason it's intensive,\nis when I add this server, so\n\n411\n00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.360\nI'm adding Lab Exchange Server 01, when I\nadd that server, it's going to reach out\n\n412\n00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:49.800\nto the server and it's going to install\nthe failover cluster feature, right?\n\n413\n00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.510\nSo it's got to install that\nfeature on the server,\n\n414\n00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.410\nit's got to do a little bit of work\nthere to get that in place, and\n\n415\n00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.610\nonce it's done,\nthat system will join the cluster.\n\n416\n00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.500\nAlright so I got an error here,\nand if I take a look at it,\n\n417\n00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.480\nlet's see what it's telling me.\n\n418\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.250\nIt's on the create cluster errors may\nresult from incorrectly configured static\n\n419\n00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.590\naddresses And then it says\nthe computer account, lab-mailbox,\n\n420\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.250\ncould not be validated, access was denied.\n\n421\n00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:14.800\nNow, that's an odd error to get, because\nwe added the Exchange trusted subsystem to\n\n422\n00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.265\nthat account, but you know what,\nI forgot something.\n\n423\n00:20:17.265 --> 00:20:20.260\nWe We added the account, but didn't\nactually grant it any permissions, and\n\n424\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.650\nthat means that it got read-only.\n\n425\n00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.050\nSo I need to go and\nfix the Active Directory permissions and\n\n426\n00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.080\nthat'll take care of this error.\n\n427\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.480\nSo let me just jump back over to my AD and\n\n428\n00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.180\nI'm gonna take that lab dash mailbox\nvirtual server that we made.\n\n429\n00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.880\nI'll pull up its properties.\n\n430\n00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.980\nWe'll go under security.\n\n431\n00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.080\nAnd we'll find that exchange\ntrusted sub-system.\n\n432\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.260\nIt'll be in here.\n\n433\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.400\nThere it is.\n\n434\n00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.280\nAnd notice under Exchange trusted\nsubsystem I granted access, but\n\n435\n00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.960\nit's only got read only.\n\n436\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.070\nI need to give it full\ncontrol of this object.\n\n437\n00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.250\nIt has to be able to take\ncontrol of this object and\n\n438\n00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.280\nchange things like its password, so\nI'm gonna grant that permission,\n\n439\n00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.930\nand that should take care\nof our error right there.\n\n440\n00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.030\nAll right, so while that's running, and\ninstead of sitting here waiting and\n\n441\n00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.400\nwatching the little menu bars here.\n\n442\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.620\nWe'll let that churn along, and\nI'll add that second server into the DAG.\n\n443\n00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.540\nWe still have more work to do,\nwe gotta add the databases in there, and\n\n444\n00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.750\nbuild that redundancy.\n\n445\n00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.890\nBut I am short on time on this episode so\nwhat we'll do is we'll go ahead and\n\n446\n00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.850\nwrap it up here and\nthen stay tuned for part two.\n\n447\n00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:14.770\nWith part two both our servers will be\nin that DAG and now we just need to\n\n448\n00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.370\nmove our database in there, verify\nreplication and test some failovers.\n\n449\n00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:23.440\nThere's still a lot more to go, but\nin this episode, at least we got a chance\n\n450\n00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.290\nto see how to do our pre-staging and some\nof the pre-work to get ready for the DAG.\n\n451\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.950\nWe saw how to build the DAG and get it\nin place and start to add servers to it,\n\n452\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.780\nall the initial steps of setting up\nthat database availability group.\n\n453\n00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.690\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n454\n00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.370\nStay tuned for part two.\n\n455\n00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.900\nBut for right now signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet, and I'll see you

00:00:15.021\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITproTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:16.890\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.852\nBack again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:24.420\nNow this is the exciting conclusion\nto our two part series on database\n\n7\n00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.530\navailability groups.\n\n8\n00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.160\nIf you haven't watched the other episode,\nyou definitely wanna start there,\n\n9\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.990\nbecause in that episode, we saw how to\ncreate a database availability group, and\n\n10\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.270\nsome of the prerequisites\nwe had to take care of.\n\n11\n00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.430\nAnd then we took two servers and\nwe joined them into that group.\n\n12\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.550\nNow, when we did that, it kicked off\na process where it was enabling those\n\n13\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.970\nservers in the DAG, which is basically\ninstalling the fail over cluster roll and\n\n14\n00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.370\nsetting them up,\nattaching them to the file share witness.\n\n15\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.800\nBut graphically,\n\n16\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.550\nit's just watching a little blue\nbar crawling across the screen.\n\n17\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.210\nSo we wrap that episode up.\n\n18\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.400\nAnd we're picking right\nback up where we left off.\n\n19\n00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.270\nSo in the interim, those little blue bars?\n\n20\n00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.410\nThey made it to the other\nside of the screen and so\n\n21\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.880\nthat's where we're at right now.\n\n22\n00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.030\nOur two servers should now be\nsuccessfully in our DAG, but\n\n23\n00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.050\nlet's verify that just to make\nsure it did complete successfully.\n\n24\n00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.330\nSo, let's take a look at my computer here\nand if I go in my exchange admin center\n\n25\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.470\nand I jump down to servers and I see my\nservers there, they're all happy, and\n\n26\n00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.200\nthen if I jump over to my database\navailability groups, what I'm hoping to\n\n27\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.390\nsee is when I look at my DAG,\nI should now have the two servers listed.\n\n28\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.290\nOr if you just added one and\nyou're kinda waiting on the other one,\n\n29\n00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.260\nthen you'll just see the one, but\nI can see I've got Exchange Server 1 and\n\n30\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.320\nExchange Server 2 listed right there.\n\n31\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.300\nSo I've got them, they're in place.\n\n32\n00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.810\nI can see the witness server is listed\nalso there's Lab Exchange Server 03.\n\n33\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.600\nI've got a database available group,\nso we're ready to rock right?\n\n34\n00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.640\nNow I have a DAG, but\nthe DAG is currently empty.\n\n35\n00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.430\nIf I click on it, you'll see some\ninformation over here that shows\n\n36\n00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.160\nthe member servers, the witness server,\ninformation about the DAG network.\n\n37\n00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.960\nIt's there, I've got a DAG,\nbut nobody's using it.\n\n38\n00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.886\nThe next step is to actually take\na database and attach it to the DAG.\n\n39\n00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:07.070\nNow, technically [LAUGH] technically,\nany mailbox database that resides\n\n40\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.770\non one of these two servers is technically\npart of the DAG, but it's not redundant.\n\n41\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.290\nIt's only on that one server,\nand let me show you what I mean.\n\n42\n00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.110\nIf I go to databases,\nI've got my sales database, and\n\n43\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.150\nsales database resides on\nthe Lab Exchange Server 01.\n\n44\n00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.800\nAnd Lab Exchange Server 01\none is part of the DAG, so\n\n45\n00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.820\ntechnically this database\nis part of the DAG.\n\n46\n00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.070\nBut if I look at this servers with copy,\nthere's only server.\n\n47\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.500\nThere's only a copy of it\non Lab Exchange Server 01.\n\n48\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.760\nSo, just having the database\non the server in a DAG,\n\n49\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.780\nI've got to add a copy before\nits actually redundant.\n\n50\n00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.090\nAnd that's my next step, is I'm going\nto take a database like this one and\n\n51\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.930\nI'll just highlight it,\nI'll hit the ellipsis button up here and\n\n52\n00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.430\nyou'll have an add database copy option.\n\n53\n00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.970\nAll right?\n\n54\n00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.010\nNow add database copy doesn't\nwork until you have a DAG, right?\n\n55\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.160\nSo you gotta create the DAG first\nlike we did in the last episode,\n\n56\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.030\nnow we add the database to\nit now the cool part here\n\n57\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.700\nis we can do this while our\nusers are in the system.\n\n58\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.350\nIt doesn't effect them,\nit's making a clone of the database.\n\n59\n00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.050\nSo what it actually does is in the\nbackground it's gonna run volume shadow\n\n60\n00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.560\ncopy, it's gonna take a snapshot of\nthe database as it is right now and\n\n61\n00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.560\nit's gonna send that\nover to the other node.\n\n62\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.640\nNow if that database\nis a terabyte in size,\n\n63\n00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.290\nit's gonna copy a terabyte of data across\nthe network, it's gonna take a while.\n\n64\n00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.440\nIf it's 50 megs in size,\nit's gonna happen really fast, so\n\n65\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.790\nbe aware that building up this\ndatabase while take a while.\n\n66\n00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.740\nOnce it sends that snap chat over,\n\n67\n00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.870\nfrom then on,\nit's just copying transaction log files.\n\n68\n00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.850\nRemember that when we look\nat the database, actually,\n\n69\n00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.250\nlet me get this one copying first before\nI go off on transaction log files.\n\n70\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.630\nSo I'm gonna take that Sales Database and\nI'll hit that three dots and I'll hit\n\n71\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.630\nAdd Database Copy And it's gonna come up,\nand I can see here's my sales database.\n\n72\n00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.050\nIt currently has a copy on Exchange Server\n01, and now I can specify another server.\n\n73\n00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.240\nAnd if I browse,\nI'll see the other servers in that DAG.\n\n74\n00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.750\nAnd I can see the DAG name over here,\nLAB-MAILBOX, right?\n\n75\n00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.790\nCuz you might have more than one DAG,\nthat is possible.\n\n76\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.890\nSo I'll go ahead and\nchoose this one and hit OK.\n\n77\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.260\nAnd there is another value we need to\nspecify here which is the Activation\n\n78\n00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.890\npreference number.\n\n79\n00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.700\nIf we have a two-node cluster,\n\n80\n00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.550\nI probably have one node that I\nwant to hold the database normally.\n\n81\n00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.690\nAnd another node that acts as the backup.\n\n82\n00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.830\nMaybe I have better hardware on one and\nweaker hardware on the other, or\n\n83\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.270\nmaybe they're identical and I just have\na preference of one server, right?\n\n84\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.620\nI always want it to go to\nserver one if I can, right?\n\n85\n00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.670\nBecause then I know it's there and\nserver two's the backup.\n\n86\n00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.280\nI just wanna remember that.\n\n87\n00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.140\nI've worked in cluster environments\nwhere we didn't have preferences and\n\n88\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.960\nit was kinda, [LAUGH] it was neat but\nfrustrating at the same time.\n\n89\n00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.900\nSo I'll give you guys\na real world example.\n\n90\n00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.870\nI worked on a 16 node cluster for\nExchange.\n\n91\n00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.320\nAnd it was frustrating because\nnobody set preferences and so\n\n92\n00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.380\nwhen you came in in the morning if\nyou wanted to work on a server.\n\n93\n00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.040\nYou could connect right to that server on\nthe network if it was no big deal, but\n\n94\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.280\nif you wanted to find out where the actual\ninstance was running at that moment,\n\n95\n00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.670\nit could have been any of\nthe 16 cluster nodes, so\n\n96\n00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.780\nyou had to go into the cluster manager,\nand you had to look and\n\n97\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.940\nsee where that resource was attached,\nand you had to find it.\n\n98\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.360\nIt was like playing find\nthe server every morning.\n\n99\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.330\nSo if you set a preference\nlike this you know\n\n100\n00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.750\nwhat physical server\nit's gonna be running on.\n\n101\n00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.700\nThe first server you make automatically\ngets a preference of one.\n\n102\n00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.890\nAnd then your additional servers\nyou can go through and change them.\n\n103\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.740\nIf I pick one for this new server then\nthe other server will become two and\n\n104\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.640\nyou'll only see numbers for\nthe amount of nodes you have.\n\n105\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.870\nI only have two nodes so\nI see one and two.\n\n106\n00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.130\nIf you have 16 nodes,\nyou'll see 1 through 16, you can't have\n\n107\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.300\ntwo servers with the same preference and\nso you basically pick a number.\n\n108\n00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.800\nI'm gonna make this guy number two,\nhe'll be the backup.\n\n109\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.620\nIf I choose number one, it's gonna\ndo all the replication first, and\n\n110\n00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.710\nonly when the replication is done will\nit then fail over to number two and\n\n111\n00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.739\nthat one will become active\nas part of this process.\n\n112\n00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.240\nAnd there's a few other neat\noptions we can specify in here.\n\n113\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.710\nIf you go to more options down at the\nbottom see how I can set replay lag time?\n\n114\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.570\nRight, this we can use to set up a delay\nbetween our main database and the backup.\n\n115\n00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.440\nNow why would I want that?\n\n116\n00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.510\nNormally we don't want a delay.\n\n117\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.180\nIf I have a failure, I want to be\nable to jump over that unload to have\n\n118\n00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.140\nall of my data right up to\nthe point of failure, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.140\nWell that's true, we normally want that.\n\n120\n00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.680\nBut there's times when we don't want that,\n\n121\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.440\nwe want to be able to go back\nin time a little bit, all right?\n\n122\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.280\nNow I can give you\na great example of this.\n\n123\n00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.710\nBack in, it was probably in 2000,\nit was 15 years ago.\n\n124\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.300\nThere was the Anna Kournikova virus,\n\n125\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.270\nI think it was actually called Code Red,\nthat propagated out through email.\n\n126\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.040\nAnd let's say that your system\ngot hit by that, and for\n\n127\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.190\nwhatever reason, your malware or\nvirus protection didn't catch it and so\n\n128\n00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.250\nnow the mailboxes on your server\nare just riddled with viruses, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.910\nWell, you could go and restore\na backup from the night before, and\n\n130\n00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.260\nyou might lose some email, or\nif you had a lagged copy of your database,\n\n131\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.810\nif you had a live backup that was just\nan hour behind, or four hours behind,\n\n132\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.860\nyou could just flip over to it, and\nnow all those virus emails are gone.\n\n133\n00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.820\nYou flip over to the new one\nthat doesn't have them and\n\n134\n00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.290\nobviously you take precautions to\nmake sure you don't get it again.\n\n135\n00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.070\nSo there are times where you\nmight wanna delay on that copy.\n\n136\n00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:15.280\nWell, if I could have a three-node\ncluster, where nodes one and\n\n137\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.800\ntwo are all in real time and node three\nhas a delay, when I pick this delay,\n\n138\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.370\nthis is just the delay for the server that\nI'm adding right now, so you can actually\n\n139\n00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.080\nmix and match this a little bit,\ncreate some interesting things.\n\n140\n00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.640\nBecause each server is maintaining\ntheir own copy of the data base,\n\n141\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.900\nwe can customize that setting,\nits pretty neat.\n\n142\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.640\nNow, I'm not gonna do a lag time on mine.\n\n143\n00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.630\nI want mine to be real time if one fails,\nI'll jump to the other.\n\n144\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.150\nIf I get blown out with a virus here,\nI'll go to my back up tapes and\n\n145\n00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.810\nrestore from there.\n\n146\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.590\nI'll sort it out.\n\n147\n00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.220\nAnd we'll see in the restore episodes\nwhere you can actually start to play\n\n148\n00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.840\nforward your transaction logs and stop\nat a certain point in time if you want.\n\n149\n00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.140\nSo you can get that same effect even\nwithout doing a lag copy of your database.\n\n150\n00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.800\nAll right, so\nI'm going to go ahead and save that.\n\n151\n00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.889\nAnd what it's gonna do, it's gonna start\na sync operation in the background and\n\n152\n00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:01.078\nthat's gonna start running.\n\n153\n00:08:01.078 --> 00:08:04.846\nBut while it's doing its thing I\nwanna show you guys real quick how\n\n154\n00:08:04.846 --> 00:08:06.090\nthe lag copies work.\n\n155\n00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.653\nIf I browse to my database, so\n\n156\n00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:11.290\nI'm just gonna browse on the hard\ndrive where my database is stored.\n\n157\n00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.780\nEach database has a main database file,\nsomething.edb.\n\n158\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.940\nSo if I go into Sales,\nI'll find sales.edb right here,\n\n159\n00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.580\nbut as we write data to the databases,\nwe start to make changes.\n\n160\n00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.740\nThe changes are all being written\nto these transaction logs,\n\n161\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.990\nthese guys right here, this\nE0100000000001, all the way through 9, and\n\n162\n00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.070\nthat's gonna keep going up, so\nI probably have some more up here.\n\n163\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.790\nYeah.\n\n164\n00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.010\nNo, those are my reserves.\n\n165\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.010\nEventually, we'll get more,\nand it'll start to climb up.\n\n166\n00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.080\nBut those are where the changes are going.\n\n167\n00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.930\nSo once the initial database\nreplication is done,\n\n168\n00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.040\nthis is what it's copying\nbetween the servers.\n\n169\n00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.970\nSo when new email comes\nin on the first server,\n\n170\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.460\nit then just takes that transaction log,\nsends it to the other server.\n\n171\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.510\nAnd now the other server\nhas those transactions,\n\n172\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.740\nit writes it to its own database,\nand now it's up to date.\n\n173\n00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.430\nAnd that's an ongoing thing that's\ngonna keep happening in the background\n\n174\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.580\nas our system runs.\n\n175\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.590\nSo that's what it's setting up.\n\n176\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.577\nBut the initial database copy, this,\nit's doing a volume shadow copy of\n\n177\n00:09:07.577 --> 00:09:10.470\nthe database,\nthen cloning it to the other side and so\n\n178\n00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.131\nthis is the file that's\ngonna take the longest.\n\n179\n00:09:13.131 --> 00:09:14.790\nMine's only 250 megs.\n\n180\n00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.180\nNot gonna take long at all.\n\n181\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.730\nBut if yours is a terabyte,\nit might take a day, who knows,\n\n182\n00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.170\ndepending on how slow your network\nis to copy to the other side.\n\n183\n00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.374\nThen the transaction log files copy and\nit rolls them forward.\n\n184\n00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:29.770\nAll right, it looks like it's\ncompleted my operation there.\n\n185\n00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.255\nI'm gonna go ahead and close that.\n\n186\n00:09:31.255 --> 00:09:33.538\nAnd now when I take\na look at my databases,\n\n187\n00:09:33.538 --> 00:09:37.326\nsee how the sales database shows up and\nit says servers with copies and\n\n188\n00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:39.890\nnow there's more than\none server in the list.\n\n189\n00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.140\nIt's kinda hard to see because of\nthe way these columns are lined up.\n\n190\n00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.340\nBut if we expand this out,\nyou can see them.\n\n191\n00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.130\nOr you can see them over\nhere in my details pane\n\n192\n00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.070\nthat it's got two servers in place.\n\n193\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.220\nNow when we start to look at these guys,\nmost of our databases,\n\n194\n00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.890\nwe've only got one copy of.\n\n195\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:01.320\nBut this one I can see LAB-EXCHSERV01,\nLAB-EXCHSERV02 right there.\n\n196\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.370\nSo the two servers have the copies and\n\n197\n00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.230\nI can see down here that it is active and\nmounted.\n\n198\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.090\nAnd this is the one we really\nwant to pay attention to.\n\n199\n00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.550\nThis right here, copy queue length.\n\n200\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.560\nThe copy queue, those are changes that are\nwaiting to be applied on the other server.\n\n201\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.460\nAll right, if you see a big number there\nin your copy queue, that's a problem.\n\n202\n00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.770\nThat means the other side is\nnot up to date, all right?\n\n203\n00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.960\nYou should always see zero or\na really low number, one, five, ten,\n\n204\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.990\nsomething like that right?\n\n205\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.490\nWhen your server gets really busy,\nthere's always gonna be a queue, but\n\n206\n00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.280\nit shouldn't be very large, right?\n\n207\n00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.380\nIn my case, it's a zero.\n\n208\n00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.855\nThat's exactly what we want.\n\n209\n00:10:34.855 --> 00:10:38.735\nContent index state is healthy,\nwe're good, right?\n\n210\n00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:42.198\nAnd this is LAB-EXCHSERV01,\nif I keep scrolling down,\n\n211\n00:10:42.198 --> 00:10:44.839\nI'll see LAB-EXCHSERV02, same thing.\n\n212\n00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:49.393\nAnd on this one, the copy queue length,\nof zero, it's the passive server and\n\n213\n00:10:49.393 --> 00:10:53.684\nit's currently healthy, and\nI've got a content index state of failed.\n\n214\n00:10:53.684 --> 00:10:54.745\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n215\n00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:58.510\nWell, it just got this database,\nand so in the background,\n\n216\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.100\nthe index service is\nhaving to run to index it.\n\n217\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.620\nWe've got an index here on our server,\nit's building its own over there.\n\n218\n00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.620\nAnd you might ask yourself,\nwhy not just copy the index over?\n\n219\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.250\nAnd the index, it actually has pointers\nthat reference where data is stored on\n\n220\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.980\nthe hard drive, and so\nit's different for every server.\n\n221\n00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.110\nWe can't just copy the index, so\nit has to rebuilt on the other side.\n\n222\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.340\nI expect it to be failed for\nawhile, right.\n\n223\n00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.180\nThe larger your database is, the longer\nit'll take to rebuild that index.\n\n224\n00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.030\nAnd I'm not worried about that\nbecause it's passive right now.\n\n225\n00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.510\nRight, it's not the active server,\nso nobody is using that index.\n\n226\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.600\nI've got time.\n\n227\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.340\nAnd then once the index is rebuilt,\nevery time it applies transaction logs,\n\n228\n00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.250\nit's going to be updating that index.\n\n229\n00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.470\nAnd so it'll stay nice and healthy, and\n\n230\n00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.730\nwe've got a good database\ncopy right there.\n\n231\n00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.673\nAll right, now notice when we look\nat EXCHSERV01 that it shows it's up,\n\n232\n00:11:45.673 --> 00:11:49.920\nthat it's active,\nthat it's mounted, and that's it.\n\n233\n00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.510\nBut on EXCHSERV02,\nI have a few extra options, right?\n\n234\n00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.650\nIf we look down here,\nlet's see I can make that bigger or,\n\n235\n00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.800\noop, I'm making it smaller.\n\n236\n00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.695\nThat's exactly what I didn't want to do.\n\n237\n00:11:59.695 --> 00:12:04.250\n[LAUGH] I was attempting to make it\na little bit larger so we could see.\n\n238\n00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.129\nWell now that's going to be an all\nnew record for largeness, so\n\n239\n00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:12.741\nyou can see down there that we\ngot a couple of extra options,\n\n240\n00:12:12.741 --> 00:12:16.440\nif I can stop messing with my zoom,\nthere we go.\n\n241\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:21.410\nYou can suspend, activate, or\nremove that other node, okay?\n\n242\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.790\nNobody's using that other node right now\nbecause I just brought it up, right?\n\n243\n00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.124\nAnd we're not under failure, so\n\n244\n00:12:26.124 --> 00:12:29.390\nI could remove it if I decided I didn't\nwant that part of the DAG anymore.\n\n245\n00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.020\nAll right?\n\n246\n00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.760\nI could also activate it,\nthat's how we test failover, right?\n\n247\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.780\nHow do I know that other\nserver is working?\n\n248\n00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.310\nWell, I could put somebody's mailbox\nright here in Sales and access it.\n\n249\n00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.510\nAnd then, I can come over here and\n\n250\n00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.400\nactivate, the other server will go active,\nand that person will flip right over.\n\n251\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.750\nNow your end users,\nthey don't even notice that happen, right?\n\n252\n00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.180\nMicrosoft Outlook, Outlook Web Access,\nthey all just automatically jump to\n\n253\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.340\nthe other server, cuz they're not actually\ntalking to the other server, are they?\n\n254\n00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.100\nThey're talking to a client access server.\n\n255\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.980\nAnd the client access server is then\ntalking to the mailbox server for them.\n\n256\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.170\nSo when we fail this over, it's the client\naccess server that says all right,\n\n257\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.620\nlet me jump over to the other system.\n\n258\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.910\nSo even if we've got a POP3 or\nan IMAP4 client, they failover, and\n\n259\n00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.000\nit's seamless to them.\n\n260\n00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.950\nThey don't even see it happen.\n\n261\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.990\nThat's the best part about the DAG.\n\n262\n00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.810\nI didn't need shared storage and\ncrazy cluster hardware.\n\n263\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.280\nI can just have two servers,\nseamless failover.\n\n264\n00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.790\nIt really does work well.\n\n265\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.960\nAnd this is if I manually wanna test it.\n\n266\n00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.980\nI can hit Activate and\nit will manually flip over.\n\n267\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.290\nIt'll do that automatically too.\n\n268\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.001\nIf I were to cut the power to EXCHSERV01,\n\n269\n00:13:29.001 --> 00:13:33.340\nEXCHSERV02 will say hm,\nI think server one is dead.\n\n270\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.680\nLet me check the file share witness,\nis it dead on the file share witness too?\n\n271\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.820\nOh, it's dead there too.\n\n272\n00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.840\nAll right, I need to go ahead and\ngo active.\n\n273\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.890\nAnd it'll go active, and your users\nwill connect, and off you go, right?\n\n274\n00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.790\nSo that's gonna be\nhappening automatically.\n\n275\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.015\nYou can also suspend the server.\n\n276\n00:13:47.015 --> 00:13:48.725\nThat just means, hey, let's take a break.\n\n277\n00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:52.125\nLet's pause that server and\nstop updating it.\n\n278\n00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:54.895\nIt still has the database, it still has\nthe indexes, it still has all that, but\n\n279\n00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:56.945\nwe're gonna stop sending\ntransaction logs to it.\n\n280\n00:13:56.945 --> 00:13:59.955\nNow, there's not a whole lot\nof reason why we'd do that.\n\n281\n00:13:59.955 --> 00:14:01.545\nI can think of a couple examples.\n\n282\n00:14:01.545 --> 00:14:03.795\nMaybe I'm about to do some\nmaintenance on that server, and so\n\n283\n00:14:03.795 --> 00:14:06.085\nI know I'm gonna do some reboots and\nother things, so\n\n284\n00:14:06.085 --> 00:14:09.230\nI might wanna suspend replication,\nso that I don't get a bunch of\n\n285\n00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.300\nerrors in my event log because\nExchange is trying to replicate to it.\n\n286\n00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.710\nThat's one example.\n\n287\n00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.026\nAnother example might be, I'm about to\ndo an upgrade on Exchange server 01, and\n\n288\n00:14:18.026 --> 00:14:19.877\njust in case something goes wrong,\n\n289\n00:14:19.877 --> 00:14:22.854\nI want to have Exchange server\n02 kinda frozen in time.\n\n290\n00:14:22.854 --> 00:14:26.285\nSo I could suspend it and start to\ndo my work on Exchange server 01 and\n\n291\n00:14:26.285 --> 00:14:30.011\nif things go south, if things just\nbreak I can just say forget server 01,\n\n292\n00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:31.690\nlet's flip over to server 02.\n\n293\n00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.940\nAnd you can flip over to that one and\nnow you're in business.\n\n294\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.800\nSo, that would be an example of when\nwe might choose to suspend that.\n\n295\n00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.000\nBut if I want to activate it,\nI just can just hit Activate and\n\n296\n00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.460\nit's gonna tell it to\nbring that server active.\n\n297\n00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.506\nRight now, if somebody wants\nto connect to that sales DB,\n\n298\n00:14:45.506 --> 00:14:47.819\nthey're gonna go to Exchange server 01.\n\n299\n00:14:47.819 --> 00:14:50.670\nWhen I choose the other one to be active,\nthey'll go to server 02.\n\n300\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.860\nNow remember,\nthey don't see server 01 and server 02.\n\n301\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.610\nThey see Lab-Mailbox.\n\n302\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.713\nRemember when I created the DAG,\nI named it Lab-Mailbox and\n\n303\n00:15:00.713 --> 00:15:05.070\nI gave it a virtual IP\naddress of 192.168.0.222.\n\n304\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.010\nSo they see a server called Lab-Mailbox.\n\n305\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.880\nThey don't see the stuff behind it.\n\n306\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.585\nThey don't realize they're being sent\nto one physical server or another.\n\n307\n00:15:12.585 --> 00:15:15.988\nThat's part of what makes this all so\nseamless and easy.\n\n308\n00:15:15.988 --> 00:15:18.090\nSo I'm gonna take that sales database and\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n309\n00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.312\nactivate the other node, and\nwe'll go ahead and tell it to activate.\n\n310\n00:15:21.312 --> 00:15:24.410\nIt's gonna reach out and it's gonna\ntell that other system to go active.\n\n311\n00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.080\nNow, I've got a little error here.\n\n312\n00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:26.780\nLet's see what we've got.\n\n313\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.016\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\ntake that second node and\n\n314\n00:15:29.016 --> 00:15:29.920\nI'm gonna activate it.\n\n315\n00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.229\nNow when I activate it, it's gonna tell\nit to bring that other node active and\n\n316\n00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:36.627\nstart sending people over to server 02.\n\n317\n00:15:36.627 --> 00:15:39.870\nNow, well, I got an error, so\nthat didn't work out so well.\n\n318\n00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.370\nWell, if we take a look at the error,\nlet's see what's going on.\n\n319\n00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.740\nSo if we kinda break this down, we see\nDatabase copy Sales on Exchange Server 02\n\n320\n00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:51.010\nhas content index catalog files\nin the following state, Failed.\n\n321\n00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.550\nMy index isn't active, all right?\n\n322\n00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:57.050\nI can't fail over to that other node yet,\nbecause it's not fully active.\n\n323\n00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.420\nI've gotta wait for\nit to finish building its index.\n\n324\n00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.465\nWhen the index state goes to healthy Then\nwe'll be able to fail over to that node,\n\n325\n00:16:03.465 --> 00:16:06.690\nand that's not uncommon for\na new cluster that we just built up.\n\n326\n00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.660\nIt takes time for it to build that index,\nand so I can't fail over to it just yet.\n\n327\n00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.380\nNow, we can monitor that replication\nstatus a few different ways.\n\n328\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.060\nRight here in the GUI, we don't\nreally get a whole lot of feedback,\n\n329\n00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.400\nas far as how far it's replicated.\n\n330\n00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.236\nIf you choose a node and hit View Details,\n\n331\n00:16:22.236 --> 00:16:24.923\nit will actually break down some\nof the information for you.\n\n332\n00:16:24.923 --> 00:16:29.139\nAnd you can see, right here where I'm\nseeing that Content index status Failed,\n\n333\n00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:30.202\nstatus is Healthy.\n\n334\n00:16:30.202 --> 00:16:32.461\nAnd I can see my Copy queue length.\n\n335\n00:16:32.461 --> 00:16:34.880\nYou can start to see\nsome of that information.\n\n336\n00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.038\nThere's a Replay queue length, let me\nexplain the difference between those.\n\n337\n00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:41.710\nThe Copy queue length is just me copying\nthe changes to the other server.\n\n338\n00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.190\nThe Replay queue length is once\nthe server receives those changes,\n\n339\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.680\nit has to apply them.\n\n340\n00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.870\nSo ideally, I see a zero on both of these.\n\n341\n00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.443\nI've copied everything\nto the other server, and\n\n342\n00:16:50.443 --> 00:16:51.651\nthe server's already applied them.\n\n343\n00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:56.070\nBut if I see one has a really high number,\nthen there's some kind of problem.\n\n344\n00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.602\nI might need to address that, right.\n\n345\n00:16:57.602 --> 00:17:01.070\nNow the other thing I can watch out for\nis this field right here, Error messages.\n\n346\n00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.735\nIf there was actually a true\nproblem here for me to deal with,\n\n347\n00:17:03.735 --> 00:17:05.001\nI'd have an error message.\n\n348\n00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:07.800\nAnd I'd be able to look at that and\ntry to find out what the problem is.\n\n349\n00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.070\nMine's empty, and that's because\nI don't have a real problem.\n\n350\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:14.117\nIt tells me my index failed, but it's\nactually building that in the background,\n\n351\n00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:14.966\nso I just need to wait.\n\n352\n00:17:14.966 --> 00:17:16.206\nBut you can see other information.\n\n353\n00:17:16.206 --> 00:17:19.799\nHere's where you can manipulate that\npreference number and lag time, too,\n\n354\n00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:23.520\nif you wanna change that after the fact,\nyou can go in and kinda work with those.\n\n355\n00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.280\nSo we should be good there.\n\n356\n00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.281\nYou can also monitor a lot\nof this from the PowerShell.\n\n357\n00:17:26.281 --> 00:17:29.931\nRight, so if I were to fire up\nmy PowerShell on this system,\n\n358\n00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:32.780\nlet me get into my\nExchange Management Shell.\n\n359\n00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.651\nWe got a few different commands\nthat we can throw at it here.\n\n360\n00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:39.711\nI'm just gonna bump up my font size so\nyou guys would be able to see this\n\n361\n00:17:43.711 --> 00:17:47.980\nAll right, and some of the commands\nthat we can run to see what's going on.\n\n362\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.050\nWe've got, for example,\nGet-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup.\n\n363\n00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.541\nThat'll show us information about\nour database availability group.\n\n364\n00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:58.148\nAnd then we can do\nGet-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus, and so\n\n365\n00:17:58.148 --> 00:18:01.410\nthat will show us information\nabout where our copy is.\n\n366\n00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.384\nSo, I'm gonna do\na Get-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup,\n\n367\n00:18:06.384 --> 00:18:10.641\nand that's just gonna list\nthe DAGs that I have.\n\n368\n00:18:10.641 --> 00:18:18.020\nAnd then I can specify a particular one,\nI can say Identity LAB-MAILBOX.\n\n369\n00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.890\nAnd that'll give me the details\non that particular system,\n\n370\n00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.980\nwhich is really not different\nthan what it gave me there.\n\n371\n00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.080\nBut I'm gonna add one more command\nto that, which is -Status.\n\n372\n00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.770\nAnd that's what's gonna let me see what\nthe current health of that information is,\n\n373\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.470\nand the way it lists it here\nis not terribly informative.\n\n374\n00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.248\nI need to throw that into a format list so\n\n375\n00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:39.470\nthat I can actually see\nthe true status information.\n\n376\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.872\nAnd now you can look in here and\n\n377\n00:18:40.872 --> 00:18:43.691\nkinda see where things are at\nas far as its communications.\n\n378\n00:18:43.691 --> 00:18:47.156\nSo, this is one way that we can view\nsettings, a little easier through the GUI,\n\n379\n00:18:47.156 --> 00:18:48.870\nbut you can view it here too.\n\n380\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.820\nSo, you can see things\nlike the ReplicationPort.\n\n381\n00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.290\nIf you find that replication is failing,\nyou can have Windows Firewall blocking it,\n\n382\n00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.600\nand so that would be something\nthat we would need to open.\n\n383\n00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.520\nBut otherwise you can see some\nbasic information in here.\n\n384\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:07.300\nAnd then there's\nthe Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus.\n\n385\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.830\nAnd for this one,\nyou can specify a particular mailbox.\n\n386\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.770\nSo I wanna look at that\nsales mailbox database, and\n\n387\n00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.790\ngive me information about\nits current status.\n\n388\n00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:15.771\nAnd so it's gonna give me that list.\n\n389\n00:19:15.771 --> 00:19:17.891\nAnd you'll see how it's\nMounted on EXCHSERV01.\n\n390\n00:19:17.891 --> 00:19:19.871\nIt's Healthy on SERV02.\n\n391\n00:19:19.871 --> 00:19:24.790\nThere's my queue length that are showing\nup, and we can also see our index status.\n\n392\n00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.200\nAnd actually looking here,\n\n393\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.240\nit looks like my index state just\nwent Healthy on the other system.\n\n394\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.500\nIf you wait long enough,\nthen things do happen.\n\n395\n00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.218\nThere's more information in\nthere if you do a format list.\n\n396\n00:19:34.218 --> 00:19:37.420\nYou'll see there's actually quite a bit\ntucked away inside of this one as\n\n397\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.670\nfar as status.\n\n398\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.691\nBut that initial output had\nexactly what I needed to see.\n\n399\n00:19:41.691 --> 00:19:45.139\nI'm gonna go back here to my GUI, and\nI'm just gonna refresh this screen,\n\n400\n00:19:45.139 --> 00:19:47.490\nmake sure I've got the latest data.\n\n401\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.960\nAnd now when I go in and\ndouble-check my system, my LAB-EXCHSERV02,\n\n402\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.792\nit's got Passive, Healthy,\nContent index status Healthy.\n\n403\n00:19:55.792 --> 00:19:57.500\nLooks like everything's healthy now.\n\n404\n00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.520\nI should be to test that fail over.\n\n405\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.900\nSo we'll go ahead and test it.\n\n406\n00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.081\nI'm gonna go come under here under\nLAB-EXCHSERV02, and I'm gonna activate it.\n\n407\n00:20:05.081 --> 00:20:06.661\nAnd we'll see what happens.\n\n408\n00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:10.020\nAll right, so there it goes.\n\n409\n00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.904\nIt's reaching out to the server node.\n\n410\n00:20:10.904 --> 00:20:13.830\nThe server's already got the database,\nso it doesn't have to copy anything.\n\n411\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:18.060\nIt just has to say, take the main\ndatabase off, bring the other one active,\n\n412\n00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.580\nclients will automatically jump over\nto the other system when it's done.\n\n413\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.710\nThere we go,\nyou've completed the operation.\n\n414\n00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.210\nWhen I hit close,\nI still see my Sales database is up.\n\n415\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.320\nNow look at my data over here.\n\n416\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.534\nI can see that EXCHSERV01 is now Passive,\nHealthy, and\n\n417\n00:20:32.534 --> 00:20:37.430\nEXCHSERV02 is Active, Mounted,\nand look at the index.\n\n418\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.680\nThe index state is Failed\non both of them right now.\n\n419\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.660\nThey're re-correcting their index.\n\n420\n00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.180\nNow people are in there,\npeople are working with their email.\n\n421\n00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.729\nBut if they start doing\nsearches of the mailbox,\n\n422\n00:20:47.729 --> 00:20:51.161\nthe reason it says failed here is\nthe index is probably outdated.\n\n423\n00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:53.661\nWe're kind of replaying transaction\nlogs in the background.\n\n424\n00:20:53.661 --> 00:20:57.270\nSo the search will still work, but their\nlatest and greatest emails that have come\n\n425\n00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.001\nin, anything that was in the queue during\nthe fail over, hasn't been indexed yet.\n\n426\n00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:03.242\nAnd it usually doesn't take very long.\n\n427\n00:21:03.242 --> 00:21:06.410\nYou'd have to have an incredibly\nbusy server for it to take a while.\n\n428\n00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.380\nSo I'm just gonna refresh, and\n\n429\n00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.960\nsure enough, I can see my index state\nis now Healthy on both of them.\n\n430\n00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.060\nSo I'm healthy, I'm up, and\nthe second server is now the active node.\n\n431\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.311\nOkay, now the second server\nhad a preference of two.\n\n432\n00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:19.520\nThe first server had a preference of one.\n\n433\n00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.110\nThe first server is healthy,\naren't we gonna fail back?\n\n434\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.705\nWell, no,\nbecause we made manually failed over\n\n435\n00:21:26.705 --> 00:21:31.545\nit's not gonna do another fail over unless\nan actual problem occurs, all right.\n\n436\n00:21:31.545 --> 00:21:34.875\nYou have in the cluster world,\nyou have what's call preemptive fail over.\n\n437\n00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:38.398\nPreemptive fail over is when you fail\nover even though there's not a problem.\n\n438\n00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:39.802\nSo whoever's preference one,\n\n439\n00:21:39.802 --> 00:21:42.610\nthey're gonna take over even\nif there's not problem, right?\n\n440\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.210\nThat's preemptive fail over.\n\n441\n00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.850\nExchange database availability\ngroups are non-preemptive.\n\n442\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.520\nIn other words,\nthey only fail over if there's a problem.\n\n443\n00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.160\nSo if I leave it like this,\nEXCHSERV02 has a preference of two.\n\n444\n00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.072\nEXCHSERV01 has a preference of one.\n\n445\n00:21:57.072 --> 00:22:01.060\nBut EXCHSERV02 is gonna stay active\nforever, until a problem happens.\n\n446\n00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.426\nIf I restart EXCHSERV02, if EXCHSERV02\ngoes offline or if I manually hit\n\n447\n00:22:04.426 --> 00:22:07.811\nthe deactivate server button on SERV01,\nthat'll trigger a fail-over.\n\n448\n00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:09.350\nAnd It'll go back to SERV01.\n\n449\n00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:13.044\nBut if I don't do anything,\nthen SERV02 is gonna stay active,\n\n450\n00:22:13.044 --> 00:22:15.630\nand that's gonna be the end of that,\nright.\n\n451\n00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:21.120\nSo, for example, I could, let's say I\nwanted to do a, just a simulation here.\n\n452\n00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.461\nWe could take SERV02 and\nshut it down, right.\n\n453\n00:22:23.461 --> 00:22:30.761\nSo I could do something like this.\n\n454\n00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:35.130\nI'm gonna basically force\nEXCHSERV02 to shut down.\n\n455\n00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:42.540\nAnd when it shuts down, it's gonna go\noffline, and SERV01 is gonna look at that.\n\n456\n00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.200\nAnd it's gonna say,\nwow, is SERV02 offline?\n\n457\n00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.330\nI think it's offline.\n\n458\n00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.611\nLet me go check with the file witness and\nsee if they agree.\n\n459\n00:22:48.611 --> 00:22:50.244\nAnd it'll look at the file witness,\n\n460\n00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:53.940\nand it'll see that SERV02 is not writing\nfiles into that witness share anymore.\n\n461\n00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.000\nAnd when it's not writing files there,\nthat means the witness thinks it's down.\n\n462\n00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.770\nWe think it's down,\nwe need to go active, okay?\n\n463\n00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:00.990\nAnd that usually happens pretty quick.\n\n464\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.911\nSo I can see I can't ping SERV02 anymore.\n\n465\n00:23:03.911 --> 00:23:05.681\nSo SERV02 is offline.\n\n466\n00:23:05.681 --> 00:23:09.605\nAnd if I come in here and refresh this,\nI can watch the Sales database, and\n\n467\n00:23:09.605 --> 00:23:10.820\nit does take a moment.\n\n468\n00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.283\nBecause it always assumes that, yeah,\nmaybe we're just dropping some packets,\n\n469\n00:23:14.283 --> 00:23:16.260\nlet's give it a moment and make sure.\n\n470\n00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.320\nBut when I come in here and refresh,\nsee how it's taking a while to load there?\n\n471\n00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.577\nIt's trying to figure out what's going on.\n\n472\n00:23:20.577 --> 00:23:22.043\nAnd on the side here,\n\n473\n00:23:22.043 --> 00:23:27.150\nI can see that LAB-EXCHSERV01\none is still Passive, Healthy.\n\n474\n00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.780\nAnd SERV02 is Passive, ServiceDown.\n\n475\n00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.270\nWe see that SERV02 is down, what do I do?\n\n476\n00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.840\nWell, it's making sure that it's really\ndown, that this isn't just a quick blip.\n\n477\n00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.690\nAnd so in the next couple of seconds,\nit's gonna recognize that this isn't\n\n478\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.040\njust a quick blip, and\nit's gonna go ahead and bring us active.\n\n479\n00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.560\nAnd so we can give that a moment.\n\n480\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.216\nIf it doesn't happen in a reasonable time,\nyou could force it, but\n\n481\n00:23:49.216 --> 00:23:50.252\nit will happen on its own.\n\n482\n00:23:50.252 --> 00:23:51.638\nThat's kind of the whole point of\nthis is that we shouldn't have to\n\n483\n00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:52.175\nworry about it, right?\n\n484\n00:23:52.175 --> 00:23:55.855\nYou set it and forget it, and\nit will take things over as needed.\n\n485\n00:23:55.855 --> 00:24:00.780\nSo, looking at my Sales database here,\nit still says Active on SERV02,\n\n486\n00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.075\nbut it's status over here\nis flagged as Unknown.\n\n487\n00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:07.761\nAnd looking at the health information\nover here, I can see that it is\n\n488\n00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:12.435\nPassive Disconnected and Healthy for\nSERV01, Passive ServiceDown on SERV02.\n\n489\n00:24:12.435 --> 00:24:15.998\nSo we can just keep refreshing, and\neventually it'll recognize that and\n\n490\n00:24:15.998 --> 00:24:17.370\nflip it over.\n\n491\n00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.330\nIf I remember right,\nit's a minute and a half is how long,\n\n492\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.190\nit's like three 30-second intervals.\n\n493\n00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.960\nSo we'll just give it a second while\nit kinda sorts through that and\n\n494\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.370\neventually goes active.\n\n495\n00:24:27.434 --> 00:24:30.460\nAll right, if you're in a giant hurry,\nyou could always come in here and\n\n496\n00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.220\ntake SERV01 and hit Activate, and\nthat'll bring it active right now.\n\n497\n00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.860\nIn my case, it is taking a while\nto actually do that flip over.\n\n498\n00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.721\nWe're at risk of me becoming bored.\n\n499\n00:24:40.721 --> 00:24:43.581\nThat's always bad, and then I start\ndoing things and break the server.\n\n500\n00:24:43.581 --> 00:24:45.101\nSo, but we'll give it just a second here.\n\n501\n00:24:45.101 --> 00:24:46.746\nIf it doesn't become active,\nI'll hit the Active button, and\n\n502\n00:24:46.746 --> 00:24:47.850\nthat'll take care of it.\n\n503\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:48.831\nBut it is automatic.\n\n504\n00:24:48.831 --> 00:24:51.672\nIt does kick that over, and\nthen it brings the server back up.\n\n505\n00:24:51.672 --> 00:24:53.391\nHopefully your end users don't know it.\n\n506\n00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:58.271\nReally Outlook and Exchange,\nthey try and run in a cache mode anyway.\n\n507\n00:24:58.271 --> 00:25:00.280\nSo Outlook downloads their mailbox.\n\n508\n00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:05.080\nA lot of users what they'll notice,\nis they'll go to send an email, and\n\n509\n00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.380\nthe email will sit there in their\noutbox instead of going to sent items.\n\n510\n00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.970\nIt'll just sit there kind of waiting,\nand that's it, right?\n\n511\n00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.830\nIt's just kinda sitting and waiting for\nthose emails to move across.\n\n512\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.420\nAnd then when the new server comes up,\nthe emails flow.\n\n513\n00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:23.060\nSo the end user, all they see is\njust the email in the outbox, right?\n\n514\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.740\nBut then once the server is up,\nit flows normal, and you're in business.\n\n515\n00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.990\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nforce it to flip over, so here it is.\n\n516\n00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.940\nNow it's gonna have to flush some\nof the transaction logs out because\n\n517\n00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.068\nof the unclean shut down on the other\nsystem, but that shouldn't be a big deal.\n\n518\n00:25:34.068 --> 00:25:36.790\nThe new node will come active, and\nour users will be back in business.\n\n519\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.510\nSo, database availability groups, there's\na couple of hoops we had to jump through\n\n520\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.470\nto get them set up in the beginning.\n\n521\n00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:44.460\nBut once they're in place,\nthey're really easy to administer,\n\n522\n00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.630\nand that's pretty much the end of it.\n\n523\n00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:51.400\nSo in this episode we got a chance to\nsee database availability groups in\n\n524\n00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.010\naction, right?\n\n525\n00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.540\nWe created them in the last episode, but\n\n526\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.670\nin this episode we moved\na database into the DAG.\n\n527\n00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.210\nThen we got see failing it over to\nanother node and failing it back again,\n\n528\n00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.970\nas well as how to monitor\nit via PowerShell.\n\n529\n00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.581\nSo couple of different things\nthere that are all pretty useful.\n\n530\n00:26:04.581 --> 00:26:07.936\nIt's a great system, and it really does\ntake a lot of burden off of system\n\n531\n00:26:07.936 --> 00:26:11.980\nadministrators too if we're not having\nto set up true hardware based clusters.\n\n532\n00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.652\nHere it's just done right inside of\nour systems, really works excellent.\n\n533\n00:26:14.652 --> 00:26:17.141\nAll right, well that's a great spot for\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n534\n00:26:17.141 --> 00:26:19.461\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n535\n00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:22.661\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet,\nand I'll see you next time.\n\n536\n00:26:22.661 --> 00:26:28.920\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.740\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.270\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.950\nback again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.380\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at backing up and\n\n7\n00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.610\nrestoring Microsoft Exchange.\n\n8\n00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.870\nNow, I know in all the episodes I\nstart off when I say things like, man,\n\n9\n00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.000\nthis is a really great feature.\n\n10\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.330\nWe're gonna talk about something exciting.\n\n11\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.216\nBut today we're going to be talking about\nsomething that's just really really\n\n12\n00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:35.857\nimportant.\n\n13\n00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:40.015\nAs an Exchange administrator, having\na reliable backup of your system and\n\n14\n00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:42.857\nknowing how to restore it\nis extremely essential.\n\n15\n00:00:42.857 --> 00:00:44.099\nBecause when a failure happens,\n\n16\n00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:46.370\nyou don't wanna be scrambling\ntrying to figure things out.\n\n17\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.303\nYou wanna know exactly what to do and\n\n18\n00:00:48.303 --> 00:00:51.082\nget that database back\nonline as fast as possible.\n\n19\n00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:55.177\nSo, this episode is actually gonna be\none of a series of episodes cuz there's\n\n20\n00:00:55.177 --> 00:00:58.337\nseveral different ways to\nbackup Exchange and to restore.\n\n21\n00:00:58.337 --> 00:01:00.258\nReally there's only a few\nways to back it up but\n\n22\n00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:03.730\nthere's several ways to restore it based\non what it is that we're trying achieve.\n\n23\n00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.270\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntackling restoring the entire mailbox\n\n24\n00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.865\nexchange or exchange mailbox database\nin the event that we have a hard drive\n\n25\n00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.620\nfailure, server failures or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n26\n00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.638\nIf you haven't watched it already,\n\n27\n00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:18.902\nwe did an episode on database\navailability groups or DAGs.\n\n28\n00:01:18.902 --> 00:01:23.854\nAnd with those, we can stop a failure from\nbeing visible to the end user at all,\n\n29\n00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:24.600\nright?\n\n30\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.540\nAnd that's pretty cool.\n\n31\n00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.510\nWhen one server fails,\nanother server already takes over.\n\n32\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.150\nBut we don't all have resources available\nto do database availability groups.\n\n33\n00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.550\nSo for the next couple episodes,\n\n34\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.790\nI want to focus on technologies we can use\nto back-up and restore individual servers.\n\n35\n00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.550\nIf they're not in a DAG, all right.\n\n36\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.910\nSo we're just gonna start off\nwith a plain old run of the mill\n\n37\n00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.370\nhow to I back up my mailbox database\nrestore or my mailbox database so\n\n38\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.310\nthat I can restore it in\nthe event of a failure, all right.\n\n39\n00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.670\nNow when it comes to\nplanning your backups and\n\n40\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.460\nrecovery, there's a few things\nwe need to think about and\n\n41\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.040\nthe two big ones that you hear about\nare the RPO and RTO, all right.\n\n42\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.680\nRecovery time objective and\nrecovery point objective.\n\n43\n00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.380\nThe recovery time objective is,\nhow long can you be down for.\n\n44\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.890\nIf I have a failure, and\nmy server goes off-line, how much\n\n45\n00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.890\ntime do I have before I can restore\nwithout my users feeling pain right?\n\n46\n00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.830\nBefore my company losing money?\n\n47\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.910\nIf I lose access to my mailbox for\nan hour, that's not a big deal to me,\n\n48\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.860\nI'm okay with that.\n\n49\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.540\nIt's just an hour.\n\n50\n00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.060\nI'll check my email later.\n\n51\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.300\nBut if I'm without email for\nthree days, that's a problem for me.\n\n52\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.110\nI can't go days without email,\nright, well that's me.\n\n53\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.837\nIn your environment,\nemail might be mission critical.\n\n54\n00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:38.690\nYou might not be able to go\nan hour without email, right?\n\n55\n00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.810\nThat could be a big deal for you.\n\n56\n00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.680\nSo, different companies\nhave different needs and\n\n57\n00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.250\nyou'll need to structure\nyour backup around that.\n\n58\n00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.980\nSome solutions just will not work in\nthe amount of time that you have, and\n\n59\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.720\nthat's where database\navailability groups are so\n\n60\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.760\nnice because they do instantaneous\nrecovery and that really works out well.\n\n61\n00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.512\nThe other part was recovery\npoint objective, RPO.\n\n62\n00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:02.110\nAnd what RPO is stating is basically\nhow much data can I afford to lose?\n\n63\n00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.290\nLet's say I do a backup\nevery night at midnight, but\n\n64\n00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.400\nthen I have a failure at 6 AM.\n\n65\n00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.000\nWell, if I go and\nrestore my backup from midnight,\n\n66\n00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.140\nwhat happened to all my\nemail from midnight to 6 AM?\n\n67\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.140\nIt's gone.\nI lost it.\n\n68\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.110\nAll right.\n\n69\n00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.110\nI lost six hours of email.\n\n70\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.480\nIs that a big deal?\n\n71\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.940\nIn your company that\nmight not be a big deal.\n\n72\n00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.240\nYou might just say whatever,\nit's six hour, who cares?\n\n73\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.680\nRight, at least I got\neverything else back.\n\n74\n00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.660\nAnd that may be fine.\n\n75\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.810\nBut you might have a mission critical\nenvironment where you can't afford to lose\n\n76\n00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.970\neven one single email and\n\n77\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.120\nin that environment using just a nightly\nbackup is not gonna do, right?\n\n78\n00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.604\nYour recovery point\nobjective is much shorter.\n\n79\n00:03:37.604 --> 00:03:39.518\nYou don't wanna lose any e-mail, and\n\n80\n00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:42.600\ndatabase availability groups\nare that solution, all right.\n\n81\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.350\nSo DAGs, that's really the number one\nway to go to protect your server.\n\n82\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.030\nYou have a mailbox database\nstored in more than one place.\n\n83\n00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.150\nYou have a database copies, right,\nand that gives you that insulation.\n\n84\n00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.120\nBut one thing that DAGs don't give\nus is long term retention, right?\n\n85\n00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.370\nWhat if a mailbox was\ndeleted three months ago?\n\n86\n00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.540\nWell, if I delete a mailbox and\n\n87\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.010\nit actually gets removed it gets removed\nfrom the copies also, from the DAG copies.\n\n88\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.780\nSo, DAGs are not a replacement for\nbackups, they're a supplement.\n\n89\n00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.408\nDAGs are designed to shrink your RPO and\nRTO to get you online as fast as you can.\n\n90\n00:04:17.408 --> 00:04:22.212\nBut for long term data recovery,\nwe need traditional backups, all right.\n\n91\n00:04:22.212 --> 00:04:25.166\nSo you're normally gonna combine\nthese technologies together,\n\n92\n00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.650\nnot just go with one or the other.\n\n93\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.480\nYou're gonna combine them, all right.\n\n94\n00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.930\nSo watch each of these episodes.\n\n95\n00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.390\nSee each of the different ways.\n\n96\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.850\nAnd then figure out how to implement them\nin your environment to meet the needs\n\n97\n00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.190\nof your company.\n\n98\n00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.280\nBut a traditional backup you'll\nfind is actually pretty easy.\n\n99\n00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.010\nOne of the decisions we have to make\nearly on is do we want to use Microsoft's\n\n100\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.740\nsoftware or\ndo we want to use a third party, right.\n\n101\n00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.660\nThere's tons of companies out there that\nmake software that can backup Microsoft\n\n102\n00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.670\nexchange and we just need to make\na decision as to which one we want, and\n\n103\n00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.840\nthere's pros and cons to each right?\n\n104\n00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.940\nOn the Microsoft side we\nhave Windows Server Backup.\n\n105\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.990\nWindows Server Backup is built right\ninto Windows so it's free, right?\n\n106\n00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.580\nWell, that's always nice.\n\n107\n00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.940\nThe price is right.\n\n108\n00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.489\nWell, it's free because you've\nalready paid for the server so\n\n109\n00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:05.130\nit's not completely free.\n\n110\n00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.320\nBut with that you can backup\nyour database and restore it.\n\n111\n00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.540\nOn a positive side, it does backups.\n\n112\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.740\nOn a negative side,\nthere's no centralized management for it.\n\n113\n00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.210\nSo if I have 50 servers, I'm having to set\nup backups 50 times and if I'm monitoring\n\n114\n00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.820\nthose backups, I have to go to each of\nthe those 50 servers to monitor it.\n\n115\n00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.680\nSo you don't get centralized management.\n\n116\n00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.610\nBut it's cheap.\n\n117\n00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.020\nSo for small businesses,\neven for some medium businesses,\n\n118\n00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.280\nthat works out really well.\n\n119\n00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.790\nAll right,\nthe other thing is Windows Server Backup\n\n120\n00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.420\ndoesn't do a great job of\nmaintaining multiple copies.\n\n121\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.360\nSo, if you're gonna have several backups,\nspanning months or\n\n122\n00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.710\nyears even, Windows Server Backup\ngets a little clunky.\n\n123\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.150\nSo Microsoft has another product called\nthe System Center Data Protection Manager,\n\n124\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.700\nSCDPM.\n\n125\n00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.460\nSCDPM has centralized management and\n\n126\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.580\nit can maintain copies\nover the span of years.\n\n127\n00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.020\nAnd it does data deduplication and\nall that other stuff.\n\n128\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.130\nIt really does some impressive things and\nthat's all a part of SCDPM.\n\n129\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.430\nWhich is not free, right,\n\n130\n00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.100\nit's basically a purchase product,\npart of the system center suite.\n\n131\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.110\nAnd you can back up your systems,\nnot just Exchange, but really any server.\n\n132\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.820\nSo that's a great solution.\n\n133\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.120\nA big advantage of the SCDPM is that if\nyou have a problem you call Microsoft.\n\n134\n00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.580\nMicrosoft wrote the SCDPM.\n\n135\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.580\nThey wrote your operating system.\n\n136\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.750\nThey wrote Exchange.\n\n137\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.340\nIt's one person responsible for\n\n138\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.380\nall those different entities\nthat make support easier.\n\n139\n00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.409\nBut it's not as feature rich as some\nof the third party applications\n\n140\n00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:24.307\nthat are out there.\n\n141\n00:06:24.307 --> 00:06:28.909\nApplications like Symantec Backup Exec,\nArc Serve, Com Vault,\n\n142\n00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.702\nAcronis Advanced Backup for\nExchange, all of those.\n\n143\n00:06:32.702 --> 00:06:35.792\nThere's third party products that\ncan backup Exchange, and for\n\n144\n00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:39.880\nthe most part they're expensive,\nyou've got to buy them, right?\n\n145\n00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.240\nThey don't necessarily offer things\nbeyond with what you'd get with SCDPM or\n\n146\n00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.810\neven Windows Server Backup.\n\n147\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.450\nBut the big claim to fame that a lot\nof those third party softwares have,\n\n148\n00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.770\nis that they're very easy to use, and they\noffer single item recovery, all right.\n\n149\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.560\nIn Exchange, if we use Windows Server\nBackup or if we use the SCDPM,\n\n150\n00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.780\nyou can restore an entire mailbox\ndatabase, or you can restore\n\n151\n00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:09.580\nan individual mailbox, but\nyou can't restore an individual email.\n\n152\n00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.450\nRight.\nIf I just wanna get one email back,\n\n153\n00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.100\nI've gotta restore the whole mailbox.\n\n154\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.260\nOr I gotta restore\nthe whole mailbox database.\n\n155\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.232\nI can't just restore that one email.\n\n156\n00:07:18.232 --> 00:07:21.038\nSo if I'm looking for individual item\nrestore, I probably wanna look at\n\n157\n00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:23.990\nthe third parties, if that something\nthat's important to me, all right.\n\n158\n00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.197\nBut other than that, if I just want\nto be able to restore mailboxes or\n\n159\n00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:30.510\ndatabases we can use the software\nbuilt right into windows.\n\n160\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.435\nAnd let me show you, it's pretty easy.\n\n161\n00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:35.600\nSo the first thing we need\nto do is to recognize\n\n162\n00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.232\nthat the backup software's not\nactually installed by default.\n\n163\n00:07:38.232 --> 00:07:41.160\nSo we're going to have to get that\ninstalled and it's a little bit quirky.\n\n164\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.100\nFor example, well here let's start off\nright here, I am going to take my mailbox.\n\n165\n00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.580\nSo I'm logged into this server,\nthis is my mailbox.\n\n166\n00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.780\nAnd I'm just gonna send myself an email.\n\n167\n00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.965\nSo I'm gonna be a little\nschizophrenic today and email myself.\n\n168\n00:07:54.965 --> 00:08:00.816\nAnd I'll just say email\nsent prior to backup.\n\n169\n00:08:00.816 --> 00:08:01.930\nAll right.\n\n170\n00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.640\nAnd I'll just say,\nI sent this email prior to backing up.\n\n171\n00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.490\nAll right.\nThis way I'll have an email in my mailbox\n\n172\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.860\nthat I know was sent before\nI did any kind of backup.\n\n173\n00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.450\nAnd it'll take a second and it'll show up.\n\n174\n00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.520\nSo I'll have that.\n\n175\n00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.930\nNext I need to set up\nWindows Server Backup.\n\n176\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.680\nNow, Windows Server Backup, you can\nget to it through the Server Manager.\n\n177\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.790\nIf you go to the Server Manager and\n\n178\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.990\ngo up here to Tools, you'll see down here\nat the bottom Windows Server Backup.\n\n179\n00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.550\nAll right.\n\n180\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.070\nNow, on most servers like we'll\ntake this client access server.\n\n181\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.470\nIf I go to Tools and Windows Server\nBackup, it's right here in my Tool menu\n\n182\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.550\nbut when I launch it,\nit does this really annoying thing.\n\n183\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.440\nThe user interface,\nthe Admin Tools installed, but\n\n184\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.220\nthe actual backup software is not.\n\n185\n00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.650\nSo see how it's telling me here,\n\n186\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.870\nI can't actually do my own Local Backup\nbecause the software isn't installed.\n\n187\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.210\nSo I need to install it.\n\n188\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.080\nAnd the way we do that is by going\nback into our Server Manager.\n\n189\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.830\nAnd going to Manage and\nAdd Remove Roles and Features.\n\n190\n00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.440\nAnd the Windows Server Backup is\na feature, we just need to add that in.\n\n191\n00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.290\nSo if I move to the Wizard, I'll skip past\nthe Roles cuz I'm not messing with those.\n\n192\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.130\nBut here inside the Features,\nI can find Windows Server Backup.\n\n193\n00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.270\nI can check it and\nI can move forward, all right.\n\n194\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.810\nAnd that's gonna install\nthe actual backup software.\n\n195\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.680\nAnd I've already done that\nhere on my mailbox server.\n\n196\n00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.500\nSo this is my mailbox server,\nthis other one is my client access server.\n\n197\n00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.550\nBut here in my mailbox, if I go to\nTools and Windows Server Backup.\n\n198\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.500\nWhen I launch that and\n\n199\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.910\nI go to my Local Backup,\ninstead of telling me I can't do a backup,\n\n200\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.630\nit shows me what backups I already have\nand gives me the ability to schedule it.\n\n201\n00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.370\nSo, first off, we just need to\nget that installed, all right?\n\n202\n00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.050\nOnce that's done,\nwe're ready to start taking backups.\n\n203\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.170\nNow, Windows Server Backup can backup\nto a couple of different places.\n\n204\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.950\nIt can backup to a network share.\n\n205\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:47.860\nAnd that's kinda nice.\n\n206\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.170\nYou can create a centralized network\nshare somewhere that you send all\n\n207\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:50.780\nyour backups to.\n\n208\n00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:56.250\nBut the problem with the backups to\na network, is it only supports one backup.\n\n209\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.420\nSo every night or every hour,\nhowever often you run your backup,\n\n210\n00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.120\nyou're gonna be overwriting\nthe previous backup.\n\n211\n00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.960\nSo if you wanna maintain\nlike a backup history,\n\n212\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.160\nyou can't do that with a network share.\n\n213\n00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.280\nSo instead you could backup\nto some kind of local media.\n\n214\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.350\nLike I've added an extra hard drive to\nthis server, so I'll backup to that.\n\n215\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.660\nAnd that will let you\nbackup multiple backups.\n\n216\n00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.230\nOr you could back up to DVD or\ntape if you've got removable media.\n\n217\n00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.880\nThose are nice cuz you\ncould take them off-site.\n\n218\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.510\nThe hard drive I'm gonna back up to I\ncan't take off-site, it's in the server.\n\n219\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.540\nBut if you want removable media,\nit certainly supports that too.\n\n220\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.050\nYou just have to remember to go and\nchange the media out each day.\n\n221\n00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.620\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna take a backup of this server.\n\n222\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.500\nNow, I could set up a Backup Schedule and\nrun backups every night,\n\n223\n00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.040\nor however often it is I\nneeded to protect my data.\n\n224\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.580\nThink about your RPO, right.\n\n225\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.240\nYour Recovery Point Objective.\n\n226\n00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.340\nHow much data can you lose and\nit still be okay?\n\n227\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.390\nIf your company has a six-hour RPO,\n\n228\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.800\nthen I'm probably need to run\na backup every six hours.\n\n229\n00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.860\nSo that when there's a failure,\n\n230\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.950\nI know I have a backup within the last six\nhours and I can hit my RPO, all right.\n\n231\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.965\nBut what happens if a backup fails?\n\n232\n00:10:59.965 --> 00:11:01.735\nIf a backup fails and\nI'm running every 6 hours,\n\n233\n00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:04.005\nI could go 12 hours without a backup now.\n\n234\n00:11:04.005 --> 00:11:06.705\nAnd that would be a problem,\nI'd break my RPO.\n\n235\n00:11:06.705 --> 00:11:09.341\nSo you might even wanna go\nshorter than what your RPO is.\n\n236\n00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:13.165\nIf my RPO is every 6 hours, I might\nset the backups to run every 3 hours.\n\n237\n00:11:13.165 --> 00:11:15.315\nSo if one fails, I can correct it.\n\n238\n00:11:15.315 --> 00:11:17.735\nThe next one runs and\nI haven't gone beyond 6 hours, right?\n\n239\n00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:21.145\nSo, just be aware of little decisions like\nthat, that affect when our backups run.\n\n240\n00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.675\nI'm gonna go and do a one-time back up,\n\n241\n00:11:23.675 --> 00:11:26.050\ninstead of a schedule cuz\nit's just a lab server here.\n\n242\n00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.805\nThe first time you run it, it doesn't\nhave any previously scheduled options.\n\n243\n00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:32.190\nSo we have to define the options\nof what we wanna back up and so\n\n244\n00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.690\nI'll just choose Different Options and\ntell what to backup.\n\n245\n00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.970\nNow, when you do a backup,\n\n246\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.610\nyou can do a Custom backup and\njust backup exchange if you want.\n\n247\n00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.840\nBut it's not recommended.\n\n248\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.260\nMicrosoft recommends doing\na full server backup.\n\n249\n00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.280\nAnd the reason is,\nit gives you the most flexibility.\n\n250\n00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.440\nWith the full server backup,\nif your entire server gets destroyed.\n\n251\n00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.930\nWell, you can restore the backup and\nit will install Windows.\n\n252\n00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.172\nIt'll put Exchange back on it.\n\n253\n00:11:58.172 --> 00:12:01.698\nIt will put your mailbox database\nto get you a bare metal recovery.\n\n254\n00:12:01.698 --> 00:12:04.642\nYou could bind an entirely new server and\nhave it backup and\n\n255\n00:12:04.642 --> 00:12:08.028\nrunning in short order with a full backup,\nright?\n\n256\n00:12:08.028 --> 00:12:10.140\nAlso with the full backup,\nmaybe my server's fine,\n\n257\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.570\nit's just the database that's corrupt.\n\n258\n00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.170\nI can restore just the database,\nso I have that flexibility.\n\n259\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.830\nIf I go Custom, I start losing\nthe ability to restore certain things.\n\n260\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.370\nSo, we typically wanna\ndo a Full server backup.\n\n261\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.960\nThen it's gonna ask where\nI wanna back it up to.\n\n262\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.030\nAnd I can back up to\na Remote shared folder.\n\n263\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.610\nIf I have a DVD drive or if I have\na tape drive, I can back up to those.\n\n264\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.910\nBut I'm gonna back up to an extra\nhard drive that I've got and\n\n265\n00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.370\nI'll just pick that hard drive right here.\n\n266\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.780\nIt's my E drive.\n\n267\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.290\nNow, when you choose a full back up, by\ndefault it's gonna backup all your drives.\n\n268\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.890\nWhich would include my E-drive, so it's\ngonna ask me if I want to exclude that.\n\n269\n00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:49.120\nHere we go and I'll go and say yes to\nexclude it, don't back up the E drive.\n\n270\n00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.750\nAnd so now I can see it's gonna\ndo a Bare metal recovery,\n\n271\n00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.400\nbacking up the whole server.\n\n272\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.160\nIt's gonna get the entire C drive and\nit's gonna get my System state.\n\n273\n00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.780\nThe System state includes my registry,\n\n274\n00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.280\nas well as some of\nthe Exchange configuration.\n\n275\n00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.270\nThe bulk of my Exchange configuration\nis in the Active Directory though, so\n\n276\n00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.570\nI don't actually have to back that up.\n\n277\n00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.570\nIt'll be replicated with the AD.\n\n278\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.490\nIt's the databases on the C\ndrive that I really care about.\n\n279\n00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.400\nNow I'll go and hit Backup and\nnow it's gonna back my server up.\n\n280\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.650\nNow, depending on the size of your server,\nthis can take a while, right?\n\n281\n00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:22.637\nMy server, I think is probably\naround 23 or 24 gigs of data, so\n\n282\n00:13:22.637 --> 00:13:24.430\nit's gonna run that backup.\n\n283\n00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.700\nAnd it'll take it just a little while\nto get that copied over and in-place.\n\n284\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.750\nNow while that's running, let me talk\nabout what's happening in the background.\n\n285\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.280\nIn the background, the Volume\nShadow Copy Service is kicking in.\n\n286\n00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.350\nAnd it's taking a snapshot of\nmy server as it is right now.\n\n287\n00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.750\nSo it's already done that, okay.\n\n288\n00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.120\nThen when it starts to back up, it's\nbacking up that Volume Shadow Copy image.\n\n289\n00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.280\nSo if new email comes in right now, well,\n\n290\n00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.740\nthe Volume Shadow Copy\nsnapshot was already taken.\n\n291\n00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.440\nSo, if my backup's set to start at 6 PM,\nit takes the snapshot at 6 PM and\n\n292\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.570\nit backs up my server\nexactly as it is at 6 PM.\n\n293\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.150\nIf the backup takes 30 minutes,\nnew email comes in between 6 pm and 6:30.\n\n294\n00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.950\nBut it's not a part of the backup, because\nwe're backing up that snapshot, all right?\n\n295\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.240\nSo that's all happening in the background.\n\n296\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.540\nAnd we don't have to\nget involved with that.\n\n297\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.240\nThat's all automatic and that's just\nkind of occurring without us, all right.\n\n298\n00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.865\nIn the meantime,\nit's writing this backup to the drive.\n\n299\n00:14:15.865 --> 00:14:20.090\nAnd when it writes it to the drive, if I\nbrowse to it here, we can kinda see it.\n\n300\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.940\nIt's creating this WindowsImageBackup\nfolder and it's giving the server name.\n\n301\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.330\nCuz you could actually store backups from\nmore than one server in the same location.\n\n302\n00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:28.770\nSo here's my LAB-MAILBOX01,\n\n303\n00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.240\nand as I browse into that, we can\nsee the actual backup being created.\n\n304\n00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.070\nNow, we can't really look at\nthe backup files cuz they're VHDs,\n\n305\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.640\nthey're virtual hard drives and\nthat's pretty awesome.\n\n306\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.680\nBecause it means when\nI restore this server,\n\n307\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.920\nI could restore it to a physical server or\na virtual server.\n\n308\n00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.130\nYou could restore this right into Hyper-V\nto get back up and running pretty quickly.\n\n309\n00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.190\nIt's neat.\nThey support that.\n\n310\n00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.290\nNow, other things we need to think about.\n\n311\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.200\nI'm backing up a mailbox server, right?\n\n312\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.280\nA mailbox server has\na mailbox database on it.\n\n313\n00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.280\nIt's got our email and\nwe know that's important.\n\n314\n00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.940\nWe know we need to back that up.\n\n315\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.340\nSo on a mailbox server,\n\n316\n00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.680\nthe key thing that I need to back\nup is that mailbox database.\n\n317\n00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.270\nBut there's some other stuff on the\nmailbox server that's important, right.\n\n318\n00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.940\nThings that we kind of forget about.\n\n319\n00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.870\nFor example, on your mailbox server, you\nmight have your transport rules defined.\n\n320\n00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.470\nWell the transport rules get partly\nstored in the Active Directory, but\n\n321\n00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.430\nthen they get applied\non the server itself.\n\n322\n00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.370\nAnd so, those are getting backed\nup as a part of this too.\n\n323\n00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.060\nAlso, if we're using\nthe Unified Communications Management,\n\n324\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.278\nwe might have custom audio prompts.\n\n325\n00:15:27.278 --> 00:15:31.270\nThere's these default ones that come with\nMicrosoft's Unified Communication Solution\n\n326\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.260\nwith Lync.\n\n327\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.950\nBut if you record custom ones,\nyour own voice, your company's name.\n\n328\n00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.330\nThose actually get stored on\nyour mailbox server where\n\n329\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.400\nthe Unified Communication Service\nis running.\n\n330\n00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.490\nAnd so when we run this backup,\nwe're backing those up too.\n\n331\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.330\nAnd that's pretty important.\n\n332\n00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.660\nWe wanna make sure that we get those.\n\n333\n00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.442\n[COUGH] Some of the other things,\nif you've got message tracking turned on.\n\n334\n00:15:49.442 --> 00:15:51.496\nThose log files are getting\nstored on your servers, so\n\n335\n00:15:51.496 --> 00:15:52.981\nwe're backing up those logs, right?\n\n336\n00:15:52.981 --> 00:15:54.606\nThose are all different things.\n\n337\n00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:56.633\nBut if you're not using\nUnified Communications,\n\n338\n00:15:56.633 --> 00:15:58.528\nif you don't have message\ntracking turned on.\n\n339\n00:15:58.528 --> 00:16:01.139\nThen it's the mailbox data,\nthis is what you really care about, and\n\n340\n00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:02.683\nthese are getting backed up right here.\n\n341\n00:16:02.683 --> 00:16:05.881\nNow, the other server type that we\nhave is the client access server,\n\n342\n00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:07.994\nwe probably need to back that up too,\nright?\n\n343\n00:16:07.994 --> 00:16:10.280\nWell, not really.\n\n344\n00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.210\nWhat's on your client access server?\n\n345\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.490\nAt the end of the day, your client\naccess server doesn't have mail queues.\n\n346\n00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.560\nRight?\nCuz it runs the front end\n\n347\n00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.300\ntransport service.\n\n348\n00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.690\nIt doesn't run the hub\ntransport service anymore.\n\n349\n00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.210\nSo it doesn't have mail queues,\n\n350\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.530\nit doesn't have mailboxes,\nit just has the Outlook WebApp webpages.\n\n351\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.010\nIt's got the Exchange control panel,\nthe Exchange administration center.\n\n352\n00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.950\nThose things, but those, you can get those\nright off the install disk of Exchange.\n\n353\n00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.830\nWe don't need to back those up, do we?\n\n354\n00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.960\nSo really the only thing on a client\naccess server that's important to us\n\n355\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.400\nis the certificate.\n\n356\n00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.350\nIf you've purchased a certificate from\nan outside vendor, an SSL certificate, and\n\n357\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.140\nyou've got it attached to OWA and\n\n358\n00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.420\nthe other services that are there,\nthat's kind of important.\n\n359\n00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.950\nWe want that, right?\n\n360\n00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.160\nBut everything else in the client\naccess server is really not a big deal.\n\n361\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.920\nYou can easily just reinstall Exchange and\n\n362\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.190\nhave that back, attach your\ncertificate and you're in business.\n\n363\n00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.170\nSo your client access servers,\nyou might not even back those up.\n\n364\n00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.440\nI know plenty of people don't.\n\n365\n00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.460\nPlenty of people do.\n\n366\n00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.630\nYou can do a full metal backup\nof your client access server and\n\n367\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:10.120\nquickly recover from it, but\nif your backup is a week, a month,\n\n368\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.560\neven a year or old and\na client access server,\n\n369\n00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.750\nthe only thing you're gonna miss out\non are your Windows updates, right.\n\n370\n00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.910\nAnd if you've issued a new certificate so\n\n371\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.540\nyour client access servers\nare a lot less sensitive.\n\n372\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.430\nThat you don't have to back them up as\noften as you do your mailbox server.\n\n373\n00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.380\nAll right, so my mailbox backup\njust finished right there.\n\n374\n00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.835\nSo I go and hit close, so\nI got a good backup taken off my database.\n\n375\n00:17:30.835 --> 00:17:34.700\nNow what I can do is I can\njump back to my mailbox.\n\n376\n00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.540\nAnd in my mailbox,\nI'm gonna send myself another email.\n\n377\n00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.230\nSo I'll just fire off another email to me,\nemailing myself today.\n\n378\n00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.460\nAnd this one will be email\nsent after the backup.\n\n379\n00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:47.700\nAll right?\n\n380\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:53.140\nSo, now I've got content in my\nmailbox that was sent prior to and\n\n381\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:53.990\nafter the backup.\n\n382\n00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.950\nAnd I can see that prior to email right\nthere and there's the one sent after.\n\n383\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:02.140\nAll right, so I'm in my mailbox,\nthings are running great.\n\n384\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.660\nAnd then something happens.\n\n385\n00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.300\nSomething happens and it could be a little\nproblem, it could be a big problem.\n\n386\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.371\nIt could be my entire server is destroyed.\n\n387\n00:18:09.371 --> 00:18:13.011\nIf my entire server is destroyed,\nI go in and buy a new server and\n\n388\n00:18:13.011 --> 00:18:15.141\nI take this full back-up that I did,\n\n389\n00:18:15.141 --> 00:18:19.979\nI boot off a Windows Server 2012 disc and\nI tell it I want to do a restore, right?\n\n390\n00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:23.813\nIt's in the menu options of the installer\nin Windows Server 2012 and you point it\n\n391\n00:18:23.813 --> 00:18:27.320\nto this full back-up and it restores\nmy server and we're back in business.\n\n392\n00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.880\nThat's easy, we've seen that.\n\n393\n00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.510\nIf you've watched our Windows Server 2012\nshows, we've shown that process before.\n\n394\n00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.910\nBut what if my server's okay?\n\n395\n00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:39.480\nWhat if it's not the server that's failed,\nbut it's the database itself?\n\n396\n00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.730\nMaybe the rate array the database\nwas sitting on got corrupted.\n\n397\n00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:47.080\nMaybe an antivirus software quarantined\nsome of my transaction log files and\n\n398\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.710\nreally hosed things up that way.\n\n399\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.570\nMaybe the database just got\ncorrupted somehow right?\n\n400\n00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.910\nMaybe some virus has\nspread throughout it and\n\n401\n00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.520\nI just want to restore the database,\nnot the whole server right?\n\n402\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.240\nJust the database, well we can do that.\n\n403\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.650\nFirst off let me simulate a problem, I'm\ngonna take our database and so I'll just\n\n404\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.360\ngo down here to servers and databases,\nand I'm gonna dismount my database.\n\n405\n00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.310\nAnd that's going to take it offline.\n\n406\n00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.110\nSo as soon as that database is offline,\n\n407\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.070\nnow users can't get to their\nemail anymore, all right?\n\n408\n00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.210\nAnd then I'm gonna go and rename\nthe database file so that its missing.\n\n409\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.580\nSo that's dismounting in the background.\n\n410\n00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.840\nAnd I'm going to browse in my hard\ndrive to where that database is.\n\n411\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.220\nBuried 20 directories deep,\nwhich I will get to eventually.\n\n412\n00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.220\nAnd I'll find that mailbox database.\n\n413\n00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:33.920\nThere it is.\n\n414\n00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.990\nSo there's the mailbox database, and let\nme just make sure it actually dismounted.\n\n415\n00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.030\nIt did.\nAnd I'm just going to rename that file.\n\n416\n00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.090\nRight?\nSo, I'll just stick like .old on the end.\n\n417\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.740\nAnd that database is now gone as\nfar as the system is concerned.\n\n418\n00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.140\nAnd gone, corrupted, failed,\nwhatever it doesn't matter.\n\n419\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.100\nIf the raid array failed, I need to go and\nreplace the hard drives and this\n\n420\n00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.310\nwas stored on, let's say it was stored\non my D drive or F drive or whatever.\n\n421\n00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.900\nI would just need to make sure I\nhad a D or an F drive back again.\n\n422\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.760\nRight?\nYou want to recreate that same path\n\n423\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.250\nthat you had before.\n\n424\n00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.210\nAnd now we can run a restore.\n\n425\n00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.190\nAnd when you run your restore you're\njust gonna restore the database\n\n426\n00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.530\nright back on to the server.\n\n427\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.210\nOkay?\n\n428\n00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.190\nSo fortunately we don't\nhave to do a full restore.\n\n429\n00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.080\nMy backup was 21 gigs in size.\n\n430\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.070\nBut that mailbox database,\nit's only 250 megs.\n\n431\n00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:24.830\nSo I don't want to restore 21 gigs of\ndata when I only need 10% of that.\n\n432\n00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:31.270\nI need a much smaller sized amount of\ndata or not 10%, just 1% of that data.\n\n433\n00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.630\n[LAUGH] Any how let me go in here and\nI'm gonna restore just that database.\n\n434\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:39.080\nSo what we do is we jump back into\nour Windows Server backup and,\n\n435\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.650\nover on the right side\nyou can choose recover,\n\n436\n00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.310\nand when you go to recover, it's asking\nyou what server you wanna recover.\n\n437\n00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.060\nI'm recovering this one.\n\n438\n00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.700\nAnd then it asks you to pick a date.\n\n439\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.480\nIf you've got more than one backup,\n\n440\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.900\nyou can choose what date\nyou wanna roll back to.\n\n441\n00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.660\nNormally we want the newest\nbackup available and\n\n442\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.970\nthat's what it's gonna choose by default.\n\n443\n00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.120\nSo it's showing my newest\nbackup is today at 10:04 AM.\n\n444\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.580\nThat's the one that I'm gonna restore.\n\n445\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.170\nAll right.\n\n446\n00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.440\nBut I could go back in time if\nthat's what I was looking to do.\n\n447\n00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.450\nAnd it'll have any date that has\nthe back up will be written in bold.\n\n448\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.680\nSee how that 19 is kinda bold but\nthe other numbers aren't?\n\n449\n00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.180\nAnd that's letting me know\nthere's a backup on that date.\n\n450\n00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.030\nAll right, now's where things\nget a little bit tricky.\n\n451\n00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.190\nWhen you go to do the restore you\ncan restore entire hard drives,\n\n452\n00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.770\nyou can restore files and folders.\n\n453\n00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.810\nWhat we want to restore is an application.\n\n454\n00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.890\nYou might be tempted to choose files and\nfolders, and\n\n455\n00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.880\nif you do that you could go and you could\nchoose that EDB file and restore it.\n\n456\n00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.430\nThe problem is,\nwhat about your transaction logs?\n\n457\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:36.200\nWhat about the other things that\nare associated with that database?\n\n458\n00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.210\nWell those might be messed up too and so\n\n459\n00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.810\nwe might need to bring in\nthat whole database itself.\n\n460\n00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.350\nSo it's better to choose applications.\n\n461\n00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.930\nWhen you choose applications\nyou can move forward and\n\n462\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.880\nMicrosoft Exchange will be\nright there in the list.\n\n463\n00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.480\nThat was part of the system\nstate that was backed up.\n\n464\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.340\nAnd so I've got that Exchange backup and\n\n465\n00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:57.040\nif I view its details I can see\nright here that it's got that\n\n466\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.680\nmailbox backup right there and\nthat's got my Exchange databases in there.\n\n467\n00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.180\nSo that's the one that I want.\n\n468\n00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.500\nNow I do have to make a decision.\n\n469\n00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.720\nIf I do full backups every night,\nI'm gonna restore a full backup and\n\n470\n00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.200\nmy database will be back online and\nthat'll be great.\n\n471\n00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.110\nAll right?\n\n472\n00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.110\nBut what if I run a full\nbackup at midnight and\n\n473\n00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:19.220\nthen I run incremental backups\nevery day at, or every hour.\n\n474\n00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.700\nWe'll say every hour,\nI run an incremental backup.\n\n475\n00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.830\nWell, I would need to recover my full\nbackup, and then follow that up by doing\n\n476\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.640\nall my incremental's to get\nback to current, all right.\n\n477\n00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.590\nNow if we're doing the back ups right\nhere in the Windows server back up and\n\n478\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.490\nwe're doing the back ups on disk or\n\n479\n00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:39.370\nnetwork share, well I don't have to worry\nabout that, it'll figure that out for me.\n\n480\n00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.100\nBut if I'm doing the back ups to tape or\n\n481\n00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.570\nDVD, I\"m gonna have to\nrestore the full one first.\n\n482\n00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.680\nAnd then restore each of the incrementals\nall the way back to the latest one to get\n\n483\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.520\nback in business.\n\n484\n00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.532\nSo if I'm gonna have to do more than one\nrestore it's really important that I check\n\n485\n00:22:52.532 --> 00:22:53.570\nthis option here.\n\n486\n00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.930\nDo not perform a roll four recovery\nof the application database.\n\n487\n00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.070\nAll right.\n\n488\n00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:02.380\nWhat happens is on your very last restore,\nso let's say you have to do five,\n\n489\n00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.760\nyou have a full and\nthen four incrementals.\n\n490\n00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.680\nOn the very last one, you uncheck this,\nand it'll restore the database and\n\n491\n00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.000\nbring it live.\n\n492\n00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.770\nBut if you've got more backups to restore,\nyou check this, and\n\n493\n00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.770\nthat says, go ahead and restore the data,\nbut don't bring the database live yet.\n\n494\n00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.300\nHold it down so\nwe can continue doing more restores.\n\n495\n00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.040\nAnd on the last one you'll uncheck that,\nand then we'll be done.\n\n496\n00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.540\nI just have one full back up,\nso this is my last one.\n\n497\n00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.870\nI'll leave that unchecked and\nI'll move forward.\n\n498\n00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.820\nAnd it's gonna restore.\n\n499\n00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.820\nNow, if my database was corrupted,\n\n500\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.000\nI just want to restore right\nback to the original location.\n\n501\n00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.430\nBut that's gonna restore\nthe whole mailbox database.\n\n502\n00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:44.825\nIf I just want one person's mailbox,\nI can recover to another location and\n\n503\n00:23:44.825 --> 00:23:46.091\nlift it out of there.\n\n504\n00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:49.641\nOr, if I'm trying to recover this,\nand the hard drive isn't available and\n\n505\n00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:53.356\nI have a different drive letter, I can\nchoose to recover to another location and\n\n506\n00:23:53.356 --> 00:23:54.648\nsend it to that other spot.\n\n507\n00:23:54.648 --> 00:23:56.365\nSo I got a couple of\ndifferent choices here.\n\n508\n00:23:56.365 --> 00:24:00.442\nBut typically we're just gonna recover to\nthe original location to get this database\n\n509\n00:24:00.442 --> 00:24:01.810\nback online.\n\n510\n00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.250\nAnd so when I move forward it's\ngot all the information it needs,\n\n511\n00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.610\nit's gonna restore, and this will run\nmuch faster than the backup because I'm\n\n512\n00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.150\njust restoring my Exchange\ndata not the whole server.\n\n513\n00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:15.230\nSo it should be, I don't know,\nsomewhere in the 300 meg range.\n\n514\n00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.610\nThe database itself was 250 megs.\n\n515\n00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.300\nBut then you've got some other Exchange\nfiles that it's gonna replace and\n\n516\n00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.490\nput back, too.\n\n517\n00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.330\nSo that restore's gonna run.\n\n518\n00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:27.930\nWhen it's done, my database will be\nback because I unchecked the option in\n\n519\n00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.710\nthe menu there, it's gonna automatically\nbring the database alive and\n\n520\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.930\nmy users should be able to get\nback into their email again.\n\n521\n00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:34.610\nOkay?\n\n522\n00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.160\nSo that's happening right now.\n\n523\n00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.100\nSee how it says preparing to recover?\n\n524\n00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.420\nWhat it's doing is it's going through and\nadjusting a few little settings for us.\n\n525\n00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.190\nSome of the settings are ones\nthat we can't even adjust for\n\n526\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.850\nourselves, just getting\nthat database ready.\n\n527\n00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.410\nIf the database records are already\nthere and the database is mounted,\n\n528\n00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.440\nit's gotta dismount the database to\nbe able to do this restore, and so\n\n529\n00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.300\nit'll do that process in the background.\n\n530\n00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.540\nSo, there it goes actually running,\n270 megs of data,\n\n531\n00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.870\nso just under that 300 megs that I said.\n\n532\n00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.520\nAnd see how it says it's done 100%\nrecovered, but it's still working?\n\n533\n00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.850\nIt's gotta roll forward the transaction\nlogs on the database, and\n\n534\n00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:08.950\nthen it's gotta bring it live.\n\n535\n00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:09.990\nSo it's doing that.\n\n536\n00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.730\nAnd it's not until the database is\nactually live that it'll say that it's\n\n537\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.270\nfinished, so we'll give it a moment.\n\n538\n00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.250\nBut if we look on the hard drive,\nwe can see what it's doing.\n\n539\n00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.360\nSee how it restored that EDB file?\n\n540\n00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.710\nSo it brought that back from the backup.\n\n541\n00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:22.940\nThere's the one that I renamed,\nstill sitting there.\n\n542\n00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.770\nBut that's the one that it just\nrestored and brought back online.\n\n543\n00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.710\nAll right.\n\n544\n00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:29.840\nSo now that it says that it's done,\n\n545\n00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.710\nI should be able to log back into my\nmailbox and let's see what we get, right?\n\n546\n00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:40.410\nI'm gonna open up a new OWA window,\nand we'll get connected into that.\n\n547\n00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:44.390\nNow, if I try to log in while my database\nwas offline, I would have gotten\n\n548\n00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:48.850\nan error message, saying that it couldn't\ncontact it, but I log in and here I am.\n\n549\n00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.300\nI got logged in, I'm in my mailbox, and\n\n550\n00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.936\nnotice something,\nhere's my email sent prior to the backup,\n\n551\n00:25:55.936 --> 00:25:57.980\nhere's my email sent after the backup,\nhow do they get that?\n\n552\n00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.107\nHow do they get an email\nsent after the backup?\n\n553\n00:26:00.107 --> 00:26:02.428\nI renamed the database, right?\n\n554\n00:26:02.428 --> 00:26:04.912\nSo the database was completely deleted and\n\n555\n00:26:04.912 --> 00:26:08.987\nsomehow I magically got an email\nthat wasn't included in the backup.\n\n556\n00:26:08.987 --> 00:26:10.210\nAll right?\n\n557\n00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:13.610\nHow that worked is with transaction logs,\nright?\n\n558\n00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.910\nWhen you send a change\nto an Exchange database,\n\n559\n00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.950\nthe change doesn't go\ndirectly to the database.\n\n560\n00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.970\nIt goes to the transaction logs first.\n\n561\n00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:26.770\nOnce it's in the transaction logs,\nthen, it gets written to the database.\n\n562\n00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.340\nWell, the change stays\nin the transaction logs.\n\n563\n00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.660\nIt stays there until\nyou run another backup.\n\n564\n00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.100\nI haven't run another backup.\n\n565\n00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.320\nSo, that new email was in\nthose transaction logs, and\n\n566\n00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.220\nso exchange saw that and said hey,\nI'm gonna put the database back but\n\n567\n00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.400\noh look, you've got some transaction logs.\n\n568\n00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.170\nLet me roll those forward too, and\n\n569\n00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.830\nthat means I was able to recover\nright to the point of failure.\n\n570\n00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.470\nAnd I didn't loose one single email,\n\n571\n00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.550\nmy RPO here was zero,\nmy recovery point was zero.\n\n572\n00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.494\nI didn't lose any data, that's perfect.\n\n573\n00:26:56.494 --> 00:27:00.471\nIf you can recover your transaction logs,\nyou can get right to the point of failure,\n\n574\n00:27:00.471 --> 00:27:01.450\nall right?\n\n575\n00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.500\nInstead if I had lost all of my data,\nso if I go back here and\n\n576\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.190\nI'll dismount that database, see,\nI was mounted again, so I'll dismount it.\n\n577\n00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.643\nAnd if I had been\na little more aggressive,\n\n578\n00:27:12.643 --> 00:27:15.234\ninstead of just deleting\nthe database file,\n\n579\n00:27:15.234 --> 00:27:20.225\nif I had deleted the transaction logs too,\nthen I would have lost everything, right?\n\n580\n00:27:20.225 --> 00:27:22.050\nEverything after the backup.\n\n581\n00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:26.270\nSo, now if I go in here, so I dismounted\nthe database, if I go into this folder and\n\n582\n00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.880\nI take all this data, and\nI'm just gonna delete it all, right?\n\n583\n00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.626\nLook who's go crazy?\n\n584\n00:27:30.626 --> 00:27:33.302\nLet's see.\n\n585\n00:27:33.302 --> 00:27:34.270\nFolder's open somewhere.\n\n586\n00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.170\nBut I'll delete everything else.\n\n587\n00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.230\nThere we go.\nAll right, so\n\n588\n00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.780\nI just deleted my transaction logs too.\n\n589\n00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.550\nLet's say I lost it all.\n\n590\n00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.660\nIf you lose it all when\nyou do the restore,\n\n591\n00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.070\nthere's no transaction\nlogs to play forward.\n\n592\n00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.630\nAnd so now,\njust gonna recover what's in the backup.\n\n593\n00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:50.480\nSo, if I go back and redo that recovery,\nI'll come back here and\n\n594\n00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.070\nrestore it, restoring that same back up.\n\n595\n00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.790\nI'll choose applications.\n\n596\n00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:58.080\nThe only difference this time,\nis there's no transaction logs for\n\n597\n00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.380\nit to play forward.\n\n598\n00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.850\nSince it can't play those forward,\n\n599\n00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.600\nI'll lose that email that\ncame in after my back up.\n\n600\n00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.980\nSo, that's where it's important, right?\n\n601\n00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.990\nIf we had lost our entire server,\nthis is a question from the chat room,\n\n602\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:13.110\nif we lost the whole server, then we\nlost the transaction logs too, right?\n\n603\n00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.700\nSo when we went and did the restore,\n\n604\n00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.160\nwe would just have what was in the back\nup, and so we wouldn't get that stuff.\n\n605\n00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.600\nBut, remember way back in\nthe beginning of this series where\n\n606\n00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.370\nI talked about planning storage?\n\n607\n00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.010\nIf your transaction logs are on\none set of hard drives, and\n\n608\n00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.520\nyour database is on another set of hard\ndrives, and it's the hard drive your\n\n609\n00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.900\ndatabase is on that failed,\nyour transaction logs are still intact.\n\n610\n00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.120\nAnd so you can restore just your\ndatabase and now you're back up and\n\n611\n00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.150\nhappy again and it rolls forward\nthose transaction logs, right?\n\n612\n00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:42.210\nThat's how we make sure\nwe don't lose any data.\n\n613\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.330\nAnd that's another reason why you\nwanna store your transaction logs on\n\n614\n00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:50.550\na separate hard drive from your database,\nfor recovery purposes, right?\n\n615\n00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.739\nSo this is gonna run the restore.\n\n616\n00:28:51.739 --> 00:28:54.283\nIt's gonna notice that I don't\nhave any transaction logs and so\n\n617\n00:28:54.283 --> 00:28:57.263\nit's gonna create empty ones and\nbring that database back up and running.\n\n618\n00:28:57.263 --> 00:29:00.008\nSo, all right.\n\n619\n00:29:00.008 --> 00:29:03.985\nSo once this is in place, we'll be back\nin business and we should see that other\n\n620\n00:29:03.985 --> 00:29:07.605\nemail unless it found some other\nmagical way to get that missing email,\n\n621\n00:29:07.605 --> 00:29:08.470\nit'll be gone.\n\n622\n00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.290\nNow when I say other magical ways,\n\n623\n00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.600\nthere are actually some\nmagical ways that can do that.\n\n624\n00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.700\nWhat if you have\na Database Availability Group?\n\n625\n00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.130\nIf you have a DAG, your database is\nbeing copied to another server so\n\n626\n00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.940\nwhen you reach toward this one,\nthe other servers got newer data,\n\n627\n00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.200\nit will actually pull that back.\n\n628\n00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.460\nAnd so we might get it from there.\n\n629\n00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.560\nRight?\nThere are other places\n\n630\n00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.610\nthe email can come from.\n\n631\n00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:29.060\nExchange will automatically try to\nget you to the newest, latest and\n\n632\n00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.672\ngreatest copy of your data through\nwhatever means that it can.\n\n633\n00:29:32.672 --> 00:29:35.600\nAll right my restore just finished,\nI can see that it's completed.\n\n634\n00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.700\nSo if I jump back here and\nlet me get back into my mailbox.\n\n635\n00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.553\nI'll just open up a new OWA window,\nno sense trying to reuse one, and\n\n636\n00:29:42.553 --> 00:29:45.018\nwhen I get logged in this time,\nthere we go.\n\n637\n00:29:45.018 --> 00:29:48.774\nI'm back in my mailbox, I've got\nthe email sent prior to the backup, but\n\n638\n00:29:48.774 --> 00:29:51.089\nI lost the one sent after the backup,\nright?\n\n639\n00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:54.249\nSo, that's an example right there\nof how important it is to try and\n\n640\n00:29:54.249 --> 00:29:56.680\nrecover our transaction\nlog files if we can.\n\n641\n00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.720\nIf we can save those transaction logs we\ncan get right to the point of failure and\n\n642\n00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.240\nlose no email.\n\n643\n00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.370\nThat's the perfect solution.\n\n644\n00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.520\nThat's really when you know\nyou've done a great job.\n\n645\n00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.450\nAll right, well,\nwhat we just saw in this episode,\n\n646\n00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.750\ncuz that's really about all I've got for\nstandard back ups.\n\n647\n00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.970\nSo what we saw in this episode was\nhow to do a standard back up of\n\n648\n00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.390\nan Exchange Server,\nhow to restore that and get us back up and\n\n649\n00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.130\nrunning, and save the day, right?\n\n650\n00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.090\nYou saw that backup,\nit did not take long to restore.\n\n651\n00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.960\nNow my mailbox database is pretty small.\n\n652\n00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.980\nIf you've got a terabyte backup, it's\ngonna take a while to restore that, right?\n\n653\n00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.540\nAnd so that's recovery time objective,\nwe've gotta be aware of it.\n\n654\n00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.830\nBut being able to quickly and\neasily get that data right back in there,\n\n655\n00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.310\nget it back in business?\n\n656\n00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.870\nWell, it wasn't that hard.\n\n657\n00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.480\nAnd we did it with software included\nright here in Windows Server.\n\n658\n00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.160\nThere's third party options you\nalways wanna consider, right?\n\n659\n00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.430\nThose have their pros and cons.\n\n660\n00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.680\nBut as far as simple, straightforward\nbackups, this one works really well and\n\n661\n00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.790\nit's right there.\n\n662\n00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:55.530\nNow, that's not the last that\nI have to say on recovery.\n\n663\n00:30:55.530 --> 00:31:00.630\nWhat I just gave you is a very typical\nrestore for a full server failure, right?\n\n664\n00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.800\nBut there's other types of recovery\nthat you might need to do.\n\n665\n00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.310\nAnd if you have a gigantic database and\nRPO is a problem, there's something\n\n666\n00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:12.220\ncalled a dial tone recovery we can use to\nshrink that RPO really, really small and\n\n667\n00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:12.810\nreally help out.\n\n668\n00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:17.030\nSo stay tuned for those episodes where\nI show some alternative methods for\n\n669\n00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.890\nbacking up and recover.\n\n670\n00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.760\nBut for\nthis episode we'll wrap it up here.\n\n671\n00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:26.090\nSo, signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you next time.\n\n672\n00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:30.940\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:26.381\nof an exchange mailbox database.\n\n9\n00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:28.494\nNow, what is dial tone recovery?\n\n10\n00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:32.013\nWell, in our previous episodes,\nwe talked about how to back-up and\n\n11\n00:00:32.013 --> 00:00:34.988\nrestore an exchange database,\nand during that process,\n\n12\n00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:38.226\nyou assume that your database\nhas failed and has gone offline.\n\n13\n00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:40.102\nAnd now we need to do the restore.\n\n14\n00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:43.408\nAnd, while you're restoring\nyou're in what's called your RTO,\n\n15\n00:00:43.408 --> 00:00:44.974\nyour recovery time objective.\n\n16\n00:00:44.974 --> 00:00:48.440\nIt's the amount of time it takes you\nto get the database back online.\n\n17\n00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.092\nThe bigger your database gets,\nthe longer it takes to get back online.\n\n18\n00:00:53.092 --> 00:00:57.223\nSo, if your database is a terabyte and\nit's spread across five backup tapes,\n\n19\n00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.355\nmaybe you've got a full backup and\nseveral incrementals,\n\n20\n00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:02.374\nit can take a while to do that restore.\n\n21\n00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:05.131\nSo, if it takes you two\nhours to do that restore,\n\n22\n00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:09.320\nthat's two hours that your fellow\nemployees can't access their email.\n\n23\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.829\nNow, new emails coming in, and it's\ngetting put into the mail queues on your\n\n24\n00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.292\nclient access server, or on your\nmailbox server, if they're available.\n\n25\n00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:20.682\nIf they're not available,\nthen the mail's getting bounced, right?\n\n26\n00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:23.500\nPeople are trying to do retries,\nand if they're doing retries,\n\n27\n00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.842\nyou've only got 72 hours, before most\nmail servers give up on that email.\n\n28\n00:01:26.842 --> 00:01:29.257\nSo, you have this kind of time limit.\n\n29\n00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:32.541\nYou need to get your mailbox database\nback up as quickly as you can, but\n\n30\n00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:34.163\nyou wanna restore your user data.\n\n31\n00:01:34.163 --> 00:01:38.374\nAnd the larger your mailbox database is,\nthe harder that becomes.\n\n32\n00:01:38.374 --> 00:01:42.222\nSo, a dial tone recovery\nseeks to help us fix that.\n\n33\n00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:47.124\nA dial tone recovery makes our recovery\ntime objective, our RTO, it makes it zero.\n\n34\n00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:50.639\nIt allows us to get a database back up and\nrunning instantly.\n\n35\n00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:53.430\nNow, there's pros and\ncons to doing it this way, but\n\n36\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.861\nthe way that it works is it basically\nbrings up an empty database.\n\n37\n00:01:56.861 --> 00:01:58.692\nIt says okay, your database is lost.\n\n38\n00:01:58.692 --> 00:01:59.841\nThat really stinks.\n\n39\n00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:02.483\nWe don't want that but\nwe know you need to get around it.\n\n40\n00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:07.390\nBut for right now, let's bring up\nan empty database and let users get in.\n\n41\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.249\nUsers will be able to get into\nthe mailbox, and it will be empty.\n\n42\n00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:16.444\nBut, they can send email and new email\ncoming in will come into their mailbox.\n\n43\n00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:18.531\nSo, they're able to work.\n\n44\n00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.714\nThey can get in, they can send email,\nthey can receive email.\n\n45\n00:02:20.714 --> 00:02:23.626\nYou're back and\nonline in a matter of moments.\n\n46\n00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:24.427\nAll right.\n\n47\n00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:26.342\nBut what about all your old email?\n\n48\n00:02:26.342 --> 00:02:27.682\nWell, now that the server's online,\n\n49\n00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:29.518\nyou don't have to worry\nabout losing email anymore.\n\n50\n00:02:29.518 --> 00:02:32.906\nRight, you can, [SOUND],\ndisaster averted, the system's up,\n\n51\n00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:35.439\npeople are able to get\ninto their email and work.\n\n52\n00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.989\nBut now, you can go back and restore all\nthe historical data and bring it back\n\n53\n00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.276\ninto the mailbox and so people are able\nto get in there and start to work.\n\n54\n00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:47.257\nSo, that's really the whole\npoint of a dial tone recovery,\n\n55\n00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:49.601\nis just to get people in\nthere as fast as you can.\n\n56\n00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:53.230\nIf email's a critical service for you,\nand you're worried about losing email,\n\n57\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.225\nwe need to get a mailbox database up and\ngoing, even an empty one, so\n\n58\n00:02:56.225 --> 00:02:59.486\nthat at least people can get in there and\nstart working with new stuff, and\n\n59\n00:02:59.486 --> 00:03:00.873\nthen we restore the old stuff.\n\n60\n00:03:00.873 --> 00:03:01.592\nAll right.\n\n61\n00:03:01.592 --> 00:03:03.921\nThe process, it's actually not that hard.\n\n62\n00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:06.108\nIt's a pretty easy process to go through.\n\n63\n00:03:06.108 --> 00:03:09.453\nBut there's some little confusing steps\nin there that I wanna highlight and\n\n64\n00:03:09.453 --> 00:03:11.924\nmake sure you guys understand\nwhy we do it a certain way.\n\n65\n00:03:11.924 --> 00:03:14.925\nBut the first part,\njust getting a dial-tone database up and\n\n66\n00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:16.032\ngoing is really easy.\n\n67\n00:03:16.032 --> 00:03:17.246\nLet me show you.\n\n68\n00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:20.792\nSo, here, I'm logged into my mailbox and\nI've taken a backup of my server.\n\n69\n00:03:20.792 --> 00:03:22.580\nI took the backup prior to the show.\n\n70\n00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.055\nAnd I sent a few emails.\n\n71\n00:03:24.055 --> 00:03:26.831\nI got an email that I sent\nmyself prior to the backup and\n\n72\n00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.313\nan email that I sent to\nmyself after the backup.\n\n73\n00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:30.961\nNow, why did I do that?\n\n74\n00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:35.369\nI did that because emails prior to the\nbackup are gonna be part of the backup.\n\n75\n00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:39.506\nEmails that were sent after the backup\nare gonna be in the transaction log, and\n\n76\n00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:43.095\nthey'll be in the database itself but\nthey won't be in the backup.\n\n77\n00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:46.226\nAnd so, when I restore, there's\na possibility I might be able to recover\n\n78\n00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.562\nthose transaction log files if it's\njust my database that's been damaged and\n\n79\n00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.741\nnot the transaction logs.\n\n80\n00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:51.683\nThere's a chance.\n\n81\n00:03:51.683 --> 00:03:53.703\nWith a dial tone recovery,\nit doesn't normally happen though.\n\n82\n00:03:53.703 --> 00:03:56.983\nSo, normally, what we'll end up losing\nthose emails that were afterwards\n\n83\n00:03:56.983 --> 00:03:58.790\nbecause they're not part of the backup.\n\n84\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.925\nWell, let's see how this works.\n\n85\n00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:03.426\nI'm going to go into my\nexchange admin center and\n\n86\n00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:07.712\nI'm just going to go down to servers and\ndatabases, and find my mailbox database.\n\n87\n00:04:07.712 --> 00:04:10.290\nAnd I'm gonna dismount it, now,\nmine actually says dismounted.\n\n88\n00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.602\nThere we go, now it's mounted.\n\n89\n00:04:11.602 --> 00:04:14.212\n[LAUGH] So, I'm gonna go ahead and\ndismount mine and take it offline.\n\n90\n00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:17.459\nAnd what I'm gonna do is, I'm just\ngonna go and rename that database file.\n\n91\n00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.313\nI'm gonna make it look like that database\nfile is gone, or we can just delete it.\n\n92\n00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:24.139\nI'll browse on the hard drive\nto where that database is.\n\n93\n00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.780\nSo, I'll just browse in here, and hunt\ndown where that database is stored, and\n\n94\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.356\nI'm gonna simulate a failure\nby deleting the database file.\n\n95\n00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:35.607\nOkay, so, here's that mailbox\ndatabase file right here.\n\n96\n00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:36.656\nI'm just gonna delete it.\n\n97\n00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.947\nNow, you can't delete it while\nthe database is mounted,\n\n98\n00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:40.133\nthat's why I dismounted it.\n\n99\n00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:40.992\nBut now it's gone.\n\n100\n00:04:40.992 --> 00:04:41.955\nOkay.\n\n101\n00:04:41.955 --> 00:04:44.883\nSo, now that the database is gone,\nI've got a failure.\n\n102\n00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:48.381\nIf a user tries to log in right now,\nwhat are they going to get?\n\n103\n00:04:48.381 --> 00:04:51.050\nWell, let me refresh this screen and\nwe'll see.\n\n104\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.242\nI'm trying to log into my mailbox and\nI get, something went wrong,\n\n105\n00:04:54.242 --> 00:04:56.260\nwe can't get that information right now.\n\n106\n00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.942\nExchange isn't able to access my mailbox.\n\n107\n00:04:57.942 --> 00:05:00.076\nThe database is offline.\n\n108\n00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:03.806\nAll right, if I go back to my\ndatabase screen, and I refresh it,\n\n109\n00:05:03.806 --> 00:05:06.793\nhere's my database,\nit shows it's dismounted.\n\n110\n00:05:06.793 --> 00:05:08.901\nIt doesn't know there's a problem yet.\n\n111\n00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:10.876\nIt knows the database is dismounted, but\n\n112\n00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:13.201\nit doesn't know the database\nis actually gone.\n\n113\n00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:17.564\nIt's not until I remount it that it's\ngonna notice there's a true problem.\n\n114\n00:05:17.564 --> 00:05:21.174\nAnd when I go to mount it, it's gonna say,\noh, sure, I'll say yes, and\n\n115\n00:05:21.174 --> 00:05:25.282\nnow it's gonna go to mount it, and it's\ngonna realize the database isn't there.\n\n116\n00:05:25.282 --> 00:05:26.084\nIt's missing.\n\n117\n00:05:26.084 --> 00:05:28.929\nThe EDB file is gone, okay?\n\n118\n00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:33.253\nAnd when it's gone,\nit now gives me two choices, right?\n\n119\n00:05:33.253 --> 00:05:36.014\nChoice number one,\ndon't do anything, just give up.\n\n120\n00:05:36.014 --> 00:05:40.261\nI can hit cancel here and it'll leave\nthe database off, and I can go and\n\n121\n00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:42.071\ndo a restore, or I can hit OK.\n\n122\n00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:45.926\nIf I hit OK,\nit's gonna create an empty database.\n\n123\n00:05:45.926 --> 00:05:47.563\nIt's gonna create a dial tone database.\n\n124\n00:05:47.563 --> 00:05:51.984\nIt'll recreate that EDB file for\nme, and get a database in there.\n\n125\n00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:55.858\nAnd once that happens, users will be able\nto get back into their mailbox, right?\n\n126\n00:05:55.858 --> 00:05:57.848\nSo, if I say okay to that,\nthat's what it's gonna do.\n\n127\n00:05:57.848 --> 00:05:59.162\nIt's gonna go and try and create one.\n\n128\n00:05:59.162 --> 00:06:02.153\nNow, when it tried to create one,\nit looked, and\n\n129\n00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:05.096\nit saw those transaction log files,\nall right?\n\n130\n00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:08.437\nIt hit those transaction log files and\nthat caused a problem.\n\n131\n00:06:08.437 --> 00:06:10.058\nSo, when we do a dial tone,\n\n132\n00:06:10.058 --> 00:06:14.365\nit's typically not going to roll\nforward those transaction log files.\n\n133\n00:06:14.365 --> 00:06:17.304\nSo, if I'm gonna get this in place,\nI'm gonna need to go in there and\n\n134\n00:06:17.304 --> 00:06:19.293\nclear those out to be able\nto get it put back in.\n\n135\n00:06:19.293 --> 00:06:21.853\nSo, here, it's just warning me\nthat it's not able to do that.\n\n136\n00:06:21.853 --> 00:06:25.717\nAnd I can just jump back to my files, and\nif I want to try some other way to recover\n\n137\n00:06:25.717 --> 00:06:29.936\nthese or whatever, I can always take them,\nand just move them off to another folder,\n\n138\n00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:33.014\nbut the odds are, I'm not gonna\nbe able to recover this data.\n\n139\n00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:36.058\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\ntake these anyway, and\n\n140\n00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:38.099\nI'll move them off to my C drive.\n\n141\n00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:42.589\nAnd I'll just put them in like some kind\nof temp folder just so I've got them, and\n\n142\n00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:45.912\nmaybe I can attempt some kind\nof recovery of those later on.\n\n143\n00:06:45.912 --> 00:06:48.181\nBut for right now,\nI'm gonna have to rely on my own backups.\n\n144\n00:06:48.181 --> 00:06:50.552\nSo, now that those files\nare out of the way,\n\n145\n00:06:50.552 --> 00:06:54.464\nif I go back to my database directory,\nif I browse all the way into there,\n\n146\n00:06:54.464 --> 00:06:56.930\nI should have saved the path,\nbut I didn't.\n\n147\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.693\nSo, we'll browse the long journey here\nback into where that database is.\n\n148\n00:07:00.693 --> 00:07:02.572\nI'll see if that folder\nis basically empty.\n\n149\n00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:05.531\nThere's a little GUID file here,\nit uses for some journaling.\n\n150\n00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:08.199\nIt, actually, won't let me remove that,\nso I'll leave that be.\n\n151\n00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.212\nNow, when I go through and try and\nremount it ,it's gonna try and mount.\n\n152\n00:07:12.212 --> 00:07:13.954\nIt's gonna see the database is missing.\n\n153\n00:07:13.954 --> 00:07:17.074\nIt's gonna offer to create the dial\ntone database and when it does,\n\n154\n00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:20.703\nit'll have an empty database with nice,\nnew, empty transaction log files.\n\n155\n00:07:20.703 --> 00:07:21.944\nSo, there we go.\n\n156\n00:07:21.944 --> 00:07:23.686\nLet it do that and then it'll be up.\n\n157\n00:07:23.686 --> 00:07:25.579\nNow, when it's up, when users log in,\n\n158\n00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:28.698\nyour client access server looks\nat the active directory and says,\n\n159\n00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:32.841\nhey, where's this person's mailbox, and\nit'll point them to this mailbox server.\n\n160\n00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:35.552\nAnd it'll come to the mailbox and\nit'll see that it's empty.\n\n161\n00:07:35.552 --> 00:07:38.512\nAnd it'll just assume it's a new user,\nlike hey, this is somebody new.\n\n162\n00:07:38.512 --> 00:07:41.863\nAnd so, it'll be like somebody\nlogging in for the first time.\n\n163\n00:07:41.863 --> 00:07:45.152\nBut they've got all their email addresses,\nall their mailbox rules.\n\n164\n00:07:45.152 --> 00:07:47.185\nAll the stuff that they\nhad before is still there.\n\n165\n00:07:47.185 --> 00:07:48.661\nIt's just the email that are missing.\n\n166\n00:07:48.661 --> 00:07:51.238\nAnd if they have a folder hierarchy,\nthose will be missing too.\n\n167\n00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:54.245\nSo, that stuff is part of\nthe mailbox database itself.\n\n168\n00:07:54.245 --> 00:07:57.830\nBut the fact that the mailbox exists is\nactually stored in the active directory\n\n169\n00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.670\nand so that's staying,\ntheir configuration.\n\n170\n00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:05.180\nSo now that database is mounted and\nif I browse back to that database path,\n\n171\n00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.604\nwhich I really should have saved that.\n\n172\n00:08:07.604 --> 00:08:10.207\n[LAUGH] But\nif we browse back to the database path,\n\n173\n00:08:10.207 --> 00:08:14.589\nwe'll see where it's created a nice new\nempty database in new transaction logs,\n\n174\n00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:17.653\nright, so it's all right there and\nit's new and shiny.\n\n175\n00:08:17.653 --> 00:08:21.044\nAnd as a user,\nif I go to login now, right,\n\n176\n00:08:21.044 --> 00:08:25.286\nso I'll come in here and\ntry and get logged in to OWA and\n\n177\n00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:30.430\nwhen we get in now,\nit's not gonna give me an error this time.\n\n178\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.330\nThis time it succeeds and\nhere I am but my mailbox is empty.\n\n179\n00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.630\nI'm missing data.\n\n180\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.340\nBut that's not the point,\nthe point is that my mailbox is working.\n\n181\n00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.210\nAnd if I get any new emails, so\nsomebody writes an email to me and\n\n182\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.120\nthat doesn't seem to be happy with\nmy name, let's try that again.\n\n183\n00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.670\nLet's see if it finds me.\n\n184\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.610\nSo, it's gonna let me draft that email.\n\n185\n00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.520\nI can do a test email, this is a test.\n\n186\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.356\nWe'll fire that off and this is all\nhappening in this new empty database.\n\n187\n00:09:00.356 --> 00:09:03.731\nSo now my users are at least able\nto send and receive email and\n\n188\n00:09:03.731 --> 00:09:05.359\nthey're in there, right.\n\n189\n00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:08.791\nSo now I can tell people, hey, it's safe\nto get back into your mailboxes, but\n\n190\n00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:12.015\nyou're gonna be missing all your old\nemail, we'll get that back to you,\n\n191\n00:09:12.015 --> 00:09:12.535\nall right.\n\n192\n00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:15.570\nSo now we're back up and\nonline as fast as we can.\n\n193\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.600\nNow technically,\nthe dial tone part of this is done.\n\n194\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.110\nWe've got the dial tone database up,\nwe're in there and we're running.\n\n195\n00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.720\nBut now comes our work.\n\n196\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.640\nAs an admin, we've gotta get in and\nrestore the old data.\n\n197\n00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.370\nNow, here's the challenge, we've actually\ngot two databases at this point.\n\n198\n00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.480\nBecause we were in a hurry,\nwe brought this one up and\n\n199\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.830\nthis is now accumulating new email.\n\n200\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.620\nMeanwhile, I've got my database back up.\n\n201\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.860\nIf I just restore it on top of this,\nI'm gonna lose all my new email.\n\n202\n00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.430\nSo what I've gotta do is restore\nto what's called a recovery group.\n\n203\n00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.620\nA recovery group is like\na special database that\n\n204\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.271\nis allowed to have duplicate mailboxes,\n\n205\n00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:55.260\nmailboxes that already exist in another\ndatabase, but not bring them online.\n\n206\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.970\nSo you use a recovery group to restore\nyour data to it and then pull it off and\n\n207\n00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.520\nmove it into another database.\n\n208\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.780\nSo that's what we're\ngonna have to do here,\n\n209\n00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.000\nwe're gonna have to restore all of\nour old data to a recovery group and\n\n210\n00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.640\nthen from there, move it back\ninto the dial tone, all right?\n\n211\n00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.340\nSo that's gonna be my next step and\nI still haven't received my email,\n\n212\n00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.960\nsometimes it can take a little while for\n\n213\n00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.010\nthe transport services to get updated\nto be able to reflect the new database.\n\n214\n00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.550\nBut my new email will show up here\nshortly, I'm not gonna wait for it though.\n\n215\n00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.700\nIn the meantime,\nI need to get this other restore going, so\n\n216\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.650\nI'm gonna jump in and do that.\n\n217\n00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.620\nNow, unfortunately there is not\na great way to do this from the GUI.\n\n218\n00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.870\nSo, I'm gonna have to jump down\nto my PowerShell to get in and\n\n219\n00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.630\nactually do this restore and\nget everything kind of put back in place.\n\n220\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:43.440\nNow, the biggest negative of doing\nthis is we have to have the path for\n\n221\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.710\nwhere the backup resides to be able\nto reach in and recover that data and\n\n222\n00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.260\nstuff and\nthe path can get really kind of messy.\n\n223\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.820\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n224\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.360\nFirst off, I need to restore the database,\n\n225\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.300\nso I'm gonna jump into my\nWindows Server Backup,\n\n226\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.540\nwhich you can go into your Server Manager\n> Tools > Windows Server Backup, right?\n\n227\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.490\nThat's what I did my backup in, if you\nused third party software, you'd recover\n\n228\n00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:09.230\nwith it, but I used Windows Server Backup\nand I'm gonna go and do a recover.\n\n229\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.720\nAnd when I recover, normally you wanna\nrecover right on top of the server to\n\n230\n00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.460\nbring it back online, but in my case,\nI wanna recover to an alternate location.\n\n231\n00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.120\nSo as we go to start restoring this,\nI'm gonna move forward,\n\n232\n00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.870\nI'll say that I'm restoring\nan application and\n\n233\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.009\nmy application is gonna\nbe Microsoft Exchange.\n\n234\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.840\nAnd then, I'm gonna recover to\na different location, right?\n\n235\n00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.070\nSo I'm just gonna make a new\nfolder on my hard drive and\n\n236\n00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.820\nthat way I can recover to that.\n\n237\n00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.113\nSo I'll just create a folder\nhere called RecoveryDB.\n\n238\n00:11:41.113 --> 00:11:45.370\nAll right, so that's where I'm gonna place\nmy back up and we'll let that recover.\n\n239\n00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.560\nSo I'm leaving the dial tone database\nalone cuz it's getting new email,\n\n240\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.840\nI don't wanna lose that and I'm restoring\nto another location, all right?\n\n241\n00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.262\nThat recovery should happen pretty quick,\nit's already done, right.\n\n242\n00:11:55.262 --> 00:11:58.722\nIt happens quick for me cuz my\ndatabase is very small, it's 270 megs.\n\n243\n00:11:58.722 --> 00:12:00.545\nYour database might be a terabyte in size.\n\n244\n00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:02.262\nThis recovery could take a while, right?\n\n245\n00:12:02.262 --> 00:12:03.763\nIf it was really short,\nif it was that short,\n\n246\n00:12:03.763 --> 00:12:05.950\nI wouldn't have created a dial\ntone database in the first place.\n\n247\n00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.120\nI would have just recovered\nstraight to it, right?\n\n248\n00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.290\nIf your database is small enough,\njust skip the dial tone.\n\n249\n00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.660\nJust tell your users, hey,\nI need an hour to recover the database,\n\n250\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.210\nyou restore it and you're done.\n\n251\n00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:19.787\nBut if you're database is so large, it's\ngonna take 6 hours, 12, 24 hours, right?\n\n252\n00:12:19.787 --> 00:12:22.490\nYou don't want your users to have to wait\nfor that, you bring up the dial tone.\n\n253\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.110\nSo don't use a dial tone\nif you don't have to.\n\n254\n00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.320\nIt's only if you're in a hurry,\n\n255\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.430\nif you need that database up\nas fast as you can, right?\n\n256\n00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.087\nSo here, I've restored mine and\nif I browse to the hard drive,\n\n257\n00:12:33.087 --> 00:12:34.677\nI can go to C > RecoveryDB.\n\n258\n00:12:34.677 --> 00:12:38.740\nAnd then here's where it gets a little\nquirky because when it recovers it,\n\n259\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.543\nit's got a GUID that's tied to\nthe system and that's first folder and\n\n260\n00:12:42.543 --> 00:12:44.496\nthen it mimics the file hierarchy.\n\n261\n00:12:44.496 --> 00:12:48.536\nAnd so I have C_ cuz you can't\nhave a colon in a file name.\n\n262\n00:12:48.536 --> 00:12:53.107\nAnd then, we've got Program Files >\nMicrosoft > Exchange Server > V15 >\n\n263\n00:12:53.107 --> 00:12:55.330\nMailbox > Mailbox Database.\n\n264\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.750\nAnd then here's the mailbox database\nrecovered to this alternate\n\n265\n00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.440\nlocation, okay.\n\n266\n00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.350\nSo, that's a nice long path.\n\n267\n00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.700\nAnd the reason I browsed to it in\nthe GUI is cuz I can come in here and\n\n268\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.430\njust copy that and that'll save\nme a little bit of time later.\n\n269\n00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.720\nSo, I've got that path now to\nbe able to use in my commands.\n\n270\n00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.170\nOkay, so if you stored our recovery\ndata to a different folder and\n\n271\n00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.390\nnow we need to get that recovery\ndata into people's mailboxes.\n\n272\n00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.720\nThis is were things get a little weird,\nall right.\n\n273\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.900\nWe could mount that recovery database.\n\n274\n00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.770\nYou can bring it online and then we could\ndo mailbox restore requests to restore\n\n275\n00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.850\nthat data into our dial tone database and\nthen we're back up and running.\n\n276\n00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.460\nHere's the problem though, your dial tone\ndatabase is probably very, very small and\n\n277\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.110\nyour recovery database is\nprobably very large, right?\n\n278\n00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:43.970\nYour dial tone database only has email in\nit, that's what's happened since the dial\n\n279\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.600\ntone database came live, right, which\nhopefully is a very short period of time.\n\n280\n00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.980\nYour recovery database has\nemail way back in history,\n\n281\n00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.380\nright, it's got a ton of\ninformation in there.\n\n282\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:58.260\nSo doing the mailbox move requests\ncan take a long time, right.\n\n283\n00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.741\nIf you do that, if you do\na mailbox move request and move or\n\n284\n00:14:00.741 --> 00:14:03.979\nmerge the mailboxes from the recovery\ngroup into the dial tone database.\n\n285\n00:14:03.979 --> 00:14:07.582\nUsers can stay in the database and they\njust start to magically see their email\n\n286\n00:14:07.582 --> 00:14:12.320\nreappearing, it's kind of neat, it's\nneat to watch, but it takes a long time.\n\n287\n00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.100\nSo, a better option is to schedule\na down time with your users.\n\n288\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.410\nYour users are in their email now,\nthey're able to send and receive email, so\n\n289\n00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.800\nyou say, okay guys, tonight at 1 AM, we're\ngonna be taking the mail server offline.\n\n290\n00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.040\nOkay and it's only gonna be offline for\na few moments.\n\n291\n00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.540\nYou don't have to it at 1 AM,\nyou could do it at 1PM, whenever.\n\n292\n00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.580\nYou just say look, I need to take the\nmailbox server offline for a few minutes.\n\n293\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.560\nAnd while it's offline,\nyou can swap the recovery database and\n\n294\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.120\nthe dial tone database.\n\n295\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.240\nAnd when you swap it, you can bring it\nback online and now users can get in and\n\n296\n00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.000\nthey'll have all their historical email,\nbut they won't have the stuff from\n\n297\n00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.400\nthe dial tone,\nthey'll be missing the new stuff, right?\n\n298\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.440\nBut the new stuff is very small and so\nnow we can do a mailbox merger quest and\n\n299\n00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.740\nit's only copying a little bit of data and\nit happens much faster.\n\n300\n00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:03.500\nSo, if speed is of the essence,\nwe need to do a database swap.\n\n301\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.780\nIf speed is not of the essence, we've got\nall the time in the world, then you can\n\n302\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.410\njust mount that recovery database and\nthen merge the data right over.\n\n303\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.350\nAll right, so you'll skip the swap step.\n\n304\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.470\nBut for me, I'm concerned about speed,\nso I'm gonna do the swap.\n\n305\n00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.990\nSo I reach out to my users and\nI say, look,\n\n306\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.330\nI know it's been a rough day, I know that\nyou guys have been out of your email and\n\n307\n00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.660\nI feel bad about that but\nI need to take it offline.\n\n308\n00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.760\nGive me five minutes, I'll take it\noffline and then we'll bring it back and\n\n309\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.310\nwhen it comes back online,\nthen we'll be able to get in it and\n\n310\n00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.480\nstart to take care of things.\n\n311\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.050\nSo that's kind of where\nwe're at right here.\n\n312\n00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.836\nSo I'm gonna take this and\ndo a database swap.\n\n313\n00:15:38.836 --> 00:15:42.990\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna jump\nback to my Exchange Admin Center and\n\n314\n00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.750\nI'm gonna take this database, this dial\ntone database and I'm gonna dismount it.\n\n315\n00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:52.290\nOkay, so I'm gonna dismount that database.\n\n316\n00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:57.562\nThen, once it's dismounted,\nI'm gonna go to my C drive here,\n\n317\n00:15:57.562 --> 00:16:01.410\nand I need to make\na copy of that database.\n\n318\n00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.940\nI'm gonna browse on my C drive\ninto the actual live database,\n\n319\n00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.210\nwhat's really the dial tone.\n\n320\n00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:12.610\nWhen I browse in here and find it, here it\nis, I'm just gonna copy all these files.\n\n321\n00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.620\nI'm gonna make a safe\nplace on my hard drive.\n\n322\n00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.500\nI'm just gonna browse here to my C\ndrive and create a new folder and\n\n323\n00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.372\nI'll call this one DialTone and\nI'm gonna paste that data in here.\n\n324\n00:16:24.372 --> 00:16:29.230\nThis is all the user's email\nthat's come in since I brought\n\n325\n00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.500\nthe dial tone database online, it's all\nstored right here in this database.\n\n326\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.610\nThis is where it starts to get\na little scary, I'm gonna go in and\n\n327\n00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.980\ndelete the dial tone database.\n\n328\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.070\nThis is the live folder now and\nI'm gonna go in and\n\n329\n00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.840\njust delete that out of there and\nwhen I delete it,\n\n330\n00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.900\nnow the database is gone and\nI can jump back to what I restored.\n\n331\n00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.050\nThis is what I've restored\nfrom that backup,\n\n332\n00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.830\nthis is where all my historical data is.\n\n333\n00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.820\nThis is the big database.\n\n334\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.930\nI can take this and I can just copy it and\nput it right back in here.\n\n335\n00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.480\nExchange databases are actually portable.\n\n336\n00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.060\nIn other words, if you have the EDB and\nall its associated transaction logs,\n\n337\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.950\nyou can copy it to any exchange server and\nmount it and bring it online.\n\n338\n00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.920\nThey don't truly care\nwhat server they run on,\n\n339\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.420\nthey just need to run on\na valid exchange server.\n\n340\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.000\nYou can just copy that\ndatabase right over.\n\n341\n00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.340\nI've got the database and\n\n342\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:30.080\nits transaction log files, and\nnow if I mount that database and\n\n343\n00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.260\nbring it back online, it's got all\nthe historical data up to that backup.\n\n344\n00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.480\nI can jump back here and\nI can mount this database\n\n345\n00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.610\nand now it'll be online with\nall the historical data.\n\n346\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.870\nNow, I just have that dial tone database\nthat has the smaller subset of data that\n\n347\n00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.640\ncame in since I brought it back online and\nI need to merge that.\n\n348\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.360\nIf I'm not worried about time, I can\nskip this step, skip the swapping and\n\n349\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.960\nthen just go straight into to\nmerging the recovery database.\n\n350\n00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.370\nBut in my case, I'm worried about time,\nI want this to be fast.\n\n351\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.148\nNow it's mounted and if a user logs in,\n\n352\n00:18:06.148 --> 00:18:11.080\nwe'll take me, see how I did that\ntest email that came through earlier?\n\n353\n00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.240\nThat was in my dial tone database but\n\n354\n00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.440\nif I refresh my mailbox now,\nI've got my historical data.\n\n355\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.140\nEmail sent prior to backup,\nit's there but that\n\n356\n00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.700\ntest email I sent during the dial tone is\ngone because I moved that database off.\n\n357\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.880\nNow I just need to merge that in and\nwe're done but\n\n358\n00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.480\nI can reach out to my users right now and\nsay hey,\n\n359\n00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.550\nguys you can get back into your mailbox\nand you can send and receive email now.\n\n360\n00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.670\nYou've got all your historical data but\nyour dial tone stuff is missing,\n\n361\n00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:36.725\nI'm restoring that right now.\n\n362\n00:18:36.725 --> 00:18:41.380\nA real short down time and it's down on\nour schedule instead of somebody else's.\n\n363\n00:18:42.415 --> 00:18:46.470\nNow I just need to jump in\nto restore that dial tone.\n\n364\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.782\nThis is where things do get\na little bit difficult,\n\n365\n00:18:48.782 --> 00:18:50.900\nI've got to do it from the PowerShell.\n\n366\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.980\nI'm gonna jump into my Exchange Management\nShell, and I'm gonna get this set up.\n\n367\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.170\nIn the Exchange Management Shell,\nI need to mount the recovery database, and\n\n368\n00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.810\nthen I need to merge the emails in, and so\n\n369\n00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:08.454\nthat process is a little bit\ntough in a way, I guess.\n\n370\n00:19:08.454 --> 00:19:12.300\n[LAUGH] What I need to do is just run\nthrough and get all these people merged.\n\n371\n00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.070\nThe steps basically go like this.\n\n372\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.120\nFirst off, I need to mount that recovery\ndatabase, so I'm going to go ahead and\n\n373\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.180\ndo that and get that one tied in.\n\n374\n00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.270\nI copied that dial tone database off\nthe c:/dialtone, what I need to do now\n\n375\n00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.560\nis create a recovery database and\npoint it at that data to bring it online.\n\n376\n00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.320\nThe way we do that is with the new\ndash mailbox database command.\n\n377\n00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.650\nNow that'll normally create a live mailbox\ndatabase but I'm gonna duplicate email\n\n378\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.410\nmailboxes in the live one and this\nrecovery one, so I need to make sure say\n\n379\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.640\ndash recovery, so it knows that it's\nnot a true live mailbox database.\n\n380\n00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.070\nNo users will be allowed to access this\nand no new email is going to go into it.\n\n381\n00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.535\nThat dash recovery is kind of important.\n\n382\n00:19:50.535 --> 00:19:53.650\nWe give it a name and\nI'll just call mine recovery db,\n\n383\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.880\nyou can call it whatever you want just so\nyou can remember the name of it.\n\n384\n00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.982\nWe're only going to have this temporarily,\nwe'll delete this when we're done.\n\n385\n00:19:59.982 --> 00:20:05.070\nJust gonna whip that up, then we need\nto tell it where to find its files.\n\n386\n00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:10.990\nThere's the EDB file path which I'm\ngonna point to c:\\DialTone\\ there,\n\n387\n00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.450\nthe mailbox database file name.\n\n388\n00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:18.990\nLastly, the log file path which for me is\nc:\\DialTone, that's where I copied that.\n\n389\n00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.490\nLast, I need to tell it what server\nI want to restore to and in my case,\n\n390\n00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.890\nI'm just gonna restore to this server,\n\n391\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.950\nwhich is lab-mailbox01 and\nthat's going to go and define that.\n\n392\n00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.290\nIt's gonna create that\nnew recovery database and\n\n393\n00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:33.890\nit's gonna be ready to go live.\n\n394\n00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.360\nNow, it's not actually gonna go live.\n\n395\n00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.780\nSee all these warnings I'm getting?\n\n396\n00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.080\nIt's warning me that hey,\nthere's existing data there.\n\n397\n00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.270\nIt might not have been cleanly shut down.\n\n398\n00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.940\nNow, I know I cleanly shut it down.\n\n399\n00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.470\nI dismounted that database, and\n\n400\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.500\nthen I copied it but\nthe system doesn't know that.\n\n401\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.020\nIt doesn't know that I\ndid it the right way.\n\n402\n00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.960\nWe need to make sure that it understands\nthat and it's very easy to do.\n\n403\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.550\nYou'd do this anyway if it\nwasn't cleanly shut down,\n\n404\n00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.670\nif you had a potentially damaged database,\n\n405\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.740\nwe just need to do a little maintenance\non it to cleanly shut it down.\n\n406\n00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.500\nI'll show you how that works.\n\n407\n00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.890\nIf I get into the folder where\nI backed up that data, so\n\n408\n00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.630\nhere's where that database is residing,\nright here.\n\n409\n00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:15.100\nI can use the ESEutil,\nthat's the exchange engine, and\n\n410\n00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.470\nwe can use this utility to parse through\nexchange databases and clean them up.\n\n411\n00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:25.730\nI'm gonna use that ESEutil and I'm gonna\ntell it to replay transaction logs,\n\n412\n00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:29.710\nthe E00 and\nthis is based on the database name.\n\n413\n00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:30.660\nSee my files up here?\n\n414\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.510\nThey start with E00.\n\n415\n00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.228\nIf this was the second, or third, or\nfourth database, they'd be E01, or\n\n416\n00:21:35.228 --> 00:21:35.812\nwhatever.\n\n417\n00:21:35.812 --> 00:21:38.100\nIt's looking at\nthe transaction log files for\n\n418\n00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.480\nany transaction that was 100% complete,\nand it's going to apply them.\n\n419\n00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.028\nAny transaction that wasn't 100% complete,\n\n420\n00:21:45.028 --> 00:21:48.652\nit's gonna roll back and that'll\nmake sure I've got a clean database.\n\n421\n00:21:48.652 --> 00:21:53.715\nI'm telling it those transaction log\nfiles, the prefix of each file and\n\n422\n00:21:53.715 --> 00:21:58.446\nthen lastly, I just need to tell it\nthat I need to rebuild indexes and\n\n423\n00:21:58.446 --> 00:22:02.430\ndefragment and it's gonna go through and\nclean that up.\n\n424\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:07.062\nNow it should happen pretty quickly in\nmine, it's just performing that soft\n\n425\n00:22:07.062 --> 00:22:11.349\nrecovery, and because I did a clean\nshutdown, it's almost instant.\n\n426\n00:22:11.349 --> 00:22:14.015\nIf it wasn't a clean shut down,\na little status bar appears and\n\n427\n00:22:14.015 --> 00:22:16.697\nit churns through and\ngets that database cleaned up and ready.\n\n428\n00:22:16.697 --> 00:22:19.564\nIf you're dial tone database is\nreally small, it's only new email, so\n\n429\n00:22:19.564 --> 00:22:21.262\nthis should happen really, really fast.\n\n430\n00:22:21.262 --> 00:22:24.535\nIf you're doing this on a full database,\nit can take ten minutes sometimes while it\n\n431\n00:22:24.535 --> 00:22:26.756\nchurns through the database and\ncleans everything up.\n\n432\n00:22:26.756 --> 00:22:30.576\nEspecially, if a backup hasn't been run\nin a while because you have a lot of\n\n433\n00:22:30.576 --> 00:22:31.860\ntransaction log files.\n\n434\n00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.500\nI've got that one set, it's ready,\nit's clean, it's happy.\n\n435\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.170\nI should be able to bring it online\nwith mount dash database and\n\n436\n00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:44.350\nthen specify the name of that database,\nand we'll see if it comes online.\n\n437\n00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.060\nIf I get an error here, then my database\nis corrupt and that shouldn't happen.\n\n438\n00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.560\nOnce this is done,\nI've got my live database.\n\n439\n00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.030\nMy live database,\nthe users are in it right now.\n\n440\n00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.655\nIt's got all the historical data and\n\n441\n00:22:54.655 --> 00:22:58.240\nit's got new stuff now but\nit's missing in the dial tone stuff.\n\n442\n00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.930\nThe dial tone stuff is in\nthe now in the recovery db.\n\n443\n00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.850\nThe last thing that I need to do is to\nget the user email out of the recovery\n\n444\n00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:05.740\ndatabase and\n\n445\n00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.470\nmerge it into their live mailbox and\nthat's done with some PowerShell commands.\n\n446\n00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:14.540\nThe reason we do it with PowerShell, is\nwe could do it one by one in the EAC but\n\n447\n00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.935\nif you've got 10,000 users,\nyou don't wanna do that.\n\n448\n00:23:16.935 --> 00:23:18.170\nPowerShell can knock it out real fast.\n\n449\n00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:18.860\nLet me show you how.\n\n450\n00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.365\nWe know we can use get dash mailbox to\npull up a list of all the mailboxes that\n\n451\n00:23:23.365 --> 00:23:26.577\nwe have on the server and we can point\nit at the recovery database to get all\n\n452\n00:23:26.577 --> 00:23:29.227\nthe mailboxes in the recovery database,\ntoo, if we want.\n\n453\n00:23:29.227 --> 00:23:33.267\nBut, what we can do is we can just get\ndash mailbox to give us a list of users\n\n454\n00:23:33.267 --> 00:23:37.379\nand we can pipe that into the mailbox\nmerge request to restore that data and\n\n455\n00:23:37.379 --> 00:23:38.960\nget us back online.\n\n456\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.171\nWe can do it with just\na couple of quick commands.\n\n457\n00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:46.377\nFirst off, I'm gonna create\na variable called mailboxes and\n\n458\n00:23:46.377 --> 00:23:49.890\nI'm gonna set it equal to get-mailbox.\n\n459\n00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.897\nI only have one database, so\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n460\n00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:53.797\nBut if you have more than one database,\n\n461\n00:23:53.797 --> 00:23:56.043\nyou'll want to make\nsure you say -Database,\n\n462\n00:23:56.043 --> 00:23:59.861\nand then whatever the name of the database\nis, and this is your live database.\n\n463\n00:23:59.861 --> 00:24:03.241\nNow my live database has that obnoxious\nname that I copied earlier, so\n\n464\n00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:05.950\nI'm just going to paste that one in.\n\n465\n00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:06.990\nThere we go.\n\n466\n00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:10.460\nAnd so I'm basically getting a list of\nall the mailboxes in that database.\n\n467\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.220\nAnd storing them in a variable,\nall right, so that runs.\n\n468\n00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.290\nIf I were to echo that variable,\nyou can see what's in there,\n\n469\n00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.160\nit's just the list of mailboxes.\n\n470\n00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:18.970\nOkay?\n\n471\n00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:23.830\nThen, I can use that variable in my next\ncommand, to go through and do a merge for\n\n472\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.960\nevery person whose mailbox is in there,\nand the command goes like this.\n\n473\n00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:33.330\nBasically, we, we run $mailboxes\nto generate that list and\n\n474\n00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:38.530\nthen we pipe that into the new\nmailbox restore request.\n\n475\n00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.170\nThe problem is, cuz you might ask\nwhy don't I just run get-mailbox and\n\n476\n00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.230\npipe that in,\n\n477\n00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:48.650\nthe problem is treated as one big entity\nwhen you run get-mailbox and pipe it.\n\n478\n00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:51.870\nI need it to run this command once for\nevery single user.\n\n479\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.080\nSo I need to take action for\neach individual step.\n\n480\n00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.230\nIn the Linux world we have the XR\ncommand that would knock this out.\n\n481\n00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.570\nIn Powershell we have to do it through\nsome creative bracketing which we'll\n\n482\n00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:02.220\nsee right here.\n\n483\n00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:07.130\nSo instead of just piping this right\nin to the new mailbox restore request\n\n484\n00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:12.060\nI'm gonna do ${ and\nthat's letting it know that I'm gonna be\n\n485\n00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.110\nrunning this entity basically like\nonce over and over and over again.\n\n486\n00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.460\nAnd then in there I'll do\nthe new-mailboxRestoreRequest, not repair,\n\n487\n00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:26.014\nrestore request and\nI'll tell it the -sourcestoremailbox,\n\n488\n00:25:26.014 --> 00:25:30.288\nso where I'm getting my data from and\nthe source database, right.\n\n489\n00:25:30.288 --> 00:25:35.090\nSo the sourcestoremailbox, I can get that\nright from my other command output and so\n\n490\n00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.980\nwe can just use $_, that means, look\nto the output from this first command,\n\n491\n00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.820\nand I'm gonna look for\na particular entity inside of there.\n\n492\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:50.410\nI'm looking for ExchangeGuid and\nthen I can specify the source database.\n\n493\n00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.860\nAnd the source database is\ngonna be the RecoveryDB.\n\n494\n00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.540\nThat's where we're actually gonna get\nthis data from, the recovery database.\n\n495\n00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.154\nAnd from there we can tell\nit the -targetMailbox.\n\n496\n00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.650\nWhich it's gonna get right\nfrom the other command.\n\n497\n00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:12.889\nAnd then lastly, we can tell it,\nthis last little bit.\n\n498\n00:26:12.889 --> 00:26:14.927\nNow this last little bit,\nyou'll see it all over the internet,\n\n499\n00:26:14.927 --> 00:26:15.921\nnot a lot of people explain it.\n\n500\n00:26:15.921 --> 00:26:20.748\nThey'll tell you that you\nneed to do a -skipMerging for\n\n501\n00:26:20.748 --> 00:26:24.557\nthe StorageProviderForSource like that.\n\n502\n00:26:24.557 --> 00:26:27.280\nNow, that's a weird command.\n\n503\n00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.330\nWhat's that all about?\n\n504\n00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:32.667\nWell there's actually a bug in Exchange\n2013, so if you're watching this show\n\n505\n00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:35.860\nright now, you've got a live\ninstall of Exchange 2013.\n\n506\n00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.056\nYou have this bug.\n\n507\n00:26:37.056 --> 00:26:40.830\nWhere the merge request'll fail when\nit tries to restore the mailbox\n\n508\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.090\nbecause the storage provider,\nit stores some data for\n\n509\n00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:46.960\nthat, that isn't the same if you\njust rebuilt your server, right?\n\n510\n00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.259\nSo we have to tell it to\nskip that set of values for\n\n511\n00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:52.080\nthe storage provider in order for\nthe restore to proceed.\n\n512\n00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.690\nIf I leave that off my restore will fail,\nright?\n\n513\n00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.532\nSo this is gonna make sure that happens.\n\n514\n00:26:56.532 --> 00:26:58.800\nNow that'll probably go away, so\n\n515\n00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.910\nif you're watching this show six\nmonths from now or whatever,\n\n516\n00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.210\nMicrosoft will probably have fixed that,\nbut it doesn't hurt to leave this in.\n\n517\n00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.937\nIt's just telling it,\nhey, when you restore,\n\n518\n00:27:06.937 --> 00:27:09.353\nthe storage provider might have\na slightly different identifier.\n\n519\n00:27:09.353 --> 00:27:12.920\nIf it has the same identifier,\nit runs just fine if you skip it.\n\n520\n00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.430\nSo it's pretty safe to leave that in\nthere, and that'll take care of it.\n\n521\n00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:20.570\nWe're taking that output from get-mailbox,\nand we're feeding it in\n\n522\n00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:25.650\na new-mailboxRestoreRequest, so it's\nrunning a restore for each of these users.\n\n523\n00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.530\nNow, when it does it this way,\nit's a merge, not a replace.\n\n524\n00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:33.680\nSo their live mailbox has all\ntheir historical data in it and\n\n525\n00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.860\nnow I'm just moving the dial tone stuff\nin to get them back up and running.\n\n526\n00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.890\nSo, when I run that assuming\nI don't have any typos which,\n\n527\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.490\nthat's a long command I could\nprobably have a typo in there.\n\n528\n00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:45.050\nIt's gonna run.\n\n529\n00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.010\nIt's gonna try and run for\neach individual user.\n\n530\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.240\nAll right now,\nI got some errors on mine and\n\n531\n00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.821\nat first I thought I had some typos but\nthese are some normal errors.\n\n532\n00:27:52.821 --> 00:27:55.210\n[LAUGH] I know, normal errors,\nthese are what we expect.\n\n533\n00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:55.990\nBut if you look at it,\n\n534\n00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.870\nit's basically telling me that some\nof the mailboxes don't exist, right?\n\n535\n00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.310\nSo it's telling me that this mailbox\nwith a GUID doesn't exist, and\n\n536\n00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.920\nthis other mailbox doesn't exist.\n\n537\n00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.750\nWhat's that all about?\n\n538\n00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:09.480\nWell each mailbox, each mailbox database\nhas certain mailboxes like these,\n\n539\n00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.650\nthe discovery search mailbox or\nit's got the health mailbox.\n\n540\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:18.220\nThose mailboxes are ones that\nreside on the system that\n\n541\n00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.130\nhave a different GUID on new installs.\n\n542\n00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.330\nSo when I created a new database their\nGUID changes so those weren't found.\n\n543\n00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.520\nFortunately, we don't care\nabout those mailboxes.\n\n544\n00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.540\nThe ones we care about are the ones\nthe users are tied to.\n\n545\n00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.399\nSo I see like, Don Pezet and\nJane Smith and if I scroll down here,\n\n546\n00:28:31.399 --> 00:28:33.273\nI can see those were queued up.\n\n547\n00:28:33.273 --> 00:28:34.000\nThere's Don Pezet.\n\n548\n00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.940\nThere's Jane Smith.\n\n549\n00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.050\nSo it is actually queuing those up and\ngetting them in place.\n\n550\n00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:38.600\nRight?\n\n551\n00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.760\nNow, you do wanna keep and\neye on these, though.\n\n552\n00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.590\nAnd when it does the mailbox merges, in\nthe background it's creating those merge\n\n553\n00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.680\nrequests, and we can go back and look\nat the merge requests that are running.\n\n554\n00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.555\nThis doesn't actually do the merge.\n\n555\n00:28:48.555 --> 00:28:50.308\nIt does the merge request, and so\n\n556\n00:28:50.308 --> 00:28:53.700\nin the background it's now added\nto a queue and it's gonna run.\n\n557\n00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.496\nAnd I can do a quick\nGet-mailboxRestoreRequest to see a list\n\n558\n00:28:58.496 --> 00:29:01.040\nany restores that are running.\n\n559\n00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.340\nI can see Jane Smith and\nDon Pezet are running right now.\n\n560\n00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.290\nActually they're not running.\n\n561\n00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:05.900\nThey're completed.\n\n562\n00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.490\nI can see they're already done.\n\n563\n00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:08.630\nRight?\nWe need to watch this,\n\n564\n00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.880\ncuz if you're restoring 10,000 users,\nyou'll want to watch and\n\n565\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.160\nmake sure everybody gets\nflagged as completed.\n\n566\n00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.550\nAnd you can do a filter\nto filter out completed,\n\n567\n00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:20.330\nthey'll say queued if they're waiting,\nand then completed when they're done.\n\n568\n00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.930\nSo I can see that this is done,\nand my mailbox, Jane's mailbox,\n\n569\n00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.970\nwe should be restored, and\nwe should be back in business, all right?\n\n570\n00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.562\nNow how can we tell?\n\n571\n00:29:27.562 --> 00:29:30.274\nWell, the end users can really tell,\nthey can log in and\n\n572\n00:29:30.274 --> 00:29:32.084\nat this point they should have both.\n\n573\n00:29:32.084 --> 00:29:36.413\nAll their historical mail and the mail\nthat was in the dial tone recovery should\n\n574\n00:29:36.413 --> 00:29:39.310\nall be present and\nthey should have that available.\n\n575\n00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:44.580\nSo if I go in here and\naccess OWA I'm gonna refresh my mailbox.\n\n576\n00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.510\nAnd when I refresh it here's\nmy email prior to the back up.\n\n577\n00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.250\nAnd here's my email from\nthe dial tone database.\n\n578\n00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.070\nAnd now it's all in one place.\n\n579\n00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.750\nAs a user, my mailbox is now whole again.\n\n580\n00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.570\nRight?\nSo I have all my mail back again.\n\n581\n00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:03.680\nNow this was a much more involved\nprocess than doing the standard restore\n\n582\n00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.300\nlike we did in the other episode.\n\n583\n00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:09.420\nAnd that's because here, we're subjecting\nourself to something that's more difficult\n\n584\n00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.340\nbecause we want our database\nto be back online faster.\n\n585\n00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.219\nSo if speed is of the essence,\nyou do it this way.\n\n586\n00:30:15.219 --> 00:30:18.184\nBut if you wanna do it thoroughly,\nnot make mistakes,\n\n587\n00:30:18.184 --> 00:30:20.126\nthe other way is certainly easier.\n\n588\n00:30:20.126 --> 00:30:21.883\nYou just have a longer\ndowntime the other way,\n\n589\n00:30:21.883 --> 00:30:25.350\ncuz you have to wait for the database to\nfully restore before you bring it online.\n\n590\n00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.230\nHere, we can bring the database\nonline right away,\n\n591\n00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.680\nand not have to wait for that to restore.\n\n592\n00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.700\nThere is one more thing that we\nneed to do, if we're actually done,\n\n593\n00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.790\nwhen all of our mailbox\nrestore requests are done,\n\n594\n00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.910\nwe can dismount the recovery database,\nand delete it.\n\n595\n00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:44.400\nSo, once it's done, you basically come\nin do a Dismount-Database RecoveryDB.\n\n596\n00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.600\nThat's what I called mine.\n\n597\n00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.850\nSo, I'm going to dismount it, take it\noffline, and then you can remove it.\n\n598\n00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:54.675\nAnd to remove it,\nwe can just do a Remove-mailboxDatabase\n\n599\n00:30:54.675 --> 00:31:00.290\n-Identity RecoveryDB and\nthat'll remove it.\n\n600\n00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:02.330\nIt'll remove it but\nit'll leave the files on the hard drive.\n\n601\n00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.930\nAnd that's what it's\nwarning me about there.\n\n602\n00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:05.090\nBut I'm done.\n\n603\n00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:07.170\nSo now I can go in and\nI can remove those files and\n\n604\n00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.620\nget rid of them and\nnow I'm back to being live.\n\n605\n00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.720\nAll right?\n\n606\n00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.530\nSo a lot of stuff involved\nthere to go through.\n\n607\n00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.110\nA lot of things that we have\nto be aware of and get set.\n\n608\n00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:20.350\nWe had a comment in the chatroom that\nwe saw the mailbox for Don Pezet.\n\n609\n00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.160\nWe saw the mailbox for Jane Smith.\n\n610\n00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.260\nWe didn't see administrator, right?\n\n611\n00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.820\nWhy didn't we see administrator?\n\n612\n00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.860\nWell, to be honest with you,\nI've never logged in as administrator.\n\n613\n00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.110\nIf you've never logged in as a user, their\nmailbox doesn't actually get created,\n\n614\n00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.720\ntheir mailbox gets created\nthe first time they login.\n\n615\n00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.564\nSo if they've never logged in,\nthey have an e-mail address,\n\n616\n00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.472\nthey have a configuration, but\nthey don't have a mailbox yet.\n\n617\n00:31:42.472 --> 00:31:46.846\nSo when I went to do the restore,\nit didn't find that mailbox and\n\n618\n00:31:46.846 --> 00:31:49.040\nit didn't offer to restore it.\n\n619\n00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.710\nOkay, I think there was another user,\nwas there another user in there?\n\n620\n00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.530\nI don't think administrator\nwas the only one.\n\n621\n00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.700\nLet's see if we had any other,\noh yeah, John Doe.\n\n622\n00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.820\nSo here's John Doe and I've never\nlogged in as John Doe either, and\n\n623\n00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.300\nso when I looked down here,\nit got me and Jane.\n\n624\n00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.390\nIt didn't get John Doe because\nJohn doesn't have a mailbox.\n\n625\n00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.990\nThere's nothing to restore.\n\n626\n00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.150\nSo sometimes these errors\nare indicating just that.\n\n627\n00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:10.240\nThe mailbox is empty.\n\n628\n00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.540\nSo you'll have to double check those and\nmake sure.\n\n629\n00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.920\nBut otherwise it's there.\n\n630\n00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.850\nYou could actually get even more\ncomplex with that recover command to\n\n631\n00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.340\nfilter out mailboxes that\nhave never logged in.\n\n632\n00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.940\nSo there's ways to do that.\n\n633\n00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.499\nBut otherwise it does the recovery and\nyou're back in business.\n\n634\n00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.790\nAll right well, in this episode we got\na chance to see a dial tone restore.\n\n635\n00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.750\nIt was a lot more involved than\njust a regular restore, but\n\n636\n00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:33.670\nit serves its purpose.\n\n637\n00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.620\nIt gets our database back\nonline as fast as we can,\n\n638\n00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.790\nand gets people back in their\nemail as quick as possible so\n\n639\n00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.280\ndefinitely a great solution that's out\nthere and one that's available to you.\n\n640\n00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.259\nAll right well I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n641\n00:32:44.259 --> 00:32:48.539\nThat's all I've got for this episode, so\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n642\n00:32:48.539 --> 00:32:49.566\nAnd I'll see you next time.\n\n643\n00:32:49.566 --> 00:32:55.280\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.310\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.201\nI'm your host,\n\n5\n00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:20.690\nDon Pezet, back again with another\nepisode of Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.360\nNow, in this episode,\nwe're gonna take a look at backing up and\n\n7\n00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.930\nrestoring public folders and\npublic folder data in Exchange 2013.\n\n8\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.780\nAnd I have to throw that little caveat\non the end there, it's in Exchange 2013,\n\n9\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.950\nbecause every previous\nversion of Exchange did it\n\n10\n00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.940\ndifferently than the way\nwe're about to do it now.\n\n11\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.880\nWhy is that?\n\n12\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.000\nWell remember in earlier\nversions of Exchange,\n\n13\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.430\npublic folders had their own database.\n\n14\n00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670\nYou had a dedicated\npublic folder database.\n\n15\n00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.320\nAnd so\nit was different than a mailbox database.\n\n16\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.150\nAnd that meant the way that you backed it\nup and the way that you restored it was\n\n17\n00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.020\ndifferent, because it wasn't\na normal mailbox database.\n\n18\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.220\nBut starting in Exchange 2013,\n\n19\n00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.770\nyour public folders are no longer\nstored in a separate database.\n\n20\n00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.810\nIn fact, they're no longer stored\nin a database all together,\n\n21\n00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.750\nthey're stored in a mailbox.\n\n22\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.880\nYour public folders are just another\nmailbox right there on your server on\n\n23\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.940\nthe back end.\n\n24\n00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.710\nSo when we talk about backing up and\nrestoring public folders,\n\n25\n00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.970\nit's really the same as backing up and\nrestoring an individual mailbox.\n\n26\n00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.690\nSo, that makes life a lot\neasier on us as administrators.\n\n27\n00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.490\nBecause now we have one process to\nremember instead of two separate things.\n\n28\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.590\nBut, I do want to be thorough, so we're\ngoing to spend this episode taking a look\n\n29\n00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.280\nat this process and seeing how to\nget those backed up and restored.\n\n30\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.050\nBut if you've watched the episode\non single mailbox recovery,\n\n31\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.220\nyou'll see there's a lot of\ncommon elements here, all right?\n\n32\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.470\nLet's just start off with a basic public\nfolder hierarchy, kinda see what we have\n\n33\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.842\nthen we'll take a backup, and then we'll\nget a chance to see how the restores work.\n\n34\n00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:46.290\nAll right, so\nI'm logged into my server here and\n\n35\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.580\nI mentioned how public folders\nare now stored in a mailbox, right?\n\n36\n00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.640\nWhere do we see that?\n\n37\n00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.240\nWell, here in my Exchange Admin Center,\nI can go down to my Public Folders.\n\n38\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.260\nAnd inside of Public Folders,\nI can go to Public Folder Mailboxes.\n\n39\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.460\nNow if you're using public folders,\nyou're gonna have at least one mailbox.\n\n40\n00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.320\nThe first mailbox you create is\nthe one that has the readable and\n\n41\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.389\nwriteable copy of your public folders.\n\n42\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.910\nIf you add more than one mailbox you can\ncreate read-only clones of the mailbox.\n\n43\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.160\nAnd that's nice because you can\nhave them in different areas.\n\n44\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.990\nSo if your server fails,\n\n45\n00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.370\nwell your public folders are stored\non another server somewhere else.\n\n46\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.610\nYou just make that one writable and\noff you go, right?\n\n47\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.810\nOr clone the data from that\nmailbox back into your primary and\n\n48\n00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.130\nyou're back in business too.\n\n49\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.090\nSo if you've got clones, you might not\nneed to go to your backup at all, right?\n\n50\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.940\nSo when do we need to go to our backup?\n\n51\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.650\nWell, one, if we don't have clones, if we\ndon't have any other copies of our public\n\n52\n00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.690\nfolder database, or two,\nif our public folders are online,\n\n53\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.980\nwe're just trying to recover\nsomething old that was deleted.\n\n54\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.395\nMaybe I get a call from a user and\n\n55\n00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:48.827\nthey're like man I deleted something\ntwo months ago and now I realize I need\n\n56\n00:02:48.827 --> 00:02:52.611\nit it's really important I've got the\nlegal department asking me for it, okay?\n\n57\n00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:56.363\nWell if you've got clones they're\ndeleted on the clones too, right, so\n\n58\n00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:58.680\nthat doesn't really help us much.\n\n59\n00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.120\nBut if we've got backup tapes,\nright, or backup DVDs, or\n\n60\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.150\nwhatever it is that we backup to,\nthat's a different story.\n\n61\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.800\nWe might have backups from a year ago.\n\n62\n00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.070\nAnd so you can go and\nget one of the older backups and\n\n63\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.240\nrestore that data and bring it back.\n\n64\n00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.820\nAnd that's when it's really important.\n\n65\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.310\nSo I need to look here under\nPublic Folder Mailboxes,\n\n66\n00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.900\nbecause this is what's gonna\ntell me two things, right?\n\n67\n00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.700\nOne is gonna tell me\nwhether I have any copies.\n\n68\n00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.780\nSo I have copies, I can probably\ngo there for most of my needs.\n\n69\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.260\nAnd then two, it's gonna give\nme the name of the mailbox.\n\n70\n00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.330\nI need that name of the mailbox.\n\n71\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.480\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n72\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.963\nIt's not important for\nthe backup, but for the restore.\n\n73\n00:03:27.963 --> 00:03:31.470\nBecause when I do a restore,\nI just wanna restore that one mailbox.\n\n74\n00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.920\nI don't wanna restore\nthe whole mailbox database\n\n75\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.490\nbecause that's stored in a mailbox\ndatabase with other users too.\n\n76\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.730\nOr at least in mine it is.\n\n77\n00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.350\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n78\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.400\nYou could have it in its own dedicated\nmailbox database if you wanted.\n\n79\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.970\nSome people do that because public\nfolders are very read intensive.\n\n80\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.350\nPeople read from them a lot.\n\n81\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.480\nAnd they're not terribly\nwrite intensive but\n\n82\n00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.780\nwhen people do write they're\nwriting files in there.\n\n83\n00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.040\nAnd those files can be big.\n\n84\n00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.246\nSo you might choose to push those off\nonto their own mailbox database just for\n\n85\n00:03:55.246 --> 00:03:55.906\nperformance.\n\n86\n00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:57.640\nBut either way, I just need his name.\n\n87\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.950\nPublic Folders is what I called mine.\n\n88\n00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.290\nYou could have called yours Bob,\n\n89\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.340\nor whatever it is that\nyou wanted to call yours.\n\n90\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.890\nI called mine Public Folders\ncuz it's easy to remember, but\n\n91\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.980\nI'm gonna need to know that for\nthe restore.\n\n92\n00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.650\nAnd you can see on my Public Folders I've\ngot IT, Marketing, Sales.\n\n93\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.880\nI've got a few different things.\n\n94\n00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.590\nAnd if I were to fire\nup Microsoft Outlook,\n\n95\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.900\nI could connect right to those\npublic folders and get to it.\n\n96\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.800\nNow, I'm on my server, and\nI don't have Outlook installed, but\n\n97\n00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.480\nyou can get to it through OWA.\n\n98\n00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.320\nIf I fire up Outlook Web Access, you can\nget to your public folders right here.\n\n99\n00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.530\nIt's kind of a hidden feature, Microsoft\ndoesn't go right out to call it out.\n\n100\n00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.190\nIf you wanna connect to a public\nfolder from OWA, all you\n\n101\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.770\nhave to do is right-click on favorites and\nyou'll see Add a public folder.\n\n102\n00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.370\nAnd you can add public\nfolders to your favorites.\n\n103\n00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.570\nThat's the way that it's done in OWA and\nExchange 2013.\n\n104\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.470\nSo like I've got IT, but I could come in\nhere and add my other ones like Marketing,\n\n105\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.840\nand Sales, and\n\n106\n00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.230\nnow I'll have access to all of my public\nfolders, right here inside of OWA.\n\n107\n00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.600\nBut looking at the IT public folder,\nI can see I've got a report, right.\n\n108\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.150\nSo there's a sample report that's sitting\nthere, it's a rich text document and\n\n109\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.670\nif I go to open that up, there it is.\n\n110\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.760\nHere's this document that I've\nstored in a public folder, alright.\n\n111\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.910\nSo it's there and I know it's there but\n\n112\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.520\nit's not safe because I\nhaven't backed it up yet.\n\n113\n00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.570\nSo first off I need to take a backup.\n\n114\n00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.920\nFortunately, since the public folders are\njust in a mailbox database like everything\n\n115\n00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.020\nelse we run the same backup we would for\nanything else.\n\n116\n00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.520\nSo, I'm gonna jump back here to my\nServer Manager and I'm gonna run Tools and\n\n117\n00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.770\nWindows Server Backup and\nwe'll take a backup of that.\n\n118\n00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.350\nNow, actually you know what,\nI'm gonna have a slight problem here.\n\n119\n00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.030\nI'm on my client access server right.\n\n120\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.530\nSo this is LAB-CAS01 but mailbox database\nisn't on my client access server.\n\n121\n00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.900\nSo I need to backup a database\non a different server.\n\n122\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.220\nI need to go to my mailbox server.\n\n123\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.140\nSo I'm gonna jump over\nto my mailbox server.\n\n124\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.000\nWhoops, if I can remember where it is.\n\n125\n00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.060\nHere it is.\n\n126\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.580\nAnd I'm gonna do the backup here.\n\n127\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.500\nNow remember, Windows Server Backup\nis not installed by default so\n\n128\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.380\nI need to get it installed.\n\n129\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.080\nI'll just go over here to add,\nremove roles and we'll find it.\n\n130\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.940\nIt's not a role,\nI'm gonna skip past the role screen, but\n\n131\n00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.210\non this next screen where we get all of\nour features, that's what I'm looking for.\n\n132\n00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.260\nAnd if we scroll down we can find our\nWindows Server Backup right there and\n\n133\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.460\nI need to get it installed.\n\n134\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.090\nIt's kind of a tricky one because the icon\nfor the application is there by default.\n\n135\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.230\nIf I go down to Tools, you'll see\nWindows Server Backup already shows up.\n\n136\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.600\nAnd that's the client from\nWindows Server Backup.\n\n137\n00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.940\nI could use that to connect to\nother servers that are running\n\n138\n00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.290\nWindows Server Backup but\nI couldn't run a backup itself, all right?\n\n139\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.310\nSo what what I'm installing\nhere is the back end,\n\n140\n00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.750\nto actually get that backup\nfunctionally running.\n\n141\n00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.350\nNow I'm gonna take a backup.\n\n142\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.002\nAnd once I've got\nthe backup I'm gonna go and\n\n143\n00:06:29.002 --> 00:06:30.580\ndelete that email out of my public folder.\n\n144\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.020\nI'm just gonna remove it and\n\n145\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.970\nwe'll empty our recycle bin or\nwhatever try and get that completely gone.\n\n146\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.049\nWe have to purge it cuz otherwise\nyou have deleted item retention.\n\n147\n00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:41.529\nAnd deleted item retention last for\n30 days so, well,\n\n148\n00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:45.240\nit's 14 days on some systems by default,\n30 on others.\n\n149\n00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.310\nDepends on what service pack\nyou had when you installed.\n\n150\n00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.550\nIt's all customizable.\n\n151\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.250\nSo users might be able to recover\nright out of the recycle bin.\n\n152\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.310\nBut if it's really old,\nif it's three months, six months,\n\n153\n00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.040\na year old, we're gonna have\nto go to those backup tapes.\n\n154\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.970\nSo now that it finished installing I can\ngo and launch my Windows Server Backup and\n\n155\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.510\nI can take my first backup.\n\n156\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.970\nNow, when I do a backup, remember,\nI need to back up to a network location or\n\n157\n00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.460\nI can do a backup to a local hard drive,\n\n158\n00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.150\nif it's separate from the hard\ndrive where my data is, right?\n\n159\n00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.610\nSo I can attach a USB hard drive or\nsomething.\n\n160\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.190\nYou can also backup to DVDs, we got\na couple of different options there.\n\n161\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.170\nSo in Windows Server Backup,\nI'm just gonna go up here to Local Backup.\n\n162\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.240\nAnd this is the first time\nI'm running a backup, so\n\n163\n00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.880\nI'm gonna have to set a few options here.\n\n164\n00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.708\nIt's looking to see if I have\nany previous settings to load or\n\n165\n00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:30.047\na backup schedule in place.\n\n166\n00:07:30.047 --> 00:07:33.945\nAnd of course I don't, so it's not gonna\nfind anything, and so it's gonna offer for\n\n167\n00:07:33.945 --> 00:07:36.620\nme to set up my initial backup,\nand I can set up a schedule.\n\n168\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.970\nI'm just gonna do a one time backup here,\nso I'll set this backup up.\n\n169\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.270\nI'm gonna tell it to do\na full backup of my server.\n\n170\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.886\nNow you can back up individual\npieces of the server, but\n\n171\n00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:47.736\nMicrosoft's recommendation is\nalways to do a full backup.\n\n172\n00:07:47.736 --> 00:07:50.957\nAnd the reason is,\nif you have that full complete backup,\n\n173\n00:07:50.957 --> 00:07:52.876\nit includes bare metal recovery.\n\n174\n00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:55.441\nAnd even if I lose the whole server,\nI'll be able to recover that.\n\n175\n00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:57.279\nSo that's kind of a nice feature to have.\n\n176\n00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.650\nSo I'm gonna choose full server,\n\n177\n00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.550\nand you'll see my backup's still\ngonna be pretty small on this system.\n\n178\n00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.850\nAll right, so now it's asking\nwhere I wanna back it up to.\n\n179\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.890\nI'm gonna choose local drives, and I've\ngot an extra hard drive attached here,\n\n180\n00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:08.880\nmy E drive.\n\n181\n00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.840\nNow, technically that's\npart of the full backup, so\n\n182\n00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.370\nI'm gonna get a warning here\nabout it wanting to exclude that.\n\n183\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.750\nI'm okay with that, so I'll say okay.\n\n184\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.730\nAnd now I can see bare metal recovery.\n\n185\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.450\nIt's backing up the C drive,\nand the system state, and\n\n186\n00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.790\nthat's including the Exchange services and\nthe mailbox databases attached to it.\n\n187\n00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.760\nSo that's exactly what I want,\nI'm going to start that back up.\n\n188\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.130\nNow, the key take away here is\nthat when we do a backup for\n\n189\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.850\npublic folders, it's no different\nthan a backup for mailboxes.\n\n190\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.840\nSo its all one backup strategy.\n\n191\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.110\nWe don't need separate backup\nstrategies for different things,\n\n192\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.270\nits all done one way.\n\n193\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.780\nAnd when we go to restore,\nit's kind of the same thing.\n\n194\n00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.730\nIf I wanna restore the whole mailbox\ndatabase, it'll include user mailboxes and\n\n195\n00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.280\npublic folder mailboxes.\n\n196\n00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.920\nIf I wanna restore just a user or\njust a public folder, I can do that.\n\n197\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.770\nIt's done the same way.\n\n198\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.160\nRight, everything is much more\nsimple under Exchange 2013.\n\n199\n00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.120\nNow I say it's simple.\n\n200\n00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.090\nWe are still gonna have to jump to\nthe PowerShell as part of our restore, so\n\n201\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:02.810\nit's not completely easy, but at least\nit's easier than what it used to be.\n\n202\n00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:03.430\nRight.\n\n203\n00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.830\nSo I'm gonna let that run and\nthe backup's kind of churning along there.\n\n204\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.120\nIt'll move fairly quick.\n\n205\n00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.290\nThe larger your mailbox database is, the\nlonger this backup will take to run, and\n\n206\n00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.070\nif you're backing up over\na network it'll take even longer.\n\n207\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.120\nAll right, but\nonce it's done we'll be able to pick and\n\n208\n00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.720\nchoose the data out of it to\nget recorded and get in place.\n\n209\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.860\nAlso keep in mind there are third party\nsoftware solutions out there that can\n\n210\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.170\ndo this too.\n\n211\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.780\nThings like Semantic Back Up Exec,\nor Arcserve,\n\n212\n00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.120\nComvault, Acronis True Image, oh no,\nAcronis Advanced Back Up for Exchange.\n\n213\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.580\nThere's a number of products\nout there that'll do it.\n\n214\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.200\nMost of them don't really offer you\nanything you don't have right here in\n\n215\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.710\nWindows Server Backup, but there's two\nfeatures that people really pay for.\n\n216\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.540\nThe first feature is\ncentralized management.\n\n217\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.380\nIf you're backing up more than one server,\n\n218\n00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.460\nWindows Server Backup's\nnot really good for that.\n\n219\n00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.750\nMicrosoft has\nthe System Center Data Protection Manager.\n\n220\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:48.608\nThere's that one.\n\n221\n00:09:48.608 --> 00:09:51.640\nThe third party solutions can sometimes\nintegrate with other software better, so\n\n222\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.100\nyou might choose to go that route.\n\n223\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.130\nThe other feature,\nsingle item recovery, right?\n\n224\n00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.855\nIf a user calls me and says, hey Don,\n\n225\n00:09:57.855 --> 00:10:01.900\nI deleted this one document out of\na public folder, can you restore it?\n\n226\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.390\nI'll say yes, but the real answer is no,\nI can't restore that one document,\n\n227\n00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.620\nI have to restore that\nwhole public folder.\n\n228\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.340\nSo if I restore a backup from six months\nago, anything that's been deleted\n\n229\n00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.720\nfrom that period six months\nago is gonna be back again.\n\n230\n00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.890\nSo I can't restore just one document.\n\n231\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.410\nIf you want that granular\nlevel of restore,\n\n232\n00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.620\nthird party solutions are gonna\nbe the way that you want to go.\n\n233\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.930\nAll right,\nnow this backup is churning along, and\n\n234\n00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.670\nit's already done a snapshot of my server.\n\n235\n00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.840\nSo if I start making changes now, things\naren't gonna become part of the backup,\n\n236\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.670\nthey'll actually be separate, because\nof the way volume shadow copy works.\n\n237\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.820\nRight, the volume shadow copy snapshot\nright when the backup started, and\n\n238\n00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.210\nnow it's backing up that snapshot.\n\n239\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.180\nSo my database could be changing and\nupdating and\n\n240\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.740\nthat's not gonna get rolled back in here.\n\n241\n00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.730\nThat's a little bit of a difference too,\nfrom older versions like Exchange 2003.\n\n242\n00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.480\nWhere it would do a backup and\nthen it would turn around and\n\n243\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.420\ndo a second backup if anything new that\ncame in while the backup was running.\n\n244\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.710\nExchange 2013 doesn't have to do that.\n\n245\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.660\nIt's a true point in time back up.\n\n246\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.840\nSo when this is done,\n\n247\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.080\nI will have exactly what my server\nlooked like when this backup started.\n\n248\n00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.710\nAll right.\n\n249\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.110\nNow for my users,\nthey can still be in the system, right?\n\n250\n00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.480\nThat's doesn't really impact them.\n\n251\n00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.280\nSo they can be browsing\naround in their mailbox.\n\n252\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.350\nAccess might be a little\nslower during a backup.\n\n253\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.530\nWe always have discontention issues,\nbut otherwise they can get in and work.\n\n254\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.990\nWe could be adding new things, right?\n\n255\n00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.870\nSo if I fire up a new email,\nall right, everyone, a new post here.\n\n256\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.590\nI could call this, like, my to do list.\n\n257\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.480\nAnd I could say like, get stuff done.\n\n258\n00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.012\nAnd then go from there.\n\n259\n00:11:29.012 --> 00:11:30.300\nOops.\n\n260\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.560\nApparently I deleted my email by accident\nso we'll try that again [CHUCKLE].\n\n261\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.640\nSo we're going to get stuff done.\n\n262\n00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.180\nI wonder how I did that.\n\n263\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:37.880\nThat's amazing.\n\n264\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.030\nI'll have to go back and\nwatch the footage on that one.\n\n265\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.730\nSo I'm just going to create this,\nthis list.\n\n266\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.960\nAnd I'll post it, and so\nthat's getting added in.\n\n267\n00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.610\nSee I'm working with it even though the\nbackup is running and that's fine, right.\n\n268\n00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.690\nSo we can keep manipulating that.\n\n269\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.490\nIt will take a second for\nthat document to actually show up here.\n\n270\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.270\nAlso that public folder\nmight be email enabled.\n\n271\n00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.570\nSo people could be emailing documents\nin and they'd be appearing right here.\n\n272\n00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.920\nThat's all just part of working\nwith the public folders.\n\n273\n00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.850\nBut if I take something like that sample\nreport, and I delete it, right, well,\n\n274\n00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.170\nlet's make sure that backup\nis actually finished.\n\n275\n00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.090\nIt's almost there.\n\n276\n00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.940\nI wanna make sure it's actually finished,\nso\n\n277\n00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.350\nwe can see that I'm truly deleting\nthis after the backup is done.\n\n278\n00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.450\nAnd once we delete it out,\nwhere does that go?\n\n279\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.610\nWell, it can go in your recycle bin,\nit goes in the deleted item repository in\n\n280\n00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.680\nthe background,\nit kind of gets hidden, all right.\n\n281\n00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.310\nNow, we could recover from there.\n\n282\n00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.690\nBut if it's completely gone, a restore\nis gonna bring it back for us, and so\n\n283\n00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:28.990\nthat's the route that we'll take.\n\n284\n00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.720\nAll right.\nThis one is just on the cusp of\n\n285\n00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.300\nbeing finished.\n\n286\n00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.060\nThere we go.\n\n287\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.240\n100% of backup is done.\n\n288\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.890\nIt's writing it, and it's finished.\n\n289\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.450\nSo now I'm gonna jump back\nover here to OWA, and\n\n290\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.290\nI'm gonna take this sample report,\nand I'm just gonna delete it.\n\n291\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.800\nWe'll just delete that one out of there.\n\n292\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.390\nNotice how it's saying do you want to\npermanently delete the selected items?\n\n293\n00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.360\nNow, That's a little bit of a misnomer\nwhen it says permanently delete, okay?\n\n294\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.380\nAs far as you're concerned,\nit's permanently deleted.\n\n295\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.850\nAnd the reason is on a public folder,\nit has it's own recycle bin.\n\n296\n00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.200\nIt's not your recycle bin.\n\n297\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.720\nSo if I go down here to my deleted items,\nI don't see that.\n\n298\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.960\nAnd that's because these\nare deleted items from my mailbox.\n\n299\n00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.620\nBut up here,\nI deleted it from a public folder.\n\n300\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.410\nAnd so now it's gone, right?\n\n301\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.450\nIt's gone and I can't see that deleted\nitems folder, that recycle bin,\n\n302\n00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.090\nI don't have permissions to get to it.\n\n303\n00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:23.090\nAll right, now as an administrator It's\npart of the retained items, right?\n\n304\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.500\nThe recently deleted items, and\nwe can recover it that way.\n\n305\n00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.530\nOr if you have an in place hold\nconfigured, it will hold it forever,\n\n306\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.750\nif you want, so\nit can be held a long time.\n\n307\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.840\nBut as far as the end user is concerned,\nit's gone.\n\n308\n00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.980\nSo they call us the admins and they say,\nhey, I lost this item, all right?\n\n309\n00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.100\nWell, you can go back and recover it, so\nthat's going to be our next step here.\n\n310\n00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.340\nNow the first step to recovering a public\nfolder is to restore a backup, but\n\n311\n00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.940\nwe don't want to recover over\nthe live database, right?\n\n312\n00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.385\nIf we recover over the live mailbox\ndatabase we'll loose everything that has\n\n313\n00:13:51.385 --> 00:13:54.550\nhappened since it was initially or\nsince this backup was run.\n\n314\n00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:58.180\nSo I wanna do a restore, but\nI wanna restore to a different location.\n\n315\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.770\nSo I'm gonna go over here and\nchoose recover.\n\n316\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.160\nAnd I'm recovering my mailbox server.\n\n317\n00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.010\nI'll pick the date.\n\n318\n00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.190\nNow, I'll probably have to go\nback a few weeks, a few months,\n\n319\n00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.710\nhowever far back it is to get to\nthe backup that has what the user needs.\n\n320\n00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.660\nFrom there,\n\n321\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.765\nI can pick what I'm restoring now on this\none, what we wanna choose is applications.\n\n322\n00:14:16.765 --> 00:14:17.315\nRight?\n\n323\n00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:21.095\nThe Microsoft Exchange service is a little\nmore involved than just some basic files\n\n324\n00:14:21.095 --> 00:14:21.855\nand folders.\n\n325\n00:14:21.855 --> 00:14:24.695\nSo we need to make sure we choose\napplications, and in the list,\n\n326\n00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:26.105\nyou'll see Exchange right there.\n\n327\n00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:28.125\nSo I'm recovering Exchange.\n\n328\n00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:29.605\nAnd then it's gonna ask where\nit's going to restore to.\n\n329\n00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:32.475\nNow I don't want to restore\nit to the original location,\n\n330\n00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:34.575\nbecause I just want to\nget this one mailbox.\n\n331\n00:14:34.575 --> 00:14:36.830\nSo I'm going to recover\nto another location.\n\n332\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.570\nAnd if we browse the hard drive,\nyou can pick where.\n\n333\n00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:43.360\nI usually create a folder, so\nI'll make a folder here on my C drive.\n\n334\n00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.930\nAnd I'll just call this one RecoveryDB,\nright?\n\n335\n00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.620\nBecause what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ncreate a recovery database, a secondary\n\n336\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.460\ndatabase that's running in addition to\nour production, our live one, right?\n\n337\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.850\nSo this one will kinda\nbe running on the side.\n\n338\n00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.520\nSo I'm gonna create a folder\ncalled recovery DB and\n\n339\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.480\nwe'll go ahead and restore to that, right.\n\n340\n00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.670\nSo there showing it there's the mailbox\ndatabase that its bringing back and\n\n341\n00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.880\nwe'll hit recover, right.\n\n342\n00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.860\nIf you have more then one mailbox database\nit's gonna recover all of them, we'll have\n\n343\n00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.049\nto kind of pick and choose, but I've only\ngot one so I know exactly what I want.\n\n344\n00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.650\nAll right, now if I browse through my hard\ndrive, one of the things that it does,\n\n345\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:22.090\nis it recreates the folder path for\nwhere that mailbox database was stored,\n\n346\n00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.140\nand that's gonna make some of\nmy commands really long so\n\n347\n00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.230\nI like to shorten this up a bit.\n\n348\n00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.180\nI'm gonna browse on my hard drive and\nbrowse into that recovery DB folder,\n\n349\n00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.850\nlook at these folders right\nwe've got the GUID right there,\n\n350\n00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.530\nC program files Microsoft Exchange Server\nversion 15 mailbox,\n\n351\n00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.925\nmailbox database, and\nthen here's the actual data that I want.\n\n352\n00:15:39.925 --> 00:15:42.065\nI mean, it is buried deep.\n\n353\n00:15:42.065 --> 00:15:45.953\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is I'm\njust gonna cut all those files and\n\n354\n00:15:45.953 --> 00:15:49.697\nI'm gonna move all the way back\nup to that recovery DB folder,\n\n355\n00:15:49.697 --> 00:15:52.306\nand I'm just gonna paste them right here.\n\n356\n00:15:52.306 --> 00:15:55.206\nThe files, they don't have to\nmaintain that file path, and so\n\n357\n00:15:55.206 --> 00:15:57.903\nthis is just gonna make my\ncommands a lot shorter, right?\n\n358\n00:15:57.903 --> 00:16:02.080\nBut I can see that mailbox database right\nthere, and now it's in C:/ recovery DB.\n\n359\n00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.683\nOr I can deal with it.\n\n360\n00:16:03.683 --> 00:16:04.633\nAll right.\n\n361\n00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:06.923\nNow from here,\nI need to mount this database.\n\n362\n00:16:06.923 --> 00:16:10.530\nI need to bring it online, but I don't\nwant to mess with the production database,\n\n363\n00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.062\nso this has to be in addition\nto the production database.\n\n364\n00:16:13.062 --> 00:16:17.259\nSo I'm gonna go and\nfire up my Exchange Management Shell, and\n\n365\n00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:22.584\nin my Exchange Management Shell, if I\nspell it right, I'll be able to go in and\n\n366\n00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:26.550\nmount this and\nbring it online as a recovery database.\n\n367\n00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.160\nSo, oops.\n\n368\n00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.630\nIf I launch the right utility,\nI'll be able to do that.\n\n369\n00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.510\nSo let me get into my Exchange Management\nShell, and we'll get a chance to see that.\n\n370\n00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.210\nAnd once I'm in the shell, I'll be able to\nmount that database and bring it online\n\n371\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:42.010\nand have it in addition to my production\ndatabase, which is what I really need.\n\n372\n00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.990\nSo let me just get in there.\n\n373\n00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.670\nAnd the command that we're gonna run is\n\n374\n00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.620\nfortunately gonna be a lot shorter because\nwe moved where that database is residing.\n\n375\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.140\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna say New mailbox database.\n\n376\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.780\nAnd normally that would create\na true mailbox database, but\n\n377\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.290\nI'm gonna say -recovery so\nit that it knows it's not a real database.\n\n378\n00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.670\nIt's a backup not to let users in it,\nright?\n\n379\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.390\nThis will bring it online and let admins\nget into it but not regular users.\n\n380\n00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:08.950\nThen we give it a name.\n\n381\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.480\nI'll just call mine recovery db,\nso I can remember what it is.\n\n382\n00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.490\nAnd then we tell it where\nto find everything.\n\n383\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.670\nI need to give it the edb file path,\n\n384\n00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.300\nwhich is thankfully much shorter\nnow that I moved those files.\n\n385\n00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.080\nRight?\nSo c:/recoverydb/ and\n\n386\n00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.510\nthen I point to the edb file and\nthen I have to say the Log Folder Path,\n\n387\n00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.950\nwhich also is gonna be a lot shorter for\nme.\n\n388\n00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.370\nC:/recoveryDB, all right?\n\n389\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.320\nSo now it knows where to\nlook to find those files and\n\n390\n00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.250\nfolders and we're in business there.\n\n391\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.590\nThe only other thing I need to do is tell\nit the server that I'm restoring this to,\n\n392\n00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.080\nwhich for me is lab-mailbox01.\n\n393\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.320\nThat's gonna take that database,\nmount it, and bring it online.\n\n394\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.290\nNow, it's warning me here that it\nmight not have had a clean shutdown.\n\n395\n00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.970\nWhen a backup happens,\nit's a snapshot backup, and so\n\n396\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.760\ntechnically the database is running\nat that time, so it's not clean.\n\n397\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.940\nSo it didn't mount it for me.\n\n398\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.010\nI'm gonna need to clean it first.\n\n399\n00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.020\nWell, cleaning is not very hard.\n\n400\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.375\nIf we just get into our C:\\Recovery.\n\n401\n00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:09.690\nNot Recovery, RecoveryDB.\n\n402\n00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.220\nThat's where I need to be.\n\n403\n00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.220\nThere we go.\n\n404\n00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.160\nWe have the eseutil.\n\n405\n00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.760\nThe eseutil, it's a utility that comes\nalong with Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n406\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.510\nSo it's installed by default, and\n\n407\n00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.150\nit lets us perform database\nmaintenance on the files themselves.\n\n408\n00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.680\nThen so what we have to do is\nbasically is give it a clean shutdown.\n\n409\n00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.520\nWe have to rollback any incomplete changes\nand then we just have to index and\n\n410\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.540\ndefragment the database.\n\n411\n00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:38.370\nSo we do that with eseutil and the command\nthat we need to run is not that bad.\n\n412\n00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.470\nWe do need to know what\nour file prefix is.\n\n413\n00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.270\nSee how these files,\nthey all start with E00, right?\n\n414\n00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.530\nIf I have three databases,\nthen I'll have E00, E01 and\n\n415\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.110\nE02 for each of the three databases.\n\n416\n00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:56.680\nI just have one, so I have E00, so\nI'm gonna say, eseutil and then /r E00.\n\n417\n00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.740\nSo now it knows the prefix for\nthe files to look for.\n\n418\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.500\nAnd then I'm gonna tell it\nto clean up that database.\n\n419\n00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.670\nAnd that's gonna do\na clean shutdown on it.\n\n420\n00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.240\nThe larger the database,\nthe longer that'll take.\n\n421\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.000\nShouldn't take too terribly long.\n\n422\n00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.710\nBut now I should be able to mount\nthis thing, so let me go and\n\n423\n00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.970\nmount the database, RecoveryDB And\nthat should bring it online.\n\n424\n00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.750\nOnce it's online, as an admin, I can now\nreach into that database and pick and\n\n425\n00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.990\nchoose what I want.\n\n426\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.460\nI can restore the whole thing,\nif we wanna go crazy.\n\n427\n00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.780\nOr I can restore individual mailboxes.\n\n428\n00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.550\nAnd that's what I want.\n\n429\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.830\nI wanna restore the public folder\nmailbox to get that deleted data back.\n\n430\n00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:37.040\nSo I'm gonna do that by doing\na new mailbox restore request.\n\n431\n00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.080\nBut before I do that, I need to know\nthe name of the public folder mailbox.\n\n432\n00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.080\nAnd if you don't know it,\n\n433\n00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:47.090\nyou can do like a get-mailboxstatistics\nwhich would have been faster for\n\n434\n00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.355\nme to type than to do auto complete but\neventually we'll get to it there.\n\n435\n00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:54.550\nGet-mailboxstatistics and\nspecify the database name, so\n\n436\n00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.780\nthe database name would be the recoveryDB.\n\n437\n00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.480\nThat's useful if the public\nfolder's been deleted.\n\n438\n00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.480\nIn my case,\nthe public folder hasn't been deleted.\n\n439\n00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.500\nI can just go back into the Exchange\ncontrol panel or the Exchange admin center\n\n440\n00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.880\nand find it there, but if I didn't\nknow it I could pull it here and\n\n441\n00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.270\nwe can find, right there, public folders.\n\n442\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.510\nThat's the mailbox that I want to recover.\n\n443\n00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.290\nAll right.\n\n444\n00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:18.840\nAnd then from here,\nI can do a New-MailboxRestoreRequest.\n\n445\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.900\nAnd when we go to restore it, we basically\ntell it to get data from the backup file,\n\n446\n00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.740\nfrom the recovery DB, and\nput it in the live database.\n\n447\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.800\nAnd then we just have to\nmap it to a mailbox, so\n\n448\n00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.990\nI'll tell it that the source\ndatabase is the recovery DB, right?\n\n449\n00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.360\nThat is where my data is coming from.\n\n450\n00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.720\nAnd then I tell it my source\nstore mailbox, right?\n\n451\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.210\nSo the mailbox in the backup,\nwhat is it called?\n\n452\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.930\nWell, its called public folders, right?\n\n453\n00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.320\nThat's what I called it.\n\n454\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.840\nAnd then we tell it the target mailbox,\nwhoops, sorry, mailbox.\n\n455\n00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.600\nThere we go.\n\n456\n00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.340\nAnd my target mailbox is also called\nPublic Folders because it hasn't\n\n457\n00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.590\nbeen renamed.\n\n458\n00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.840\nBut maybe I don't,\nmaybe I want single item recovery, right?\n\n459\n00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.810\nI don't want to restore the whole thing,\nI just want a single item but\n\n460\n00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.570\nI don't have third party software.\n\n461\n00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.190\nI could create another mailbox, and\nrestore this to that alternate mailbox.\n\n462\n00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.450\nAnd then as an admin,\nI could open that other mailbox and\n\n463\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.250\ngrab that single item out of it if I want,\nall right?\n\n464\n00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.850\nThat's how we can kind of cheat and\ndo single item recovery.\n\n465\n00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:15.710\nBut in my case,\n\n466\n00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.570\nit's just gonna be restored right\nback to the same mailbox name.\n\n467\n00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.750\nSo I need to punch that in.\n\n468\n00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.890\nNow, technically this is all I need and\nI should be able to press enter,\n\n469\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:27.140\nbut there's a little bug in Exchange 2013\nright now that hasn't been fixed yet, so\n\n470\n00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.460\nI need to tell it to skip over\nthe storage provider configuration.\n\n471\n00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.750\nNow, by the time you watch this, the bug\nmight be fixed, and if it is, you can\n\n472\n00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.610\nleave this off, or leave this command in,\nit'll be fine, it doesn't hurt anything,\n\n473\n00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.395\nthe storage configuration doesn't really\nhave a whole lot of bearing here.\n\n474\n00:21:41.395 --> 00:21:44.587\nSo I'm just gonna tell it to\nskip a little bit of data here.\n\n475\n00:21:44.587 --> 00:21:46.845\nAll right, at this point there is one\nlittle thing that we might need to add to\n\n476\n00:21:46.845 --> 00:21:50.495\nour command line and that's because\npublic folders are very old technology,\n\n477\n00:21:50.495 --> 00:21:53.805\nthey've been around and so there might\nbe a value called a legacy DN or\n\n478\n00:21:53.805 --> 00:21:57.655\ndistinguished name attached to it, and I\nhave to allow for that DN to be present or\n\n479\n00:21:57.655 --> 00:22:01.185\nnot present because on the new server it\nprobably isn't present, so I'm gonna say,\n\n480\n00:22:01.185 --> 00:22:06.620\n-Allowlegacydnmismatch.\n\n481\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.220\nOkay.\n\n482\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.760\nAnd what that says is if on this\nnew server, if it is a new server,\n\n483\n00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.730\nif the DN is missing, the legacy DN,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n484\n00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.730\nIf the legacy DN doesn't match,\ndon't worry about it,\n\n485\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.600\nlet's just get this restored.\n\n486\n00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.280\nYou don't really know because it\nall comes down to history, right.\n\n487\n00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.700\nHow old is this public folder,\n\n488\n00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.970\nwas it migrated from previous\nversions of Exchange.\n\n489\n00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.600\nThis is just gonna make sure that it goes\nnice and smooth to get that connected.\n\n490\n00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.410\nAnd then the very last thing,\nI need to say include Folders.\n\n491\n00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.820\nOops, I forgot my dash there.\n\n492\n00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.060\nI need to say -IncludeFolders.\n\n493\n00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.450\nAnd here's where I can specify\nthe individual folders inside that I\n\n494\n00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.430\nwanna restore.\n\n495\n00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.340\nIf I leave this off,\nit's gonna restore the whole thing.\n\n496\n00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.680\nWell I've got marketing and sales.\n\n497\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.870\nThey're not having a problem.\n\n498\n00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.500\nIt's the IT people.\n\n499\n00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.090\nThey're the ones calling and\ntelling me hey, you need to restore IT.\n\n500\n00:22:55.090 --> 00:23:00.840\nAnd so I need to give it the path for\nthat folder, which would be slash IT.\n\n501\n00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.470\nSo that's what I want to restore back and\nget in place.\n\n502\n00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.820\nSo the new mailbox restore request,\nit's getting the data from the recovery\n\n503\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:11.390\ndatabase, from the public folders mailbox,\nit's restoring it to the public folder's\n\n504\n00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.980\nmailbox on the production database, and\nit's getting that IT folder, right?\n\n505\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.020\nThat's what it's gonna grab and\nit's gonna restore.\n\n506\n00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.790\nAll right, well it looks like I\ngot an error and if we look at it.\n\n507\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:21.930\nOh, I see what's going on here.\n\n508\n00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:26.540\nWe've got folder path \\ IT contains\nan invalid escaped character.\n\n509\n00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.440\nI put the \\ in because that's\nthe path to the folder.\n\n510\n00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.720\nBut I don't need the backslash.\n\n511\n00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.300\nHere it's treating it\nas an escape character.\n\n512\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.930\nSo if I just rerun that command and\nleave that slash off,\n\n513\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:40.580\nI'm including the folder IT and I can use\ncommas to add other folders in there, and\n\n514\n00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:44.530\nso if I run that, there we go, it's gonna\ncreate that mailbox restore request.\n\n515\n00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.820\nAnd I can see that it's cued and\n\n516\n00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:52.000\nif I start to monitor to that I\ncan run get-mailboxrestorerequest.\n\n517\n00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.020\nAnd we can run that and\nwatch to see when it finishes.\n\n518\n00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.730\nThe larger the public folder is, the\nlonger it's gonna take to do that restore.\n\n519\n00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:02.040\nHere I see this one has run several,\nrun pretty quick, and completed already.\n\n520\n00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.570\nBut we might have to run this several\ntimes to actually see whether or\n\n521\n00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.700\nnot it has finished, all right?\n\n522\n00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.230\nBut once it's finished, that deleted mail?\n\n523\n00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:11.830\nNo, that should be back.\n\n524\n00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:15.260\nNow, in my own experience, I've seen where\npublic folders can take a little while\n\n525\n00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.150\nto show up though for the end user,\nespecially if you have copies.\n\n526\n00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.840\nBecause we just restored it to\nthe writable public folder.\n\n527\n00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.770\nBut if you've got copies of it,\nit's now gonna replicate and\n\n528\n00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.000\nit uses active directory application for\nthat.\n\n529\n00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.170\nAnd so\nit could happen in the next 15 minutes or\n\n530\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.060\nit could take up to 90 minutes to\nactually make it to the other side.\n\n531\n00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.980\nSo it can take a little while.\n\n532\n00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.600\nIn my case,\nI've only got one server though, so\n\n533\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.160\nit should show up pretty quickly.\n\n534\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.700\nLet me jump back over here and see if I,\n\n535\n00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.190\ndo like a forced refresh on this,\nif I can get it.\n\n536\n00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:47.190\nOutlook Web App also takes a little\nwhile to pick these things up.\n\n537\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.880\nBut if we take a look,\nthere it is, sure enough.\n\n538\n00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.010\nThere's my sample report back again,\nrestored from the backup, and\n\n539\n00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.810\nthe new stuff, right?\n\n540\n00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.490\nThis get stuff done,\nI did that one after I took the backup.\n\n541\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:57.800\nIt doesn't wipe out new stuff.\n\n542\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.505\nIt just brings back the old stuff, and\nnow I've got my public folder back and\n\n543\n00:25:01.505 --> 00:25:03.155\nI'm in business, okay.\n\n544\n00:25:03.155 --> 00:25:05.975\nSo the process is really, really,\n\n545\n00:25:05.975 --> 00:25:09.675\nreally similar to restoring a single user\nmailbox, just a little bit different.\n\n546\n00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:12.395\nWe had the legacy DN stuff\nwe had to worry about, and\n\n547\n00:25:12.395 --> 00:25:15.770\nwe had to specify the individual\nfolders we wanted to restore.\n\n548\n00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.620\nInstead of restoring the entire mailbox,\n\n549\n00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.060\nalthough we could've\ndone the whole mailbox.\n\n550\n00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.460\nAll right, well that pretty much\nwraps it up for this episode.\n\n551\n00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.350\nSo, in this episode we got a chance to see\nhow to back-up our public folder mailbox,\n\n552\n00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.710\nwhich really wasn't a big deal.\n\n553\n00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.790\nWe saw how to restore the mailbox,\n\n554\n00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.690\nget it mounted as a recovery database,\npick the data our of there and\n\n555\n00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.660\nmove it into our production database, and\nget it back and available for our users.\n\n556\n00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.780\nAnd the best part is this whole process\nfrom backup to restore was done,\n\n557\n00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.220\nwhile users can be in the database.\n\n558\n00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.990\nWe never actually had to kick\npeople out of the public folder.\n\n559\n00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.650\nThey could be in there working while\nwe were doing the whole process, so\n\n560\n00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.712\nit's really not that bad.\n\n561\n00:25:50.712 --> 00:25:53.838\nThe PowerShell command's a little lengthy,\nyet, that's kind of the tough one to\n\n562\n00:25:53.838 --> 00:25:55.998\nremember but\nthe rest of it's pretty straight forward.\n\n563\n00:25:55.998 --> 00:25:59.506\nSo, all right, well that's a good spot for\nus to wrap this one up, so\n\n564\n00:25:59.506 --> 00:26:03.498\nI hope you guys enjoyed the episode,\nsigning off for ITProTV I'm Don Pizet and\n\n565\n00:26:03.498 --> 00:26:04.787\nI'll see you next time.\n\n566\n00:26:04.787 --> 00:26:11.090\n[NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:15.800\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.600\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.490\nBack again with another episode\nof Microsoft Exchange 2013.\n\n6\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.110\nIn this episode, we're gonna take a look\nat restoring a single user's mailbox.\n\n7\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.500\nNow in other episodes we've talked about\nrecovering our entire database server, but\n\n8\n00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.630\nsometimes you just need one mailbox,\nright?\n\n9\n00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.880\nFor example, a user might have\ndeleted a bunch of their stuff and\n\n10\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.870\nthey want it back.\n\n11\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.580\nWell, you know, if they delete something,\nit goes to the recycle bin.\n\n12\n00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.310\nMaybe they emptied the recycle bin.\n\n13\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.370\nWell, there's deleted item retention\nthat holds it for 30 more days, but\n\n14\n00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.640\nmaybe they need something from two months\nago or three months, or maybe a year ago,\n\n15\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.620\nand it's been gone a long time.\n\n16\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.950\nWell, it's beyond their\nability to restore it.\n\n17\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.000\nAnd now it's up to us.\n\n18\n00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.120\nWe can go to our old back up tapes and\nwe can restore that user's mailbox.\n\n19\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.080\nJust that one user.\n\n20\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.590\nNow we can't restore individual email\nitems, not without third party software.\n\n21\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.110\nBut we can restore their mailbox.\n\n22\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.190\nIn other words, we could take\ntheir mailbox from a year ago,\n\n23\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.750\nmerge it into their Live mailbox and now\nthey'll have the missing data back again.\n\n24\n00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.730\nThey'll also have anything else they\ndeleted from a year ago back again too, so\n\n25\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.580\nit's gonna be a little bit of work on\ntheir part, but that's their own problem,\n\n26\n00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.670\nbecause they should have deleted\nstuff in the first place.\n\n27\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.880\nBut fortunately we can get to it, right?\n\n28\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.440\nAnother, let me give you\na more realistic example.\n\n29\n00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.290\nMaybe you terminated an employee.\n\n30\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.390\nThey got fired and she deleted their\naccount, deleted their mailbox.\n\n31\n00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.330\nWell, three months, six months later,\nyour legal department comes and says, ooh,\n\n32\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.210\nwe're under litigation.\n\n33\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.890\nWe need that user's mailbox, right.\n\n34\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.900\nWe need to recover the mailbox.\n\n35\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.920\nWell, it's gone from the server.\n\n36\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.060\nThe mailbox recovery,\nthe default period for it's 30 days,\n\n37\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.140\nunless you have like\nan in place hold on it.\n\n38\n00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.590\nThat data's gone, but\nyou go to your back up tapes.\n\n39\n00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.100\nYou can go and you can get it and\nyou can restore that data.\n\n40\n00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.540\nSo we can always get it bring it back and\nrestore that users mailbox.\n\n41\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.561\nBut we don't want to mess\nwith everybody on our server,\n\n42\n00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:58.020\nwe don't want to restore\nthe whole mailbox database.\n\n43\n00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.680\nWe just want that one mailbox, all right.\n\n44\n00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.850\nFortunately it's not that hard and\nif you've watched our dial tone recovery\n\n45\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.760\nepisode it's kind of similar to the dial\ntone recovery, except a little bit easier.\n\n46\n00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.070\nSo let's take a look at the process,\nand we'll see how to restore a user.\n\n47\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.345\nAll right, I'm gonna take a user like,\nI've got Jane Smith here.\n\n48\n00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:19.220\nJane Smith; she's an email user in\nmy system, and she's got a mailbox,\n\n49\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.610\nI'm actually logged into her OWA here.\n\n50\n00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.240\nShe's got one email here from the\nadministrator, it was sent back on Sunday.\n\n51\n00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.540\nAnd so she's got an email, very exciting.\n\n52\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.260\nRight?\n\n53\n00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.740\nWell maybe she's been terminated and\nI removed her mailbox, or\n\n54\n00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.890\nmaybe she just deleted some stuff.\n\n55\n00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.200\nIf I removed her mailbox, step one,\nI need to recreate her mailbox.\n\n56\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.170\nI can create a new active directory\nuser account and add a mailbox to it.\n\n57\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.370\nThe important part is that the mailbox\nneeds to have the same name,\n\n58\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.730\nand the same email\naddress as it had before.\n\n59\n00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.010\nSo, if she was Jane Smith, and\nher email was jsmith@itvprotv.net,\n\n60\n00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.650\nI need to create a new account called\nJane Smith and jsmith@itprotv.net.\n\n61\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.290\nAnd as long as the name is the same,\nI can restore her data to it.\n\n62\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.140\nEven if the name's different,\n\n63\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.740\nyou can actually get around that, but\nby default it wants those to be the same.\n\n64\n00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.070\nSo I'm gonna stick with that.\n\n65\n00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.420\nNow if they just had some deleted items,\nthe mailbox already exists.\n\n66\n00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.650\nI'm just gonna be merging into it,\nso there's no big deal there, right?\n\n67\n00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.340\nSo maybe she comes in and she deletes an\nemail, like I'll delete this admin email.\n\n68\n00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.350\nAnd I can go to her deleted items and\nthere it still is, right.\n\n69\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.850\nShe can recover that.\n\n70\n00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.516\nAnd then if she goes in here and\nempties that out, now it's gone, right,\n\n71\n00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:23.220\nit's gone forever.\n\n72\n00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.220\nWell not really.\n\n73\n00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.750\nExchange is gonna keep it.\n\n74\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.790\nAnd assuming I'm at like a default install\nof Exchange, it's gonna hold that for\n\n75\n00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.560\n30 days.\n\n76\n00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.970\nSo even 30 days from now she'll\nbe able to recover that.\n\n77\n00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.050\nAnd if you right click on a mailbox,\nsee how I can go to recover deleted items?\n\n78\n00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.207\nAnd when we do that, oop,\nit wants to do a pop up so\n\n79\n00:03:40.207 --> 00:03:42.320\nI gotta approve the pop up real quick.\n\n80\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.910\nBut you can go to deleted items, you can\nright click and do recover deleted items\n\n81\n00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.450\nand in here, should be able to see,\nthere's the email still there.\n\n82\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.280\nRight, so\nyou really do have a big window of time.\n\n83\n00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.670\nThis is not something we're\ngonna be doing right away.\n\n84\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.250\nBut, I do have a nice little purge\noption down here at the bottom, and\n\n85\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.490\nI'm gonna purge this out.\n\n86\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.370\nNow if I purge it in the default\nconfiguration of Exchange,\n\n87\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.480\nthat's gone now, it's gone.\n\n88\n00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.690\nIf I have an in place hold or something\nlike that configured it's actually\n\n89\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.880\nbeing retained on the back end as\npart of our records management, but\n\n90\n00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.460\nshe wouldn't know that, she would\nthink that it's purged, all right.\n\n91\n00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.590\nBut that email's gone, and\nit's gone, and she can't get to it.\n\n92\n00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.120\nAnd then if she says, oh no,\nI really needed that email!\n\n93\n00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.800\nLet me call the help desk.\n\n94\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.430\nAll right she calls the help desk and\nthey send a ticket up to you as the email\n\n95\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.650\nadmin, and you now need to recover her\nmailbox to bring that back, all right.\n\n96\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.920\nNow we can't pick and\nchoose one email, so we just ask her,\n\n97\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.760\nhey, when did you delete it?\n\n98\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.220\nAnd she says, well,\nI deleted it last June.\n\n99\n00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.930\nSo we need to go and find a backup\nfrom last June, from right before,\n\n100\n00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.780\nas close as we can get to where\nshe deleted it, all right?\n\n101\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.150\nAnd then we can restore the backup,\nand merge that in.\n\n102\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.660\nNow to restore the backup,\n\n103\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.410\nI need to make sure that I don't\nmess with my current users, right.\n\n104\n00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.360\nI don't want to mess with\nanybody else's database, so\n\n105\n00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.050\nwe're gonna have to be a little sensitive\nto that as we go through and restore it.\n\n106\n00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.430\nLet me show you the process.\n\n107\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.630\nFirst off I'm gonna fire up\nmy Windows Server backup and\n\n108\n00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.510\nI'm gonna restore a backup that I've got.\n\n109\n00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.100\nSo I'll go into my server manager, I'll\ngo to tools, and Windows Server backup.\n\n110\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.150\nIf you use third party software,\nyou'd go to it.\n\n111\n00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.060\nI'm using Windows Server Backup.\n\n112\n00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.449\nAnd I need to find a backup,\nso I'll do recover.\n\n113\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.160\nAnd when I go to restore,\nit's gonna ask me when I want to restore.\n\n114\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.200\nAnd so I'll go back and\npick as close to the date,\n\n115\n00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.750\nbut prior to her deleting her content.\n\n116\n00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.090\nOr prior to us deleting that mailbox,\nright.\n\n117\n00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.680\nI just need to go back\nto that point in time.\n\n118\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.560\nThen, I'm gonna choose to\nrestore an application, and\n\n119\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.290\nI'm gonna be restoring Exchange, and\nthis is where it gets important.\n\n120\n00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.850\nAlright?\n\n121\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.220\nIf I choose to recover to the original\nlocation, it's going to restore\n\n122\n00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.960\neverybody's mailbox and\nI'm going to have a lot of angry users.\n\n123\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.910\nI don't want that.\n\n124\n00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.610\nOkay?\n\n125\n00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.600\nI want to restore to another location.\n\n126\n00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.220\nAnd so I'll browse and I'm going to\ncreate a new folder for this, so\n\n127\n00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.030\nI'll browse to my C drive, and\nI'll create a folder called Jane Stinks,\n\n128\n00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.270\ncause she's making me\nhave to do this work.\n\n129\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.840\nAlright, so I'm going to restore there,\nand so its going to restore that database,\n\n130\n00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.400\nand its going to drop it\nright in that folder.\n\n131\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.080\nSo we'll let it run, and\nits going to bring me back, and\n\n132\n00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.900\nthis will happen pretty quick.\n\n133\n00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.660\nNow the larger your database is,\nthe larger this restore will take.\n\n134\n00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.000\nUnfortunately you have\nrestore the whole database,\n\n135\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.240\neven though I just need Jane's mailbox.\n\n136\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.940\nI need the whole database so\nI can then pick the data out of it.\n\n137\n00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.210\nSo if your database is a terabyte in size,\nI'm gonna need another terabyte to be able\n\n138\n00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.580\nto restore this too, because now\nI've got two copies of the database,\n\n139\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.310\nthe live one and this recovery one.\n\n140\n00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.510\nFortunately, performance is not a concern,\nso\n\n141\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.080\nyou can stick a USB hard drive on your\nserver and use that as temporary storage.\n\n142\n00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.921\nCuz this is just temporary,\nwhile we get Jane's mailbox out of it.\n\n143\n00:06:31.921 --> 00:06:34.340\nOkay.\n\n144\n00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.720\nAnd I can browse on my hard drive and\nfind that folder.\n\n145\n00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.290\nSo I'm gonna browse into my JaneStinks\nfolder, and you'll see the GUID and\n\n146\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.980\nthis all this other folder stuff.\n\n147\n00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.500\nNow when it restores it, it restores\nit with the full database path and\n\n148\n00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.010\nit's really, really long, that path.\n\n149\n00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.630\nAnd so it's gonna make our commands\nthat we're about to run in PowerShell\n\n150\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.570\nreally long.\n\n151\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.700\nAnd I hate that.\n\n152\n00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.120\nSo one of the things I usually do is take\nthese files and just do a quick cut and\n\n153\n00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.000\npaste to move them into a path that's\na little bit easier for me to cope with.\n\n154\n00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.807\nAnd so I'm just gonna put them\nright into the JaneStink's folder.\n\n155\n00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.960\nSo it'll be easier for\nme to get at, all right.\n\n156\n00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.890\nThis is not an online database yet, so\nI can move these files wherever I want.\n\n157\n00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.150\nAnd remember I said you can put them\non a USB stick or something like that.\n\n158\n00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.010\nIf you know the database will fit on that.\n\n159\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.080\nSo I can see that it fits right here.\n\n160\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.280\nAnd I've got that database\nsitting ready for me, all right.\n\n161\n00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.930\nNow I need to jump to my PowerShell so\nI can start to do a little work.\n\n162\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.140\nAnd not just the regular PowerShell,\n\n163\n00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.450\nI need the Exchange Management shell,\nthis guy.\n\n164\n00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.270\nBecause that's the one that's gonna\nhave the Exchange commandlets attached\n\n165\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.090\nto it that I'm gonna need.\n\n166\n00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.690\nAll right.\n\n167\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.780\nFrom here,\nI need to create a recovery database.\n\n168\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.280\nI don't wanna bring that database\nonline and replace my existing one.\n\n169\n00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.930\nI need it to run in addition to it.\n\n170\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.640\nSo that's called creating a recovery\ndatabase, so I'll come in and\n\n171\n00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.210\njust say new-mailboxdatabase-recovery so\n\n172\n00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.640\nit knows that it's not a live database,\nit's a recovery one.\n\n173\n00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.810\nAnd then I needed to tell it\nwhere to find that database, and\n\n174\n00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.130\nhere's where the paths\ncan get really messy.\n\n175\n00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.230\nThe edb file path for me, fortunately is\njust gonna be in that JaneStinks folder,\n\n176\n00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.890\nand so I can point right to it instead\nof having to do that huge long path.\n\n177\n00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.790\nSame thing for the log folder path.\n\n178\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.530\nWhich is now much easier for me.\n\n179\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.240\nAll right.\n\n180\n00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.184\nAnd then last I need to tell it\nwhat server I'm attaching this to,\n\n181\n00:08:17.184 --> 00:08:21.010\nand I'm attaching it to\nmy lab-mailbox01 server.\n\n182\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:21.680\nAll right.\n\n183\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.730\nSo that's gonna take that and\n\n184\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.450\nbring it online as a recovery database and\noop I must have left something out.\n\n185\n00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.900\nI didn't give it a name.\n\n186\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.120\nSo I told it I was creating\na recovery database, but\n\n187\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.330\nI forgot to give it a name so\nI need to do that real quick.\n\n188\n00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.460\nSo I'm just gonna get back here and\nadd in dash name, and I'll give it a name,\n\n189\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.700\nyou can call it whatever you want,\nI'll call my recovery db.\n\n190\n00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.330\nJust cuz that's what I'm use to and\n\n191\n00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.680\nI can remember that it's\na recovery database, right?\n\n192\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.690\nNow it's gonna recover it and bring it\nonline, I know my database is clean, but\n\n193\n00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.292\nit's warning me that when we do a restore\nlike this the databases aren't clean,\n\n194\n00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:55.130\nbecause of the way volume\nshadow copy works.\n\n195\n00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.060\nSo we might need to do a little database\nmaintenance on it before we're ready to\n\n196\n00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.030\nrock, and I don't mind doing that\neven if the database is fine.\n\n197\n00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.900\nThis doesn't normally take long,\nso I'll knock that out real quick.\n\n198\n00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.234\nSo I'm gonna get into the folder\nwhere I've got that database,\n\n199\n00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:10.170\nand I'm just gonna run\na couple of quick commands.\n\n200\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.770\nReally just one command,\nis an important one.\n\n201\n00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.750\nI'm gonna do the ESEUTIL, and\n\n202\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.680\nthis is gonna let me do some quick\noffline database maintenance.\n\n203\n00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.170\nThis is the Exchange engine, it's utility\nthat lets us maintain those databases.\n\n204\n00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.780\nSo I'll say eseutil /r, and\n\n205\n00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.420\nthen I need the the three\ncharacter prefix of the database.\n\n206\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:28.940\nMine is E00.\n\n207\n00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.670\nIf this is your second database or\nthird database, it might be E01 or E02.\n\n208\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.770\nI need E00.\n\n209\n00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.610\nAnd then I need to tell it\nwhat I'm gonna do which is\n\n210\n00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.340\nperform some basic maintenance on it.\n\n211\n00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.470\nIndex maintenance and defragmantation and\nall of that good stuff, and\n\n212\n00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.920\nit's gonna process that.\n\n213\n00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.260\nThe larger your database\nis the longer this'll take.\n\n214\n00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.810\nIt could take ten or 15 minutes.\n\n215\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.469\nMy database is really small, so\nit happened almost instantly.\n\n216\n00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:54.510\nAll right.\n\n217\n00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.060\nOnce that's done,\nnow I can bring that database online.\n\n218\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.650\nSo I'm gonna mount database RecoveryDB,\n\n219\n00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.270\nand that's gonna bring\nthe database online.\n\n220\n00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.520\nNow, it's not replacing the Live database,\nthis is in addition to the Live database.\n\n221\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.740\nAnd once it's online, I can now pick and\n\n222\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.460\nchoose data out of it to\nmove into my Live one.\n\n223\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.520\nAnd so that's exactly what I want to do.\n\n224\n00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.610\nI want to get Jane's mailbox out\nof the recovery database, and\n\n225\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.200\nthen put it into the Live database,\nall right.\n\n226\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.880\nNow there is some naming that\nI've gotta worry about and\n\n227\n00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.300\nkind of figure that stuff out.\n\n228\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.600\nSo we might need to do a couple of\nother commands just to make sure things\n\n229\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.760\nare the way we want.\n\n230\n00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.396\nFor example, you can do\na GetMailboxDatabaseStatistics or\n\n231\n00:10:35.396 --> 00:10:39.650\nwait, [LAUGH] Get -MailboxStatistics,\n\n232\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:44.570\nthere we go, not Database and we can put\nthat at the recovery database to see\n\n233\n00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.530\nhow many mailboxes are in there and\nwhether it is actually healthy, and\n\n234\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:52.300\nthat's what I wanna do so\nI'm gonna point that at the recovery DB.\n\n235\n00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.540\nAnd when I run that,\nit gives me a list of the mailboxes,\n\n236\n00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.250\nand I can see Jane right there.\n\n237\n00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.020\nNow, why is that important?\n\n238\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.960\nYou might have forgotten\nthe employees name.\n\n239\n00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.750\nOr maybe the employee's name has changed.\n\n240\n00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.050\nOr maybe it was spelled differently.\n\n241\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.490\nWe need to know the name to be able to do\nthis restore, and so I can see that name,\n\n242\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.720\nas well as all the other mailboxes\nthat happen to be in this backup.\n\n243\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.590\nAnd you can run the same thing against\nyour production database to see what\n\n244\n00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.900\nthe name of the new account is.\n\n245\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.350\nSo that we've got those\nidentities that we can reference.\n\n246\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.872\nRight.\n\n247\n00:11:17.872 --> 00:11:20.970\nThe only problem with this is some\nstuff appears off the screen so\n\n248\n00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.130\nyou might wanna filter or do a format list\nor whatever to get this cleaned up and\n\n249\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.810\nsee all the actual data.\n\n250\n00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.380\nBut, I know that the account was\nJane Smith before, it's Jane Smith now.\n\n251\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.700\nThe email hasn't changed.\n\n252\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.809\nSo I can just jump right\nto doing the merge.\n\n253\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.050\nAll right.\n\n254\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.570\nSo to do the merge,\n\n255\n00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.920\nwhat we have to do is what's called a new\nmailbox restore request, all right?\n\n256\n00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.190\nYou do a restore request and then in the\nbackground it'll actually do the restore.\n\n257\n00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:50.710\nAnd I need to tell it to take Jane's\nmailbox, and go to the recovery database\n\n258\n00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.260\nand get any data from the recovery\ndatabase that matches her mailbox.\n\n259\n00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.170\nAnd merge it back into the live one,\n\n260\n00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.610\nthat's what's gonna restore\nthe missing email for her.\n\n261\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:04.840\nSo we'll just come through and specify\nthat source database is my recovery DB.\n\n262\n00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:13.680\nAnd the source store\nmailbox is her username.\n\n263\n00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.120\nSo whatever her username\nhappens to be in the system.\n\n264\n00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.820\nAnd you could do her email address, her\nprimary name, whatever it is that we want.\n\n265\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.860\nI'll just use her primary\nname there of JSmith, right.\n\n266\n00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.039\nThat's her alias.\n\n267\n00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.180\nAnd then after that,\nwe can just specify the destination,\n\n268\n00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.000\nright, where our information\nis going to be going to.\n\n269\n00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.042\nSo I'll say, -target mailbox, there we go,\nand I'm gonna point it to our Live one.\n\n270\n00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:39.150\nAnd here's where if you had a different\nname on the new mailbox, you could specify\n\n271\n00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:43.360\nthe different name, but if you keep it\nthe same, life is a lot easier on you.\n\n272\n00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.630\nAnd for the target mailbox, you generally\nwanna specify the email address.\n\n273\n00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.370\nNow why is that?\n\n274\n00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.260\nWell maybe I've taken Jane's email\naddress and attached it to my account.\n\n275\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.150\nAnd so\nI want to merge her mail into my account.\n\n276\n00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.760\nSo I could specify my email\naddress here and it would find me.\n\n277\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.430\nOr I can do it by email alias or whatever.\n\n278\n00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.760\nSo I'll just do her email address.\n\n279\n00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.470\nAll right, then that's really all we need.\n\n280\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.680\nBut there is a little bug in the current\nversion of Exchange, where if your storage\n\n281\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.970\nisn't exactly identical between\nwhen the backup was taken and\n\n282\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.950\nwhen it is now, it's gonna fail.\n\n283\n00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.870\nAnd so I need to just tell it\nto skip part of the merge.\n\n284\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.581\nAnd so I'm gonna say skip merging and\n\n285\n00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:25.320\nthen StorageProviderForSource, okay.\n\n286\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.360\nNow, if you're running this right now,\nyou need that command.\n\n287\n00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.540\nYou need it,\n\n288\n00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.550\nat the time of this filming the bug\nis in the latest version of exchange.\n\n289\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.730\nYou're going to need that.\n\n290\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.120\nBut if you're watching\nthis six months from now,\n\n291\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.380\nthat bug might be fixed,\nthen you might be able to leave that off.\n\n292\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.020\nNow it doesn't really matter.\n\n293\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.790\nYou can go ahead and\nleave it in there if you want.\n\n294\n00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.590\nBecause if your storage is identical, it's\njust gonna repopulate and so it's fine.\n\n295\n00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.850\nIf your storage is different,\nthis takes care of you, and you're fine.\n\n296\n00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.320\nSo it really makes no difference,\nbut we can leave that off and\n\n297\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.700\nthat'll make sure the restore\nhappens properly.\n\n298\n00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.250\nSo when this runs,\nit's gonna look to the recovery database.\n\n299\n00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.360\nIt's gonna get Jane's old email and\nmerge it into her Live one.\n\n300\n00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.470\nAssuming that I don't mess it up.\n\n301\n00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.510\nNow I'm getting mailbox JSmith\ndoesn't exist on database recovery DB,\n\n302\n00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.800\nso, they looked in the recovery\ndatabase and it didn't find it.\n\n303\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.760\nNow, I thought her alias was JSmith.\n\n304\n00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.560\nI'm gonna guess that it apparently isn't,\nso\n\n305\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.930\nif it isn't,\nI need to get that name right.\n\n306\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.600\nSo let me go back and\nI'll just use her email address instead.\n\n307\n00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.470\nAll right, well,\nit looks like I got an error on that, and\n\n308\n00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.740\nI thought her alias was JSmith and\nmaybe it isn't.\n\n309\n00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.420\nIt's tell me mailbox JSmith\ndoesn't exist on the database.\n\n310\n00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.070\nThat's fine.\n\n311\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:30.420\nI'll just change it, and instead of using\nher alias I'll use her full mailbox name.\n\n312\n00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.220\nAny mailbox name that's\njust your display name.\n\n313\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.690\nWe saw that with the Get-Mailbox\nstatistics earlier.\n\n314\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.920\nSo instead of saying source mailbox\nJSmith, I'll change that to\n\n315\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.600\nJane Smith written just like in the output\nfrom that Get-Mailbox statistics.\n\n316\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.300\nI saw that one on the screen so\nI know that'll work.\n\n317\n00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.760\nThe other one apparently not so.\n\n318\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.590\nWe'll run that and there it goes.\n\n319\n00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:56.190\nSo now it's queued up Jane's mailbox\nrequest and I can do a quick get\n\n320\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.880\nmailbox restore request, and\nit will show the status of that.\n\n321\n00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.504\nAnd she'll show as queued initially and\n\n322\n00:15:02.504 --> 00:15:04.990\nthen when it's done restoring\nit should show as completed.\n\n323\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.120\nSo now her mailbox has been restored and\nshe's back in business.\n\n324\n00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.230\nNow it's not a true restore it's a merge.\n\n325\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.860\nSo here mailbox is already live.\n\n326\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.980\nShe could already get into it and\nhave her data.\n\n327\n00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.840\nIt's just the things she deleted\nwill now be back again, or\n\n328\n00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.980\nif the mailbox was empty\nnow it'll be populated.\n\n329\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.240\nAnd the important part is I didn't\nmess with anybody else's mailbox,\n\n330\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.630\nI just messed with Jane's mailbox and\ngot her data back.\n\n331\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.080\nNow I say that,\nlet's go see if it actually happened.\n\n332\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.880\nSo now if we log into Jane's mailbox,\n\n333\n00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.980\nlet me just refresh this screen,\nwhat we should see, there it is.\n\n334\n00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.160\nThere's the email that she deleted,\nemptied the recycle bin, and\n\n335\n00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.090\nthen purged the recycle bin.\n\n336\n00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.800\nThat email's back again now.\n\n337\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.530\nRight, it came back as part of that merge.\n\n338\n00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.130\nIf she'd gotten new email that\nwould still be there too, right?\n\n339\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.540\nWe didn't delete anything.\n\n340\n00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.820\nWe just added back what was missing.\n\n341\n00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.460\nMissing folders, other content,\nand brought it back.\n\n342\n00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.610\nSo now that I've verified\nthat we're safe there,\n\n343\n00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.270\nthe last thing I need to do is\nget rid of my recovery database.\n\n344\n00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.690\nSo we can remove the recovery database,\nand just get it out of the system.\n\n345\n00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.090\nSo I'm gonna do a quick Dismount-Database.\n\n346\n00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:07.100\nAnd I'll dismount the RecoveryDB.\n\n347\n00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.000\nThat's gonna take it offline.\n\n348\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.810\nAll right, and then we can remove it.\n\n349\n00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.760\nNow when we remove it, it is actually\nnot going to delete the files.\n\n350\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.820\nIt will leave the files behind, but\nit will remove it from Exchange and\n\n351\n00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.370\nthen we can go back and\ndelete the files ourselves.\n\n352\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:25.910\nSo, I'll say Remove--Mailbox Database and\nthen the Recovery DB\n\n353\n00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:30.350\nis what I wanna get rid of and that's\ngonna knock that one out, and there we go.\n\n354\n00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.100\nAnd so last but not least,\nto clean everything up\n\n355\n00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.880\nwe can get rid of that JamesStinks folder\nand then we'll be back in business, okay?\n\n356\n00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.810\nSo the cool part here\nis that we can jump in,\n\n357\n00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:44.290\nwe can restore an individual user's\nmailbox and we didn't affect anybody else.\n\n358\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:44.860\nThat's pretty neat.\n\n359\n00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.000\nAll right, well, in this episode we\ngot a chance to see how to restore\n\n360\n00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.220\nan individual user's mailbox, instead\nof impacting everybody on the system.\n\n361\n00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.950\nWe started by restoring the recovery\ndatabase, then we went through and\n\n362\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.310\ncreated a restore request to merge that\nuser's data from the recovery database\n\n363\n00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.670\nback into production.\n\n364\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.350\nAnd then we cleaned up by removing\nthat recovery database out of there.\n\n365\n00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:07.700\nSo pretty straight forward.\n\n366\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.470\nAnd if you watched the dial tone episode,\nthat was very similar.\n\n367\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.430\nThe only difference is we didn't have\nto do that database swap in the middle.\n\n368\n00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.890\nSo if you think about it, this is a way\nyou could do a dial tone database.\n\n369\n00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.160\nAnd it's much simpler.\n\n370\n00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:18.850\nRight?\n\n371\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:20.970\nBut the challenge here is just\nthe amount of time it takes.\n\n372\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.840\nRestoring one mailbox is not a big deal.\n\n373\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.780\nBut if you're restoring thousands of\nmailboxes, this can take a lot longer than\n\n374\n00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.060\nwe necessarily want, so the other recovery\nmethods are a little better for that.\n\n375\n00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.420\nBut for individual mailboxes, that's the\nprocess, and she's back in business, and\n\n376\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.850\ninto her mailbox.\n\n377\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.950\nAll right well, that's all I've got for\nthis episode, so\n\n378\n00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.040\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n379\n00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.575\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet,\nand I'll see you next time.\n\n380\n00:17:42.575 --> 00:17:48.879\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
