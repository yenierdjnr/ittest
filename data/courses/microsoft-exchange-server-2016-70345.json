70-345.\n\n3\n00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.870\nYou want to make sure that you're\nactually ready to take the exam, so\n\n4\n00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.520\nwe're actually have an entire\nshow based on that.\n\n5\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.130\nBefore we get started let's talk\na little bit about getting ready for\n\n6\n00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.590\nthat exam as well.\n\n7\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.690\nOnce you're fully prepared, make sure that\nyou go to your Pearson Vue testing center,\n\n8\n00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.550\nand get registered,\nyou can do that online as well.\n\n9\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.230\nBut wherever you are in the world,\n\n10\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.520\nmake sure you also know that\nyou're gonna have to pay a fee for\n\n11\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.290\nthe exam as well, currently, right now\nin the United States, it's about $165.\n\n12\n00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.480\nMake sure you check your local rates, and\n\n13\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.030\nyou actually find out what\nthe price is going to be.\n\n14\n00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.990\nOnce you're registered, you'll go\nthere on the day of the exam, sit for\n\n15\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.790\nthe exam and then, of course hopefully,\npass the exam as well.\n\n16\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.070\nBut to ensure that you are ready and\nprepared for that, in our show we're gonna\n\n17\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.760\nhave Mr. Brian as being our subject\nmatter expert to help us out.\n\n18\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.570\nSo Brian, what are we gonna\nbe covering during our show?\n\n19\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.500\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Ronnie, so we've actually got,\nthis exam has six primary topics, and\n\n20\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.550\neach of the six topics represents\nabout 15 or 20% of the exam.\n\n21\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.830\nSo, the bad news is,\nyou can't focus on one topic because\n\n22\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.600\nthey're all evenly spread throughout,\nyou're gonna need to know a little bit\n\n23\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.532\nabout all these things to get ready for\nthe exam.\n\n24\n00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:23.100\nWhile we walk you through some of\nthe topics, we're gonna start at the top,\n\n25\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.310\nthe first one is plan deploy, manage,\nand troubleshoot mailbox databases.\n\n26\n00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.060\nSo this is all about the database side,\n\n27\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.660\nit starts off with a lot\nof sizing components.\n\n28\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.590\nHow many databases do you need,\nhow much storage do you need?\n\n29\n00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.050\nSo one of things you want to focus on,\nis how to size an environment if you're\n\n30\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.486\ngiven a certain set of circumstances, like\nmaybe you have a couple of thousand users,\n\n31\n00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:51.290\nthey each have a two gig mailbox,\nthey send 100 messages a day.\n\n32\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.370\nThe tool that you want to take a look at,\nmake sure you're familiar with,\n\n33\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.130\nis Exchange Server sizing calculator.\n\n34\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.850\nThat's that spreadsheet that will help\nyou calculate out the environment,\n\n35\n00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.510\nthe storage,\n\n36\n00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.750\neven the bandwidth if you decide to\ngo with database availability groups.\n\n37\n00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.450\nSo on the database side, there's a ton\nof topics, you're also gonna dive into\n\n38\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.970\ncreating databases, managing databases,\nmounting and dismounting,\n\n39\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.900\nmaybe get into a little bit of that\nstuff too, so that's topic number one.\n\n40\n00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.090\nFor topic number two plan, deploy, manage,\nand troubleshoot Client Access services.\n\n41\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.510\nSo, what we're talking about here is\nthe client population like your end users,\n\n42\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.970\nand how they get to all the services\nthat exchange has to offer.\n\n43\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.750\nSo, we're talking about everything\nfrom Outlook connectivity,\n\n44\n00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.960\nto Outlook on the web, to mobile devices,\n\n45\n00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.910\nanyway that anybody can get in and\nconsume the Exchange Services.\n\n46\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.460\nThere's a whole bunch of\ntopics to cover down here,\n\n47\n00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.760\nI wanna point out a couple of them.\n\n48\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.200\nWe have a little bit on authentication,\nknowing about form-based authentication,\n\n49\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.130\nkerberos based authentication, how to set\nthat stuff, we get into client namespaces,\n\n50\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.990\nall the names that people use,\nand have to remember.\n\n51\n00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.460\nYou think about mail.yourdomain.com, can\nyou use that across the whole environment,\n\n52\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.360\nwhere do you set that stuff up, and\ndoes it need to be different internally,\n\n53\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.450\nexternally?\n\n54\n00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.013\nAll right,\n\n55\n00:03:20.013 --> 00:03:24.130\na lot of planning considerations\naround the Client Access pieces.\n\n56\n00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.900\nAnd then also in there, we talk about\nsome of the networking pieces, too,\n\n57\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.510\nlike load balancing, and\n\n58\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.170\neven some site resiliency when it comes\nto getting the clients connected.\n\n59\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.778\nSo that's high level topic number two.\n\n60\n00:03:40.778 --> 00:03:45.125\nThe third one is the exchange,\ninfrastructure, recipients and\n\n61\n00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:49.330\nsecurity, planning,\ndeploying, and managing.\n\n62\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.825\nWhat you'll find in there is a lot\nof stuff on Active Directory,\n\n63\n00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:55.960\npreparing Active Directory\nto have exchange.\n\n64\n00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.740\nWe're talking about schema updates,\ndomain preparation, and\n\n65\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.115\nthe other pieces are around security,\nmail unable to object permissions.\n\n66\n00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:09.800\nThese is a very tough area,\n\n67\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.650\nall the permission stuff, we have\na lot of role based access control, so\n\n68\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.580\na couple of things I wanna point out here,\nhow do we give our administrators\n\n69\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.480\naccess to the environment,\nwithout giving them more than they need?\n\n70\n00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.110\nSo it's all about the principle\nof least privilege right?\n\n71\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.270\nYour gonna need to know\nthe built in roles,\n\n72\n00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.850\nyour gonna need to know\nhow to customize them.\n\n73\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.060\nOn the permission side, we're gonna dive\ninto anything from mailbox permissions,\n\n74\n00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.220\nto public folder permission.\n\n75\n00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.590\nHow do you give other people\naccess to somebody's mailbox?\n\n76\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.410\nThink about shared mailboxes, and\n\n77\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.410\nwhat if you just wanted to\ngive them access to a folder?\n\n78\n00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.689\nYou've got a lot of granularity there, and\n\n79\n00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.902\nthese are the details you're\ngonna need to know for the exam.\n\n80\n00:04:49.902 --> 00:04:52.110\nAll right,\nlet's talk about the next topic.\n\n81\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.270\nPlan, deploy, manage compliance,\narchiving, eDiscovery, and auditing.\n\n82\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.950\nSo this is an interesting one,\n\n83\n00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.600\nvery closely related to security,\nthere is a turnout detail here.\n\n84\n00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.150\nWhen we talk about compliance and\narchiving,\n\n85\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.907\nwhat we are talking about is, do we need\nto maintain data at the organisation, and\n\n86\n00:05:14.907 --> 00:05:18.720\nif so how long, and\nif we do, how do we do that?\n\n87\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.800\nWe can go with archiving as one example,\nwhen we thing of archiving,\n\n88\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.920\nthat's taking your mail data,\nand keeping it for the long term.\n\n89\n00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.350\nThere's a lot of choices and planning\nconsiderations, for example, do you wanna\n\n90\n00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.130\nkeep that archiving data on premises,\nor do you wanna move it up to the Cloud,\n\n91\n00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.280\nwhat are the different things\nyou need to think about there?\n\n92\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.630\nWhen we talk about eDiscovery, we're\ntalking about the ability for the security\n\n93\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.890\nteam to take a look at all of the mail\ndata throughout the whole environment,\n\n94\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.640\nlooking for something maybe to do with\na legal case or something similar.\n\n95\n00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.435\nFor the exam, you're gonna need to know\nhow to set up eDiscovery, how to run\n\n96\n00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:58.730\neDiscovery, and what permissions at\nyou're gonna need in order to do that.\n\n97\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.170\nAnd then finally, auditing for\nthis particular topic.\n\n98\n00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.270\nAuditing is capturing all of\nthe actions that were performed\n\n99\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.580\ntypically by an administrator\nwhile they're doing their job.\n\n100\n00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.833\nWhich commandlets did they run,\nwhich parameters, who ran it,\n\n101\n00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:15.940\nwhat did they run, what did they change?\n\n102\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.920\nYou're gonna need that stuff\nwhen you wanna go back and\n\n103\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.185\nfigure out what caused maybe an outage or\nsome kind of bad configuration change.\n\n104\n00:06:23.185 --> 00:06:25.435\nIn addition to\nthe administrative side though,\n\n105\n00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:29.095\nyou can also do auditing on\nthe mailboxes themselves.\n\n106\n00:06:29.095 --> 00:06:31.435\nSo if you're ever in a trouble shooting\nsituation and you wanna figure out,\n\n107\n00:06:31.435 --> 00:06:35.745\nwhat's going on with the user's mailbox,\nyou can turn on auditing on the mailbox\n\n108\n00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:39.895\nfor specific actions, whether they're\ncreates, or deletes, or removes, and\n\n109\n00:06:39.895 --> 00:06:42.685\nin troubleshooting scenarios,\nyou can dig that data up.\n\n110\n00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:45.810\nSo you're definitely gonna\nneed to know about that.\n\n111\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.180\nAnd then our final topic is implement and\nmanage coexistence,\n\n112\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.460\nhybrid scenarios,\nmigration, and federation.\n\n113\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.000\nThis is a whole flurry of topics,\nand their big ones too.\n\n114\n00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000\nThis is where we'll get into\na little bit of Office 365,\n\n115\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.810\nwhen you think about taking your\non premises environment, and\n\n116\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.020\nconfiguring it to be a hybrid\nenvironment with Office 365.\n\n117\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.110\nMaybe you're gonna have some mailboxes\non-premises, maybe you're gonna have some\n\n118\n00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.471\nin the Cloud, maybe you're gonna\nmove everything into the Cloud, but\n\n119\n00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.712\nyou're gonna need that\nco-existence time for\n\n120\n00:07:20.712 --> 00:07:22.866\na little while where you\nhave to manage both.\n\n121\n00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:26.560\nYou're gonna need to know the details\naround that set-up process,\n\n122\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.553\nwhat are the requirement,\nhow do users authenticate,\n\n123\n00:07:29.553 --> 00:07:32.620\ndo we need to do any sinking\nup to Azure Active Directory?\n\n124\n00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.630\nBeyond that we get into migration and\ncoexistence from earlier version,\n\n125\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:45.609\nso think about Exchange 2010 or 2013, you\nwanna bring 2016 into your environment,\n\n126\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.350\nhow do you do that, what are you gonna\nneed to know, what do you do once it's in?\n\n127\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.140\nAnd then how do you get\nrid of the old stuff, so\n\n128\n00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.570\nthere's a bunch of topics around that.\n\n129\n00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.580\nEverything from moving mailboxes\nwhether individually or\n\n130\n00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.340\nin batches, moving the public folders.\n\n131\n00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.000\nAnd then the last little piece you\nneed to move before you can start\n\n132\n00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.080\nthe decommissioning process, and\nthere's a lot of details even\n\n133\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.510\naround the decommissioning process, and\nI think that are covered here on the exam.\n\n134\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:19.130\nSo, that's quite a bit of stuff here,\nI do have one more that I left off,\n\n135\n00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.740\nand that's the plan, deploy, manage and\ntroubleshoot transport services.\n\n136\n00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.540\nSo, transport services\nare the backend services that\n\n137\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.850\nhandle the flow of email data, when you\nsend an email from one person to another,\n\n138\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.330\nwhether it's inside the company,\nor maybe out to the internet.\n\n139\n00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.710\nThere's a whole transport pipeline\narchitecture, some of which is new to\n\n140\n00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.250\nExchange 2016, that you're gonna\nneed to know the details about.\n\n141\n00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.660\nYou wanna really know, how does\nan email get from one place to another,\n\n142\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.730\nhow does it choose which route to go down,\nwhat are the infrastructure\n\n143\n00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.750\nconsiderations to change that routing,\nmaybe enhance a little bit?\n\n144\n00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.820\nWe're gonna dive into\nthose details in the show,\n\n145\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.390\nso that you're comfortable as you\nget those topics on your exam.\n\n146\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:09.760\nSo, that is a breakdown of high level of\neverything we want to cover on this show.\n\n147\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.900\nWe're gonna dive into when we talk\nacross the topic a lot of PowerShell.\n\n148\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.470\nSo, most everything today, from an\nadministrative prospective, you can do it\n\n149\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.260\nfrom the GUI components, like Exchange\nadmin center or from PowerShell.\n\n150\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.960\nFor exam preparation,\nI like to focus on the PowerShell pieces,\n\n151\n00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.350\nbecause those are the most testable.\n\n152\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.680\nSo, you'll see, we're gonna cover\na lot of the command line, but\n\n153\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.500\nwhen it's appropriate,\nwe're also gonna go into the Gooey,\n\n154\n00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.510\nbecause sometimes it shows you\na good end user experience and\n\n155\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.560\nwhat the impacts and\neffects of some of these changes are.\n\n156\n00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.580\nSo, be prepared for a lot of PowerShell,\nand let's get ready.\n\n157\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:53.790\nIf you think that you're gonna be\ntaking the exam 70-345, then we have\n\n158\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.596\nall this information coming\nup in the show, stay tuned.\n\n159\n00:09:58.596 --> 00:10:01.459\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:17.450\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.811\nAnd today you're watching planning,\ndeploying, and\n\n8\n00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:24.684\nmanaging Transport Services\nin Microsoft Exchange 2016.\n\n9\n00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:28.553\nAnd here with us, once again, is our\nExchange expert, Mr. Brian Swidergal.\n\n10\n00:00:28.553 --> 00:00:31.110\nBrian, welcome back to our studios,\nI'm glad you're here with us.\n\n11\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.420\nOkay, now Brian, as we get started and\n\n12\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.260\nwe start to take a look at our first topic\nhere on the Transport Services, right?\n\n13\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.340\nIt's all about moving data from\none location to the other.\n\n14\n00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.480\nWe want to begin where we need to begin,\nwhich is the idea of SLA's, right?\n\n15\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, SLA's, we talked about them one\ntime before, so we know what they mean.\n\n16\n00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.750\nService level agreement, the business and\nIT come to some sort of agreement that\n\n17\n00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.900\na certain level of service\nis gonna be provided.\n\n18\n00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.352\nThe primary difference here is now\nit's all about message delivery only.\n\n19\n00:01:04.352 --> 00:01:07.620\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what kind of\nagreements do we typically, actually,\n\n20\n00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.800\nhave to think about that are really\ninvolving message delivery here?\n\n21\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.410\nSo, I understand SLAs, but how do we\nactually do an SLA on a message delivery?\n\n22\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's an interesting concept.\n\n23\n00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.660\nAnd you don't see it in\na lot of organizations, but\n\n24\n00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.290\nthe bigger you go,\nthe more often you see it.\n\n25\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.000\nAround message delivery, SLAs, typically,\n\n26\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.320\nare aligned to how long does it take a\nmessage to get from one place to another?\n\n27\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.520\nWhat size attachments\nare you allowed to send?\n\n28\n00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.160\nAnd how long does it take\nan Internet email to come in?\n\n29\n00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.880\nIt's all about generally how long\ndoes it take, and how big can you go.\n\n30\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.500\nIt also sometimes gets into how\nlong net data remains around.\n\n31\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.170\nAnd well that data is protected in transit\nas far as losing messages in transit.\n\n32\n00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.040\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; So Brian on these SLAs,\n\n33\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.910\nwhen I actually send an email message\nto somebody else inside the building,\n\n34\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.610\nit happens instantaneously.\n\n35\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.920\nSo you're saying that even in an SLA,\n\n36\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.890\nyou can kind of even specify\na time limit on that?\n\n37\n00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can,\n\n38\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.860\nwhen you're talking about-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.017\n&gt;&gt; Internal email that's going inside\n\n40\n00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:18.978\nthe same building, it is so fast.\n\n41\n00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:21.599\nWhen you get to these global\norganizations though.\n\n42\n00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.210\nTalking about sending out email to, say,\n\n43\n00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.630\nthousands of people at\na time with attachments.\n\n44\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.930\nIt can take a long time.\n\n45\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.070\nYou put a couple hundred servers\nin an Exchange environment, and\n\n46\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.310\nthe routing is complex.\n\n47\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.790\nIt's gotta move through six, eight,\nten different servers on it's way.\n\n48\n00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.120\nAnd there's a lot of compliance\nscanning and security scanning,\n\n49\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.280\nanti virus, anti malware, Outlook, right?\n\n50\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.960\nAll the different pieces that are in play.\n\n51\n00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.392\nAnd that's when those little\nmilliseconds creep up to minutes.\n\n52\n00:02:46.392 --> 00:02:52.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when we start to take\na look at an Exchange design itself.\n\n53\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.880\nWhat's normally typically involved\nin improving this concept for us for\n\n54\n00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.300\nthe SLAs?\n\n55\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.200\n&gt;&gt; So it's the small stuff really, when\nyou think about look at attachment sizes.\n\n56\n00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.710\nIf you allow 250 MB attachment sizes and\n\n57\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.330\nyou've got a worldwide organization,\nit's gonna have a pretty big impact\n\n58\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.190\non how long it takes messages\nto move around the environment.\n\n59\n00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.831\nSo, if you want fast message delivery,\n\n60\n00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:19.039\nthen reducing the size of\nthe attachments is one place to start.\n\n61\n00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:21.800\nBut there's all these other\nlittle configurations too.\n\n62\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.320\nFor example, if you've got, say,\n30,000 people in the company,\n\n63\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.420\ndo you want to allow people to send email\nto all 30,000, big distribution list.\n\n64\n00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.340\nOr do you wanna restrict the size\nof your distribution list.\n\n65\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.940\nOn the infrastructure side,\n\n66\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.790\nwe're talking about making the routing\npaths the smallest and simplest possible.\n\n67\n00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.002\nSo if you've got a big organization,\nreducing the total server count.\n\n68\n00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:48.402\nReducing the hop count as the mail\ntravels around the various\n\n69\n00:03:48.402 --> 00:03:51.170\ndatabases can help you meet the SLAs.\n\n70\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Bryan,\n\n71\n00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.590\nanother particular requirement that we\nhave to think about here is the ability to\n\n72\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.920\nplan for intersite types of the email\nflow and the message flow here.\n\n73\n00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.733\nWhat do we need to consider when we\nstart talking about planning for\n\n74\n00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:07.516\nthis in our transport servic.\n\n75\n00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:09.548\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so intersite mail flow, and\n\n76\n00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:14.200\nI think we might have a couple of other\ntopics on mail flow that isn't intersite.\n\n77\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.860\nIt might be intrasite coming up,\nand intra-org.\n\n78\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.390\nSo there's a few of these,\nwe want to keep our terms straight.\n\n79\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.340\nIntersite refers to an email\nmessage that goes from\n\n80\n00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.900\none active directory site to another.\n\n81\n00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.930\nCould be an Exchange site,\nthey often are the same.\n\n82\n00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.618\nSo, I wanna walk you through a diagram\nthat visually depicts what I'm\n\n83\n00:04:32.618 --> 00:04:33.501\ntalking about.\n\n84\n00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.180\nSo, here we are, we're looking\nat a fairly simple environment.\n\n85\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.558\nWe've got four sites, Dallas,\nHouston, New York, and Los Angeles.\n\n86\n00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:46.584\nAnd I've got two users, right, and,\n\n87\n00:04:46.584 --> 00:04:51.920\nas part of the diagram I've got\nthe AD site link cost specified here.\n\n88\n00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.400\nExchange mail routing uses these\nAD site link costs by default\n\n89\n00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.200\nto figure out the path to take\nto route email intersite.\n\n90\n00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.220\nSo, let's take the example of George.\n\n91\n00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.820\nGeorge is gonna send an email message,\nhe's gonna create one up here.\n\n92\n00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.140\nAnd he wants to get it down here to Maria,\nbut what's the best path?\n\n93\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.356\nWell, let's take a look, if the mail\ntravels from Dallas to Houston to\n\n94\n00:05:19.356 --> 00:05:23.951\nLos Angeles, what we have to do is we\nhave to add up the cost, 50 and 100.\n\n95\n00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:27.590\nAnd that gives us 150, make that\na little bit better on the 5 here.\n\n96\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.310\nIf the mail travels from Dallas\nto New York to Los Angeles,\n\n97\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.000\nwe've got 100 plus 100, that gives us 200.\n\n98\n00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.779\nWell, then our primary preferred path\nis gonna be over here at the 150 mark.\n\n99\n00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.889\nThat's the whole foundation of intersite\ntransport is these AD site-link costs.\n\n100\n00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.720\nYou can actually define\nthe AD site link costs.\n\n101\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.010\nObviously, you can do\nit in Active Directory.\n\n102\n00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.535\nBut as an Exchange guy, what you'll end up\nfinding is that the Active Directory guys\n\n103\n00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:04.440\nhave these site link costs set for\nother reasons unrelated to Exchange.\n\n104\n00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.410\nIt might be DFS, or\nit might be Active Directory replication.\n\n105\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.730\nSo the Exchange guy has gotta figure out,\ndo all these costs work?\n\n106\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.470\nDo all the configurations work,\ndo the site links work?\n\n107\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.460\nOr, is there gonna be a special\nconfiguration needed?\n\n108\n00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.710\nIn such cases, you can define Exchange\nspecific values on the site links.\n\n109\n00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.070\n&gt;&gt; So Brian, since you just talked\nabout it, a question came into my mind.\n\n110\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.049\nWe don't have to use site links\nthat were already set up.\n\n111\n00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:33.470\nWe can then just say we want our own,\nor the cost, excuse me.\n\n112\n00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.570\nOn the cost there we want that just\nto be specifically for Exchange.\n\n113\n00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.520\nAnd that way we don't worry about\nthe DFS and stuff like that, right?\n\n114\n00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, let's draw that out\njust for a second to make it specific.\n\n115\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.610\nSo, if we really wanted Dallas to\nNew York to Los Angeles in this case,\n\n116\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.120\nwe know we have to beat 150.\n\n117\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.040\nSo what we could do over here\n\n118\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.960\nis we could set the Exchange\ncost to 25 on the site link.\n\n119\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.240\nAnd now on this side, we've got 125 total.\n\n120\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.750\nThat's the smaller of the paths, and\nthat's the path that's gonna go.\n\n121\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.710\nThat's a pretty oversimplification of the\nsetup, but it kind of gives you an idea.\n\n122\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.327\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes good sense to me\nin terms of taking a look at.\n\n123\n00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:20.773\nSo you said we need to make sure that\nwe're careful to distinguish intersite\n\n124\n00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:25.995\nfrom, also we wanna talk about,\nof course, planning for inter-org.\n\n125\n00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:31.270\nAre we now talking about mail flow\nbetween two different organizations?\n\n126\n00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.470\nIs that what we're talking about?\n\n127\n00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.947\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so, inter-org email,\nthere's really two aspects to it.\n\n128\n00:07:38.947 --> 00:07:43.108\nOne is, you send an email to somebody\nelse, in some other organization, and\n\n129\n00:07:43.108 --> 00:07:45.870\nit travels its way along the Internet.\n\n130\n00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.363\nAnd we do that every day, right?\n\n131\n00:07:47.363 --> 00:07:52.634\nThat's one form of inter-org, on the test,\nI think what we're more likely to see, is\n\n132\n00:07:52.634 --> 00:07:57.783\ninter-org where two organizations decide\nthat they're gonna communicate often.\n\n133\n00:07:57.783 --> 00:08:00.109\nAnd they want something more secure,\n\n134\n00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:04.840\nmaybe something more resilient than\njust communicating over the internet.\n\n135\n00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.370\nAnd in such cases,\n\n136\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.080\nyou can configure your organizations\nto route email directly back and forth.\n\n137\n00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.160\nAnd that's another form of\ninterorg email communication.\n\n138\n00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.690\nSo that's the primary difference,\nobviously when\n\n139\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.514\nemail leaves your environment,\nyou no longer control the routing.\n\n140\n00:08:22.514 --> 00:08:28.510\nAnd so it's a bit unlike what we just\nsaw with the inter-site diagram.\n\n141\n00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, so not only to we have\ninterorg and we have intersite, but\n\n142\n00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.780\nnow we need to distinguish that of course\nwith the idea of intra-site as well.\n\n143\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.045\nSo when we start taking a look at this,\nwhat is the scenario for planning for\n\n144\n00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:44.990\nintra-site types of transport here?\n\n145\n00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so for the intra-site scenarios\nI actually have another Visio diagram,\n\n146\n00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.460\nI just need a second.\n\n147\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.940\nI'm gonna pull it up and let's walk\nthrough that, it will help visualize.\n\n148\n00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwhen we start to take a look, right, so\n\n149\n00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.910\nfar Brian has actually already talked\nabout the idea of the intersite.\n\n150\n00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.960\nWhich is something that we'll\nmore than likely end up seeing\n\n151\n00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.130\nwhen you focused in on those\nActive Directory site links.\n\n152\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.560\nAnd then the interorg which gives\nus that idea of setting it up\n\n153\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.000\nbetween two different companies as well.\n\n154\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.990\nAnd what we're gonna see now of\ncourse is the intra-site diagram that\n\n155\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.730\nBrian is going to pull up for us,\nso that we can take a look here.\n\n156\n00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.270\nNow, Brian, what are we taking a look at?\n\n157\n00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.270\n&gt;&gt; All right, thanks Ronnie for that.\n\n158\n00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.800\nI did find the diagram and\nwe're displaying it here on the screen.\n\n159\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.530\nSo this is the huge lab network.\n\n160\n00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.650\nAnd we've got two pieces, we've got\nthe internal network here on the top,\n\n161\n00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.840\nthe big rectangle.\n\n162\n00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.920\nAnd then down here at the bottom\nis the perimeter network.\n\n163\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.260\nAnd we're talking about\nintra-site scenarios.\n\n164\n00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.670\nAnd I wanna just show you, we're talking\nspecifically about redundancy here too.\n\n165\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.870\nSo on the LAN we have two mailbox servers.\n\n166\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.090\nAnd to keep things simple, I drew out\nthe transport components only for\n\n167\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.510\none of the mailbox servers.\n\n168\n00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.000\nBut those same transport components exist\n\n169\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.600\non the other mailbox server\nin the internal network.\n\n170\n00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.040\nSo the first thing that happens, number\none here email comes in from the Internet.\n\n171\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.080\nAnd in a good environment, you're gonna\nhave a couple of different edge servers.\n\n172\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.390\nAnd there's gonna be some sort\nof load balancing around Robin,\n\n173\n00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.530\nmaybe with an MX record.\n\n174\n00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.370\nWhen the mail comes in,\nit has two places it can go.\n\n175\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:31.230\nIt can go to that first server or\nit can go up here to that second server.\n\n176\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.100\nThat's thats first point of\nredundancy after the Edge transport.\n\n177\n00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.350\nWhat ends up happening is\nthe receive connector grabs it and\n\n178\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:43.370\nthen at number two are front-end\ntransport services responsible for\n\n179\n00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.310\nsending it along the transport pipeline.\n\n180\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.300\nIt can opt to send to\nthe receive connector\n\n181\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.770\nin the transport service on\nthe same mailbox server or\n\n182\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.850\nit can also send to the secondary\nserver in the same site.\n\n183\n00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.310\nAnd this repeats itself as you move\nthrough the transport pipeline.\n\n184\n00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.530\nSo let's take a look at number three.\n\n185\n00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.360\nSo this is at the very end\nof the pipeline, right.\n\n186\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.280\nRight before it gets into the database.\n\n187\n00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.600\nYou can go to the mailbox delivery\ntransport service here get locally Or\n\n188\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.790\nyou can also come back down\nto the secondary server.\n\n189\n00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.580\nSo you can build redundancy for\n\n190\n00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.780\nintersite scenarios merely\nby having multiple servers.\n\n191\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.310\nAnd that's a key aspect of Exchange 2016,\nis the automation of some of\n\n192\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.290\nthat redundancy, just by placing\nthe secondary server in the same site.\n\n193\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.040\nNow, there used to be and\nolder term Brian,\n\n194\n00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.490\nas we continue to move through some\nof the different topics that we have.\n\n195\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.450\nIn Exchange 2013 I believe was called,\nthe transport dumpster, but\n\n196\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.150\nnow there’s another name for it.\n\n197\n00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.790\nAnd what is this thing about?\n\n198\n00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.730\nAnd why is it something that we’re really\nconcerned about making sure that we\n\n199\n00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.719\nplan and configure this?\n\n200\n00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.610\nSo yeah, so that old transport dumpster,\n\n201\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:04.160\nit has been renamed and\nit's now known as Safety Net.\n\n202\n00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.970\nAnd Safety Net,\nI think the most important thing is that\n\n203\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:13.390\nmaintain redundant copy of email\nmessages after they are delivered.\n\n204\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.680\nSo, a message has been successfully\ndelivered to a mailbox.\n\n205\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:22.390\nSafety nets responsible to hold a copy of\nthat message, for a set period of time.\n\n206\n00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.770\nAfter that period of time elapses,\nthe message is totally gone, and\n\n207\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.140\nit restarts that process with\nnew mail that's flowing through.\n\n208\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.890\nI do have another diagram, and\n\n209\n00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.300\nthese things really help visualize\nsome of these abstract concepts.\n\n210\n00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.950\nAll right so here's our diagram.\n\n211\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.710\nWe've got a single DAG\nspread across two sites.\n\n212\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.180\nI got a few mailbox servers out there,\n\n213\n00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.870\nand we're gonna start right here\non the outside of the network.\n\n214\n00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:53.000\nThis particular server it can be an edge\ntransport, it can be another server.\n\n215\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.180\nAnd what ends up happening is it\neventually delivers to a mailbox server\n\n216\n00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.620\nin the site.\n\n217\n00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.090\nThe second step that happens,\nthe mailbox server and\n\n218\n00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:06.370\nby the way we're eliminating some minor\ndetails here to concentrate on safety net.\n\n219\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.390\nBut the second thing that happens is\nthe mail goes into the mailbox database.\n\n220\n00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.460\nThe third thing that happens.\n\n221\n00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.470\nIs it also goes to the safety\nnet which is actually a cue.\n\n222\n00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.860\nAnd that can be\n\n223\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:26.230\npushed over to a mailbox server in another\nside if there was a fail over scenario.\n\n224\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.556\nSo that fourth step, if something\nhappened, let's erase that line,\n\n225\n00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:35.305\nif something happened out\nhere to this database.\n\n226\n00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:42.960\nSay before, so let me slow it down just\na minute cuz it gets a bit in depth.\n\n227\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.830\nIf we have a problem\nwith this database and\n\n228\n00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.300\nthis database needs to failover\nto this Mailbox server.\n\n229\n00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.250\nAnd it fails over but\ndoesn’t bring a copy of those recent\n\n230\n00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.580\nmessages because they\nhaven’t been played in yet.\n\n231\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.040\nThe Safety Net can come\nto the rescue by sending\n\n232\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.930\nall of those recently delivered messages\nto that mailbox server in the other site.\n\n233\n00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:06.580\nAnd that's one of the ways that Exchange\n2016 offers native data protection\n\n234\n00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.840\nwith safety net.\n\n235\n00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.010\nThere's a second feature and\nthat's called shadow redundancy.\n\n236\n00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:16.470\nAnd I think we're gonna be talking about\nthat next so Before we move on though,\n\n237\n00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:17.470\nsorry about that.\n\n238\n00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.430\nWe have one more scenario.\n\n239\n00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.380\nWhat I showed you here\nis the DAG scenario and\n\n240\n00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:28.030\nwhat I wanna show you next is\nthe scenario without a DAG.\n\n241\n00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.262\nGive me just a second and\nwe'll pull that up.\n\n242\n00:14:37.307 --> 00:14:40.930\nSo we have a new tab,\nturn this into presentation mode.\n\n243\n00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.550\nAnd get our drawing out.\n\n244\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.720\nThis is a bit simpler as you can see.\n\n245\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.930\nSo, we still have mail\ncoming in from the internet\n\n246\n00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.290\nIt's going to go to our mailbox server.\n\n247\n00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.520\nThat goes to the database.\n\n248\n00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.450\nAnd the third thing that happens\nis it goes to the SafetyNet cube.\n\n249\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.280\nSo all that's the same.\n\n250\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.260\nThe main difference now is that\nwe don't have a second site.\n\n251\n00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.470\nWe don't have a DAG.\n\n252\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.700\nWell, we don't have a second site,\nwe don't necessarily know.\n\n253\n00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:16.080\nIf we have a failure scenario, we can pick\nup all the stuff that's in the safety net\n\n254\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.120\nqueue and shove it over to that mailbox\nserver that's up there in the same site.\n\n255\n00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.530\nSo I think from a high level perspective,\n\n256\n00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.590\nthink a safety net messages\nare already delivered.\n\n257\n00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.070\nWe're gonna keep a copy around just\nin case we have a failure scenario.\n\n258\n00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.990\nAnd if we're gonna do,\nsay a restart from backup or\n\n259\n00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.860\nwe're gonna do a recovery situation.\n\n260\n00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.720\nWe still have the safety net to\npull back those last few messages,\n\n261\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.940\neven though they were recently delivered.\n\n262\n00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:46.970\n&gt;&gt; Now Brian, is this a default feature\nfor us inside the transport services?\n\n263\n00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.715\nOr is this something we have to\nconfigure and get it up and running?\n\n264\n00:15:50.715 --> 00:15:53.842\nYeah, it's a default features enabled.\n\n265\n00:15:53.842 --> 00:15:55.218\nIt's there for use, right?\n\n266\n00:15:55.218 --> 00:15:58.111\nSometimes you have to configure it.\n\n267\n00:15:58.111 --> 00:16:02.190\nAnd all you do there is really specify how\nlong you want those messages to be kept.\n\n268\n00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.280\nThe one other thing I wanna point out,\nit's optional feature.\n\n269\n00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.610\nSo for most environments\neveryone's interested in some\n\n270\n00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.390\nredundancy around their transport\nin the pipeline, right?\n\n271\n00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.860\nSo for most all intents and purposes,\nyou wanna keep it on and running.\n\n272\n00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.567\nBut I just wanted to point out\nthat it is indeed optional.\n\n273\n00:16:18.567 --> 00:16:23.159\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian, I understand that\nalso along with this idea of the safety\n\n274\n00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:27.391\nnet that it does require another\nservice for it to also work with us, or\n\n275\n00:16:27.391 --> 00:16:31.430\nto work with it so\nit can actually do its full functionality.\n\n276\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.090\nWhich is something that you had\nmentioned shadow redundancy.\n\n277\n00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:39.220\nSo what are the considerations there,\nis that something we\n\n278\n00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.390\nknow we definitely need it for safety net,\nbut what else do we need to know about it?\n\n279\n00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.200\n&gt;&gt; So\nshadow redundancy I think just mentioned,\n\n280\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.990\nright, it works in\nconjunction with safety net.\n\n281\n00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:55.900\nThe primary difference with it is that it\nprotects messages before they are sent.\n\n282\n00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.700\nAnd I think some of you guys are probably\ntrying to visualize, well, wait,\n\n283\n00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.760\nhow does it protect them\nbefore they are sent?\n\n284\n00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.660\nLet's show that in a diagram.\n\n285\n00:17:03.702 --> 00:17:08.200\nSo similarly, out here, we've got\ntwo sites, Site1 and Site2 up here.\n\n286\n00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.850\nWe've got our DAG.\n\n287\n00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.380\nAnd the first thing that happens.\n\n288\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.450\nWe got an SMTP server on the internet.\n\n289\n00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.370\nAnd it's gonna send an email message\nto the primary mailbox server.\n\n290\n00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:23.440\nWe're calling it the primary mailbox\nserver in shadow redundancy terms.\n\n291\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.450\nIt's just another mailbox server.\n\n292\n00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.770\nBut that's the one that got the message.\n\n293\n00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:32.240\nBefore it initiates\ndelivery to the database,\n\n294\n00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.930\nit establishes an SFTP\nsession to a mailbox server\n\n295\n00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:42.640\nin a second site that's part of the DAG,\nand that one we call the shadow server.\n\n296\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:49.060\nThe shadow server responds and says, hey,\nI got your message, we're good here.\n\n297\n00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.870\nAnd only at that point the actual\nfirst server says to this server on\n\n298\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:58.290\nthe Internet, hey, we're good,\nI got your message, transmission complete.\n\n299\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.040\nThat's, in a nutshell,\nhow the shadow redundancy works.\n\n300\n00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.910\nSo it's before they are sent.\n\n301\n00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.740\nThe interesting thing is that\nsafety net is still working\n\n302\n00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.080\nafter the message is sent.\n\n303\n00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.060\nSo you've got protection,\nkind of, on both sides.\n\n304\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.820\nNow, I want to show one more thing here.\n\n305\n00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.360\nThis situation that I diagrammed\nout was when you have a DAG,\n\n306\n00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.800\nlet's take a look at the second scenario\nthat we looked at with safety net which\n\n307\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.140\nis, what if we don't have a DAG, maybe we\ndon't have another server in another sit.?\n\n308\n00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.210\nIf we don't, a mailbox server\nin the same site can be used and\n\n309\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.280\nyou can actually configure\nthis if you don't have a DAG,\n\n310\n00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.480\nor optionally, if you don't want\nshadow redundancy to work across site.\n\n311\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.210\nTypically I like to stay\nwith the default cross site,\n\n312\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.880\nbecause that provides that site\nresiliency that's so important.\n\n313\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:55.260\n&gt;&gt; Brian, now along with both these\nfeatures that you talked about here,\n\n314\n00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.040\ndoes this add anything to\nthe delay of the delivery\n\n315\n00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.070\nof messages by having\nthese features turned on?\n\n316\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.172\n&gt;&gt; So the answer to that is no.\n\n317\n00:19:05.172 --> 00:19:09.331\nThese things are seamless, they work in\nthe background, users are unaware of them,\n\n318\n00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:12.507\nin fact half of the administrators\nout there are unaware of them,\n\n319\n00:19:12.507 --> 00:19:16.930\nbut they're really nice features built in\nto Exchange 2016 native data protection.\n\n320\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.270\n&gt;&gt; All right, the other thing\nof course then are always it\n\n321\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:25.220\ncomes back down to of course DNS a lot\nof times, what about planning for\n\n322\n00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.100\nredundancy of course of the MX Records,\n\n323\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.060\nthat's normally a big topic that we\nalso want to think about as well.\n\n324\n00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.240\nSo help us out with\nthe idea of the MX Records\n\n325\n00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.660\nthat we're about to take a look at.\n\n326\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so MX Records for a lot of you\nguys, are going to be more of a review.\n\n327\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.562\nBut there are some key concepts to be\naware of for the exam, so mail exchange or\n\n328\n00:19:46.562 --> 00:19:50.670\nrecords, that's the long name of\nMX records, are responsible for\n\n329\n00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:55.642\nenabling mail servers on the internet to\nfind your email server on the internet and\n\n330\n00:19:55.642 --> 00:19:57.900\nultimately deliver you mail to you.\n\n331\n00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.094\nI have a diagram I want to walk through\nspecifically around this redundancy topic.\n\n332\n00:20:07.307 --> 00:20:11.630\nOkay, so we've got two sites,\nSite 1 and Site 2.\n\n333\n00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:16.930\nAnd we've got an MX record\n\n334\n00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:23.700\nthat we're gonna call Mail domain dot com.\n\n335\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.500\nOver here we've got another\nMX record mail too.\n\n336\n00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.529\nThe only difference between\nthem is that we've got an MX\n\n337\n00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:39.190\nrecord preference of 10 on Site 1 and\n20 on Site 2.\n\n338\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.380\nSo what the preference does it says,\nwhoever has the lowest preference,\n\n339\n00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.090\nin this case it's ten,\nthat's who gets the mail first.\n\n340\n00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.570\nThe higher preference is never actually\nused unless there's a problem with\n\n341\n00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:51.820\nthe lower preference.\n\n342\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.390\nSo in the case of our diagram here\n\n343\n00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:59.320\nall the mail in-bound from the internet\nis always gonna go to Site 1.\n\n344\n00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.040\nIf there's a problem with Site 1,\nsay, the Edge servers go down,\n\n345\n00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.490\nthen we have what some people\nrefer to as a backup MX record,\n\n346\n00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.420\nwhich points all the mail to Site 2.\n\n347\n00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.150\nIn this particular configuration,\n\n348\n00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.630\nthis kind of guarantees that\nyou don't lose any email.\n\n349\n00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:21.410\nIf you didn't have a backup MX record or\nanother one pointing somewhere else, well,\n\n350\n00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.210\nwhen your perimeter network\ngoes down in Site 1,\n\n351\n00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.560\nyou're gonna lose inbound internet email.\n\n352\n00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.610\nSome of those people sending\nmessages to you are gonna resend and\n\n353\n00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.120\nyou might eventually get it, but\nit's something to be aware of and\n\n354\n00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.770\nI think this breaks down\nthe redundancy pretty good.\n\n355\n00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian, with the few minutes\nthat we have remaining, what are some of\n\n356\n00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.540\nthe other additional services that we have\nto really make sure that we understand\n\n357\n00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.850\nthat in terms of planning and getting\nready to work with the transport services?\n\n358\n00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot.\n\n359\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.610\nThis particular exam topic,\n\n360\n00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.460\nif I were to read it, and\nexcuse me looking down for a second.\n\n361\n00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.880\nBut plan, create, configure,\nTLS transport, Edge transport,\n\n362\n00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.500\nsend, receive connectors,\ntransport rules, accepted domains,\n\n363\n00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.960\nemail address policies,\nand address rewriting.\n\n364\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.360\nWow, that's a big one, right?\n\n365\n00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:11.010\nThere's a ton of topics and for the exam,\nit's a lot of material to cover.\n\n366\n00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:16.140\nOne thing I wanna focus on here in this\nsession is the Edge transport stuff.\n\n367\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.050\nAnd I wanna specifically walk through\nthe Edge subscription process\n\n368\n00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.260\nfrom the command line, cuz that's\none that's tripped a few people up.\n\n369\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.860\nAnd it's also one that's not that easy to\ntest as you're preparing for the exam.\n\n370\n00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.258\nSo let's drop down to the command line and\nwalk through the process.\n\n371\n00:22:38.007 --> 00:22:41.804\nFirst thing I'm gonna need to\ndo is get connected to Edge 1.\n\n372\n00:22:44.348 --> 00:22:47.353\nAnd that's our,\none of our Edge transport servers.\n\n373\n00:22:54.808 --> 00:22:58.430\nThe good news is it looks like\nour font is still nice and big.\n\n374\n00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.440\nThe first thing that we're gonna\ndo here is we're gonna use the new\n\n375\n00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.870\nEdge subscription commandlet.\n\n376\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.270\nWe're gonna give it a file name.\n\n377\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:10.157\nAnd in this case we're gonna\ngo to the temp directory,\n\n378\n00:23:10.157 --> 00:23:12.789\ncall this edge subscription.xml.\n\n379\n00:23:16.563 --> 00:23:18.490\nAnd we're gonna say yes.\n\n380\n00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:25.430\nSo there's a boot strap account that's\nused to negotiate this whole process.\n\n381\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.089\nYou get 1,440 minutes to complete it.\n\n382\n00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.390\nHopefully we don't need that kind of time,\n\n383\n00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:35.440\nbut let's look and\nmake sure we have our file.\n\n384\n00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.440\nSo see temp and there it is.\n\n385\n00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.188\nThere is really not much\nto it is an XML document,\n\n386\n00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:45.343\nwe'll pull it up in the browser here.\n\n387\n00:23:45.343 --> 00:23:49.991\nIt specifies the fully qualified domain\nname of the Edge Transport Server,\n\n388\n00:23:49.991 --> 00:23:54.211\nhas some versioning information,\nand it has the certificate blob.\n\n389\n00:23:54.211 --> 00:23:56.464\nI'm gonna talk a little bit about\nthe importance of this file\n\n390\n00:23:56.464 --> 00:23:57.220\na little bit later.\n\n391\n00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.837\nBut we have our file And the next step is\nto copy it down to the mailbox server and\n\n392\n00:24:01.837 --> 00:24:05.390\nthe site that we're going to subscribe to.\n\n393\n00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:10.390\nSo in this case,\nwe're going to go to MBX1.hugelab.net.\n\n394\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:16.262\nAnd let's try to hit this feed,\ndollar share, huge lab.\n\n395\n00:24:16.262 --> 00:24:17.952\nLet's go with my admin account.\n\n396\n00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:29.100\nOkay, so here is our C,\nlet's get over to the temp.\n\n397\n00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.572\nSo I'm gonna copy the Edge subscription\nfile from the Edge transport server to\n\n398\n00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:35.207\nmailbox server number one.\n\n399\n00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:39.308\nAnd now we are going to minimize that and\ngo to our mailbox server.\n\n400\n00:24:40.684 --> 00:24:41.859\nAnd here we are.\n\n401\n00:24:41.859 --> 00:24:45.120\nLet's just make sure we see\nthe file before we start.\n\n402\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:51.788\nSo this is gonna be C and\ntemp and there it is.\n\n403\n00:24:51.788 --> 00:24:56.240\nSo what can be nice and\nsimple is to switch to that directory.\n\n404\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.496\nWe're gonna use the same commandlet,\nwhich is kind of interesting.\n\n405\n00:24:59.496 --> 00:25:00.730\nNew Edge subscription.\n\n406\n00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.550\nAnd this one is pretty tough to type.\n\n407\n00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.340\nBear with me, what a lot of\npeople do here is copy paste.\n\n408\n00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:13.410\nBut I'm gonna type this manually and\nhope that everything goes good.\n\n409\n00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.421\nYou can see some brackets,\nvery tough to remember all this stuff.\n\n410\n00:25:21.696 --> 00:25:23.894\nAnd then we're gonna do a get -content.\n\n411\n00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.780\nA little tab completion.\n\n412\n00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.709\nThere we go.\n\n413\n00:25:28.709 --> 00:25:32.320\nWe're gonna specify the path to\nthe file that we just copied.\n\n414\n00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.431\nYou can actually do tab completion\non this, which is nice.\n\n415\n00:25:39.992 --> 00:25:41.617\nI'm gonna put that in quotes.\n\n416\n00:25:45.516 --> 00:25:49.362\nSo we're basically saying, hey, go out and\nget the content of this XML file.\n\n417\n00:25:49.362 --> 00:25:54.210\nWe're gonna talk about the,\nwe're gonna specify the encoding.\n\n418\n00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:58.570\nLooks like I, make sure I\ndidn't miss anything here dash,\n\n419\n00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.040\nthere we go, encoding byte.\n\n420\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.662\nRead count zero.\n\n421\n00:26:05.662 --> 00:26:08.903\nWe're gonna do two closed parentheses.\n\n422\n00:26:08.903 --> 00:26:12.460\nAnd then we're gonna specify\nthe site that we're subscribing to.\n\n423\n00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.566\nSo mailbox server number\none is in the Irvine site.\n\n424\n00:26:18.857 --> 00:26:21.990\nOop, got a file name problem here.\n\n425\n00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.970\nLet me look that's because it\nshould have been file data.\n\n426\n00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.940\nSo tab completion can sometimes get you,\n\n427\n00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.990\nespecially if you're going fast\non these complex commands.\n\n428\n00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:36.028\nThat's one of the reasons why I love\nto copy-paste these complex ones.\n\n429\n00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:40.300\nFile data should be\nthe correct term there.\n\n430\n00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.650\nAnd here we have it.\n\n431\n00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.130\nEdge sync requires that\nthe mailbox servers in\n\n432\n00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.710\nActive Directory able to resolve\nthe IP address for Edge1.hugelab.\n\n433\n00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.040\nI took care of that as a prerequisite.\n\n434\n00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.250\nAnd then establishing\nthe port connectivity.\n\n435\n00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:56.458\nSo now we've established the base, but\n\n436\n00:26:56.458 --> 00:27:01.668\nwe still need to start\nthe Edge synchronization.\n\n437\n00:27:01.668 --> 00:27:05.105\nAny time you see the parameters like this,\nit's good but\n\n438\n00:27:05.105 --> 00:27:07.836\nwe've also got success\nstaring right at us.\n\n439\n00:27:07.836 --> 00:27:12.116\nAnd now that we have that,\nlet's get the end subscription and\n\n440\n00:27:12.116 --> 00:27:14.765\nwe'll pipe that out to a format list.\n\n441\n00:27:14.765 --> 00:27:17.710\nAnd it gives you all your data\nabout the Edge subscription.\n\n442\n00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.490\nThat's our Edge server,\nthat's our domain name.\n\n443\n00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.690\nWe have our site listed up here.\n\n444\n00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.238\nAnd then this is a domain controller\nthat we were working off of\n\n445\n00:27:26.238 --> 00:27:28.050\nduring the whole process.\n\n446\n00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.652\nFinal command let I want to show\nyou here as part of this process.\n\n447\n00:27:30.652 --> 00:27:32.930\nTest edge synchronization.\n\n448\n00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.911\nSo what you want to see on\nthe sync status Is normal.\n\n449\n00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:42.650\nIf you see anything other than\nnormal you might have a problem.\n\n450\n00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:47.460\nSo what we just walked through is\nyou deployed a new Edge server,\n\n451\n00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.600\nyou subscribed to the Active Directory\nsite through PowerShell.\n\n452\n00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.500\nLooked at it, tested it,\neverything's good.\n\n453\n00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.347\nI think that's all we'll have\ntime to show for this segment,\n\n454\n00:27:57.347 --> 00:27:59.322\nbut a very important concept for the exam.\n\n455\n00:27:59.322 --> 00:28:01.316\nThis Edge process.\n\n456\n00:28:01.316 --> 00:28:05.420\n&gt;&gt; All right Brian, well that is a lot of\ninformation as we take a look at planning,\n\n457\n00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.470\nmanaging, and\ndeploying the transport services\n\n458\n00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.680\ninside of Microsoft Exchange 2016.\n\n459\n00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.290\nRemember that what we took a look\nat here today of course is\n\n460\n00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:19.110\nunderstanding that we need to\nconsider the SLA agreements and\n\n461\n00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.550\nthe requirements that\nare also set up there.\n\n462\n00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.848\nWe also took a look at planning for\nintersite,\n\n463\n00:28:24.848 --> 00:28:28.061\ninterorg I wanna make\nsure I say that right and\n\n464\n00:28:28.061 --> 00:28:33.380\nof course intrasite types of scenarios\nthat we have to think about.\n\n465\n00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:39.070\nAnd then we took a look at those two\nprotections that are also in place for\n\n466\n00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.820\nthe transport servers as well.\n\n467\n00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.715\nThe safety net as well as\nthe shadow redundancy.\n\n468\n00:28:43.715 --> 00:28:48.764\nMX records Brian also reminded us how\nimportant it is to have both that\n\n469\n00:28:48.764 --> 00:28:53.726\ninitial one as well as the secondary\nMX record that we need in place,\n\n470\n00:28:53.726 --> 00:28:56.960\nall that's very important for us too.\n\n471\n00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.140\nAnd then of course, some of the other\nservices that you of course can configure.\n\n472\n00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.520\nBrian showed us the one that\nmost people get tripped on, and\n\n473\n00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.970\nthat's the setting up of\nthe Edge transport to.\n\n474\n00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:10.928\nNow, if you're going wow,\nthat was a ton inside of that episode,\n\n475\n00:29:10.928 --> 00:29:14.975\nthere are more episodes to come for\nthe idea of transport services.\n\n476\n00:29:14.975 --> 00:29:18.920\nSo we are glad that you're staying\nwith us again for more that's to come.\n\n477\n00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.650\nBut for this episode that is plenty, and\nthat means it is time for us to sign off.\n\n478\n00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.857\nSo for ITPro.TV,\nI've been you're host Ronnie Wong.\n\n479\n00:29:26.857 --> 00:29:28.041\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Bryan.\n\n480\n00:29:28.041 --> 00:29:32.752\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Microsoft Exchange 2016 shows.\n\n481\n00:29:32.752

00:00:08.255\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:12.323\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.323 --> 00:00:15.072\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.072 --> 00:00:17.340\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.120\nAnd today,\n\n8\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.630\nyou're watching taking a look at planning\nan appropriate security strategy.\n\n9\n00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.850\nAnd here to help us out, is our\nExchange expert Mr. Brian Svidergol.\n\n10\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.180\nBrian, where we gonna begin\nwith Exchange security\n\n11\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.611\nstrategies here when we\nstart talking about it?.\n\n12\n00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:36.290\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, we've got two topics today.\n\n13\n00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.890\nFirst one we're gonna cover is BitLocker.\n\n14\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.510\nBitLocker is a drive encryption technology\nbuilt into the Windows operating system\n\n15\n00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.750\nthat you can use to\nprotect data on the drive.\n\n16\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.530\nHere's the deal.\n\n17\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.470\nIt's fully supported under Exchange.\n\n18\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.180\nYou can encrypt\nthe operating system volume,\n\n19\n00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.120\nyour data volumes, any of your volumes\nyou can encrypt with BitLocker.\n\n20\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.550\nLet's cover a couple\nbasics before we dive in.\n\n21\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.320\nSo, BitLocker relies on some sort\nof security mechanism to unlock and\n\n22\n00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.710\nprotect the data.\n\n23\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.480\nYou got two options here, one you\ncan have a trusted platform module,\n\n24\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.110\nthat's a hardware chip we\nnormally refer to it as a TPM.\n\n25\n00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.450\nIt's typically in any late model computer\nthat you buy today whether it be a client\n\n26\n00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.410\ncomputer or\na server you always will have a TPM.\n\n27\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.120\nWhen you do, you unlock some of\nthe advanced features of BitLocker.\n\n28\n00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.760\nAnd in our lab environment,\nunfortunately we're in a virtual\n\n29\n00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.760\nenvironment where TPMs\nare less likely to be.\n\n30\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.820\nBut they are starting to show\nup in the virtual enviroment,\n\n31\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.320\nstarting with server 2016.\n\n32\n00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.790\nSo for us, we don't have a TPM.\n\n33\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.780\nThat means we don't have some\nof the advanced features.\n\n34\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.350\nSo for when you do have a TPM,\n\n35\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.170\nlet me give you one of these\nfeatures that's important.\n\n36\n00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.170\nYou can do an automatic drive unlock, so\n\n37\n00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.570\non startup BitLocker wants to\ncheck to see if the TPMs there.\n\n38\n00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.010\nIf it's there and everything checks out,\nthe drive automatically unlocks and\n\n39\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.550\nyou can get access to\nall that encrypted data.\n\n40\n00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.640\nWithout a TPM,\nwhich is what we have in the lab,\n\n41\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.250\nwe're gonna be forced to enter\na password to unlock the drive.\n\n42\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.160\nOn an Exchange server,\nthat's a bit of a degradation, right?\n\n43\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.660\nYou restart the Exchange server,\nExchange wants to come up.\n\n44\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.990\nIt can't reach your database.\n\n45\n00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.590\nYou got it on an encrypted drive.\n\n46\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.930\nServices fail to start, you're typing in\na password, just not a good situation.\n\n47\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.560\nHowever, we're still gonna be able to\ndemonstrate the core techniques and\n\n48\n00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.330\nhave it turn it on and stuff like that.\n\n49\n00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.650\nWe just won't have the TPM.\n\n50\n00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.500\nSo without further ado, let's take a look\nat the process and walk through it.\n\n51\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.110\nWe're on mailbox server number two here.\n\n52\n00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.470\nAnd our first step is to add a roll.\n\n53\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.872\nWe're going to pick\nmailbox server number two.\n\n54\n00:02:51.032 --> 00:02:55.170\nWe're gonna go to actually feature\nBitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n55\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.170\nIt's gonna add a couple additional items.\n\n56\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.570\nWe're gonna hit Add Features, click Next,\nand then we're gonna click Install.\n\n57\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.000\nAfter this goes through,\nwe're gonna need to reboot the server and\n\n58\n00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.120\nthen we're gonna continue on\nwith the actual configuration.\n\n59\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.180\nAt this point the role or\nfeature will be installed, but\n\n60\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.020\nwe still won't have BitLocker\nconfigured anywhere.\n\n61\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.004\n&gt;&gt; Now Brian, if we enable this,\nlet's say that we've got multiple\n\n62\n00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:29.082\nExchange servers and multiple databases,\nwhere all this is kept.\n\n63\n00:03:29.082 --> 00:03:32.517\nAs we're configuring this and going\nthrough and everything is coming back up.\n\n64\n00:03:32.517 --> 00:03:36.916\nAre we gonna experience any performance\ndegradation on the ones that either have\n\n65\n00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.160\nit or the ones that don't have it?\n\n66\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.960\nIn other words that mixed environment\nwhere we have some with BitLocker and\n\n67\n00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.460\nsome without.\n\n68\n00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good question,\nwhile you're asking that,\n\n69\n00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.140\nI'm gonna answer that,\nit's prompting for a restart.\n\n70\n00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.750\nSo let's go ahead and kick the restart of,\nand then I'll get right back to that.\n\n71\n00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.850\nSo the role,\nwell the feature finished installing.\n\n72\n00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.285\nAnd we are going to restart.\n\n73\n00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.440\nAnd restart.\n\n74\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.437\nSo while we are waiting for\nthe restart and kicking that back off,\n\n75\n00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:14.534\nI think you're asking about potential\nperformance degradation with BitLocker.\n\n76\n00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:20.805\nMicrosoft has advised that there is\nan up to 11% hit on performance.\n\n77\n00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:23.489\nTypically though it's in\nthe single digits, so but\n\n78\n00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:25.565\nit's something you wanna account for.\n\n79\n00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.573\nAnd if you remember on day one,\n\n80\n00:04:27.573 --> 00:04:32.528\nwe were talking about sizing your\nenvironment, Iops, disk performance.\n\n81\n00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:35.358\nIf you're going to use BitLocker\nacross your environment,\n\n82\n00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.720\nit's certainly something\nyou want to factor in.\n\n83\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.700\n&gt;&gt; So, Brian as this reboot is happening,\nright, and the role is getting installed.\n\n84\n00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.920\nThis is where it is actually putting\nthe BitLocker pieces in place, so\n\n85\n00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.782\nwhen it reboots we should\nhave BitLocker ready to go?\n\n86\n00:04:50.782 --> 00:04:54.530\n&gt;&gt; So BitLocker itself will be\navailable to use after the reboot.\n\n87\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.200\nThen it's up to us to decide do we\nwant it on the operating system drive,\n\n88\n00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.200\nthe Exchange data drive?\n\n89\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.010\nWe choose and\nthen we manually configure that.\n\n90\n00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.390\nWhat we're going to do in our\ndemonstration is we have a third\n\n91\n00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.090\ndata drive.\n\n92\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.160\nIt's not holding any data and\nit's nice and small.\n\n93\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.920\nThat will allow us to go ahead and\nconfigure BitLocker run through\n\n94\n00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.150\nthe process without impacting Exchange for\nright now.\n\n95\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.050\n&gt;&gt; Sounds pretty good.\n\n96\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.550\nDo you think our server\nhas now finally rebooted?\n\n97\n00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.680\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look.\n\n98\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.035\nIt looks like it's coming back up\n\n99\n00:05:23.035 --> 00:05:32.488\nhere.\n\n100\n00:05:32.488 --> 00:05:34.830\n&gt;&gt; It, yep?\n\n101\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.770\nIt looks like we probably need to\nswitch on over to the computer screen\n\n102\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.610\ninstead of the white board there.\n\n103\n00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.970\nThere we go, excellent.\n\n104\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.800\nCool.\n&gt;&gt; All right just coming back up you\n\n105\n00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.300\ncan see it's working on features.\n\n106\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.716\nThis is pretty typical if you get\ninto it right as it comes up.\n\n107\n00:05:50.487 --> 00:05:52.970\nAll right, so now we are back in.\n\n108\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.730\nBitLocker is installed but\nI wanna point out if we look at\n\n109\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.060\nour drive configuration there's no\nindication that anything's encrypted.\n\n110\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.700\nI'll show you what it does look\nlike after it does get encrypted.\n\n111\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.170\nThe X drive is the one\nthat we want to configure.\n\n112\n00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.286\nAnd let me make this a little smaller so\nwe can do a little zooming in.\n\n113\n00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:19.149\nSo we're right-clicking on the X drive.\n\n114\n00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:23.372\nAnd there's a little option right here\nthat says, Turn on BitLocker, and\n\n115\n00:06:23.372 --> 00:06:25.730\nthat's gonna be specific to that drive.\n\n116\n00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.980\nSo we will do that.\n\n117\n00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.950\nAnd we're now prompted with\nhow we wanna unlock the drive.\n\n118\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.550\nAnd this is, one of the reasons\nthat we're getting this prompt\n\n119\n00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.490\nis because we don't have a TPM here.\n\n120\n00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.480\nSo we're going to use a password.\n\n121\n00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.648\nAnd let's see if we can come up\nwith something really strong.\n\n122\n00:06:48.818 --> 00:06:50.090\nWe're going to click Next.\n\n123\n00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.040\nThe recovery key, if we forget the\npassword, is our way back into the drive.\n\n124\n00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.510\nSo in this case we need to save it\noff; you can optionally print it.\n\n125\n00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.570\nI've never been a big fan of\n\n126\n00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.480\nprinting them,\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n127\n00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.400\n&gt;&gt; But I do like to save them to a file\n\n128\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.770\nand generally I like to save\nthem somewhere off the server.\n\n129\n00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.626\nSo in this case we're on NBX2,\nwhy don't we put this over on NBX1.\n\n130\n00:07:12.626 --> 00:07:19.010\nMaybe we'll throw it into the temp\ndirectory and then we'll click Next.\n\n131\n00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.990\nAnd then our next option, how much\nof the drive do you want to encrypt?\n\n132\n00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.740\nSo you can do Used Space Only.\n\n133\n00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.870\nOr you can encrypt the entire drive.\n\n134\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.210\nI always recommend going\nwith the entire drive.\n\n135\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.970\nBecause Used Space Only will encrypt\nthe data that you have on there now.\n\n136\n00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.420\nBut if you had data on there previously\nthat you deleted, well it's not gonna\n\n137\n00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.470\nencrypt that empty space and some of that\nold data could still be recoverable.\n\n138\n00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.040\nSo we're gonna flip down to\nencrypt the entire drive.\n\n139\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.129\nYou'll note that it does say that it's\na little bit slower but that's okay.\n\n140\n00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:53.756\nAnd then we can choose between\nthe compatible mode, that's for\n\n141\n00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:57.194\ndrive than can be removed from the device,\nlike a USB drive.\n\n142\n00:07:57.194 --> 00:08:01.971\nOr the newest encryption mode for us, it's\na fixed disk, so we're gonna go with that.\n\n143\n00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:05.424\nAnd now we're ready to start encrypting.\n\n144\n00:08:05.424 --> 00:08:09.300\nYou'll notice that lock icon, let me\nzoom in and show it a little closer.\n\n145\n00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.950\nSo the X drive, right here,\nhas this little lock icon on it now\n\n146\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.730\nas it's going through,\nstill kind of grayed out.\n\n147\n00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:23.850\nBut, that lock icon is going\nto be the icon to watch for.\n\n148\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.346\nIt's a quick way to figure out\nif a drive's encrypted and\n\n149\n00:08:26.346 --> 00:08:27.391\nif a drive is unlocked.\n\n150\n00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:37.890\n&gt;&gt; So, Brian, if we actually\nended up where we decided that,\n\n151\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:44.230\nthat is the technology we're going to use,\nbut my database is already 300 gigs.\n\n152\n00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.350\nThis process is probably gonna\ntake a bit longer, right?\n\n153\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthis process can take quite awhile.\n\n154\n00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:51.949\nYou want to plan for it.\n\n155\n00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:55.356\nThat'd be something you do in a change\nwindow, set aside, a bunch of time.\n\n156\n00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:58.200\nBecause, it's gonna run through,\nit's gonna take a little while.\n\n157\n00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.850\nI made a pretty small drive here.\n\n158\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.387\nThere's nothing necessarily\nto see after this, but\n\n159\n00:09:04.387 --> 00:09:09.741\nI wanted to point out that lock icon and\nthen from here on out, that will be there.\n\n160\n00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:13.775\nAnd it'll be easy for the administrators\nto figure out if the drive's unlocked and\n\n161\n00:09:13.775 --> 00:09:14.530\nwhat have you.\n\n162\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.770\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nas long as everything is good,\n\n163\n00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.190\nthen we at least have a full\ndrive encryption that we can use.\n\n164\n00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.970\nReally is something that's good and I\nthink Bitlocker's a pretty strong concept\n\n165\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.860\nfor us, in terms of a security strategy.\n\n166\n00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.660\nNow the other one though, Brian,\nis of course configuring S/MIME.\n\n167\n00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.630\nIf we've kind of been out of it a little\nbit, remind us a little bit about S/MIME\n\n168\n00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.330\nand then, what do we need to plan for\nin terms of security?\n\n169\n00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.576\n&gt;&gt; So S/MIME is an email encryption\napproach that allows individual users\n\n170\n00:09:45.576 --> 00:09:50.650\nto send encrypted email to other\nusers on the internet or internally.\n\n171\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.490\nS/MIME is based on certificates.\n\n172\n00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.230\nSo in order to work with S/MIME,\n\n173\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.080\nevery user that uses it\nneeds to have a certificate.\n\n174\n00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.220\nAnd that certificate needs to be trusted,\nat a minimum,\n\n175\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.530\nby all the people they're\ngonna send the email to.\n\n176\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.510\nSo in general, the recommendation is\nto use a third party certificate,\n\n177\n00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:15.440\nsomething that's trusted,\nprobably by a provider that's well known.\n\n178\n00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.830\nAnd you can acquire these certificates\nfrom all of the providers.\n\n179\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.560\nWe're gonna walk through\nthe step-by-step process.\n\n180\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.799\nAnd I'm gonna point out a couple\nof key facts along the way.\n\n181\n00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:27.800\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a great idea,\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n182\n00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.393\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe're gonna move over to Client One, and\n\n183\n00:10:32.393 --> 00:10:39.610\nI'm logged on as Jack Jackson, and\nI'm gonna walk through the MMC.\n\n184\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.148\nWe're gonna open up\nthe certificate snap-in,\n\n185\n00:10:43.148 --> 00:10:48.580\nand the certificate snap-in,\nwant to add remove a snap-in.\n\n186\n00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.709\nThe certificate snap-in for\nthe user account.\n\n187\n00:10:56.207 --> 00:10:59.980\nAnd, here's the certificate store for\njack.jackson.\n\n188\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.700\nI've already acquired a certificate for\njack.jackson, so\n\n189\n00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.150\nwe can walk through this demo.\n\n190\n00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.440\nAnd, I want to point something out for\n\n191\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.970\nthose of you that wanna walk\nthrough this in your home lab.\n\n192\n00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:15.110\nThis is a free certificate,\nit took about three minutes to acquire.\n\n193\n00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.472\nThere is a couple of providers out there,\none of them is name is Komodo.\n\n194\n00:11:17.472 --> 00:11:20.040\nYou can get a free email certificate.\n\n195\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.600\nThey're fully secured,\nthey're just like one you'd buy.\n\n196\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.340\nIt is very quick and easy to install and\nit'll let you walk through S/MIME stuff.\n\n197\n00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.085\nI've got that certificate, you can see\nit's here, valid from 3/14 to next year.\n\n198\n00:11:31.085 --> 00:11:34.320\nIt's a one year certificate.\n\n199\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.720\nOnce I've got that in place, Outlook\nknows to look in the users store for\n\n200\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.535\nthe certificate.\n\n201\n00:11:39.535 --> 00:11:43.660\nAnd if you've got one you're now\ncapable of sending S/MIME email.\n\n202\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.480\nSo let's take a closer look at that.\n\n203\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:54.668\nSo before we get into the Outlook stuff,\nI wanna walk through the process.\n\n204\n00:11:54.668 --> 00:11:57.590\nAnd I'm hoping that I can describe it\nin a way that's easy to understand.\n\n205\n00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.290\nIf we need to, we can always bring\nout the virtual white board.\n\n206\n00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.560\nSo here's the process,\n\n207\n00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.030\nI'm gonna say that Ronnie and I wanna\nsend each other an encrypted email.\n\n208\n00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.040\nWe each acquire a certificate,\nwe install it on our computers.\n\n209\n00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.605\nWe then cannot send each\nother encrypted email yet.\n\n210\n00:12:13.605 --> 00:12:15.220\nHere's how the process works.\n\n211\n00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.568\nWe each have to generate a new email\nto each other and we have to sign it.\n\n212\n00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:23.390\nSo with S/MIME you can sign,\nwhich is saying,\n\n213\n00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:29.410\nhey this email is certainly from me or you\ncan encrypt, which protects all the data.\n\n214\n00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.710\nIn high security situations\nyou wanna sign and encrypt.\n\n215\n00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.970\nSo our first step is I'm gonna\nsend Ronnie a signed email and\n\n216\n00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.800\nhe's gonna send me an assigned email.\n\n217\n00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.580\nWhen we get those emails, we're gonna\nright click on each other's names,\n\n218\n00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.490\nand add each other to our contact list.\n\n219\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.630\nThat's gonna enable Outlook to associate\nthe public side of the certificate\n\n220\n00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.230\nto my Outlook, which allows me\nto send him an encrypted email.\n\n221\n00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.220\nSo I'm gonna show you\nthat process right now.\n\n222\n00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.250\nWe're gonna generate a new email.\n\n223\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.550\nAnd I'll make this a little smaller,\nso we can zoom in along the way.\n\n224\n00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:09.494\nAnd for now, I am going to send\nthis to Brian Svidergol, and\n\n225\n00:13:09.494 --> 00:13:11.892\nI'll just say signed email.\n\n226\n00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:17.610\nSo that way they know to use this\none to start our S/MIME process.\n\n227\n00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.133\nI'm gonna then click on Options.\n\n228\n00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:27.170\nAnd you can see we have some options here,\nSign and Encrypt.\n\n229\n00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.278\nThe only we need at\nthe beginning is the Sign.\n\n230\n00:13:30.278 --> 00:13:32.454\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and click Sign,\n\n231\n00:13:32.454 --> 00:13:34.978\nwhich only works if you\nhave a certificate.\n\n232\n00:13:34.978 --> 00:13:38.690\nI'm gonna send that email off.\n\n233\n00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:44.810\nNow for demonstration purposes,\nI've already got one of these messages\n\n234\n00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.675\nthat I received earlier, and\nlet me take a look at that.\n\n235\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.870\nSo this email came in from one of\nmy email addresses where I have\n\n236\n00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.600\nanother certificate.\n\n237\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.870\nAnd in the bottom right-hand side,\nover here,\n\n238\n00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.810\nof the email message, you get this\nlittle signed email indication.\n\n239\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.459\nWanna show you what happens\nif you click on it.\n\n240\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:14.190\nWe're gonna click on the details and\nwhat it shows you is who sent this email.\n\n241\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.160\nIn this case brian@a1b2c3llc.com,\n\n242\n00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.690\nthat's the signer, and\nwe also have the certificate.\n\n243\n00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.802\nSo when I first got this email,\n\n244\n00:14:25.802 --> 00:14:30.940\nI right-clicked on his name and\nI added him to the contacts.\n\n245\n00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.365\nNow I've just got edit contact,\nbut normally I'd have add.\n\n246\n00:14:34.365 --> 00:14:37.840\nThereafter, I can send\nhim an encrypted email.\n\n247\n00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.290\nWhen he gets mine,\nhe does the same process and\n\n248\n00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.400\nhe can send me an encrypted email.\n\n249\n00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.140\nSo let me pause for a second Ronnie,\nin case, I know I've said a lot but\n\n250\n00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.110\nI still have more to say.\n\n251\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.414\nI wanna see if there's any questions so\nfar.\n\n252\n00:14:48.414 --> 00:14:51.500\n&gt;&gt; So far it looks like\nthe processing is very good.\n\n253\n00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.470\nLet's make sure that we understand.\n\n254\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.864\nFirst of all of course, we need to\nmake sure that we have a certificate.\n\n255\n00:14:55.864 --> 00:15:00.622\nAnd then once, we do to begin the process\neach person holding that certificate\n\n256\n00:15:00.622 --> 00:15:04.097\nneeds to at least exchange\na signed email to get started.\n\n257\n00:15:04.097 --> 00:15:08.540\nAnd once that's actually done,\nyou'll add them to the contact list.\n\n258\n00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.590\nFrom that point we are now\nready to send encrypted emails.\n\n259\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:13.650\n&gt;&gt; You nailed it Ronnie.\n\n260\n00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.660\nSo let's take a look at\nthe encryption piece now.\n\n261\n00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.520\nSo now that I've got Brian here,\nin my contacts,\n\n262\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.496\nwhen I go to send an email,\nsuper sensitive email,\n\n263\n00:15:26.496 --> 00:15:30.460\nwe're gonna go back to the Options tab.\n\n264\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.160\nAnd now,\nwe're gonna use the Encrypt option.\n\n265\n00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.650\nWe can also do the Sign option too.\n\n266\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:38.746\nBut I wanna just show you both of these.\n\n267\n00:15:38.746 --> 00:15:43.129\nWhen we do Sign and Encrypt,\nwe will go ahead and hit Send.\n\n268\n00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:46.910\nI just wanna to show\nyou what it looks here.\n\n269\n00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:52.569\nSo, we are gonna zoom back in and\nwe now have two different icons over here.\n\n270\n00:15:52.569 --> 00:15:56.731\nWe've got a lock, that indicates that\nthe data is encrypted and secure.\n\n271\n00:15:56.731 --> 00:16:00.784\nAnd, then we've got the little I call\nthat like a gold medal ribbon, and\n\n272\n00:16:00.784 --> 00:16:04.714\nthat indicates that it's actually\nbeen signed, so now we have both.\n\n273\n00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:08.971\n&gt;&gt; All right Brian, so\nthat sounds simple enough, you know,\n\n274\n00:16:08.971 --> 00:16:14.230\nto actually get the emails encrypted,\nso do we have anything else?\n\n275\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.906\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, couple more things.\n\n276\n00:16:15.906 --> 00:16:20.105\nI wanted to show, we showed you how to\nsign and encrypt, and I'm looking at\n\n277\n00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:24.656\nan email here, there's a small menu item,\nlet me make this smaller and zoom in.\n\n278\n00:16:24.656 --> 00:16:29.778\nWhere you can look at some of\nthe details of the configuration, and\n\n279\n00:16:29.778 --> 00:16:34.640\nit's under the Tags menu,\nwith this little arrow right here.\n\n280\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.829\nIt's going to be tough to see once\nI scroll back out and click it.\n\n281\n00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.800\nAnd when you come in here,\n\n282\n00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.670\nyou can go to security settings,\nand let's bring that back in.\n\n283\n00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.700\nSo here are the Security Properties,\nyou have a chain settings area.\n\n284\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.330\nSo if you had multiple\ncertificates on here, or if\n\n285\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.450\nyou wanted to do like a request nest mind\nreceipt for the message, there's a couple,\n\n286\n00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.979\njust more options here to manage this\nstuff and look at some of the details.\n\n287\n00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:10.587\nBeyond that, I think the last thing\nI wanna talk about is the impact\n\n288\n00:17:10.587 --> 00:17:14.850\nof S/MIME to the administration portion,\nright?\n\n289\n00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:18.220\nSo, there's a bunch of different\ntechnologies out there to do secure email,\n\n290\n00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.740\nencrypted email, S/MIME being one of them.\n\n291\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.630\nIt's a multi-platform, you know,\ntool agnostic technology,\n\n292\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.820\nbeen around a very long time.\n\n293\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.710\nWhat's nice about it is,\nusers can do it all by themselves.\n\n294\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.920\nGo out and acquire their own\nfree certificate, install it,\n\n295\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.990\nit doesn't require any rights,\nand just start encrypting email.\n\n296\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.010\nBut that's a problem sometimes in\na security organization, right?\n\n297\n00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.320\nBecause the IT staff doesn't know\nanything about the certificate,\n\n298\n00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.390\nthey don't know what's being sent\nout via that encrypted email, and\n\n299\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.290\nmost of their security software is\ngoing to be totally in the dark.\n\n300\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.440\nSo, normally email encryption is\nsomething, it's centrally handled,\n\n301\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.070\ncentrally managed, and\nyou know, supported by IT.\n\n302\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.890\nSo, that's one of the considerations.\n\n303\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:03.700\nLater we're going to talk about\na different option, using\n\n304\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.330\nWright's Management Services and IRM,\nthat's sort of a competitor to S/MIME.\n\n305\n00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.771\nSo I wanted to point out some of the\ndeficiencies of S/MIME, so that as we go\n\n306\n00:18:12.771 --> 00:18:17.366\ninto these next topics, you'll kind\nof be familiar with contrasting them.\n\n307\n00:18:17.366 --> 00:18:21.115\n&gt;&gt; Now, Brian, talking about\nthat administrative side then,\n\n308\n00:18:21.115 --> 00:18:24.287\nis there a way that we can\ndo some maybe group policy,\n\n309\n00:18:24.287 --> 00:18:27.360\nthat helps us to block\nsomething like this?\n\n310\n00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.130\nSo somebody doesn't just put\na certificate on there and go,\n\n311\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.560\nI'm gonna encrypt all of my\nemails that I've been sending or\n\n312\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.710\nbeen receiving,\nin case that person gets let go.\n\n313\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.930\nSo is there something we can\ndo to help control that?\n\n314\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere are a couple of things you can do.\n\n315\n00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.810\nThey're not all that easy, I mean.\n\n316\n00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.590\nFirst, part of it's gonna depend on\nwhether your users have administrative\n\n317\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.190\nrights to their computer,\nthat's one big one.\n\n318\n00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:58.720\nSecond, we do have group policy settings\nthat we can use to control Outlook,\n\n319\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.525\nand the Office suite, and then third,\nwe can make do transport rules and\n\n320\n00:19:02.525 --> 00:19:03.575\nsome monitoring.\n\n321\n00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:07.815\nSo, we can at least be aware of,\nif there's encrypted emails going out.\n\n322\n00:19:07.815 --> 00:19:09.295\nFor instance, in security software,\n\n323\n00:19:09.295 --> 00:19:13.155\nany virus software,\nstuff that scans messages for compliance.\n\n324\n00:19:13.155 --> 00:19:14.945\nThose are gonna be all left in the dark.\n\n325\n00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:17.655\nA lot of times you can configure\nthose pieces of software\n\n326\n00:19:17.655 --> 00:19:22.520\nto alert the administrator if email is\ngoing about that it can't scan, and\n\n327\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.260\nyou wanna aware of that staff.\n\n328\n00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:30.100\nAnd then final thought here, I know is a\nlot of information, but in a high security\n\n329\n00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:35.180\norganisation, where there is maybe\none person, maybe it's somebody\n\n330\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.262\non the legal team, or somebody else that's\ndoing something very, very, sensitive.\n\n331\n00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:42.120\nSometimes S/MIME is the right solution,\n\n332\n00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.550\nwhere even IT can't get in the data,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n333\n00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:51.000\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Brian, well thank you again\nfor helping us to think about the way to\n\n334\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.210\nplan out a type of security strategy\nthat we can actually use for Exchange.\n\n335\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.075\nRemember that when we took\na look at that here, of course,\n\n336\n00:19:58.075 --> 00:20:02.290\nis the idea of actually implementing\nBitLocker for a full drive encryption.\n\n337\n00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:06.620\nBrian did show us again, that when\nthe keys, if we have to use a password,\n\n338\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.730\nis to make sure that we have\nthat stored in a secure place.\n\n339\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.950\nAnd, Brian, actually,\none of our chat viewers mentioned,\n\n340\n00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:19.088\ndon't forget that we can actually use our\ndomain, or our active directory network,\n\n341\n00:20:19.088 --> 00:20:22.630\nso that BitLocker recovery keys can\nalso be stored in the active directory.\n\n342\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.730\nSo, that's a good reminder\nto think about as well.\n\n343\n00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.550\nAnd then of course, the use of S/MIME.\n\n344\n00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.260\nBrian took us through an example\nof how to get that set-up, but\n\n345\n00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.080\nas well as told us that\nthe benefits to that, and\n\n346\n00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.920\nas well as the warning,\nespecially on the administration side.\n\n347\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.740\nAnd you can imagine, that if there is a\ndisgruntled worker that decides, you know,\n\n348\n00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.310\nfrom now on I'm just gonna encrypt every\nsingle piece of mail that I get, and\n\n349\n00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.880\nif I get let go, the only way that I can\nget to it is if they come and beg me.\n\n350\n00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.520\nWell, that can be a problem as well, so,\nyou know, be aware, but at the same time\n\n351\n00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.890\nyou may find that there is a particular\nreason to allow that to happen, and\n\n352\n00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.614\nit is the right reason.\n\n353\n00:20:56.614 --> 00:20:58.400\nSo make sure you hang out to that too.\n\n354\n00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.540\nAll right Brian, thank you again, for\n\n355\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:06.070\nhelping us to think of these two topics,\nin a way, especially dealing with email.\n\n356\n00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.525\nAnd thank you, also, for watching.\n\n357\n00:21:08.525 -->

They show how to configure retention polices and create custom tag, then associate them together to be applied to users.  Brian demonstrates how the policies are applied by the Managed Folder Assistant and how to remove and delete tags.  The guys discuss the idea of using online archiving such as Office 365, mentioning the perquisites and considerations.  Lastly they create archive policies and configure in-place archiving.",

00:00:08.590\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.430\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\nyou're watching a show on configuring and\n\n6\n00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.160\nmanaging archiving And\nmessage records management.\n\n7\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.760\nThat's quite a mouthful Brian.\n\n8\n00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.480\nWhen we start to take a look at this we\nneed of course a better understanding and\n\n9\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.140\nthat's why we have our exchange expert\nright here, Mr. Brian Swedergahl.\n\n10\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.700\nBrian, welcome to our show and\nhelp us out with this topic here.\n\n11\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.850\nHow are we going to begin?\n\n12\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.810\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n13\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.970\nSo MRM for\n\n14\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.820\nshort, that's a little bit easier to say,\nis about trying to figure out\n\n15\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.260\nwhat you want to do with all of that email\ndata that's coming into your organization.\n\n16\n00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.050\nSome companies choose to do nothing with\nit, let the user decide whether they're\n\n17\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.970\ngoing to keep it or delete it, and then\nyou have some users keep things forever.\n\n18\n00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.110\nAnd then you have some users that\narchive it off to PST files or\n\n19\n00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.420\nsomething like that.\n\n20\n00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.790\nSo MRM is really centralizing the choice\nof what you do with all that email data.\n\n21\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.880\nAnd in many organizations,\n\n22\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.750\nthere's some sort of legal mandate,\nthere could be some compliance situation\n\n23\n00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.250\nthat dictates that you need to keep all\nemail for a certain period of time.\n\n24\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.740\nAnd in other organizations,\nnot quite as many There's\n\n25\n00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.210\nanother mandate that says well,\nwe're only going to keep email for\n\n26\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.390\nsay two years and our policy is\neverything gets deleted after that.\n\n27\n00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.050\nSo MOM can help us do those things.\n\n28\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.840\nToday we are going to start\nwith retention policies.\n\n29\n00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.770\nAnd you're going to see that these\ntopics sort of build on each other.\n\n30\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280\nSo we're going to start\nwith retention policies\n\n31\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.190\nTension policies are basically\na collection of tags and\n\n32\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.590\ntags are what dictate what we're\ngonna do with that email data.\n\n33\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.670\nSo let's go and get started right\nhere at the PowerShell prompt and\n\n34\n00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.458\nshow you how to work with these things.\n\n35\n00:01:57.458 --> 00:02:00.179\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n36\n00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe're on mailbox server number one.\n\n37\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.030\nAnd we are gonna create\na new retention policy and\n\n38\n00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.470\nwe're gonna name this one Executives.\n\n39\n00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.440\nI wanna show you what's interesting here.\n\n40\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.590\nThink of this as like a lot of things\nthat we've seen earlier and exchanged or\n\n41\n00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.540\neven in active directory where you create\nan object, say a group policy object.\n\n42\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.360\nBut until you take further action,\nthis actually doesn't do anything.\n\n43\n00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.010\nWe have a new retention policy here but\nthere’s no tags linked with it.\n\n44\n00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.290\nOur next topic we're going\nto build on this and\n\n45\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.490\neventually we're going to end\nup with a full feature solution.\n\n46\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.870\nSo, we've got this retention policy and we\ncan take a look at all retention policy.\n\n47\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.268\nBy just looking at\nthe git-RetentionPolicy.\n\n48\n00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:51.610\nI want to show you\na couple of things here.\n\n49\n00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.930\nOne is that we've got\na default MRM policy.\n\n50\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.470\nSo, that one's, that one's built in,\nonce you install Exchange, and\n\n51\n00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.020\nit's got a bunch of tag\nlinks that you can see here.\n\n52\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.969\nLike, never delete, 5 year delete,\n1 year delete, a bunch of different tags\n\n53\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.550\nWe've got a couple of other ones that I've\ncreated, a sales one, one that's specific\n\n54\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.500\nto Tom, retention forever, and then\nthe one we just created for executive.\n\n55\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.640\nthe thing you'll see down here at the\nbottom, for these two, there are no tags,\n\n56\n00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.410\nSo we're going to get to that coming up\nnext here All right, so when we start\n\n57\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.570\ntaking a look at this idea of the tagging,\nwe may have to actually plan and also\n\n58\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.770\nthink about some custom tagging, right,\nnot just the ones that we see right there.\n\n59\n00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n60\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.580\nYou can get by with the default tags\ndepending on what your requirements are.\n\n61\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.520\nSo it's important to\nknow that they're there.\n\n62\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.230\nBut for most organizations You wanna\ncreate some custom tags based on whatever\n\n63\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.220\nindustry your in and whatever compliance\nstandards that you guys have set.\n\n64\n00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.470\nSo lets look at creating tags and\nthen associating them with a policy.\n\n65\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.480\nSo we are gonna do an new\nretention Policy tag.\n\n66\n00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.030\nThis one, we're gonna call legal.\n\n67\n00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.450\nWe're gonna specify a type of all.\n\n68\n00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.450\nAnd type of all,\nyou can have several different types.\n\n69\n00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.800\nThe type is basically\nwhere this tag applies.\n\n70\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.840\nIt can be just to the inbox or\njust to the deleted items folder.\n\n71\n00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.600\nOr if you specify or\nit covers the entire mail box.\n\n72\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.230\nThen we're gonna say RetentionEnabled\n\n73\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.080\nis true and Agent for retention is 1825.\n\n74\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.380\nThat is in days So\nthat's going to be about five years.\n\n75\n00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.850\nAnd then we choose an action.\n\n76\n00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.420\nAnd in this case we're going to\nsay delete and allow recovery.\n\n77\n00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.120\nSo that's one of three potential actions,\nright.\n\n78\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.400\nThe other is you can move\nthe data to the archive.\n\n79\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.240\nAnd you can only move data to the archive\nif you actually have an archive mailbox.\n\n80\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.260\nWe're gonna take a look at archiving\na little bit later in this segment.\n\n81\n00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.670\nAnd then the last one\nis permanently delete.\n\n82\n00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.390\nSo DeleteAndAllowRecovery\nmeans it's gonna be deleted.\n\n83\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.990\nBut as an administrator\nyou can recover it.\n\n84\n00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.530\nPermanentlyDelete means it's gone\nunless you have it backed up.\n\n85\n00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.040\nNow Brian are there other different\ntypes of retention tags as well?\n\n86\n00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.340\nYou already showed us some\nlike a default policy.\n\n87\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.780\nIs there default tag or anything else\nbesides this retention tag policy?\n\n88\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.220\n&gt;&gt; There is a concept of personal tag.\n\n89\n00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.120\nSo What we're showing you right now\nare tags that are applied at the backend\n\n90\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.100\nby the system to mandate and\ncontrol how that email data.\n\n91\n00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.580\nBut there's also a concept\nto personal tag and\n\n92\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.810\nthose are ones that the user can use to\nmark individual items in their mailbox.\n\n93\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.310\nSo while a default tab or maybe a tab\non the back end specifies it would\n\n94\n00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.470\nnormally want to keep something for\nsay 30 days or 60 days.\n\n95\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.210\nThe user might say, well actually this is\nkind of a critical piece of information,\n\n96\n00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.150\nI wanna keep this one longer or\nI wanna reclassify it, right.\n\n97\n00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.030\nSo that's personal tags.\n\n98\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.870\nExcellent\n&gt;&gt; Let me hit Enter and\n\n99\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.900\nget this one going.\n\n100\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.170\nSo, up to this point,\n\n101\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.160\nwe've got a Retention Policy and\nnow we have a Retention Policy Tag.\n\n102\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.580\nNow we are going to associate this\nTag with that Retention Policy.\n\n103\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.610\nSo, we're gonna do\na Set-RetentionPolicy Executives,\n\n104\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.360\nwhich what we created\na couple minutes ago.\n\n105\n00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.780\nAnd then we specified the tag links.\n\n106\n00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.570\nThis one is named legal.\n\n107\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.510\nAnd now,\nif we go back to git-RetentionPolicy,\n\n108\n00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:53.020\nyou can see right down here at the bottom\nthat our legal tag is now associated.\n\n109\n00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.170\nThey call it linked All right, so Brian,\n\n110\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.800\nlet's make sure that we\nhave this concept down.\n\n111\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.310\nFirst we might need to go ahead and\nmake sure that we create that policy and\n\n112\n00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.130\nthen we have to create the tag and\nthen associate them together, right?\n\n113\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n114\n00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.760\n&gt;&gt; So we've got our policy,\nwe've got a tag, we've got some action for\n\n115\n00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.100\nthis thing to do.\n\n116\n00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.500\nThe next step really is to associate\nthis with a mailbox, right.\n\n117\n00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.680\nBecause even though we\nhave put this in place\n\n118\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.690\nit's not applying anywhere\n\n119\n00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.630\n&gt;&gt; So\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n120\n00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.540\n&gt;&gt; So, the idea then is\n\n121\n00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.380\nnow that we have everything that we,\n\n122\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.650\nyou know put it in placed\n&gt;&gt; We now need to associate to a single\n\n123\n00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.460\nuser, is that what has to happen?\n\n124\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.770\nOr can we associate this\nto a group of users?\n\n125\n00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:41.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, normally you associate\nit with a large chunk of users.\n\n126\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now, in special circumstances you\n\n127\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.520\nmight associate this with a single user,\n\n128\n00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.560\nyou got a certain\n&gt;&gt; legal or compliance situation.\n\n129\n00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.984\nWe're going to look a little bit\nat something called legal holds,\n\n130\n00:07:51.984 --> 00:07:54.501\nwhich are usually applied\nto individual users.\n\n131\n00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:58.692\nBut in this case these policies are meant\nto be applied to large chunks of users.\n\n132\n00:07:58.692 --> 00:08:02.042\nAnd in many cases,\nthe entire organization.\n\n133\n00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:04.956\n&gt;&gt; So, Brian, show us how to make sure\nthat we can get this now applied to\n\n134\n00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:07.050\nthe users that we need to.\n\n135\n00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.278\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's go back to the command prompt here,\n\n136\n00:08:10.278 --> 00:08:14.734\nthe PowerShell prompt, and we are going\nto choose our friend, Jack Jackson.\n\n137\n00:08:14.734 --> 00:08:17.405\nWe're going to use\nthe Set-Mailbox commandlet.\n\n138\n00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:20.998\nWe're gonna say for Jack.Jackson, and\n\n139\n00:08:20.998 --> 00:08:25.720\nwe're gonna use\nthe RetentionPolicy parameter, and\n\n140\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:31.681\nthen we just specify the name of\nthe RetentionPolicy, Executives.\n\n141\n00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:36.340\nAnd there we have it.\n\n142\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.360\nSo what I wanna show you though,\n\n143\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.190\nlet's get outside of PowerShell and let's\nget to the Exchange administrative center.\n\n144\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.110\nAnd go over to recipients, and\n\n145\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.970\nwe're gonna scroll down to there's\nJack Jackson, right there.\n\n146\n00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.720\nInside here,\nyou can also see the Retention policy.\n\n147\n00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.090\nSo we're showing a lot of\nPowerShell throughout, but\n\n148\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.620\nI wanna pop in here to the GUI as well,\njust so you can see all the stuff we're\n\n149\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.810\ndoing, you can do it in PowerShell, or\nin the administrative interface here.\n\n150\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.449\nHere's the Retention policy,\nright here, Executives.\n\n151\n00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.760\nAnd anyway, so just be aware that\nyou can do it in both places and\n\n152\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.550\nit's kind of easy sometimes\nto look in the GUI.\n\n153\n00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.100\n&gt;&gt; Now the other aspect of what else we\nwant to cover here, in terms of the MRM,\n\n154\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.380\nis also being able to plan and\nconfigure Managed Folder Assistant.\n\n155\n00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.670\nWhat is that we need to\nto kind of plan out here?\n\n156\n00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.820\n&gt;&gt; So the Managed Folder Assistant\nis really the backend process\n\n157\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:43.390\nthat runs on the Exchange servers to\ntake action based on your configuration,\n\n158\n00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:48.600\nand this is one of those\nprocesses that is always running.\n\n159\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.330\nAnd it's based on the load on\nthe mail servers themselves.\n\n160\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:58.110\nSo it's just always back there,\nyou can fire it off manually if desired,\n\n161\n00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.580\nand I'm gonna walk through\na scenario in just a minute on that.\n\n162\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.370\nSo let's take a look at the computer and\nwalk through a couple things real quick.\n\n163\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.530\nSo we're gonna go back to PowerShell.\n\n164\n00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:15.130\nSo like I say, this Managed Folder\nAssistant's always running, but\n\n165\n00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:20.030\nif we want to kick it off, we can, and\nhere's when you would wanna do that.\n\n166\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.090\nLet's pretend that I\nhave a group of users and\n\n167\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.600\nthey haven't been under any retention or\nMRM settings at all.\n\n168\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.980\nThey've got huge mailboxes.\n\n169\n00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.310\nWe finally say you know what,\nwe gotta reel this in, and\n\n170\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.740\nwe set up some tags and some links.\n\n171\n00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.620\nAnd now instead of waiting for this thing\nto run through over a period of time,\n\n172\n00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.820\nwe want to kick it off now and\nhave it processing mailboxes right now.\n\n173\n00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.710\nThat's when you use\nthe Start-ManagedFolderAssistant command.\n\n174\n00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.720\nYou don't get any feedback back from it,\nas long as you don't see any\n\n175\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.430\nerror messages then it has\nsuccessfully kicked off.\n\n176\n00:10:56.468 --> 00:11:00.160\nNow I wanna show you, let me clear this,\nI wanna switch gears just a little bit.\n\n177\n00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.180\nWe talked about a retention hold, so\nimagine that you've got these policies in\n\n178\n00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.040\nplace that are either archiving messages\nor deleting messages on thefly,\n\n179\n00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.050\nand you've got somebody going on,\nsay, maternity leave.\n\n180\n00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.010\nAnd maybe they're gonna be gone for\nsix months.\n\n181\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.090\nImagine that when they get back,\nthe Managed Folder Assistant has taken\n\n182\n00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.750\nall their stuff and either gotten rid\nof it or moved it to the archive.\n\n183\n00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.350\nNot a good situation, right?\n\n184\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:32.080\nSo, we can actually put retention on hold,\nand let's see how we do that.\n\n185\n00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.131\nSo we're gonna do Set-Mailbox again.\n\n186\n00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:38.520\nWe're gonna specify Jack.Jackson.\n\n187\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.590\nThen we're gonna use the RetentionHold,\nwhere are you, Enabled.\n\n188\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:51.870\nWe're gonna set that to true, and\nthen we're gonna pick the dates.\n\n189\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.885\nSo, StartDateForRetentionHold,\nlet's go 3/14/2017.\n\n190\n00:11:54.885 --> 00:11:59.529\nAnd then the end date,\nwhen they're coming back,\n\n191\n00:11:59.529 --> 00:12:06.560\nthey're coming back on the last day of\nthe year, and let's get a 7 in there.\n\n192\n00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.350\nSo, now our retention is on hold.\n\n193\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.030\nThat means that\nthe Managed Folder Assistant is\n\n194\n00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.330\nnot gonna take any action\nbetween those specified dates.\n\n195\n00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.690\nOkay, moving on,\n\n196\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.191\nI wanna show you one more thing with\nregard to Managed Folder Assistant.\n\n197\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:28.418\nAnd we're gonna do Set-MailboxServer,\nMBX1,\n\n198\n00:12:28.418 --> 00:12:34.110\nwhere we are now,\nManagedFolderAssistantSchedule.\n\n199\n00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.158\nSo, here's the deal.\n\n200\n00:12:35.158 --> 00:12:40.061\nI'm not gonna type out the complete\ncommand because it's fairly complex, but\n\n201\n00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:44.650\nwhat I wanted to show is that you can\nset a managed folder assistant schedule\n\n202\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.110\nto have this thing run off-hours.\n\n203\n00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.110\nOn only certain days of the week,\nor whenever you really specify.\n\n204\n00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.570\nSo normally it's running all\nthe time in the background, but\n\n205\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.530\nif you wanted something different,\nyou can control it like this.\n\n206\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.542\nAnd this is a per-server configuration, so\nyou'd run this on every mailbox server.\n\n207\n00:13:01.542 --> 00:13:05.690\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian, after actually\nseeing this, is there a reason for\n\n208\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.160\nus to ever really change\nthe default settings here?\n\n209\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.010\nWhere it's running on both the actual\nuser itself, on their particular policy,\n\n210\n00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.410\nas well as the mailbox,\njust like you showed us?\n\n211\n00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, here's the deal with that.\n\n212\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.530\nI always go for the Managed Folder\nAssistant with the default settings\n\n213\n00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.320\nunless there's something unusual\nthat makes me wanna change it.\n\n214\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:32.590\nI've got a really busy email server, or\nI want to offload all this processing to,\n\n215\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.300\nsay, a weekend, because I'm about to\nonboard a whole bunch of people for MRM.\n\n216\n00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.930\n&gt;&gt; Now, Brian, within an organization,\nmaybe what we end up seeing\n\n217\n00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.610\nare mailboxes or people that end\nup changing out of those groups,\n\n218\n00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.090\nlike what we had assigned a little\nbit earlier to the executives.\n\n219\n00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.080\nIs there a way that we can\nnow remove also those tags or\n\n220\n00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.350\nchange them in the way that we need to?\n\n221\n00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so as part of managing MRN,\nyou're gonna create policies,\n\n222\n00:13:57.945 --> 00:14:02.420\nyou're gonna create tags, but\nyou are also gonna remove these items too.\n\n223\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.192\nSo let's take a look at how you can\ndo that from the command prompt here.\n\n224\n00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:11.530\nSo we've got a tag named Legal.\n\n225\n00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:16.027\nWe're gonna use\nthe Remove-RetentionPolicyTag, and\n\n226\n00:14:16.027 --> 00:14:18.375\nwe're gonna specify legal.\n\n227\n00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:29.290\nAnd you'll notice that we get this,\nAre you sure, and we're gonna hit Yes.\n\n228\n00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.010\nSo, here's the deal.\n\n229\n00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.620\nAfter you delete it, then the Managed\nFolder Assistant will go back to all\n\n230\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.380\nthe items that were stamped with Legal and\nremove that stamp, or\n\n231\n00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:46.120\nstamp on whatever other tags should apply.\n\n232\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.280\nSo it's important that we\ngo through this process.\n\n233\n00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.440\nAnd then we need to let the Managed\nFolder Assistant run through the whole\n\n234\n00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.252\nseries of mailboxes.\n\n235\n00:14:52.252 --> 00:14:56.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nnow that we have that, now Brian,\n\n236\n00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:02.660\ndoes this also affect,\nI'm trying to make sure I say this right.\n\n237\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:08.630\nIf we remove these tags, and it's in the\nmiddle, in process of, let's say, applying\n\n238\n00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.970\nthese tags, is that gonna affect anything\nand cause any issues with incoming mail?\n\n239\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.146\nSo let's say that we decide to\ndo this during business hour and\n\n240\n00:15:16.146 --> 00:15:19.670\ngo, let me just remove this, and\nwe're expecting it to come in.\n\n241\n00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.635\nIs that gonna cause any\nkind of disruption?\n\n242\n00:15:21.635 --> 00:15:25.260\n&gt;&gt; No, this is something that\nyou can actually work with\n\n243\n00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.454\nin the middle of the day\nwithout a change window.\n\n244\n00:15:27.454 --> 00:15:32.060\nYou're not gonna cause any disruption\nto mail flow or mail access.\n\n245\n00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:38.730\nMost of this MRM stuff is not\nreal-time and not impacting.\n\n246\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.606\nThere's always exceptions, of course.\n\n247\n00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:45.769\n&gt;&gt; Since everybody is seemingly\nmoving also to Office 365,\n\n248\n00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:50.258\nwhat are some of the prerequisites\nalso then for the archiving and\n\n249\n00:15:50.258 --> 00:15:54.599\nstuff that we need when we start\nmoving towards Office 365?\n\n250\n00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:55.413\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good question, Ronnie.\n\n251\n00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:58.746\nSo Here's the deal with archiving.\n\n252\n00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:01.200\nWe've mentioned that you can\ncreate archive mailboxes.\n\n253\n00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.052\nAnd you can use the MRM to move items into\nan archive mailbox if you wanna keep them\n\n254\n00:16:06.052 --> 00:16:06.810\nlong term.\n\n255\n00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:10.610\nWhat we haven't talked about yet is,\nwhere can you keep the archive mailboxes?\n\n256\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.942\nBy default, they go on-premises,\nand that's a good place for them.\n\n257\n00:16:14.942 --> 00:16:17.930\nBut you can also put\nthem up in Office 365.\n\n258\n00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.600\nAnd you can mix and match.\n\n259\n00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.780\nSo you can have a primary\nmailbox on-premises and\n\n260\n00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.210\nan archive mailbox in Office 365.\n\n261\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.150\nThat offloads a lot of\nthe storage consideration.\n\n262\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.565\nBut to do that,\nlet's talk through those requirements.\n\n263\n00:16:32.565 --> 00:16:35.410\nSo there are two main requirements really.\n\n264\n00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:39.290\nWe need to be in a hybrid\nconfiguration with Office 365.\n\n265\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.950\nWe're gonna talk a little bit about\nthe hybrid configuration in later topics.\n\n266\n00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.198\nI don't know if that's today or tomorrow.\n\n267\n00:16:44.198 --> 00:16:45.900\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n268\n00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.950\nBut the hybrid configuration\nrequires two things.\n\n269\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:55.630\nYou need to have direct resynchronization\nand an organization relationship.\n\n270\n00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.641\nAnd I think we'll cover both those\ntopics as well in the near future.\n\n271\n00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:00.179\nSo stay tuned for those.\n\n272\n00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:05.045\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what are some additional\nconsiderations that we have to think about\n\n273\n00:17:05.045 --> 00:17:10.360\nof whether we're gonna archive the mailbox\non-premises or going into the cloud?\n\n274\n00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.690\nSo how do we decide which\none's gonna be best for us?\n\n275\n00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:19.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the number one thing I think\nabout is the consumption of bandwidth.\n\n276\n00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.198\nThere's two key considerations\nwith the bandwidth.\n\n277\n00:17:22.198 --> 00:17:26.870\nOne is when you first put your\narchive mailboxes in the cloud.\n\n278\n00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.720\nIf you've got a couple thousand users and\nyou put a couple thousand archive\n\n279\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.140\nmailboxes out in the cloud, how much data\ndo you need to get out there initially?\n\n280\n00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:39.070\nHow long is that gonna take and\nhow impactful that gonna be\n\n281\n00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.150\nto your environment?\n\n282\n00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.790\nAnd then ongoing, how much data are you\nsending to the archive mailboxes?\n\n283\n00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:51.020\nIn some organizations, every time a new\nemail comes in, an old email goes out.\n\n284\n00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.389\nAnd so in a situation like that with\narchive mailboxes in the cloud,\n\n285\n00:17:54.389 --> 00:17:56.720\nit can be fairly bandwidth intensive.\n\n286\n00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.349\nSo you wanna take that into consideration\nas you're going through your planning.\n\n287\n00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Now, once we have everything configured\nfor the MRM the way that we need to.\n\n288\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:10.566\nDoes this just work or is there any other\nthings that we have to worry about?\n\n289\n00:18:10.566 --> 00:18:18.430\n&gt;&gt; So I think you might be alluding to our\nnext topic, which is archive policies.\n\n290\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.400\nAnd so far, we've talked about MRM.\n\n291\n00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.500\nAnd we've talked really about retention\nholds, deleting items and stuff.\n\n292\n00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.957\nBut now we're getting\nmore into the archiving.\n\n293\n00:18:27.957 --> 00:18:30.418\nWhich is, hey,\nwe wanna keep messages around.\n\n294\n00:18:30.418 --> 00:18:33.100\nAnd we wanna keep them in\nour archive mailboxes.\n\n295\n00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.549\nSo let's take a look at the computer and\nsee how we can work with these things.\n\n296\n00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:43.634\nLet's clear this.\n\n297\n00:18:43.634 --> 00:18:49.856\nWe're gonna go\nNew-RetentionPolicyTag Name.\n\n298\n00:18:49.856 --> 00:18:55.263\nAnd we're gonna go Jack's archive tag,\na personal tag.\n\n299\n00:18:55.263 --> 00:19:00.520\n-Type All AgeLimitForRetention 365.\n\n300\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.080\nBut this time,\nwe're gonna do the MoveToArchive.\n\n301\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.300\nIf you remember earlier,\nI talked about there being three actions.\n\n302\n00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.170\nOne was a permanent deletion.\n\n303\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.360\nOne was a deletion but allow recovery.\n\n304\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.390\nThis is that third one, MoveToArchive.\n\n305\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:19.834\nAnd this action is what dictates\nthat these are archive policies.\n\n306\n00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:22.560\nSo that's the differentiator there.\n\n307\n00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.021\nSo that is now in place, RetentionPolicy.\n\n308\n00:19:27.021 --> 00:19:36.660\nWe're gonna call this\nRetentionPolicy-Archive for Jack.\n\n309\n00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.420\nRetentionPolicyTagLinks, this should look\nsemi familiar to you guys from earlier.\n\n310\n00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.940\nSo we're associating the policy\nwith the policy tag.\n\n311\n00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:50.957\nAnd then, finally, we're gonna do\nthe Set-Mailbox Jack.Jackson so\n\n312\n00:19:50.957 --> 00:19:53.838\nthat we can apply this thing.\n\n313\n00:19:53.838 --> 00:19:59.369\nRetentionPolicy, and then we specify\n\n314\n00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:05.920\nthe name RetentionPolicy-Archive-Jack.\n\n315\n00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.370\nSo there you have it.\n\n316\n00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.196\nArchive policies, even though it\nlooks like a totally new thing,\n\n317\n00:20:11.196 --> 00:20:14.969\nit's really a retention policy\nwith the move to archive action.\n\n318\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.260\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nwhen we start talking about archiving,\n\n319\n00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.010\nwe also still need to plan for\nin-place archiving as well.\n\n320\n00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:23.851\nAnd Brian, you're gonna help\n\n321\n00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:25.250\nus to understand this a little bit better,\nright?\n\n322\n00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I am, so\nhere's the interesting thing.\n\n323\n00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.920\nWe've created a policy that says, hey,\narchive items based on this configuration.\n\n324\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.150\nBut we also actually\nneed archive mailboxes.\n\n325\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.400\nAnd up till now,\nwe've been working with primary mailboxes.\n\n326\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.375\nBut there's the concept\nof an archive mailbox.\n\n327\n00:20:44.375 --> 00:20:50.210\nWhich is a secondary mailbox specifically\nset up to take on these archive messages.\n\n328\n00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.150\nSo let's drop down to the computer and\ntake a look.\n\n329\n00:20:55.723 --> 00:20:58.130\nSo let me clear this.\n\n330\n00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.820\nWe're gonna do an Enable-Mailbox.\n\n331\n00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.160\nYou guys might remember\nthis cmdlet from yesterday.\n\n332\n00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.600\nIn this case, we're gonna go Ken.Jones.\n\n333\n00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.520\nAnd we're gonna specify Archive.\n\n334\n00:21:09.925 --> 00:21:13.795\nThere it is, Archive.\n\n335\n00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:14.940\nKen.Jones couldn't be found.\n\n336\n00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:21.294\nWell, let's do a get-mailbox and\nfind another candidate.\n\n337\n00:21:23.659 --> 00:21:24.823\nAha, there is Ken.\n\n338\n00:21:24.823 --> 00:21:29.272\nSo Ken Jones actually is Ken and\nnot Ken.Jones in my standard.\n\n339\n00:21:29.272 --> 00:21:32.380\nI went away from my corporate standards,\nnot cool.\n\n340\n00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:39.950\nLet's try this again with just\nthe actual alias name for Ken.\n\n341\n00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:40.919\nAnd that works.\n\n342\n00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:44.130\nSo I should change that later maybe.\n\n343\n00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:47.510\nSo now, Ken's got an archive mailbox.\n\n344\n00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.230\nLet's take a look at\nviewing that real quick.\n\n345\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.280\nWe're gonna look at archive specifically.\n\n346\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.460\nAnd so you can see we didn't\nspecify an archive database.\n\n347\n00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.850\nSo it picked one out, DB10.\n\n348\n00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.340\nAnd it shows you the in-place\narchive right there is the name.\n\n349\n00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:12.020\nAnd then it has the default quota on\nthere, 100 GB with the warning at 90 GB.\n\n350\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.069\nYou can change that,\nbut that's the default.\n\n351\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.090\nAnd then, finally, I'll show you, you\ncan view all of the archive mailboxes in\n\n352\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:25.227\nthe organization by just doing\nthe get-mailbox -Archive.\n\n353\n00:22:25.227 --> 00:22:27.740\nAnd that archive specification,\n\n354\n00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:33.030\nit's the same thing that we saw\nearlier with public folder or others.\n\n355\n00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:33.960\nIt's fairly flexible.\n\n356\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Brian, I believe\nthat that's actually the last topic that\n\n357\n00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.860\nwe need to cover in this particular\nsection of taking a look at the MRM and\n\n358\n00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.340\nthe archiving here.\n\n359\n00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.055\nRemember that what you took a look at in\nthis episode is to talk about the idea\n\n360\n00:22:50.055 --> 00:22:53.905\nof configuring, of course, the retention\npolicies and planning for them.\n\n361\n00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:57.862\nBrian also emphasized the fact that not\nonly do we need to create those policies,\n\n362\n00:22:57.862 --> 00:22:59.910\nbut the tags, associate them together.\n\n363\n00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.175\nAnd then, of course,\n\n364\n00:23:01.175 --> 00:23:06.090\nmake sure that users have access to them\nby associating those together as well.\n\n365\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.750\nHe also helped us here in taking a look\nat the managed folder assistant.\n\n366\n00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.500\nAnd getting that ready to work\nwith what we were talking about.\n\n367\n00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.390\nAs well as how to remove those tags and\ndelete those tags when we need to, too.\n\n368\n00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.970\nAnd then because of the way\nthat the world is going.\n\n369\n00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:25.653\nAnd Office 365 is a consideration for\nmoving or archiving there or\n\n370\n00:23:25.653 --> 00:23:27.033\nto somewhere else.\n\n371\n00:23:27.033 --> 00:23:29.820\nRemember that we want\nto take look at that.\n\n372\n00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.480\nAs well as,\n\n373\n00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.530\nof course, creating some different\narchive policies that we have in place.\n\n374\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.860\nAs well as configuring\nthe in-place archiving.\n\n375\n00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:44.250\nWhich is storing that archive along with\nthe mailbox, if I remember correctly.\n\n376\n00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.500\nSo there's a lot of information here.\n\n377\n00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.030\nNow, Brian, again, since we have\njust a couple of minutes here.\n\n378\n00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.980\nWhen it comes down to getting ready for\n\n379\n00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.510\nthe exam, best way to try and\npractice some of these things.\n\n380\n00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:02.384\nWhat do we need to think about in terms of\njust getting this set into our minds and\n\n381\n00:24:02.384 --> 00:24:03.900\nready for the exam?\n\n382\n00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:09.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is one of those\ntopics that's tough in a home lab.\n\n383\n00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.150\nHowever, if you do have a home lab you\ncan certainly flip this stuff on and\n\n384\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.280\ngo through it.\n\n385\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.310\nIf you don't, in Office 365,\nat least from the end user perspective,\n\n386\n00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.810\nyou can gain access to some\nof the MRM available there.\n\n387\n00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.347\nAnd work with it from an end\nuser perspective in Outlook and\n\n388\n00:24:26.347 --> 00:24:27.726\nsee how it functions.\n\n389\n00:24:27.726 --> 00:24:30.261\nSo that can be helpful for the exam.\n\n390\n00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:36.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, that's a great place\nfor us to also end this episode then.\n\n391\n00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:40.360\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n392\n00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.630\n&gt;&gt; And I\"m Brian Svidergol.\n\n393\n00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.460\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Microsoft Exchange 2016

00:00:12.760\nYour watching ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome\n\n4\n00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.000\nto another great episode\nright here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.600\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today\nyou’re watching the idea of planning and\n\n6\n00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.430\nof course configuring and performing.\n\n7\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.230\nediscovery, and here to help us out is\nour Exchange expert, Mr. Brian Svidergol.\n\n8\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.640\nBrian, welcome to our show and\nhelp us to get started here on ediscovery.\n\n9\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Sure, thanks, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.210\nSo ediscovery,\nlet's quickly define what it is.\n\n11\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.340\nRefresher for some of you.\n\n12\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.980\nSo ediscovery enables administrators or\n\n13\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.950\nwhoever else has been designated\nthe proper rights to be able\n\n14\n00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.210\nto search all the organizations\nmailboxes for specified data.\n\n15\n00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.510\nIt could be related to a legal case or\nsome kind of compliance search.\n\n16\n00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750\nIt could be related to an audit.\n\n17\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.630\nMaybe a security incident, it's typically\none of those areas dictates, if somebody's\n\n18\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.790\ngotta search the entire organization for\nmessages that meet certain criteria.\n\n19\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.080\nSo that's the whole concept of eDiscovery.\n\n20\n00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n21\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.580\nBrian when we get into what types\nof role based access control roles\n\n22\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.290\ndo we need to make sure when we start\nhaving to do something like eDiscovery?\n\n23\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.510\nAnd interesting thing with Exchange and\nwe've seen it a couple of times so far.\n\n24\n00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.410\nIs that even though you might be\na full Exchange Administrator.\n\n25\n00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.830\nThere's certain tasks that\nyou can't do out of the box\n\n26\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.500\nwithout using some of the built-in\nrules that come with Exchange.\n\n27\n00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.670\nSo this happens to be one of them.\n\n28\n00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.850\nYou can't do E Discovery as a full\nExchange Administer instead\n\n29\n00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.950\nyou need to be designated a specific role.\n\n30\n00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.586\nLets take a look at how you can do that.\n\n31\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.240\nWe're gonna go to mailbox server number\none lets clear off the past stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.920\nAnd in this case we're gonna make Tom our\ne-discovery guy, add role group member.\n\n33\n00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.630\nIdentity, the particular identity is\ngoing to be Discovery Management,\n\n34\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.490\nand that is what's gonna give\nTom everything he needs.\n\n35\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.880\nLet's take a look here.\n\n36\n00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.190\nOkay, so Add-RoleGroupMember.\n\n37\n00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.090\nWe've seen this one before.\n\n38\n00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.130\nThe only thing different here is that\nwe're specifying Discovery Management and\n\n39\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.800\nthat one is key to performing e-discovery.\n\n40\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.380\nSo, at this point forward, Tom is now able\nto do those searches we talked about.\n\n41\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.500\nNow Brian, we also then,\nonce we get this rolling [INAUDIBLE].\n\n42\n00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.440\nWe need to enable something that we call\na legal hold or a litigation hold here.\n\n43\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.890\nWhat is that about?\n\n44\n00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.960\n&gt;&gt; So a legal hold or\n\n45\n00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.440\na litigation hold is,\nlet's pretend that you have a legal case.\n\n46\n00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.060\nThere's something going on with\nthe organization, maybe there's a lawsuit.\n\n47\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.250\nAnd we find out maybe it's in\ninvolving the sales organization.\n\n48\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.650\nAnd so, the legal team at\nthe organization says, hey, listen.\n\n49\n00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.510\nFor right now, we need to place\nall email data on hold for\n\n50\n00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.390\nthe sales organization so\nthat it can't be deleted, altered, or\n\n51\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.600\notherwise changed while we're\nsorting through this Legal scenario.\n\n52\n00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.240\n&gt;&gt; Now, Brian, in a previous episode, we\nhad just talked about retention policies.\n\n53\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.020\nIs a legal hold a type of retention\npolicy, or is it something different?\n\n54\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.090\n&gt;&gt; It's a little bit different.\n\n55\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.090\nThink of legal hold, and\nnow we're calling them litigation holds\n\n56\n00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.690\nAs a more serious and\nmore permanent type of hole.\n\n57\n00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.500\nRetention is all about,\nhey we want to keep this data around or\n\n58\n00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.550\nwe want to delete it,\nmaybe we want to archive it.\n\n59\n00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.080\nOn the label side it's really\nwe have to keep it around.\n\n60\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.180\nAnd I want to point out something\nabout these illegal holds When you\n\n61\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.400\nset a user for a legal hold, litigation\nhold the user's totally unaware.\n\n62\n00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.020\nSo in the background we're\nkeeping all of that data\n\n63\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.120\nbased on the settings that we specify.\n\n64\n00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.080\nEven if the users goes and deletes email\nor tries to bypass any of the policies\n\n65\n00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.010\nwe put in place all that data's\ngonna remain and we're good there.\n\n66\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.330\nAll right so Brian what do we need to do\nto make sure that we've got this enabled\n\n67\n00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.460\nwhen we're called upon to do it?\n\n68\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.480\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at\nthe PowerShell prompt here and,\n\n69\n00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.250\nlet's set somebody up for it.\n\n70\n00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.390\nSo Set-Mailbox,\nwe're gonna go back to our buddy Jack.\n\n71\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.680\nAnd we gonna reset mail box with the\nlitigation hold the enabled set to true.\n\n72\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.520\nNow this particular command\nwill settle litigation hold for\n\n73\n00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.350\njust Jack Jackson's mail box and\nthe hold is gonna be indefinite.\n\n74\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.800\nYou gonna see a warn that may take\nup to 60 minutes to take effect.\n\n75\n00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.950\nSo be aware of that if\nyou know you hear some\n\n76\n00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.080\nsituations out there with an emergency\nsituation to get this holes in place,\n\n77\n00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.740\nyou might have the users\nscrambling to get rid of the data,\n\n78\n00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.960\njust be aware that it can take\n60 minutes to take a fact.\n\n79\n00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.870\nNow Brian since we just also\nconfigured that I can't remember which\n\n80\n00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.630\naccount you configured for\nthe discovery management role.\n\n81\n00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.920\nDo they have to actually be in that\ngroup before you can run this command?\n\n82\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.980\n&gt;&gt; So the command that we just ran,\nthe set-mailbox, no.\n\n83\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.600\nThat's gonna be the exchange\nadministrator that can run that command.\n\n84\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.030\nI wanna show you a couple more too.\n\n85\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.590\nBut Tom now is able to run\nthe eDiscovery searches unless he has\n\n86\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.080\nspecific exchange admin rights in\naddition to discovery management,\n\n87\n00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.650\nthen all he can do is\nthe eDiscovery stuff.\n\n88\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.920\nLet's go back to the command prompt and\nfinish out this one topic here.\n\n89\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.020\nSo we're going to get\nmailbox Jack dot Jackson.\n\n90\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.690\nAnd we're gonna get all\nthe properties from my list and\n\n91\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.060\nlook at everything related to relegation.\n\n92\n00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.060\nAnd what we can see is litigation\nhold enabled the date that\n\n93\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.220\nwe enabled that to hold owner nd that's\nthe person that implement and that's me.\n\n94\n00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.020\nAnd then the duration unlimited.\n\n95\n00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.430\nWe can't specify A certain\ntime period if we wanted.\n\n96\n00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.870\nA lot of times you might not know what\nthat time period is when you first set it\n\n97\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.050\nup so you might start with indefinite and\nthen move back.\n\n98\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.900\nAnd to finish out I want to set\nthe mailbox back to where it was.\n\n99\n00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.370\nWe're going to turn off litigation hold.\n\n100\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.890\nby setting it to false,\nI'm doing this just so\n\n101\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:38.540\nJack doesn't have this massive mailbox\ngrowing and me forgetting about it later.\n\n102\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Now, Brian, for Jack, since we've\nset it on his mailbox, does he know any\n\n103\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.400\ndifferent as mail is coming in and out,\nthat we've got a legal hold on everything?\n\n104\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.280\nNo, he's totally unaware of this.\n\n105\n00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.410\nAnd that's typically how\nyou want to keep it, right?\n\n106\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.960\nSo, two important points.\n\n107\n00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.160\nUsers are totally unaware\nthey can't bypass it.\n\n108\n00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.710\nAnd, all this stuff does not\nimpact the mailbox quota, right?\n\n109\n00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.990\nSo, if you had, say,\na two gig quota on a mailbox, and\n\n110\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.840\nyou're starting to do a legal hold.\n\n111\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.670\nSome times people ask hey what happens\nif the legal whole makes the mail box\n\n112\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.200\nlarger than decoder.\n\n113\n00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.610\nWell, doesn't impact it instead\nthere was a separate coder for\n\n114\n00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.720\nthis and\nit's much higher 2030 gets on that.\n\n115\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if we need it now that we\ngot kind of looks like the set up we need\n\n116\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.060\n&gt;&gt; What do we need to do to place a query\n\n117\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.690\nbased in place hold?\n\n118\n00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.986\n&gt;&gt; So now we're gonna get\ninto the actual e-discovery.\n\n119\n00:07:35.986 --> 00:07:39.520\nAnd e-discovery is let's search\nsome mailboxes, whether it's one or\n\n120\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.920\nall, for specific criteria and\nfigure out if it's out there.\n\n121\n00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.295\nSo, I wanna drop down to the computer\n&gt;&gt; And kick a couple of things off.\n\n122\n00:07:51.295 --> 00:07:56.781\nSo we are gonna do,\nnow this query based in place hold.\n\n123\n00:07:56.781 --> 00:08:01.774\nLet me describe it really quick before\nJump into it, which we're gonna perform\n\n124\n00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:07.190\na query, looking for specific email data,\nmaybe that matches keywords.\n\n125\n00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.690\nAnd if it found,\nwe wanna make sure that data,\n\n126\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.200\nthat's found as part of the query is held.\n\n127\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.850\nSo, you actually can hold just all data.\n\n128\n00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.300\nLitigation hold enabled true,\nyou hold everything.\n\n129\n00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.250\nNow we're diving into a query based hold,\n\n130\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.830\nwhere we're only holding stuff\nthat actually matches the query.\n\n131\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.358\nLet's take a look at this.\n\n132\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.573\nSo it's a new mailbox search.\n\n133\n00:08:32.573 --> 00:08:37.449\nWe're gonna give it a name, and\nthis name is important because,\n\n134\n00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:40.561\nthis is what you'll see in the GUI layer.\n\n135\n00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:44.240\nWe're gonna specify the start date and\nwe're going to say,\n\n136\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.198\nfrom the beginning of the year.\n\n137\n00:08:46.198 --> 00:08:53.678\nThe end date, we're gonna put as 331\nend of the month here SourceMailboxes.\n\n138\n00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:58.227\nIn this case,\nwe just have one Jack.Jackson,\n\n139\n00:08:58.227 --> 00:09:03.815\nTargetMailbox is gonna be our\nDiscovery Search Mailbox.\n\n140\n00:09:03.815 --> 00:09:05.307\nThat's where everything is gonna end up.\n\n141\n00:09:05.307 --> 00:09:11.083\nAnd then SearchQuery,\nwe're gonna be looking for the term owl.\n\n142\n00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.523\nTalked a little bit about birding.\n\n143\n00:09:12.523 --> 00:09:16.026\nWe suspect that there's some type of\nbirding conspiracy going on in here.\n\n144\n00:09:16.026 --> 00:09:17.889\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we're going to find it.\n\n145\n00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:20.512\nAnd then we're going to specify\nthe message types as email.\n\n146\n00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:26.700\nWe're going to include the unsearchable\nitems, and this is optional.\n\n147\n00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.041\nLogging level's gonna be set to full,\n\n148\n00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:35.040\nand then finally\nthe InPlaceHoldEnabled is true.\n\n149\n00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.320\nSo if we don't do\nthe InPlaceHoldEnabled is true,\n\n150\n00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.230\nthen we just are doing a big search,\nand that's it.\n\n151\n00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.780\nIn this case, we're doing a search, but\n\n152\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.970\nthen we're gonna hold all\nthe items that we find.\n\n153\n00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.680\nSo let's kick this off and\nmake sure I typed it right.\n\n154\n00:09:48.895 --> 00:09:49.824\nAnd there we go.\n\n155\n00:09:49.824 --> 00:09:52.770\nSo the hold setting may take up\nto 60 minutes to take effect.\n\n156\n00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.260\nThat's what we've been\nseeing up until now.\n\n157\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.960\nAnd you can see the status as NotStarted.\n\n158\n00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.710\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you how to start it.\n\n159\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.090\nSo we're gonna Start-MailboxSearch and\n\n160\n00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.480\nwe're gonna specify eDiscovery,\nthe one we just created.\n\n161\n00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.666\nAnd I actually didn't type it quite right,\nso\n\n162\n00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:14.264\nI'm gonna have to mistype it here to\nmake sure we kick it off appropriately.\n\n163\n00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:19.745\nAnd that actually kicks off the search.\n\n164\n00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:22.633\nAnd at this point,\nExchange is gonna go look for\n\n165\n00:10:22.633 --> 00:10:25.172\nthe term owl in Jack Jackson's mailbox.\n\n166\n00:10:25.172 --> 00:10:29.534\nAnd now let's go take a look at how you\ncan figure out the results of the search.\n\n167\n00:10:29.534 --> 00:10:31.960\nSo we're gonna leave PowerShell.\n\n168\n00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.009\nWe're gonna go back here.\n\n169\n00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.099\nCompliance.\n\n170\n00:10:37.974 --> 00:10:40.385\nIn-place hold,\nI think we're already there.\n\n171\n00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:45.115\nAnd Just a little bit big but\nlet's go down and see,\n\n172\n00:10:45.115 --> 00:10:49.962\nI'm gonna refresh this and\nsee if it's in here yet.\n\n173\n00:10:49.962 --> 00:10:55.315\nThere it is right there,\neDisocovery Jack owl.\n\n174\n00:10:55.315 --> 00:10:59.614\nAnd then on the right just\na little tough in this resolution,\n\n175\n00:10:59.614 --> 00:11:01.480\nlet me see if I can find it.\n\n176\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.322\nI actually, I don't think I'm going\nto be able to get to it here.\n\n177\n00:11:07.322 --> 00:11:13.750\nLet me see if I can drop the view\ndown a little bit and there we go.\n\n178\n00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.040\nI'll pop the view back\nopen in just a minute,\n\n179\n00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.430\nbut up here in the right hand\nside there's a little open here.\n\n180\n00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.820\nAnd that's what I wanna\ndo to view the results.\n\n181\n00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.428\nI'm gonna zoom back into about 150 here.\n\n182\n00:11:31.884 --> 00:11:37.350\nAnd here\nare the eDiscovery-Jack-owl search.\n\n183\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.540\nYou can see that the search succeeded and\nthe only question is,\n\n184\n00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.210\ndid we actually get anything?\n\n185\n00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.010\nAnd it doesn't look like we did,\n\n186\n00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.980\nto be forthcoming I wasn't sure\nwe had any owls in his mailbox.\n\n187\n00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.480\nWe do have another search coming up,\nwhere I do think we'll find something.\n\n188\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.530\nBut I do have a couple of\nprevious searches, and\n\n189\n00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.030\nlet me see I think I've got a result here.\n\n190\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.280\nHere's one in a different mailbox, and\n\n191\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.140\nwe've got an email here with the term\nOwl and I'll just show it to you.\n\n192\n00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.140\nYou can open it up as though you\nwere reading the email and remember,\n\n193\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.985\nyour the E-Discovery searcher guy and\nthe idea is that,\n\n194\n00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:17.400\nyou'll be able to flip\nthrough this data and\n\n195\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:23.550\nfigure out if it's useful in your\nE-discovery case or your legal matter.\n\n196\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:28.090\nYou can also export this stuff or\ndo whatever it is that you want to do\n\n197\n00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.950\nkeep it here, and\nlet it continue to collect data.\n\n198\n00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.790\nSo that is the query based in place hold.\n\n199\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.240\nThe interesting thing here is that,\n\n200\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.180\nwhile we didn't find out\nin the mail box right now.\n\n201\n00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.390\nWe are going to continue searching for\n\n202\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:49.650\nuntil we decide to turn this thing off, so\nfuture emails that come in that actually\n\n203\n00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:54.370\nhave the term all in them will start\nshowing up right here in our e-discovery.\n\n204\n00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.840\n&gt;&gt; Now, it looks like that you\nfocused in on a single mailbox here,\n\n205\n00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.800\nwhich was Jack's mailbox,\nto help us do the search.\n\n206\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.880\nAnd you described us to query on\nthe query based in place holder.\n\n207\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.640\nIs really looking for the term,\nowl is what we were looking for.\n\n208\n00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.880\nBut what if we also needed\nto perform a search on,\n\n209\n00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.510\nlet's say multiple mailboxes instead.\n\n210\n00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.840\nCan we do that as well?\n\n211\n00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, certainly we can.\n\n212\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.570\nA very similar command and\nthis is a very common one.\n\n213\n00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.830\nBecause often you're looking for\nitems across an organization, or\n\n214\n00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.990\nmaybe across at least a department.\n\n215\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.120\nSo, let's do a search across\na couple of mailboxes.\n\n216\n00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.052\nThis time we won't actually\nput the hold in place.\n\n217\n00:13:36.433 --> 00:13:38.311\nNew mailbox search.\n\n218\n00:13:42.236 --> 00:13:46.096\nWe're going to call this\none Eagle Start date\n\n219\n00:13:52.823 --> 00:13:54.486\nOkay cmdlet's wrong.\n\n220\n00:13:54.486 --> 00:13:58.402\nI'm trying to do tab completion,\nit's not working.\n\n221\n00:13:58.402 --> 00:14:05.884\nStartDate and we're gonna go 30/01/2017,\n\n222\n00:14:05.884 --> 00:14:10.507\nendDate 03/17/2017.\n\n223\n00:14:10.507 --> 00:14:18.226\nSourceMailboxes, we're gonna search\nJack.Jackson and Tom.Zeller.\n\n224\n00:14:18.226 --> 00:14:23.172\nSearchQuery is eagle.\n\n225\n00:14:23.172 --> 00:14:24.666\nMessageType is Email.\n\n226\n00:14:26.504 --> 00:14:29.945\nTarget mailbox is our\ndiscovery search mailbox.\n\n227\n00:14:29.945 --> 00:14:32.060\nI'm gonna need that in quotes,\ncuz it has spaces.\n\n228\n00:14:37.645 --> 00:14:43.494\nAnd we'll include unsearchable items and\nhit Enter.\n\n229\n00:14:43.494 --> 00:14:47.916\nAgain, here we've got a new mailbox\nsearch that's ready to be kicked off, but\n\n230\n00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:49.444\nyou still have to start it.\n\n231\n00:14:49.444 --> 00:14:53.400\nSo Start MailboxSearch \"Eagle\".\n\n232\n00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:59.089\nSo, this is kicking off in the background,\n\n233\n00:14:59.089 --> 00:15:04.563\nthe easiest way to go get that\ndata is right out here in the EAC,\n\n234\n00:15:04.563 --> 00:15:09.434\nI've got a couple of tabs and\nI'm gonna refresh this.\n\n235\n00:15:09.434 --> 00:15:14.117\nYou can see we had four in there\nright now, we should now have five.\n\n236\n00:15:14.117 --> 00:15:17.996\nThere it is right there, Eagle.\n\n237\n00:15:17.996 --> 00:15:20.998\nHold status you can see is no.\n\n238\n00:15:20.998 --> 00:15:23.219\nAnd it looks like the search succeeded,\nand\n\n239\n00:15:23.219 --> 00:15:25.830\nit looks like we've got\nsome items down here.\n\n240\n00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:31.410\nLet me make this a little smaller and\nzoom in for a second here.\n\n241\n00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:36.670\nThe way this GUI works is, if we go\ntoo big, we can't see it ourselves.\n\n242\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.710\nBut I just wanna show\nyou what we have here.\n\n243\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:39.210\nSo.\n\n244\n00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:44.777\nLet's try that again.\n\n245\n00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:47.002\nSo this is what we're looking at.\n\n246\n00:15:47.002 --> 00:15:48.948\nThe search succeeded.\n\n247\n00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.544\nIt was run by me.\n\n248\n00:15:50.544 --> 00:15:54.704\nWe've got three hundred and\nseventeen KB of data, found 12 items.\n\n249\n00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:59.292\nAnd this little open link is the one I\nwasn't able to find when the resolution's\n\n250\n00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.040\ntoo big.\n\n251\n00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.550\nBut that's what we're gonna click to\nopen that new tab, and show the data.\n\n252\n00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.247\nSo let's do that now.\n\n253\n00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.340\nOkay, so here we are in\nthe discovery search mail box.\n\n254\n00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.900\nNow you'll notice that we have\nmultiple entries in here.\n\n255\n00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.070\nAnd this is because we're sending the\nresults to the same mail box every time.\n\n256\n00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.900\nThis isn't all that uncommon\nif you got an eDiscovery case.\n\n257\n00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:28.250\nAnd let's see if,\nhere's our eagle over here.\n\n258\n00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.810\nAnd you can see we've actually got\nthree results and there they are.\n\n259\n00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.292\nAnd they look just like regular\nemails before, you can open them, and\n\n260\n00:16:36.292 --> 00:16:39.370\nyou can take action on them,\nsave them, export them.\n\n261\n00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.020\nBut now in our discovery search mailbox,\n\n262\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.370\nwe can have multiple\ndifferent searches running.\n\n263\n00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:45.910\nSome holding, some not, and\n\n264\n00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.720\nwe can always come back up here to\nsee the latest results of the data.\n\n265\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.400\n&gt;&gt; Now with this type of search, Brian,\n\n266\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.990\nwould we also need to have, or\nenable that litigation hold, or\n\n267\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:00.260\nlegal hold, on all those mailboxes\nbefore we could do a search like this?\n\n268\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.160\nOr is this something just\nthe exchange admin can do?\n\n269\n00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.098\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can do a eDiscovery\nsearch with no holds, no retention.\n\n270\n00:17:08.098 --> 00:17:12.820\nI don't wanna say they're unrelated,\nbut you can do eDiscovery even without\n\n271\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.140\nany of the holds in place, or\nany of the litigation holds.\n\n272\n00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.590\nTypically though, when you're doing\neDiscovery, and it's related to legal,\n\n273\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.780\nas a safety precaution,\nespecially if you find initial data,\n\n274\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.570\nyou might then enable the hold, so that\nway you catch everything going forward.\n\n275\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.910\n&gt;&gt; All right now, there's also of course\nthe idea here that they call out on\n\n276\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.300\nthe exam about the way that things\nare now integrating in with SharePoint.\n\n277\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.520\nAnd what we wanna do is we wanna take\na look at integrating the federated search\n\n278\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.510\nwith Microsoft SharePoint\nDiscovery Center.\n\n279\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.090\nWhat are we talking about there?\n\n280\n00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.045\nAnd how is it related to our eDiscovery?\n\n281\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthis is an interesting one, right?\n\n282\n00:17:49.855 --> 00:17:52.970\nWe're talking about exchange,\nand now we've got SharePoint.\n\n283\n00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.230\nFor those of you that don't\nwork with SharePoint,\n\n284\n00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:00.020\nmy recommendation here is\njust review this topic.\n\n285\n00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.540\nLook at the prerequisites as\npart of your exam preparation.\n\n286\n00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:09.160\nBut what this really entails is,\nthe ability to take SharePoint and\n\n287\n00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:14.880\nexchange data and\ndo eDiscovery across both from one place.\n\n288\n00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.390\nAnd that place is\nthe SharePoint Discovery Center.\n\n289\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:24.170\n&gt;&gt; All right then, when we start to take a\nlook, integration sounds interesting, but\n\n290\n00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.240\nhow does that provide any functionality,\nor better functionality for us?\n\n291\n00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, imagine if you were the IT team,\nand the legal team came and said,\n\n292\n00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.090\nhey look, we need all your\nemail data related to eagles.\n\n293\n00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.970\nThen they walk down the hallway\nto the SharePoint team and\n\n294\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.720\nsay, we need all of your\nSharePoint data related to eagles.\n\n295\n00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.610\nYou got two different teams\nrunning two different searches,\n\n296\n00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.210\nthe data ends up in two different places,\nright?\n\n297\n00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:52.259\nSo this whole functionality allows that\nto be more of a centralized approach,\n\n298\n00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:54.101\nmaybe one guy can take it on.\n\n299\n00:18:54.101 --> 00:18:54.829\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n300\n00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:58.600\nwhat are some of the ways about\nperforming the idea of this integration?\n\n301\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.000\nAnd I'm pretty sure it's not just, we\nclick a check mark, and everything's done.\n\n302\n00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty specific, but\n\n303\n00:19:05.147 --> 00:19:10.170\nwhat we have high level, we have the\nExchange Web Services API that needs to\n\n304\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.842\nbe installed on all\nthe SharePoint servers.\n\n305\n00:19:12.842 --> 00:19:17.390\nWe've gotta configure server to server\nauthentication with a couple of PowerShell\n\n306\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.230\ncommandlets on the SharePoint side,\nand on the Exchange side.\n\n307\n00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.850\nAnd then the final piece is similar\nto what we did in exchange,\n\n308\n00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.220\nwhere we gave rights to somebody\nto do the eDiscovery work.\n\n309\n00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.470\nWe have to do that same thing\non the SharePoint side.\n\n310\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian,\nwell that's a lot of interesting\n\n311\n00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.170\nthings that we have to make\nsure that we do cover.\n\n312\n00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.860\nIn the very fact that eDiscovery\nis going to probably be\n\n313\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.060\none of the key pieces when you work for\na large organization that has to meet,\n\n314\n00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:48.320\nof course, regulatory, or some type\nof compliance issues that we have.\n\n315\n00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.120\nSo what Brian showed us here, of course,\n\n316\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.370\nis that idea of being able to get\nready to do things like eDiscovery.\n\n317\n00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.510\nSuch as remembering that the user that's\ngonna be doing this has to have that\n\n318\n00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:03.380\nspecific role based access control\nof the discovery management.\n\n319\n00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:07.890\nMake sure that user has that, and then we\nalso, of course, took a look at how we can\n\n320\n00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:14.920\nenable a litigation hold, or a legal hold\non a particular user's mailbox as well.\n\n321\n00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.100\nBrian also helped us to distinguish\nthe idea of a query based,\n\n322\n00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.970\nin place hold, by limiting the parameters,\nof course, to a search that we wanted,\n\n323\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.400\nand make sure that was also in place.\n\n324\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.050\nAnd then he also showed\nus the ability to do\n\n325\n00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.920\nthese searches across multiple\nmailboxes to do that.\n\n326\n00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.780\nNow one question I did emphasize is that,\n\n327\n00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.370\ndoes this actually require\na legal hold for us to do this?\n\n328\n00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.370\nHe said, not necessarily.\n\n329\n00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.400\nRemember that all this can be done\nwithout actually having a hold in place.\n\n330\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.910\nSo we should be fine with that too.\n\n331\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.170\nAnd then lastly,\nwe did take a look here, or\n\n332\n00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:51.410\nBrian did mention the idea of\nusing Share Point's discovery.\n\n333\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.390\nMake sure that that is a part of it.\n\n334\n00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.430\nAnd the idea of actually being able to run\nthis type of discovery through SharePoint\n\n335\n00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.250\nis something that you may want\nto be sure that you look into,\n\n336\n00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.940\nespecially in getting ready for the exam.\n\n337\n00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.030\nNow Brian, on the eDiscovery side for\ngetting ready for\n\n338\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.970\nthe exam, this doesn't seem\nlike too much of a challenge.\n\n339\n00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.510\nThe commands that seem to be run,\ndon't look like it requires really any\n\n340\n00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.980\nadditional infrastructure, besides\nwhat you can actually do in the lab.\n\n341\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.455\nSo any tricky things about this that\nwe might need to take a look at?\n\n342\n00:21:22.455 --> 00:21:27.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think from the exam preparation\naspect, it's fairly straightforward, and\n\n343\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.280\nit's also something you\ncan do in home lab,\n\n344\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.560\nor in a development environment at work.\n\n345\n00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.876\nI will emphasize that\nthe tricky parts here,\n\n346\n00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:40.111\nare figuring out whether you need a hold,\nwhat kinda hold you need, for\n\n347\n00:21:40.111 --> 00:21:45.797\nhow long, how do you flip that stuff on,\nand what the impacts are of the hold?\n\n348\n00:21:45.797 --> 00:21:49.989\nAnd when we talked some of those little\ndetails, like about the quotas, and\n\n349\n00:21:49.989 --> 00:21:52.890\nwhere the information gets\nsent in the eDiscovery.\n\n350\n00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.060\nThose little details I think\nmight pop up on the exam.\n\n351\n00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:57.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian.\n\n352\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.770\nWell thank you again for helping us\nout in learning more about eDiscovery.\n\n353\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.850\nAnd

00:00:06.646\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:11.221\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:14.930\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.790\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today,\nyou're watching planning, configuring, and\n\n7\n00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.430\nmanaging.\n\n8\n00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.230\nWell, compliance solutions.\n\n9\n00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.930\nIn Exchange 2016.\n\n10\n00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.410\nAnd here to help us is our Exchange\nexpert Mr. Brian Svidergol.\n\n11\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.140\nBrian, welcome back to our show and\n\n12\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.470\ntell us where we're gonna get\nstarted in terms of compliance.\n\n13\n00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.450\n&gt;&gt; Sure Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.120\nSo today we are gonna get started\non a topic named Mail Tips.\n\n15\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.270\nAnd if you're not familiar with them,\nmail tips are those little Status messages\n\n16\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.310\nthat are displayed in outlook or\noutlook on the web, that give you some\n\n17\n00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.350\nsort of indication of either, you know\nsomebody is gone to office or there\n\n18\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.710\nis an issue sending to the user may be\nthey are on vacation, something like that.\n\n19\n00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.250\nThey can be used for\nhopeful idea of purposes often for\n\n20\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.550\nnotifying somebody of something permanent\nto who they are sending to So very useful.\n\n21\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.940\nThere are a couple of built-in ones, but\n\n22\n00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.200\nwe're gonna really dive into how you\ncan customize them in your environment.\n\n23\n00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian.\n\n24\n00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.230\nSo when we start taking a look at this,\nwhat do we need to do to get started\n\n25\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.161\nwhen we actually want to make\nsomething like a custom?\n\n26\n00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.130\nAnd what do we need to do?\n\n27\n00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.870\nSo we're gonna get onto\nmailbox server number one.\n\n28\n00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.910\nAnd let's take a look at\nthe configuration and\n\n29\n00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.510\nwalk through the process\nof creating a new mail tip.\n\n30\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.040\nWe are gonna start by getting\nthe organization config., and\n\n31\n00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.230\nwe're gonna select everything having to do\nwith mail tips or starting with mail tip.\n\n32\n00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.110\nSo, this is the default\nsettings in Exchange.\n\n33\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.220\nAllTipsEnabled, true.\n\n34\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.110\nThere's an ExternalRecipientsTip,\nwhich is not enabled.\n\n35\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.980\nThat's set to false.\n\n36\n00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.669\nWhat that one does is warn you if you're\nabout to send to an external recipient.\n\n37\n00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.620\nToday, I think that there's so many\nemails going in and out of the internet.\n\n38\n00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.640\nThat if you were notified every\ntime you sent something externally,\n\n39\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.920\nit would be a degraded user experience.\n\n40\n00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.410\nBut it's available for you.\n\n41\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.184\nNext, we're gonna do\na Set-OrganizationConfig.\n\n42\n00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.500\nMailTipsExternalRecipientsTipsEnabled.\n\n43\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.060\nIt's a mouthful.\n\n44\n00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.680\nWe're gonna set that to true.\n\n45\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.460\nAnd then we are going to\ncreate a mail tip for\n\n46\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.520\na special distribution group,\nour sales group.\n\n47\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.450\nAnd we can set this on a per\ndistribution group basis,\n\n48\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.600\na per mailbox basis, for right now\nlet's look at it at the sales one.\n\n49\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.290\nAnd our MailTip is gonna say,\nto place an order immediately,\n\n50\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.814\ncall 949-555-1212.\n\n51\n00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.380\nAnd now we have our first custom mail tip.\n\n52\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.950\nLet's give you a couple real\nworld use in this real quick.\n\n53\n00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.130\nSo I mean this is kind of a funny one,\nright?\n\n54\n00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.270\nThe sales team, hey instead of emailing\nus, if you want an order, give us a call.\n\n55\n00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.400\nYou might set this up, though,\n\n56\n00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.590\non a support or\ntech support type distribution group.\n\n57\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.320\nSaying hey,\nif you need immediate assistance or\n\n58\n00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.080\nif your computer is down, call our\nextension instead, something like that.\n\n59\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.740\nAll right, so let's take a look at what it\nlooks like from the client perspective.\n\n60\n00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:40.060\nLet's get onto Client 1,\nand this missed Day 4.\n\n61\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.560\nAnd who we are on as?\n\n62\n00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.190\nLooks like jack.jackson and\nthat will work.\n\n63\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.160\nAnd what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna send a new email,\n\n64\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.270\noops, we're gonna send it to sales.\n\n65\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.080\nHave a couple of people that match that\nterm And we're gonna say testing, testing.\n\n66\n00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.880\nSo, I'm gonna make this smaller and\n\n67\n00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.300\nzoom in to show you some\npertinent details here.\n\n68\n00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.120\nSo right up here at the top,\n\n69\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.549\nthese two items are what\nare referred to as mail tips.\n\n70\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.470\nSo I wanna focus on the bottom one.\n\n71\n00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.750\nTo place an order immediately call us,\nright?\n\n72\n00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.610\nThat's the one we've just created.\n\n73\n00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.930\nThe other one is one of those\nbuilt-in mail tips I talked about.\n\n74\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.260\nThis is when there's moderation\nin place on a distribution group.\n\n75\n00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.230\nSo notice it says messages sent to it\nmight not Actually immediately appear,\n\n76\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.830\nor might be rejected because the moderator\nmight say, hey, inappropriate.\n\n77\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.220\nBut that's two mail tips,\n\n78\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.950\nyou can display more than one on\na distribution group or on a mailbox.\n\n79\n00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.220\nAnd they're fairly effective,\n\n80\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.400\nyou can use that red X next to them\nto get rid of them if you want them.\n\n81\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.739\nSo, that in a nutshell, is what we're\ntalking about here with mail tips.\n\n82\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.400\nNow Brian another concept that we wanna\nmake sure that we address in terms of\n\n83\n00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.520\ncompliance is the idea of\nmessage classification.\n\n84\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.820\nNow why is something like this so\nimportant to an organization?\n\n85\n00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.620\n&gt;&gt; The message classification gives a user\nthe ability to classify an individual\n\n86\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.260\nemail message, with the idea that it would\n&gt;&gt; Kinda say hey,\n\n87\n00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.650\nhere's the intended audience or\nthe intended use for this message.\n\n88\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.030\nSo I'll give you an example.\n\n89\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.480\nLet's talk consulting company.\n\n90\n00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.330\nAnd maybe they're a partner with\none of the big IT providers.\n\n91\n00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.050\nAnd the idea is, is they get that partner\ncommunication from the big IT provider.\n\n92\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.350\n&gt;&gt; The big IT provider can specify\ncertain documents as being partner only.\n\n93\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.290\nThey're not meant for the public.\n\n94\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.640\nWith message classification they can\nmark those emails as partner only and\n\n95\n00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.780\nwhat happens is if other users get those,\nwhether they're forwarded to them or\n\n96\n00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.810\nwhatever They'll see\nthat classification and\n\n97\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.640\nknow that's not something they\nshould put up on their blog or\n\n98\n00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.330\nsend it out to other people outside\nthe departmental organization.\n\n99\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.738\nSo that's what we're talking about\nwith messaging classification.\n\n100\n00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:04.321\n&gt;.\n\n101\n00:06:04.321 --> 00:06:12.060\nNow Brian sounds a lot like the idea\nalso of The rights management idea.\n\n102\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.120\nSo, if we have message classification, we\nhave that idea of the information rights\n\n103\n00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.420\nmanagement, when should I choose\nto use one versus the other?\n\n104\n00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good question.\n\n105\n00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:28.550\nSo, message classification, think of it\nas a less strict implementation, right?\n\n106\n00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.860\nIRM is gonna be,\nwe're encrypting data That’s it, right.\n\n107\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.610\nClassification is an optional thing\nthat a user can decide to implement.\n\n108\n00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.160\nAnd even if a message is classified\n\n109\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.040\nit doesn't necessarily mean\nthere’s any actions placed on it.\n\n110\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.800\nSo, I might classify something as\npartner only forward it over to Ronnie.\n\n111\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.090\nAnd Ronnie can still send\nit to whoever he wants.\n\n112\n00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.820\nThere's no protection, by default,\nwith just classification.\n\n113\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:02.470\nOne interesting aspect though, is you can\ntie classification into mail flow rules.\n\n114\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.880\nSo, we talked about transport rules.\n\n115\n00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.210\nWe've showed some of that with DLP,\nI think it was yesterday.\n\n116\n00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.530\nAnd so we can actually make routing\ndecisions based on message classification.\n\n117\n00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.700\nSo say if I see message\nclassified is internal only\n\n118\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.370\nheading to an external recipient I\ncan block that with a mail flow rule.\n\n119\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.740\nSo there are some things that you can put\nin place from a security perspective but\n\n120\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.330\nit's still not the same as\nfull message encryption.\n\n121\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.940\nAll right.\nSo how do we get started with\n\n122\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.010\ntrying to classify these messages?\n\n123\n00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.070\n&gt;&gt; So first step, we need to\ncreate an actual classification.\n\n124\n00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.080\nSo let's drop down to the computer and\ntake a look at that.\n\n125\n00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:46.205\nSo we're on Mailbox server number one.\n\n126\n00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:49.925\nNew-MessageClassification, there we go.\n\n127\n00:07:49.925 --> 00:07:56.771\nName, we're gonna call\nthis one \"Partners\"-\n\n128\n00:07:56.771 --> 00:08:02.322\nDisplayName \"Channel Partners Only.\n\n129\n00:08:02.322 --> 00:08:05.700\nAnd then we're gonna SenderDescription.\n\n130\n00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.792\nMaterial approved for\n\n131\n00:08:09.792 --> 00:08:13.456\nchannel partners.\n\n132\n00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:16.371\nRecipientDescription.\n\n133\n00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:22.220\nMessage is restricted to\nthe partner community.\n\n134\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.500\nOkay, so, now,\nwe have a message classification.\n\n135\n00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.230\nIn general, you'll have a whole bunch of\nthese based on your organization's needs.\n\n136\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.176\nNext, we are gonna go off to\nour client computer, client1.\n\n137\n00:08:38.176 --> 00:08:42.902\nLet me close our previous test here.\n\n138\n00:08:42.902 --> 00:08:48.626\nAnd I am going to go up to OWA.\n\n139\n00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:56.088\nThere we go on mailbox\nserver one we will sign in,\n\n140\n00:08:56.088 --> 00:09:03.190\nand we are going to create\na new email message.\n\n141\n00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.580\nAnd let me scroll over\npretty big resolution here.\n\n142\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.110\nLet's send this over to Ronnie,\nhe's still on our directory?\n\n143\n00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.572\nThere he is, subject.\n\n144\n00:09:16.572 --> 00:09:22.370\nOkay, so this is my email message,\nand this particular\n\n145\n00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.870\none I think should be restricted to\npartners with that new classification.\n\n146\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.760\nWe have this little ellipsis up here.\n\n147\n00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:29.810\nWe're gonna click that.\n\n148\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.150\nWe're gonna go down to Set permissions.\n\n149\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.300\nAnd you're gonna see\nChannel Partners Only right here.\n\n150\n00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.260\nNow, there's an interesting\ncomponent here,\n\n151\n00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.960\nbecause you're also seeing some\nother stuff like Do Not Forward.\n\n152\n00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.220\nThose actually come from IRM.\n\n153\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.570\nSo, earlier, Ronnie was asking about\nthe tie in IRM and message classification.\n\n154\n00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.016\nThey're both sort of security focused,\n\n155\n00:09:54.016 --> 00:09:58.760\nand in OWA, they combine them together for\nthe end user.\n\n156\n00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.200\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n157\n00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.623\nSo, we're going to click channel partners\nonly, and now you can see that we've got\n\n158\n00:10:04.623 --> 00:10:08.720\nthis little status message, material,\nor proof of channel partners.\n\n159\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.740\nThat was the message that we\nput in when we created it.\n\n160\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.450\nWe will go ahead and\nsend that over to Ronnie.\n\n161\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.880\nAnd there you have it, Ronnie will\nalso see that classification in OWA.\n\n162\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.670\nAnd he can choose to ignore it or\nfollow it.\n\n163\n00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:28.580\nAnd then what happens, is based on whether\nwe have any other transport rules.\n\n164\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.090\nOne more key point, we are in OWA,\n\n165\n00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.690\nyou might be wondering why, why aren't\nwe in Outlook and seeing it there.\n\n166\n00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.600\nWell, that's, because, Outlook by default\ndoesn't work with message classification.\n\n167\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.120\nInstead, you need to distribute these\nXML file usually through like group\n\n168\n00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.720\npolicy to Outlook in order for\nit to work with classification.\n\n169\n00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.950\nSo, that's something to definitely\nbe aware of for the exam.\n\n170\n00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, Brian since you\nmentioned the idea of transport rules\n\n171\n00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.980\nin dealing with compliance.\n\n172\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.270\nWhat are some of the issues that we\ndefinitely need to consider in terms of\n\n173\n00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.530\nthose transport rules, and the issues\nof compliance that we're talking about?\n\n174\n00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:11.260\nSo, transport rules they're\nvery powerful we've\n\n175\n00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.510\nseen how they can already do other stuff,\nI think, we did, quite a bit yesterday.\n\n176\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.080\nToday we're gonna see a couple more uses.\n\n177\n00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.240\nI wanna show you one particularly\nright now at the computer, so\n\n178\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.000\nlet's drop down to that.\n\n179\n00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.785\nWe're gonna go back to\nMailbox server number one.\n\n180\n00:11:30.628 --> 00:11:32.370\nLet me clear this stuff out.\n\n181\n00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.420\nSo, you can do a whole\nbunch with transport rules.\n\n182\n00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.010\nI'm gonna show you one\nfairly straight forward one.\n\n183\n00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.570\nWe're gonna do new transport rule.\n\n184\n00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.670\nNotice that we're doing\nit from PowerShell.\n\n185\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.840\nYesterday we did a lot from\nthe exchange administrative center.\n\n186\n00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.088\nYou could do it from either one.\n\n187\n00:11:47.088 --> 00:11:52.578\nAnd we're gonna call this Reject\n\n188\n00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:57.678\na1b2c3llc.com recipient\n\n189\n00:11:57.678 --> 00:12:01.802\ndomain is, same thing.\n\n190\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.290\nAnd that happens to be one of my domains.\n\n191\n00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.900\nSo, we can use it for testing, and\n\n192\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:14.330\nthis we're gonna need to do if from.\n\n193\n00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.270\nThere it is.\n\n194\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.480\nTab completion's tough for that one.\n\n195\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.870\nWe're gonna say, from Jackson.\n\n196\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.265\nAnd then we're going to say,\n\n197\n00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:29.711\nRejectMessageReasonText \"You\nare restricted from\n\n198\n00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:37.240\nsending to the a1b2c3llc.com domain.\" So\nwhat we've done here.\n\n199\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.030\nWe've created a new transport rule.\n\n200\n00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.240\nIt's going to look at all the messages\ncoming through the transport pipeline.\n\n201\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:48.482\nAnd if the target domain is a1b2c3llc.com\nthe message is going to be rejected on\n\n202\n00:12:48.482 --> 00:12:54.160\nthe back, and after it leave\nthe outbox unless you're Jack Jackson.\n\n203\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.490\nJack Jackson can send to a1b2c3,\nbut nobody else can.\n\n204\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.660\nSo, let's take a look at what that feels\nlike and looks like on the client side.\n\n205\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.986\nI'm gonna drop over to our client one,\nbut we're signed in as Jack Jackson,\n\n206\n00:13:08.986 --> 00:13:13.210\nso I'm gonna sign out,\nbecause we know he can already send, and\n\n207\n00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.124\nwe're gonna come back in as somebody else.\n\n208\n00:13:18.783 --> 00:13:22.162\nThis time how about tom.zeller.\n\n209\n00:13:32.207 --> 00:13:33.231\nGoing in.\n\n210\n00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:36.689\nWe are not logged in as Tom Zeller.\n\n211\n00:13:36.689 --> 00:13:41.365\nWe're gonna launch Outlook with our goal\nof sending an email to that domain to see\n\n212\n00:13:41.365 --> 00:13:42.270\nwhat happens.\n\n213\n00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:44.940\nThere it is.\n\n214\n00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:55.296\nWe're gonna generate a new email message,\n\n215\n00:13:55.296 --> 00:13:58.259\nand we are gonna say,\n\n216\n00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:04.364\nbrian@a1b2c3llc.com testing mail.\n\n217\n00:14:04.364 --> 00:14:06.590\nOkay, so we're gonna click Send.\n\n218\n00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:10.410\nNow, you will notice, we don't have any\nindication that there is a problem.\n\n219\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.100\nRemember, transport rules\nwork on the back end.\n\n220\n00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.820\nSo, it's gotta leave Outlook,\n\n221\n00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.700\nget into the transport pipeline,\nwhere the role can process it.\n\n222\n00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.500\nAnd then if it's rejected,\nwe will then be notified.\n\n223\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.820\nTake a look here.\n\n224\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.770\nWe just got a message back.\n\n225\n00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:30.370\nAnd what we can see here is our message,\nour reason text.\n\n226\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.250\nYou are restricted from sending\nto the a1b2c3llc domain.\n\n227\n00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.730\nNow, normally in an organization,\nyou would use something more descriptive,\n\n228\n00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.800\nwith a little more information,\ncontact the help desk,\n\n229\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.400\nmaybe go to this link you can do\na bunch of that kind of stuff.\n\n230\n00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.450\nIn this case so\n\n231\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.640\nat least we have just enough to indicate\nwhy this message didn't go through.\n\n232\n00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.190\nThis is not just standard MDR.\n\n233\n00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.550\n&gt;&gt; All right another exam objective for us\nin the last one in this particular section\n\n234\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:04.090\nis of course the talking about planning,\nand configuring generaling for compliance.\n\n235\n00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:09.280\nSo, what do we need to know here in\nterms of compliance and journaling?\n\n236\n00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.570\n&gt;&gt; So, journaling I think we touched\non it just a little bit yesterday,\n\n237\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.690\nbut let's define it really quick.\n\n238\n00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.620\nJournaling is taking a copy\nof specified messages, or\n\n239\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.655\nall messages, and funneling to a mailbox,\na journal mailbox, or\n\n240\n00:15:24.655 --> 00:15:29.970\nmore than one journal mailbox, I wanna\npoint out a couple of key details first.\n\n241\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.090\nYou have Standard Journaling and\nyou have Premium Journaling.\n\n242\n00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.980\nStandard Journaling set\nat the database level.\n\n243\n00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.050\nSo, let's say, I wanna journal\njust database one, I can go and\n\n244\n00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:45.400\ndo that at the database properties,\nand funnel that to a general mailbox.\n\n245\n00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.553\nPremium Journaling is a little bit\nmore powerful and what is does is,\n\n246\n00:15:49.553 --> 00:15:53.220\nit allows you to journal at\nthe whole organizational level.\n\n247\n00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:58.166\nCuz imagine you have a lot of databases,\nand you had to individually configure, and\n\n248\n00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:00.674\nmanage journaling at the database level,\n\n249\n00:16:00.674 --> 00:16:05.133\ngets to be a little problematic The deal\nwith premium journaling though is,\n\n250\n00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:08.940\nit requires an enterprise\nclient access license.\n\n251\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.060\nI don't think that's gonna\ncome up on the exam, but\n\n252\n00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.660\nit is a key detail I wanna\npoint out to start with.\n\n253\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.630\nSo, why don't we take a look\nat setting the journaling up.\n\n254\n00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:25.279\nWe are gonna go to the EAC in this case.\n\n255\n00:16:29.715 --> 00:16:35.820\nAnd I'm gonna create a new mailbox and\nwe're going to name it Journal.\n\n256\n00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:43.872\nAnd I don't think I have\na Username journal yet.\n\n257\n00:16:43.872 --> 00:16:48.549\nWe're gonna need to associate\na name there and password.\n\n258\n00:16:55.653 --> 00:16:57.840\nOkay, we're gonna hit save.\n\n259\n00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.400\nAnd the reason we're doing this is because\n\n260\n00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.850\nwe need a mailbox in order to journal,\nright?\n\n261\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.190\nNormally, wanna call it something\ndescriptive so there we have it.\n\n262\n00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.780\nNow we're gonna go over to compliance,\n\n263\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.650\njournal rules and you can see we don't\nhave any so we're gonna click the plus.\n\n264\n00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:22.639\nAnd we're gonna do send journal\nreports to journal@hugelab.net,\n\n265\n00:17:22.639 --> 00:17:25.810\nthat's fine journal.\n\n266\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.720\nAnd then,\nhere is where we have our options.\n\n267\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.380\nIf the message is sent or\nreceived to a specific user or groups,\n\n268\n00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.120\nyou can do journaling at that level or\napply to all messages.\n\n269\n00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.660\nIt's most common to\napply the all messages.\n\n270\n00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.380\nNormally we're journaling,\nbecause we keep mail for\n\n271\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:47.680\na certain period of time, or\nmaybe for compliance reasons, right?\n\n272\n00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.500\nSo we're gonna do that, and\nthen journal the following messages,\n\n273\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.390\nall messages internal or external.\n\n274\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.400\nThis is actually one of\nthe premium features here.\n\n275\n00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.690\nSo, if we wanted to do just internal,\nwe could or just external.\n\n276\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.550\nIn this case we're gonna do all.\n\n277\n00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.860\nAnd you can see the little\nmessage down here.\n\n278\n00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.590\nIt says to use premium journaling,\n\n279\n00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.730\nyou must have an Enterprise\nclient access license.\n\n280\n00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.090\nHowever, it doesn't actually\nvalidate what license you have,\n\n281\n00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.850\njust to be aware of that.\n\n282\n00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.920\nSo we are now gonna click Save.\n\n283\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:24.340\nAnd, the thing that it asks you right\nthere is, kind of like a warning.\n\n284\n00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.370\nThis is now gonna apply\nto all future messages.\n\n285\n00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.940\nSo, it's a fairly big decision.\n\n286\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.600\nI want to point out an important\nconcept here with journaling.\n\n287\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.180\nSo, we're journaling all\nmessages coming in and out.\n\n288\n00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.500\nLet's go back to a topic we covered\non day one, which was sizing and\n\n289\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.350\ntransaction logs.\n\n290\n00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:47.120\nBy doing journaling, we have effectively\ndoubled the size of our transaction log.\n\n291\n00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.250\nAnd let me tell you why.\n\n292\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.570\nWhen a message comes in, and\nlet's say is coming in to Ronnie, right.\n\n293\n00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:57.550\nWe got a write to the transaction log,\nbut next we've got this rule\n\n294\n00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.860\nthat says we also need to get\nthat message over to the journal.\n\n295\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.260\nSo it's effectively doubling\nup the transaction log.\n\n296\n00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.880\nWhen you first turn on journaling, and\nif you've got a pretty big environment,\n\n297\n00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.720\njournaling can have a fairly significant\nimpact on your transaction logs.\n\n298\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.320\nSo it's something you wanna think\nabout when you're preparing and\n\n299\n00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.460\nplanning for journaling.\n\n300\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.210\nMaybe you need to increase your back up.\n\n301\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.580\nMaybe you need to do a back up right\nbefore you turn journaling on.\n\n302\n00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.090\nThose are some of the things\nto be thinking about.\n\n303\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.700\n&gt;&gt; And also, since we do have to deal with\nthis for compliance as well Brian, and\n\n304\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.640\njournaling is taking up the impact\nthat you're saying, does this affect\n\n305\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.570\nthe end-user in the way that they get\nemails in terms of the journaling?\n\n306\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.600\nSo, is there anything we can do to help\nimprove that performance on that side?\n\n307\n00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is another one\nof those technologies the user\n\n308\n00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.990\nwon't even realize it's there.\n\n309\n00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.200\nIt's just working in the background.\n\n310\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.680\nThere is a small impact on\nthe overall storage though.\n\n311\n00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.130\nLike one to two percent on the mailboxes,\nbut if you're doing everything\n\n312\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.632\nthat's another consideration in\naddition to those transaction logs.\n\n313\n00:20:02.632 --> 00:20:06.120\n&gt;&gt; All right Brian, so now that we've\nlooked at the idea of compliance a little\n\n314\n00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.970\nbit, we still need to go on and\ntake a look at some more auditing.\n\n315\n00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.730\nSo Brian, tell us a little\nbit more about planning and\n\n316\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.060\nconfiguring for\nmail box auditing a little bit.\n\n317\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.910\n&gt;&gt; Sure Ronnie.\n\n318\n00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:21.020\nThe first topic in auditing is gonna\nbe looking at how we can audit\n\n319\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.930\nmail box owners access and action.\n\n320\n00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.650\nAnd this is a little bit different\nfrom looking at what say,\n\n321\n00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.690\nthe administrative components\nare that we're gonna look at next.\n\n322\n00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now Brian, when is a situation\nin which we would really want the mailbox\n\n323\n00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.500\nowner himself to be auditing\ntheir own mailboxes?\n\n324\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so,\nfirst let's talk default values, right?\n\n325\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.180\nThe mailbox auditing is\nnot enabled by default.\n\n326\n00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.450\nSo this is an optional auditing\nfeature that you can enable.\n\n327\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.460\nWhen I typically see it used out there,\n\n328\n00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:58.410\nwhen I've used it myself is security\ncompliance or troubleshooting.\n\n329\n00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.680\nSo, let me give you one\nreal world example.\n\n330\n00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.650\nI had a user that was having\nsome odd issues in her mailbox.\n\n331\n00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.630\nAnd what was happening is\nitems were disappearing.\n\n332\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.550\nAnd for those of you listening now, or\n\n333\n00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.920\nlater, you may have run\ninto the same thing before.\n\n334\n00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.870\nBut this just wasn't a one time thing.\n\n335\n00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.600\nIt happened, I don't know,\nevery month or two.\n\n336\n00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.620\nAnd eventually, it was like, well, you\nknow, I'm gonna turn on the mailbox audit\n\n337\n00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.840\nlogging and figure out A,\nif the user is doing something or\n\n338\n00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.230\nB, what's happening and what the user\nis doing right before the event.\n\n339\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.050\nSo maybe it'll help troubleshoot and\ntrack down what the problem is.\n\n340\n00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.800\nSo that's one, you know,\nreal world use case.\n\n341\n00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.350\n&gt;&gt; All right, what are some other\nconsiderations that we need to think about\n\n342\n00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.440\nbefore enabling this?\n\n343\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.100\nSo, you showed us a good\nreason why we should.\n\n344\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.920\nBut, what are other considerations before\nwe go, let's just enable it for everyone?\n\n345\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthis has a small space consideration.\n\n346\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.445\nIt's like the 1% to 2% range.\n\n347\n00:21:56.445 --> 00:21:59.199\nSo, you know, it's not a lot of data but\n\n348\n00:21:59.199 --> 00:22:02.521\nit is still a cross the whole\norganisation it is.\n\n349\n00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.239\nIf you're tied on a storage or\n\n350\n00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:08.847\nyou are tied on resources because other\nthe other thing in general takes a little\n\n351\n00:22:08.847 --> 00:22:12.890\nbit more horse power CPU run\nabout little bit in disk space.\n\n352\n00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:18.630\nThe good news is this is usually on a per\nmail box basis, so it's not a big concern.\n\n353\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.120\n&gt;&gt; Alright, so\nwhat do these logs really look like Brian?\n\n354\n00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.340\nAnd can you a tell us what commands we're\ngoing to need so that we can see them.\n\n355\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah sure.\nLet's take a look at the a computer.\n\n356\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.740\nWe're gonna drop down into\n\"Power Shell\" and take a look.\n\n357\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.709\nWe are on mailbox server 1.\n\n358\n00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:45.817\nPut mailbox, audit, log and\nwe're going to take\n\n359\n00:22:45.817 --> 00:22:54.765\na look at Jack.Jackson So\nI want you to see that and\n\n360\n00:22:54.765 --> 00:22:59.140\nI don't know if you can see just how\nmuch stuff just scrolled through.\n\n361\n00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.250\nIt's an amazing amount of data.\n\n362\n00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:06.289\nI'm gonna just scroll up slowly to show\nyou just how much data's captured.\n\n363\n00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.190\nAnd it's kinda tough to\nwork with like this.\n\n364\n00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.950\nSo instead,\n\n365\n00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.138\nI'm gonna break it down to something\na little bit more human readable.\n\n366\n00:23:17.138 --> 00:23:26.290\nSo, Search-MailboxAuditLog\nJack.Jackson Show details.\n\n367\n00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:31.330\nThen we're gonna pipe that to\nwhere operation equals create.\n\n368\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.697\nThen we're going to select just\n\n369\n00:23:36.697 --> 00:23:42.906\nOperation,Operation Result and\nItemSubject.\n\n370\n00:23:42.906 --> 00:23:44.180\nLets take a look at this.\n\n371\n00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.130\nThis is a lot easier to read.\n\n372\n00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.775\nSo what we've got is the Create Operation.\n\n373\n00:23:48.775 --> 00:23:51.589\nThat usually means you're\ncreating an email or\n\n374\n00:23:51.589 --> 00:23:56.089\ncreating some other item in your mailbox,\nwhether it succeeded or not, and\n\n375\n00:23:56.089 --> 00:23:59.772\nthen the ItemSubject,\nwhich is only relevant with an email.\n\n376\n00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:03.234\nSo I can see all of this stuff and\npull it on back.\n\n377\n00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:07.050\nAnd the thing is, I can also pull\nthe dates and other information.\n\n378\n00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:11.700\nBut it helps take that huge amount\nof information we saw initially\n\n379\n00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.290\ndown to something more usable.\n\n380\n00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.810\nSo that's one way of filtering,\nthere's a bunch that you can do there.\n\n381\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.326\nCertainly, you want to explore\nthat as part of your preparation.\n\n382\n00:24:21.326 --> 00:24:26.133\n&gt;&gt; Now instead of actually just auditing\nregular mailboxes, what if we wanted\n\n383\n00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:30.805\nto also go ahead and configure for\nadministrative audit logging as well?\n\n384\n00:24:30.805 --> 00:24:34.320\nWhy would I choose to do that too,\nand then how do we do it?\n\n385\n00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.360\n&gt;&gt; So administrative audit logging is also\na type of auditing available in Exchange.\n\n386\n00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.852\nThe main difference is instead\nof monitoring mailbox owners.\n\n387\n00:24:44.852 --> 00:24:49.230\nYou're gonna monitor the administrative\nactions performed by the admin.\n\n388\n00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.840\nThe good news is this is\nactually enabled by default.\n\n389\n00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.640\nSo information is being captured,\nif you got a lab or\n\n390\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.870\nyou want to check it out at work.\n\n391\n00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.543\nIt's there, and you can look through\nit and get familiar with it.\n\n392\n00:25:01.543 --> 00:25:05.863\nLet's drop down to the command line,\nI'm gonna show you some of the details and\n\n393\n00:25:05.863 --> 00:25:06.840\ntalk through it.\n\n394\n00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:12.008\nSo first,\nI wanna get the AdminAuditLogConfig.\n\n395\n00:25:12.008 --> 00:25:15.002\nAnd let me make it a little\nmore human readable.\n\n396\n00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:21.216\nOkay, so AdminAuditLogEnabled True.\n\n397\n00:25:21.216 --> 00:25:23.990\nAnd then it shows you\nthe AdminAuditLogCmdlets.\n\n398\n00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.462\nThese are the specific cmdlets that\nwe're gonna capture in the auditing.\n\n399\n00:25:27.462 --> 00:25:31.467\nYou'll notice it has an asterisk that\nmeans we're capturing everything.\n\n400\n00:25:31.467 --> 00:25:37.459\nThere is by default, a couple of things\nwe don't capture, such as the git cmdlet.\n\n401\n00:25:37.459 --> 00:25:39.528\nAnd that's to be expected, right?\n\n402\n00:25:39.528 --> 00:25:43.170\nBecause with a git cmdlet,\nyou can't make any changes.\n\n403\n00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:47.786\nYou could pipe them to other cmdlets,\nbut those cmdlets would be captured.\n\n404\n00:25:47.786 --> 00:25:50.840\nAnd then we've got the parameters\nthat we're gonna capture.\n\n405\n00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.070\nThat's also an asterisk, so\nwe're gonna capture every parameter.\n\n406\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:59.768\nBoth of the cmdlet and the parameter,\nyou can change that to be very specific.\n\n407\n00:25:59.768 --> 00:26:04.876\nYou can audit specific cmdlets,\nspecific cmdlets and specific parameters.\n\n408\n00:26:04.876 --> 00:26:10.807\nIt gets very, very granular and then,\nwe have the AdminAuditLogExcludedCmdlets.\n\n409\n00:26:10.807 --> 00:26:16.175\nSo in addition to get, if you were doing\na whole bunch of say like new mailboxes.\n\n410\n00:26:16.175 --> 00:26:18.205\nAnd you didn't care to audit that data,\n\n411\n00:26:18.205 --> 00:26:21.560\nyou could throw the new-mailboxcmdlet\nin and exclude it.\n\n412\n00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.730\nThat helps clean up the amount\nof data in the AdminAuditLog.\n\n413\n00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.778\nAnd then finally, the LogAgeLimit,\nthat's the default, it's set to 90 days.\n\n414\n00:26:28.778 --> 00:26:33.380\nSo what that means is,\nany searches we perform go back 90 days,\n\n415\n00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:38.010\nif you need to go back further,\nyou can adjust that there.\n\n416\n00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.050\nSo let's take a look real quick\nat how you can make an adjustment\n\n417\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.220\nto your AdminAuditLogConfig.\n\n418\n00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.179\nIt's fairly straight forward,\nSet-AdminAuditLogConfig,\n\n419\n00:26:47.179 --> 00:26:51.513\nthen you just specify one of\nthe properties like we're looking here.\n\n420\n00:26:51.513 --> 00:26:58.090\nWe're gonna do\nan AdminAuditLogExcludedCmdlets.\n\n421\n00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:06.040\nAnd let's do New-Mailbox, Could take\nup to 60 minutes to take effect.\n\n422\n00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:11.424\nNow we're gonna go back, and\nwhen we get the configuration this time,\n\n423\n00:27:11.424 --> 00:27:14.397\nyou can see New-Mailbox is excluded.\n\n424\n00:27:14.397 --> 00:27:17.482\nSo fairly basic high level stuff here.\n\n425\n00:27:17.482 --> 00:27:20.218\nThat's how you look at what\nyou're configuration is,\n\n426\n00:27:20.218 --> 00:27:23.680\nhow you can set some of\nthose basic properties too.\n\n427\n00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.351\n&gt;&gt; Now earlier Brian,\nyou also showed us the ability to take\n\n428\n00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:33.425\na look at the logs for the managed,\nthe mailbox owner as well.\n\n429\n00:27:33.425 --> 00:27:36.400\nIs there another command\nthat's different for us?\n\n430\n00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.230\nWe take a look at the idea,\nthe administrative side?\n\n431\n00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.553\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so similar to the mailbox side,\nwe've got a search cmdlet and\n\n432\n00:27:42.553 --> 00:27:45.060\nit will pull down tons of information.\n\n433\n00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.510\nIt's slightly different and\n\n434\n00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:49.320\nthe information that comes back is of\ncourse a little bit different too.\n\n435\n00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.910\nLet's head back to the PowerShell\nprompt and take a look.\n\n436\n00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.152\nSo we're still at mailbox\nserver number one,\n\n437\n00:27:56.152 --> 00:27:59.570\nwe are gonna\nSearch-AdminAuditLog this time.\n\n438\n00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.720\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n439\n00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:08.510\nlet this thing run just to show you how\nextensive the information that comes back.\n\n440\n00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.790\nYou can see it just keep going and\ngoing and going.\n\n441\n00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.860\nAnd there's all the work that\nwe've actually done this week.\n\n442\n00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.220\nOkay, so there we have it.\n\n443\n00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.980\nObviously too much, it's totally unusable.\n\n444\n00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.210\nLet's work down through some filters and\n\n445\n00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.490\nsee if we can make it\na little more useful.\n\n446\n00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:29.464\nSo we are gonna specify\nwhere the Caller -eq\n\n447\n00:28:29.464 --> 00:28:33.680\nbsvidergol@hugelab.net.\n\n448\n00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.730\nYou'll notice this is not my primary admin\naccount, this is the secondary admin\n\n449\n00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:42.060\naccount that hasn't had as much activity,\njust pointing that out.\n\n450\n00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:46.340\nSo if I were to do just that,\nyou can see it's already finished up.\n\n451\n00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.820\nBut it's still quite a bit of data, so\n\n452\n00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.930\nwhat we are gonna do is\ndrive down even further.\n\n453\n00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.729\nWe're gonna form a list and\n\n454\n00:28:55.729 --> 00:29:02.007\nwe are gonna just grab caller,CmdletName,\n\n455\n00:29:02.007 --> 00:29:06.971\nRunDate, and CmdletParameters.\n\n456\n00:29:10.366 --> 00:29:11.675\nLet that run.\n\n457\n00:29:11.675 --> 00:29:16.655\nAnd so scrolling back up we\nprobably have maybe 20 or\n\n458\n00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:20.125\nso cmdlets that he's run,\nand it's fairly useable.\n\n459\n00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:23.470\nYou can see we ran the add\nmailbox permission.\n\n460\n00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:28.450\nAnd the parameters I specified\nare AccessRight, AutoMapping,\n\n461\n00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:29.690\nUser and Identity.\n\n462\n00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.860\nYou might remember,\nwe talked about AutoMapping.\n\n463\n00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.610\nSo it sounds like we added somebody\nto full access on a mailbox and\n\n464\n00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.270\nwe probably disabled AutoMapping.\n\n465\n00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.420\nSo just looking at the AdminAutoLog,\n\n466\n00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.620\nwe can sort of interpret\nall of that stuff, right?\n\n467\n00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:49.020\nThere's also additional information on\nwhich objects were actually modified,\n\n468\n00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.290\nI didn't pull back everything in this one.\n\n469\n00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:56.540\nHere we've got New-Mailbox, which we're\nno longer capturing in our AdminAutoLogs,\n\n470\n00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.510\nbut this is historical data.\n\n471\n00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:01.890\nAnd you can again see the parameters,\nand you can see the RunDate.\n\n472\n00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:05.210\nSo imagine that you've got\na whole team of administrators,\n\n473\n00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:08.580\nsomebody makes a change to\nthe organizational configuration.\n\n474\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.100\nAnd you've gotta figure out,\nwhen did it happen and\n\n475\n00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.870\nwho did it and\nwas there a mistake in the command?\n\n476\n00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.920\nWell you can find out by\nlooking at the parameters and\n\n477\n00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.440\nlooking at all these details.\n\n478\n00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.420\nVery, very useful.\n\n479\n00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.170\n&gt;&gt; All right Brian,\nwell that's a lot of information.\n\n480\n00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.490\nWhen we take a look at both\ncompliance as well as auditing.\n\n481\n00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.440\nRemember that in this episode we saw quite\na bit on how to set up and make sure that\n\n482\n00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.750\neverything is running according to the way\nthat we're set up for a compliance.\n\n483\n00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.920\nSo make sure you go back and\nyou review those bigger topics as well.\n\n484\n00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.605\nBrian also emphasized in each of those\nsections in compliance compare them with\n\n485\n00:30:42.605 --> 00:30:44.151\nother tools that sound similar.\n\n486\n00:30:44.151 --> 00:30:48.239\nSo that we know exactly which tool\nwe would use in that situation for\n\n487\n00:30:48.239 --> 00:30:50.040\ncompliance as well.\n\n488\n00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.760\nAnd also in auditing, Ryan showed us this\nability of course to go back through and\n\n489\n00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.570\nnot only monitor the mail\nbox owner's actions.\n\n490\n00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:02.130\nBut also of course\nthe administrative actions for\n\n491\n00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.470\nthe Exchange administrator as well and\neverything that they do.\n\n492\n00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.890\nAnd all this is combining together\nto help make sure that we're\n\n493\n00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.270\ngetting things the way they need to\nbe according to compliance measures.\n\n494\n00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.990\nAnd that were actually able to go back and\n\n495\n00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.730\nverify it through the logs\nthat are actually there too.\n\n496\n00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.780\nSo there's a lot of that information.\n\n497\n00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.790\nNow Brian,\nas we again get ready for the exam.\n\n498\n00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:26.350\nAny final words on this particular\nlast two topics that we wantna\n\n499\n00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:30.720\nmake sure that we get into for\nthe watchers that are out there.\n\n500\n00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.740\n&gt;&gt; Well hopefully you guys\naren't tired of hearing this.\n\n501\n00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:37.980\nBut I think my recommendation here is\nflip this stuff on in your environment.\n\n502\n00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.970\nLet it run for a few days,\ncapture some data,\n\n503\n00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:44.500\nand then run back through it,\nget your hands on it, run these commands.\n\n504\n00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.938\nAnd that's one of the best ways that\nyou're gonna remember this stuff as you\n\n505\n00:31:47.938 --> 00:31:48.970\nprepare for the exam.\n\n506\n00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.128\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Brian,\nthank you again for\n\n507\n00:31:51.128 --> 00:31:53.355\nhelping us in all of\nthese different topics.\n\n508\n00:31:53.355 --> 00:31:56.850\nIt would've been a lot more difficult\nwithout you here helping us.\n\n509\n00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.000\nAnd thank you also for watching.\n\n510\n00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.090\nBut that's a great place for\nus to sign off for this episode.\n\n511\n00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.856\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n512\n00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:05.958\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Brian Svidergol.\n\n513\n00:32:05.958 --> 00:32:10.374\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned

[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:12.559\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.630\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ntaking a look at planning, deploying and\n\n7\n00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.140\ntroubleshooting coexistence with\nOffice 365 Exchange Online,\n\n8\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.110\nthat's quite a mouthful\nthat we chosen to do here.\n\n9\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.935\nAnd here with us is our Exchange expert,\nMr Brian Svidergol.\n\n10\n00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:38.660\nBrian help us out here when we start\ntalking about this idea of coexistence\n\n11\n00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.130\nwith Exchange Online and the Office 365\nportion, what do we really mean by that?\n\n12\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.669\nAnd where are we gonna\nbeginning this topic?\n\n13\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.110\nSo, here's situation with coexistence.\n\n15\n00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.891\nCoexistence is the idea that\nyou have something on premises,\n\n16\n00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:58.836\nlike your exchange environment, and\nthat you're gonna coexist it with another\n\n17\n00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:02.122\nenvironment such as\nOffice365 Exchange Online.\n\n18\n00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:03.828\nThat's coexistence.\n\n19\n00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:07.470\nAnd coexistence is a temporary state for\n\n20\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.810\nsome organizations that are going\nto move fully to the cloud.\n\n21\n00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.230\nAnd for other organizations it\ncould be a permanent thing.\n\n22\n00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.460\nWe're going to start off today by\nlooking at the hybrid configuration.\n\n23\n00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.570\nAnd I want to start off\nlooking at the diagram, and\n\n24\n00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.799\nwalk through some of the components.\n\n25\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.808\nSo, here is our diagram for\nour hybrid configuration.\n\n26\n00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:33.250\nOn the left-hand-side is our on\npremises implementation, and\n\n27\n00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.810\nI just want to point\nout a couple of things.\n\n28\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.360\nLet's start with the prerequisites for\nthat hybrid.\n\n29\n00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.900\nFirst of all,\non the mailbox server side down here,\n\n30\n00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.990\nwe have to have a supported version.\n\n31\n00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.340\nThat's the Exchange 2010 SP3, or newer.\n\n32\n00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.070\nExchange 2013 with the current cumulative\nupdate, or the previous cumulative update,\n\n33\n00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.070\nor of course 2016 current\ncumulative update, or previous.\n\n34\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.390\nThe other thing we need is\nan Office 365 subscription.\n\n35\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.543\nAnd the subscription that has\nExchange online is part of that.\n\n36\n00:02:07.543 --> 00:02:10.120\nA couple of other pieces\nI wanna point out.\n\n37\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.330\nThe domain name that we use here for\n\n38\n00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.460\nactive directory is commonly going to\nbe used out here in the cloud as well.\n\n39\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.370\nAnd, so one of the things that we need to\ndo is we need to get that domain name.\n\n40\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.640\nOut here in Office 365, there's a couple\nof prerequisites when you add it.\n\n41\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.380\nYou have to validate and\nprove that you own the domain.\n\n42\n00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.800\nAnd that's normally\ndone with a DNS record.\n\n43\n00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.150\nAnd then you run through a hybrid\nconfiguration wizard, and\n\n44\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.030\nwe're gonna run through that next.\n\n45\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.754\nAnd eventually, we're gonna synchronize\nour internal identities to act as your\n\n46\n00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:43.923\nactive directory.\n\n47\n00:02:43.923 --> 00:02:48.315\nIn this particular segment, we're actually\ngoing to walk through the trouble shooting\n\n48\n00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:51.593\nprocess of some of that, but\nthat requires an on premises server,\n\n49\n00:02:51.593 --> 00:02:55.270\nit requires the federation trust,\nand it requires this scene.\n\n50\n00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.520\nThere's a bunch of options tied\nto some of these components.\n\n51\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.520\nWe're going to be walking through them as\nwe move further along in this segment.\n\n52\n00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, Brian,\n\n53\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.920\nyou had mentioned this idea of\nhybrid configuration wizard.\n\n54\n00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.840\nWhat are some of the limitations that we\nto be aware of when we start talking about\n\n55\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.950\nwe're gonna make this thing happen for\nthis hybrid coexistence?\n\n56\n00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the hybrid configuration\nwizard is the simplified way\n\n57\n00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.323\nto take your on premises organization, and\n\n58\n00:03:25.323 --> 00:03:30.206\nconfigure it to be part of\nOffice 365 Hybrid Environment.\n\n59\n00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:32.874\nAnd I think,\none of the easiest ways to describe it and\n\n60\n00:03:32.874 --> 00:03:36.380\nshow it to you is just to walk\nthrough the actual configuration.\n\n61\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.780\nSo, we're going to take.\n\n62\n00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.299\nThe Huge Lab on-premises Exchange\nenvironment, and we're gonna run through\n\n63\n00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.492\nthe Hybrid Configuration Wizard to\nconnect it up with our Office 365.\n\n64\n00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:49.610\nAll right, so\nhere we are on mailbox server number one.\n\n65\n00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.600\nWe're gonna walk through\nthe Hybrid Configuration Wizard.\n\n66\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.830\nWe are in the Exchange\nadmin center on MBX one.\n\n67\n00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.900\nAnd we have navigated over here, now,\nwe can't see with this resolution, but\n\n68\n00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.260\nwe're in the hybrid section, which would\nnormally be displayed in the left pane.\n\n69\n00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.500\nWe are going to go ahead and\nclick configure.\n\n70\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.274\nWe need to sign into Office 365.\n\n71\n00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:14.226\nThis is gonna bring up a prompt.\n\n72\n00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.470\nAnd once we sign in, it brings us right\nback to the configuration component.\n\n73\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.236\nWe click configure again,\n\n74\n00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:49.960\nWe're gonna click here, and\nit's gonna download the application.\n\n75\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.406\nWe're gonna click Install.\n\n76\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.721\nRun.\n\n77\n00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:07.700\nAnd here is the official office 365\nhybrid configuration tool, get started.\n\n78\n00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.319\nWe are gonna get click next.\n\n79\n00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.720\nAnd here it detects the optimal\nExchange server to use.\n\n80\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.550\nNotice it grabs the version information.\n\n81\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.330\nEarlier we talked about some of\nthe prerequisites being on the cumulative\n\n82\n00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.750\nupdate, or the previous one.\n\n83\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.312\nWe're going to go ahead and click next.\n\n84\n00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:28.845\nAnd then we can use our\ncurrent credentials for\n\n85\n00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:31.090\nthe on-premises exchange environment.\n\n86\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.617\nWe are logged in as an exchange admin,\nso we are good here.\n\n87\n00:05:38.238 --> 00:05:42.042\nI'm gonna also reauthenticate here.\n\n88\n00:05:53.985 --> 00:05:58.521\nOkay, so, now, both environments\nare picked up, we're gonna click Next, and\n\n89\n00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:02.225\nthis is gonna gather configuration\ninformation from both sides,\n\n90\n00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:13.240\nThis is usually fairly quick.\n\n91\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.200\nThere it goes.\n\n92\n00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.240\nAnd both succeeded.\n\n93\n00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.915\nThat's what we wanna see.\n\n94\n00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:21.270\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n95\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.960\nAnd we have two options, minimal or full.\n\n96\n00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.330\nMinimal is the basic\nfoundation of Hybrid for us,\n\n97\n00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.155\nthat's what we gonna walk through\nespecially for the demonstration purposes.\n\n98\n00:06:32.155 --> 00:06:36.608\nFull includes all of the features that\na Hybrid gives you, some of the advanced\n\n99\n00:06:36.608 --> 00:06:41.282\neDiscovery feature we're actually gonna\ncover a few of those a little bit later.\n\n100\n00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:47.740\nAnd, now, we're gonna click update.\n\n101\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.372\nSo, these updates the configuration on\nboth sides to be in hybrid mode, and\n\n102\n00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:56.809\nif it completes successfully\nthen officially we're in hybrid.\n\n103\n00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:00.482\nAnd if you guys remember, we've covered\nsome features over the last couple of days\n\n104\n00:07:00.482 --> 00:07:08.413\nthat required us to be in hybrid mode\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n105\n00:07:08.413 --> 00:07:12.584\nBrian, while we're actually taking a look\nat this idea that configuration as\n\n106\n00:07:12.584 --> 00:07:15.300\nwe start to take a look\nat hybrid mode here.\n\n107\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.430\nWalking through the actual hybrid\nconfiguration wizard seems fairly easy as\n\n108\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.090\nlong as you actually realize,\nwhich particular mode that we need, right?\n\n109\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.090\nWhether we need the minimal,\nor the full install.\n\n110\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.490\nBut that's something we should we\ndecide during our planning, right?\n\n111\n00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nthat's another planning consideration.\n\n112\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.900\nFor a lot of environments,\n\n113\n00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.130\nyou're gonna go with the full hybrid\ndepending on what you're planning to do.\n\n114\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.421\nFor those that are gonna move\nto the cloud eventually, or\n\n115\n00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:42.624\nwanna have full services in\nthe cloud like mail boxes.\n\n116\n00:07:42.624 --> 00:07:44.233\nThen you want to go with the full,\n\n117\n00:07:44.233 --> 00:07:48.377\nif you're thinking about something like\narchive only, or just doing some testing,\n\n118\n00:07:48.377 --> 00:07:52.550\nor you're in the development environment,\nyou may not need it.\n\n119\n00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.766\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian,\nit looks like it's actually finished now,\n\n120\n00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:55.677\nso what's our next step?\n\n121\n00:07:55.677 --> 00:07:59.403\n&gt;&gt; So, we're totally done\nwith this topic and, I think,\n\n122\n00:07:59.403 --> 00:08:03.128\nwe should move on to our next\ntopic All right, so Brian,\n\n123\n00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:08.160\nour next topic is taking a look at\nthe idea of using authentication.\n\n124\n00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.490\nAnd we wanna focus in primarily\non using OAuth authentication.\n\n125\n00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.500\nSo when we start to take a look at this,\nis there a reason for\n\n126\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.630\nus choosing OAuth authentication?\n\n127\n00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.590\nIs there some functionality we don't get\nif we don't choose something like this?\n\n128\n00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.260\n&gt;&gt; Well what there is,\n\n129\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.400\nthere's a couple of features that\nrequire the use of OAuth authentication.\n\n130\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.190\nAnd in older versions of Exchange,\nin these situations,\n\n131\n00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:38.030\nyou had to take administrative action in\norder to turn on that OAuth configuration.\n\n132\n00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.070\nToday, since Exchange 2013,\n\n133\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.950\nCumulative Update 5,\nthis is all configured automatically.\n\n134\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.850\nAnd so there's a couple of\nfeatures that require this OAuth.\n\n135\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:49.980\nI'll give you one.\n\n136\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.072\nIf you have primary mailboxes on site,\nand then you have archived mailboxes in\n\n137\n00:08:54.072 --> 00:08:57.866\nthe Cloud, that's one situation\nwhere OAuth Authentication is used.\n\n138\n00:08:57.866 --> 00:08:59.783\nAnd there's a few just like that.\n\n139\n00:08:59.783 --> 00:09:03.638\nBut the good news is it's all\ndone automatically for you.\n\n140\n00:09:03.638 --> 00:09:07.121\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian, let me pull this\nfrom the end-user's perspective as well.\n\n141\n00:09:07.121 --> 00:09:12.171\nIf we are using some other type of\nauthentication, is the end-user gonna\n\n142\n00:09:12.171 --> 00:09:17.580\nexperience any differences that they're\ngonna notice if we switch to OAuth?\n\n143\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.110\n&gt;&gt; So the answer to that is no.\n\n144\n00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.790\nThis is a backend\nauthentication configuration.\n\n145\n00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.820\nIt's strictly for\n\n146\n00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.650\nthe server side infrastructure\ncomponents to offer this functionality.\n\n147\n00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.480\nThe end-user doesn't\nrealize what's happening.\n\n148\n00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, some of the other components\nthat we wanna make sure of, especially in\n\n149\n00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.600\nthis coexistence idea is to ensure that\nwe plan and configure certificates,\n\n150\n00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.120\nas well as some of the firewall\ncomponents for the Exchange setup.\n\n151\n00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.460\nYou can imagine that there would\nbe a bit of consideration for\n\n152\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.360\nthis, since we're trying to integrate\nwhat we normally would have on site,\n\n153\n00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.990\nas well as what we'd have,\nof course, in the cloud.\n\n154\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.050\nSo we don't actually have\na proper firewall set up, or\n\n155\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.240\nwe don't have the certificates\nthe way that we need to,\n\n156\n00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.780\nwe might find issues in the connectivity,\nas well as functionality kind of limited.\n\n157\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.409\nSo Brian, where do we need to start here?\n\n158\n00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, I have a video\ndiagram that I wanna show you, and\n\n159\n00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.380\nI wanna walk through some\nof these requirements.\n\n160\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:12.910\nLet's take a look.\n\n161\n00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.381\nSo here is our diagram,\n\n162\n00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:19.300\nwe've got on the left-hand side\nour on-premises environment.\n\n163\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.308\nOn the right-hand side,\nour Office 365 environment, and\n\n164\n00:10:22.308 --> 00:10:24.079\nI wanna point out a couple of things.\n\n165\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:30.420\nOne, when we think about mail flow\nbetween on-premises and Office 365,\n\n166\n00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.550\nand it doesn't matter where your mailboxes\nare, and you've got half and half.\n\n167\n00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.120\nBut you've gotta have\ncertificates on both sides, and\n\n168\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.810\nthese need to be third party certificates.\n\n169\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.340\nThis enables the mail flow,\n\n170\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:48.630\nthe secure mail flow between your Exchange\nservers and the Office 365 servers.\n\n171\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.710\nThe second piece on the certificates is,\nthe certificates that\n\n172\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.440\nyou have on the mailbox servers, they need\nto be deployed to your Edge transports.\n\n173\n00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.890\nThat's not necessarily always the case\nif you're not in a hybrid configuration.\n\n174\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.934\nA lot of times you might share, but\na lot of times you don't have to.\n\n175\n00:11:04.934 --> 00:11:05.692\nIn this case,\n\n176\n00:11:05.692 --> 00:11:10.070\nyou need that certificate from the mailbox\nis gonna be also on the Edge transport.\n\n177\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.590\nThen I'm gonna look at this\nMicrosoft Federation Gateway up here.\n\n178\n00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.191\nThat's what establishes our trust, and\n\n179\n00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:22.660\nwe can use a self signed certificate\nthere that's totally supported.\n\n180\n00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.160\nThat's actually the default.\n\n181\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.390\nBut be aware that there is\na certificate involved.\n\n182\n00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.620\nAnd then finally,\nlet's look at the communication.\n\n183\n00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.760\nI've circled two areas for the firewall.\n\n184\n00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.020\nOne is TCP port 25, that's what\nall your mail flow goes through.\n\n185\n00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.490\nSo that's a fairly common port.\n\n186\n00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.017\nYou guys are probably\nalready familiar with it.\n\n187\n00:11:44.017 --> 00:11:46.467\nAnd it's gonna be TCP port 25.\n\n188\n00:11:46.467 --> 00:11:51.570\nAnd you need that to go both directions\njust depending on your configuration.\n\n189\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.970\nThen you've got TCP port 443.\n\n190\n00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.850\nThat's for all your web-based traffic.\n\n191\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.574\nAnd that's gonna be for\nOutlook on the web.\n\n192\n00:11:59.574 --> 00:12:04.340\nIt's gonna be for EWS,\nall those Exchange backend services that\n\n193\n00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.860\nwe talked about in\nthe first couple of days.\n\n194\n00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.740\n&gt;&gt; Now, Brian, what if I actually have\nExchange Servers connected through\n\n195\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.030\nmultiple different forests?\n\n196\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:18.350\nCan I use the same certificates\nthroughout the entire structure there?\n\n197\n00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.138\n&gt;&gt; If you have multiple forests,\nthe answer is no.\n\n198\n00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:22.040\nYou do need to have separate\ncertificates there.\n\n199\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.457\nComplicates things a little bit.\n\n200\n00:12:23.457 --> 00:12:25.355\nBut with the multiple forest environment,\n\n201\n00:12:25.355 --> 00:12:27.464\nyou're already sort of\nin a complicated state.\n\n202\n00:12:27.464 --> 00:12:32.107\nI do wanna show one more thing\non the diagram I just realized.\n\n203\n00:12:32.107 --> 00:12:33.767\nAll right, so we're back here.\n\n204\n00:12:33.767 --> 00:12:38.399\nOftentimes you also deploy something for\n\n205\n00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:42.390\nauthentication like ADFS.\n\n206\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.812\nThat's also gonna have another\ncertificate that I'll draw up there.\n\n207\n00:12:46.812 --> 00:12:50.400\nAnd oftentimes that certificate is\na totally different certificate,\n\n208\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.890\nbecause it's got other URLs for\nthe authentication piece.\n\n209\n00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.540\n&gt;&gt; Now Brian, along with this, of course,\n\n210\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.210\nwe have to worry about our\ntransport services, too.\n\n211\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:06.300\nSo if there's a particular area\nthat when we start troubleshooting,\n\n212\n00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.270\nit may be the transport\nservices with Exchange Online.\n\n213\n00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.410\nWhere do we begin when we start\nhaving to deal with that?\n\n214\n00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.920\n&gt;&gt; So troubleshooting transport with\nExchange Online isn't all that unlike\n\n215\n00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.670\nwhat you do on-premises.\n\n216\n00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.129\nThe tools are similar, some of\nthe techniques are actually very similar.\n\n217\n00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:26.583\nOne thing you'll find it's that\ntroubleshooting transport in a hybrid\n\n218\n00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:31.704\nconfiguration especially, you might have\nto go on-premises and up to the cloud.\n\n219\n00:13:31.704 --> 00:13:33.746\nSo you might be doing something twice, but\n\n220\n00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:36.620\nyou definitely need to look\nboth places depending.\n\n221\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.290\nSo why don't we take a look at\nthe components on the computer\n\n222\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:40.899\nand walk through it?\n\n223\n00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:49.032\nSo in this case let's launch\nfrom the laptop here.\n\n224\n00:13:49.032 --> 00:13:54.839\nWe're gonna go up to the Office\n365 Exchange Admin center, so,\n\n225\n00:14:04.672 --> 00:14:06.855\nWe're gonna use a different account.\n\n226\n00:14:06.855 --> 00:14:08.352\nWe're gonna use our huge lab.\n\n227\n00:14:18.246 --> 00:14:21.330\nSo this gets us into the Office portal.\n\n228\n00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.760\nWe're gonna click Admin, and\nthat gets us to the admin portal.\n\n229\n00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.146\nAnd if you guys haven't\nbeen up here before,\n\n230\n00:14:29.146 --> 00:14:30.968\nsee if we can get that\na little bit bigger.\n\n231\n00:14:30.968 --> 00:14:34.696\nThere are actually\nindependent admin centers for\n\n232\n00:14:34.696 --> 00:14:37.630\neach of the services in Office 365.\n\n233\n00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.820\nWell, most of the services, right?\n\n234\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.080\nSo we really need to be in\nthe Exchange admin center.\n\n235\n00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.934\nAs we click that,\nthat opens up in a new tab.\n\n236\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:53.070\nBefore we start, take a look at\nthis admin center for a second.\n\n237\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.665\nIt probably looks pretty familiar to what\nwe've been walking through occasionally\n\n238\n00:14:56.665 --> 00:14:57.510\non-premises.\n\n239\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.541\nAnd it really is.\n\n240\n00:14:58.541 --> 00:15:01.989\nWe're gonna go down to the Mail Flow tab.\n\n241\n00:15:01.989 --> 00:15:05.508\nWe're gonna go over to Message Trace.\n\n242\n00:15:05.508 --> 00:15:08.653\nAnd we're gonna create a trace.\n\n243\n00:15:08.653 --> 00:15:11.710\nLet's go past seven days.\n\n244\n00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.500\nAnd with this trace, what we're doing is\nwe're trying to track down incoming and\n\n245\n00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.940\noutgoing messages.\n\n246\n00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.720\nWhat we can do is we can specify a date\nrange, or do a custom date range.\n\n247\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.380\nWe can specify the delivery status,\nso if I wanna see everything, or\n\n248\n00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.470\nif I just wanna see pending failed,\nanything that was a little bit off,\n\n249\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.300\nwe can filter it down to that.\n\n250\n00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.450\nThis environment hasn't had\na lot of activity up here, so\n\n251\n00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:33.520\nwe're gonna stick with all.\n\n252\n00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.182\nAnd then we can also filter by\nthe sender or the recipient.\n\n253\n00:15:38.182 --> 00:15:40.899\nSo when you're troubleshooting mail\nflow sometimes you wanna do that,\n\n254\n00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:44.140\nespecially once you've got amount\nof traffic coming through here.\n\n255\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.990\nWe're gonna just leave it as any sender,\nany recipient, and we will search.\n\n256\n00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.639\nAnd here we have the results.\n\n257\n00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:56.656\nWe've got some emails from\nBrian@swordigo.com here.\n\n258\n00:15:56.656 --> 00:16:01.301\nYou can see the status over here,\ndelivered to subject, the recipient and\n\n259\n00:16:01.301 --> 00:16:03.378\nWe don't have a lot of failures.\n\n260\n00:16:03.378 --> 00:16:07.766\nWe do have one failure, and\nyou can double click these things and\n\n261\n00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:10.500\nget a much better status.\n\n262\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.370\nSo you can see Office 365\nreceived the message but\n\n263\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:18.320\ncouldn't deliver it to due to\nthe following error, Recipient not found.\n\n264\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.970\nThis was an expected situation because\nin the middle of configuring hybrid for\n\n265\n00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.670\nHuge Lab, Office 365, right now,\n\n266\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.580\nbelieves that it's hosting Huge Lab but\nin reality it's on-premises.\n\n267\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.130\nSo this was to be expected.\n\n268\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.003\nI just wanted to generate a little\nactivity up here to show you what message\n\n269\n00:16:37.003 --> 00:16:41.638\ntracing can do as you're kind of tracking\nmessages falling in and out of Office 365.\n\n270\n00:16:41.638 --> 00:16:45.340\nOn the on-premises side,\nyou're gonna do something very similar.\n\n271\n00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.330\nYou're gonna go to\nthe Exchange Admin Center and\n\n272\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.590\nyou're gonna trace some messages, maybe\nyou're gonna use a message tracking log.\n\n273\n00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.570\nWe looked at that previously, so we\nprobably don't need to take a look again.\n\n274\n00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.908\n&gt;&gt; All right Brian, is it fairly similar,\nthen, when we have to troubleshoot,\n\n275\n00:16:58.908 --> 00:17:02.210\nlet's say, the client access\non Exchange Online as well?\n\n276\n00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.830\nSo we've already done that\npreviously with the on-premises but\n\n277\n00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.750\nwhat about with Exchange Online?\n\n278\n00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.680\nIs this kind of very similar or\nis this different?\n\n279\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.450\n&gt;&gt; It's actually gonna be very similar.\n\n280\n00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:16.260\nWe have some of the same tools that you\ncan use to troubleshoot either side.\n\n281\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.470\nWe're gonna go down to\nthe computer here and\n\n282\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.220\nwe're gonna get into our\nclient operating system.\n\n283\n00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.117\nThis is Client1, we're calling it.\n\n284\n00:17:25.342 --> 00:17:30.037\nAnd we're gonna go up to,\nmy enhance security is enabled.\n\n285\n00:17:30.037 --> 00:17:31.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not cool.\n\n286\n00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.226\nLet me see if I can.\n\n287\n00:17:35.735 --> 00:17:39.750\nOkay, give me one second here.\n\n288\n00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.450\nGet to Server Manager,\nI'm gonna need to turn that off, just so\n\n289\n00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.110\nI can get this site fully functional.\n\n290\n00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.010\nAnd this is a little trick when it\nsays it's off already, I flip it on,\n\n291\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.240\ncome back here, I flip it off, and\n\n292\n00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.260\nthen I relaunch my browser.\n\n293\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:03.990\nAnd there we go.\n\n294\n00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.187\nAll right, we're gonna go up to\n\n295\n00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:13.480\ntestconnectivity.microsoft.com.\n\n296\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.450\nThis is the Remote Connectivity Analyzer.\n\n297\n00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:23.070\nWe walked through this a couple\nof times for other scenarios.\n\n298\n00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.851\nNow, we're specific to\nthe Office 365 scenario, so\n\n299\n00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:29.776\nwe are gonna click on the Office 365 tab.\n\n300\n00:18:32.171 --> 00:18:34.860\nAnd we're going to do the Outlook\nconnectivity test down here.\n\n301\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.680\nAnd then we're going to click, Next.\n\n302\n00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.840\nWe're going to need to fill\nin some information up here,\n\n303\n00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.970\nour email address is\nadmin@hugelab.onmicrosoft.com\n\n304\n00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.089\nthat's cuz we haven't transferred our\ndomain name all the way up there yet.\n\n305\n00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.512\nMicrosoft account is actually the same,\nlet's do a Copy Paste.\n\n306\n00:18:57.414 --> 00:18:59.148\nOur super secret password.\n\n307\n00:19:01.995 --> 00:19:03.387\nWe'll stick with auto discover so\n\n308\n00:19:03.387 --> 00:19:06.060\nyou won't have to type in all\nof our server information.\n\n309\n00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.590\nClick the check box,\nwe've looked at that before, and then,\n\n310\n00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.325\nfinally, hope that we\ncan solve this CAPTCHA.\n\n311\n00:19:11.325 --> 00:19:14.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n312\n00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie,\n\n313\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.470\nare you seeing what I'm seeing here?\n\n314\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.985\nLet's do one new one.\n\n315\n00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:22.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I can't see that one.\n\n316\n00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.920\nThat may be a little bit better.\n\n317\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.200\n&gt;&gt; This looks a little better.\n\n318\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.998\n&gt;&gt; The other one looked like Sanskrit.\n\n319\n00:19:28.998 --> 00:19:31.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's hope this works, and\n\n320\n00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.560\nif it does, we have 30 minutes of testing.\n\n321\n00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.527\nOkay, we are now gonna\nperform the test and\n\n322\n00:19:37.527 --> 00:19:43.474\nas soon as this comes back I'll zoom in if\nour font isn't big enough, but we'll see.\n\n323\n00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.903\n&gt;&gt; So what is this helping us to test for\nat this point, Brian,\n\n324\n00:19:49.903 --> 00:19:52.640\nas we're taking a look at what's going on?\n\n325\n00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.960\n&gt;&gt; So what this does,\nit tests the Outlook connectivity\n\n326\n00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.780\nto Office 365 based on that\nadmin mailbox and credential.\n\n327\n00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.150\nValidating network connectivity,\nvalidating the certificate,\n\n328\n00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.680\nvalidating all the DNS lookups,\nthe Autodiscover settings.\n\n329\n00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.055\nAll the stuff that Outlook expects and\n\n330\n00:20:10.055 --> 00:20:12.380\nneeds in order to get\nconnected to the email data.\n\n331\n00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.480\nAll right so\nit looks like our test succeeded.\n\n332\n00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.190\nAnd what you'll see here is Connectivity\nTest Successful with Warnings.\n\n333\n00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:26.640\nI mentioned this a couple of days back,\nit's very common to have warnings or\n\n334\n00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.960\neven errors when everything\nis working as expected.\n\n335\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.410\nThat's because the number of checks\nthis thing performs is quite extensive.\n\n336\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.390\nLet's go ahead and expand them all and\nwalk through what we have here.\n\n337\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:43.650\nOne of the first things it does is look\nfor Autodiscover, because that's how it's\n\n338\n00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.540\ngoing to find the server, the mailbox,\nall the information to get connected.\n\n339\n00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.850\nThat was successful.\n\n340\n00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.670\nIt goes through a few different\nconfigurations for Autodiscover.\n\n341\n00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.500\nTesting the various URLs that are\npotentially in use as long as it finds one\n\n342\n00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.630\nand it's functional, we're good.\n\n343\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.960\nI'm gonna scroll down a bit here.\n\n344\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.680\nYou can see that network tests\nlike testing TCP port 80,\n\n345\n00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.070\nit's listening and open.\n\n346\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.730\nScrolling, then we go through\nthe certificate trust,\n\n347\n00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.900\nremember all this stuff\nis in Office 365 now.\n\n348\n00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.384\nSo you can see on the certificate\nthis is an outlook.com certificate\n\n349\n00:21:20.384 --> 00:21:25.194\ncompared to earlier where had\nhugelab.net on-premises certificate.\n\n350\n00:21:27.636 --> 00:21:32.583\nAnd we have the XML being\npulled down from Autodiscover.\n\n351\n00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:34.947\nLet me just scroll down,\ndo a couple more things here.\n\n352\n00:21:38.169 --> 00:21:40.260\nTesting MAPI over HTTP.\n\n353\n00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.950\nSo remember, we did the Outlook test and\n\n354\n00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.470\nthat gives us the MAPI over HTTP test,\nwhich is one way to connect up Outlook.\n\n355\n00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.454\nAnd the other one is the Outlook Anywhere,\nwhich is RPC over HTTP,\n\n356\n00:21:52.454 --> 00:21:54.241\nwhich this also tests.\n\n357\n00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.420\nAnd here is our testing RPC over HTTP.\n\n358\n00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.280\nEverything going to Office 365.\n\n359\n00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.040\nSo by all intents and\npurposes, for all intents and\n\n360\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.070\npurposes, the test was successful,\neverybody's happy, this thing's working.\n\n361\n00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.090\nBut this tool is where\nyou want to start and\n\n362\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.690\ntest all your connectivity\nfrom the client pieces.\n\n363\n00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian, we have one more\ntopic to cover in this particular episode,\n\n364\n00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.250\nwhich is, of course,\nDirectory Synchronization.\n\n365\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.390\nAnd we might need to begin\nwith troubleshooting that,\n\n366\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.500\nthere's issues that go on.\n\n367\n00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.770\nSynchronizing might be\none of the big ones.\n\n368\n00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.600\nSo Brian, where do we begin?\n\n369\n00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.350\n&gt;&gt; Alright so where do we begin\nwith Directory Synchronization?\n\n370\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:40.200\nWell its an interesting topic, you know\nthere's not a lot of coverage on the exam\n\n371\n00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.040\nbut there is a dedicated section for\ntroubleshooting it.\n\n372\n00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.320\nAnd makes it tough because you don't\nsee the initial set up process and\n\n373\n00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.040\nsome of the initial configuration,\nit's just straight into troubleshooting.\n\n374\n00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.210\nWe're gonna walk through some\nof those troubleshooting steps.\n\n375\n00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.720\nAnd first, let me give you\njust a high level overview of\n\n376\n00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.860\nwhat Directory Synchronization\nactually entails.\n\n377\n00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.180\nIt's Azure Active Directory Connect,\nthat's a free download from Microsoft.\n\n378\n00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.440\nYou install it on a tool, it doesn't\nneed to be a domain controller or\n\n379\n00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.710\nan Exchange server.\n\n380\n00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.420\nTypically it's a utility\nserver of some sort and\n\n381\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.620\nthat tool takes your on-premises\nActive Directory information,\n\n382\n00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.780\nsynchronizes it and\npushes it up to Azure Active Directory.\n\n383\n00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:27.150\nYou need to have Global Administrative\nAccess up in Office 365 and\n\n384\n00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:32.880\nyou also need an administrative account\non-premises for that initial installation.\n\n385\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.890\nAnd once you have the thing configured\nit will sync every 30 minutes up\n\n386\n00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.750\nto Azure Active Directory and\nit's based on your configuration.\n\n387\n00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.540\nIt can be all users and devices,\nit can be some users and\n\n388\n00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:50.236\ndevices, it can be based on a group or\njust some specified OUs.\n\n389\n00:23:50.236 --> 00:23:54.299\nSo without further ado, that's the intro,\nlet's look at the computer and\n\n390\n00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:56.403\ntake a walk through some of this stuff.\n\n391\n00:23:56.403 --> 00:24:00.525\nSo we are on Util1,\nthat's our Utility server, and\n\n392\n00:24:00.525 --> 00:24:03.187\nit is our Azure AD Connect Server.\n\n393\n00:24:03.187 --> 00:24:08.211\nThe first thing I wanna do is I'm gonna\nlaunch the Azure AD connect tool.\n\n394\n00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:10.639\nAnd we're gonna look at the configuration.\n\n395\n00:24:10.639 --> 00:24:14.359\nI think, this is helpful especially for\nthose that haven't set this up or\n\n396\n00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:15.870\nseen it before.\n\n397\n00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.790\nOne of the things I wanna point out\nright from the beginning is that,\n\n398\n00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.420\nwhen I launch this\nsynchronization is disabled.\n\n399\n00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.560\nSo once I'm done in here,\nI wanna close it back out so\n\n400\n00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.880\nsynchronization is enabled again.\n\n401\n00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.537\nWe're gonna click Configure and\n\n402\n00:24:28.537 --> 00:24:31.210\nwe're gonna click View\nthe current configuration.\n\n403\n00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:38.851\nSo, here's our high-level configuration,\nyou can see that we're\n\n404\n00:24:38.851 --> 00:24:43.496\nsynchronizing the hugelab.net domain and\nit's going up to Azure AD.\n\n405\n00:24:43.496 --> 00:24:47.984\nAnd, this is the admin account\nthat I used for the set up.\n\n406\n00:24:47.984 --> 00:24:50.849\nAnd then we have some of our\nsynchronization settings.\n\n407\n00:24:50.849 --> 00:24:55.357\nSome of these are tied to your\nsynchronization configuration.\n\n408\n00:24:55.357 --> 00:24:58.816\nI wanna point out a couple, I wanna make\nthis a little smaller so I can zoom in and\n\n409\n00:24:58.816 --> 00:25:05.234\nhighlight a couple of things Okay,\nso when we look at stuff\n\n410\n00:25:05.234 --> 00:25:10.740\nlike DEVICE WRITEBACK, these are optional\nfeatures of the directory synchronization.\n\n411\n00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.640\nYou can enable them or you don't have to.\n\n412\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.070\nAll of these optional features\nare disabled by default.\n\n413\n00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.660\nThe one that we do have\nenabled required for\n\n414\n00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.840\nthe hybrid deployment Is this one,\nEXCHANGE HYBRID DEPLOYMENT.\n\n415\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.293\nSo, during the installation and\nthe configuration, I specifically selected\n\n416\n00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:32.022\nthat one knowing that I wanted to\ndo a Hybrid with Exchange Online.\n\n417\n00:25:32.022 --> 00:25:37.070\nAnd then this last one I wanna show\nyou too, PASSWORD SYNCHRONIZATION.\n\n418\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:41.410\nSo, not only are we\nsynching to Office 365 and\n\n419\n00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.650\nAzure AD but, we're also authenticating\nand we have a couple of options there.\n\n420\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.140\nOne, we can do password synchronization,\n\n421\n00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.680\nwhich is what this lab\nenvironment is configured for.\n\n422\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.360\nWhat that means is,\npart of the sink, it takes a secured\n\n423\n00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.180\nhash of your password hash,\nsyncs it up to Azure AD.\n\n424\n00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.200\nSo when I go up to Azure AD,\nI can log on with my\n\n425\n00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.040\nhuge lab credentials because\nthey've been synchronized up there.\n\n426\n00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.460\nBut, it's still two separate accounts.\n\n427\n00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.690\nEarlier, we talked about ADFS and\n\n428\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.160\nthere were other solutions too\nthat you could use instead.\n\n429\n00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.120\nBut, the big picture here is that\nwe got password synchronization,\n\n430\n00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.200\nwe've got the Hybrid configuration.\n\n431\n00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.120\nAnd now, I wanna show you a little bit\nmore than just that initial configuration.\n\n432\n00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.015\nLet's drop back to the computer.\n\n433\n00:26:28.484 --> 00:26:31.262\nSo, we're gonna Exit out out of here and\n\n434\n00:26:31.262 --> 00:26:36.480\nI wanna show you when you have this\ninstalled, what ends up happening?\n\n435\n00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:42.030\nYou end up with a single service and\nit's called Microsoft Azure AD Sync.\n\n436\n00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.000\nIt's Running, it's set to Automatic.\n\n437\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.680\nAnd, you can see that it's logging\non as a service account and\n\n438\n00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.250\nthat service account actually\nlives in Azure Active Directory.\n\n439\n00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.190\nSo, part of your trouble shooting,\nis the service running?\n\n440\n00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.696\nIf it is,\nyou always can optionally stop it and\n\n441\n00:26:58.696 --> 00:27:01.149\nstart it as you would\nany other application.\n\n442\n00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:03.232\nOkay, that's one component.\n\n443\n00:27:03.232 --> 00:27:08.730\nNow I wanna show you another tool which\nis the Synchronization Service Manager.\n\n444\n00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.770\nThis is the tool that keeps track of\nall your syncs, all your activities,\n\n445\n00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.630\nwhat's going on and logs the changes,\n\n446\n00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:21.030\nthe adds,\nall the items that happen during a sync.\n\n447\n00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.800\nSo I'm gonna scroll down\nhere to our initial sync,\n\n448\n00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.780\nwhere we have a little bit of data.\n\n449\n00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.950\nOkay, so this is a little bit earlier,\nwe can see that this is a full import.\n\n450\n00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.980\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit here.\n\n451\n00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:39.670\nSo, right here it tells you whether it's\na full import or a Full Synchronization.\n\n452\n00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.520\nThat's the initial all these right\nhere are the initial set up and\n\n453\n00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.310\nfirst run, right?\n\n454\n00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.535\nAfter that, we do a bunch of\ndelta imports and delta syncs.\n\n455\n00:27:48.535 --> 00:27:53.925\nThese are basically when changes happen,\nokay?\n\n456\n00:27:53.925 --> 00:27:55.496\nWanna show you a little bit more here.\n\n457\n00:27:55.496 --> 00:28:00.549\nYou can click on all this underlined blue\nstuff and take a look at what happened.\n\n458\n00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:06.302\nSo let's click here and here are the total\nobject retrieved from the directory.\n\n459\n00:28:08.062 --> 00:28:09.191\nThere's quite a bit of stuff.\n\n460\n00:28:09.191 --> 00:28:11.550\nWe have a bunch of users in here.\n\n461\n00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:15.680\nSo this configuration actually said,\ngrab everything and sync it up.\n\n462\n00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.370\nThat way, whoever I want to\nput up there with a mailbox,\n\n463\n00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.730\nthey're up there ready to authenticate.\n\n464\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.530\nThat's one more area.\n\n465\n00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:26.236\nSo, without getting crazy\nin this particular piece,\n\n466\n00:28:26.236 --> 00:28:30.598\nI just wanted to show you some of\nthe key troubleshooting areas.\n\n467\n00:28:30.598 --> 00:28:35.310\nIs the service running, what did the last\none look like, were there any errors,\n\n468\n00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:39.282\nwe're a bunch of people removed or\na bunch of people added, right?\n\n469\n00:28:39.282 --> 00:28:42.858\nIs the service running,\nis the service account valid,\n\n470\n00:28:42.858 --> 00:28:44.844\nis that locked out in Azure AD?\n\n471\n00:28:44.844 --> 00:28:47.162\nThose are the basics for\ntroubleshooting and\n\n472\n00:28:47.162 --> 00:28:50.761\nI think also look at the configuration\nlike we did initially because in\n\n473\n00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:54.550\nthe configuration you can validate\nthat you still have Exchange hybrid.\n\n474\n00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.800\nThe configuration hasn't changed\nall those kinds of things.\n\n475\n00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian, well,\n\n476\n00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:02.950\nthat's a lot of information when we start\ndealing with the idea of coexistence\n\n477\n00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:07.772\nwith Office 365 and Exchange Online\n&gt;&gt; Remember that what you saw\n\n478\n00:29:07.772 --> 00:29:11.596\nhere in this episode is that, we saw\nBrian help us with just dealing with\n\n479\n00:29:11.596 --> 00:29:16.268\nthe aspects of understanding what a Hybrid\nconfiguration is going to be dealing with.\n\n480\n00:29:16.268 --> 00:29:21.188\nWhich, of course, is our on-premises\nexchange as well as integrating in\n\n481\n00:29:21.188 --> 00:29:26.107\nof course to some of our Office365s\nExchange Online and in that in the way\n\n482\n00:29:26.107 --> 00:29:30.969\nhe showed us is how we can begin by\nusing the Hybrid Configuration Wizard.\n\n483\n00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:33.980\nHe walked us through the settings\nto get us setup there.\n\n484\n00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.070\nAnd what we're looking for\nat the end of that is that both sides were\n\n485\n00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.850\nable to successfully get\nthe information that they need.\n\n486\n00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.640\nAnd that they could actually\nconfigure what they needed to for\n\n487\n00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.310\nthat exchange to go on.\n\n488\n00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:48.600\nHe also emphasized the importance of using\nsomething like OAuth authentication.\n\n489\n00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.270\nBecause without it,\n\n490\n00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:53.530\nsome of the different services would\nnot run the way that they need to.\n\n491\n00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:58.050\nAnd of course, firewall and\ncertificates always a big consideration.\n\n492\n00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:01.360\nRemember those firewall rules,\nthey have to be open for\n\n493\n00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:07.450\nport 443 and of course, for port 25, those\nare things that we also wanna consider.\n\n494\n00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:11.040\nAnd then, just troubleshooting\njust the other things, right?\n\n495\n00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.690\nTransport rules as well as\nthe client access and then lastly,\n\n496\n00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:20.480\neven directory synchronization which is a\nbig part of just getting everything set up\n\n497\n00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.870\nand making sure it's working.\n\n498\n00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.350\nDirectory synchronization Brian\nis probably one of the areas I've\n\n499\n00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:28.100\nhad issues with in the past but glad\nyou asked, you helped me out there too.\n\n500\n00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.410\nAll right, Brian, as we get ready for\nthe exam, any last minute test, to seems\n\n501\n00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:37.380\nlike something I could possibly get set\nup in the home lab and even run through.\n\n502\n00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.500\nIt doesn't seem like this\nis a gigantic set up,\n\n503\n00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.340\nis there anything else\nthat we can do here?\n\n504\n00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you nailed it, Ronnie.\n\n505\n00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.620\nWhich is, get your hands on it,\ndownload the stuff,\n\n506\n00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.670\nthe synchronization tool is totally free,\nyou can actually synchronize\n\n507\n00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.670\nwithout having to have any kind of\nAzure Active Directory Premium.\n\n508\n00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.103\nSo, I would definitely walk through this.\n\n509\n00:30:56.103 --> 00:30:59.946\nWhat you normally find is,\nthe prerequisites and some of the initial\n\n510\n00:30:59.946 --> 00:31:03.808\nsetup will really help you in\nthe troubleshooting scenarios later.\n\n511\n00:31:03.808 --> 00:31:06.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian.\n\n512\n00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.450\nThank you again for\nhelping us out with this.\n\n513\n00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.968\nAnd thank you also for watching.\n\n514\n00:31:09.968 -->

Sure, sure, so Exchange Federation,\nthink of it as a trust.\n\n14\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.453\nAnd what you do is you take\nyour exchange organization and\n\n15\n00:00:42.453 --> 00:00:45.118\nyou trust it with another\nexchange organization.\n\n16\n00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:50.308\nOne of the simplest ways to do that is\nto start your federation with Microsoft.\n\n17\n00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:53.512\nMicrosoft Federation Services\nis up in the cloud.\n\n18\n00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:58.100\nThey got a new name for it now, the Azure\nActive Directory Authentication Services.\n\n19\n00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.131\nBut the idea here is that you\ntake your exchange orb and\n\n20\n00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:07.580\nyou have it trust Microsoft and\nanybody else that does the same thing.\n\n21\n00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.510\nIf everyone trusts Microsoft,\nyou guys are now in a position\n\n22\n00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.960\nto share stuff amongst each other\nas though it was a direct trust.\n\n23\n00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.274\nSo I've got a diagram,\nlet's walk through it for a second.\n\n24\n00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:23.423\nSo we've got company number\none over here on the left,\n\n25\n00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:26.540\ncompany number two on the right.\n\n26\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.450\nAnd each has their own\nexchange organization, and\n\n27\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.260\nwhat they want to establish\nis a relationship so\n\n28\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.430\nthey can share free busy information,\nokay?\n\n29\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.110\nAnd the establishment is\na self signed certificate, and\n\n30\n00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.580\na very quick click through\nthe exchange administrative center.\n\n31\n00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.460\nI'm gonna actually show that\npiece in our next topic.\n\n32\n00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.968\nSo after each company establishes\nthat federation trust.\n\n33\n00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:58.413\nNow they can establish the policies\nbetween the order like sharing\n\n34\n00:01:58.413 --> 00:02:00.200\nthe information.\n\n35\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.587\nSo this is high level what it looks like,\none certificate each,\n\n36\n00:02:03.587 --> 00:02:06.985\na quick configuration in\nthe exchange administrative center.\n\n37\n00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:10.140\nAnd then you're often ready\nto go to the next piece,\n\n38\n00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.671\nwhich is establishing sharing policies and\norganisation relationship.\n\n39\n00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:18.165\n&gt;&gt; Now what do we mean\nby this idea of sharing?\n\n40\n00:02:18.165 --> 00:02:22.461\nNow that we've got everything kind of\ntrusting, are we talking about the ability\n\n41\n00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:26.019\nto limit what we share or\nis this something else we're trying to do?\n\n42\n00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're talking about,\nby default we don't share anything, right?\n\n43\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.117\nSo the only sharing that's taking\nplace is inside the organization.\n\n44\n00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:40.098\nSo when we talk about sharing, we're\ntalking about taking the information in\n\n45\n00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:43.882\nour users mailboxes and\nsharing it with external parties.\n\n46\n00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:49.896\nAnd typically that's calendar or\ncontact information.\n\n47\n00:02:49.896 --> 00:02:53.400\nSo let's get started on\nthe sharing policies.\n\n48\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.100\nI wanna show you visually what\nwe're sorta talking about.\n\n49\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.190\nBring the drop down to the computer,\nmailbox server number one.\n\n50\n00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.548\nAnd here we are in\nthe exchange admin center.\n\n51\n00:03:06.548 --> 00:03:10.790\nWe're gonna navigate over to organization\nand then we're gonna go to sharing.\n\n52\n00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.630\nAnd this is, and I'm gonna back\nout of here just a little bit,\n\n53\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.750\nso we can do a zoom.\n\n54\n00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.570\nThis piece right here,\n\n55\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.385\nthat Federation Trust that I just\ndescribed on the other side.\n\n56\n00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:27.150\nIn a default environment\nwhen we first come in here,\n\n57\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.386\nthis would actually say Federate,\nif I remember the button correctly.\n\n58\n00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:36.448\nBecause you have to click that,\nthat establishes the Federation initially.\n\n59\n00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:41.070\nAfter you establish that,\nthis is where we're at here.\n\n60\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.012\nSo now, we have federation,\nthe trust with Microsoft, but\n\n61\n00:03:45.012 --> 00:03:49.826\nwe don't ave any sharing, except\nthe default sharing policy down here.\n\n62\n00:03:49.826 --> 00:03:52.170\nAnd that's what I wanna talk about first.\n\n63\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.200\nSo this default sharing policy,\nit's individual sharing.\n\n64\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.955\nSo for example, if Ronnie wanted\nto share his calendar with me and\n\n65\n00:03:59.955 --> 00:04:03.795\nI'm on the Internet, he could use\nindividual sharing to do that.\n\n66\n00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:07.970\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat we mean by sharing.\n\n67\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.430\nSo here we have the domains and\nthis one's anonymous, so\n\n68\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.200\nthis is calendar sharing with free busy\ninformation and it's with anybody.\n\n69\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.720\nAnd you can see our options here,\n\n70\n00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.280\nwe can share all calendar appointment\ninformation, time, subject,\n\n71\n00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.710\nlocation, and title or we can limit\nit a little bit with time only.\n\n72\n00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.910\nSo time only would be if Ronnie is\ntrying to set up lunch with me, right?\n\n73\n00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.173\nHe can figure out if I'm free or busy, but\n\n74\n00:04:35.173 --> 00:04:38.030\nhe can't tell what's\nblocking out the time slots.\n\n75\n00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.460\nSo that's one example, and\nthis is all individual sharing.\n\n76\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.408\nSo beyond individual sharing when\nyour partnering with a company or\n\n77\n00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:52.187\nyou guys are working closely with another\norganization you wanna do it more than on\n\n78\n00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:53.587\nthe individual level.\n\n79\n00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:54.917\nYou wanna establish and\n\n80\n00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:59.241\norganization relationship where you\ncan look up the availability for 10 or\n\n81\n00:04:59.241 --> 00:05:03.790\n12 people in a big meeting that's\ngoing across the companies.\n\n82\n00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.730\n&gt;&gt; Now Brian, if I am connected in in the\nway that you showed in that diagram where\n\n83\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.860\nwe're all connected through\nthe Microsoft itself.\n\n84\n00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.961\nAnd that makes it easy for federation,\nis this in terms of the organizational\n\n85\n00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:20.634\nrelationship how we pick the organization\nthat we wanna share with?\n\n86\n00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:22.632\nIs that what we're talking about there?\n\n87\n00:05:22.632 --> 00:05:27.050\nBecause it seems like just anybody could\njust say, hey, I want to share with Brian.\n\n88\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.830\nAnd they could just connect and\ndo whatever they wanted to.\n\n89\n00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.927\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the organization sharing\npiece isn't done in the Federation.\n\n90\n00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:34.780\nIn the Federation,\n\n91\n00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.260\nthe only thing we're doing is\nestablishing a trust with Microsoft.\n\n92\n00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.770\nWhat that gets us is the ability to\nfederate with any other organization\n\n93\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.680\nthat has also established a trust\nwith Microsoft at Federation.\n\n94\n00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.800\nNow that we've done that, what I wanna do\nis I want to establish an organization\n\n95\n00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.460\nrelationship and\nkinda show you what we're talking about.\n\n96\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.740\nSo let's drop back down to the computer.\n\n97\n00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.840\nSo we're in the same spot, but this\ntime we're doing organization sharing.\n\n98\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.438\nWe're going to click on add cuz\nwe don't have any right now.\n\n99\n00:06:03.438 --> 00:06:08.764\nAnd we're gonna specify the relationship\nname and the domain name.\n\n100\n00:06:08.764 --> 00:06:11.002\nWe gonna go svidergol.com and\n\n101\n00:06:11.002 --> 00:06:15.139\nwe gonna enable counter free\nbusy sharing information.\n\n102\n00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.004\nAnd then we gonna choose who can\nuse it and what we are sharing.\n\n103\n00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:23.845\nIn this case, let's go ahead and\nshare everything in our calender and\n\n104\n00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:27.059\nwe gonna it for\neveryone in the organization.\n\n105\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.730\nIf desired, you can actually limit\nthis to just a special security group.\n\n106\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.174\nThis might be if you're maybe\npartnering with an organization and\n\n107\n00:06:37.174 --> 00:06:40.738\nyou want the legal team or the executive\nteam only to start talks, and\n\n108\n00:06:40.738 --> 00:06:43.645\neventually go company wide\nthat's available for you.\n\n109\n00:06:43.645 --> 00:06:47.631\nNow that we've ended our information\nwe are gonna click Save,\n\n110\n00:06:53.168 --> 00:06:54.916\nAnd this goes through fairly quickly.\n\n111\n00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:58.514\nAnd it should show up in our list\nof organization relationships here.\n\n112\n00:07:02.415 --> 00:07:04.950\nAnd we are there.\n\n113\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.770\nSo you can see that we've got it\nestablished with svidergol.com.\n\n114\n00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.165\nAnd we can delete that,\nrefresh it get the settings.\n\n115\n00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:18.262\nEdit those free busy sharing details if we\nwant, and we can establish more than one.\n\n116\n00:07:18.262 --> 00:07:22.370\nWe can establish it with a bunch of\ncompanies if that is our intention to do.\n\n117\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.560\n&gt;&gt; Now Brian, we had already talked\nabout the idea of certificates and\n\n118\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.900\nfirewall requirements\nin a previous episode.\n\n119\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.650\nAre there any different ones\nthat we have to worry about\n\n120\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.710\nwhen we deal with Federation services?\n\n121\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've talked a lot about\ncertificate and firewall requirements,\n\n122\n00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.356\nvarious topics like Hybrid.\n\n123\n00:07:40.356 --> 00:07:44.880\nAnd even initial setup, so\nthese are very similar.\n\n124\n00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.859\nOn the certificate side, we're talking\nabout third party certificates.\n\n125\n00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:52.485\nSelf-signed for Federation's also allowed,\nthat's the default.\n\n126\n00:07:52.485 --> 00:07:58.620\nOn the firewall side,\nthe only thing we need is TCP port 443.\n\n127\n00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.137\nAnd we need that inbound to the mail box\nservers on both sides of the relationship.\n\n128\n00:08:03.137 --> 00:08:07.476\nYou can use the reverse proxy or some\nother device in the perimeter to initially\n\n129\n00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:09.789\nbring that connection into the network.\n\n130\n00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:12.570\nBut eventually you need that\n443 to the mail box service.\n\n131\n00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the other thing\nthat we also want to do then is,\n\n132\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.270\nlet's say that we think that everything\nis set up the way that it want to.\n\n133\n00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.504\nBut yet, we realize that for one reason or\nanother, the Federation Trust or\n\n134\n00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:27.433\nthe organizational\nrelationship isn't working.\n\n135\n00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:30.957\nWhere do we begin with the trouble\nshooting process here in terms of those\n\n136\n00:08:30.957 --> 00:08:32.130\ntwo items?\n\n137\n00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:37.360\n&gt;&gt; So where we start is certificates and\nfirewall, right?\n\n138\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.871\nIs the certificate expired?\n\n139\n00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:44.070\nHas a firewall been updated, something\nbeen changed, is the connectivity broken?\n\n140\n00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.494\nSo that's where you wanna start.\n\n141\n00:08:45.494 --> 00:08:47.310\nWanna make sure\nthe certificates are trusted.\n\n142\n00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.280\nWe've gone through some of\nthat stuff in the past.\n\n143\n00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.980\nAnd then let's drop down to the computer,\n\n144\n00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.170\nI'll show you a couple of\nother items to check as well.\n\n145\n00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.423\nSo we're on mailbox server number one,\nwe're at the PowerShell prompt.\n\n146\n00:08:58.423 --> 00:09:03.117\nWe're gonna get FederationTrust, and\n\n147\n00:09:03.117 --> 00:09:08.647\nI'm gonna limit\nthe information a little bit.\n\n148\n00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:12.646\nLet's go token and web,\n\n149\n00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:17.030\nstill a little bit of data.\n\n150\n00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.416\nSo what I wanna show you are just\na couple of the settings in our\n\n151\n00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:27.350\nFederation Trust with Microsoft and\nlet me scroll down just a little bit.\n\n152\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.046\nYou can see the live ID,\nthis is a reference to Microsoft.\n\n153\n00:09:31.046 --> 00:09:37.897\nThis is the certificate, and then we have\nMetadata Microsoft Online Federation.\n\n154\n00:09:37.897 --> 00:09:42.320\nMetadata is tells you that we've\ngot a Federation with Microsoft.\n\n155\n00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.010\nLiveID is the original\nauthentication system we know\n\n156\n00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.390\nthat they got a new name now, and\nthey've got their information here.\n\n157\n00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.110\nSo that's one thing,\nwhen you do get the Federation,\n\n158\n00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.200\nyou wanna make sure you actually see it,\nright?\n\n159\n00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.990\nSo in troubleshooting,\n\n160\n00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:01.055\nyou wanna look at it and you can see\nthe certificate details right in here.\n\n161\n00:10:01.055 --> 00:10:07.435\nSo this is a brand new certificate,\nnot before 7/18, and then it expires here.\n\n162\n00:10:07.435 --> 00:10:09.934\nBut if you were to come in here and\nthis certificate was expired,\n\n163\n00:10:09.934 --> 00:10:12.218\nwell that would be a serious problem,\none place to start.\n\n164\n00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:15.369\nAnd then let's take\na look at one more thing.\n\n165\n00:10:15.369 --> 00:10:20.867\nSo get-federationInformation,\n\n166\n00:10:20.867 --> 00:10:28.960\nand we're gonna get\nhugelab.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n167\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.720\nThis can sometimes take\na couple of moments.\n\n168\n00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.569\nBut this is another way to gather\na little bit of data back,\n\n169\n00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:38.942\nmake sure everything checks out,\nmake sure you don't see any anomalies.\n\n170\n00:10:43.334 --> 00:10:46.898\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhile this particular string is running.\n\n171\n00:10:46.898 --> 00:10:50.231\nLet's go ahead and review some of\nthe concepts that we've already\n\n172\n00:10:50.231 --> 00:10:53.530\ntaken a look at in terms of\nthe Federation Services here.\n\n173\n00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.800\nRemember that we wanna make sure\nof course that first and foremost,\n\n174\n00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.760\nthat we understand that\nidea of the Federation,\n\n175\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.640\nthat we're really not connecting\ndirectly to another organization.\n\n176\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.760\nBut it's really about connecting\ninto what we see online for\n\n177\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.773\nMicrosoft, and that makes it easy then for\nus to connect.\n\n178\n00:11:09.773 --> 00:11:12.086\nOnce we all have\na connection to Microsoft,\n\n179\n00:11:12.086 --> 00:11:16.380\nthen we can trust those other\norganizations and make that happen.\n\n180\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.255\nWe can also establish\nthe sharing policies,\n\n181\n00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:20.833\nas well as those organizational\nrelationships that we need.\n\n182\n00:11:20.833 --> 00:11:24.845\nAnd the great thing is also,\nthe idea here of firewall and\n\n183\n00:11:24.845 --> 00:11:27.114\nthose certificate issues too.\n\n184\n00:11:27.114 --> 00:11:30.591\nThat we don't really have to change a lot,\nexcept for\n\n185\n00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:33.912\nmaking sure that port 443 is on and open.\n\n186\n00:11:33.912 --> 00:11:36.650\nAll right so\nI believe that everything is now run and\n\n187\n00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:37.950\nwe are ready to take a look, right?\n\n188\n00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are.\nSo here we are back at the computer.\n\n189\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.953\nIt finished processing and\njust wanna show you that what we get here.\n\n190\n00:11:46.953 --> 00:11:52.706\nWe get our onmicrosoft domain name and\nthen we get the auto discovery URL.\n\n191\n00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:55.805\nAnd we have the federation\ninformation here.\n\n192\n00:11:55.805 --> 00:11:58.685\nIsValid is set to true,\nthat's what you wanna see.\n\n193\n00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:02.640\nThis doesn't bring a whole\nbunch of information back.\n\n194\n00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.451\nBut it's one of those things that\nyou wanna make sure it's valid.\n\n195\n00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:08.021\nYou wanna make sure it brings\nback the data, doesn't air out,\n\n196\n00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:09.147\nall those kinds of things.\n\n197\n00:12:09.147 --> 00:12:13.839\nSo for the trouble shooting aspects,\nI think we've probably covered it.\n\n198\n00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:18.091\n&gt;&gt; All right, another aspect of what\nwe're gonna be covering as well in this\n\n199\n00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:23.080\nparticular episode is gonna be trouble\nshooting Cross Forest Availability.\n\n200\n00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.660\nNow Brian, I need your help here.\n\n201\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.830\nWhat do we really mean by this\nidea of cross force availability?\n\n202\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.471\n&gt;&gt; So the cross force availability is\nthat idea I presented a few minutes ago.\n\n203\n00:12:33.471 --> 00:12:38.240\nWhere one organization wants to share\ntheir free busy information with another.\n\n204\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.400\nAnd their two independent force,\ntwo independent exchange organizations.\n\n205\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.100\nThis particular exam topic is focused on,\nwe've got the Federation in place.\n\n206\n00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.893\nWe've established the organizational\nstuff, we've got the sharing, but\n\n207\n00:12:50.893 --> 00:12:52.067\nnow it's not working.\n\n208\n00:12:52.067 --> 00:12:53.193\nHow do you troubleshoot that?\n\n209\n00:12:53.193 --> 00:12:54.726\nSo that's what this one is all about.\n\n210\n00:12:54.726 --> 00:12:56.538\n&gt;&gt; All right,\ncan you show us what you really mean?\n\n211\n00:12:56.538 --> 00:12:59.358\nCuz even as you describe it,\nit makes sense to me, but\n\n212\n00:12:59.358 --> 00:13:01.379\nseeing it might actually help us out.\n\n213\n00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.299\nSure, so let's drop down to the computer.\n\n214\n00:13:04.299 --> 00:13:07.443\nI'm gonna show you guys client 1, and\n\n215\n00:13:07.443 --> 00:13:11.649\nin this situation,\nI'm logged on as Tom.Zeller.\n\n216\n00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:16.910\nAnd I'm gonna try to get a lunch meeting\nwith this fellow named Brian Svidergol.\n\n217\n00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:24.838\nAnd let's see,\nhow about 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock.\n\n218\n00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:28.988\nLet a little bit of a late lunch and\nwe're gonna shoot for Friday.\n\n219\n00:13:28.988 --> 00:13:33.760\nNow I'm gonna use the scheduling assistant\nto figure out if he's available.\n\n220\n00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:40.039\nNow, I'm gonna zoom in just a little bit\nhere and I wanna show you something.\n\n221\n00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.710\nSee, these squiggly lines?\n\n222\n00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.760\nWhat it indicates is my system\ncan't communicate with his and\n\n223\n00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.310\nthus, I have no idea if Brian's available.\n\n224\n00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:57.630\nSo if you actually highlight the little\nsquiggly, this is a fairly small thing.\n\n225\n00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.779\nLet me see if I can zoom out and\ndo it again here.\n\n226\n00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.911\nAs you can see it says, No free busy\ninformation could be retrieved,\n\n227\n00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:09.744\nrecipient server could not be determined.\n\n228\n00:14:09.744 --> 00:14:12.322\nContact your administrator.\n\n229\n00:14:12.322 --> 00:14:15.472\nIf we did have that\ncross-forest sharing in place,\n\n230\n00:14:15.472 --> 00:14:20.784\nyour organizational relationships, I would\nbe able to figure out if he was available.\n\n231\n00:14:20.784 --> 00:14:23.727\nAnd I could even see the meeting\ninformation depending on those\n\n232\n00:14:23.727 --> 00:14:26.110\nsharing settings recovered earlier.\n\n233\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.780\nSo that is it in a nutshell.\n\n234\n00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.007\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nis there anything more specifically or\n\n235\n00:14:32.007 --> 00:14:36.670\nlooking at as far as components go\nwhen we start this process as well?\n\n236\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.450\nSo you did show us that's\nwhere we're gonna see.\n\n237\n00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.810\nBut are we looking for\nanything in particular?\n\n238\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so when you're\ntroubleshooting crossforce stability,\n\n239\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.220\nthere's two things that\nyou wanna focus on.\n\n240\n00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.380\nOne, is the availability service.\n\n241\n00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.982\nAnd that's a background process, it run\nand handles all the inbound request for\n\n242\n00:14:54.982 --> 00:14:57.070\nfree busy information.\n\n243\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.515\nAnd as long as you have the configuration\nin place the availability servers,\n\n244\n00:15:00.515 --> 00:15:04.320\nwe'll handle the request and\nprovide the information cross for us.\n\n245\n00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.900\nThe other one is EWS,\nExchange Web Services.\n\n246\n00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.530\nWe've talked about that one I think on day\none, it's one of the backend web services.\n\n247\n00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.900\nAnd when you're troubleshooting EWS,\nyou want to start with the basics, right?\n\n248\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.360\nYou wanna look at the external URL\nespecially in a cross four situation,\n\n249\n00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.615\nmake sure that's valid.\n\n250\n00:15:21.615 --> 00:15:26.235\nYou wanna make sure that EWS F2QDN\nit's part of your certificate.\n\n251\n00:15:26.235 --> 00:15:27.814\nIs your certificate still valid?\n\n252\n00:15:27.814 --> 00:15:30.415\nYou wanna go through all the basics for\nEWS.\n\n253\n00:15:30.415 --> 00:15:34.998\nAnd if all else fails,\nstart taking a look at your event log.\n\n254\n00:15:34.998 --> 00:15:39.515\n&gt;&gt; All right Brian, well that's a lot of\ninformation for us to consider when we\n\n255\n00:15:39.515 --> 00:15:44.440\nstart having to take a look at of course,\nthe Exchange Federation Services.\n\n256\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.503\nDo you remember that in this episode,\nwe did talk briefly about the very idea,\n\n257\n00:15:48.503 --> 00:15:51.906\nof course, of the Federation Trust\nthat we need to have, right?\n\n258\n00:15:51.906 --> 00:15:56.509\nWith the Azure Active Directory\nauthentication system that once our\n\n259\n00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:59.060\norganizations are connected there.\n\n260\n00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.920\nIt makes it very easy then, for two\norganizations to also trust each other.\n\n261\n00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.386\nBrian also showed us to\nadd ability of course,\n\n262\n00:16:06.386 --> 00:16:09.815\nto go ahead to make sure that we\ncreate sharing policies as well.\n\n263\n00:16:09.815 --> 00:16:12.498\nCuz by default we're not sharing anything,\nand\n\n264\n00:16:12.498 --> 00:16:15.516\nthen the organizational\nrelationships that we need.\n\n265\n00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:18.989\nAs well as the firewall and\nof course certificate considerations.\n\n266\n00:16:18.989 --> 00:16:23.904\nAnd then we took a look briefly here\nat those different relationships, and\n\n267\n00:16:23.904 --> 00:16:26.799\nwhere we'd have to troubleshoot them too.\n\n268\n00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:30.319\nAnd that's when we also took a look at\nsome of the different aspects of that,\n\n269\n00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:32.580\nespecially checking those port numbers.\n\n270\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.270\nAnd lastly,\nBryan also showed us of course,\n\n271\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:40.210\nthe idea here of cross-force\navailability troubleshooting.\n\n272\n00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.480\nCuz those are also things\nwe need to know too.\n\n273\n00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.410\nSo Brian, in terms of taking a look\nat this information in particular,\n\n274\n00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.770\nthis may be a little bit more\ncomplex to set up in a home lab.\n\n275\n00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.644\nAny pointers that you can help us out, so\n\n276\n00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:55.748\nthat we might be able to see this\na little bit better even on our own.\n\n277\n00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:59.539\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the easiest ways to\ngo through this in preparation for\n\n278\n00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:03.120\nthe exam is to obtain\nan Office 365 subscription.\n\n279\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.966\nThat gets you easy access to some of\nthe sharing right in your administrative\n\n280\n00:17:06.966 --> 00:17:10.167\nconsole without having to go\nthrough the whole set up process.\n\n281\n00:17:10.167 --> 00:17:15.039\nSo if it's possible, that's something\nworth doing even if you do a trial or\n\n282\n00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:16.571\nsomething for a month.\n\n283\n00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:19.636\nIt will at least allow you to get\nyour hands on it and play with it.\n\n284\n00:17:19.636 --> 00:17:24.059\n&gt;&gt; All right, Brian, well thank you for\nthat tip as we get ready for that exam.\n\n285\n00:17:24.059 --> 00:17:26.218\nAnd thank you also for watching.\n\n286\n00:17:26.218 --> 00:17:30.108\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n287\n00:17:30.108 --> 00:17:31.478\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.940\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today you're\ntaking a look at planning, deploying,\n\n8\n00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.200\nand troubleshooting\non-premises co-existence with\n\n9\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.270\nearlier versions of Microsoft Exchange.\n\n10\n00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.059\nAnd here to help us out with that\nentire topic is gonna be Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.020\nBrian our exchange expert.\n\n12\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.210\nBrian, welcome back to the show and\nhelp us out.\n\n13\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.590\nThat was a mouthful to actually try and\ndo.\n\n14\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.470\nAnd I don't I could repeat it again.\n\n15\n00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.515\nI'm just happy that you\ntook that one Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:47.570\n[LAUGH] Glad to here\ncovering this topic today.\n\n17\n00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.050\nOkay so the whole coexistence\nwith earlier versions\n\n18\n00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.330\nwe are gonna start today on name spaces.\n\n19\n00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:59.375\nAnd namespace is, here's the deal\nwith namespace as an earlier version.\n\n20\n00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:04.025\nIf you go back a couple of versions,\nespecially all the way back to 2007,\n\n21\n00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:07.755\nnamespace planning for\ncoexistence was complex.\n\n22\n00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:12.830\nIt had a requirement that you had to\nuse a legacy domain name, and Often\n\n23\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.550\nhad to change out your certificates, your\nSAN certificates with the legacy name and\n\n24\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.200\nall the new names and\nthen redeploy them to all the servers.\n\n25\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.340\nIt made it a little bit challenging.\n\n26\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.380\nLuckily for us, Exchange 2016\nsimplifies that whole process.\n\n27\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.130\nWe no longer have that consideration for\nthe legacy host name.\n\n28\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.740\nBut, there are a couple things that I\nwanna walk through, I've got a diagram and\n\n29\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.270\nlet's talk through it.\n\n30\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.390\nSo we're looking at a coexistence\nenvironment, and we've got Exchange 2010.\n\n31\n00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.300\nIt doesn't matter if it's 2010 or\n2013 and then here on the bottom,\n\n32\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.800\nwe have introduced Exchange 2016.\n\n33\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.130\nSo a couple of key points in\nthis coexistence environment.\n\n34\n00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.530\nWhen you have a mailbox on 2010,\n\n35\n00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.710\nlike the guy on the left here, you can\ngo to either server and get his email.\n\n36\n00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.400\nWhen your mailbox is one\n2016 after a mailbox move,\n\n37\n00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.340\nyou have to go straight to the mailbox\nserver that's running on 2016.\n\n38\n00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.160\nSo that's a little bit of information for\nplanning those name spaces.\n\n39\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.210\nBecause if your name spaces all\nresolve to say, any exchange server in\n\n40\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.920\nyour environment, well that could pose\na problem in a scenario like this.\n\n41\n00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.520\nOkay, with regard to\nthe rest of the name spaces.\n\n42\n00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.720\nLet's talk through those a little bit.\n\n43\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.060\nI listed them out under number\nthree here on the bottom.\n\n44\n00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.010\nWe've got auto discover, Outlook Anywhere.\n\n45\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.270\nThe whole list, we've kind of talked\nthrough those through the days.\n\n46\n00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.970\nI want to just talk from\nthe coexistence perspective,\n\n47\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.780\nthe idea that it's a temporary state.\n\n48\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.120\nAnd that at some point,\nyou're going to want to take away all that\n\n49\n00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.030\nold legacy exchange equipment and\nbring in 2016.\n\n50\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.230\nAnd it's part of that,\nthat name space planning,\n\n51\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.920\nis which name spaces do you cut over first\nAnd what the whole over process look like?\n\n52\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.330\nI would like to point out one thing here,\nauto discover is usually the first name\n\n53\n00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.310\nspace that you bring over to exchange 2016\nand that is usually one of the safest.\n\n54\n00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.800\nAfter that you usually bring the rest of\nthem in bulk it may be cut over weekend or\n\n55\n00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.210\nsomething similar.\n\n56\n00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.110\nSo high level namespace planning be\nthinking in the order you bring them over.\n\n57\n00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.190\nBe thinking about your certificates so\nthat you can have\n\n58\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.310\nall your Exchange environment, the old and\nthe new, all on the same certificate.\n\n59\n00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.110\n&gt;&gt; Now, Brian, with actually trying\nto implement something like this\n\n60\n00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.210\nwith a previous version, and\nnow of course Exchange 2016.\n\n61\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.070\nWe also may need to consider,\nof course, then planning and\n\n62\n00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.330\nconfiguring for proxy redirection as well.\n\n63\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.250\nAnd it's an element that we really\nneed to make sure that we cover.\n\n64\n00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.320\nSo Brian what is it that\nwe need to understand here?\n\n65\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.510\n&gt;&gt; So this topic we've covered\na little bit in the past.\n\n66\n00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.900\nAnd this one, what this exam has,\n\n67\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.840\nit takes some of these same topics and\nshoves them in to different categories.\n\n68\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.900\nSome for hybrid, some for coexistence,\nand some just for implementing and\n\n69\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.160\nplanning your Exchange 2016 environment,\nright.\n\n70\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.190\nSo, the good news is we can take some\nof the same concepts from earlier and\n\n71\n00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.530\napply them in this case.\n\n72\n00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.638\nI have a new diagram, I'm going to walk\nthrough the proxy and redirect, right now.\n\n73\n00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:14.060\nOkay, so here is our diagram.\n\n74\n00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.540\nThis is an all new proxy redirect diagram.\n\n75\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.660\nYou guys probably remember that.\n\n76\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.400\nWe have our user here, he comes in\ninitially to any mailbox server,\n\n77\n00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.450\nand then he is proxy back\nto whatever his mailbox is\n\n78\n00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.870\nAs long as the sites\nare not internet facing.\n\n79\n00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.790\nIf he has an internet facing site,\n\n80\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.240\nthen he can be redirected\nall the way to that server.\n\n81\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.440\nAll this proxy redirect\nstuff happens seamlessly.\n\n82\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.930\nSo For coexistence,\nthere's not a whole lot changing here.\n\n83\n00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:57.140\nI did cover one thing earlier,\nwhich is that 2016 can proxy for\n\n84\n00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.019\n2010 or 2016 or 2013.\n\n85\n00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.876\nBut if you go back to 2010, most of\nthe time what you're gonna find is that\n\n86\n00:05:05.876 --> 00:05:09.910\nthe older versions can't proxy for\nthe newer versions.\n\n87\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.140\nAnd so you have to account for\n\n88\n00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.190\nthat when you're directing people through\nthe environment to get their email.\n\n89\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.840\n&gt;&gt; Another issue that we\nmight not have considered,\n\n90\n00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.470\nespecially as we're running this idea of\na coexistence a type of infrastructure\n\n91\n00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.610\nhere is also doing the firewall\ntypes of planning as well.\n\n92\n00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.390\nSo in earlier versions Brian, we have to\nworry about different follow ports or\n\n93\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.320\nwe actually need to do when we have\nthis idea of the older version and\n\n94\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.290\nthe newer versions in this\nspecial considerations there.\n\n95\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.930\nThe only special consideration are if\nthat more serves to deal with.\n\n96\n00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.050\nAnd when you first bring 2016 in, all your\nfirewall rules are probably setup just for\n\n97\n00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.540\nyour legacy environment.\n\n98\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.740\nSo you need to alter, you've got all the\ndifferent ports of 25, the AD, the 443 you\n\n99\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.530\nneed to open those up for the new servers\nand make sure all of it is included.\n\n100\n00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.190\nOnce you've done your migration or\ncut over,\n\n101\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.960\nyou take out all the old equipment out\nof the firewall rules and you're good.\n\n102\n00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.770\nLet's look at the firewall\nchart in a diagram and\n\n103\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.970\nwalk through some of those ports.\n\n104\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.250\nOkay, so here we have what we\ncall the core services and\n\n105\n00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.390\nthey are all listed here on the left.\n\n106\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.179\nAnd then we have the protocol, TCP or UDP,\nand then we list out the port numbers.\n\n107\n00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.850\nSome of you guys obviously,\n\n108\n00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.380\nmost of you guys are gonna know\nthe standard ports 80, 443, 25.\n\n109\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:40.018\nBut we're still getting into POP3\nsecure point 995 and IMAP secure 993.\n\n110\n00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:42.990\nThat might get a little murky for\nsome people,\n\n111\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.509\nnot everyone memorizes those things.\n\n112\n00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.905\nAnother one down here is authenticated\nSMTP from the clients on 587.\n\n113\n00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:55.608\nSo, not that you need to remember\nall these or memorize them, but\n\n114\n00:06:55.608 --> 00:07:00.140\nthere is a chance that you could\nsee some ports on the exam.\n\n115\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.130\nSo having a little table like this,\n\n116\n00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.030\nlooking at it before you walk\ninto the exam, not a bad idea.\n\n117\n00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:12.310\nOne thing on the DNS, it's the only\none that has both TCP and UDP.\n\n118\n00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.660\nSo be aware of that,\n\n119\n00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.340\nthat's another thing on the firewall\nside that's you've gotta account for.\n\n120\n00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.110\n&gt;&gt; The other thing that we also want to\nconsider of course is having to deal with\n\n121\n00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.610\nthe idea of mailflow requirements.\n\n122\n00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.140\nSo with Exchange 2016, we've already\ngone through that in earlier episodes.\n\n123\n00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.520\nBut now that you're talking\nabout earlier versions, and\n\n124\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.790\nof course the current version of Exchange.\n\n125\n00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.460\nWe need to be able to understand\nhow this affects our mail flow and\n\n126\n00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.990\nwhat we need to configure for.\n\n127\n00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.570\nSo, Brian, help us out here.\n\n128\n00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.646\n&gt;&gt; So, mail flow requirements\n&gt;&gt; I think the easiest way is to think\n\n129\n00:07:46.646 --> 00:07:50.358\nthem through is let's go to the virtual\nwhite board and draw out and\n\n130\n00:07:50.358 --> 00:07:52.760\ntalk through some of these requirements.\n\n131\n00:07:55.118 --> 00:07:59.044\nAll right, so the white board is up and\n\n132\n00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:02.978\nI first want to talk about MX records.\n\n133\n00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:05.462\nSo, earlier, we've kind of drawn this out.\n\n134\n00:08:05.462 --> 00:08:07.350\nWe've got an MX record here.\n\n135\n00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.929\n10 going to your old exchange, say 2013.\n\n136\n00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:18.178\nSo, when we think about mail flow, and\nwe've brought 2016 into the environment.\n\n137\n00:08:18.178 --> 00:08:21.021\nOne of the first things we've got\nto think about is the MX record.\n\n138\n00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:22.830\nSo that's step one.\n\n139\n00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.750\nI'm gonna actually leave that up.\n\n140\n00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.720\nWe also have connectors.\n\n141\n00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.290\nSo send connectors, say to the internet,\n\n142\n00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:38.030\nnormally list out the servers\nthat are authorised to send.\n\n143\n00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.660\nRight?\nSo you're gonna have your old servers\n\n144\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.630\nlisted out as authorized to\nsend email out to the internet.\n\n145\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.403\nWhen you bring your new servers in over\nhere on 2016, you're going to need to\n\n146\n00:08:47.403 --> 00:08:52.123\nupdate your connectors, so that they\nauthorize your new servers to also send.\n\n147\n00:08:52.123 --> 00:08:58.835\nAnd that's going to be whether\nyou're sending or receiving, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:58.835 --> 00:09:00.544\nI'm going to erase this stuff and\nkeep going.\n\n149\n00:09:03.005 --> 00:09:08.510\nSo another thing I wanna\ntalk about is SMTP relay.\n\n150\n00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.930\nSo, many organizations\nspecify one Exchange server\n\n151\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.060\nin all the other servers\nuse it to send emails.\n\n152\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.300\nWell now you brought 2016 in over here.\n\n153\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.730\nAnd you've got a couple of\nupdates to make here right.\n\n154\n00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:28.070\nYou probably have to update a DNS record,\nmaybe it's SMTP.yourdomain.com or\n\n155\n00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.670\nsomething like that and\nyou want that DNS to point down here.\n\n156\n00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.800\nBut you're also going to have to\nconfigure the IP address space for\n\n157\n00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.250\nauthorized senders.\n\n158\n00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.210\nSo let's list that out.\n\n159\n00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:45.660\nIP addresses, and if you don't have\nthis DNS, you're going to have to\n\n160\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:51.190\nupdate all these clients with the IP\naddress of the new SMTP server.\n\n161\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.060\nThe one running on 2016.\n\n162\n00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.694\nSo let me erase this and\nsee if we have any additional stuff here.\n\n163\n00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:04.737\nI think that's probably a good coverage\nfor mailflow, it's a lot of stuff to take\n\n164\n00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:08.960\nin and hopefully the whiteboard\nhelps visualize some of that stuff.\n\n165\n00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.230\n&gt;&gt; Now, as we start to integrate\neverything together as far\n\n166\n00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.130\nas this coexistence goes.\n\n167\n00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.260\nOne of the things that we do want to\nalso do is of course is to move earlier\n\n168\n00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.460\nmailboxes to the current edition\nof Microsoft Exchange as well.\n\n169\n00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.000\nSo what do we need to plan for\nin terms of mailbox move or migration.\n\n170\n00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.900\n&gt;&gt; So for migration, there is\nquite a lot of planning aspect and\n\n171\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.480\nthings to think about, right?\n\n172\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.680\nSo one, you want to figure out how\nyou are going to do you mailbox.\n\n173\n00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.340\nAre you gonna move them in batches?\n\n174\n00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.310\nAre you gonna move them all at once?\n\n175\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.680\nYou're gonna have a cut over weekend.\n\n176\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.710\nTypically, smaller environments, couple\nhundred mailboxes, maybe two, three,\n\n177\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.520\nfour hundred mailboxes,\nyou can do a cut over weekend.\n\n178\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.260\nFriday night, everybody goes home.\n\n179\n00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.180\nMonday morning, they come back in.\n\n180\n00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.160\nThey're up on 2016.\n\n181\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.810\nNobody knows what happened.\n\n182\n00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.875\nIn bigger organizations though,\nthat's not always gonna work.\n\n183\n00:10:57.875 --> 00:11:02.530\nYou got 10, 20,000 mailboxes,\nyou're gonna move them in batches.\n\n184\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.500\nAnd planning for batches is something that\nrequires a little bit of consideration.\n\n185\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.960\nOne, how do you move all\nthe mailboxes to 2016 and have\n\n186\n00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:17.440\nall your database sizes match up and\nalign and minimize downtime for the users.\n\n187\n00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.580\nManage all of the quotas and all of\nthe other things that users are used to.\n\n188\n00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.040\nThat's gonna take some time.\n\n189\n00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.210\nSo I wanna walk through a couple things,\nsome commands.\n\n190\n00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:33.110\nLet's drop down to the computer and\ntake a look at mailbox server number one.\n\n191\n00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:38.170\nSo one of the planning components\nis getting your mailboxes and\n\n192\n00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.680\nfiguring out on DB1 here.\n\n193\n00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.450\nLet's go to -Database DB1.\n\n194\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.870\nAnd you wanna figure out how big they are,\nhow many you have.\n\n195\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.680\nSo we're gonna use\na Get-MailboxStatistics.\n\n196\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.710\nThere it is and\nthen I'm gonna format a table and\n\n197\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:01.080\nsay display name total item size.\n\n198\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.050\nAnd this is one database maybe this\nis the first database I wanna move,\n\n199\n00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.740\nmaybe this data base is on is the last\ndatabase on one of my mailbox servers.\n\n200\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.550\nSo I wanna find out who's on it, figure\nout how much data I'm working with and\n\n201\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.080\nthen plan out those moves.\n\n202\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.180\nSo this command gives me all\nthe mailboxes and their total item size.\n\n203\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.820\nNotice that yellow lettering\nthat warning text,\n\n204\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.098\nwe have a few mailboxes on\nthe database that never logged in.\n\n205\n00:12:28.098 --> 00:12:31.140\nTypically you won't see that often\nin a production environment,\n\n206\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.790\nthis being a lab environment we just\nhave a bunch of tests stuff out there.\n\n207\n00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.430\nSo, we've got a few with some size.\n\n208\n00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.040\nWe're looking at a couple megs, some KB,\nright, at the lab environment but\n\n209\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.170\nnormally you're working with gigabits.\n\n210\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:47.440\nAnd what you're trying to identify is how\nmuch total data is there, how long is it\n\n211\n00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.120\ngoing to take to copy across and do I have\nenough room on the destination server.\n\n212\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.200\nCan I move all this stuff on\ndatabase one on the old server?\n\n213\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.420\nTo a single database on the new server?\n\n214\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.460\nOr am I gonna have to actually break\nthese up with some kind of spreadsheet?\n\n215\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.400\nLet me move on a little bit here.\n\n216\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:11.660\nSo next, let's say I've identified,\nthat my God, a few mailboxes.\n\n217\n00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.300\nThere's not that much data.\n\n218\n00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.430\nLet's look at how you\ncan move these things.\n\n219\n00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.020\nSo we're gonna, get mailbox database DB1,\n\n220\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.749\nwe are gonna specify a New-MoveRequest.\n\n221\n00:13:23.749 --> 00:13:31.232\nWe are gonna specify a TargetDatabase,\nwe are gonna put, everybody on DB10.\n\n222\n00:13:31.232 --> 00:13:34.496\nWe are gonna give this Batch-Move a name,\n\n223\n00:13:34.496 --> 00:13:39.766\nI normally like to say which database\nthe source is of DB1 to DB10.\n\n224\n00:13:39.766 --> 00:13:43.796\nThat way if I look at it later, I can at\nleast identified where things were coming\n\n225\n00:13:43.796 --> 00:13:45.800\nfrom and where they are supposed to go.\n\n226\n00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.960\nI'm going to set a BadItemLimit, so\n\n227\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.260\nwhen you move a mailbox you might\ncome across bad items, corrupt items.\n\n228\n00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.860\nYou can either have the mailbox\nmove completely stopped or\n\n229\n00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.960\nyou can accept a few bad items and\nkeep moving.\n\n230\n00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.340\nIn general what I have found you\nneed to accept some bad items.\n\n231\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.761\n50 is a pretty good number that balances\ndata loss and functionality and\n\n232\n00:14:10.761 --> 00:14:13.337\nactually getting this process complete.\n\n233\n00:14:13.337 --> 00:14:18.166\nAnd then we're gonna say CompleteAfter and\n\n234\n00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:24.454\nwe're gonna say 03/18/2017 10:00AM.\n\n235\n00:14:24.454 --> 00:14:28.860\nAnd this particular window aligned\nwith my change request that I put in\n\n236\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.730\nnd has been approved.\n\n237\n00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.120\nSo that's good.\n\n238\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.640\nWe're going to go ahead and kick that off.\n\n239\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.600\nYou can see that we get information\nabout when an item can't be read,\n\n240\n00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.600\nlet me scroll back up to that.\n\n241\n00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.460\nWhen an item can't be\nread from the source,\n\n242\n00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.350\nit can't be written to the destination,\nit's considered corrupted.\n\n243\n00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.520\nThat's where that bad item limit comes in.\n\n244\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.659\nSo you can see if it's out\na few of these mailboxes,\n\n245\n00:14:50.659 --> 00:14:53.293\nsome of these have never been logged into.\n\n246\n00:14:55.615 --> 00:14:59.230\nAnd we have one mailbox that all\nready has a completed move request.\n\n247\n00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.770\nI can show you that in\na couple more minutes.\n\n248\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.250\nCompleted move request.\n\n249\n00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.500\nI've moved a few mailboxes in between,\nit didn't clear them out.\n\n250\n00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.140\nThe rest of these are waiting for\nthe pickup job,\n\n251\n00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.200\nwhich is that date that we specified.\n\n252\n00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.939\nSo, there you have.\n\n253\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.270\nWe'll call it one small\nbatch of moving mailboxes.\n\n254\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.490\nAnd now,\nwhat I wanna show you is the third part.\n\n255\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.500\nSo now we've said DB1\nis on the old server.\n\n256\n00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.720\nWe wanna eliminate that.\n\n257\n00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.696\nWe're gonna move everything to DB10, but\n\n258\n00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:29.440\nI need one more command to\nkind of complete the process.\n\n259\n00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.260\nSet mailbox database DB1 and then we're\n\n260\n00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:39.635\ngonna use the IsExcluded\nfrom provisioning.\n\n261\n00:15:39.635 --> 00:15:40.970\nThere it is.\n\n262\n00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.340\nAnd we're gonna set that to true.\n\n263\n00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.370\nSo, what that does.\n\n264\n00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.710\nYou guys remember how we have\nbeen creating new mailboxes,\n\n265\n00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.720\nnot specifying a database, and\nExchange sort of chooses it for us?\n\n266\n00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.671\nThis makes sure Exchange\ndoesn't choose DB1 anymore.\n\n267\n00:15:56.671 --> 00:15:59.519\nBecause we're moving everybody\noff DB1 to a new database and\n\n268\n00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:03.185\nwe want to get rid of the server that\nDB1's on, I don't want any more mailboxes\n\n269\n00:16:03.185 --> 00:16:07.066\nbeing automatically placed there,\ncuz I'm just gonna have to move them.\n\n270\n00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:11.710\nSo that gives you a high level look\nat the process of planning and\n\n271\n00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.390\nthen walking through at least the basics.\n\n272\n00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.280\n&gt;&gt; Now the other consideration, of course,\n\n273\n00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.130\njust like in any Exchange\nserver that we have to consider\n\n274\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:23.120\nis gonna be troubleshooting\nthe transport services itself.\n\n275\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.690\nSo, Brian, in the coexistence situation,\nare there any thing, is there anything\n\n276\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.580\ndifferent that we need to do, even though\nwe already looked at this in 2016?\n\n277\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.160\n&gt;&gt; Not really, actually.\n\n278\n00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.880\nObviously, like we talked earlier,\nthe same topic in a hybrid,\n\n279\n00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.440\nright, you need to look\noften in two places.\n\n280\n00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.850\nTroubleshooting becomes a little more\ncomplex, but I am gonna show you some of\n\n281\n00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.100\nthe logging components that will\nhelp during this troubleshooting.\n\n282\n00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:53.496\nSo let's go back to mailbox\nserver number one, and\n\n283\n00:16:53.496 --> 00:17:01.663\nwe are gonna start by clearing that\nGet-ReceiveConnector -Server MBX1.\n\n284\n00:17:01.663 --> 00:17:09.690\nWe're gonna\nSelect Name,ProtocolLoggingLevel.\n\n285\n00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.920\nSo this shows all of our\nreceived connectors on MBX1 and\n\n286\n00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.280\nwhat their logging level is.\n\n287\n00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.040\nWe have two set to Verbose,\nthree that are set to None.\n\n288\n00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.910\nIn a troubleshooting scenario, we normally\nlike to turn the logging up all the way.\n\n289\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:28.810\nNot necessarily across the board, but\nonce you've identified maybe the server or\n\n290\n00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.930\nthe connector that's involved,\nyou can set the logging up.\n\n291\n00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:35.190\nIf you're totally at a lost,\nsometimes you can turn it all up and\n\n292\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.880\nthen flip it back down once you're done.\n\n293\n00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.110\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n294\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.144\nWe're gonna do a set-ReceiveConnector.\n\n295\n00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.925\nAnd we are going to specify\n\n296\n00:17:47.925 --> 00:17:54.510\n\"MBX1\\Client Frontend MBX1\" and then we're\n\n297\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:01.500\ngoing to say\n-ProtocolLoggingLevel Verbous.\n\n298\n00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.080\nNow let's rerun the earlier command\njust to make sure that it worked.\n\n299\n00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.690\nAnd now what you're seeing is we have\nflipped up one of the loging levels to\n\n300\n00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:12.780\nVerbose.\n\n301\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.440\nWe could've also flipped them all on.\n\n302\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.980\nBut it just kinda shows you how quick and\n\n303\n00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.530\neasy it is to flip those\nlogging levels up.\n\n304\n00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:20.155\nLet's keep moving.\n\n305\n00:18:25.178 --> 00:18:27.644\nSo I wanna go back to message tracking,\n\n306\n00:18:27.644 --> 00:18:32.803\nbecause this is an important one to help\nyou figure out what servers are involved,\n\n307\n00:18:32.803 --> 00:18:37.110\nwhat the timestamps are, and\nmaybe which logs to look at.\n\n308\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.684\nSo we're gonna go back to Jack.Jackson.\n\n309\n00:18:43.782 --> 00:18:47.522\n.net, say Start,\n\n310\n00:18:47.522 --> 00:18:52.369\nwe're gonna get- Date.\n\n311\n00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:56.481\nA lot of tab completion with that.\n\n312\n00:18:56.481 --> 00:19:03.893\nThere we go, .Addhours, the last 96 hours.\n\n313\n00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.482\nAnd you know what I wanna do?\n\n314\n00:19:05.482 --> 00:19:07.225\nI'm gonna run this and then,\n\n315\n00:19:07.225 --> 00:19:11.920\nI'm gonna do one more after this cuz this\ngonna bring back a ton of information.\n\n316\n00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.810\nAnd we've seen that before.\n\n317\n00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:19.850\nSo let me do an invoke-history, number 23,\nand break it down a little bit better,\n\n318\n00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.050\njust an earlier command I popped\nin there to save us some typing.\n\n319\n00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.940\nSo MessageTracking, I'm just bringing\nback the sender, the message subject,\n\n320\n00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.110\nbut this one of those other log files,\nI know we covered a bit of it earlier,\n\n321\n00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:36.640\nthat helps you kinda troubleshoot and\nit's whether it's coexistence,\n\n322\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.830\nhybrid or just independent Exchange 2016.\n\n323\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:46.410\n&gt;&gt; All right Brian, since we also covered\nthe idea of client access earlier as well,\n\n324\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.340\nwhat about any difference\nin troubleshooting client\n\n325\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.820\naccess in this coexistent\nenvironment as well?\n\n326\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.960\n&gt;&gt; So the main thing is, when we think\nabout coexistence, we're thinking about\n\n327\n00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.740\ndifferent servers, we're thinking\nabout different name spaces,\n\n328\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.052\nand a lot of changes to name spaces.\n\n329\n00:20:02.052 --> 00:20:05.320\nAuto discover, being the first one\nthat we're going to move over.\n\n330\n00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.510\nOne of the best ways to troubleshoot\nthis is go to the client, go to Outlook,\n\n331\n00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.140\nand take a look at the test\nemail auto-configuration.\n\n332\n00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.100\nWe did look at it one time\nbefore a couple of days back,\n\n333\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.510\ndifferent scenario, same test.\n\n334\n00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.541\nLet's go back to that now on client one.\n\n335\n00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.355\nHere we are on client one,\nwe've got Outlook running.\n\n336\n00:20:34.031 --> 00:20:37.660\nAnd we're gonna test\nEmail AutoConfiguration.\n\n337\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.760\nWe might need to zoom in for this.\n\n338\n00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.870\nI'm gonna get that kinda centered up here.\n\n339\n00:20:44.862 --> 00:20:48.890\nSo we are logged on as Tom.Zeller@hugelab.\n\n340\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.551\nWe're gonna uncheck these\ntwo options right here,\n\n341\n00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:58.052\nthe whole guess smart stuff, and as soon\nas we do that we're gonna click Test.\n\n342\n00:21:01.628 --> 00:21:05.227\nAnd I'm gonna go back full screen,\nand at least to see,\n\n343\n00:21:05.227 --> 00:21:08.220\nokay, let's go back to the zoom in here.\n\n344\n00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.530\nSo in a coexistence scenario,\n\n345\n00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.990\nthe very first thing we wanna figure out,\nare all of these URLs.\n\n346\n00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.588\nYou can see them listed down here,\n\n347\n00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:23.150\nbecause in a coexistence scenario\nthere are complication with the URLs.\n\n348\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:29.220\nEspecially if we've started the process\nof introducing 2016 in for auto discover.\n\n349\n00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.840\nAuto discover being the one that,\nif that's broken,\n\n350\n00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.320\nclients are gonna have trouble finding\ntheir mailbox and getting connected.\n\n351\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.680\nSo, this particular test is key.\n\n352\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.292\nI know we've seen it before, but\nI wanted to reiterate it's importance.\n\n353\n00:21:41.292 --> 00:21:43.740\n&gt;&gt; All right Brian,\n\n354\n00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:48.170\nwell that's a lot of things to consider,\nespecially if we are running in this\n\n355\n00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.892\ncoexistence environment with earlier\neditions of Exchanges out there.\n\n356\n00:21:52.892 --> 00:21:57.690\nRemember that in this episode we did\ntalk a little bit about this idea\n\n357\n00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:02.510\nof making sure that we take care of\nthe name spaces in coexistence, so\n\n358\n00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.160\nwe have to make sure that\neverything is actually right there.\n\n359\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.420\nAlso Brian took us through planning for,\n\n360\n00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.930\nof course, a proxy redirection\nwhen we needed to, as well as\n\n361\n00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:17.020\nfirewall types of information for\nthat coexistence, and even mail flow.\n\n362\n00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.850\nAnd lastly, we took a look,\nof course, about the mailbox\n\n363\n00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.260\nmigrations themselves,\nalong with the transport and\n\n364\n00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.560\nthe client access considerations that\nare also there in trouble-shooting\n\n365\n00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.860\nwhen we actually have two different\nversions of Microsoft Exchange running.\n\n366\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.210\nBrian, this sounds a little bit more\nchallenging in terms of getting\n\n367\n00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.350\na lab set up to make sure\nthat we practice this.\n\n368\n00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:46.860\nAny hints that you can give\nus as we get ready for\n\n369\n00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.550\nthe exam, because it does sound a little\nbit more challenging now that you're\n\n370\n00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.930\nadding in another version of\nMicrosoft Exchange in there?\n\n371\n00:22:54.970 --> 00:23:00.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\noccasionally Microsoft offers an online\n\n372\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.140\nvirtual lab where there is a coexistence\nscenario already built out for\n\n373\n00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.960\nyou and kind of shows you the process of\ngoing through the upgrade, the migration.\n\n374\n00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.420\nThose aren't always available,\nbut when they are,\n\n375\n00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.770\nthey're definitely worth checking out\nbecause, again, setting this all up from\n\n376\n00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:20.840\nthe ground up just to cover a couple\ntopics on the exam may not be worth it.\n\n377\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.620\n&gt;&gt; All right Brian, well thank you again\nfor helping us out in this particular\n\n378\n00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.290\nsituation when we do\ntalk about coexistence.\n\n379\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:33.680\nAnd thank you also for watching us as we\ncontinue on through Microsoft Exchange.\n\n380\n00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.050\nBut there are more shows to come,\nbut for this show, we're ending.\n\n381\n00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:41.320\nAnd so signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n382\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Brian Svidergol.\n\n383\n00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.288\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Microsoft Exchange 2016 shows.\n\n384\n00:23:46.288 --> 00:23:53.897\n[MUSIC]\n\n385\n00:23:53.897 -->

They describe and distinguished different migration paths depending on the scenario.  Also, the guys take a look at migrating mailboxes, migrating to modern public folders.  Brian also helps us to consider planning for features found in earlier versions of Exchange that are de-emphasized or discontinued in Exchange 2016.  With his experience, Brian brings up considerations for transitioning and decommissioning servers before final steps of getting rid of earlier Exchange servers and takes a look at troubleshooting the Mailbox Replication Services.",
