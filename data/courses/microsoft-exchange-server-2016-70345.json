70-345.\n\n3\n00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.870\nYou want to make sure that you're\nactually ready to take the exam, so\n\n4\n00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.520\nwe're actually have an entire\nshow based on that.\n\n5\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.130\nBefore we get started let's talk\na little bit about getting ready for\n\n6\n00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.590\nthat exam as well.\n\n7\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.690\nOnce you're fully prepared, make sure that\nyou go to your Pearson Vue testing center,\n\n8\n00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.550\nand get registered,\nyou can do that online as well.\n\n9\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.230\nBut wherever you are in the world,\n\n10\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.520\nmake sure you also know that\nyou're gonna have to pay a fee for\n\n11\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.290\nthe exam as well, currently, right now\nin the United States, it's about $165.\n\n12\n00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.480\nMake sure you check your local rates, and\n\n13\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.030\nyou actually find out what\nthe price is going to be.\n\n14\n00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.990\nOnce you're registered, you'll go\nthere on the day of the exam, sit for\n\n15\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.790\nthe exam and then, of course hopefully,\npass the exam as well.\n\n16\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.070\nBut to ensure that you are ready and\nprepared for that, in our show we're gonna\n\n17\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.760\nhave Mr. Brian as being our subject\nmatter expert to help us out.\n\n18\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.570\nSo Brian, what are we gonna\nbe covering during our show?\n\n19\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.500\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Ronnie, so we've actually got,\nthis exam has six primary topics, and\n\n20\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.550\neach of the six topics represents\nabout 15 or 20% of the exam.\n\n21\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.830\nSo, the bad news is,\nyou can't focus on one topic because\n\n22\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.600\nthey're all evenly spread throughout,\nyou're gonna need to know a little bit\n\n23\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.532\nabout all these things to get ready for\nthe exam.\n\n24\n00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:23.100\nWhile we walk you through some of\nthe topics, we're gonna start at the top,\n\n25\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.310\nthe first one is plan deploy, manage,\nand troubleshoot mailbox databases.\n\n26\n00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.060\nSo this is all about the database side,\n\n27\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.660\nit starts off with a lot\nof sizing components.\n\n28\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.590\nHow many databases do you need,\nhow much storage do you need?\n\n29\n00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.050\nSo one of things you want to focus on,\nis how to size an environment if you're\n\n30\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.486\ngiven a certain set of circumstances, like\nmaybe you have a couple of thousand users,\n\n31\n00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:51.290\nthey each have a two gig mailbox,\nthey send 100 messages a day.\n\n32\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.370\nThe tool that you want to take a look at,\nmake sure you're familiar with,\n\n33\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.130\nis Exchange Server sizing calculator.\n\n34\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.850\nThat's that spreadsheet that will help\nyou calculate out the environment,\n\n35\n00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.510\nthe storage,\n\n36\n00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.750\neven the bandwidth if you decide to\ngo with database availability groups.\n\n37\n00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.450\nSo on the database side, there's a ton\nof topics, you're also gonna dive into\n\n38\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.970\ncreating databases, managing databases,\nmounting and dismounting,\n\n39\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.900\nmaybe get into a little bit of that\nstuff too, so that's topic number one.\n\n40\n00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.090\nFor topic number two plan, deploy, manage,\nand troubleshoot Client Access services.\n\n41\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.510\nSo, what we're talking about here is\nthe client population like your end users,\n\n42\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.970\nand how they get to all the services\nthat exchange has to offer.\n\n43\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.750\nSo, we're talking about everything\nfrom Outlook connectivity,\n\n44\n00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.960\nto Outlook on the web, to mobile devices,\n\n45\n00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.910\nanyway that anybody can get in and\nconsume the Exchange Services.\n\n46\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.460\nThere's a whole bunch of\ntopics to cover down here,\n\n47\n00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.760\nI wanna point out a couple of them.\n\n48\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.200\nWe have a little bit on authentication,\nknowing about form-based authentication,\n\n49\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.130\nkerberos based authentication, how to set\nthat stuff, we get into client namespaces,\n\n50\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.990\nall the names that people use,\nand have to remember.\n\n51\n00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.460\nYou think about mail.yourdomain.com, can\nyou use that across the whole environment,\n\n52\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.360\nwhere do you set that stuff up, and\ndoes it need to be different internally,\n\n53\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.450\nexternally?\n\n54\n00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.013\nAll right,\n\n55\n00:03:20.013 --> 00:03:24.130\na lot of planning considerations\naround the Client Access pieces.\n\n56\n00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.900\nAnd then also in there, we talk about\nsome of the networking pieces, too,\n\n57\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.510\nlike load balancing, and\n\n58\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.170\neven some site resiliency when it comes\nto getting the clients connected.\n\n59\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.778\nSo that's high level topic number two.\n\n60\n00:03:40.778 --> 00:03:45.125\nThe third one is the exchange,\ninfrastructure, recipients and\n\n61\n00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:49.330\nsecurity, planning,\ndeploying, and managing.\n\n62\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.825\nWhat you'll find in there is a lot\nof stuff on Active Directory,\n\n63\n00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:55.960\npreparing Active Directory\nto have exchange.\n\n64\n00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.740\nWe're talking about schema updates,\ndomain preparation, and\n\n65\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.115\nthe other pieces are around security,\nmail unable to object permissions.\n\n66\n00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:09.800\nThese is a very tough area,\n\n67\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.650\nall the permission stuff, we have\na lot of role based access control, so\n\n68\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.580\na couple of things I wanna point out here,\nhow do we give our administrators\n\n69\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.480\naccess to the environment,\nwithout giving them more than they need?\n\n70\n00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.110\nSo it's all about the principle\nof least privilege right?\n\n71\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.270\nYour gonna need to know\nthe built in roles,\n\n72\n00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.850\nyour gonna need to know\nhow to customize them.\n\n73\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.060\nOn the permission side, we're gonna dive\ninto anything from mailbox permissions,\n\n74\n00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.220\nto public folder permission.\n\n75\n00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.590\nHow do you give other people\naccess to somebody's mailbox?\n\n76\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.410\nThink about shared mailboxes, and\n\n77\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.410\nwhat if you just wanted to\ngive them access to a folder?\n\n78\n00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.689\nYou've got a lot of granularity there, and\n\n79\n00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.902\nthese are the details you're\ngonna need to know for the exam.\n\n80\n00:04:49.902 --> 00:04:52.110\nAll right,\nlet's talk about the next topic.\n\n81\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.270\nPlan, deploy, manage compliance,\narchiving, eDiscovery, and auditing.\n\n82\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.950\nSo this is an interesting one,\n\n83\n00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.600\nvery closely related to security,\nthere is a turnout detail here.\n\n84\n00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.150\nWhen we talk about compliance and\narchiving,\n\n85\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.907\nwhat we are talking about is, do we need\nto maintain data at the organisation, and\n\n86\n00:05:14.907 --> 00:05:18.720\nif so how long, and\nif we do, how do we do that?\n\n87\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.800\nWe can go with archiving as one example,\nwhen we thing of archiving,\n\n88\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.920\nthat's taking your mail data,\nand keeping it for the long term.\n\n89\n00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.350\nThere's a lot of choices and planning\nconsiderations, for example, do you wanna\n\n90\n00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.130\nkeep that archiving data on premises,\nor do you wanna move it up to the Cloud,\n\n91\n00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.280\nwhat are the different things\nyou need to think about there?\n\n92\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.630\nWhen we talk about eDiscovery, we're\ntalking about the ability for the security\n\n93\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.890\nteam to take a look at all of the mail\ndata throughout the whole environment,\n\n94\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.640\nlooking for something maybe to do with\na legal case or something similar.\n\n95\n00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.435\nFor the exam, you're gonna need to know\nhow to set up eDiscovery, how to run\n\n96\n00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:58.730\neDiscovery, and what permissions at\nyou're gonna need in order to do that.\n\n97\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.170\nAnd then finally, auditing for\nthis particular topic.\n\n98\n00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.270\nAuditing is capturing all of\nthe actions that were performed\n\n99\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.580\ntypically by an administrator\nwhile they're doing their job.\n\n100\n00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.833\nWhich commandlets did they run,\nwhich parameters, who ran it,\n\n101\n00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:15.940\nwhat did they run, what did they change?\n\n102\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.920\nYou're gonna need that stuff\nwhen you wanna go back and\n\n103\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.185\nfigure out what caused maybe an outage or\nsome kind of bad configuration change.\n\n104\n00:06:23.185 --> 00:06:25.435\nIn addition to\nthe administrative side though,\n\n105\n00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:29.095\nyou can also do auditing on\nthe mailboxes themselves.\n\n106\n00:06:29.095 --> 00:06:31.435\nSo if you're ever in a trouble shooting\nsituation and you wanna figure out,\n\n107\n00:06:31.435 --> 00:06:35.745\nwhat's going on with the user's mailbox,\nyou can turn on auditing on the mailbox\n\n108\n00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:39.895\nfor specific actions, whether they're\ncreates, or deletes, or removes, and\n\n109\n00:06:39.895 --> 00:06:42.685\nin troubleshooting scenarios,\nyou can dig that data up.\n\n110\n00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:45.810\nSo you're definitely gonna\nneed to know about that.\n\n111\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.180\nAnd then our final topic is implement and\nmanage coexistence,\n\n112\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.460\nhybrid scenarios,\nmigration, and federation.\n\n113\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.000\nThis is a whole flurry of topics,\nand their big ones too.\n\n114\n00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000\nThis is where we'll get into\na little bit of Office 365,\n\n115\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.810\nwhen you think about taking your\non premises environment, and\n\n116\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.020\nconfiguring it to be a hybrid\nenvironment with Office 365.\n\n117\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.110\nMaybe you're gonna have some mailboxes\non-premises, maybe you're gonna have some\n\n118\n00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.471\nin the Cloud, maybe you're gonna\nmove everything into the Cloud, but\n\n119\n00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.712\nyou're gonna need that\nco-existence time for\n\n120\n00:07:20.712 --> 00:07:22.866\na little while where you\nhave to manage both.\n\n121\n00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:26.560\nYou're gonna need to know the details\naround that set-up process,\n\n122\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.553\nwhat are the requirement,\nhow do users authenticate,\n\n123\n00:07:29.553 --> 00:07:32.620\ndo we need to do any sinking\nup to Azure Active Directory?\n\n124\n00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.630\nBeyond that we get into migration and\ncoexistence from earlier version,\n\n125\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:45.609\nso think about Exchange 2010 or 2013, you\nwanna bring 2016 into your environment,\n\n126\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.350\nhow do you do that, what are you gonna\nneed to know, what do you do once it's in?\n\n127\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.140\nAnd then how do you get\nrid of the old stuff, so\n\n128\n00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.570\nthere's a bunch of topics around that.\n\n129\n00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.580\nEverything from moving mailboxes\nwhether individually or\n\n130\n00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.340\nin batches, moving the public folders.\n\n131\n00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.000\nAnd then the last little piece you\nneed to move before you can start\n\n132\n00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.080\nthe decommissioning process, and\nthere's a lot of details even\n\n133\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.510\naround the decommissioning process, and\nI think that are covered here on the exam.\n\n134\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:19.130\nSo, that's quite a bit of stuff here,\nI do have one more that I left off,\n\n135\n00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.740\nand that's the plan, deploy, manage and\ntroubleshoot transport services.\n\n136\n00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.540\nSo, transport services\nare the backend services that\n\n137\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.850\nhandle the flow of email data, when you\nsend an email from one person to another,\n\n138\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.330\nwhether it's inside the company,\nor maybe out to the internet.\n\n139\n00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.710\nThere's a whole transport pipeline\narchitecture, some of which is new to\n\n140\n00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.250\nExchange 2016, that you're gonna\nneed to know the details about.\n\n141\n00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.660\nYou wanna really know, how does\nan email get from one place to another,\n\n142\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.730\nhow does it choose which route to go down,\nwhat are the infrastructure\n\n143\n00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.750\nconsiderations to change that routing,\nmaybe enhance a little bit?\n\n144\n00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.820\nWe're gonna dive into\nthose details in the show,\n\n145\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.390\nso that you're comfortable as you\nget those topics on your exam.\n\n146\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:09.760\nSo, that is a breakdown of high level of\neverything we want to cover on this show.\n\n147\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.900\nWe're gonna dive into when we talk\nacross the topic a lot of PowerShell.\n\n148\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.470\nSo, most everything today, from an\nadministrative prospective, you can do it\n\n149\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.260\nfrom the GUI components, like Exchange\nadmin center or from PowerShell.\n\n150\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.960\nFor exam preparation,\nI like to focus on the PowerShell pieces,\n\n151\n00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.350\nbecause those are the most testable.\n\n152\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.680\nSo, you'll see, we're gonna cover\na lot of the command line, but\n\n153\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.500\nwhen it's appropriate,\nwe're also gonna go into the Gooey,\n\n154\n00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.510\nbecause sometimes it shows you\na good end user experience and\n\n155\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.560\nwhat the impacts and\neffects of some of these changes are.\n\n156\n00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.580\nSo, be prepared for a lot of PowerShell,\nand let's get ready.\n\n157\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:53.790\nIf you think that you're gonna be\ntaking the exam 70-345, then we have\n\n158\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.596\nall this information coming\nup in the show, stay tuned.\n\n159\n00:09:58.596 --> 00:10:01.459\n[SOUND]\n\n",
