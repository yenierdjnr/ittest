ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,080\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,030\nHows it going Nathan?\n\n6\n00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,114\nPretty good Ronnie how are you today?\n\n7\n00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:46,360\nAll right ready for\nanother exciting episode into the world of\n\n8\n00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,095\nvirtualization today is\nwhere we're heading.\n\n9\n00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:48,940\nMm-hm.\n\n10\n00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,759\nYeah.\nYeah virtualization.\n\n11\n00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,660\nVirtualization stuff today.\n\n12\n00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,615\nWe will be focusing on Hyper-V.\n\n13\n00:00:55,615 --> 00:01:00,640\nHyper-V is what we'll be using to\nbuild our virtual machines and\n\n14\n00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,030\nall that stuff off of.\n\n15\n00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,250\nBut before we get into that let's talk\na bit about virtualization and just\n\n16\n00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,630\nkind of what it is and why we would want\nto virtualize some of our workstations.\n\n17\n00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,330\nYeah, now a lot of times when we start\ntalking about the idea of virtualization,\n\n18\n00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,760\nif you haven't heard about this term,\n\n19\n00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,970\nagain, this is where we can actually fully\nuse the hardware of the computer, right.\n\n20\n00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,260\nThe majority of the time when\nwe're actually using computer,\n\n21\n00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,150\nwe're running an operating system and\nsome applications, and\n\n22\n00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,780\ndoing a few functions, but we're really\nnot taking advantage of the high powered\n\n23\n00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,110\nperformance parts that we do have\ninside of our particular machines here.\n\n24\n00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,990\nVirtualization gives us\nthe benefit to be able to do that.\n\n25\n00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,740\nAnd the exciting benefit of doing this\nof course is actually being able to run\n\n26\n00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,080\nmultiple operating systems\nsimultaneously as what we have okay.\n\n27\n00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,910\nYep, so Ronnie so I've got a got\na statistic that I got from Don Pezet\n\n28\n00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,190\na while ago and\nI don't know what his reference is,\n\n29\n00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:03,280\nso once he said that 80% of the people\nus just 20% of their computer resources.\n\n30\n00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,250\nSo while we've got some of these high\npower work stations with a ton of\n\n31\n00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,100\nRAM you know we've got all this hard\ndrive space crammed in there and\n\n32\n00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,690\nwe use it for\nlooking- Browsing the internet.\n\n33\n00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,680\nYeah, looking at funny cat pictures and\nwriting email.\n\n34\n00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,210\nThat's right.\n\n35\n00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,760\nRight, so\nthere is a lot of system performance,\n\n36\n00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,590\nsome of our utilization\nthat just goes unused.\n\n37\n00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,250\nAnd so leveraging virtualization,\nwe can run multiple\n\n38\n00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,720\ninstances of a PC on top of our hardware\nand really get the most out of it.\n\n39\n00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,600\nNow, we've been able to do this but\nonly one operating system at a time.\n\n40\n00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,020\nFor example you've heard about the idea\nof dual-booting a computer, right?\n\n41\n00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,520\nThis is where you actually\nrun two operating systems.\n\n42\n00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,540\nBut you boot into one, you use that, and\n\n43\n00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,470\ndo everything that you need to with that\nand the application that you need, and\n\n44\n00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,770\nthen you can shut that machine down,\nreboot into the other operating system.\n\n45\n00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,180\nIn terms of virtualization, we're talking\nabout running two separate operating\n\n46\n00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,330\nsystems at least simultaneously\non the same set of hardware.\n\n47\n00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,220\nSo that actually is kind\nof a neat technique for us,\n\n48\n00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,580\nto be able to take advantage of all of the\nactual performance improvements that we've\n\n49\n00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,044\ngotten from hardware over the years.\n\n50\n00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:11,700\nSo Ronnie,\n\n51\n00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,732\nlet me, as far as virtualization, let me\nalso toss this one out at you, all right.\n\n52\n00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:20,790\nSo let's think about, in a,\nwe've got a server closet.\n\n53\n00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,660\nAnd inside our server closet,\nwe've got a bunch of servers in there.\n\n54\n00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,091\nAnd these servers,\nthey do just one task, right?\n\n55\n00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,881\nSo we've got an email server,\nwe gotta file server,\n\n56\n00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:32,360\nwe've got our domain controller, right?\n\n57\n00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,070\nIt's our own little, little server.\n\n58\n00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,990\nSo let's say that you are a sys\nadmin at some place, and so\n\n59\n00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:45,240\nyour manager comes to you and says hey,\nwe need to bring up an Asterisk server.\n\n60\n00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,990\nLet's say we're gonna roll out\na Voice over IP or something.\n\n61\n00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,600\nSo we need to bring up an Asterisk server.\n\n62\n00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,290\nSo now you've got to go and\nspec out what hardware you need.\n\n63\n00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,660\nYou have to get your server ordered,\nit has to be built and shipped out.\n\n64\n00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,660\nOf course, intercepted and\nthen stuff loaded onto it.\n\n65\n00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,635\nThen it will be repackaged [LAUGH] And\nthen.\n\n66\n00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:04,229\nShipped out to you.\n\n67\n00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:06,310\nYes.\nAnd then shipped out to you from there.\n\n68\n00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,940\nAnd then you have to get the server,\nyou have to put it in your server rack,\n\n69\n00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,120\nyou have to make sure you have UPS- Power.\n\n70\n00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120\nPower for it.\n\n71\n00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,120\nAnd load up all your software,\nthen configure it and this takes a while.\n\n72\n00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,900\nIt does.\nSo maybe,\n\n73\n00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,100\nI don't know, at least a few weeks.\n\n74\n00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,860\nCould take a few days to a few\nweeks to get everything done,\n\n75\n00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860\nin terms of the ordering and\neverything else.\n\n76\n00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,340\nYou are correct.\n\n77\n00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,069\nNow if we contrast that to let's say\nwe're now running on virtualization.\n\n78\n00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,170\nSo then your manager comes to you and\nsays, hey,\n\n79\n00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,696\nwe need an Asterisk server brought up,\nso what can you do?\n\n80\n00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:45,469\nWell, you can go and slice off a piece of\nyour system hardware, spin up a virtual\n\n81\n00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:50,172\nmachine, you can start configuring it\nbefore you go to lunch and get it brought\n\n82\n00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:55,330\nup within that day or within a couple\nof days after configuring everything.\n\n83\n00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,680\nSo virtualizing our stuff I made it,\nI mean, fantastic.\n\n84\n00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,250\nRight.\n\n85\n00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,130\nThe main benefit again is taking advantage\nof the hardware that we already have in\n\n86\n00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,810\nexistence here, so not maybe even\nagain like what Nate mentioned,\n\n87\n00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,900\nwe might not have to\nactually buy new hardware.\n\n88\n00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,720\nWhat we can actually do is utilize the\nhardware that we have a little bit better,\n\n89\n00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,140\nthe term is what we call optimization,\nright?\n\n90\n00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,560\nOptimizing the use of\nthe hardware before us.\n\n91\n00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,330\nSo when we start talking about\nthat idea of virtualization here,\n\n92\n00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,340\nwhat are we really actually\ndoing with the actual\n\n93\n00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,930\nhardware is what we're really\ntalking about here, okay.\n\n94\n00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,140\nSo normally for what we set, right.\n\n95\n00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,140\nWe load on an operating system,\nwe load on applications.\n\n96\n00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,740\nAnd that takes advantage of all\nthe hardware in front of it.\n\n97\n00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,330\nBut there are times, though, that we need\nis actually to be able to run, up front,\n\n98\n00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,760\nseveral operating systems exactly at\nthe same time on that same hardware.\n\n99\n00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,240\nVirtualization is what helps us do that.\n\n100\n00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,535\nAnd there's actually a couple of\ndifferent ways that we can do that.\n\n101\n00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:47,990\nMm-hm.\n\n102\n00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,340\nYep.\nYep, couple of different ways.\n\n103\n00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,360\nWhat do mean?\n\n104\n00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,440\nWhat ways?\n\n105\n00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,250\nYeah, well, for us here, when we talk\nabout the idea of virtualization if kind\n\n106\n00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,515\nof falls down into two bigger categories\nof what we can actually do, right?\n\n107\n00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:02,201\nThe idea of what we call type-1 and\n\n108\n00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:05,105\ntype-2 hypervisors is what\nwe're talking about, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:09,855\nNow the idea of the hypervisor for\nus is a virtual machine manager, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:13,250\nWhat it does is monitor, or\nwhatever you want to call it here.\n\n111\n00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,020\nIt again, allows us to be able to\nemulate the hardware basically and\n\n112\n00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,330\nthen lie to the operating systems that\nwant to give if a software environment\n\n113\n00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,920\nthat actually emulates the hardware is\nwhat we're really taking a look at here.\n\n114\n00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,995\nYeah, so the type-1 and the type-2.\n\n115\n00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:33,290\nDo we want to get into slight specific\nones and how they differ from each other?\n\n116\n00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,352\nWell, let's try and\ngive them a little bit of a visual here.\n\n117\n00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:40,500\nSo over on my picker machine\nas we take a look here.\n\n118\n00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,010\nYou'll see I made a little diagram for\nus and hopefully\n\n119\n00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,110\neverything will actually work exactly\nthe way I planned it to work out here.\n\n120\n00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,888\nSo the way I was describing\na traditional PC,\n\n121\n00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:55,471\nin terms of what we call\na non-virtualized environment,\n\n122\n00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:59,508\nhere is the hardware that we would have,\nso whatever it might be.\n\n123\n00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:02,542\nAgain, our CPU, our RAM, our hard drive,\n\n124\n00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:05,911\nmotherboard exactly what we have here,\nright?\n\n125\n00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:08,682\nWe then go out, and\nwe purchase an operating system, and\n\n126\n00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:12,050\nwe install that on to the hardware\nat this point, makes it bootable.\n\n127\n00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,780\nAllow us to go to work with\nthat hardware as well.\n\n128\n00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,630\nAnd then we start purchasing\nindividual applications.\n\n129\n00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,670\nSo there is Nate's Steam client,\nwhatever he wants here.\n\n130\n00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,190\nAnd then maybe he actually has an email\nprogram, whatever else he does here,\n\n131\n00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,370\nand of course maybe\neven some other things.\n\n132\n00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,650\nSo I just labeled these\njust generically for\n\n133\n00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,130\nfour different applications\nthat we would run, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,730\nSo at this point, as we're running these,\n\n135\n00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,140\nit is taking advantage of\nthe hardware that we have, but\n\n136\n00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,890\nit could be that we're really not taking\nthe full advantage of the hardware.\n\n137\n00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,990\nSo we're using maybe 20% of everything\nthat we actually have installed on here\n\n138\n00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,130\nin terms of hardware, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,710\nAnd most of us have been doing that.\n\n140\n00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,450\nAnd that's pretty much what we have.\n\n141\n00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,764\nBut if you're working in an environment\nin which you actually need to take\n\n142\n00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:56,321\nadvantage of this hardware more.\n\n143\n00:07:56,321 --> 00:08:00,532\nBecause bringing up new computers can\nbe expensive and everything else here,\n\n144\n00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:03,273\nwe may want to look at this\nidea of virtualization,\n\n145\n00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:05,017\nis what we want to take a look at.\n\n146\n00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:09,705\nAnd so for us here, there's many products\nout there And the main one that we can\n\n147\n00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:14,606\nactually start out with, which is a little\nbit strange here, but it's the idea of\n\n148\n00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:19,320\nactually doing what we call a choosing,\nwhat's called a Type II Hypervisor.\n\n149\n00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,610\nNow, this actually does\nrun fairly similar to\n\n150\n00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,720\nthe way that the non-virtualized\nenvironment does.\n\n151\n00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,985\nAnd let me show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n152\n00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:32,420\nAt the base of it,\nis essentially the same concept.\n\n153\n00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,550\nSo you'll notice it's pretty much the same\nas the non-virtualized idea here.\n\n154\n00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,670\nYou're running your basic hardware.\n\n155\n00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,790\nYou're running your operating system and\neven a few applications on it.\n\n156\n00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,250\nBut then, you can go out and actually\ndownload, well some of these is what we\n\n157\n00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,470\ncall the idea of a virtual PC client,\nor a management system.\n\n158\n00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,290\nIf you've heard of things like,\nOracle Virtual Box or\n\n159\n00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,170\nMicrosoft Virtual PC, these are things\nthat we can actually put on in\n\n160\n00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,220\naddition to the current\noperating system that's running.\n\n161\n00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,430\nAnd that allows us now, to have this\nunit here, which is that hypervisor.\n\n162\n00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,420\nThis takes the hardware and essentially\ntranslates it into software giving\n\n163\n00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,010\nus essentially a fake environment or\na virtualized environment is what it does.\n\n164\n00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,770\nAnd now, when I run that I can\nspec out an actual machine.\n\n165\n00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,690\nI can tell it how big I want\nthe hard drive to be, how,\n\n166\n00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,920\nRAM I was trying to think of the word, how\nmuch RAM I want to give to it, as well.\n\n167\n00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,210\nAnd then, I can install an operating\nsystem in that environment, and\n\n168\n00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,440\ninside that operating system,\n\n169\n00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,910\nI can also run, well, another\nmachine directly on top of it here.\n\n170\n00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,620\nOkay?\n\n171\n00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,990\nNow we do actually have to make room\nbecause we're still running a regular PC\n\n172\n00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,910\nhere with the actual operating system and\nall the applications, as well as, running\n\n173\n00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,360\nthis hypervisor so they have to share\nthe common resources between them, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,800\nSo that's usually the first level\nthat most people end up trying here\n\n175\n00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,710\nwhen we start taking that\nidea of virtualization.\n\n176\n00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,420\nAs you can go out and\n\n177\n00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,200\nfind these products anywhere if you\njust do a regular Google search.\n\n178\n00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,110\nYou can find them,\ninstall them right on and\n\n179\n00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,220\nit works just like another application.\n\n180\n00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,490\nWhen you do that, you can be\nrunning your base operating system,\n\n181\n00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,880\nrunning this particular virtual\nmachine manager for us.\n\n182\n00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,400\nAnd then actually running\nan operating system inside a window,\n\n183\n00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,890\nif you're running Windows.\n\n184\n00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,470\nSo you're running simultaneous\noperating systems is what you're doing.\n\n185\n00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,710\nYeah, and\nwith the ype II hypervisor there it's\n\n186\n00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,620\nyou can think of it as\nkind of like an emulator.\n\n187\n00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:40,780\nSo, if you ever fired up any SENS ROMs or\nany Genesis roms, they run as an emulator.\n\n188\n00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,920\nAnd so basically, yeah a type two.\n\n189\n00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,060\nThat's kind of what it is.\n\n190\n00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,920\nIt emulates hardware, the OS and\n\n191\n00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,230\nthen uses,and so the operating system\nthat it sits on top of the hardware.\n\n192\n00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,080\nSo now for the guest OS.\n\n193\n00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,430\nSo the VMs that are running.\n\n194\n00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,120\nWhen those VMs need to access memory or\nhard disk or something of that sort,\n\n195\n00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,474\nthen it contacts the hypervisor and\ngets it's virtual hardware,\n\n196\n00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:12,980\nthen the hypervisor then talks to the OS.\n\n197\n00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,100\nHey, I need to access the hard drive for\nsomething.\n\n198\n00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,750\nAnd then the OS then lets it get down\nto the hardware and make that call.\n\n199\n00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,690\nSo, the OS, it sits in the middle, so\nit's kind of the gatekeeper between\n\n200\n00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,060\nthe virtual hardware that\nsits in the hypervisor, and\n\n201\n00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,309\nthen the real hardware,\nthat is the bare metal.\n\n202\n00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,370\nNow the other type of hypervisor that\nwe have is the type I hypervisor.\n\n203\n00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,050\nNow this one runs a bit different.\n\n204\n00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,170\nNow the hypervisor it sits\ndirectly on top of the hardware,\n\n205\n00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,810\nso it sits underneath\nthe operating system.\n\n206\n00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,830\nAnd what this does is it generally\njust exposes the hardware directly\n\n207\n00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,850\nto those guests OS's right,\nor those virtual machines.\n\n208\n00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:04,390\nAnd so performance, performance it's\nnear identical to a bare metal install.\n\n209\n00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,460\nNow I mean there's, some things can be a\ncontention and other things of that sort.\n\n210\n00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,020\nAnd kind of get in the way and\nslow it down a little bit.\n\n211\n00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,730\nBut this is gonna be what\nwe'll use in a production or\n\n212\n00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,230\njust to get the most speed and\npower out of our virtual machines.\n\n213\n00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,770\nAnd a lot of times it's not\na production environment,\n\n214\n00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,240\nsuch as a business environment.\n\n215\n00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,670\nThis is the type of\nhypervisor that you'll see\n\n216\n00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,190\nused more often as this\ntype one hypervisor.\n\n217\n00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,750\nIn which we just buy our\nparticular servers that we need.\n\n218\n00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,200\nWe install the actual\nbare metal hypervisor or\n\n219\n00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,810\nthe virtual machine manager that we want.\n\n220\n00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,660\nWe're gonna be focusing in on Hyper V for\nus, is what we're gonna do.\n\n221\n00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,980\nAnd then from that point, we can go\nahead and allow that hypervisor, again,\n\n222\n00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,260\nto now be able to create multiple\nvirtual machines on top of it.\n\n223\n00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,410\nAnd with the server hardware,\nwe can actually create well, a lot times,\n\n224\n00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,320\ndepending as much hardware as you actually\nhave in terms of RAM and hard drive space,\n\n225\n00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,360\nyou can create just about as many you want\njust about here, is what we want here.\n\n226\n00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,080\nSo usually inside of an environment, these\nare kind of the options that we have.\n\n227\n00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,770\nEither a Type I or a Type II hypervisor.\n\n228\n00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,700\nSo, for us, in terms of virtualization\nthose are pretty much the two different\n\n229\n00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,270\nbasic types that we have.\n\n230\n00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:25,810\nSo with the type one the hypervisor,\nit acts as the traffic cop more or less.\n\n231\n00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,510\nYou know making the calls back and\nforth as opposed to the OS.\n\n232\n00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,080\nGood way to go.\n\n233\n00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,470\nNow with type ones we have things like\nVMware., Citrix makes them, Hyper-V which\n\n234\n00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,830\nis what we will be focusing on today,\nare examples of type one hypervisors.\n\n235\n00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,590\nWe just want to make sure we clarify\nwhat the different types were and so\n\n236\n00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,340\nthat's where we're at.\n\n237\n00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,260\nSo you're going to be taking a look at\nessentially right there when we do so.\n\n238\n00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:56,710\nSo when we take a look at this\nidea of the virtualization, right.\n\n239\n00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,270\nFor us here, this is actually going to\nbe where you're going to see more often\n\n240\n00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,210\nin the business environment today.\n\n241\n00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,290\nSo no longer are the days where we just\ninstall a single operating system and\n\n242\n00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,660\nsay hey, we're just going\nto turn on just a server or\n\n243\n00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,810\njust a file server a lot of times.\n\n244\n00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,710\nIt may be we're actually running multiple\nserver roles on that one machine, but\n\n245\n00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,660\nif you actually needed to you can actually\nuse this hypervisor to separate that out\n\n246\n00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,300\nand actually have them act as their\nindependent machines directly on this same\n\n247\n00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,530\nhardware optimizing the usage again,\nis what we have.\n\n248\n00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:35,810\nSo let's take a, so now we've got\nan idea of what it is and some examples\n\n249\n00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,760\non why we would want to use it, and how\nwe can get the most out of our hardware.\n\n250\n00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,530\nNow let's talk about the hardware that\nwe need to leverage this kind of stuff.\n\n251\n00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,230\nSome of our requirements.\n\n252\n00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,550\nWhen it comes down to it,\nremember just like anything else right.\n\n253\n00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,180\nWe're gonna need some basic, minimum\nhardware requirements that we have.\n\n254\n00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,800\nSo depending on what system you use,\n\n255\n00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,260\nyou again want to take\na look at those as well.\n\n256\n00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,800\nSince we're really focusing\nin on the idea of Hyper-V, or\n\n257\n00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,440\nMicrosoft Hyper-V, or\nWindows Server Hyper-V here,\n\n258\n00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,180\nwe really wanna take a look at those\nparticular minimum system requirements.\n\n259\n00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,210\nNow the nice thing about the idea of\nrunning Windows Server, the Hyper-V\n\n260\n00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:22,080\n2012 R2 edition, is that it really doesn't\nrequire a lot more than the minimum that\n\n261\n00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,350\nit requires to install on just a regular\nWindows Server Edition, is what we have.\n\n262\n00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,902\nSo when it comes down to it on\nthe basic hardware here for us.\n\n263\n00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:35,115\nLet me see if I can actually bring\nup a notepad file for us here.\n\n264\n00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:37,710\nOops, we got another show note.\n\n265\n00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,000\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,543\nSo, for us here, on the minimum,\n\n267\n00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:51,922\nif I can spell minimum,\n[LAUGH] hardware requirements.\n\n268\n00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:57,097\nThat's pretty much the same\n\n269\n00:15:57,097 --> 00:16:02,489\nas installing Windows server\n\n270\n00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:07,670\n2012 R2, we have R2.\n\n271\n00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,926\nI can't spell.\n\n272\n00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,782\nAll right, now what are those\nparticular basic requirements?\n\n273\n00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:18,071\nFor us on the CPU, the minimum here\nis not saying what you want to do but\n\n274\n00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:22,438\nyou need at least a 1.4\ngigahert processor.\n\n275\n00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:26,400\nYou're never gonna do this with just\na minimum of your actually running\n\n276\n00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,300\nthe idea of virtualization, but that's\nkind of mims if you're doing this for\n\n277\n00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,460\nhyper v is that idea.\n\n278\n00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,960\nI'm not liking the way it's looking there.\n\n279\n00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,870\nOkay?\n\n280\n00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,420\nNow in terms of hard drive space,\n\n281\n00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,480\nonce again,\nyou're not gonna actually want to do this.\n\n282\n00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,940\nIt's going to be about, I think 30 gigs,\nis what I actually had written down there.\n\n283\n00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,440\nGigabyte hard drive.\n\n284\n00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,120\nOkay?\n\n285\n00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,930\nAnd in terms of RAM again, it's not a lot.\n\n286\n00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,070\nRemember this is the minimum\nrequirement to just install it.\n\n287\n00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,430\nIt doesn't mean it's gonna run that well.\n\n288\n00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,340\nIts going to be 512 megabytes of RAM.\n\n289\n00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,140\nNow, you and I, we would never think\nabout actually running virtualization\n\n290\n00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,176\nwith these minimal requirements, right?\n\n291\n00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:11,790\nCorrect, with some of\nthese virtual machines,\n\n292\n00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:17,110\nthey're going to require their\nown bit of hardware requirements.\n\n293\n00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:22,020\nRAM, goodness sakes,\na virtual machine you're gonna say,\n\n294\n00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,300\nat least four gigabytes of RAM.\n\n295\n00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,520\nBecause that virtual machine,\nit's still gonna need it's own ram.\n\n296\n00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,050\nYeah.\n\n297\n00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,180\nIt's been up.\n\n298\n00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,750\nThis is just for installing the actual\nregular server role is what we're talking.\n\n299\n00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,920\nIf you're gonna be\nrunning virtual machines,\n\n300\n00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,570\nevery single virtual machine is gonna\nactually also need their particular set or\n\n301\n00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,460\namount of RAM and\nhard drive space as well.\n\n302\n00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,690\nSo we'd also have to account for that too.\n\n303\n00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,080\nSo mostly when we start thinking\nabout the idea of doing this\n\n304\n00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,700\nwe want to actually try to put\nas much RAM into the computer.\n\n305\n00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,440\nAnd also, the idea of hard drive space.\n\n306\n00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,150\nIt depends on how you want to do this.\n\n307\n00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,810\nYou're either going to again max out\nthe amount of harddrive space you can,\n\n308\n00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,710\nas much money as you can put into it.\n\n309\n00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,060\nOr you match even going into looking\nat the idea of connecting to\n\n310\n00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,170\nsomething like a storage area network as\nwell to give us better performance too.\n\n311\n00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,530\nSo those are kinda the basic requirements.\n\n312\n00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,282\nRemember, that every\nsystem will be different,\n\n313\n00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:18,760\nbut since we're focusing in on Hyper V,\nhere is the minimum.\n\n314\n00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,680\nAgain, the idea of\nactually having more RAM.\n\n315\n00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,520\nMore hard drive space and of course\nmultiple processors or a single processor.\n\n316\n00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,910\nYou'll usually want multiple processors.\n\n317\n00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,810\nWe're gonna be You'll be doing this,\nyou get better performance.\n\n318\n00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,555\nNow, along with hyper V, we do have\nthe server, server side, hyper V.\n\n319\n00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:37,480\nMm-hm. Right? That's going on\nour Windows server 2012 R2.\n\n320\n00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,815\nWe also have a client hyper-v.\n\n321\n00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:44,175\nThis client Hyper-v,\nruns on Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.\n\n322\n00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:49,415\nAnd this for the requirements,\na little bit different for those.\n\n323\n00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:52,990\nYou know, on my system here, on the PC.\n\n324\n00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,890\nSo it says here that you got a one\ngigahertz processor for minimum and\n\n325\n00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,980\nwe need two gigabytes of RAM for\na 64 bit hard drive space there and\n\n326\n00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,990\nscrolling on down it says additional\nrequirements to use certain features.\n\n327\n00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,560\nSo down here,\nI'll just kinda highlight where we're at.\n\n328\n00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,256\nSo, client Hyper-V requires\na 64-bit system with second\n\n329\n00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,570\nlevel address translation.\n\n330\n00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,020\nNow, Ronnie really quick what is SLAT?\n\n331\n00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,049\nHow does it help us?\n\n332\n00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,830\nThis is actually what allows us to\nreally get by some of the limitations\n\n333\n00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,470\nthat we would've had without the idea\nof second level address translation.\n\n334\n00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,320\nTo allow us to get access\nto the real hardware is\n\n335\n00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,340\nwhat really allows us to do here.\n\n336\n00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,840\nSo, instead of actually just saying\nwe're gonna emulate the software\n\n337\n00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,620\nwe're actually now allowing it to go in\nand find actual address spaces in our RAM.\n\n338\n00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,202\nOr do it.\n\n339\n00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:47,964\nMm-hm.\n\n340\n00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:53,320\nAll right so along with having\nthat slat capability there Mm-hm.\n\n341\n00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,220\nAn additional 2 gigabytes of ram.\n\n342\n00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,930\nSo, what we have to have for\n\n343\n00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:05,810\nour 64 bit RAMs so we have to have\nat least 2 gigabytes for 64 bit.\n\n344\n00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,800\nSo to use Hyper V for\na client side Hyper V,\n\n345\n00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,380\nyou have to have at least four\ngigabytes of RAM in our systems.\n\n346\n00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,740\nAnd PC's today,\nlet me scroll up a little more.\n\n347\n00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,420\nIn PC's today, generally four gigabytes\nof RAM is kind of the minimum we see,\n\n348\n00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,540\nmore or less on on towers.\n\n349\n00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,170\nIf we're having small form factor PC or\nlaptops,\n\n350\n00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,880\nperhaps you would go a little bit lower.\n\n351\n00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,520\nRemember netbooks?\n\n352\n00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,100\nI do.\nRemember those little guys?\n\n353\n00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,070\nThey didn't have much RAM at all.\n\n354\n00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,080\nYeah.\n\n355\n00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,330\nNow there was one other requirement that\nwe saw there that we may have seen it.\n\n356\n00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,270\nAlso, remember that your CPU has support\nin what we call the virtualization,\n\n357\n00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,410\nas well, right?\n\n358\n00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,190\nSo, a lot of times,\nyou actually see the IBM intel VT, for\n\n359\n00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,510\nthe virtualization technology,\nor the AMD-B.\n\n360\n00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,840\nThis means that both the AMD and\n\n361\n00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,340\nthe intel will be able to support\nthe virtualization, and you go into bios.\n\n362\n00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,740\nInto the BIOS screen there to be\nable to enable it or disable it.\n\n363\n00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,170\nA lot of times you may get a machine\nthat comes right from the factory, and\n\n364\n00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,410\nyou do have the support for it.\n\n365\n00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,560\nIt's actually disabled.\n\n366\n00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,120\nYou may need to turn it on.\n\n367\n00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,250\nSo, again, go ahead and check that as\nwell if you're going to be doing this.\n\n368\n00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,320\nThis is true whether you're actually\ndoing the Server 2012 install or\n\n369\n00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,730\nthe client side Hyper-V as well.\n\n370\n00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,310\nYeah, Ronnie on this PC\nhere do have our Skycam.\n\n371\n00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,900\nI could shut this PC down and\nwe could take a look at the BIOS.\n\n372\n00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,820\nYeah, so with our Skycam it's\nnot the clearest, right there.\n\n373\n00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,920\nBut sure enough.\n\n374\n00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,130\nSo up there at the top,\nvirtualization it is is enabled, and\n\n375\n00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,600\nthat is what we are after to enable it.\n\n376\n00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,360\nSo it could be that our systems have that\ncapability to virtualize machines but\n\n377\n00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,880\nin the bios.\n\n378\n00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,760\nIt could be disabled, not allowing that.\n\n379\n00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,720\nYeah.\n\n380\n00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,645\nNot allowing it to run.\n\n381\n00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,190\nMm-hm.\n\n382\n00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,200\nAnd so, we can check in there, and\nsure enough, you know, mine is enabled.\n\n383\n00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,510\nSo, we can bring up virtual machines,\nand we can bring up hyper V,\n\n384\n00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,100\nand things would work out well.\n\n385\n00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,520\nAll right.\nSo, now that we do have it enabled in our\n\n386\n00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,410\nbios and everything is good, So, Ronnie,\nso we've got our hardware requirements,\n\n387\n00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,620\nwe know how to turn on and\nmake sure that our PCs can run it.\n\n388\n00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,220\nWe know what it is and\nwe know what we can use it for,\n\n389\n00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,160\nwhy we could need it,\nthose sorts of things.\n\n390\n00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,280\nWhat's next.\n\n391\n00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,920\nWhere do we go from here.\n\n392\n00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,220\nYeah.\nOur next adventure here, of course,\n\n393\n00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,130\nis to get ready for the install process.\n\n394\n00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,750\nOr to turn on the actual\nrole that we need.\n\n395\n00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,560\nWe're actually doing the Windows\nserver Hyper-V here.\n\n396\n00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,320\nAnd enable it and\nthen get it ready to configure and\n\n397\n00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,106\nwe'll talk about that\nprocess as we go along.\n\n398\n00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:39,688\nYep.\n\n399\n00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:45,880\nAll right, Ronnie at this point we\nare switching gears a little bit so\n\n400\n00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,090\nwe'll now get into\ninstalling the feature or\n\n401\n00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,720\ninstalling the,\nbe able to run Hyper-V on there.\n\n402\n00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,290\nSo it's just, we do have a few minutes\nleft but because we are switching,\n\n403\n00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,115\nlet's go ahead and take a break here.\n\n404\n00:22:59,115 --> 00:23:02,690\nMm-hm.\nAnd when we get back let's get Hyper-V\n\n405\n00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,820\nup and running and we'll start looking\nat creating some virtual machines.\n\n406\n00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,510\nSounds good.\n\n407\n00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,812\nAll right,\nwe'll get into that stuff after the break.\n\n408\n00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:18,094\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back.\n\n409\n00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:19,590\nAll right, so where we left off.\n\n410\n00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,510\nWe were talking about the idea\ninstalling the rule or\n\n411\n00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,770\nthe feature, depending on whether\nwe are a server or a client, for\n\n412\n00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,760\nthe Hyper-V, and\nwe're getting started to get into.\n\n413\n00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,460\nWe'll take a look at the UI and\nbuild up some virtual machines.\n\n414\n00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,660\nBut before we actually do that,\nwith installing the rule, so, server-side.\n\n415\n00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,850\nThere are a couple of different\neditions of Windows Server 2012 R2 that\n\n416\n00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,410\ncontain Hyper-V, and\nwithin those editions there's,\n\n417\n00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:52,300\nI wouldn't really say different features,\nbut different I guess,\n\n418\n00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,900\nenvironments or different things that we\nwould choose one edition over the other.\n\n419\n00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,930\nRight, yeah, so\n\n420\n00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,840\nwe wanna make sure that we understand what\nit is that we're gonna be installing.\n\n421\n00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,874\nAnd why we would choose\nto do one over the other.\n\n422\n00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,811\nWhen it comes down to\nthe server side products here.\n\n423\n00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,978\nThere's really three different\nlevels of licensing that we have.\n\n424\n00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:11,115\nHowever you want to address it.\n\n425\n00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:16,480\nThere is actually just a regular Windows\nServer 2012 Standard Edition for us.\n\n426\n00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,420\nThere's the Windows Server 2012,\nI should say R2 with the data center.\n\n427\n00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:26,230\nAnd then there's a straight up\nMicrosoft Hyper V 2012 as well.\n\n428\n00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,760\nThat's just a bare metal hyper visor for\n\n429\n00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,250\nus, is what we actually\nhave in place here.\n\n430\n00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,360\nNow when it comes down\nto the features here.\n\n431\n00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,020\nBetween standard edition and the data\ncenter edition of the Hyper V role that\n\n432\n00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,160\nwe have, there is really no significant\ndifferences at all in terms of features\n\n433\n00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,600\nof the way that we can create virtual\nmachines and do what we need to with them.\n\n434\n00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,130\nThe major difference here for\nus is the licensing.\n\n435\n00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,680\nIn other words, the virtual machines\nthat we can actually support on\n\n436\n00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,614\nthe standard edition,\nversus the idea of the data center.\n\n437\n00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:04,725\nIf you're running a lightly\nvirtualized environment.\n\n438\n00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:08,417\nIn other words, you still have physical\nservers that you're running but\n\n439\n00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:11,987\nyou want to be able to begin the idea and\nthe process of virtualization,\n\n440\n00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:15,638\nyou are starting that process and\nyou're just starting to change over.\n\n441\n00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:17,867\nAnd you don't really need\na lot of virtual machines.\n\n442\n00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,706\nYou may choose to actually go ahead and\n\n443\n00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:22,303\ninstall Windows Server\n2012 Standard edition.\n\n444\n00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:27,960\nGo ahead and turn on the hyper-v role, or\nenable the hyper-v role, install it here.\n\n445\n00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,358\nThat will also allow you to run up to\ntwo copies of the actual Windows Server\n\n446\n00:25:33,358 --> 00:25:38,770\n2012 in virtual machines here,\nwithout any additional licensing.\n\n447\n00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,150\nNow, could you do more?\n\n448\n00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,700\nYes.\n\n449\n00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,250\nBut do you require an extra license?\n\n450\n00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,270\nYou will.\n\n451\n00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:47,694\nSo, this is actually good as long as\nyou're actually only really running two\n\n452\n00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:50,590\nseparate VMs of Windows Server 2012.\n\n453\n00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,590\nBeyond that, you'll have to\nprovide additional licensing.\n\n454\n00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:59,760\nSo the advantage of going to the Windows\nServer 2012 R2 Data Center edition, is\n\n455\n00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,100\nthat when you install that on a physical\nserver and you do the hyper-V, you can run\n\n456\n00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,800\nas many Windows Server 2012 editions as\nyou choose to in a virtual environment.\n\n457\n00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,650\nAnd they actually provide for a different\nway to manage the actual licensing but\n\n458\n00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,260\nthat is an unlimited licensing for you.\n\n459\n00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,500\nSo in that sense,\n\n460\n00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,015\nyou would choose to do that maybe\nin a real production environment,\n\n461\n00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:26,640\nin which you're virtualizing all of your\nservers and everything, versus the idea of\n\n462\n00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,140\nthat lightly virtualized environment where\nyou're actually only running maybe a few\n\n463\n00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,390\ndifferent services instead in\nthat virtual environment itself.\n\n464\n00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,170\nNow what makes that actually different for\nus is that there's another one.\n\n465\n00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,210\nSo on both the Server 2012 editions.\n\n466\n00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,320\nThese do cost money.\n\n467\n00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,350\nAnd depending on whether you're just\ngetting a retail licence versus a volume\n\n468\n00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,350\nlicense here.\n\n469\n00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,460\nIt can again cost between several hundred\ndollars to several thousand dollars\n\n470\n00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,510\nto make everything work like this.\n\n471\n00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,340\nMicrosoft does offer a free\nalternative solution for\n\n472\n00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,800\nyou which is the Microsoft\nhyper V 2012 as well.\n\n473\n00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,200\nAnd you can go to Microsoft and\ndownload that and you can run that.\n\n474\n00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,910\nNow we talk about using just\nthe Microsoft hyper v, okay,\n\n475\n00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,510\nthat has none of the features of server.\n\n476\n00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,630\nIt really is just that one particular\nrole that you're installing.\n\n477\n00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,610\nAnd it allows you to create as many\nvirtualization of many virtual machines as\n\n478\n00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,780\nyou want to, as long as you\nalready got licensing for it.\n\n479\n00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,220\nSo for you, can you go out and\ngo, oh okay,\n\n480\n00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,330\nI'm just going to buy twelve\ncopies of Windows server 2012.\n\n481\n00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,390\nYes.\n\n482\n00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,880\nBut the better idea is for\nyou to ready say hey look\n\n483\n00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,940\nwhat I'm doing is I'm going to\nmigrate over to Microsoft here.\n\n484\n00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,090\nYou may choose to do that.\n\n485\n00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,040\nBecause it's free it makes it easy whether\nyou are actually in a small environment.\n\n486\n00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,530\nOr whether you're in a large environment\nthat you want to move over to that.\n\n487\n00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:55,080\nSo, for example, if you were setting up,\nlet's say, your web server here, okay?\n\n488\n00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,480\nYou might actually say, look,\nI want to set this up, but\n\n489\n00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,385\nI want to actually make\na smaller footprint.\n\n490\n00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:01,785\nI also want to be able to virtualize that,\nbut\n\n491\n00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:05,584\nwithout having to actually purchase\nWindows Server 2012 to do so.\n\n492\n00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,879\nYou can run the Microsoft hyper-v and\n\n493\n00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:12,756\nthen run your particular own edition of\nyour operating system that you want to for\n\n494\n00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:16,500\nyour web server inside it\neven in a small environment.\n\n495\n00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,780\nAnd later on as you choose to.\n\n496\n00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,830\nYou go hey,\nwe're going to do this virtualization,\n\n497\n00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,970\nyou've already got something in place and\nit's absolutely free.\n\n498\n00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,320\nSo it allows you to be able to do that\nas a stand alone product by itself,\n\n499\n00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,530\nall for free here.\n\n500\n00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,859\nAnd all you have to do is worry about\nlicensing for your virtual machines.\n\n501\n00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:33,867\nSo there's a lot of different\nways that you can approach this,\n\n502\n00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:36,548\ndepending on your need and\nwhat you actually want to do.\n\n503\n00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,601\nNow if you're doing that, with\nthe Microsoft Hyper V, you have no other\n\n504\n00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:45,450\nfeatures, so don't count on being able\nto install other things along with it.\n\n505\n00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,840\nYou're just running that one role here and\nit's a very solid role.\n\n506\n00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,430\nIt works very well,\nvery high performance here.\n\n507\n00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,330\nSo, it's another thing\nthat you can think about.\n\n508\n00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,550\nBut the management of it is not easy.\n\n509\n00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,460\nThe majority of it is command line.\n\n510\n00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,068\nYou can use some of the other\ntools in the server manager\n\n511\n00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:01,720\nin 2012 to manage the server.\n\n512\n00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,350\nBut the installation itself,\n\n513\n00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,570\nthe basic setup all has to be done through\nthe console at the very beginning.\n\n514\n00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,460\nAnd all command line.\n\n515\n00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:16,100\nYep, now, Ronnie, so on my PC here,\nall right, I did go just jump over\n\n516\n00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,370\nto the CDW to take a look, you're talking\nabout hundreds to several thousand- Yep.\n\n517\n00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,910\nSo, here for our R2 data center, for\n\n518\n00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:29,098\na license We're looking at just\nabout six grand to purchase this.\n\n519\n00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:35,808\nAnd to compare it, just go down here and\nthen click on server standard.\n\n520\n00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,870\nAll right, 864 bucks.\n\n521\n00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,170\nYeah.\nSo\n\n522\n00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,815\nquite a jump to go from\nstandard to data center.\n\n523\n00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:42,460\nYeah.\n\n524\n00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:49,870\nNow let's say that, like me, I like to try\nthings out and kind of get your feet wet.\n\n525\n00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,030\nOver on the TechNet Evaluation Center,\n\n526\n00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:59,550\nthis is technet.microsoft.com/en-us/\nevalcenter is that address.\n\n527\n00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:04,480\nAnd over here there are,\nyou can download an evaluation copy\n\n528\n00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,540\nof Server 2012 and Windows 8.1.\n\n529\n00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:13,520\nAnd on these you get I mean its\nlike a time bomb where you get so\n\n530\n00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,040\nmany days to use it before\nit asks to validate and\n\n531\n00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:24,950\non here right so we've got 2012 R2\nwe've got 8.1 And then over under\n\n532\n00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:30,300\ntheir download side, There it is We got\nthat guy right there, Hyper-V Server 2012.\n\n533\n00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,740\nSo we got that and\n\n534\n00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,330\nyou can download it here and,\nroll it up and install on your machine.\n\n535\n00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,420\nAnd I think you can get three months\nout of it, and, at that point,\n\n536\n00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,970\nyou just tear it down, and rebuild it.\n\n537\n00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,440\nYeah use it some more and.\n\n538\n00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,890\nYeah, as long as you're doing it for\nevaluation Microsoft doesn't mind.\n\n539\n00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,300\nIf you're trying to run your business off\nof it, they might actually ask you for\n\n540\n00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,480\nsome money at that point.\n\n541\n00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,170\n[LAUGH] So they are limited in\nterms of those trial editions.\n\n542\n00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,950\nGreat way to actually get your hands\non it to again install these to see\n\n543\n00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,230\nwhat it is that you\nactually want to do here.\n\n544\n00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,960\nNow, are there some other differences\nbetween standard and data center?\n\n545\n00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,410\nIn terms of the Windows Server, yes.\n\n546\n00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,950\nYou can have access to a lot more\nhardware, but overall though for\n\n547\n00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,860\nthe Hyper-V, the functionality is\nreally not that different, okay,\n\n548\n00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,618\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n549\n00:31:17,618 --> 00:31:18,390\nMm-hm.\n\n550\n00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,750\nYep.\nAll right Ronnie,\n\n551\n00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,970\nso now that we've got this what?\n\n552\n00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:22,990\nWhat's next?\n\n553\n00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,740\nWhere do you wanna go from here?\n\n554\n00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,550\nFrom this point here, right, the idea of\njust talking about it has been enough.\n\n555\n00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,970\nYou've heard me and you've heard Nate\nkind of drone on about it enough here but\n\n556\n00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,150\nwe're still gonna be talking but we do\nwant to get into the idea of installing.\n\n557\n00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,620\nNow I did fail to mention one\naddition of Hyper-V that Nate\n\n558\n00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,980\ndid actually give us\nthe specifications for.\n\n559\n00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,860\nWhich is also the client-side Hyper-V\nthat runs inside of Windows 8 as well.\n\n560\n00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,006\nNow when we start taking a look at this.\n\n561\n00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:53,047\nNate, do you know really a lot of\ndifferences between what we have here and\n\n562\n00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:54,230\nthe server edition?\n\n563\n00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,670\nYeah, there are some.\n\n564\n00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,155\nSome of the specifics I can't think\nof off the top of my head, but\n\n565\n00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:05,407\nthe server side Hyper V is just\nthe full Monty, everything.\n\n566\n00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:11,013\nAnd client side Hyper V, there's a couple\nof features that are stripped out of it.\n\n567\n00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:15,633\nMyself off the top of my head,\nI cannot think exactly what they are, but\n\n568\n00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:20,484\nAs far as spitting up a VM and using it,\nadding in multiple hard drives, and\n\n569\n00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:23,680\nark adapters, and exporting these guys.\n\n570\n00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,690\nThat all is still there.\n\n571\n00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,309\nLike you can't do,\nin client's side Hyper-V,\n\n572\n00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:34,060\nyou can't do domain controller cloning and\nthings of that sort.\n\n573\n00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,540\nYou can in server,\n\n574\n00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,910\nbut some of those businessy stuff,\nyou won't be able to do in client view.\n\n575\n00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,570\nMost of the time when you\nare trying to do this,\n\n576\n00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,360\nlet's say with hyper v inside of\nthe side of the client's side as well,\n\n577\n00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,080\nthey recommend that if you're doing this,\nyou may do it for testing, right?\n\n578\n00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,720\nYou may build a machine, but\nyou want to run a production,\n\n579\n00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,640\nyou may go in and\nimport it into the server side.\n\n580\n00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,430\nSo a lot of the times,\nyou're building a test environment,\n\n581\n00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,800\nyou might use the idea of\nthe client side hyper v.\n\n582\n00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,788\nA full data center environment, again,\n\n583\n00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:02,190\nmay be actually the way\nthat you want to go again.\n\n584\n00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,650\nThat point you might move up to\nthe Windows 2012 Data Center Edition,\n\n585\n00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,430\nin terms of that full virtualization.\n\n586\n00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,250\nDepending on what your choice is, and\nthose are scenarios that you may actually\n\n587\n00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,530\nchoose to take a look at, depending\non the edition that you need here.\n\n588\n00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,140\nOkay?\n\n589\n00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,620\nSo, Nate,\nwhich one are we gonna start off with?\n\n590\n00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,750\nYou actually do have both\nWindows 8.1 as well as.\n\n591\n00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,560\nServer 2012 to enable the feature.\n\n592\n00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,510\nSo which one do we want them to do?\n\n593\n00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,570\nYou know, we can do Server for\neveryone first.\n\n594\n00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,796\n[CROSSTALK] I mean,\nit really doesn't matter either way.\n\n595\n00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:34,060\nSo on my machine here,\n\n596\n00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,860\nwe do have some stand alone computers,\nthey're off-site here.\n\n597\n00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,070\nAnd so we're going to remote\ndesktop into these guys and\n\n598\n00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,760\nfirst ones first we'll go ahead and\ninstall it into a Windows server.\n\n599\n00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,200\nAnd for Windows server,\n\n600\n00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,700\nwe can just open up Windows server manager\nhere and in server manager we can go and\n\n601\n00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,020\nlook at all of our stuff and go to our\ndashboard and get an overview on things.\n\n602\n00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,160\nBut what we are after.\n\n603\n00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,470\nIs up here on the manage, and\nthen we will add roles and features.\n\n604\n00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,930\nAnd we get our little wizard here, and\nwe will click on next in our wizard.\n\n605\n00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:20,160\nAnd we'll just click on next on this\nscreen and on our server selection,\n\n606\n00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,160\nwe're working with this one,\nso we'll click on next again.\n\n607\n00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,040\nAnd here we go.\n\n608\n00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,930\nSo now in our server rules, we got this\nguy down here, right there, Hyper V.\n\n609\n00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,485\nSo we'll click on that,\nit's gonna want to install some of\n\n610\n00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:37,505\nthe management tools along with it,\nlike how to read manager, which, you know,\n\n611\n00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:42,555\nwe won't need to use it unless we,\nyou know, remotely knew it but,\n\n612\n00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:48,087\nwe need this guy so we will add those\nfeatures and we will click on next.\n\n613\n00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:52,367\nWe're not going to add any other features\nat this point, so we'll next through it.\n\n614\n00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:55,237\nAnd we will next again.\n\n615\n00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:55,797\nAlright.\n\n616\n00:34:55,797 --> 00:34:57,107\nSo, for\n\n617\n00:34:57,107 --> 00:35:02,070\nthis stuff we're going to set up some of\nthose initial things along with hyper v.\n\n618\n00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:08,330\nSo for well I guess some of this would be\nbeneficial to see it within the client.\n\n619\n00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,549\nSo we won't give it any network\nadapters at this point.\n\n620\n00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,040\nAnd we won't really set up any\nlive migrations at this point.\n\n621\n00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,180\nAnd now, for these default stores,\n\n622\n00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,020\nwe can change,\nshould we change these like within?\n\n623\n00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,770\nLet's go ahead and change them.\n\n624\n00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,350\nAll right, change them right now?\n\n625\n00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,710\nNo, you can change them later on.\n\n626\n00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,700\nIf you didn't want to change them,\n\n627\n00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,380\nwe'll go ahead and sometimes you may\nactually want to choose to store your\n\n628\n00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,370\nbigger virtual machines in\na different location then default,\n\n629\n00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,720\nthis is where you can do it or you can do\nit later on either way it is possible.\n\n630\n00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,460\n<< We will just do it here\nwhile we are all right here.\n\n631\n00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,360\nSo the default location for\nthe virtual hard disk files.\n\n632\n00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,510\nNow for a virtual hard disk,\nwhich we'll get into more.\n\n633\n00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,210\nWhat's so funny?\n\n634\n00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:55,980\nSounds good.\n\n635\n00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,730\nRight?\nGood, okay.\n\n636\n00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,530\nSo these virtual hard disks they will\nappear as just a single file- Yeah.\n\n637\n00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,120\nTo the host OS right.\n\n638\n00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,030\nSo our host operating system\nthat's running HyperV.\n\n639\n00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,960\nTo the guest operating system, it'll\nappear as just a full-fledged hard drive.\n\n640\n00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,780\nSo that's what it means by\nthe virtual hard drive files.\n\n641\n00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:25,960\nAnd for this one we will create a new\nfolder called virtuals and then VHDs.\n\n642\n00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,050\nAll right.\nSounds good.\n\n643\n00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:30,410\nAnd for\nthe virtual machine configuration files,\n\n644\n00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,680\nwe will create a folder\ncalled virtuals and\n\n645\n00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,790\nwe'll call this one VMs,\nor virtual machines.\n\n646\n00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,660\nSo I have our virtual machine,\nour configuration files, some of the files\n\n647\n00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:51,125\nthat tell the host OS what hardware it\nhas and, you know, just the settings.\n\n648\n00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,855\nIt's once we get into the Hyper-V manager,\nlike I said,\n\n649\n00:36:53,855 --> 00:36:55,835\nwe'll put a face with the name.\n\n650\n00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:59,635\nThe VMs will go in one spot and\nthe VHDs will go in another spot.\n\n651\n00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,170\nWe'll click on next.\n\n652\n00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:06,410\nAnd I'm pretty sure that we will\nneed to restart that server at\n\n653\n00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,880\nleast once to install that hyper visor.\n\n654\n00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,880\nSo click on that and we will click on\ninstall and let this guy churn away.\n\n655\n00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,680\nYeah.\nNow,\n\n656\n00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,860\nthe installation of this is\nrelatively straight-forward, right?\n\n657\n00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,390\nWe walk through the ad-servers and\nfeatures role for us.\n\n658\n00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,430\nAnd we choose the actual features\nthat we want to actually install\n\n659\n00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,250\nand what we can do.\n\n660\n00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,500\nNotice it gives us some\nbasic configuration.\n\n661\n00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,640\nJust because we can actually\nenter in some configurations now\n\n662\n00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,510\ndoesn't mean we can't\nchange them later on but\n\n663\n00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,440\nit's actually giving us a default,\nis what we might actually choose to do.\n\n664\n00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,270\nWith this particular process on\ninstalling this particular server role,\n\n665\n00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,980\nit's not gonna take too long for\nit to install.\n\n666\n00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,620\nThe nice thing about the way that\nWindows actually manages this,\n\n667\n00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,260\nright, is the ability of course,\nfor us to go ahead and\n\n668\n00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,900\ninstall it just like we would any other\nrole like a DNS server or a DHCP server.\n\n669\n00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,490\nAnd I'm assuming that since it kicked\noff it, it's probably restarting.\n\n670\n00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,750\nAnd that's what we have here.\n\n671\n00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,750\nSo it's actually restarting and\nactually doing everything.\n\n672\n00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:09,330\nNow the interesting thing about\nthe way that the hyperview works here.\n\n673\n00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,160\nOn the Windows server 2012.\n\n674\n00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,580\nIs that we began with\nan operating system right there.\n\n675\n00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,790\nOn the bare metal.\n\n676\n00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,750\nSo it was just a nonvirtualized\nmachine at this point.\n\n677\n00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,555\nAnd what it would seem like, then,\nif we're installing the Hyper-V roll,\n\n678\n00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:28,660\nthat this would make it just\na type two hyper visor.\n\n679\n00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,310\nSo just like what we talked about here.\n\n680\n00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,680\nThat we're installing it on top\nof the existing operating system.\n\n681\n00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,540\nBut the way that Windows Server\n2012 ends up working, and\n\n682\n00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,730\neven in previous editions\nof Windows Server.\n\n683\n00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,570\nIs that it actually changes it.\n\n684\n00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,320\nSo during this installation, this reboot\nprocess, it's now going to actually take\n\n685\n00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,610\nthat hyper-V, that hypervisor,\nand actually put it below,\n\n686\n00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,020\ndirectly on top of the hardware and\nnow run the host operating system,\n\n687\n00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,880\nthe one that Nate was just working in\non top of that and that will now manage\n\n688\n00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,010\nthe way that the actual other virtual\nmachines that Nate will create to be able\n\n689\n00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:08,410\nto access the hardware as well\nto manage the control on that.\n\n690\n00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:13,924\nSo it's actually kind of a neat process in\nhow the operating system that Nate will\n\n691\n00:39:13,924 --> 00:39:19,730\nreboot into is actually a virtual machine\nthat is running on top of the hyper visor.\n\n692\n00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,060\nSo let's go ahead and\nturn on Hyper-V for For the client.\n\n693\n00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,630\nSounds good.\n\n694\n00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,760\nThat will work.\n\n695\n00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,500\nYup.\nSo on this machine here, so\n\n696\n00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,070\nwe'll go ahead and open up the last\nremaining remote desktop that we have.\n\n697\n00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,540\nAnd on this guy let me click\non that because it bugs.\n\n698\n00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:40,180\nAnd so what we will do then to\nturn that on, it is a feature so\n\n699\n00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:45,660\nwe'll go to programs and features.\n\n700\n00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,030\nThere we go, programs and features.\n\n701\n00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,100\nAnd now Hyper- V is so\nit's not installed by default.\n\n702\n00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,650\nAnd so we want to turn Windows\nfeatures on or off, right?\n\n703\n00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,570\nSo that guy right there.\n\n704\n00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,710\nThat's it.\nWe will click on that and\n\n705\n00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,270\nin this window there we go.\n\n706\n00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,280\nRight there.\nHyper-V.\n\n707\n00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,120\nNow we do get a little drop down here.\n\n708\n00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,913\nSo we got the the management tools\nwhere it's at is the hyper v manager.\n\n709\n00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:10,242\nSo we do want to include that so\n\n710\n00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:15,370\nthose are tools in the The PowerShell\nstuff, I believe we will get\n\n711\n00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:21,820\ninto some PowerShell commands to\nmanage some of this stuff here later.\n\n712\n00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,890\nSo I'll just go ahead and\ncollapse all of this, and\n\n713\n00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,640\njust click that one box which\nwill include, oh, it doesn't say.\n\n714\n00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,810\nIt looks like it's,\nis that guy, no, included?\n\n715\n00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,320\nAll right, there we go.\n\n716\n00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,449\nAnd we will click on OK.\n\n717\n00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:46,297\nYep, so now it's actually searching for\nthe install files that it actually needs\n\n718\n00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:49,840\nto go ahead and\nenable the Hyper-V role as well, okay.\n\n719\n00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,310\nSo during this particular process as\nit's doing that, It should install\n\n720\n00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:58,010\njust about the same way that we saw that\nthe actual Windows server did, too, okay.\n\n721\n00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:02,288\nAll right, so after this stuff installs,\n\n722\n00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:06,160\nnow that server's gonna take a reboot or\ntwo.\n\n723\n00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,040\nAnd so this guy says if he should know.\n\n724\n00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,570\nThere might be something up\nwith our machine there, Ronnie,\n\n725\n00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,140\nbecause I am pretty sure that\nis the one that we need.\n\n726\n00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,300\nAnd it says that it cannot be installed,\n\n727\n00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,190\nthe processor does not\nhave SLAT capabilities.\n\n728\n00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,890\nIt may not actually be able to do it.\n\n729\n00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,740\nSo that may be one of the features\nthat we've run into as well.\n\n730\n00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,220\nSo what we would probably need to do and\nIt's almost a good time for\n\n731\n00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,550\nus to take a break, anyways.\n\n732\n00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:34,820\nLet's check and see if that action machine\ncan support the SLAT capabilities.\n\n733\n00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,890\nIt may be able to, it may not.\n\n734\n00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,890\nYeah, if anything, on our XPS right here\nit does kind of mess around with our\n\n735\n00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,810\nscreen sharing software a little bit but\nwe may just do that.\n\n736\n00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,530\nTurn it on, on the XPS here.\n\n737\n00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:55,935\nWe'll just have to be a little delicate\nwith our screen sharing software.\n\n738\n00:41:55,935 --> 00:41:56,840\nSounds good.\n\n739\n00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,380\nAll right, well,\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n740\n00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,460\nWe'll take our break here.\n\n741\n00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,284\nWe'll wait for these machines to\nfinish their reboot and, Ronnie,\n\n742\n00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:07,220\nso let's jump into that machine out there\nand see if we can't get it installed.\n\n743\n00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,390\nSounds good.\n\n744\n00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,223\nSweet.\nAll right, so,\n\n745\n00:42:09,223 --> 00:42:10,689\nwe'll get to that stuff after the break.\n\n746\n00:42:10,689 --> 00:42:14,950\n[MUSIC]\n\n747\n00:42:17,516 --> 00:42:19,830\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n748\n00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,560\nSo during the break Ronnie and\nI we pulled up the processor for\n\n749\n00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,920\nthat machine there and looked it up\non Intel 's little arc sheet and\n\n750\n00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,380\nsure enough it does not support SLAT.\n\n751\n00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,410\nSo that was a little hindsight there.\n\n752\n00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,730\nWe weren't able to get\nHyper-V installed on there.\n\n753\n00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,700\nBut there's an irony behind this, right.\n\n754\n00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,405\nSo because a client, Windows 8.1 client,\nif you're gonna do Hyper-V,\n\n755\n00:42:44,405 --> 00:42:46,975\nit requires that second\nlevel address translation.\n\n756\n00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:51,595\nThe funny thing about it, at least I think\nso, is that Windows Server 2012 R2 though,\n\n757\n00:42:51,595 --> 00:42:52,310\ndoesn't.\n\n758\n00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,590\nSo we can actually install that perfectly\nfine on the machines that we have.\n\n759\n00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,800\nThat will run perfectly fine, but\nthe client absolutely requires it.\n\n760\n00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,770\nSo that's where we had a problem.\n\n761\n00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:03,490\nBut even so, we have that,\nthe good thing is Nate has a machine\n\n762\n00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,600\nthat does support the second level address\ntranslation, and so that means he can\n\n763\n00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,440\nstill show us what he wanted to,\nwhich is installing it on Windows 8.1.\n\n764\n00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,270\nYep, so let's go and do that.\n\n765\n00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:18,270\nSo on my machine here, and yeah, so\nhopefully it doesn't interfere with\n\n766\n00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:22,470\nour screen sharing software too much,\nwhich it's been pretty good in the past.\n\n767\n00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:28,770\nAll right, so\nwe'll go back into Programs > Features.\n\n768\n00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:35,379\nAnd we will turn our Windows\nfeatures on and off and in Hyper-V,\n\n769\n00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:39,500\noh, had a little square there,\nlike, oh, no, please.\n\n770\n00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,360\nAnd so, there we go.\n\n771\n00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,750\nSo, there's the Hyper-V platform.\n\n772\n00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,010\nWe will check that, and we will click OK.\n\n773\n00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,550\nLet's go through and\ninstall those files now.\n\n774\n00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:51,890\nHopefully, the files that it\nneeds is already on here.\n\n775\n00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,430\nSo I don't think I have any\ninstallation media handy for\n\n776\n00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,670\nit to pull those files off of.\n\n777\n00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,415\nAnd then, yeah, we'll just let this\nguy go ahead and start and oh, geez,\n\n778\n00:44:00,415 --> 00:44:01,610\nthat was awfully fast!\n\n779\n00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:10,230\nNow, this PC, it will take a couple\nof reboots to finish installing.\n\n780\n00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:15,590\nSo it needs to install the Hyper-Visor and\nso it will take a couple of reboots.\n\n781\n00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:20,030\nNow, Ronnie,\nshould we go ahead and reboot now?\n\n782\n00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,550\nLet's go ahead and reboot.\n\n783\n00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,300\nTurn off your screen sharing software.\n\n784\n00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,870\nBut we can actually jump\nover to my machine.\n\n785\n00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,609\nAnd we can check out the Windows\n2012 Server as we're actually doing\n\n786\n00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:29,412\nthis, right.\n\n787\n00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:29,979\nYup.\n\n788\n00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:32,615\nAnd that guy is on 29.\n\n789\n00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:33,917\n29?\n\n790\n00:44:33,917 --> 00:44:35,216\n230.29 or is it-?\n\n791\n00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:36,045\nCorrect.\n\n792\n00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:36,850\n230.29.\n\n793\n00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,970\nAnd we'll connect here.\n\n794\n00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,610\nAnd then connect back in.\n\n795\n00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:47,590\nRemember that this is actually\nthe Windows 2012 machine that we started\n\n796\n00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,570\nthe Hyper-V install role on.\n\n797\n00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,570\nAnd so what is the- I don't\nthink I made you an account.\n\n798\n00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,130\nSo just put in Nathan.\n\n799\n00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,550\nAnd pounds for that I use for everything.\n\n800\n00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,800\nYour secret password?\n\n801\n00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,400\nSuper secret password?\n\n802\n00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,600\nIt's not a secret anymore if you know it.\n\n803\n00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,046\nYour super secret password,\nwhat's the name of the machine?\n\n804\n00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:07,670\nHyper-V.\n\n805\n00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,265\nHyper-V, Nathan?\n\n806\n00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:19,215\nMan, this XPS has a solve state,\noh, okay, never mind.\n\n807\n00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:20,385\nYeah.\nI was gonna say, man,\n\n808\n00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,675\nby the time you get that thing.\n\n809\n00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:25,385\nThat's because of my typing abilities\nnot because of the performance of\n\n810\n00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:26,575\nthe machine itself.\n\n811\n00:45:26,575 --> 00:45:28,960\nRight.\nSo, yeah, if I could spell it would help.\n\n812\n00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,710\nUnless you know what your password\nword will help you even faster.\n\n813\n00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,757\nRight.\nAll right, so\n\n814\n00:45:32,757 --> 00:45:34,063\nhere we are on this machine and\n\n815\n00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,939\nyou said that now that we'll take\n[INAUDIBLE], the only thing I'm\n\n816\n00:45:36,939 --> 00:45:41,160\ndoing right now is just verifying that the\nHyper-V role was successfully installed.\n\n817\n00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,720\nInside of the server manager,\nI can see the link for it right over here.\n\n818\n00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,100\nAnd it looks like everything\nis actually good.\n\n819\n00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,620\nAre you telling me that it's done\non the client side there, Nate?\n\n820\n00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,660\nWell, no.\nI think it's in the second or\n\n821\n00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,214\nthird reboot,\nI think this is the last one.\n\n822\n00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,830\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this, okay?\n\n823\n00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,010\nSo now that it's successfully installed,\nright.\n\n824\n00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,940\nOne of the things you need\nto be able to do, of course,\n\n825\n00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:07,510\nis to understand how to go about using\nthe actual Hyper-V interface, okay.\n\n826\n00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:11,310\nSo on your Server 2012 machine as you're\nrunning it, right, you're gonna be inside\n\n827\n00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,110\nthe of server manager and, of course,\nyou can actually click on the link here.\n\n828\n00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,040\nMine automatically popped up here.\n\n829\n00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,390\nSo I can click on the server manager\nlink that's on my task bar, and\n\n830\n00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,270\nyou'll notice that will populate all\nthe server roles that are actually\n\n831\n00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,300\ninstalled on this machine, currently.\n\n832\n00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,010\nUsually if you're running\nHyper-V on the machine,\n\n833\n00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,600\nthe recommendation is that you\ndon't actually install other roles.\n\n834\n00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,260\nCan you?\n\n835\n00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,200\nYes, but normally you actually just wanna\nleave it as being the Hyper-V role here.\n\n836\n00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,490\nSo, if I go ahead and click over on\nthe left-hand side of the navigation pane\n\n837\n00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,290\nunder Hyper-V, okay,\nyou'll notice it changes and\n\n838\n00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:46,520\ntells me that I am now in the Hyper-V\nrole here under the servers.\n\n839\n00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,750\nAnd I can right-click on the Hyper-V\nlink here in the center,\n\n840\n00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,748\nand what we're looking for\nis down under Hyper-V Manager,\n\n841\n00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:58,780\nis what we're really taking a look at,\nat this point.\n\n842\n00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,880\nSo if I go ahead and select that.\n\n843\n00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,010\nNow, in terms of the Hyper-V Manager,\nokay, whether you're actually on\n\n844\n00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:09,638\nWindows Server 2012 or\nwhether you're actually in the Windows 8.1\n\n845\n00:47:09,638 --> 00:47:13,260\nclient attribute, you'll see that\nthe experience is pretty much identical.\n\n846\n00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,550\nIt looks the same,\n\n847\n00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,050\nthe setup pretty much is the same here\nin terms of the management, okay.\n\n848\n00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:21,430\nAgain, there are some feature differences\nin terms of how many things you can do at\n\n849\n00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:26,187\none time but besides that though, you'll\nprobably see the same thing here, okay.\n\n850\n00:47:26,187 --> 00:47:30,550\nSo this three-pane management console that\nwe have here, that's pretty much standard\n\n851\n00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,290\nthroughout most of the Microsoft world,\nor the Windows world here, right.\n\n852\n00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,670\nWe have a navigation pane\nover on the left hand side,\n\n853\n00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,460\nwe have an action pane over here\non the right hand side, and\n\n854\n00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,250\nin the middle,\nthe details of what we can actually see.\n\n855\n00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,400\nThe number of virtual machines right now,\n\n856\n00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,520\nwe don't have any virtual\nmachines created.\n\n857\n00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,998\nWe also have the idea of what we call\ncheckpoints, and we'll talk about those\n\n858\n00:47:49,998 --> 00:47:53,369\na little bit later on when we do create\nvirtual machines and then even some of\n\n859\n00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:56,389\nthe characteristic details of\nthat machine that we've created.\n\n860\n00:47:56,389 --> 00:48:01,730\nSo if you are running multiple\ncomputers that are running Hyper-V,\n\n861\n00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:06,609\nyou, of course, can actually\ncontinue to add in multiple ones\n\n862\n00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:09,844\nover here on the left-hand side, okay.\n\n863\n00:48:09,844 --> 00:48:12,607\nBy connecting to another server,\nwe don't have one.\n\n864\n00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:13,989\nBut we would simply select that.\n\n865\n00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:17,640\nAnd then we would type in the name or\nthe IP address of that one.\n\n866\n00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:22,110\nAnd that would add in a second node\nover here on the left hand side for us.\n\n867\n00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,850\nAnd that way we could actually\nmanage the virtual machines on\n\n868\n00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,530\neach of those two computers.\n\n869\n00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,990\nOr multiple ones as well.\n\n870\n00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,800\nSo, we're just doing the basic\nsetup at this point.\n\n871\n00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,040\nWe're just trying introduce you\nto the interface here, okay.\n\n872\n00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,770\nSo, once I've selected\nby clicking on Hyper-V,\n\n873\n00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:41,840\nyou'll notice that the action pane kind of\nchanged over here on the right hand side.\n\n874\n00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,850\nIf I just select the Hyper-V manager\nnotice the action pane changes as well.\n\n875\n00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,530\nSo we just see a more generic version.\n\n876\n00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,890\nIf I select Hyper V, you'll now see\nthat there are many different things.\n\n877\n00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:57,660\nThat we can actually do inside of\nthe actual Hyper-V manager here.\n\n878\n00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,930\nIs what we're taking a look at so far.\n\n879\n00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:05,340\nSo notice that if I wanted to\ncreate a new virtual machine or\n\n880\n00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,560\nactually create even just a virtual\nhard drive, or go ahead and\n\n881\n00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,090\nactually do a virtual floppy disk\nWe can do all that right there.\n\n882\n00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,990\nVery easily for us to take a look at.\n\n883\n00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,830\nWe'll kind of get into that when\nwe get into creating the virtual\n\n884\n00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,921\nmachine a little bit later, but\nthat's one the options that we have.\n\n885\n00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,710\nWe of course can input a virtual\nmachine if I already have another one.\n\n886\n00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,240\nNotice it launches up and\n\n887\n00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,640\ngives me of course access to a nice\nlittle wizard system that I have.\n\n888\n00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,833\nAnd notice this says, hey,\nbefore you begin this is what you do,\n\n889\n00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:37,029\nlocate where that's gonna be,\nselect the machine you want, and\n\n890\n00:49:37,029 --> 00:49:40,300\nchoose the way that it's\ngonna import as well.\n\n891\n00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,160\nBut where it really\nbegins to get detailed,\n\n892\n00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,540\nof course,\nis in the Hyper V settings here.\n\n893\n00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,790\nIf I select that, now,\nnotice it's the control settings for\n\n894\n00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,125\nthe entire server here.\n\n895\n00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:56,330\nHyper-V settings for Hyper-V itself.\n\n896\n00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:01,390\nAnd this is where, when Nate set\nthis up during the install process,\n\n897\n00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,100\nthat we changed a couple of\nthe default settings here\n\n898\n00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,170\non the virtual hard disk here in terms\nof where we're gonna store these.\n\n899\n00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:12,830\nRemember that virtual hard drives\nare essentially files to the host machine.\n\n900\n00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,920\nSo on the machine that I'm running the\nHyper-V server, that server doesn't see\n\n901\n00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,050\nthese as real hard drives that\nserver sees these as being files and\n\n902\n00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,495\nwhat Nate did is again,\nchange it to a default location.\n\n903\n00:50:24,495 --> 00:50:27,995\nOr change the default to this new\nfolder structure that he went ahead and\n\n904\n00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:28,789\ncreated right here.\n\n905\n00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:32,506\nUnder virtuals slash VHD.\n\n906\n00:50:32,506 --> 00:50:36,498\nIf I wanted to browse into it, I could\nactually see it again using the file\n\n907\n00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:40,753\nexplorer and there's nothing in it\nbecause we haven't created anything and\n\n908\n00:50:40,753 --> 00:50:45,468\nthere's also, of course, the configuration\nfiles that Nate was also mentioning,\n\n909\n00:50:45,468 --> 00:50:47,777\nright there and then you can change this.\n\n910\n00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:49,860\nNow we don't have anything\nthat we're changing here.\n\n911\n00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,120\nSo managing remote FX.\n\n912\n00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,380\nThese are a different effects that\nwe actually have the GPU's here.\n\n913\n00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,760\nNotice that we don't have anything.\n\n914\n00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,000\nSo we can't really change that one.\n\n915\n00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,140\nAnd now we have this unusual thing.\n\n916\n00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,660\nThe non-uniform management access.\n\n917\n00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,390\nI've made,\nnon uniform memory architecture.\n\n918\n00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,300\nSo, a lot of times you have virtual\nmachines that have been created, again,\n\n919\n00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,180\nacross multiple different platforms here.\n\n920\n00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,820\nIt's actually giving you\nthat ability to span those.\n\n921\n00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,830\nIn other words,\nto be able to manage those as well.\n\n922\n00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,130\nTo bring them in if you need to.\n\n923\n00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,150\nAnd we're not talking\nabout live migrations,\n\n924\n00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:29,360\nwe may go into that later on in a future\nepisode in terms of hyper v when\n\n925\n00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,330\nwe start talking about\nthe idea of clustering.\n\n926\n00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:35,570\nBut it gives us the ability again to move\nthose virtual machines from one particular\n\n927\n00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:39,380\nserver over to another one here without\nhaving to shutdown the machines as well.\n\n928\n00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:44,620\nAnd then of course the idea of\nstorage migration is another one too.\n\n929\n00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,570\nAgain moving the actual storage\nof where one server is located.\n\n930\n00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:54,060\nAnd then of course policies that\nwe can have and again replication.\n\n931\n00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,130\nAnd these are more advanced topics\nthat we'll probably cover in\n\n932\n00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,190\na later episode that we have.\n\n933\n00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:03,010\nYou know Ronnie with that live migration,\nit's incredibly cool.\n\n934\n00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:05,420\nAnd we can have a virtual machine.\n\n935\n00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,620\nRunning on one server and\nbe able to migrate it,\n\n936\n00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:15,740\nbe able to move that machine over to\nanother server, and still have it running.\n\n937\n00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,950\nYeah.\nIncredibly awesome,\n\n938\n00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:22,740\nthat we can move things around from\nserver maintenance or who knows what.\n\n939\n00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,300\nMaybe bring something up or take something\ndown, and to be able to move those\n\n940\n00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,180\nmachines over, and to the end user who may\nbe in a cubicle somewhere logged into it,\n\n941\n00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:36,120\nor someone using it somewhere,\ncan be able to move it from one\n\n942\n00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:41,610\nsystem to another system, and with the end\nuser not really knowing anything about it.\n\n943\n00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,150\nThat's pretty awesome.\n\n944\n00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,580\nYeah.\nIt makes it very easy,\n\n945\n00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,030\nlike we talked about in\nterms of maintenance,\n\n946\n00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,020\njust like what Nate just said here.\n\n947\n00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,890\nThe other one, of course,\n\n948\n00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:53,240\nis if you actually have one server that\nmay not actually be dividing its workload\n\n949\n00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,690\nfairly easily here, we could actually\nmove it over to another server that may\n\n950\n00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,570\nactually be able to handle the workload\na little bit better, as well,\n\n951\n00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:04,760\nwithout really impacting the end user\ntoo much, sometimes you may experience\n\n952\n00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,140\nsome little performance hit every now and\nthen, but not necessarily.\n\n953\n00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,920\nSo lab migration's pretty unique here.\n\n954\n00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,960\nBut the overall manager feature though,\n\n955\n00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,550\nyou see where there's a lot of different\nthings that you can do right away.\n\n956\n00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:22,310\nAnd again, you can even control how\nthe user interacts with it, too.\n\n957\n00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,740\nSo not only the server\nin terms of managing it.\n\n958\n00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:29,590\nBut also the way that we interface with it\nin terms of the keyboard, the mouse, and\n\n959\n00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:33,130\nof course, other modes here,\nthe enhanced mode.\n\n960\n00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,190\nTo be able to operate that and\n\n961\n00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,750\nthen of course to reset all\nthese settings if we need too.\n\n962\n00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:43,100\nThat is the overall management\nconsole that we have here.\n\n963\n00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,000\nNate, is there anything else we wanna\npoint out on this that you can think of?\n\n964\n00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,300\nNo, that does look pretty good.\n\n965\n00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,330\nNow Mm-hm.\n\n966\n00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,485\nSo this on the server side.\n\n967\n00:53:53,485 --> 00:53:54,030\nMm-hm.\n\n968\n00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,570\nAll right, now let's say with\nHyper-V on the client side.\n\n969\n00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,470\nOkay.\nSo on my machine it did finish,\n\n970\n00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,150\nwe did finish rebooting it Four or\nfive times.\n\n971\n00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:05,720\n[LAUGH] And so\nnow up here to get to hyperview manager,\n\n972\n00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,720\nI am a big fan of the search.\n\n973\n00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,860\nSo just click on Start to\nget to our Start screen.\n\n974\n00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,860\nAnd then Hyper.\n\n975\n00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,700\nStart typing in Hyper we get Hyper-V.\n\n976\n00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,950\nW have the virtual machine connection.\n\n977\n00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:19,920\nWe won't get into that right now.\n\n978\n00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,130\nBut we do have the Hyper V manager\nwhich is what Ronnie was in, and\n\n979\n00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:28,660\nlaunching up it looks just\nabout near identical.\n\n980\n00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:34,030\nThere will be some features that may or\nmay not be in there.\n\n981\n00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:39,030\nBut you know of our stuff,\nwe can get into hyper v settings.\n\n982\n00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,560\nAnd on here we see that we\ndon't get that live migration.\n\n983\n00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,290\nWe don't get a lot of those features in\nthere that we saw on the server side.\n\n984\n00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:50,780\nA little bit more stripped down,\nwe can change where our hard discs are.\n\n985\n00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,680\nWe got that numis banding and\nour storage migrations.\n\n986\n00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,390\nAnd our enhanced session mode policy.\n\n987\n00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,550\nWhich is pretty cool.\n\n988\n00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:00,030\nIt'll enhanced session mode policy.\n\n989\n00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:06,660\nNormally when we connect to a virtual\nmachine, we connect to it as the console.\n\n990\n00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:11,970\nAnd so by using enhanced session\nmode policy, it basically, when\n\n991\n00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:16,630\nwe connect the virtual machine, it does\nit using RDP, or remote desktop Protocol.\n\n992\n00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:21,300\nAnd so we get a, I'd say just a bit\ndifferent experience with Dancer.\n\n993\n00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:21,810\nYep fancier.\n\n994\n00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,460\nYep fancier things share\nour clipboards and\n\n995\n00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,065\nsome of the other stuff we get with RDP.\n\n996\n00:55:26,065 --> 00:55:26,980\nMm-hm.\n\n997\n00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:31,620\nBut that's, yeah,\nfrom the client side of hyper view.\n\n998\n00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,590\nYeah.\nThose are all the settings that we get.\n\n999\n00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:39,500\nSo generally in the server there's\na lot more options there but\n\n1000\n00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,060\nas far as the Hyper-V manager itself\nwe do have virtual machines up here,\n\n1001\n00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,960\nwhich I just installed, so\nwe have none and no check points for\n\n1002\n00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,770\nthe virtual machines,\nwe don't have any of.\n\n1003\n00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:53,336\nand down in the details pane down here,\nwe would get a little thumbnail of our\n\n1004\n00:55:53,336 --> 00:55:55,637\nvirtual machine as its running,\npretty sweet.\n\n1005\n00:55:55,637 --> 00:55:58,045\nAs the virtual machine runs,\n\n1006\n00:55:58,045 --> 00:56:02,870\nwe get a screenshot of the console,\nof its little desktop.\n\n1007\n00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:07,032\nAnd then depending on if we do have\na virtual machine selected and\n\n1008\n00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:10,360\nover in the actions pane\nwe can change some of them.\n\n1009\n00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:16,780\nNow we do have some options over here,\nyou know, like the virtual switch manager.\n\n1010\n00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,780\nWe can make virtual switches for\nour virtual machines and Ronnie\n\n1011\n00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:25,030\nif I'm not mistaken I believe when we do\nget into creating these virtual machines.\n\n1012\n00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,970\nThat's where the meat of all\nof this is going to come from.\n\n1013\n00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:30,900\nYep, for our networking we'll make sure\nwe get into that and cover some of\n\n1014\n00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,710\nthe different details on how we actually\ndo connect our virtual machines to either\n\n1015\n00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,910\nour physical network or we might want to\nisolate them to a private network instead.\n\n1016\n00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:43,680\nNow Ronnie what I did do in\nthe background, I'll just minimize this.\n\n1017\n00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,180\nWe do have a server here,\na VM host we call this guy,\n\n1018\n00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,228\nthat we have running that has a lot\nof virtual machines that it hosts.\n\n1019\n00:56:51,228 --> 00:56:56,230\nYou know, Ronnie and I, we use some of\nthese virtual machines for demos and\n\n1020\n00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:00,390\nlabs, things that we can, we can break and\nwe won't feel bad about it,\n\n1021\n00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:05,100\ncuz we can either revert these virtual\nmachines to an earlier checkpoint, or\n\n1022\n00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,890\nwe can just wipe them out altogether.\n\n1023\n00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,730\nPretty convenient.\n\n1024\n00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,940\nYes.\n\n1025\n00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:16,420\nSo I did log into that,\noops, just kidding.\n\n1026\n00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,510\nAll right, here we go.\n\n1027\n00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:24,200\nSo, this is on a 2002 R2 Server, and it's\ndata center, I believe, on this guy here.\n\n1028\n00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,774\nAnd to get down to it,\njust like what Ronnie was doing,\n\n1029\n00:57:27,774 --> 00:57:31,285\nwe had to fire up good old server manager.\n\n1030\n00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:34,145\nAnd once this guy starts up and populates,\n\n1031\n00:57:34,145 --> 00:57:38,845\nwe do have the Hyper-V,\nnode is that what you call it?\n\n1032\n00:57:38,845 --> 00:57:39,345\nRole.\n\n1033\n00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:39,965\nRole, yup.\n\n1034\n00:57:39,965 --> 00:57:40,810\nOver here.\n\n1035\n00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:46,820\nAnd so we click on this guy, and\nthen over here with the VM host we can.\n\n1036\n00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,690\nThere's a lot of IP addresses\nthat we've got there.\n\n1037\n00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:49,570\nYeah, there's is.\n\n1038\n00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:55,350\nWe've set up a Nick Teaming and\nprior episodes set this stuff up.\n\n1039\n00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,560\nAnd so we can right click on this guy and\ngo down to Hyper-V manager.\n\n1040\n00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,260\nWe can also get to it through\nthe tools in Hyper-V manager.\n\n1041\n00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:06,560\nI am just really used to right\nclicking and choosing it this way.\n\n1042\n00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:13,920\nAnd firing this guy up now we can\nsee that on our virtual machines,\n\n1043\n00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,350\nwe have some under here.\n\n1044\n00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:18,440\nWe've got this guy here\na domain controller.\n\n1045\n00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,110\nThis guy is running.\n\n1046\n00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:22,140\nIts CPU usage is sitting at 0%, all right,\n\n1047\n00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:27,000\nso this guy's just sitting idle,\nwe do have the amount of memory.\n\n1048\n00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,300\nNow, of the stuff that we can virtualize,\n\n1049\n00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:35,480\none thing that we cannot\nvirtualize is RAM.\n\n1050\n00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,625\nSo we cannot give a machine more\nmemory than what we actually have.\n\n1051\n00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,030\nHard drives,\nwe can virtualize hard drives.\n\n1052\n00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:46,119\nWe can give a virtual machine a 3,\n4, 8, 9, 12,\n\n1053\n00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:51,080\n20 terabyte hard drive when we\nonly have a 1 terabyte hard drive.\n\n1054\n00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,110\nAnd so, we can set that up.\n\n1055\n00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,430\nNow of course,\nwe can't write 20 terabytes of data\n\n1056\n00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:59,070\nif we only have one terabyte\navailable on a physical disk.\n\n1057\n00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:03,460\nBut one thing we can assign more of,\nand that is RAM.\n\n1058\n00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,390\nSo this guy's only eating up 1 GB of RAM.\n\n1059\n00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:10,330\nAnd here he has been up yeah,\nfour hours or four days, 16 hours.\n\n1060\n00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:11,770\nThat's four days, yeah.\n\n1061\n00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,760\nFour days he's been sitting there.\n\n1062\n00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,050\nFour days, I wonder,\nI wonder if it rebooted?\n\n1063\n00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:16,920\nProbably did.\n\n1064\n00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,300\nProbably.\n\n1065\n00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,752\nSo we've got some other\nmachines down here, some in,\n\n1066\n00:59:21,752 --> 00:59:24,090\noff state, so they're power down.\n\n1067\n00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:28,480\nNow, with these virtual machines,\nthink of them as a real computer,\n\n1068\n00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:35,280\nas a physical computer,\ncuz it behaves like it is a real machine.\n\n1069\n00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,660\nSo this guy, he is powered off.\n\n1070\n00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:43,700\nOn the saved estate, this one,\nit was reverted from a checkpoint.\n\n1071\n00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:49,140\nAnd so it saved, like in this one,\nlike a hibernation sort of thing.\n\n1072\n00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,680\nSee down here we have\nsome Windows 7 machines.\n\n1073\n00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,040\nSo these guys are currently running, and\n\n1074\n00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,940\nif I click on them, then these guys\nthey don't have any checkpoints, or\n\n1075\n01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:05,890\nsnapshots, these are just\nlike a quick little image,\n\n1076\n01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:09,530\nmore or less, of it's current\nconfiguration, it's running state.\n\n1077\n01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:15,000\nSo if we were to make any changes to this\nvirtual machine, we can revert Back so\n\n1078\n01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,522\nkind of like a system restore more or\nless.\n\n1079\n01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:22,130\nSo we can revert that\nvirtual machine back.\n\n1080\n01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:27,150\nSo this guy doesn't have any, so\nwe've given him a bit more RAM and\n\n1081\n01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,930\nhe's up there and running.\n\n1082\n01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:35,030\nSo, as these virtual machines,\njust the configuration files themselves.\n\n1083\n01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:38,560\nThey don't take up a whole lot of space,\nI mean we could have many,\n\n1084\n01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,580\nmany virtual machines now because\nwe can't virtualize more RAM.\n\n1085\n01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:48,140\nThis current machine we have right\nhere only has 8 gigabytes of RAM.\n\n1086\n01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:53,320\nSo we could only spin up three virtual\nmachines before we run out of RAM.\n\n1087\n01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:59,090\nEven though we only have what,\n3 gigabytes there and 1 gigabyte there.\n\n1088\n01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:03,370\nOur post operating system\nalso needs its RAM.\n\n1089\n01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,560\nAs well.\n\n1090\n01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:09,080\nSo if we've got our checkpoints and\ndown in our details pane,\n\n1091\n01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:14,830\nwe do a little screen shot there and\nwhen it was created No, generations.\n\n1092\n01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:17,860\nAnd now we'll get into generations when\nwe create that much of machines but\n\n1093\n01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:23,980\nwe have generation one, we have generation\ntwo, which we get some new stuff.\n\n1094\n01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:28,150\nGeneration two we get secure boot,\nwith that, which is kinda fancy.\n\n1095\n01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:31,310\nClustered, right, so if we're gonna\ncluster these guys together for\n\n1096\n01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:32,660\nfailover, and everything.\n\n1097\n01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:38,030\nHeartbeat and integration services,\nwhich, we will get integration services.\n\n1098\n01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,190\nYeah a little bit later.\n\n1099\n01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:43,180\nYep, so we got some tabs down here\nwe can just click on some things.\n\n1100\n01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:46,880\nDynamic memory whether or\nnot the memory can fluctuate.\n\n1101\n01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,050\nIf the virtual machine is starting to run\ninto some tasks that it needs more memory\n\n1102\n01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,120\nit can take more.\n\n1103\n01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:57,580\nOr if it is sitting there idle\nit can release that memory for\n\n1104\n01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,000\nother machines to take it over and\n\n1105\n01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,106\ninto the networking so we do see that\nwhat is assigned a network adaptor,\n\n1106\n01:02:06,106 --> 01:02:11,150\non the ITProTV LAN and\nhere is its IP address.\n\n1107\n01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:13,880\nSo, Ronnie, a little knowledge check.\n\n1108\n01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,360\nWe've got two of these addresses.\n\n1109\n01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,850\nOne is familiar.\n\n1110\n01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:19,010\nThe other one is not.\n\n1111\n01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,850\nWhich one is this one?\n\n1112\n01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:24,779\nThe one beginning with\nFE80 is an IPv6 address.\n\n1113\n01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:26,630\nSweet.\n\n1114\n01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,460\nYeah.\nAll right, thank you Ronnie.\n\n1115\n01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,130\nAnd over here in the replication tab,\nright.\n\n1116\n01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:32,860\nWe don't have of this stuff, right.\n\n1117\n01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:36,320\nBut a bit more advanced\nthan what we're after.\n\n1118\n01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,320\nNow, one thing that we do have, so\nlet me just go back up here and\n\n1119\n01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,470\nclick on our domain controller.\n\n1120\n01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,265\nAnd let me float my mouse,\n\n1121\n01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:49,282\nwhich I was pretty sure that I could\nshrink that down, which it's not.\n\n1122\n01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:50,220\nThere you go.\n\n1123\n01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,638\nSo I could shrink that other one,\nI guess not.\n\n1124\n01:02:51,638 --> 01:02:52,850\nYeah not the one on bottom.\n\n1125\n01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:55,050\nSo here are some checkpoints.\n\n1126\n01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:59,520\nSo on this domain controller, we do make a\nlot of changes to this domain controller.\n\n1127\n01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,500\nSo we have the option to roll it back,\n\n1128\n01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:06,060\nwhich does introduce it's\nown problems with that.\n\n1129\n01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:09,780\nBut the way these checkpoints\nwork is that they're nested.\n\n1130\n01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:13,410\nSo we can have a checkpoint and\nhave that right there.\n\n1131\n01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:16,640\nThis one here was taken when\nit was first installed.\n\n1132\n01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,600\nSo we first installed it.\n\n1133\n01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,310\nWe took that checkpoint there.\n\n1134\n01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:24,207\nAnd as we turned it into a domain\ncontroller with the active directory,\n\n1135\n01:03:24,207 --> 01:03:26,830\nthen we can take that snapshot there.\n\n1136\n01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:29,650\nAnd another one,\nwhich who knows what that one made for.\n\n1137\n01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:33,070\nI think after it was,\nbefore it was all broken.\n\n1138\n01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:34,130\nAnd that one now based.\n\n1139\n01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:36,990\nSo whenever we revert anything,\n\n1140\n01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:40,060\nwe can go back to this checkpoint\nhere which is our base.\n\n1141\n01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:43,490\nSo everything is working for\nthe most part right there.\n\n1142\n01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,620\nSo we can delete checkpoints.\n\n1143\n01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,240\nWe can roll back the checkpoints.\n\n1144\n01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,060\nYeah.\n\n1145\n01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:52,950\nAnd let's say we could revert back\nto this checkpoint here and running.\n\n1146\n01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:57,680\nAnd if we wanted to create a checkpoint\nagain off of this configuration,\n\n1147\n01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,190\nthen it would continue the tree, and\n\n1148\n01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:04,220\nit would create another one down here,\nbypassing all this other stuff.\n\n1149\n01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,690\nSo, pretty fancy.\n\n1150\n01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,170\nPretty fancy stuff.\n\n1151\n01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:09,840\nYep.\n\n1152\n01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,510\nAnd we'll actually get into showing you\nhow all of that stuff really does work\n\n1153\n01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,120\nwhen we get into building\na virtual machine.\n\n1154\n01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,360\nAnd you'll see that there's more\ndetails there underneath what we'll see\n\n1155\n01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,980\non the actions as well.\n\n1156\n01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,820\nSo just because we show you\nthe overview of the Hyper-V manager and\n\n1157\n01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:27,200\nthe way that we can actually configure\na few things, we're by no means done yet.\n\n1158\n01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,060\nNext in our particular episode which\n\n1159\n01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:33,060\nwill be probably the next episode that\nwe'll do, we'll actually go ahead and\n\n1160\n01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,700\nbuild a virtual machine, and we'll\nbegin the configuration of it as well.\n\n1161\n01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,672\nSo we'll install and do everything.\n\n1162\n01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:43,810\nAll right Ronnie, that's sweet, so\nat that said we'll go ahead and\n\n1163\n01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,530\ncall it good right now.\n\n1164\n01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:49,980\nNow as always if you ever have any\nquestions during the show be sure to\n\n1165\n01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,520\njump in.\n\n1166\n01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,310\nRight beneath our live video, on the PC\nwe've got a little chat box down there,\n\n1167\n01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,270\nyou can type in a chat.\n\n1168\n01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,310\nWe've got a monitor up here,\nwe respond to it.\n\n1169\n01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:03,220\nIf you ever have any questions after the\nshow, you can jump into the Q&A section.\n\n1170\n01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:05,210\nJump into the forums in there,\ndrop us a line.\n\n1171\n01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:06,730\nWe monitor and get back to you.\n\n1172\n01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:10,330\nAnd if you're ever away from your PC,\nyou can always jump onto the Roku.\n\n1173\n01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:13,720\nWe've got a channel up there, you can\nsit in comfort of your own couch and\n\n1174\n01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,910\nwatch Ronnie up on your big screen TV or\nprojector.\n\n1175\n01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:17,440\nOh, dear.\n\n1176\n01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,060\nOr whatnot, so.\n\n1177\n01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,940\nAll right, well signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Nathan Copeland.\n\n1178\n01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:22,670\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n1179\n01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:24,550\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n1180\n01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:27,859\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:40,630\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,140\n>> How's it going Nate?\n\n5\n00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,510\n>> Pretty good Ronnie, how about you?\n\n6\n00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,200\n>> I'm doing well.\n\n7\n00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,680\nReady for another exciting episode in\nthe world of Hyper-V virtualization.\n\n8\n00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,320\nAnd so this is actually the second\nin our series here so far.\n\n9\n00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n10\n00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,510\nKind of dejavu.\n\n11\n00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,370\nIt kind of feels like\nwe've been here before.\n\n12\n00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,962\n>> It does.\n>> But we need to go deeper.\n\n13\n00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,150\n>> That's right.\n\n14\n00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,610\n>> Hyper-V, right?\n\n15\n00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,450\nSo we'll be creating some\nvirtual machines here.\n\n16\n00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,830\nAnd I really enjoy virtual machines.\n\n17\n00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,340\nI use them quite frequently\non this laptop here.\n\n18\n00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,820\nWe'll create some virtual machines.\n\n19\n00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,770\nYou know, I just spin one up and\njust mess around with it or\n\n20\n00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,190\ndo whatever I need to it.\n\n21\n00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,900\nThat way I can just delete it,\nor shut it down.\n\n22\n00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,730\nAnd not I guess jeopardize\nthe integrity of my daily driver.\n\n23\n00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,160\n>> Right.\n>> So I can still keep this one nice and\n\n24\n00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,540\nclean and pristine and spin up\na virtual machine to do whatever with.\n\n25\n00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,060\nAnd stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,512\n>> And stuff, yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:48,780\nAll right so in our particular\nsituation which we're going to do\n\n28\n00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,170\nsince we're gonna be spending our time in\nHyper-V, we're gonna create two different\n\n29\n00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,390\nvirtual machines is what we're gonna do,\nso you can see the process of both.\n\n30\n00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,370\nOne's gonna be just a basic\nVM that we're gonna do.\n\n31\n00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,940\nAnd we're gonna show you the way\nto make that start up and\n\n32\n00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,210\ndo everything that we need to.\n\n33\n00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,780\nSecond one's gonna be a basic VM but\n\n34\n00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,170\nthen we're gonna go back in and\nreconfigure it for some advanced options\n\n35\n00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,360\nto show you how powerful\nthe virtualization actually is for us.\n\n36\n00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,730\nAnd why we might need to do that as well.\n\n37\n00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,470\nSo, we're gonna actually do that.\n\n38\n00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,100\nOne on the client side, Hyper-V, and\nthen one on the server side, Hyper-V.\n\n39\n00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,810\nAnd so, Nate,\nwhere are we gonna start today?\n\n40\n00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,090\n>> I think we'll just start with\ncreating a basic virtual machine.\n\n41\n00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,980\n>> All right, sounds great.\n\n42\n00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,870\n>> So we'll do it on the client side,\n\n43\n00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,370\nand we'll just kinda just\nclick through the wizard.\n\n44\n00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,290\nAnd we'll make one up, and\ndo like you said, the advanced.\n\n45\n00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,750\nWell, maybe not advanced,\nmore customized one on the server.\n\n46\n00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,850\n>> Sounds great!\n\n47\n00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,490\n>> All right so\nkicking off on this machine here.\n\n48\n00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,770\nLet's jump into Hyper-V Manager.\n\n49\n00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,380\nAnd so I'll just type in Hyper-V and right\nthere at there very top Hyper-V Manager.\n\n50\n00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,330\nAnd there we go so\nnow it should be familiar to us now.\n\n51\n00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,699\nSo we kinda have an idea of where we need\nto go to click on things, to do stuff.\n\n52\n00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,360\nAnd so\nto get started over in our actions pane,\n\n53\n00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800\nwe will click on new cuz we want\nto create a new virtual machine.\n\n54\n00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,730\nAnd in our wizard here.\n\n55\n00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,140\nSo, this wizard helps you\ncreate a new virtual machine.\n\n56\n00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,715\nSweet.\nSo we are on the right track.\n\n57\n00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:18,560\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, we are.\n\n58\n00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,950\n>> We will click on next and now we\nneed to give our virtual machine a name.\n\n59\n00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,690\nNow, this isn't the computer name.\n\n60\n00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,400\nSo, after we've installed Windows or\nwhatever it is that we're going to install\n\n61\n00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,540\non here, we can't install certain\nLinux distros and other things.\n\n62\n00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,200\nSo this is just the name to identify\nthis machine inside Hyper-V manager.\n\n63\n00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,010\n>> Right.\n\n64\n00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,409\n>> So generally I like to name it\nsomething that is descriptive to\n\n65\n00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:49,128\nwhatever it is I'm installing on it.\n\n66\n00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:54,170\nSo this one we're just going to\ncall Windows 8.1 so Windows 8.1.\n\n67\n00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,795\n>> Okay, sounds good.\n\n68\n00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:59,550\n>> All right, now what we can do is store\nthe machine in a different location.\n\n69\n00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,979\nNow our default location down there\nin the gray is in ProgramData,\n\n70\n00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,045\nMicrosoft Windows Hyper-V.\n\n71\n00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:10,686\nThat ProgramData's a hidden folder, so\njust browse around in your hard drive,\n\n72\n00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,400\nyou will not see this folder.\n\n73\n00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,928\nWell, unless you choose\nshow hidden folders.\n\n74\n00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:18,700\nBut yeah, so\nkind of a buried location here.\n\n75\n00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,300\nSo for us, what I will do is I'll choose\nto store it in a different location.\n\n76\n00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,098\nMy favorite folder called Virtuals and\nwe'll just leave that Hyper-V,\n\n77\n00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:31,120\nthat works well.\n\n78\n00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,837\nAll right, and next.\n\n79\n00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:35,336\n>> Oh, a couple of options.\n\n80\n00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:36,200\n>> A couple of options here.\n\n81\n00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,730\nSo we have two different\ngenerations of machines.\n\n82\n00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,520\nGeneration 1, so\n\n83\n00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,390\nthis would be for our older operating\nsystems, those sorts of things.\n\n84\n00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,710\nGeneration 2 as a little wizard there says\nthat we have things like Secure Boot,\n\n85\n00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,870\nwhich Secure Boot, it, I guess,\nverifies that the boot process,\n\n86\n00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,850\nnothing has been tampered with and if it\nhas, then Windows will refuse to boot up.\n\n87\n00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,050\nIt will throw out an error.\n\n88\n00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,740\nWe have SCSI Boot, which is good and\n\n89\n00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,720\nthen PXE Booting using\na standard network adapter.\n\n90\n00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,780\nNow if we had a generation, well you\nknow what, should we create one of each?\n\n91\n00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,180\nGeneration 1 and Generation 2?\n\n92\n00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,130\n>> Sure why not.\n\n93\n00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:16,900\n>> Right?\n\n94\n00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,610\nOkay.\n\n95\n00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,770\nSo we'll do Windows 8.1,\nwe'll just use the same operating system.\n\n96\n00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,525\nOn this one,\nwe'll just do a standard Generation 1.\n\n97\n00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,090\nAnd click on,\nwell I guess to finish with that thought.\n\n98\n00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,620\n>> Yeah.\n\n99\n00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,620\n>> So with a Generation 1,\nif we want PXE boot a machine, so\n\n100\n00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,560\nif we want to boot this machine up and\ndiscover a.\n\n101\n00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,980\n>> Deployment server.\n\n102\n00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,100\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or a yep, PXE driver.\n\n103\n00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,260\n>> Good.\nYou wanna go ahead and\n\n104\n00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,840\nexplain PXE boot then?\n\n105\n00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,218\n>> Nope go ahead.\n\n106\n00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:49,700\n>> No, I'm okay so for it to discover\na deployment server out there that is\n\n107\n00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,900\nhosting an operating system,\nor an image of one.\n\n108\n00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,650\nThat it will automatically connect to that\ndeployment server and pull down an image.\n\n109\n00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,450\nAnd is install itself on there.\n\n110\n00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,140\nSo on a Generation 1,\nwe had to have legacy network adapter.\n\n111\n00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,370\nWhich we'll see when we get\ninto the virtual switches.\n\n112\n00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,740\nBut on the Generation 2, we don't need it.\n\n113\n00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,300\nWe can use the standard network adapter.\n\n114\n00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,550\nThe standard network adapters will have\nfaster speeds, better throughput or\n\n115\n00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,865\nlower latency than the legacy network\nadapters in the Generation 1.\n\n116\n00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,340\nSo, for us, we'll just choose\na Generation 1, click on next.\n\n117\n00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,900\nSo, now we get to specify how\nmuch memory this machine has.\n\n118\n00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,910\nNow it says startup memory,\nso how much memory,\n\n119\n00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,590\nit will grab initially as\nthis machine spins up.\n\n120\n00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,380\nIf we choose this option here,\nuse dynamic memory,\n\n121\n00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,260\nthe virtual machine it will\ncollect more RAM as it needs it.\n\n122\n00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,857\nSo if we're running some kind\nof tasks on it, it will call and\n\n123\n00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:56,295\nsay hey, I need additional RAM and\nit get it.\n\n124\n00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:59,820\nBut then when the machine idles down,\nit can release that RAM.\n\n125\n00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,550\nSo, if we do not choose this option\nthen whatever the startup memory is,\n\n126\n00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,660\nis what it's going to get.\n\n127\n00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,500\nNo more and no less.\n\n128\n00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,420\nWe choose dynamic memory,\nthen it can fluctuate, but\n\n129\n00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,570\nit will take this memory\ninitially as it spins up.\n\n130\n00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,700\nSo what we will do,\nwe will use dynamic memory for us.\n\n131\n00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,590\nAnd we will give this machine 2\nGB of memory for it to start up.\n\n132\n00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,840\n>> Very nice.\n>> Of course, after it's installed and\n\n133\n00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,730\nafter the guy idles up, or idles down?\n\n134\n00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,500\nIt should release some memory back.\n\n135\n00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,990\nAll right so here we get to\nchoose our network connection.\n\n136\n00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,640\nAll right now we don't have\nany virtual switches created.\n\n137\n00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,096\nNow, we will go through creating virtual\nswitches and network adapters, or\n\n138\n00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:50,153\nnot network adapters, just the virtual\nswitches on the server side.\n\n139\n00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:55,569\nAnd the reason being is On this PC here\nwe're doing the screen sharing software.\n\n140\n00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,987\nAnd if I create these virtual switches,\n\n141\n00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:01,390\nthen it's going to reconfigure\nthe network adapters.\n\n142\n00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,360\nIn the past,\nit has played havoc with our screen share.\n\n143\n00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,505\nSo we will cover this when\nwe get to the service side.\n\n144\n00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:14,480\nSo we won't connect it to any networks,\nand now we get into virtual hard disks.\n\n145\n00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,545\nNow virtual hard disks,\n\n146\n00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:20,250\nthere's a bit more configuration\nthan just this little menu here.\n\n147\n00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,520\nWe can create a basic one,\nright here on a VHDX format,\n\n148\n00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,010\nin this location with this size.\n\n149\n00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,350\nIf we had an existing virtual hard drive,\n\n150\n00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,500\nlet's say we had to destroy the VM for\nsome reason.\n\n151\n00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,930\nAnd we're creating a new VM, and we\nwanted to use an older hard drive, right?\n\n152\n00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,990\nWe can choose that option there, but what\nwe will do is choose to attach one later.\n\n153\n00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,260\nAnd then our little screen here.\n\n154\n00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,130\nAnd we'll click on finish, all right.\n\n155\n00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,940\nThere we go.\n\n156\n00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,050\nSo there's our virtual machine.\n\n157\n00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,010\n>> Yeah.\n\n158\n00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,621\nYeah, on the basic VM, right, what we're\ndoing is we're simply walking through\n\n159\n00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:06,520\nthe menu a lot of times and\njust selecting the most basic function.\n\n160\n00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,300\nNow, Nate went even more basic than that,\nbecause we wanted to show you each and\n\n161\n00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,810\nevery one of those details.\n\n162\n00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,270\nWhat you can do to actually,\n\n163\n00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,270\nagain, choose what you'd rather do\ninstead of just accepting the defaults.\n\n164\n00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,142\nSo right now, we've got a virtual machine,\nNate, with no hard hard drive.\n\n165\n00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n166\n00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,110\n>> With some Ram assigned, but\n\n167\n00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,610\nno operating system actually\ninstalled on there.\n\n168\n00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,580\nSo we have a listing of a virtual machine,\nbut really nothing on it.\n\n169\n00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,380\nSo, what's our next step, Nate?\n\n170\n00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,140\n>> Our next step here,\n\n171\n00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,060\nright now, I believe what we can do is\ncreate that virtual hard drive, and\n\n172\n00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,650\nassign this virtual hard drive to this PC,\nand begin installing an operating system.\n\n173\n00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,182\n>> Sounds good.\n\n174\n00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:43,921\n>> All right.\n\n175\n00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:48,453\nBut I think, Ronnie, before we do that,\nlet's quickly we'll run through this, and\n\n176\n00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,760\nlet's create that Generation 2 machine.\n\n177\n00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,060\n>> All right, let's do it.\n\n178\n00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,660\n>> All right, so\nthis menu we've seen this before.\n\n179\n00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,550\nWe'll just create that.\n\n180\n00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,250\nSo we'll call this one 181GEN2.\n\n181\n00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,120\nWe will store it in a different location.\n\n182\n00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,376\nAnd we'll choose to store\nthis our our Virtuals.\n\n183\n00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:15,110\nHyper-V folder, and Next.\n\n184\n00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,550\nThis will be a Generation 2.\n\n185\n00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,110\nNow, in Generation 2, as we can\nsee here at the bottom, the guest\n\n186\n00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,850\noperating system, whatever is going to\nbe installed on this virtual machine\n\n187\n00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,490\nneeds to be either Windows Server 2012,\nor Windows 8, or higher.\n\n188\n00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,796\nSo we're going to throw on 8.1,\nwhich works.\n\n189\n00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:41,356\nAnd if we're going to do Windows Server\n2012 R2, that would work too.\n\n190\n00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:44,630\nSo if we were installing\na Windows 7 machine,\n\n191\n00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,750\nRonnie, which one would we have to choose?\n\n192\n00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,180\n>> You would have to choose Generation 1.\n\n193\n00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,680\n>> Correct.\n>> Yes.\n\n194\n00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,130\n>> What about if we were doing Windows XP?\n\n195\n00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,930\n>> You'd have to choose Generation 1.\n\n196\n00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,880\n>> What if we were doing Windows ME?\n\n197\n00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,921\n>> Generation 1.\n\n198\n00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:58,050\n>> [LAUGH] All right, perfect.\n\n199\n00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,430\n>> That's pretty much with Java.\n\n200\n00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,100\nYou've got to be careful here, because it\nsays once you've actually created this and\n\n201\n00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100\nwhatever generation,\nit's going to remain that.\n\n202\n00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,950\nSo if you mess up here and it doesn't work\nhere, you can actually have some problems.\n\n203\n00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,660\nSo make sure you choose the right one,\nyeah.\n\n204\n00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,290\n>> Yeah, well and you know, if you wanted\nto change it, I mean you could wipe out\n\n205\n00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,410\nthe virtual machine, create a new\none with the new generation, and\n\n206\n00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,430\nthen just attach that existing hard drive.\n\n207\n00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,960\n>> Yeah, but\nwe don't have a hard drive yet.\n\n208\n00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,680\n>> Not yet.\n>> Yeah, so there we go.\n\n209\n00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,530\n>> So we will choose that Generation 2.\n\n210\n00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,171\n>> And for the memory,\nwe will let it take 2 gig.\n\n211\n00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:30,963\nOops.\n>> Oh.\n\n212\n00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:33,838\n>> Whoa.\n\n213\n00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:39,210\nWe'll let it take 2 gigs, and we will\nchoose dynamic memory, and no networking.\n\n214\n00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,930\nWe will choose to attach\na hard disk later.\n\n215\n00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,340\nAnd there's a little screen.\n\n216\n00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,290\n>> A summary, yep.\n\n217\n00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,240\n>> Summary screen, thank you.\n\n218\n00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,060\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n219\n00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,220\nNow we have our two virtual machines,\nand again, these are just empty shells.\n\n220\n00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,213\nThere's nothing to them.\n\n221\n00:11:56,213 --> 00:12:01,940\nAll right, so over in our Actions pane,\nclick on New and a Hard Disk.\n\n222\n00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,720\nSo we've gotta give it a hard drive.\n\n223\n00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,280\n>> All right.\n>> And a little screen where it says\n\n224\n00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,160\ncreate a virtual hard disc.\n\n225\n00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,213\nNice.\n\n226\n00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:09,790\nAll right.\n>> There you go.\n\n227\n00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,640\n>> So we have two options here.\n\n228\n00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:19,530\nWe can create a VHD, a hard disc with\na VHD extension or a VHDX extension.\n\n229\n00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,180\nAs the wizard points, here,\nthere a some benefits going to a VHDX.\n\n230\n00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:31,830\nVHD is a little bit more compatible\nwith the other virtualization platforms.\n\n231\n00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:38,180\nSo if we wanna take a VHD and convert it\nover to like a virtual box or something.\n\n232\n00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,005\nWe could.\n\n233\n00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:45,310\nAnd so here [INAUDIBLE] supports\nvirtualization up to 64 terabytes.\n\n234\n00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,280\n>> That's pretty big.\n\n235\n00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,820\n>> That is pretty big.\n\n236\n00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,730\nRonnie, what kind of machine would you use\nthat would need 64 terabytes of space.\n\n237\n00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,380\n>> My laptop.\n\n238\n00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, I'm joking.\n\n239\n00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,380\nNormally this would be, of course,\n\n240\n00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,180\nservers that you would find in\ndata centers of anything else.\n\n241\n00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,420\nBig gigantic SQL databases, perhaps.\n\n242\n00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,960\n>> And a little side note there,\nat very end it says that\n\n243\n00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,640\nthis format has not operating\nsystems earlier than windows 8.\n\n244\n00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,980\n>> Well, that's gotta give us a hint,\nright, that if anything else,\n\n245\n00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,467\nwe're gonna be using regular VHDs instead.\n\n246\n00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,340\n>> Yep.\nSo if we're installing Windows 98 Ronnie?\n\n247\n00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,895\n>> Yeah, once again, you'd use the VHD.\n\n248\n00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:20,838\n>> Right on.\n\n249\n00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:21,546\n>> Yeah.\n\n250\n00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:25,463\n>> All right.\nSo for this one, we'll just choose VHDX.\n\n251\n00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:27,980\nFor ours, we'll just go in and\naccept that default.\n\n252\n00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,550\nNow there are three types of virtual\nhard drives that we can create.\n\n253\n00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,652\nWe have a fixed size hard drive.\n\n254\n00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:40,910\nNow a fixed size will allocate all the\nspace that we assigned to that hard drive.\n\n255\n00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,005\nAnd just rake it up all at one time.\n\n256\n00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:48,630\nSo let's say if you have\na 30 gigabyte hard drive.\n\n257\n00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,073\nWell, that 30 gigabyte virtual hard drive,\n\n258\n00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:57,625\nit's file size on this post operating\nsystem is going to be 30 gigabytes.\n\n259\n00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,726\n>> That's it.\n>> It's going to allocate all of that\n\n260\n00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:02,040\nspace is going to take it all.\n\n261\n00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,545\nNow a fixed sized hard disk is great for\nperformance.\n\n262\n00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:08,430\nIt doesn't have to grow,\nit doesn't have to do anything.\n\n263\n00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,490\nIt already has all that size,\nso great for production.\n\n264\n00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,500\nAnd generally, if you're going to be\nhaving a virtual machine that you're going\n\n265\n00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,860\nto keep for a while, fixed size.\n\n266\n00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,380\nYou'll get better performance out of it.\n\n267\n00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,220\nThe next type is dynamically expanding.\n\n268\n00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,670\nNow this hard drive will only\ntake enough space that it needs.\n\n269\n00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,959\nSo if we build that same 30\ngigabyte hard drive, the file size\n\n270\n00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:39,830\nto the post operating system, it's\ngoing to start out at a few hundred k.\n\n271\n00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,760\nMaybe a megabyte.\n\n272\n00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,790\nAs we install Windows, or\ninstall anything on that hard drive,\n\n273\n00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,480\nit will slowly grow up to\nthe maximum that we assign.\n\n274\n00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,670\nWhich, in this example,\nwould be 30 gigabytes.\n\n275\n00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:59,320\nSo it dynamically expanding, it will grow\nas we write more stuff to that hard drive.\n\n276\n00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,610\nFor testing and stuff, you know we\ncan create a 60 gigabyte hard drive.\n\n277\n00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,410\nAnd then,\njust let it kind of grow up as it goes.\n\n278\n00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,520\nGreat for testing, and\nthose sort of things.\n\n279\n00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,335\nNow the third option we have\nis a differencing disk.\n\n280\n00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:17,900\nRonnie, you want to take differencing?\n\n281\n00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,430\n>> Yeah, the idea of differencing disk for\nus is that what we can do is go ahead and\n\n282\n00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,570\ninstall our operating system on it.\n\n283\n00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,320\nAnd essentially keep that disk pretty\nmuch pristine is what we want.\n\n284\n00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,874\nAll of the changes that we would make,\nsuch as adding in new roles, new features,\n\n285\n00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:37,505\neven the idea of applications, right,\nwould be installed on another hard drive.\n\n286\n00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:40,618\nSo that way if we ever want to\nroll back to a previous state,\n\n287\n00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:43,941\nhere, we can actually use\na differencing disk to help us out.\n\n288\n00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:47,003\nSo this means changes are never\nmade to the initial hard drive.\n\n289\n00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:50,475\nThey're only made to this differencing\ndisk, and that way can back it up and\n\n290\n00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:52,930\nchange things that we want to very easily.\n\n291\n00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:58,280\n>> You know Ernie when we get on\nto the server one, let's do that.\n\n292\n00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,910\nLet's create a parent hard drive.\n\n293\n00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,810\nAnd then we'll create some\ndifferencing disks off of that.\n\n294\n00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,160\n>> Sounds good.\n\n295\n00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,460\n>> All right.\n\n296\n00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,360\nSo and this one here, so we will\njust do a dynamically expanding one.\n\n297\n00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,300\nCuz there's on the SSD, I've got some\nspace onto it, we got quite a bit, right.\n\n298\n00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,180\nSo 48, 47 free here,\n50, 40, 45 free there.\n\n299\n00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,610\nBut we won't go and rank all that data.\n\n300\n00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,930\nSo.\nLet's go over here.\n\n301\n00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,410\n>> Two for testing, yeah.\n\n302\n00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,830\n>> So for this one here we will\nchoose dynamically expanding.\n\n303\n00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,740\n>> Sounds good.\n\n304\n00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,910\nAll right,\nnow we need to name this hard drive.\n\n305\n00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,160\nAnd just like the virtual machines,\n\n306\n00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,990\nI like to name it, I guess name it\nwhatever machine it's gonna go in.\n\n307\n00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,080\n>> Sure that sounds good.\n\n308\n00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,994\n>> So we'll just call this one 181.\n\n309\n00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,090\nAnd for the location, all right so,\nlet's choose a different location.\n\n310\n00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,160\nExpand that out and go down.\n\n311\n00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,880\nSo we go into the C drive, and\nVirtuals Hyper V, but we'll do virtuals.\n\n312\n00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,070\nAnd let's create a new folder.\n\n313\n00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,880\nWe'll call this one VMs.\n\n314\n00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,740\nSelect folder.\n\n315\n00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,230\nAlright, so it's going to go and and\nvirtuals and VMs and Ronnie at this point\n\n316\n00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,245\nI think we could probably change the\ndefaults if we keep creating these VMs.\n\n317\n00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:25,110\n[LAUGH] Right, and\nwe'll click on Next here.\n\n318\n00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,970\nAll right, so now this is the maximum\nsize of that hard drive, so\n\n319\n00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,530\nhow big we wanna take it.\n\n320\n00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,290\nWe could, since it is dynamically\nexpanding, we could really pick whatever\n\n321\n00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,275\nsize we wanted, as long as it was\nenough to install Windows too.\n\n322\n00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:39,775\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n323\n00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,050\n>> So I think we're just going to\nchoose 60 gigabytes, should be plenty.\n\n324\n00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,440\nNow, what we could do then is copy\nthe contents of a specified physical disc.\n\n325\n00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,990\nSo, if we're going to be doing\na physical to virtual migration.\n\n326\n00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:02,450\nLet's say we had that Windows XP machine\nand we didn't want to decommission it but\n\n327\n00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,720\nit's on older hardware, maybe it's taking\nup space and power, creating heat.\n\n328\n00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,386\nAnd so we wanted to convert that machine\nto physical, stick it on some file server\n\n329\n00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:16,150\nsomewhere and didn't want to have to\nreally maintain it at that point.\n\n330\n00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,500\nThen we could really import that physical\ndisk in here, we can go that route.\n\n331\n00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,440\nOr we could copy\nthe contents of another DHD.\n\n332\n00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,390\nNow, once we get into the server and\n\n333\n00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,640\ntake a look at some of the more advanced\nstuff there, there is disk pass through.\n\n334\n00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,020\nSo we could assign a virtual disk\nstraight to its own hard drive, and\n\n335\n00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,070\nso we could do that as well, but we'll get\ninto that a little bit later all right so\n\n336\n00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,770\nwe'll just create a 60 gigabyte VHD.\n\n337\n00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,960\nAnd here's our summary screen, cool.\n\n338\n00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,790\nClick on finish.\n\n339\n00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,410\nThere we go.\n\n340\n00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,240\n>> All right it doesn't\nlook any different Nate.\n\n341\n00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,470\nNot impressive.\n\n342\n00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,355\n>> It sure doesn't, Ronnie.\n\n343\n00:18:57,355 --> 00:18:58,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n344\n00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,300\nat this point we create\na virtual hard drive.\n\n345\n00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,970\nYou know, let's go take a look at it.\n\n346\n00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,060\nOn here and where did we put it in Ronnie?\n\n347\n00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,540\nI'll check.\n>> The virtuals folder.\n\n348\n00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,980\n>> And oh, I stuck it in VMs by,\nI'm gonna call it VHDs.\n\n349\n00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,530\nOops, I'll rename it later.\n\n350\n00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,840\nAll right, so we see, so\nit was a 30 gigabyte hard drive.\n\n351\n00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,890\nBut how big is it, what, four megs?\n\n352\n00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,770\n>> Yeah, so far.\n\n353\n00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,560\n>> Yeah, four megs, not very big\nto be a 60 gigabyte Hard drive.\n\n354\n00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,294\nNow, if we created a fixed-size hard\ndrive, then how big would it be?\n\n355\n00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:35,575\n>> It would be the 60 GB hard drive.\n\n356\n00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,467\n>> 60 gigs.\nI don't have 60GB of free space.\n\n357\n00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,715\n>> Oh, then you'd better not do it.\n\n358\n00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:42,895\n>> Now that we've created\nthis virtual hard drive,\n\n359\n00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:48,175\nlet's go ahead and spin up another one for\nour other virtual machine.\n\n360\n00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:52,557\nNext, we'll create a VHDX as\nwell down at the expanding and\n\n361\n00:19:52,557 --> 00:20:00,420\nwe're gonna call this one 181gen2.\n\n362\n00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:07,500\nAnd once again we'll stick\nit in C drive virtual vans.\n\n363\n00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,340\nSelect folder, all right, there we go.\n\n364\n00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,380\nAnd next, this one we will also\ncreate a 60 gigabyte hard drive.\n\n365\n00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,070\nAnd your summary screen finish.\n\n366\n00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,290\nAll right, and then once again if we jump\nback over here we can see now another one,\n\n367\n00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,010\nhard drive here, and it's only four megs.\n\n368\n00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n369\n00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,540\n>> All right.\n\n370\n00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,920\nSo now what we need to do is,\njust like in a physical machine,\n\n371\n00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,510\nwe have to take this virtual\nhard drive and put it in our PC.\n\n372\n00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,540\nSo we'll click on one of\nour VMs to get it focused.\n\n373\n00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,250\nWe will right click and\nchoose settings for this virtual machine.\n\n374\n00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,300\nAnd in here, we have some setting.\n\n375\n00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,590\nNow Ronnie, we haven't really gotten\ninto any of these settings yet.\n\n376\n00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,410\n>> No.\n>> So.\n\n377\n00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,380\nWhat do you think?\n\n378\n00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,580\nShould we address it now, right?\n\n379\n00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,120\n>> Yeah, let's do it.\n\n380\n00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,830\n>> All right.\n\n381\n00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n382\n00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,620\nup here at the very top\nwe have add a hardware.\n\n383\n00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,580\nSo with this highlighted over here in\nthis other pane, we have the different\n\n384\n00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,210\nhardware, virtual hardware-\n>> Right.\n\n385\n00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,620\n>> That we can assign our virtual machine.\n\n386\n00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,840\nWe can give it a scuzzy controller and\n\n387\n00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,935\nRonnie, do you want to explain\nthe scuzzy controllers?\n\n388\n00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:20,250\n>> [LAUGH] In terms of the hardware right,\n\n389\n00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,840\nwhat have we really created in\nterms of a virtual machine?\n\n390\n00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,970\nWe have now actually,\n\n391\n00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,060\nessentially told the HyperV manager right\nthat we're gonna emulate this hardware.\n\n392\n00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,950\nWe are going to actually have\nthis hardware in front of us and\n\n393\n00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,978\nwhen we load an operating system\nthis is what we want to discover.\n\n394\n00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:38,450\nSo what yo're doing here is your really\nconfiguring the actual virtual machine\n\n395\n00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,920\nitself in terms of what\nthe hardware we want.\n\n396\n00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,920\nSo if you did have the idea of a scuzzy\ncontroller to build an add-in,\n\n397\n00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,440\nmaybe a RAID controller or something like\nthat where you wanted to span the drives,\n\n398\n00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,380\nyou can actually do that here.\n\n399\n00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,230\nSo that's what the scuzzy\ncontroller's doing,\n\n400\n00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,485\nit's allowing us to see multiple\nhard drives at the same time.\n\n401\n00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:56,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Did you like that hand off?\n\n402\n00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,400\n>> Yeah, I loved it.\n\n403\n00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,040\n>> Here you go, Ronnie.\n\n404\n00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,780\nTake this on.\n\n405\n00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,470\n>> Here you go.\nHave fun.\n\n406\n00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,200\n>> All right.\n\n407\n00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,180\nNetwork adapter, so\n\n408\n00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,240\nthis is our standard network adapter that\nwe can add into our virtual machine.\n\n409\n00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,980\nWe can have many.\n\n410\n00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,270\n>> Virtual network adapters.\n\n411\n00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,490\n>> Yeah and you see right here, that\nit's already got a network adapter, but\n\n412\n00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,880\nit's just not connected.\n\n413\n00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,450\nSo, we wanted to do multiple network\nadapters, we would add that in and\n\n414\n00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,930\nwe are going to do that\na little bit later, but for\n\n415\n00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,360\nright now,\nthere is already one attached here for us.\n\n416\n00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,600\n>> You know what, Ronnie?\n\n417\n00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,390\nActually, as a matter of face,\ncome to think of it.\n\n418\n00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,020\nWe should go through all these\nsettings when we create.\n\n419\n00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,160\nCreate our customized VM.\n\n420\n00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,630\n>> Okay.\nAll right, that sounds good.\n\n421\n00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,620\n>> Let's do that.\nSo for this one, we'll do that.\n\n422\n00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,780\nWhen we get over to the server one.\n\n423\n00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,580\n>> Let's go ahead and\n\n424\n00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,200\npoint out some of the basic\nhardware that we have here, right?\n\n425\n00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,420\nAgain, regular buyoffs is what we have.\n\n426\n00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,675\nWe can see the actual memory.\n\n427\n00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,455\nThat we've assigned here, okay?\n\n428\n00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:46,985\nSo notice that we can change that\neven though Nate already did that in\n\n429\n00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:51,385\nthe wizard, but notice that you actually\ndo have all these different things, and\n\n430\n00:22:51,385 --> 00:22:54,435\nagain, we'll kind of hit that\na little bit harder next time.\n\n431\n00:22:54,435 --> 00:22:56,952\nGo to the processor as well and\n\n432\n00:22:56,952 --> 00:22:58,992\nyou can see that we can\nactually change the processor.\n\n433\n00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:01,752\nWell we're gonna talk about that, but\nnotice that what we're talking about here,\n\n434\n00:23:01,752 --> 00:23:03,102\nright, is essentially hardware.\n\n435\n00:23:03,102 --> 00:23:04,752\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n436\n00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:08,160\nWe're taking a look at what we really\nneed to get this machine started.\n\n437\n00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,900\nIf this actually meets\nthe requirements that we want for\n\n438\n00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,360\nour machine,\nthen we're ready to go at this point here.\n\n439\n00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,140\nSo we're going to get deeper into this\nonce we get over onto the server.\n\n440\n00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,920\nSo scroll down a little bit toward\nthe bottom, toward management here.\n\n441\n00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,580\nNotice you can even put in\na A diskette drive, if you want to.\n\n442\n00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,620\nIf you needed to boot off of a diskette.\n\n443\n00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,990\nAnd so you see a lot of\nthe different management features.\n\n444\n00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,200\nAnd again, more stuff that we'll see\nin the advanced install that we'll do.\n\n445\n00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,795\nAll right?\n\n446\n00:23:34,795 --> 00:23:36,240\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n447\n00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,770\n>> All right.\nSo for that hard drive, right?\n\n448\n00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,650\nSo we are going to put it\nonto our IDE controller.\n\n449\n00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,450\nAnd so what we'll do is we'll highlight\nthis ID controller one of these ID\n\n450\n00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,858\ncontrollers We can have two devices,\nright.\n\n451\n00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:52,960\nJust like a physical PC, right.\n\n452\n00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,100\nSo you know those older PC's, and\nnot many people have IDE ports, slots.\n\n453\n00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,260\nThey're called PATA now, right?\n\n454\n00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,205\nParallel ATA's.\n\n455\n00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:07,465\nBut each header could support two devices.\n\n456\n00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:09,320\n>> Max.\n>> Right, max.\n\n457\n00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,800\nAnd the same is true for\nthis virtual machine.\n\n458\n00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,730\nWe can have max two devices\non each one of these.\n\n459\n00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,930\nSo, we have to ID controllers.\n\n460\n00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,990\nWe could have a max of four devices,\nfour virtual devices,\n\n461\n00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,500\nconnected to these, mixture between\nhard drives and DVD drives.\n\n462\n00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,720\nSo, we'll just choose\ngood old controller one.\n\n463\n00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,640\nAnd a hard drive.\n\n464\n00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,692\nWe'll click on add.\n\n465\n00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:36,560\nAll right, so it's going to be on ID\ncontroller one, location one, sure.\n\n466\n00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,912\nI guess one would be the slave, I guess.\n\n467\n00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:42,402\nAll right, and so for the media,\nso what we're going to put in,\n\n468\n00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:47,490\nwe could click on new to create that new,\ncreate a new hard drive.\n\n469\n00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,175\nSince we have one,\nwe will click on browse.\n\n470\n00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:57,570\n[LAUGH] You know I think we'll change\nthat default folder here in a minute.\n\n471\n00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,960\nAnd virtual VMs even though it's a VHD.\n\n472\n00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,090\nThat guy there, open.\n\n473\n00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,220\nSo that is our virtual hard drive\nthat we're going to use for\n\n474\n00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,220\nthis virtual machine.\n\n475\n00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,440\nWe'll click on apply.\n\n476\n00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,130\nWe can apply these changes.\n\n477\n00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,430\nAnd now we can click okay.\n\n478\n00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:20,360\nHowever, we still need to have some kind\nof operating system onto this drive.\n\n479\n00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,019\n>> All right.\n\n480\n00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,405\nSo Nate, is there a reason why you chose\ncontroller one over controller zero?\n\n481\n00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:25,857\n>> No\n>> Okay, just didn't know.\n\n482\n00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:30,401\n>> All right, just no reason in\nparticular, I guess we could but,\n\n483\n00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:32,181\nyeah, just picked one.\n\n484\n00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:35,647\n>> All right\n>> All right, so to get an operating\n\n485\n00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:41,560\nsystem on to this drive we'll,\nwhat would you do in a physical PC?\n\n486\n00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,270\nWell, you've got your\nlittle installation media.\n\n487\n00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,266\nAnd you gotta stick it in\nthe DVD drive and boot the PC.\n\n488\n00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:51,770\nAll right, so you see on our BIOS\nsettings its already configured to\n\n489\n00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,180\nboot from the CD first right.\n\n490\n00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,580\nSo that's fine that's what we're after so\n\n491\n00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,970\nwhat we need to do is put\nin a CD in our DVD drive.\n\n492\n00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,260\nSo then click on our DVD drive, and\n\n493\n00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,590\nnow the best thing to do with a virtual\nmachine is to insert a virtual CD.\n\n494\n00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,100\n>> That's right.\n\n495\n00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,270\n>> How did you like that, Ronnie?\n\n496\n00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,710\n>> I loved it.\n\n497\n00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,960\n>> All right, and for our virtual CDs\nright, they're in the ISO extension.\n\n498\n00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,950\nRonnie, do you know what ISO stands for?\n\n499\n00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,570\n>> International Standards Organization.\n\n500\n00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,480\n>> And it actually stands for equal.\n\n501\n00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,910\n>> Right.\n\n502\n00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,710\nSo it's the CD dot equal?\n\n503\n00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,900\n>> Yeah,\nit's just the standardized format.\n\n504\n00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,350\n>> Okay, cool.\n\n505\n00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,157\nAll right, so.\n\n506\n00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is.\n\n507\n00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,280\n>> All right, right on.\n\n508\n00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,270\nI didn't know you knew the answers,\nthat's funny.\n\n509\n00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,590\n>> Well, okay, thank you.\n\n510\n00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,530\n>> I don't mean to, you know,\nthrow you under the bus, so that's funny.\n\n511\n00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,120\n>> All right.\n\n512\n00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,620\n>> Yeah.\n>> Excellent.\n\n513\n00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,000\n>> Well, there you go, ISO.\n\n514\n00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,560\n>> Yeah, ISO.\n\n515\n00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:51,790\n>> All right, so we'll go ahead and on\nthe desktop on this PC I do have an ISO.\n\n516\n00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,330\nLet's click here.\n\n517\n00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,734\nWe've got this guy right here Is\na Windows 8.1 evaluation copy.\n\n518\n00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:03,220\nSo we'll just throw an eval cause we don't\nneed a product key during installation.\n\n519\n00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,750\n>> Yeah.\n\n520\n00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,500\n>> So it will work great for us.\n\n521\n00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,040\n>> That's a good reminder now to remember\nthat you can actually go to Microsoft and\n\n522\n00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,690\nbe able to download some of these\neval copies that will be available\n\n523\n00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,660\nfor you as well.\n\n524\n00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,700\nSo you don't have one,\nhere's one that you can do, to practice.\n\n525\n00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:21,940\n>> All right, so before that image file,\nwe will click on browse.\n\n526\n00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,510\nAnd for the image file,\nwe need that virtual CD, or\n\n527\n00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,425\nin this case it would be a DVD, since CDs\nare only what like seven hundred megs?\n\n528\n00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:30,011\n>> Sure.\n\n529\n00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:31,624\nSounds great.\n\n530\n00:27:31,624 --> 00:27:35,870\n>> Let's go to desktop,\nand there is our eval ISO.\n\n531\n00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,900\nOpen, so there we go.\n\n532\n00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:43,990\nNow it's loaded in our virtual DVD drive,\napply, okay.\n\n533\n00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,530\nLet's get back in here.\n\n534\n00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,530\nAll right.\n\n535\n00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,610\nSo now we've attached our hard drive.\n\n536\n00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,660\nWe've got our installation DVD inside.\n\n537\n00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,650\nSo now what's next?\n\n538\n00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,870\n>> Now we have to actually go ahead and\n\n539\n00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,910\ndo what we'd normally do on a regular\nphysical machine, is reboot the thing.\n\n540\n00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,408\nBut ours is actually off, so\nwe just need to turn to it on.\n\n541\n00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,272\n>> All right.\n\n542\n00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:05,870\nNow to turn this on right,\nI mean there's no power button.\n\n543\n00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,830\n>> What? [LAUGH] >> But\nif we click on our virtual machine here.\n\n544\n00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,110\nAnd we right click.\n\n545\n00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,680\nWe have the connect.\n\n546\n00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,950\nNow connect will open up a console window,\nor it will open up a little window here.\n\n547\n00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,000\nOr we can just choose to straight\nup start the machine without\n\n548\n00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,810\nreally connecting to it.\n\n549\n00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,740\nAnd of course checkpoint, moves, and\n\n550\n00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,550\nrenames we can get all that\nstuff in the service side.\n\n551\n00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,380\nBut what I will do is I will right\nclick and I will choose connect.\n\n552\n00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,270\nSo here we go, and right here in\nthis window in our virtual machine.\n\n553\n00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,450\nRight here, right there in the middle,\nit is now turned off.\n\n554\n00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,320\n>> All right\n>> So over here in this button over here,\n\n555\n00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,958\nthis green button.\n\n556\n00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,130\n>> Looks like a power button.\n\n557\n00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:45,769\n>> Start.\nSo\n\n558\n00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:50,200\nI'll click that button to\nstart our virtual machine.\n\n559\n00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,370\nAnd as it spins up, now anybody\nwho's installed Windows 8.1 before,\n\n560\n00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,935\nthis should be a very familiar process.\n\n561\n00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And as this guy starts going,\n\n562\n00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,780\nif we go back into our Hyper V manager,\nour little thumbnail, it takes a second or\n\n563\n00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,490\ntwo, but it will update and\n\n564\n00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,450\nit will you know show a live preview\nof what our virtual machine is doing.\n\n565\n00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,130\nSo if we have many virtual machines we\ncould quickly click through and get a.\n\n566\n00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,150\nIs a quick little miniature\nstatus on what's going on.\n\n567\n00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,720\n>> It looks like it's ready for\nyou to enter some information.\n\n568\n00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,360\n>> It sure does.\n\n569\n00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,820\nSo I'll just click on Next.\n\n570\n00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,560\nInstall.\n\n571\n00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:34,072\nAnd as the install process starts up and\ngets going.\n\n572\n00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:39,482\nYou know, and while this is doing that\nstuff, let's jump over to our Gen2 and\n\n573\n00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:44,060\nthen we'll quickly go ahead and, oh yeah,\nthis one will be a bit different.\n\n574\n00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,230\nSee I have no IDE controllers on this one.\n\n575\n00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,990\nI just have SCSI controllers.\n\n576\n00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,520\nNow of course with the Gen2, what it\nsaid earlier is that it can boot up from\n\n577\n00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,820\nthe SCSI controller, so that works well.\n\n578\n00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:00,660\nAll right, we can also boot from\nthat network adapter if we wanted to\n\n579\n00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,960\npixy boot and grab that image\nfrom the deployment server.\n\n580\n00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,750\nWe can do that.\nWe see secure boot is enabled.\n\n581\n00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,419\nAwesome.\nSo on the SCSI controller,\n\n582\n00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:13,250\nwe'll quickly add a hard drive.\n\n583\n00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,306\nAnd with that virtual hard disk,\nwe won't create a new one but\n\n584\n00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:19,882\nwe'll just browse to an existing one.\n\n585\n00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:29,840\nThere's the Gen 2.\n\n586\n00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,740\nApply.\n\n587\n00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,030\nAnd on this one, as well.\n\n588\n00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,450\nWe will need to add a DVD drive.\n\n589\n00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,210\nAnd on that DVD drive,\nwe'll click on the image file.\n\n590\n00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,040\nAnd we'll go and we'll find our ISO.\n\n591\n00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,530\nOpen, apply and okay.\n\n592\n00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,230\nNow but we won't spin to Skype right now.\n\n593\n00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,035\nI don't want to bog down\nmy machine too much.\n\n594\n00:30:55,035 --> 00:30:57,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Here we go,\n\n595\n00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,560\nwe'll just click through and then custom.\n\n596\n00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,625\nI will click through this part right\nhere since we're just focusing on\n\n597\n00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:03,430\nHyperV at this point.\n\n598\n00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,920\n>> Yep, so the install is going to go in\nthe regular install than normal, here.\n\n599\n00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,150\nAnd notice that it's treating it as if\nit's actually in it's own, physical,\n\n600\n00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,340\nPC, right?\n\n601\n00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:13,943\nSo at this point,\n\n602\n00:31:13,943 --> 00:31:17,165\nWindows 8.1 really doesn't know that\nit's actually in a virtual environment.\n\n603\n00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:18,385\nIt believes it's seeing the hardware.\n\n604\n00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:19,725\nIt believes it's doing everything.\n\n605\n00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:22,575\nSo the Hyper bios are actually\nworking the way that it needs to and\n\n606\n00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:25,545\nthis gives us this ability to again,\nrun this.\n\n607\n00:31:25,545 --> 00:31:29,423\nSo in the background, Nate is still\nrunning Windows 8.1 and on his machine.\n\n608\n00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:33,862\nHe's installing 8.1 in this\nvirtualized environment.\n\n609\n00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:38,612\nAnd once everything is ready to go, we'll\nboot up and watch him build and use it.\n\n610\n00:31:38,612 --> 00:31:39,542\nJust like normal here.\n\n611\n00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:43,673\nSame thing would be true about\nthe second generation VHD as well.\n\n612\n00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:46,522\n>> All right Ronnie, we are,\nappear, on break time.\n\n613\n00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:50,217\nSo let's do this, we'll take a break,\nwe'll let this VM sit here and install.\n\n614\n00:31:50,217 --> 00:31:53,460\nWhen we come back, it should be close or\npretty close to being done.\n\n615\n00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,840\n>> Right.\n>> And we can go that route.\n\n616\n00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,891\nSound good?\n\n617\n00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,146\n>> Yep.\n>> All right,\n\n618\n00:31:58,146 --> 00:32:01,802\nwe'll get this VM after the break.\n\n619\n00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:06,402\n[SOUND].\n\n620\n00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:07,110\nAll right.\n\n621\n00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,430\nWelcome back.\n\n622\n00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,450\nSo that virtual machine\nit did finish installing.\n\n623\n00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:16,380\nSo now that that virtual machine is up and\ngoing, I guess, let's take a look at it?\n\n624\n00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,310\n>> Yep.\n>> Let's see if it actually works.\n\n625\n00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,950\n[LAUGH]\n>> If it actually works?\n\n626\n00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,630\nYeah it's going to work\nwe installed it together.\n\n627\n00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,960\n>> Alright let's verify\nthat it's going to work.\n\n628\n00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,650\n>> It's gonna work great.\n\n629\n00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,450\n>> All right, sounds good.\n\n630\n00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,580\n>> All right, so\non my machine here, all right so\n\n631\n00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,280\nhere we go, so there's that machine,\nsays it's running, idling down.\n\n632\n00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,050\nNow Ronnie, do you remember how much\nmemory we assigned this virtual machine?\n\n633\n00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,090\n>> We assigned about 2 gigs of\nmemory to the virtual machine.\n\n634\n00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:44,420\nAll right and so we allowed dynamic\nmemory, so now it's using 910 MB.\n\n635\n00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,725\n>> So a little bit less than a Gig.\n\n636\n00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:50,110\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, a little bit less,\nyeah, less than a Gig, 1024.\n\n637\n00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:54,098\nAnd so it's just sitting there,\nhanging out, which is fine.\n\n638\n00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:58,810\nSo we can click on it, and right there we\ncan see the little preview window that is\n\n639\n00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,220\nsitting right now at its start screen.\n\n640\n00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,680\nWe can just right click on this guy and\nchoose connect to bring up its console.\n\n641\n00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,960\nNow the aspect ratio on\nthis is a little off so\n\n642\n00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,968\nwe've got these little\nscroll bars on the side.\n\n643\n00:33:11,968 --> 00:33:18,250\nAnd apart from that,\nthis will function as a real PC.\n\n644\n00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,950\nSo first thing's first,\nlet's change that ratio.\n\n645\n00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,610\nLet's go to the desktop and\nwe'll right-click.\n\n646\n00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,091\nLet's change our screen resolution.\n\n647\n00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:32,270\nLet's change it to 1280 by 720.\n\n648\n00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,615\n>> Sounds good to me.\n\n649\n00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:37,910\n>> Keep changes.\n\n650\n00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:43,670\nOh yeah, I guess the resolution\non my host OS is a bit small.\n\n651\n00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,210\nWhat are we at?\n\n652\n00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,324\nI think we're at 720.\n\n653\n00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,770\n768, well there we go.\n\n654\n00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,770\nLet's go view full screen.\n\n655\n00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,880\nSweet.\n>> Very nice.\n\n656\n00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,929\nAnd then on this little bar here\nthere's little thumbtack here, so\n\n657\n00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:03,730\nto choose to pin or\nunpin this little button there.\n\n658\n00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,480\nWe'll just unpin it.\n\n659\n00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,760\nAnd it should go away here in a second.\n\n660\n00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,210\nWhat we could do,\nI think we've got 1366 x 768 right there.\n\n661\n00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,050\nDown there.\n\n662\n00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,720\nGo and apply.\n\n663\n00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,270\nKeep the changes.\n\n664\n00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,560\n>> There you go.\n>> All right, there we go.\n\n665\n00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,140\nSo now our virtual machine is now\nfilling the screen on my machine.\n\n666\n00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,280\nAs I go through and I can click on things.\n\n667\n00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,330\nWe've got a floppy drive, that's cool.\n\n668\n00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,990\n>> And so, on the DVD drive, right, so\n\n669\n00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:39,890\nthis is our installation media, that we\nleft in our DVD drive from installing it.\n\n670\n00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:42,860\nThere's that guy there, and\na little hard drive here,\n\n671\n00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,770\nand it shows as a 60 gigabyte hard drive.\n\n672\n00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:51,050\nAnd we can go around and click on and\ndo things as if it was indeed a real PC,\n\n673\n00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,580\neven though it is being virtualized\non our existing hard drive.\n\n674\n00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,130\nNow, of course, the thing that\nwill not work there is internet,\n\n675\n00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,260\nbecause we haven't set up any network yet.\n\n676\n00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,710\nBut we'll set that up on the service side.\n\n677\n00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,770\n>> Right.\n\n678\n00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,210\nAll right, so,\nas far as that goes, I mean.\n\n679\n00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:09,850\n>> Looks good?\n\n680\n00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,310\n>> Yeah.\nWe should be running just\n\n681\n00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,860\nfine using a bit of memory.\n\n682\n00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:19,112\nOf course, it is dynamic so\nit's memory usage will continue be\n\n683\n00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:22,980\nhigh cuz it doesn't really go\ndown very low when it does.\n\n684\n00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,030\nIt just releases memory.\n\n685\n00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,070\nAs it goes.\n\n686\n00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,570\n>> Yup.\n\n687\n00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,410\n>> All right, so that is that.\n\n688\n00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,070\nThat is that.\n\n689\n00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,820\nAnd I guess we can just go up here.\n\n690\n00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,602\nWhere's the [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n691\n00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,720\n>> Where my, normally.\n\n692\n00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,940\nSee, Ronnie's snickering over here\nbecause normally when you mouse up,\n\n693\n00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,240\nit goes up there.\n\n694\n00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,160\nBut at this point it is not, it's not.\n\n695\n00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,040\n>> Not going away on you.\n\n696\n00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,830\n>> No.\n>> You're gonna have\n\n697\n00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,590\nto shut that thing down or sign out.\n\n698\n00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:00,310\nOr, not even gonna let you do that.\n\n699\n00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,265\n>> There we go.\n\n700\n00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:03,836\nHuh.\n\n701\n00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:07,330\nYeah, oh Nate's in a conundrum now.\n\n702\n00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,380\n>> All right.\nLet's see.\n\n703\n00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,710\n>> All right, so in terms of the actual\n\n704\n00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,210\nvirtual machine that we've created,\nit's running perfectly fine.\n\n705\n00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,020\nNate's still actually got his other\ncomputer up and running here.\n\n706\n00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,470\nThis gives us the ability to test it out.\n\n707\n00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,510\nNow, we can do this not only with\nWindows eight machines here.\n\n708\n00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:27,430\nBut we can run pretty much any version\nof Windows that we want to, and\n\n709\n00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,110\nyou can even go ahead and\npossibly install,\n\n710\n00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,100\nof course, other operating systems,\nsuch as Linux operating system as well,\n\n711\n00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,450\nand that way you can go ahead and\nrun that too if you need to.\n\n712\n00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:40,990\nNow we're going to switch on\nover to our server side and\n\n713\n00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:46,700\npretty much kind of show you the idea of\ncreating an advanced type of VM as well.\n\n714\n00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,630\nNow, this is not just following\nthrough the wizard here, but\n\n715\n00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,920\nwhat we've done is we went ahead and\n\n716\n00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,270\ninstalled a copy of Windows Server\n2012 into a VM we've launched up here.\n\n717\n00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,730\nBut we wanna show you that you\ncan actually reconfigure that.\n\n718\n00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,260\nTo give you some different\noptions as well.\n\n719\n00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,220\n>> So I ended up just shutting\ndown that virtual machine.\n\n720\n00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,860\nSo it got shut down so we got back here.\n\n721\n00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,672\nWe'll just close that console window.\n\n722\n00:37:09,672 --> 00:37:16,790\nAll right so over in our server,\nand so we went ahead and\n\n723\n00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:21,420\ninstalled Windows Server 2012 during\nthe break, and it is up and running.\n\n724\n00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,950\nAnd it has settled down much lower\nthan that Windows 8 machine.\n\n725\n00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,150\nWindows 8 was, what,\nnine hundred and something?\n\n726\n00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,920\nServer's at 618, so, it's settled down.\n\n727\n00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,820\nAnd now for this,\nwe can choose to connect to it.\n\n728\n00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:40,350\nAnd there we go, so Windows Server 2012\nautomatically launches up into our\n\n729\n00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,900\nServer Manager, we can minimize\nServer Manager and there we go.\n\n730\n00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,750\nThere's our desktop, and we can click\naround and do server type things.\n\n731\n00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,657\nNow so Ronnie, whats next?\n\n732\n00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:52,360\nWhat should we do?\n\n733\n00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,400\n>> Want to take a look at some\nof those advance features again.\n\n734\n00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,920\nSo the menu that we showed\nyou a little bit earlier.\n\n735\n00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,670\nWhere we were taking a look at\nthe hardware features here.\n\n736\n00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,270\nSome of the different things that\nwe could configure from that point.\n\n737\n00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,470\nThat's where we wanna go now and kind of\nexplore those a little bit more in depth.\n\n738\n00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,270\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at those options, Nate.\n\n739\n00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,048\nIn the VM configuration.\n\n740\n00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:15,810\n>> All right so, we click on our\nvirtual machine to give it focus.\n\n741\n00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,590\nAnd we right click and\nwe can choose settings.\n\n742\n00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,510\n>> There we go.\n\n743\n00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:25,195\nAnd in our settings menu here now\nwe cannot change any of this stuff.\n\n744\n00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:28,375\nSo startup RAM,\nwe can't change any of that.\n\n745\n00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:31,395\nThe boot process, we can't turn that off.\n\n746\n00:38:32,415 --> 00:38:34,315\nProcessors, we can't change anything.\n\n747\n00:38:34,315 --> 00:38:37,600\nRonnie, do you have a guess as to\nwhy we can't, cannot change this?\n\n748\n00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,330\n>> More than likely it's because it's on.\n\n749\n00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,047\nIt's turned on.\n\n750\n00:38:40,047 --> 00:38:44,830\n>> (Laughs) Yep, so then just like\non a real PC, if it's powered on,\n\n751\n00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,740\nyou can't change the processor.\n\n752\n00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,660\n>> Right.\n>> You can't change\n\n753\n00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,360\nsome of the hardware configurations\nwhile the guy is powered on.\n\n754\n00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,140\nWhat do you do?\n\n755\n00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,928\nWell, you power it off.\n\n756\n00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:57,470\nWell, what we can do we can right click or\nleft click.\n\n757\n00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,790\nRight click and we can go to shut down.\n\n758\n00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:06,610\nAnd it will issue out the shut down\ncommand, do you wanna shut it down.\n\n759\n00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,090\nYeah sure.\n\n760\n00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,150\nAnd a little preview window here in\na minute we should see that blue,\n\n761\n00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,895\nscreen sure enough that is shutting down.\n\n762\n00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:14,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n763\n00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,490\n>> So\nyou shut it down from that settings or\n\n764\n00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:21,200\nfrom that right click menu as opposed to\ngoing back to, wow that was really fast.\n\n765\n00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,890\n>> Now we actually have a couple of\noptions here Nate, turn off or shut down.\n\n766\n00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,670\nWhat's the real big difference\nthere on either one.\n\n767\n00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:33,283\n>> Shutdown is like the graceful shutdown,\nI guess we don't have it on view now.\n\n768\n00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:36,130\nYeah, shutdown is\ngracefully shutting down.\n\n769\n00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,919\nTurn off is just like yanking\nthe power from that virtual machine.\n\n770\n00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:44,362\nIf you needed to quickly turn off, for\nwhatever reason you can just right click\n\n771\n00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:48,282\nand choose turn off and yeah it's\njust like yanking that power cord.\n\n772\n00:39:48,282 --> 00:39:51,310\n>> So why not choose that one?\n\n773\n00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,276\nWhy did you just choose\nthe shout down instead?\n\n774\n00:39:53,276 --> 00:39:54,296\nIs there a reason?\n\n775\n00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:56,981\n>> Well cuz that way when we turn\nit back on it's gonna say hey,\n\n776\n00:39:56,981 --> 00:40:00,710\nWindows shut down improperly and it's\ngonna go through some of that check stuff.\n\n777\n00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,180\n>> Yeah, even though it's\njust a virtual machine and\n\n778\n00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,360\nwe don't have any hardware installed\non it in terms of hardware.\n\n779\n00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,960\nThe problem is, again we want to\ngracefully shut down the operating system.\n\n780\n00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,980\nSo it finishes all the writes that she\nneeds to do before it actually shuts down.\n\n781\n00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,180\nSo, we again wanna treat this\nas if it's a real machine.\n\n782\n00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,450\nThat's what we wanna do.\n\n783\n00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,030\nDon't take it for granted,\neven though it's a virtual machine.\n\n784\n00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,860\nMake sure you do everything that you\nwould do on a regular physical machine,\n\n785\n00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:31,430\neven if you are gonna change\nsome of the hardware components.\n\n786\n00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:35,793\nSo then, back over here,\nlet us see here, virtual machine wizard,\n\n787\n00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:38,066\nall right, let's close that out.\n\n788\n00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:41,275\nOh, cancel.\n\n789\n00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:44,255\nHa, ha.\n\n790\n00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:46,780\nClose that out all right.\n\n791\n00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,580\nSo Ronnie.\n\n792\n00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,760\n>> Yes?\n>> So we still cannot.\n\n793\n00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,350\n>> Oh no.\n\n794\n00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:54,000\n>> We still can't change everything,\neven though it is power down\n\n795\n00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,310\n>> All right, so what's next, Nate?\n\n796\n00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,470\n>> All right, so keep this in mind.\n\n797\n00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:02,040\nWe could not change anything\nbecause the machine was powered on.\n\n798\n00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,340\nWe had to power it off.\n\n799\n00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,410\nAnd it's powered off now.\n\n800\n00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,740\nWe still cannot change anything.\n\n801\n00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,750\nAnd that is because I think even in\nthe settings it will It'll tell us.\n\n802\n00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,328\nSo down there at that\nlittle window down there.\n\n803\n00:41:16,328 --> 00:41:20,420\nSome settings cannot be changed because\nthe virtual machine was running,\n\n804\n00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,340\nwhile the settings window was open.\n\n805\n00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,960\nSo you have to keep that in mind.\n\n806\n00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,870\nSo we'll just hit cancel on that,\nwe'll go back in open up our settings.\n\n807\n00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:33,860\nAnd now we should have\nthose options to change.\n\n808\n00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,450\n>> Look, you can disable secure booth.\n\n809\n00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,570\n>> So, we can turn off secure booth if\nwhatever we're doing with our machine\n\n810\n00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,240\nrequires it.\n\n811\n00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,110\nAnd on the boot order.\n\n812\n00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:48,420\nSo, we don't really have like a real\nBIOS in these virtual machines.\n\n813\n00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,020\nWe kinda have this little,\nwe can change the boot order but\n\n814\n00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,980\nthat's kinda about it as far as it goes.\n\n815\n00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,730\nChange however you want to boot up.\n\n816\n00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:01,410\nOur network adapter, if we wanted to pixie\nboot this guy, or boot off the hard drive.\n\n817\n00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:04,526\nThere's a DVD drive and\nall that fun stuff.\n\n818\n00:42:04,526 --> 00:42:08,984\nWas there anything else?\n\n819\n00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:09,816\n>> I don't think so.\n\n820\n00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:11,483\n>> Yeah, that's good.\n\n821\n00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:15,070\nAll right, into our memory we\ncan change up our start up RAM.\n\n822\n00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,690\nAnd of course, this is the number that\nit grabs initially as it powers on.\n\n823\n00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:22,680\nAnd we have dynamic memory enabled.\n\n824\n00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:29,370\nNow it will use as few as 512 megabytes\nof RAM, so it won't go down below that.\n\n825\n00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:35,660\nAnd for\nmaximum RAM it is like a terabyte of RAM.\n\n826\n00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,880\n>> Looks just about like that yeah.\n\n827\n00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,210\n>> Yeah its quite a bit.\n\n828\n00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:41,240\nSo yeah, we can, whatnot.\n\n829\n00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,610\nSo we do have a buffer,\na buffer space on this.\n\n830\n00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,900\nAllows us to optimize our memory usage,\n\n831\n00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,815\nso these machines won't take too much or\nthe demand for it.\n\n832\n00:42:51,815 --> 00:42:52,365\n>> Right.\n\n833\n00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:55,755\n>> And then the memory weight slider for\n\n834\n00:42:55,755 --> 00:43:00,355\nthe prioritizing of the other\nmemory that is available.\n\n835\n00:43:00,355 --> 00:43:04,150\nIf there are some virtual machines\nthat are more critical than others.\n\n836\n00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,160\nThen we can raise this up so\nwe can have priority\n\n837\n00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,960\nover memory compared to some other\nvirtual machines that we have.\n\n838\n00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,800\nSo, like little work stations then\nthey can have lower memory weight.\n\n839\n00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,066\nSome of our more critical servers\nhave it a little bit higher.\n\n840\n00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,540\nNow, for our processors.\n\n841\n00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:29,703\nNow see if we have a multi-core processor.\n\n842\n00:43:29,703 --> 00:43:32,490\nThat way we assign.\n\n843\n00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:38,470\nThis virtual machine just has one virtual\nprocessor we can click this number up.\n\n844\n00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,260\nAnd we can give it more processors\n\n845\n00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,160\nup to the maximum amount of\nprocessors in this machine.\n\n846\n00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,010\nSo, this machine right here\nis a dual-core processor and\n\n847\n00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,030\nif I click on my little mouse,\nI cannot go higher than two.\n\n848\n00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:57,048\nWe had a quad-core processor,\n\n849\n00:43:57,048 --> 00:44:02,300\na six-core processor, that we can assign\nmultiple cores to these virtual machines.\n\n850\n00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,670\nPerhaps if we had say a quad-core machine,\nand\n\n851\n00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:08,220\nwe're only running two\nvirtual machines on.\n\n852\n00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,770\nWell we could split up and\ngive them two cores apiece, and\n\n853\n00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:15,240\njust eke out a bit more\nof that performance.\n\n854\n00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,190\nThe only time you really\nrun into issues here,\n\n855\n00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,810\nis not with the newer operating systems,\nbut something like Windows XP, right?\n\n856\n00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,380\nWith that older operating system,\n\n857\n00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,530\nit really only recognizes a max\nof two particular cores anyways.\n\n858\n00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,491\nSo if you actually did\nrun this on a server and\n\n859\n00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:32,895\nit gives the plus 8, 16 which is insane.\n\n860\n00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,660\nYou don't want to actually assign that\nbecause some of those older operating\n\n861\n00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:40,700\nsystems will take and not play well\nthat and may have some issues.\n\n862\n00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,610\nSo only do the max of the operating\nsystem will actually recognize,\n\n863\n00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,080\nif you're going to do this to try and\ngive it a little more performance.\n\n864\n00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,510\n>> So we do have the resource\ncontrol down below it.\n\n865\n00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:56,120\nIf we want to throttle or\nkind of limit the amount\n\n866\n00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,360\nof processor that these machines\nare able to take away or tie up.\n\n867\n00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:08,040\nLet me click on down here, and\nwe've got some fun stuff right here.\n\n868\n00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,890\nProcessor compatibility.\n\n869\n00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,890\nSome of these options in here, Ronnie,\n\n870\n00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:17,440\nI don't really use too much in my day\nto day hacker being kind of stuff.\n\n871\n00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,597\nWe've got those NUMA nodes that we can\ntake advantage of, if we have those.\n\n872\n00:45:22,597 --> 00:45:28,510\n>> All right, and our SCSI controller,\nwhich we're on to which,\n\n873\n00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:32,840\non the last segment, you were so\nkind as to explain our SCSI controller.\n\n874\n00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:40,110\nNow, this machine here Firmware we\nhave Secure Boot, we have no IDE,\n\n875\n00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:44,660\ncontrollers and adding Firmware,\nwe do not have our legacy adapter.\n\n876\n00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,680\nSo Ronnie can you take a guess a little\nknowledge check on what generation\n\n877\n00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,100\nmachine that we are running.\n\n878\n00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,350\nI'm going to say this is a generation 2.\n\n879\n00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:56,250\n>> Correct, so this is indeed\na generation 2 machine because\n\n880\n00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,200\nwe don't have a legacy network adapter.\n\n881\n00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,290\nWe have our Secure Boot,\nwe don't have our IDE stuff, here,\n\n882\n00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,930\nso that is why they are missing.\n\n883\n00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:10,110\nAll right and in here drill\ndown areas are our hard drive.\n\n884\n00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:16,090\nFrom here we can choose to get rid of this\nhard drive or all the other fun stuff.\n\n885\n00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:19,860\nWe can just remove this\nhard drive all together.\n\n886\n00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,665\nNow let's saw that if we wanted to have\nmultiple hard drives on our machine.\n\n887\n00:46:24,665 --> 00:46:29,560\nWe we can just select our SCSI\ncontroller and you can pick one.\n\n888\n00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,110\nLet's just add another hard drive and\nthere you go.\n\n889\n00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,210\nAnd right now it's just a blank hard\ndrive just like a place holder.\n\n890\n00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:38,320\nAnd what we can do.\n\n891\n00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,830\nWe just click on the new button there,\nand we've seen this menu before.\n\n892\n00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:42,920\nSo we just kind of click through.\n\n893\n00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,316\nAnd on this one.\n\n894\n00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,960\nAlso WinServ2012.\n\n895\n00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,110\nYeah, that's what it's called.\n\n896\n00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,810\nWe'll just call this B\nsince this is B disk.\n\n897\n00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,030\nVHDX we'll stick it in there, that works.\n\n898\n00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,020\nAnd then our 27 is fine.\n\n899\n00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,830\nFinish so, there it goes.\n\n900\n00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:14,350\nSo now we have a hard drive B down here\nand our standard hard drive up here.\n\n901\n00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:16,240\nSo now two hard drives on our computer.\n\n902\n00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,720\nAll right,\nI'm gonna click on apply on this guy.\n\n903\n00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,770\nNow under our hard drive here.\n\n904\n00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,510\nSo, some of our advanced features.\n\n905\n00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:32,450\nWe can implement our quality of service,\ndifferent ways of\n\n906\n00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:38,420\nmaximizing our performance\nonto our hard drive.\n\n907\n00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,203\nAnd enable virtual hard disk sharing, so\n\n908\n00:47:41,203 --> 00:47:44,150\nthat stuff's there if\nwe needed to do that.\n\n909\n00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:48,061\nAll right,\n\n910\n00:47:48,061 --> 00:47:53,830\nsee here now our DVD drive Standard\nstuff there not a whole lot to change.\n\n911\n00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,960\nAll right network adaptor,\nRonnie you want to get this guy, so\n\n912\n00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,903\nthere are features that we\ncan change in here and do.\n\n913\n00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:05,820\n>> All right go ahead and\nclick on that virtual switch here and\n\n914\n00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,780\nlets see what we have options available.\n\n915\n00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,190\nNow the first thing that we have here\nright, is because this is a virtual\n\n916\n00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:14,170\nmachine there's no physical\nnetwork adaptor to plug.\n\n917\n00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,330\nAn actual physical cable entity.\n\n918\n00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:20,530\nSo, of course, that means we actually\nhave to do this virtually, right?\n\n919\n00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,790\nSo, in that sense,\n\n920\n00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,680\nthat means we actually have to\ncreate something it can connect to.\n\n921\n00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,620\nSo, Nate, since we don't have a,\n\n922\n00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,920\nan actual switch to connect to\nhere we may have to do that first.\n\n923\n00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:35,090\n>> Alright so\nyes we'll create a virtual switch.\n\n924\n00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:35,750\nAlright.\n\n925\n00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,490\nAlright so we'll just go ahead and\nclick on cancel on all these settings.\n\n926\n00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,309\nI think we, I think we're okay because\nwe'll just add that to our hard drive.\n\n927\n00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:49,140\nAll right so\nover in our actions pane to create that\n\n928\n00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:54,430\nvirtual switch is down here in\nour virtual switch manager.\n\n929\n00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,470\nAnd clicking on this, all right so\n\n930\n00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:03,250\nwe've got three types of virtual\nswitches that we can create.\n\n931\n00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,749\nRonnie do you know\nthe differences between those.\n\n932\n00:49:05,749 --> 00:49:06,980\n>> Yes okay.\n\n933\n00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,830\nSo in terms of actually these\ndifferent switches, right.\n\n934\n00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:13,090\nSo this works just like\na regular switch does but again,\n\n935\n00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:17,010\nbecause it's all software we don't really\nhave a physical interface to go to.\n\n936\n00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:21,300\nThe external network adaptor is normally\nthe regular adaptor that we have,\n\n937\n00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,990\nthat we want this virtual machine to be\nable to connect to the outside world.\n\n938\n00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:28,730\nSo this gives us the ability to\nessentially connect this to the same\n\n939\n00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:31,810\nnetwork that your physical machine is on.\n\n940\n00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:34,280\nSo what it can do is actually go\nout to your regular gateway of\n\n941\n00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,530\nthe machine that you're on here,\nthat'll connect out to the world.\n\n942\n00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:40,490\nSo we can actually create\nthat type of switch, and\n\n943\n00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,970\nthen connect that VM to that\npicker switch if we choose to.\n\n944\n00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,820\nThere's also another type\nthat we call internal.\n\n945\n00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,020\nInternal allows you to be able to\ntake this VM that we've got here.\n\n946\n00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,570\nAnd allow it to talk to\nthe actual host adapter,\n\n947\n00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,080\nthe host machine to be able to\ndo that if we want to as well.\n\n948\n00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:02,000\nAnd all the other VMs that we create,\nwe attach that to the internal switch.\n\n949\n00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,740\nThey'll be able to communicate with\neach other and the host VM as well.\n\n950\n00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,303\nNow we don't want to\ncompletely isolated network,\n\n951\n00:50:08,303 --> 00:50:12,130\none that can't connect outside world,\nthat can connect to other VMs.\n\n952\n00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:15,360\nWe can create a private switch\nthat will only allow them to talk\n\n953\n00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,590\nto each other as well.\n\n954\n00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,900\nSo, depending on what we need,\n\n955\n00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,430\nthis is where we actually\nhave to make a selection.\n\n956\n00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,430\n>> All right Ronnie.\n\n957\n00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:27,190\nSo, based off of those right there,\nwhat kind of switch should we make.\n\n958\n00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,200\n>> Just go ahead and\ncreate the external one.\n\n959\n00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,920\n>> External?\n>> Yeah, let's do it.\n\n960\n00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,100\n>> All right, external switch,\nyou know what?\n\n961\n00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,925\nActually, let's do a private switch.\n\n962\n00:50:35,925 --> 00:50:37,700\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, let's do a private switch then,\n\n963\n00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,440\nsince\n>> Well,\n\n964\n00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,410\nyeah because it's going to\nreconfigure our network adapter.\n\n965\n00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,020\nIt'll drop us out of our AP session.\n\n966\n00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,750\n>> Create a private switch then.\n\n967\n00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,530\n>> All right.\n\n968\n00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,910\nCreate a private switch and\nwe'll click on create.\n\n969\n00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:54,670\nAll right.\n\n970\n00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,320\nDo we have a name for it?\n\n971\n00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,985\n>> Private.\n>> Network.\n\n972\n00:51:00,985 --> 00:51:06,311\n[SOUND] All right there we go.\n\n973\n00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:11,276\nAll right, so funny so once again even\nthough we chose to create it private we\n\n974\n00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:14,500\ncan change it right here if we want to.\n\n975\n00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,980\nBut select your private network.\n\n976\n00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,020\n>> All right.\n\n977\n00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,430\nNow if we were to do an external network,\nall right.\n\n978\n00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,130\nTo do an external network,\nwe'd have to bind it to\n\n979\n00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:28,660\nsome physical network adapter to allow\nthese virtual machines to I guess,\n\n980\n00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:34,180\nuse this virtual switch to communicate\nwith other computers on our network.\n\n981\n00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,090\nTo connect out to the Internet,\nand use those sorts of things.\n\n982\n00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,610\nNow on this particular machine here,\n\n983\n00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:44,770\nwe just have one physical network adapter,\nso we can bind it to that.\n\n984\n00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:51,650\nNow, if we wanted to dedicate a network\nadapter to this virtual machine,\n\n985\n00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:56,350\nto this virtual switch we can\nuncheck this box right here.\n\n986\n00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:00,860\nSo, that way when we go into Windows,\nor into our host OS,\n\n987\n00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,970\nit would not be able to use\nthis adapter for anything.\n\n988\n00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,930\nIt would show it as being connected,\nknows it.\n\n989\n00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:15,040\nSo, and also if we get into our Network\nand Sharing Center our adapter settings.\n\n990\n00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,960\nSo here we can browse into, we can see\ndetails about this network adapter.\n\n991\n00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:26,740\nIf in our Virtual Switch Manager we\nuncheck this box, so we do not want our\n\n992\n00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:32,330\nhost OS to manage this controller, and\nwhen we browse in here it'd just be blank.\n\n993\n00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:35,220\nIt wouldn't have anything it wouldn't\nknow what was going on with it.\n\n994\n00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,160\nIt would just be completely blanked out.\n\n995\n00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,190\nNow of course if we wanted the host OS\nto share it I've got to check this box.\n\n996\n00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,030\nNow enable single root IO virtualization.\n\n997\n00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:53,630\nThis guy right here is like a pass\nthrough directly to to that network card.\n\n998\n00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:58,850\nIf you have some kind of\nintense application or service,\n\n999\n00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:05,490\nmaybe like a file server or something that\nyou need latency to an absolute minimum.\n\n1000\n00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:09,950\nYou can use this option right here and\nit will let the VM talk directly\n\n1001\n00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:14,230\nto this network card, or\nthe switch directly to it.\n\n1002\n00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,640\nAnd get the fast minimum latency.\n\n1003\n00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,480\nSo there's options there, internal, okay.\n\n1004\n00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,350\nSo then private.\n\n1005\n00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:29,400\nAll right, so Ronnie, this right here\nis kind of up your alley, right?\n\n1006\n00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,411\nSo if we had our-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1007\n00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:33,671\n>> Internal network,\n\n1008\n00:53:33,671 --> 00:53:35,380\nour\n>> V LAN ID.\n\n1009\n00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,760\nSo a quick little run down on V LAN.\n\n1010\n00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,920\n>> The idea of using the V LAN right,\nallows us to go and\n\n1011\n00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,030\ncreate multiple networks on the same\nphysical switch is what we want to do.\n\n1012\n00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,146\nA lot of times we're not\nactually using this though.\n\n1013\n00:53:50,146 --> 00:53:53,840\nIt may be that what we want to do\nis isolate every single VM and\n\n1014\n00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,920\nput them on it's own network, this gives\nus the ability to do that if we want to.\n\n1015\n00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,460\nYep.\n\n1016\n00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:04,470\n>> All right, so right now it says\nnumber two, that would be its VLAN tag,\n\n1017\n00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:09,110\nand now, so if we wanted it for VLAN 10,\nwe'd put an eight, ha ha, just kidding,\n\n1018\n00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:13,100\n10, if we wanna use that VLAN ID.\n\n1019\n00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,810\n>> All right.\n\n1020\n00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:16,610\n>> All right, so as I\n>> Seen this before.\n\n1021\n00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:20,130\nVlan tagging, it's a standard.\n\n1022\n00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,742\nWhether we're using like Cisco switches or\n\n1023\n00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:25,680\nsomething else it would\nroute all the same.\n\n1024\n00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,250\n>> Yeah if you actually have\nan existing vlan on your network\n\n1025\n00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,920\nit should be able to put\nthat virtual machine.\n\n1026\n00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,680\nThat we attach to this,\nI should say this network,\n\n1027\n00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:40,450\nthis network switch here,\nto that other VLAN that you have existing.\n\n1028\n00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,250\nI should say just that one VM.\n\n1029\n00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,820\n>> All right, so\nwe'll go ahead a private switch.\n\n1030\n00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,260\nWhen it's all said and done, I feel bad.\n\n1031\n00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,990\nI asked your opinion and\nI completely just changed it.\n\n1032\n00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,750\n>> Changed my opinion,\njust changed what I want to do.\n\n1033\n00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:00,420\n>> All right, so\nwe'll click apply on that, and okay.\n\n1034\n00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,690\nClose this.\n\n1035\n00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,240\nClose the others.\n\n1036\n00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,520\nAll right, so now what we have right\nhere is our private network, right, so\n\n1037\n00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,790\nour private switch.\n\n1038\n00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:10,820\n>> Yup.\n\n1039\n00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,120\nSo now all we have to do is\nwe have to take that v out.\n\n1040\n00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,520\nAnd we need to attach it to the switch.\n\n1041\n00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,450\n>> And so\nwe'll go back into our settings here and\n\n1042\n00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,760\nour network adapter down here,\nwe can click on this guy.\n\n1043\n00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,995\nAnd under our virtual switches,\nwe can drop this little box down.\n\n1044\n00:55:26,995 --> 00:55:33,620\n[CROSSTALK] And so now we've got our\nprivate network that we can click on here.\n\n1045\n00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,680\nNow Ronnie, so we can also add some VLAN.\n\n1046\n00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,690\n>> Oh, look at there.\n\n1047\n00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,695\nYeah, there you go.\n\n1048\n00:55:37,695 --> 00:55:39,940\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Just on that switch.\n\n1049\n00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,252\nWe can change things there.\n\n1050\n00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:47,500\nNow we do have an option down here for\nour bandwidth management.\n\n1051\n00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:52,556\nWe can click on this and\nessentially throttle our bandwidth.\n\n1052\n00:55:52,556 --> 00:55:54,596\nComing in off of that card.\n\n1053\n00:55:54,596 --> 00:55:58,675\nSo, if we didn't want sort of\na virtual machine to, I guess,\n\n1054\n00:55:58,675 --> 00:56:02,920\nhog all of the bandwidth,\nwe can throttle this guy right there.\n\n1055\n00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,665\nAll right, we'll click on apply, oh wait.\n\n1056\n00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:08,625\nCannot apply as-\n>> Oh.\n\n1057\n00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:10,690\nYou can't make it a zero.\n\n1058\n00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:11,335\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oops.\n\n1059\n00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:12,775\nAll right, let's just uncheck that.\n\n1060\n00:56:12,775 --> 00:56:13,535\nApply. Okay. Whoo.\n\n1061\n00:56:13,535 --> 00:56:14,255\n>> There you go.\n\n1062\n00:56:14,255 --> 00:56:16,725\n>> It's like, oh my goodness,\nthis works nine times out of ten.\n\n1063\n00:56:18,505 --> 00:56:20,315\nAll right.\nSo there you go.\n\n1064\n00:56:20,315 --> 00:56:22,305\nNow, we are just coming\nup here on break time.\n\n1065\n00:56:22,305 --> 00:56:24,760\nWe've got a few more\nsettings to get through.\n\n1066\n00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,000\n>> All right.\n>> In our virtual machine to\n\n1067\n00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,580\ncustomize it for what we're after.\n\n1068\n00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,280\n>> That's true.\n>> But,\n\n1069\n00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,430\nwe'll get into all that\nfun stuff after the break.\n\n1070\n00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:30,940\n>> Sounds great.\n\n1071\n00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,650\n>> Sweet.\nAll Right.\n\n1072\n00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,698\nAll that stuff after the break.\n\n1073\n00:56:34,698 --> 00:56:41,754\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back.\n\n1074\n00:56:41,754 --> 00:56:43,400\nAll right.\nSo where we left off,\n\n1075\n00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,284\nwe added that network adapter card, or\nthat virtual switch, onto our network\n\n1076\n00:56:48,284 --> 00:56:53,200\nadapter and started digging in through\nsome of those advanced settings.\n\n1077\n00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,115\nThere's a few more that we\ncan touch on and get through.\n\n1078\n00:56:56,115 --> 00:56:58,965\nWe've got some management\nstuff to touch on as well.\n\n1079\n00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:01,038\n>> Right, sounds good.\n\n1080\n00:57:01,038 --> 00:57:04,202\n>> All right, so on the PC here.\n\n1081\n00:57:04,202 --> 00:57:07,812\nSo you've got our network\nadapter here pulled up,\n\n1082\n00:57:07,812 --> 00:57:10,222\nand we talked about some of those.\n\n1083\n00:57:10,222 --> 00:57:15,122\nSo under this hardware acceleration,\nthese items in here will just be for\n\n1084\n00:57:15,122 --> 00:57:20,020\njust optimizing some of\nthe functionality of our\n\n1085\n00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:24,980\nnetwork card based on\nwhatever our needs are.\n\n1086\n00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:30,130\nVirtual machine Q, for Q's update,\nthe packets heading from\n\n1087\n00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:36,050\nvirtual machines heading into this network\nadapter, good old IP sect task offloading.\n\n1088\n00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:40,800\nWe can put off those calculations\nonto our physical card there,\n\n1089\n00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,270\nof course if our physical network\ncard supports that stuff.\n\n1090\n00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:50,605\nWe have our single route IO\nwhich is that pass through and\n\n1091\n00:57:50,605 --> 00:57:55,600\nexit directly and\ninto this advanced features.\n\n1092\n00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,640\nNow on our network card we\ncan pick a Mac address.\n\n1093\n00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:05,315\nNow we can dynamically assign one, or if\nwe had a particular Mac address in mind,\n\n1094\n00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:09,675\nwe can statically map it and\nchoose whichever one that we want.\n\n1095\n00:58:09,675 --> 00:58:15,330\nAnd it was a good old DHC guard and\nrouter guard.\n\n1096\n00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:19,251\nIn a little bit there we'll drop packets\ndepending on if we wanted to block\n\n1097\n00:58:19,251 --> 00:58:20,400\nthose things there.\n\n1098\n00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,380\nAnd then we have a protected network,\nso if our network connection goes down,\n\n1099\n00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,910\nthere's some critical operation,\nthen we can automatically move that over.\n\n1100\n00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:34,504\nAnd we've got port mirroring,\nport bearing.\n\n1101\n00:58:34,504 --> 00:58:37,550\nIf we wanted to monitor\na particular device.\n\n1102\n00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:41,800\nIf we wanted to, I guess, have whatever\ntraffic is coming in and out of it,\n\n1103\n00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,871\nwe could choose to have it-\n>> Send copies of it over to another port.\n\n1104\n00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:45,521\n>> Yep.\n\n1105\n00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:48,962\nSend copies over to another port,\nand we have destination and\n\n1106\n00:58:48,962 --> 00:58:51,958\nsource depending on which\none that we are setting up.\n\n1107\n00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:57,144\nAnd then NIC teaming,\nif we want to set up a team of NICs.\n\n1108\n00:58:57,144 --> 00:58:59,900\nRight?\nSo, if we have two network adapters, and\n\n1109\n00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:06,940\nwe wanted to bond them together to operate\nas one card, we can enable that here.\n\n1110\n00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,580\nAll right Ron, anything in those?\n\n1111\n00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,820\nThat-\n>> Well remember,\n\n1112\n00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,940\nnetwork configuration is one of the more\nimportant things that we want to ensure\n\n1113\n00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:19,490\nthat our virtual machines can\ncommunicate with each other or\n\n1114\n00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:23,370\nif they're actually gonna be managing part\nof our network for us such as web servers,\n\n1115\n00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:24,990\nDHCP servers, everything.\n\n1116\n00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:30,380\nWe've gotta make sure that our VMs are\nable to connect into the physical network.\n\n1117\n00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,940\nSo by choosing the right\ntype of switch first, and\n\n1118\n00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:38,100\nthen being able to connect the actual\nvirtual network adapter to that switch,\n\n1119\n00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,760\nit should make this actually\nthe way that we need to.\n\n1120\n00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,880\nSo you may have to go into some of the\nadvanced options again to kind of turn on\n\n1121\n00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,890\nand turn off some of the features, you\nmay actually have to do, to help optimize\n\n1122\n00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:53,110\nthe way that this actually does connect\nand work with the rest of your network.\n\n1123\n00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:56,623\nSo do make sure you take\na look in those features.\n\n1124\n00:59:56,623 --> 00:59:57,446\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n1125\n00:59:57,446 --> 00:59:58,600\nSo we've got through all of those.\n\n1126\n00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,210\nAnd so what's next?\n\n1127\n01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,870\nWhere do we move on?\n\n1128\n01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:05,850\n>> I think as we go down the list here\nwe are moving on to the idea of some\n\n1129\n01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,260\ndifferent management features that\nwe have to be able to take care of.\n\n1130\n01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,200\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at those too.\n\n1131\n01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:12,850\n>> All right.\n\n1132\n01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,531\nSo down here,\nit's the very first option here.\n\n1133\n01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:16,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's pretty straightforward.\n\n1134\n01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,376\nWe just name our machine.\n\n1135\n01:00:17,376 --> 01:00:21,820\nWe're gonna change that here and\nadd some notes like.\n\n1136\n01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:25,957\nWell, we won't add any notes on this one.\n\n1137\n01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:26,678\nAll right.\n\n1138\n01:00:26,678 --> 01:00:29,100\nOur integration services.\n\n1139\n01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:35,450\nIntegration services, what this guy does\nhere is it allows more functionality for\n\n1140\n01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:40,830\nthis VM to communicate with\nthe host operating system.\n\n1141\n01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:45,890\nThings like shutdown, so we had that\nshut down on our right-click menu.\n\n1142\n01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:50,180\nIf we didn't have any kind of integration\nservices set up, then the host OS could\n\n1143\n01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:57,160\nnot send that signal to the guest OS\nto say, hey, go ahead and shut down.\n\n1144\n01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,350\nThose things there.\n\n1145\n01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,080\nYeah.\n\n1146\n01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,750\n>> Some of this stuff is really important,\n\n1147\n01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,980\ndepending on the actual virtual\nmachine that you're doing here.\n\n1148\n01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,195\nIn Windows Server 2012, right?\n\n1149\n01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:10,230\nThey actually have a special\nbus that's designed just for\n\n1150\n01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:13,980\nthe VMs so they can access some of\nthe hardware a little bit faster by using\n\n1151\n01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,130\nwhat they call a VM bus here.\n\n1152\n01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:20,020\nSo if you don't have these integration\nfeatures built into the operating system,\n\n1153\n01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,715\nwell that means you have to install\nthem so that they can access.\n\n1154\n01:01:22,715 --> 01:01:25,180\nNow not every operating\nsystem can do that, but\n\n1155\n01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,330\nthe ones like in Windows 8.1 and\nWindows Server 2012,\n\n1156\n01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:31,920\nit gives them faster access to be able\nto use some of the native built-in\n\n1157\n01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,360\nthings like the network adapter\nthat's not a legacy adapter.\n\n1158\n01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,300\nIt allows them to go to communicate\na little bit quicker, a little bit more\n\n1159\n01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,980\nefficient in the way that Windows Server\n2012 Hyper-V wants them to be able to do.\n\n1160\n01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,610\nSo you wanna make sure that\nthose things are enabled.\n\n1161\n01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:47,760\nA lot of times, if you have a VM and it's\nnot functioning the way that you think\n\n1162\n01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,020\nit's gonna function or needs to function,\nby inserting in these integration services\n\n1163\n01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:56,880\nonce you have the VM booted up, you again\njust add it in as an ISO and install it.\n\n1164\n01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,880\nYou should reboot the computer, and\n\n1165\n01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,530\nyou should actually have\nthose services added in.\n\n1166\n01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:04,070\nExpands out all these functionalities\nNate just also mentioned too.\n\n1167\n01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:09,619\n>> And you know Ronnie, as far as\ninstalling those integration services.\n\n1168\n01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,980\nLet's go ahead and connect this guy,\nand start this guy up.\n\n1169\n01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:14,620\nSo we'll go ahead and.\n\n1170\n01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:17,270\n[LAUGH]\n>> Did you\n\n1171\n01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:18,345\njust boot to the-\n>> Yeah, I did.\n\n1172\n01:02:18,345 --> 01:02:20,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n1173\n01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,470\njust turn this guy off.\n\n1174\n01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:23,340\nLet's just try that over again.\n\n1175\n01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:23,840\n>> All right.\n\n1176\n01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,580\n>> And you know what we could do is just,\nwe could eject that DVD so\n\n1177\n01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,655\nthat it's not even in there.\n\n1178\n01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna do that.\n\n1179\n01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,870\nLet's go into our settings and\nour DVD drive.\n\n1180\n01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:39,730\nNow, I guess, let's see.\n\n1181\n01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:42,520\nDVD drive, none, apply, so\n\n1182\n01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:46,480\nthis is one of the settings that we can\nchange while the machine is running.\n\n1183\n01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,440\nIt's like in a physical PC,\nwe can eject out that DVD.\n\n1184\n01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,860\nSo there we go.\nSo we just ejected it.\n\n1185\n01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,020\nNow we won't run into that guy anymore.\n\n1186\n01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,530\nYou know what,\n\n1187\n01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:01,450\nI'm just gonna bump this down a little\nbit so we don't run into that again.\n\n1188\n01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:02,400\nLet's, there we go.\n\n1189\n01:03:10,376 --> 01:03:14,715\n>> And so as Nathan logs in here, we're\ngonna actually see how we would normally\n\n1190\n01:03:14,715 --> 01:03:19,290\ninstall the virtual machine integration\nservices inside of the Hyper-V here.\n\n1191\n01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:22,900\nNow on the newer operating systems,\nespecially in Windows operating systems,\n\n1192\n01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,790\nwith Windows Server 2012 and\nWindows 8.1 and\n\n1193\n01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:30,600\nWindows 8 you're gonna see that these\nservices are already integrated here.\n\n1194\n01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,170\nSo all we have to do is go up to the\naction menu, and you should see the very\n\n1195\n01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:38,150\nlast option there that says, insert\nthe integration services setup disk.\n\n1196\n01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:42,743\nAnd I think we're gonna actually\nsee that it's gonna say, hey,\n\n1197\n01:03:42,743 --> 01:03:45,384\nthese have already been included\ninto the operating system.\n\n1198\n01:03:45,384 --> 01:03:47,710\nIn a moment once we actually run this,\nwe can try though.\n\n1199\n01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:52,798\nAll right, so there's on that DVD drive.\n\n1200\n01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:55,540\nWe just double-click on that,\nand fire it up.\n\n1201\n01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,020\nAnd now it says that this computer's\nalready running the current version of\n\n1202\n01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,160\nintegration services.\n\n1203\n01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,470\nI mean, this is Windows 8.1.\n\n1204\n01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,100\nSo it does have all the latest stuff.\n\n1205\n01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,779\nIf we're trying to run Windows XP,\nWindows 7,\n\n1206\n01:04:06,779 --> 01:04:10,830\nthen you go ahead and\ninstall those guys right there.\n\n1207\n01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:13,450\nBut that is how I always stick those in.\n\n1208\n01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,350\n>> And\nyou do wanna make sure this is up to date.\n\n1209\n01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:19,360\nSo as your Hyper-V updates and\neverything else.\n\n1210\n01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,730\nA lot of times you do wanna make sure that\nit does update with the newer integration\n\n1211\n01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:27,010\nservices tool to keep everything\nrunning the way that we want it.\n\n1212\n01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,750\n>> All right, so let's go ahead and\nclose that guy out.\n\n1213\n01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,470\nLet's just jump back into.\n\n1214\n01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:31,870\nAll right, here we are.\n\n1215\n01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,360\nSo our checkpoint files location.\n\n1216\n01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:41,490\nSo we did talk about checkpoints earlier\nand how we can use our checkpoints to,\n\n1217\n01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:46,030\nkinda, save the current state and\nconfiguration of our virtual machines.\n\n1218\n01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:49,170\nWhat we can do to create\nthose checkpoints.\n\n1219\n01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:54,030\nWe can just right-click on our virtual\nmachine, and select Checkpoint.\n\n1220\n01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,350\nAnd there we go, just like that.\n\n1221\n01:04:57,350 --> 01:05:00,570\n>> So let's remind everybody\nwhat the checkpoint does, Nate.\n\n1222\n01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,540\n>> So what this checkpoint does,\n\n1223\n01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:06,940\nis it saves the current state\nof this virtual machine.\n\n1224\n01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:12,030\nSo if it is turned off, and\nwe create a checkpoint, and we revert, or\n\n1225\n01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:16,210\nwe apply this checkpoint, then\nthe virtual machine will be turned off.\n\n1226\n01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:19,590\nIf we create the checkpoint while\nthe virtual machine is running, and\n\n1227\n01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:24,480\nwe shut down this virtual machine,\nand we choose to apply the checkpoint,\n\n1228\n01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,170\nafter it is done applying\nit will be turned back on.\n\n1229\n01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:33,970\nIt is whatever state that machine is\nin when we create that checkpoint.\n\n1230\n01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:38,270\nSo on this let's see,\nthis other one over here we have running.\n\n1231\n01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:40,345\nSo if we want to create a checkpoint for\nthis one.\n\n1232\n01:05:40,345 --> 01:05:44,530\nRight-click on this guy and\nwe click on Checkpoint.\n\n1233\n01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,940\nAnd now it is creating that checkpoint.\n\n1234\n01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:52,620\nIt's saving the state for it and\nit should appear in here when it is done.\n\n1235\n01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,600\nNow once it is in there.\n\n1236\n01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,110\nThere we go.\n\n1237\n01:05:57,110 --> 01:06:00,190\nSo we can right-click and rename.\n\n1238\n01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,840\nWe'll just call this one BASE.\n\n1239\n01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:07,170\nSo if we ever need to return,\nwe can return to its base configuration or\n\n1240\n01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:10,690\nwhichever else that we choose to name it.\n\n1241\n01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:13,590\n>> Now,\nin a testing environment you may add in so\n\n1242\n01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:17,140\nmany configurations and you don't\nknow what it is that you messed up.\n\n1243\n01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,470\nSo what you can do at the beginning here,\n\n1244\n01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:22,718\nif we were running this\nmaybe in client Hyper-V.\n\n1245\n01:06:22,718 --> 01:06:25,860\nWe would go and set a checkpoint up at\nthe beginning before we actually do any\n\n1246\n01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:30,110\ninstalls and then we create all of\nthe different things that we need to.\n\n1247\n01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:33,500\nAt that point if we did mess something up,\nwe actually now can roll it back without\n\n1248\n01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,500\nhaving to reinstall everything and\ntry and start back over.\n\n1249\n01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,300\nSo this really is a good option for us.\n\n1250\n01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,910\n>> Now one thing to keep\nmind of with checkpoints.\n\n1251\n01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:48,120\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe can shut this machine down.\n\n1252\n01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:48,870\nAnd we'll just turn off.\n\n1253\n01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:50,090\nWe'll just yank the power.\n\n1254\n01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,220\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1255\n01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,338\n>> All right, so now it wouldn't see, but\n\n1256\n01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:56,730\nnow it's okay cuz now we have\na checkpoint that we can revert to.\n\n1257\n01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:58,940\nNow let's say we can go in there.\n\n1258\n01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:01,460\nAnd so here are our VHDs.\n\n1259\n01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,060\nSo there is the VHD that\nwe're working with right now.\n\n1260\n01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:08,830\nIt's grown to just about 8.5 GB.\n\n1261\n01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:10,350\nAnd here's this file right here.\n\n1262\n01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:13,920\nWell this file is our checkpoint file.\n\n1263\n01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,880\nSo all the changes that we make to this\nvirtual machine, since that checkpoint.\n\n1264\n01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,550\nWill be made inside this file right here.\n\n1265\n01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:28,083\nNow one thing to keep in mind here,\nwhen you do have checkpoints,\n\n1266\n01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:31,115\nyou cannot do anything here with this VHD.\n\n1267\n01:07:31,115 --> 01:07:32,815\nYou cannot browse into it.\n\n1268\n01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:37,065\nNow sometimes,\nif I want to transfer a large file, or\n\n1269\n01:07:37,065 --> 01:07:39,802\na bunch of files into a VHD.\n\n1270\n01:07:39,802 --> 01:07:43,275\nYou know, you can just double-click on it,\nopen it up.\n\n1271\n01:07:43,275 --> 01:07:47,121\nAnd so now I can browse into it and\nthere's the profile in there for and\n\n1272\n01:07:47,121 --> 01:07:51,892\nI can browse into it, and I can go and\nremove things and take stuff out.\n\n1273\n01:07:51,892 --> 01:07:58,541\nAll right, well doing it that way,\nwe have now broken the chain.\n\n1274\n01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:01,211\nBroken the chain of trust.\n\n1275\n01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:03,731\nI'm not sure if that's what\nexactly what it calls it.\n\n1276\n01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:05,521\nBut now we've essentially broken that VHD.\n\n1277\n01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:08,321\nSo even though we have this checkpoint,\n\n1278\n01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:11,331\nif we choose to start\nthis virtual machine now,\n\n1279\n01:08:13,901 --> 01:08:18,430\nit'll throw up an error saying whoa, hey,\nyou know, fail to open something up.\n\n1280\n01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:24,250\nAnd from my reading before in the past,\nbecause I've accidentally done this,\n\n1281\n01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,580\nthat's how I've found\nout about this error.\n\n1282\n01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,540\nThere really is no way to correct this.\n\n1283\n01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:33,218\nYou've essentially lost that VHD and\neverything in there.\n\n1284\n01:08:33,218 --> 01:08:34,635\nNow, of course,\n\n1285\n01:08:34,635 --> 01:08:40,119\nthere could be something here somebody\nfound a way to get through it.\n\n1286\n01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:42,940\nActually that one there, oh,\nthat's right because it's still mounted.\n\n1287\n01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,166\nThat wasn't the error I was thinking.\n\n1288\n01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:48,290\nAll right, let's go ahead and eject that.\n\n1289\n01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,452\n>> There you go.\n\n1290\n01:08:56,452 --> 01:08:59,690\n>> All right, so\nnow we get a different one.\n\n1291\n01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:04,520\nFail to power on,\nthe chain of virtual disks is corrupted.\n\n1292\n01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,120\nThere's a mismatch of identifiers.\n\n1293\n01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:08,720\nSo, that's it.\n\n1294\n01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,263\nThere's really no going\nback at that point.\n\n1295\n01:09:11,263 --> 01:09:17,473\nSo, if you create any checkpoints and\nyou want to browse that VHD, don't.\n\n1296\n01:09:17,473 --> 01:09:20,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there we go.\n\n1297\n01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:23,000\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, let's jump back into\n\n1298\n01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:28,850\nthis guy and see, where were we at?\n\n1299\n01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:29,830\nOh yeah, in the settings.\n\n1300\n01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:31,185\n>> Yep.\n\n1301\n01:09:31,185 --> 01:09:32,535\n>> All right, so\nthere are the checkpoints,\n\n1302\n01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:35,345\nwe can change where those\ncheckpoints are created.\n\n1303\n01:09:37,285 --> 01:09:38,875\nSmart Paging File Location.\n\n1304\n01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:43,987\nSo, we do have dynamic memory\non these virtual machines.\n\n1305\n01:09:43,987 --> 01:09:45,797\nSo when they start up.\n\n1306\n01:09:45,797 --> 01:09:50,697\nSo this guy, when he starts up,\nit needs 2 GB of memory.\n\n1307\n01:09:50,697 --> 01:09:53,237\nWell, it's dynamic, so\nafter it settles back down,\n\n1308\n01:09:53,237 --> 01:09:59,033\nit could settle down to as\nlow as 512 MB of memory.\n\n1309\n01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:03,433\nSo today we have a bunch of machines and\nthey've been running for awhile.\n\n1310\n01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:06,243\nAnd so now we need to shut one down for\none reason or another.\n\n1311\n01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:07,483\nWe shut it down.\n\n1312\n01:10:07,483 --> 01:10:11,740\nWell as it spins back up,\nlet's say there is no memory available.\n\n1313\n01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:19,500\nYou cannot get this 2 GB of memory\nfrom the host operating system.\n\n1314\n01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,070\nWell, what is he going to do?\n\n1315\n01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:24,990\nIf it's a critical machine,\nwe need that guy to spin back up.\n\n1316\n01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:28,720\nNo, if we set up our weight and\n\n1317\n01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:34,400\nour priority, then perhaps it could kind\nof steal memory from another machine or\n\n1318\n01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,770\nanother machine could\nrelease some of its memory.\n\n1319\n01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:42,930\nIf there is none left to give,\nwe've got this smart paging file.\n\n1320\n01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:46,482\nAnd what this does is it will allow\nthis virtual machine just to start up.\n\n1321\n01:10:46,482 --> 01:10:50,120\nIt will create a file to allow\nthis guy to spin up, and\n\n1322\n01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:54,900\nMicrosoft has a ten minute max time for\nthis virtual machine.\n\n1323\n01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,290\nIf it can't spin up, and\n\n1324\n01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:02,230\nsettle down to the amount of RAM that\nit has available, it's gonna fail.\n\n1325\n01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:05,010\nSo it can use this smart paging file\n\n1326\n01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:05,930\njust to-\n>> As RAM?\n\n1327\n01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:06,681\n>> Yep, as RAM.\n\n1328\n01:11:06,681 --> 01:11:07,794\nJust to spin up.\n\n1329\n01:11:07,794 --> 01:11:11,180\n>> Sounds great.\n\n1330\n01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:15,670\n>> And down below here,\nwe have the automatic actions, so\n\n1331\n01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:18,790\nwhenever the host OS, right?\n\n1332\n01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:22,750\nSo whatever is running the Hyper-V server,\n\n1333\n01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,890\nwhen it spins up, what's it gonna\ndo with those virtual machines?\n\n1334\n01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:30,880\nWell, it could do nothing or it can\nstart up in whatever state it was when\n\n1335\n01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,480\nthe host OS stopped or it can always\nstart up the machine automatically.\n\n1336\n01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:39,666\nSo if a domain controller or\na file server, or\n\n1337\n01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:44,241\nsomething that we want to always\nhave running, like a torrent server,\n\n1338\n01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:46,775\nsomething like that we always want up.\n\n1339\n01:11:46,775 --> 01:11:51,172\nWe can click this here to always\nstart this machine Automatically.\n\n1340\n01:11:51,172 --> 01:11:51,751\n>> Right.\n\n1341\n01:11:51,751 --> 01:11:55,533\n>> Now, if we have a bunch of virtual\nmachines we want to make sure are always\n\n1342\n01:11:55,533 --> 01:11:59,880\nrunning, we can set up a delay here, try\nto limit that initial surge of resources.\n\n1343\n01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:03,350\nNow let's say, like on.\n\n1344\n01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:05,500\nI yanked the power on that last one.\n\n1345\n01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,300\nSo let's say that we do have some\nvirtual machines running, and\n\n1346\n01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,370\nI need to shut down my host OS.\n\n1347\n01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:15,030\nSo let's say that this survey here,\nit's running.\n\n1348\n01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,770\nWe'll just go ahead and start it back up.\n\n1349\n01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:22,530\nAnd this guy is running but on a nosed OS.\n\n1350\n01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:24,210\nWe need to shut it down, or\n\n1351\n01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:29,080\nwe need to restart for updates or\nmaintenance or who knows what.\n\n1352\n01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,730\nWell, this setting here defines what\nhappens to that virtual machine when we\n\n1353\n01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:35,940\nperform that action.\n\n1354\n01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:38,161\nSo right, so by default save the state.\n\n1355\n01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:40,720\nRight?\nSo just kind of park it.\n\n1356\n01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,465\nHibernate it.\n\n1357\n01:12:41,465 --> 01:12:46,220\nJust keep it there, and then when the host\nOS starts back up, what do you do?\n\n1358\n01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,760\nWell, just return it back to where it was.\n\n1359\n01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,010\nWe can just turn off the virtual machine.\n\n1360\n01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:55,370\nWe can just yank its power straight out,\nor\n\n1361\n01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:58,045\nwe can gracefully shut the guest OS down.\n\n1362\n01:12:58,045 --> 01:13:02,875\nNow depending on whatever services or\nthings are running on that guest OS,\n\n1363\n01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:07,175\nthey're all gonna have to\nshut down gracefully for\n\n1364\n01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:10,050\nthat host OS to finish its shut down, so\n\n1365\n01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:12,820\nI guess depending on what's going\non it could take a little while.\n\n1366\n01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:13,688\n>> Sure enough.\n\n1367\n01:13:13,688 --> 01:13:18,630\n>> Alright Ronnie, so those\nare the items there in the management.\n\n1368\n01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:22,100\nIs there anything in there jumping out?\n\n1369\n01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,490\n>> I don't think so.\nI think we've covered just about\n\n1370\n01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:27,400\neverything in that list there, so\nI think we've done pretty good.\n\n1371\n01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,190\n>> So remember that in terms\nof the settings, right?\n\n1372\n01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:32,560\nYou actually have the overall Hyper-V\nmanagement that we took a look\n\n1373\n01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,230\nat at the beginning of our episode here.\n\n1374\n01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:40,460\nAnd then we also have the idea of\ntaking a look at the individual VM.\n\n1375\n01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,080\nOkay?\n\n1376\n01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,850\nSo, each VM that you have actually will\nhave separate settings that you can adjust\n\n1377\n01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:48,180\nand change depending on your need for\nthat particular VM.\n\n1378\n01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:50,630\nWhether you need it to automatically\nstart up or shut down.\n\n1379\n01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:55,270\nWhether you need to assign it more RAM or\nagain even more processors that you have.\n\n1380\n01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,330\nYou have that ability to do so\n\n1381\n01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:00,175\nby being able to do this inside\nthe virtualization technology.\n\n1382\n01:14:00,175 --> 01:14:03,510\nThat really does help cuz now you can\nactually adjust the machines the way that\n\n1383\n01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:06,373\nyou want, and they can service your\nnetwork however you want them to.\n\n1384\n01:14:06,373 --> 01:14:10,014\nAnd you're actually using more of\nthe hardware than you would've before.\n\n1385\n01:14:10,014 --> 01:14:10,518\nOkay?\n\n1386\n01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:11,272\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1387\n01:14:11,272 --> 01:14:12,280\n>> All right.\n\n1388\n01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,290\n>> All right.\n\n1389\n01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:19,460\nOne thing I guess left that\nwe should mention, right?\n\n1390\n01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:22,770\nImporting and exporting virtual machines.\n\n1391\n01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:27,790\nIf you take a virtual machine and\njust try to straight up copy that guy and\n\n1392\n01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:31,210\nrestore it that way,\nchances are there's gonna be some file,\n\n1393\n01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:34,430\nthere's gonna be something missing\nfrom that virtual machine.\n\n1394\n01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:42,250\nSo, if you need to transfer a virtual\nmachine, the import virtual machine?\n\n1395\n01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:42,950\nThat is a way to do it.\n\n1396\n01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:48,460\nSo after the machine is exported,\nimporting it in this guy will do it and\n\n1397\n01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,640\nkeep it from, yeah,\ngetting broken in the process.\n\n1398\n01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,210\n>> Right.\n\n1399\n01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:52,710\nYeah.\n\n1400\n01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,300\n>> All right, Ronnie, let's see.\n\n1401\n01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:57,610\nI think that is just about.\n\n1402\n01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,950\nYeah, goodness.\n\n1403\n01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:02,030\nAfter that,\nthat's about all I've got on Hyper-V.\n\n1404\n01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:05,075\n>> All right.\n>> Yeah, well all right.\n\n1405\n01:15:05,075 --> 01:15:08,780\nWell, if you ever have any\nquestions during the

right, welcome back,\nanother fantastic episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:39,953\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:41,275\n>> How's it going Nathan?\n\n7\n00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,750\n>> Yeah, pretty good Ronnie, pretty good.\n\n8\n00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,019\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pretty good this morning,\n\n9\n00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:45,150\nit's a nice morning out.\n\n10\n00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,728\n>> It is beautiful.\n\n11\n00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:52,470\n>> It was no rain, no fog,\nno, I don't know, stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,340\nThe sun was out.\n\n13\n00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,010\n>> Yeah, so it's now time for\nus to continue on to\n\n14\n00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,990\nthe idea of taking a look at our\nlast little section here on Hyper-V,\n\n15\n00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,970\nwhich is talking about the idea\nof monitoring our performance\n\n16\n00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,170\non our Hyper-V server,\nas well as the idea of updating too.\n\n17\n00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,590\nOkay, so that is the issues\nthat we're actually going to\n\n18\n00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,600\nwhen we start taking a look at\nsome of the issues here, right.\n\n19\n00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,095\nSo throughout this series, right,\n\n20\n00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:21,515\nwe've introduced the concept\nof what virtualization is.\n\n21\n00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,364\nWe've talked about the main\nproduct that we've been using,\n\n22\n00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:25,803\nwhich is the idea of Hyper-V.\n\n23\n00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:29,558\nWe showed an install of course, how we\nactually make sure that Hyper-V is up and\n\n24\n00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:30,470\nrunning.\n\n25\n00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,715\nWe took a look at the interface,\nwe created virtual machines.\n\n26\n00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:37,718\nWe walked through some of the ways you\ncan actually improve the virtual machine\n\n27\n00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:41,658\nperformance as well, and pretty much\ndid just about everything, except for\n\n28\n00:01:41,658 --> 00:01:43,733\nthis last full section, right, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:48,695\nSo a lot of times when we start taking\na look at the idea of using something\n\n30\n00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:50,370\nlike Hyper-V, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,160\nWhen we start using more and\nmore hardware,\n\n32\n00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,830\nokay, the problem that we're going to\nend up running into at some point, Nate,\n\n33\n00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,210\nis if I create too many virtual machines\nand I'll have them up and running.\n\n34\n00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,190\nWhat is actually gonna end\nup happening at times, Nate?\n\n35\n00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,167\n>> Well I guess depending on the, I guess\nwhat resources you have available on\n\n36\n00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:14,128\nyour host VM, you could run\ninto some performance issues.\n\n37\n00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:16,158\nRight, is that where you're coming?\n\n38\n00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:17,076\n>> That's true.\n\n39\n00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:18,863\n>> [CROSSTALK] Some\nperformance bottlenecks.\n\n40\n00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:22,663\nMaybe your hardware resources\nare getting taxed, and your VMs,\n\n41\n00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:25,357\nthe performance is starting to slow down,\nand\n\n42\n00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:28,759\nit's not quite what it used to\nbe when it was a brand new VM.\n\n43\n00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,465\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n44\n00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:32,485\n>> One out of five is what I hear.\n\n45\n00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,519\nThat's the statistic.\n\n46\n00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,412\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That what we talk about all\n\n47\n00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:38,480\nthe time?\n\n48\n00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,450\nBut yeah, you shouldn't have\ndid it like that, that's it.\n\n49\n00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,080\nBut yeah,\nthere will be performance issues right?\n\n50\n00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,340\nBecause what are we doing?\n\n51\n00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,639\nWe're optimizing use of hardware, and\nso when we start actually going, right,\n\n52\n00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,255\nremember that the statistic that we\nbrought up right at the beginning\n\n53\n00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:58,365\nof the series here is that most of the\ntime people really only use about 20% of\n\n54\n00:02:58,365 --> 00:02:59,586\nthe hardware, okay.\n\n55\n00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:03,760\nAnd so when we are running just a regular,\nphysical machine, that is no big deal.\n\n56\n00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,390\nWhen we do need the actual\nperformance on that machine to\n\n57\n00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,860\nramp up because we are running more and\n\n58\n00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,730\nmore programs, we are doing everything\nthat we possibly can to help.\n\n59\n00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,140\nWe have that essential\ncushion that we can go up to.\n\n60\n00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,380\nBut now if I actually am maxing out let's\nsay just about as much RAM as I have, and\n\n61\n00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,790\nnow I've got multiple machines running.\n\n62\n00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,801\nEach one of those machines is now,\nour virtual machines,\n\n63\n00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:28,265\nis going to take up\na portion of that processor.\n\n64\n00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:30,529\nIt's gonna also take up a bit of that RAM,\n\n65\n00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:33,894\nas well as the hard drive space,\nand that now means we are going\n\n66\n00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:37,880\nto be running into the issues that\nNate was really addressing here.\n\n67\n00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,658\nAt least I hope that's what he was talking\nabout when we started to take a look.\n\n68\n00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:42,563\n>> Yes, that's correct.\n\n69\n00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:47,765\nNow, we do have a number of\ndifferent avenues that we can\n\n70\n00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:53,980\nuse to monitor performance [LAUGH]\non the VM as well as on the host VM.\n\n71\n00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,590\n>> Right.\n\n72\n00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,210\n>> Now, so yeah, monitoring it both ways.\n\n73\n00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,370\nNow, you know we do have good old Task\nManager, of course those sorts of things.\n\n74\n00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,240\nBut let's say we're on\nour [LAUGH] host VM and\n\n75\n00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,560\nwe want to monitor our\nperformance across everything.\n\n76\n00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,060\n>> Yeah.\n\n77\n00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,746\n>> We've got now, so yeah, so Ronnie, so\n\n78\n00:04:12,746 --> 00:04:17,038\nthere is a performance monitor that\nwe can use to add some counters and\n\n79\n00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:20,384\nthose deals, right, for those VMs,\n>> Right, yeah, for\n\n80\n00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:24,419\nus here in terms of the performance,\nit really kinda varies depending on how we\n\n81\n00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,180\nhave everything set up in\nour virtualized environment.\n\n82\n00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,731\nThe environment that Nate and\n\n83\n00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:33,790\nI have been using throughout this\nseries is a standalone Hyper-V machine.\n\n84\n00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,000\nIn other words, just a one server\nrunning the Hyper-V role here,\n\n85\n00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,540\nadding in virtual machines\nin that environment.\n\n86\n00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,300\nNow in that particular environment,\n\n87\n00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,410\nas a standalone machine, we have to\nagain worry about the same things\n\n88\n00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,970\nthat we would normally worry about on\nthat particular one machine, all right?\n\n89\n00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,910\nWe have to worry about\nthe idea of failure, right?\n\n90\n00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,450\nPower outages, all the different\nthings that we actually have to do,\n\n91\n00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,170\nbut as well as the idea of handling\nthe performance so that if we are running\n\n92\n00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,927\nother Windows Server 2012 virtual machines\nto handle our networking environment here.\n\n93\n00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:08,970\nWe've got to actually realize, okay,\nthat some performance issues may hit.\n\n94\n00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,963\nAnd so one of the things we have to do is\nbe able to monitor how well our standalone\n\n95\n00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,712\nHyper-V server is doing.\n\n96\n00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:18,540\nAnd so there's many different\nways we can do it, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,933\nWe can go from the idea like free all\nthe way to the idea of incredibly\n\n98\n00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,923\nexpensive here,\nis what we can actually do.\n\n99\n00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:28,163\nSo depending on your\nparticular level of need,\n\n100\n00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:31,527\nat the very beginning we're going to\nkind of show you kind of the gamut.\n\n101\n00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:35,487\nWe're not gonna go through every\nsingle step, but we'll show you some\n\n102\n00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:39,123\nof the things we can do as well, and\nso we should be able to do this.\n\n103\n00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:41,360\nSo, let's start with what's built in.\n\n104\n00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,080\nWhat do you think, Nate?\n\n105\n00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,720\nIs that a good place for\nus to start off with?\n\n106\n00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,610\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, I think so.\n\n107\n00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,680\n>> Yeah, so let's go ahead and\n\n108\n00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,930\nstart off with the idea of what's built\ninto Windows Server 2012 to help us.\n\n109\n00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,710\nSo, on my machine here I've gotten\nmy 2012 Server up and running, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:03,270\nAnd this is actually the one, I've stolen\nNate's VM host machine here to show you.\n\n111\n00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,650\nSo we actually have a couple of\ndifferent client machines going.\n\n112\n00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,776\nSo there's a domain controller you\ncan actually see that's running in\n\n113\n00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:11,563\nthe background.\n\n114\n00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:14,544\nThere is this Win 8,\na Windows 8 client, and\n\n115\n00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:20,180\nI also have a Windows 7 client running on\nthis particular VM host right now, too.\n\n116\n00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,640\nSo here's Hyper-V running and\neverything that we need to.\n\n117\n00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,000\nSo the basic performance\ntools that we can look at,\n\n118\n00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,960\nif I'm really only worried about\nmonitoring the overall health, or\n\n119\n00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,070\nat least having an overview of\nthe overall health of the computer.\n\n120\n00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,850\nJust what Nate said, I can right-click and\n\n121\n00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,530\njust go simply to Task Manager and\nI can take a look at it right here.\n\n122\n00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,371\nSo if I take a look at it right here,\n\n123\n00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:49,076\nnotice I have the Performance tab,\nwhich is right here available to us, and\n\n124\n00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,918\nI can see the memory usage at\nthis point is right about 60%.\n\n125\n00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,600\nI can see the CPU usage is not much,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n126\n00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,960\nSo now I'm just looking at the overall,\n\n127\n00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,940\njust saying this particular machine,\nno real big deal.\n\n128\n00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,087\nBut remember,\nif I were to turn on all these machines,\n\n129\n00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:06,733\nI couldn't cuz I don't have enough RAM.\n\n130\n00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:09,350\nBut it would actually begin\nto eat up a little bit more.\n\n131\n00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,750\nWell, how do I monitor each and\nevery individual machine?\n\n132\n00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,743\nWell Nate, we could go into each VM,\nright, and do the same thing.\n\n133\n00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:20,515\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nit is possible that, I mean,\n\n134\n00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:25,430\nif you don't have a bunch of VMs and\nyeah, and that could take a bit of time.\n\n135\n00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,740\n>> Yeah,\nit could take a tremendous amount of time.\n\n136\n00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,290\nBut yeah that that doesn't actually\ngive us an overall total picture of\n\n137\n00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,800\neverything that we can do.\n\n138\n00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,244\nWe're just gonna take one instance here.\n\n139\n00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:36,870\nWe're gonna take a look at the CPU,\nbecause that's the one\n\n140\n00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,900\nthat we're really gonna see a lot\nof issues with, if anything else.\n\n141\n00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,509\nBut the good thing is, the built in tool\nthat we have available here in terms\n\n142\n00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:47,547\nof monitoring is that good old perfmon,\nor performance monitoring tool, right?\n\n143\n00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:51,527\nYeah, and this gives us the ability\nto actually create a whole bunch of\n\n144\n00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:53,561\ndifferent ways that we can do this.\n\n145\n00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:57,421\n>> Yeah, while you fire that up,\nthat performance monitor,\n\n146\n00:07:57,421 --> 00:08:00,828\nif you haven't jumped in\nthere It is a amazing tool.\n\n147\n00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:04,620\nIt can be a bit complex to look at.\n\n148\n00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,820\nSee as Ronnie just typed\nin a performance there.\n\n149\n00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,050\nIn the star screen there,\nto pull up the old performance monitor.\n\n150\n00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,140\nAnd on the surface,\nit can look a bit busy of a program.\n\n151\n00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,720\nSo Ronnie click right there\non performance monitor\n\n152\n00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,630\nin that little button right there, yep.\n\n153\n00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,660\nSo this right here is a real time\n\n154\n00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,170\na real time graph of what is\ncurrently going on in our systems.\n\n155\n00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,890\nNow right here,\nnot really a whole lot to look at,\n\n156\n00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,110\nespecially to see the health of our\nindividual VMs, but we can add specific\n\n157\n00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,630\ncounters, or\nwe can add specific just units of things,\n\n158\n00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,200\nI guess, inside of our computer\nthat we can monitor and measure.\n\n159\n00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,875\nAnd, lucky for us, there are some Hyper-V\ncounters that we can add in here as well.\n\n160\n00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,120\n>> Yeah,\nbecause we are running Hyper-V, and\n\n161\n00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,240\nwe may want to actually be able\nto compare the overall health or\n\n162\n00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,470\noverall monitoring or performance of\nthe CPU, versus the way that the actual\n\n163\n00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,260\nindividual machines see it, we're\ngonna see some of these counters here.\n\n164\n00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,160\nThe easiest way to add in a counter\ninto the performance monitor\n\n165\n00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,160\nis by coming here inside of this\nparticular graph that we see, and\n\n166\n00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,300\nthis big green plus sign at\nthe top here where it says Add.\n\n167\n00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,381\nIf I click on that,\nit gives me all of the different counters\n\n168\n00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:27,784\nthat are actually available\ninside of Windows Server 2012.\n\n169\n00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:30,145\nAnd if I scroll up in alphabetical order,\n\n170\n00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:34,203\nI'm gonna see all of these different\ntools that are available, okay.\n\n171\n00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:38,610\nThere is that dynamic memory\nintegration service for us.\n\n172\n00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,190\nIn other words,\n\n173\n00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,410\nthe adjustable memory that's actually\navailable to the VMs for us here.\n\n174\n00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,290\nAnd we have also\nthe dynamic memory monitor.\n\n175\n00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,582\nWe're not so worried about that,\nwe're really focusing in on the idea of\n\n176\n00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:52,050\nthe processing units,\nthat processor is what we're doing.\n\n177\n00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,570\nNow if I scroll down here,\n\n178\n00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,690\nthere's a couple of different ones\nthat are actually available, okay.\n\n179\n00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,430\nThere is what we call\nthe logical processor, okay.\n\n180\n00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,890\nNow, the logical processor is\nthe software representation\n\n181\n00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,670\nof my physical processor on\nthis particular computer, okay.\n\n182\n00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,200\nSo they actually show us the core here,\nright.\n\n183\n00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,280\nSo here's the first of\nthis dual core processor.\n\n184\n00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,810\nHere's the second core of that core dual\nprocessor, that's running on this machine.\n\n185\n00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,746\nNow if I want to take a look at\nthe loads between them I could, but\n\n186\n00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:27,114\nthe only ones I'd really take a look at is\nLogical processor, or LP zero here, okay.\n\n187\n00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:30,376\nThat's the one that really attempts\nto handle the majority load and then,\n\n188\n00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:33,425\nif it needs to,\nactually takes over on the second one.\n\n189\n00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,505\nThat's not the one that we're\nreally looking at at this point.\n\n190\n00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,137\nThe one that we want is\nactually under the our\n\n191\n00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:45,720\nHyper-V Hypervisor Virtual Processor here,\nokay?\n\n192\n00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,350\nSo this is when you and\nI can actually say,\n\n193\n00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,130\nall right, how does each machine take\nadvantage of the processor here?\n\n194\n00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,190\nAnd notice I can actually select the total\nprocessor and I can add that in it, and\n\n195\n00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,880\nthat's gonna give me an overall summary\nof what I'm doing here, and then I can\n\n196\n00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,040\nselect each of the virtual machines, and\nyou can see them down here on the object.\n\n197\n00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,640\nSo here's the one for\nthe domain controller, here's the one for\n\n198\n00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,630\nthe Windows 8.1 client that I have,\nand here's the one for the Windows 7.\n\n199\n00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,239\nNow I'm adding in everything.\n\n200\n00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:21,244\nThis may make it take a little bit junky\nhere, but we can actually do that and\n\n201\n00:11:21,244 --> 00:11:23,760\ntake a look at it in the real screen here.\n\n202\n00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,810\nAnd let's see what it does for\nus in the overall idea, okay.\n\n203\n00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,087\nSo you can see where adding-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n204\n00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:32,210\n>> In everything is just too much, okay.\n\n205\n00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,920\nSo that may be too much data for us, so\n\n206\n00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,095\nwhat we might want to do is actually again\njust kind of uncheck some of these things.\n\n207\n00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,375\nTo kind that help us out here in\n\n208\n00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,099\nterms of the-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:42,304\n>> Overall processor time.\n\n210\n00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:45,860\nBut there's a lot them, all right.\n\n211\n00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,090\n>> And\nnow Ronnie as you're adding in those CPUs,\n\n212\n00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:54,240\nI noticed that in our Hyper-V manager\nwe've got a number of VMs in there.\n\n213\n00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,290\nAnd the ones that were available\nto add their CPUs to this counter,\n\n214\n00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,010\nwere only the ones that were\ncurrently running at the time.\n\n215\n00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,555\nSo I suppose if there was a particular\nVM they're wanting to measure or\n\n216\n00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:07,077\nto monitor,\nthen it would need to be powered on and\n\n217\n00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:09,557\nrunning to add its processor\nto these counters.\n\n218\n00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:10,647\n>> Right, yep.\n\n219\n00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:15,369\n>> And Ronnie that's still, that is just\na menagerie of counters right there.\n\n220\n00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,290\n>> So we really don't want all that so\nI'm gonna close this out for a moment,\n\n221\n00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,659\nand kinda relaunch it again.\n\n222\n00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,750\nSo they other way to do\nit since we're actually,\n\n223\n00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,600\nagain, the individual time write,\nthe real time stuff\n\n224\n00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,750\ncan help us if we're actually\nworried about things like a spike.\n\n225\n00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,670\nBut a lot of times,\nwe're worried about this and\n\n226\n00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,940\nwe actually want to\ncompare it somewhere else.\n\n227\n00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,440\nSo, what we may choose to do instead\nis actually create what we call\n\n228\n00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,020\na data collector set.\n\n229\n00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,890\nSo instead of looking at everything,\n\n230\n00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,880\nwe're really gonna actually strip\nit down to what we want here.\n\n231\n00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,840\nSo if I select data collector set and\nuser defined, and\n\n232\n00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,610\nthen I can right-click and\ncreate a new data collector set, and\n\n233\n00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,030\nlet's call this one VM Processor Usage.\n\n234\n00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,650\nSo, I'm just gonna put\nthe percentage usage here.\n\n235\n00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,500\nSo, I can see which particular\nVM may be taking up the most.\n\n236\n00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,420\nI'm gonna create it manually\ninstead of creating a template.\n\n237\n00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,370\nAnd from that point I'm just gonna create\na data log on the performance counter.\n\n238\n00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,490\nI'm not gonna worry about doing the rest\nof them, I'm gonna click next here.\n\n239\n00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,595\nAnd then this time when I click on\nthat I'm gonna be a little more\n\n240\n00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:23,596\ndiscriminating\n>> [LAUGHTER]\n\n241\n00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:24,930\n>> In what I'm gonna do.\n\n242\n00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,490\nI kind of overwhelmed the senses there,\nis what I did a little bit earlier.\n\n243\n00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,990\nSo if I come back here to the virtual\nprocessor I can scroll down, and instead\n\n244\n00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,740\nof selecting everything, I'm gonna look\nfor the, we could do a couple of them.\n\n245\n00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,240\nLet's see.\n\n246\n00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:48,920\nI'm really looking for the percentage\nof usage here, maybe, if I can find it.\n\n247\n00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:53,498\n>> All right.\n\n248\n00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:57,320\n>> Let me see,\nnow let's just do the Guest Run Time here.\n\n249\n00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,985\n>> Okay, that works.\n\n250\n00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:03,225\n>> If I can get it there.\n\n251\n00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:06,958\n>> And then I guess select which\none that you're wanting to do.\n\n252\n00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,038\nAdd that guy.\n\n253\n00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:11,090\n>> Yep, and so notice this is only\npulling in one of those instead.\n\n254\n00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,957\nOops, I did that twice didn't I?\n\n255\n00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:16,058\nNo, okay.\n>> Yeah, you're good.\n\n256\n00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:19,853\n>> Nope, I just wasn't able to read.\n\n257\n00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:20,875\n>> I do that sometimes.\n\n258\n00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,375\n>> Yup.\n\n259\n00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:24,710\nSo now I have those instances there, and\n\n260\n00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,160\nnow we're not looking at\neverything all at one time.\n\n261\n00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,270\nWe're looking at just that\none that I wanted to.\n\n262\n00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,240\nIf I wanted to add another one I\ncould as well, and add that in,\n\n263\n00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,950\nbut I'm not gonna worry about it.\n\n264\n00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,330\nSo let's go ahead and click okay.\n\n265\n00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,140\nAnd then,\nnotice it's sampling every 15 seconds.\n\n266\n00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,640\nI could change that, click next,\nand it says do you want to save it?\n\n267\n00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,420\nWhere it's gonna save it.\n\n268\n00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,440\nPerfectly fine.\n\n269\n00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,640\nAnd let me go ahead and\nstart this data clip reset now.\n\n270\n00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,470\nClick Finish.\n\n271\n00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,695\nAnd it can now run, okay,\nnow this is gonna give us a summary,\n\n272\n00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:02,505\nit's gonna give us a performance,\nit's gonna do everything here.\n\n273\n00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:06,395\nIt's gonna run for a particular point\nin time, and then we can compare this,\n\n274\n00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:10,130\nover time, to other times we run\nthe data collector set, as well.\n\n275\n00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:15,944\nSo that's a nice utility for\nus that really costs nothing extra.\n\n276\n00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:21,334\n>> Yeah, and with these event collector\nsets, you can set up alarms on them too,\n\n277\n00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:25,255\nthat if there's a particular\ncounter not registering,\n\n278\n00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:29,338\nif there is something that's\ngoing above a set threshold,\n\n279\n00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:33,748\nsome kind of limit that we set,\nit can fire off some some emails or\n\n280\n00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:38,684\nnotifications, or whatever it is that\nwe set it for those alarms to do.\n\n281\n00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:43,568\nSo it as this thing just continues to\nrun and run, and sample those intervals,\n\n282\n00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:47,425\nnow if we let it run too long,\nI mean it is logging everything.\n\n283\n00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:50,675\n>> And it can be possible for\nthese logs to grow very large.\n\n284\n00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:55,147\nBut if there is a particular thing\nthat we are wanting to monitor,\n\n285\n00:15:55,147 --> 00:16:00,850\nwe can set these event collector sets to\nrun during certain areas of the time.\n\n286\n00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,570\nPerhaps if we run it so we can detect\nsome peak loads and that sort of thing.\n\n287\n00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,720\nYeah, and find trends and\nall that sort of stuff.\n\n288\n00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,410\n>> Yeah.\n\n289\n00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,580\nSo really important for us, especially if\nwe want to start monitoring this stuff,\n\n290\n00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,780\nthe more and more virtual machines that\nyou have on here, the more that you're\n\n291\n00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,690\ngonna have to do this because you may be\noverloading that particular server for us.\n\n292\n00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,550\nSo it's still running.\n\n293\n00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,510\nI'm just going to select the stop button\nat this point so we can take a look at it.\n\n294\n00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,880\nAnd give it a moment.\n\n295\n00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,670\nAnd we're going to see that it went ahead\nand created that collector set for us.\n\n296\n00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,679\nWhat's really important is down here\nunderneath where it says reports.\n\n297\n00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,680\nMaybe, if I can expand that out,\nand user defined.\n\n298\n00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,000\nAnd then I can see where\nit actually collected it.\n\n299\n00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,280\nWell about a minute apart here.\n\n300\n00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,530\nSo, here you can actually\nsee I didn't do a lot.\n\n301\n00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,658\nHere's the VM host and\nthis should now, the second one.\n\n302\n00:16:56,658 --> 00:16:58,227\nWell maybe.\n\n303\n00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm lying to you.\n\n304\n00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,320\nMaybe apparently I\nstopped it too soon here.\n\n305\n00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,730\n>> All right.\n\n306\n00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,510\n>> Yeah.\n\n307\n00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,810\nSo it says all the guest total run time,\nI probably aggregated that together.\n\n308\n00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,560\nIs what ends up happening overall.\n\n309\n00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,650\nBut again you can take advantage of some\nof those tools inside of a performance\n\n310\n00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,190\nmonitor to choose to do\nthe ones that you want to.\n\n311\n00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:23,195\nIt looks like it's running again,\nis what it's doing at some point here.\n\n312\n00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:24,730\nYeah, so it's running it again.\n\n313\n00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,685\nSo, I'm not actually going to allow\nit to run cuz I don't need to.\n\n314\n00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:29,380\nAll right.\n\n315\n00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,430\nSo there's one of the tools that's\nactually available for us that's free and\n\n316\n00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,820\nagain, with it being built right in,\ntaking a look at this, and\n\n317\n00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,000\nactually getting in there.\n\n318\n00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,370\nYou can do a lot more than just\nthe idea of the processor.\n\n319\n00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,880\nYou can look at the storage\nspace that you're doing.\n\n320\n00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,300\nTons of other things that\nare actually available.\n\n321\n00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,100\nSo a good little utility.\n\n322\n00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,300\nAbsolutely 100% free.\n\n323\n00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,730\n>> So another host here, Don Pezet,\n\n324\n00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,840\nhe mentioned this tool for\nmonitoring systems, Spotlight.\n\n325\n00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,130\nAnd so he's like, man, look and\nsee if there's a spotlight on Hyper-V.\n\n326\n00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,880\nI didn't see one, but they do have a\nreally cool tool, it's called spotlight on\n\n327\n00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,340\nWindows for monitoring systems, and\nI did install it here on my PC, and\n\n328\n00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,310\nthis spotlight on Windows, pretty neat.\n\n329\n00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,260\nWe got a little button up here that's\nkind of, oh, let me close that out.\n\n330\n00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:23,985\nKind of green or what not,\nwe can just click on it.\n\n331\n00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:24,905\n>> Oh nice.\n\n332\n00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:28,265\n>> It's got this neat\nlittle graphic stuff here.\n\n333\n00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:31,115\nIt's got little moving arrows and\n\n334\n00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:33,825\neverything is green so\nwe're all good and what not.\n\n335\n00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:35,565\nA lot of stuff on here.\n\n336\n00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:38,195\nBut once again we can set up alerts.\n\n337\n00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:43,075\nIt's kind of fun to look at like\nyou're busy and doing something.\n\n338\n00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:45,220\n>> Yeah.\nLooks pretty impressive.\n\n339\n00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,010\nYeah, a lot of information once again.\n\n340\n00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,290\nWe can be overwhelmed by\nthe amount of information.\n\n341\n00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,860\nSo this tool has the ability for\nus to kind of whittle down what we need.\n\n342\n00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,940\nProbably really the graphical report\nof it is probably actually more\n\n343\n00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,070\nbeneficial than the idea of trying\nto read an actual report and\n\n344\n00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,970\ngoing oh yes, I'm at 56% of the-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,890\n>> Usage here, and\n\n346\n00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,450\nthen trying to figure out what that means.\n\n347\n00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,080\nBeing I'll see the comparison\nas another one.\n\n348\n00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,880\nNow, are we just limited to this?\n\n349\n00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,880\nNo, there are free utilities\nout there on the internet and\n\n350\n00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,880\nI've pulled up one as I went through and\nI was looking for them.\n\n351\n00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,540\nHere ones that were essentially\nmentioned a lot of times in\n\n352\n00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,040\nthe blogs that are written about Hyper-V.\n\n353\n00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,160\nHere's one called V-M,\n\n354\n00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,380\nI think that's the way we pronounce\nit here and it's moniker here.\n\n355\n00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,495\nIt just works.\n\n356\n00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It reminds me of Apple so much.\n\n357\n00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,130\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n358\n00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,630\n>> I don't know if I would\nactually download, I'm joking.\n\n359\n00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,280\nIt actually looks like a fine product.\n\n360\n00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,410\nEverybody seems to love this thicker\nproduct, but the nice thing is,\n\n361\n00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,921\nit is free monitoring and reporting\nhere for both VMware and Hyper-V.\n\n362\n00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,610\nHyper-V is the one that\nwe're really focusing it on.\n\n363\n00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,190\nYou can download it, and\nactually on this one.\n\n364\n00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,880\nOkay.\n\n365\n00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,480\nIt doesn't actually limit you very\nmuch in terms of what you want.\n\n366\n00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,610\nNotice it gives you, now,\n\n367\n00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:00,170\nwhat it says here,\n24/7 real-time monitoring and alerting.\n\n368\n00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,460\nFor free?\n\n369\n00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,630\nThat's an incredible product, okay?\n\n370\n00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,230\nTalk about easy documentation and\nmanagement reporting.\n\n371\n00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,590\nIt's the reports that we're\nreally looking for, right?\n\n372\n00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,350\nThe ability to generate those reports so\nnot only do I\n\n373\n00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,930\nnot really have to manually worry about\nit here if it can generate it for us.\n\n374\n00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,520\nAnd then of course again all the other\nstuff that they are actually trying to do.\n\n375\n00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,850\nAnd there's a full version of course\nthat they want you to actually buy.\n\n376\n00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,100\nSo you can go from\nthe idea of free to this.\n\n377\n00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,980\nAnd there 's many other tools that\nare actually available out there.\n\n378\n00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,190\nThe free ones are generally\nwhat I stick to.\n\n379\n00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,910\nIn a standalone environment\nif I'm just testing this out,\n\n380\n00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,780\nif I'm just again, at the beginning here,\n\n381\n00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,960\nI don't want to spend thousands of\ndollars on software monitoring.\n\n382\n00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,440\nThis may be the way to go, okay?\n\n383\n00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,330\nSo that's the environment\nthat we're talking about but\n\n384\n00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,919\nNate, what if we were running\nmultiple Hyper-V servers\n\n385\n00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,150\nand I had a full-on Microsoft environment.\n\n386\n00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,040\nIs there a particular\ntool that we might use?\n\n387\n00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,200\n>> Yes.\n\n388\n00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,150\nNow, this tool, right?\n\n389\n00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,350\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n390\n00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,560\nNow Don Pezet, I believe that he is\ngeared up and antsy as can be to,\n\n391\n00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,010\nas I'm glancing over off set,\nI didn't catch attention with that.\n\n392\n00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,730\nBut he did mention that he did want to do\n\n393\n00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,820\na bit of more in depth in systems\nin a virtual machine manager.\n\n394\n00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,320\nOn my machine here I did not install it.\n\n395\n00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,850\nBut Technic has a virtual\nlab that I did fire up.\n\n396\n00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:36,215\nLet me jump on over to here, and let me\nget logged in again, cuz it went to sleep.\n\n397\n00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:41,810\n[SOUND] And that is the correct one.\n\n398\n00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,330\nAll right, so\nthe virtual machine manager is once again.\n\n399\n00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,220\nYeah, Don Pezet, he'll jump in and\nshow how the nitty-gritty but\n\n400\n00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,800\non here, we've got a couple of VMs.\n\n401\n00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,950\nI tried to fire it up real quick.\n\n402\n00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,290\nIt failed, and I'm like,\nall right, Ronnie.\n\n403\n00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,830\nWell, we just gotta show just kind of what\nit looks like to put a face with a name,\n\n404\n00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,090\nand yeah, these little VMs,\nthey didn't want to fire up.\n\n405\n00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,310\nBut, you know we can get an overview.\n\n406\n00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,420\nSo if we have multiple Hyper-V servers and\n\n407\n00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,188\nwe want to monitor the virtual\nmachines and on those hosts.\n\n408\n00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:18,950\nThat good ol' virtual machine\nmanager is the tool for us.\n\n409\n00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:25,570\nAnd in here It breaks down the performance\nand everything in a quick.\n\n410\n00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,880\nWe've got monthly hosts,\nperformance and those sorts of things.\n\n411\n00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,370\nSo, we have monitoring of the VN's and\n\n412\n00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,790\nwe can also do performance\nmetering as well.\n\n413\n00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,990\nSo, if we have performance monitoring,\n\n414\n00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,590\njust so\nwe can see what these machines are using.\n\n415\n00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,130\nAs far as performance wise,\nwe also have performance metering where\n\n416\n00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:53,000\nlets say if we're, lets say in this\ndata center we have all these VM's and\n\n417\n00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,010\nwe are renting it out or\nrenting time on our machines to clients or\n\n418\n00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,740\nto and other contractors out there,\nwhatnot.\n\n419\n00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,830\nThat we can charge.\n\n420\n00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,450\nWell, if you're using a virtual machine\nfor such and such hours of the day and\n\n421\n00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,085\nit's sitting mostly idle,\nthen we can monitor those times and\n\n422\n00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,855\nwe can charge you based on\nwhat percentage you're using.\n\n423\n00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:20,325\nBut if between those two hours\nyour machines are using a bunch of\n\n424\n00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:24,215\npower then perhaps we\ncan charge a bit more.\n\n425\n00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:27,612\nSo if performance far as monitoring and\nperformance metering.\n\n426\n00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:32,809\nMetering is what we've measured to charge\nrental fees for PCs, and then performance\n\n427\n00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:37,429\nmonitoring, just so we can check and\nmake sure there's no bottlenecks, or\n\n428\n00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:42,122\nif we have a particular machine that goes\ndown, if we have like a host go down or\n\n429\n00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:45,550\nsomething without any kind\nof clustering or fail over.\n\n430\n00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:51,342\nIf the host machine goes down,\nwhat happens to all the over VMs as well?\n\n431\n00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:54,872\nThey go down, as well.\n\n432\n00:23:54,872 --> 00:24:00,830\nSo even some of our virtual stuff,\nit all comes down to the host machine.\n\n433\n00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,270\nA virtual hard drive can't really fail.\n\n434\n00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,750\nWell the physical disk that's hosting\nthat virtual disk, that can fail.\n\n435\n00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,660\nAnd so monitoring this kind of stuff,\nnot only for\n\n436\n00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,590\nthose virtual machines\nif we have metering.\n\n437\n00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,860\nBut we also need to monitor that host VM,\nor host OS as well.\n\n438\n00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,630\nBecause if that physical hardware fails,\nand it can and\n\n439\n00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,870\nit will at one point or another.\n\n440\n00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,560\nThen all those virtuals that\nit hosts go down as well.\n\n441\n00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,560\n>> Yeah, so that's a good way for\nus to actually also remember,\n\n442\n00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,140\nthat even though we're really taking\na look at the way that the hypervisor is\n\n443\n00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,730\nactually performing and how that things\nare running in a virtualized environment.\n\n444\n00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,990\nWe really also need to\nspend a moment here,\n\n445\n00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,000\ntalk about the idea of monitoring\nthe hardware as well, okay.\n\n446\n00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,580\nSo a lot of times when we take a look at\nthis right, in a stand alone environment,\n\n447\n00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,960\nit' s incredibly critical\nthat we take a look and\n\n448\n00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,140\nwe verify that again our\nmachines are running.\n\n449\n00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,180\nThey're doing what they need to, that\nwe're monitoring for the hard drives, CPU,\n\n450\n00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,400\nthe RAM, that everything's\nperforming The way that we want to.\n\n451\n00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,840\nWhen you're doing this inside the idea of\na production environment and data center,\n\n452\n00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,650\na lot of times when you buy these servers,\n\n453\n00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,510\nthey include in some built-in tools for\nus.\n\n454\n00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,310\nSo for example,\nyou buy Dell computers, right.\n\n455\n00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,950\nThey have some software on\nthere that's called Open Manage\n\n456\n00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,110\nthat allows you again to actually get\nthe information about the actual physical\n\n457\n00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,500\nhardware monitoring on that the particular\ndevice as well that can tell you when\n\n458\n00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,580\nthings are going wrong or when things\naren't working the way that they need to.\n\n459\n00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,760\nSo if you're actually in HP, I think\nit's HP Insight is what I saw as well,\n\n460\n00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,620\nwhere you can actually have these\ntools that are again available to you.\n\n461\n00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,040\nSo using those tools are very\ncritical whether you're in\n\n462\n00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,864\na production environment.\n\n463\n00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,680\nIf you're in a standalone environment,\nokay?\n\n464\n00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,160\nIn other words, that one machine,\nand that's your entire business.\n\n465\n00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,700\nYou've got to make sure that you're\ntaking a look at this too, okay?\n\n466\n00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,780\nSo again, plan for\nthe idea of replacing these machines.\n\n467\n00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,930\nDon't leave them running for\nlike six years at a time and\n\n468\n00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,100\ngo I think it's going\nto last one more year.\n\n469\n00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,350\nYou know plan for the idea of upgrading\nand life cycle of these things as well but\n\n470\n00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,810\nthese are key components\nin terms of monitoring\n\n471\n00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,080\nour computers that we really got\nto actually take a look at here.\n\n472\n00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,050\nSo not only the hypervisor side,\nnot only the VM's and And\n\n473\n00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,700\nthe way that the performance is going, but\nthe actual physical performance as well.\n\n474\n00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,880\nAnd making sure that we keep an eye\non that too, very important.\n\n475\n00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,550\n>> Now as far as monitoring\nour host machine,\n\n476\n00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:31,320\nkeeping the performance and\neverything in check, it also brings in too\n\n477\n00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,200\nthe idea of of updates, cuz we have\nto take care of that host machine.\n\n478\n00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,720\nNow we are coming up here on break time so\nwe're kinda switching gears at this point.\n\n479\n00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,100\nSo we can get into updates.\n\n480\n00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,421\nI think we'll go ahead and take a break\nright here, and when we come back,\n\n481\n00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:53,230\nwe'll get into updates and keeping our\nhost just our host machine up and running,\n\n482\n00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,200\nhealthy and all that good stuff.\n\n483\n00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,402\nSo that our VMs can continue to run and\n\n484\n00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:02,970\nservice our performance and\nwhatever that we need.\n\n485\n00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,810\n>> Sounds great.\n\n486\n00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:04,772\n>> All right,\nwe'll get to that stuff after the break.\n\n487\n00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:11,916\n[MUSIC]\n\n488\n00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,610\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n489\n00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,340\nAll right, so where we left off,\nwe're talking about performance and\n\n490\n00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,360\nmonitoring our host VM.\n\n491\n00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,700\nAnd not only with performance,\nwe also need to manage our updates to\n\n492\n00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,570\nthat host machine cuz\nthe health of that host.\n\n493\n00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,660\nThe host machine, all right,\nso, keeping that guy up and\n\n494\n00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:41,060\nhealthy, can effect the availability\nof our virtual machines.\n\n495\n00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,730\n>> Yeah.\n\n496\n00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,750\nSo, for us here, we wanna make sure, just\nlike any other Windows machine, right,\n\n497\n00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,770\nif we're running Windows Server\n2012 using Hyper-V We've\n\n498\n00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,370\ngot to keep that machine up to\ndate in terms of that environment.\n\n499\n00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,830\nA lot of times what ends up\nhappening is relatively simple here,\n\n500\n00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,740\nthe very fact is we'll keep these VMs up\nto date because they're actually doing\n\n501\n00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,610\nthe management of our network, and\n\n502\n00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,830\nbecause we're normally doing\nsomething like remote desktop, right?\n\n503\n00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,310\nIt is actually working, but\n\n504\n00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,460\nwe tend to forget about\nthe idea of that host machine.\n\n505\n00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,120\nSo, a lot of times even though we're\nactually keeping the other VMs up to date\n\n506\n00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,580\nit could be that on\nthe host machine itself\n\n507\n00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,440\nwe're really not actually\nkeeping that one up to date.\n\n508\n00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,730\nSo, we have to actually plan for that idea\nand make sure we keep that up to date.\n\n509\n00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:28,760\nNot only in terms of the updates here,\nokay, but making sure that for\n\n510\n00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,710\nWindows, but making sure that\nthe individual BMs are up to date.\n\n511\n00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,850\nMaking sure the host machine is up\nto date is pretty much critical.\n\n512\n00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,810\nNow when we start thinking about the idea\nof Windows updates what normally pops into\n\n513\n00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,950\nour mind is the idea of automatic\nupdates is what we actually have.\n\n514\n00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,360\nWhen we take a look at that we may not\nwant to do that and usually on the idea\n\n515\n00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,490\nthe host machine in terms of the Hyper-V\nserver you don't want to do that.\n\n516\n00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,680\nThe reason why?\n\n517\n00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,180\nRemember that If you're gonna do this\nautomatic update here at 3 AM in\n\n518\n00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,510\nthe morning, it could be that what ends\nup happening, right, is that your host\n\n519\n00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:06,400\nmachine updates automatically and\nthen if it requires a reboot, it reboots.\n\n520\n00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,020\nWell Nate, what happens when\nwe reboot the host machine and\n\n521\n00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,740\nthose VMs are still running?\n\n522\n00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,960\n>> Well they'll go down.\n\n523\n00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,370\nAnd here on out that,\nwe have the host machine.\n\n524\n00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,340\nWhatever that host machine does,\nimpacts all of our virtual machines.\n\n525\n00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:27,140\nNow it depends on how we set up our\nautomatic start and stop actions.\n\n526\n00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,960\nSo hopefully when that\nhost machine shuts down.\n\n527\n00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,740\nWe've set that action to\nsave the state of our VM's.\n\n528\n00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,340\nAnd whenever that host\nmachine starts back up,\n\n529\n00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,280\neither automatically resume the state\nof those VM's if they're powered off.\n\n530\n00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,880\nWe can leave them powered off when\nthe host machine comes back on.\n\n531\n00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,190\nBring those virtual machines back.\n\n532\n00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,390\nWhatever state they were left in,\nbring them back.\n\n533\n00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,590\nThose automatic updates, they yeah\nsome them do require those reboots.\n\n534\n00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,340\nAnd yeah, it could power those guys down.\n\n535\n00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,170\n>> Yeah, what we don't want is\nthe idea of us having a surprise here.\n\n536\n00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,510\nSo a better way to do this of course,\nwould be to schedule them.\n\n537\n00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,530\nEither using the idea of a scheduled task,\nor if you're running a Windows server\n\n538\n00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,730\nupdate service go ahead and\nschedule a group task should do that.\n\n539\n00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,260\nWhere you mash your schedule,\nyour host VM's,\n\n540\n00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,180\nyour host machine running\nHyper-V dash sheet\n\n541\n00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,210\nbe on different schedule than the way that\nthe VM's are also getting updated as well.\n\n542\n00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,680\nThat way that if the VM's update,\nno big deal.\n\n543\n00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,390\nIf the host machine updates,\nwe already got it scheduled.\n\n544\n00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,080\nBut we do wanna make sure that we\ngo back in and that we can manage.\n\n545\n00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,570\nSo that they're not doing\nit at the same time.\n\n546\n00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:39,930\nSo let's take a look at that briefly\nagain, and show where to turn that on.\n\n547\n00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,180\nSo on my machine here,\n\n548\n00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,090\nI've still got that Hyper-V running\non this Window's server 2012 machine.\n\n549\n00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,970\nWell, maybe.\n\n550\n00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,550\nActually that's somebody else's machine,\nokay.\n\n551\n00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,470\nOh did you have it up?\n\n552\n00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,310\n>> What?\nOh no, I was doing something else.\n\n553\n00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,680\n>> So here on my particular machine\n>> So\n\n554\n00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,580\nremember that one thing we have to do here\nis that we need to choose what happens\n\n555\n00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,920\nwhen we power down a particular machine.\n\n556\n00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,735\nSo I right click then I go\nto Settings here, right?\n\n557\n00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:13,670\nAnd it is here that we have down at the\nbottom underneath the management section.\n\n558\n00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,290\nOf our settings for our virtual machine.\n\n559\n00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,580\nNotice that I have\nthe Automatic Stop Action and\n\n560\n00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,900\nthe Automatic Start Action as well, okay?\n\n561\n00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,410\nSo here we take a look at\nthe Automatic Start Action.\n\n562\n00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:31,340\nWhat do you want this virtual machine to\ndo when the physical computer starts?\n\n563\n00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,850\nWell a lot of times you may go look,\n\n564\n00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:36,230\nif it has to restart we may\nchoose to tell it to do nothing.\n\n565\n00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,960\nIn other words if it shuts\ndown it does nothing here.\n\n566\n00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,507\nBut notice it says we can\nautomatically start if it was\n\n567\n00:31:41,507 --> 00:31:43,380\nrunning when the service was stopped.\n\n568\n00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,725\nOr we can start this virtual\nmachine automatically here, and\n\n569\n00:31:46,725 --> 00:31:49,617\neven have a delayed reaction\nof when it kind of Layer or\n\n570\n00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:53,049\ntier these things to start it\na little bit delayed here, okay?\n\n571\n00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:57,960\nSo if the VM host reboots here,\nwhat are we telling it to do right now?\n\n572\n00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,870\nIf it was started,\ngo ahead and start it back up.\n\n573\n00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:06,970\nNotice we also have the other one here,\nwhich is the idea of the stop action.\n\n574\n00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,870\nIf my particular VM host now,\nthe host machine, has now got an update.\n\n575\n00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,770\nNow it needs to restart.\n\n576\n00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,790\nNotice it actually gives me this.\n\n577\n00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:21,750\nWhat do you want this virtual machine to\ndo when the physical computer shuts down?\n\n578\n00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,750\nNow, it's not giving me the ability\nto choose anything because this\n\n579\n00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,520\nmachine is actually running right now.\n\n580\n00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,960\nBut notice I can save the virtual\nmachine state, I can turn it off when it\n\n581\n00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,300\nactually turns off, or I can shut\ndown the guest operating system here.\n\n582\n00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,100\nIf you're doing this in\na production environment,\n\n583\n00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,560\nyou're probably gonna wanna actually save\nthis virtual machine state for right now.\n\n584\n00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,090\nThat way when you do restart it,\nit actually is where it needs to be, but\n\n585\n00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,030\nyou can of course also set it\nto shut down if you want to.\n\n586\n00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,390\nAnd then tell it to turn back on\nwhen everything restarts again.\n\n587\n00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,560\nSo it just depends on your need for\nthe moment.\n\n588\n00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,930\nA lot of times, you may wanna go ahead and\njust do a graceful shutdown,\n\n589\n00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,610\nallow it to do everything that it needs\nto do and then have it turn back on,\n\n590\n00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,280\njust depending on what your need\nactually is at that moment.\n\n591\n00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,940\nSo again, different options available for\nyou, it turns out, okay?\n\n592\n00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,760\nAgain, surprises are what we don't want.\n\n593\n00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,470\nSo automatic updates on the host machine.\n\n594\n00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,360\nNormally not a great idea for us, we want\nto be able to manage them differently than\n\n595\n00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,465\nthe way we have in the VMs, right?\n\n596\n00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:18,225\n>> Yeah.\nNow,\n\n597\n00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:21,530\nas you say, in the background I\nwas firing up our domain control.\n\n598\n00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:28,590\nI didn't know if we had any, the WSUS\nfired up, installed, which we don't.\n\n599\n00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,090\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH] >> We didn't have it up there.\n\n600\n00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,640\nI was hoping that, to cook that stuff.\n\n601\n00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,900\nNow within WSUS,\nWindows Server Update Services,\n\n602\n00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,800\nwhat we can do is we can\ncreate groups in there.\n\n603\n00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,730\nSo we can set up a group for\nour Hyper-V servers.\n\n604\n00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,580\nAnd so that way those updates\nget pushed out to those, and\n\n605\n00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,450\nwe can manage those,\nwe manage the stuff on there.\n\n606\n00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,400\nSo, what Ronnie said.\n\n607\n00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,805\nAnd now, one thing we haven't\nquite touched on this yet.\n\n608\n00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:03,420\nWe mentioned earlier about that,\na Hyper-V server,\n\n609\n00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,060\nwhere it's just a very stripped down.\n\n610\n00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,130\nWe mentioned it earlier, and\nwhile I was logged into these labs,\n\n611\n00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,560\nI thought we'd just click on over and\ntake a look at it.\n\n612\n00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,810\nI know we're talking about updates.\n\n613\n00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,490\n>> That's fine.\n\n614\n00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,935\n>> Actually kind of right in the middle.\n\n615\n00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:19,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But on this machine here,\n\n616\n00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,680\nyou can just go over here to Hyper-V01.\n\n617\n00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,790\nAnd that's it.\n\n618\n00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,100\nSo that right there is\nHyper-V server 2012 R2.\n\n619\n00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,910\nAnd it's a little tiny.\n\n620\n00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:35,510\nI can I'll bump up this font a little bit.\n\n621\n00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,050\nLet me click here, and\nthen click there, and click that.\n\n622\n00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,910\nNow this right here is called a S config.\n\n623\n00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:45,706\nIt's all command line, and well,\nS config is all command line.\n\n624\n00:34:45,706 --> 00:34:49,950\nBut Hyper-V Server 2012 R2, this is it.\n\n625\n00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,550\nThere's really no GUI, no nothing.\n\n626\n00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,440\nWe can fall down to the command line and\ndo things that way.\n\n627\n00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,650\nNow, to manage these servers,\ngenerally they would be done using\n\n628\n00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,755\na remote server administration tools,\nor the RSAT tools.\n\n629\n00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:10,110\nOr they would be managed from some\nseparate machine to do these guys.\n\n630\n00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,710\nBut yeah, anyhow.\n\n631\n00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,370\nSo I just wanted to show\nit while we were logged in.\n\n632\n00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,352\nThat's all it is.\n\n633\n00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,217\n>> Yeah.\n\n634\n00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:19,630\nNow, you take a look at this and\nit's stripped down, and\n\n635\n00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,190\nit really is actually designed to be\nmanaged from the command prompt here.\n\n636\n00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,340\nNotice that on number five,\nit has the Windows Update settings, right?\n\n637\n00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,490\nAnd these are set to manual for us.\n\n638\n00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,880\nAnd you may say well if I can actually\njust install Windows Server 2012,\n\n639\n00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,070\ninstall the Hyper-V roll, why not do that?\n\n640\n00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,030\nWell again that's a good question here.\n\n641\n00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,780\nBut at the same time, because we're\nrunning this inside of the non-GUI\n\n642\n00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:48,510\ninterface, it really does limit us\nto the updates that we really need.\n\n643\n00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,220\nA lot of times those other updates are\nreally designed just for Windows Server\n\n644\n00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,950\nand some of the other kinda GUI stuff that\nwe actually have to worry about here.\n\n645\n00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:01,000\nBut by restricting this and actually only\ndownloading the updates for the Hyper-V,\n\n646\n00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,410\nthis may help us to eliminate\na lot of the other issues as well.\n\n647\n00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,800\nSo, it's a good alternative.\n\n648\n00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,215\nRemember that this alternative\nhere is free for us.\n\n649\n00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:09,150\nIt's what we have.\n\n650\n00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,240\nAnd the only thing you have to worry\nabout, of course, is the licensing for\n\n651\n00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,700\nthe VMs that you're running inside\nof just the Microsoft Hyper-V.\n\n652\n00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,680\nSo now, I didn't mention this because\nwe didn't really talk about the idea,\n\n653\n00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,870\nthe installing of Windows Server itself,\nbut\n\n654\n00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,150\nwhen you install\nWindows Server 2012 itself.\n\n655\n00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,480\nDon't forget, you also have that\nserver core edition that you can run,\n\n656\n00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,500\nwhich is not exactly the same as this,\nbut it is closer, okay?\n\n657\n00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,212\nOnce again, running that server core\nedition eliminates a lot of the other\n\n658\n00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:39,690\ngraphical stuff.\n\n659\n00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,860\nAnd again better performance for\nus by stripping it down, but\n\n660\n00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,980\nonly really running that idea of\nthe server core all command prompt.\n\n661\n00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,760\nAgain, eliminating a lot of\nthe updates that we may need for\n\n662\n00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,380\nthe rest of Windows Server.\n\n663\n00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,340\nSo making sure that\nthese machine updates or\n\n664\n00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,050\nthe Windows Operating system\nupdates are pushed out.\n\n665\n00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:03,320\nGetting them and keeping them up to date,\nan essential part of making sure that our\n\n666\n00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,705\nvirtualization infrastructure\nis gonna be solid.\n\n667\n00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:11,000\n>> Yeah,\nwith core installs without that GUI,\n\n668\n00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,980\nwithout Internet Explorer, which takes\nthe majority of the security updates,\n\n669\n00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,890\nnot only does it limit the amount\nof updates we have to push\n\n670\n00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:24,260\nout to our servers, but\nalso lowers that attack surface.\n\n671\n00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:30,630\nAnd so, smaller footprint, smaller things,\nand allow the bad guys in to our systems.\n\n672\n00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,160\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n673\n00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,520\nNow, even though we've talked about the\nwindows updates, once again the thing we\n\n674\n00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,520\ntend to leave off the majority of the time\nhere is also the idea of hardware updates.\n\n675\n00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,360\nWhat we're really mentioning here is\nthe idea of firmware updates, right Nate?\n\n676\n00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,950\n>> Yep.\n\n677\n00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:48,180\nYeah, firmware updates,\nBIOS updates, those sorts of things.\n\n678\n00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,440\nBefore the show,\nwe were talking with Don Pezet and\n\n679\n00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,690\nhe was sharing with us a little story\nthat there was a firmware update for\n\n680\n00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,180\na particular, was it a card, a controller\ncard or something of that sort?\n\n681\n00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,172\nAnd it was causing a freezing,\nfreezing of something.\n\n682\n00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:05,765\nI think I was doing\nsomething else at the time.\n\n683\n00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:08,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Zoning off as I normally do whenever he\n\n684\n00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,830\nstarts talking.\n\n685\n00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,598\n>> Yeah.\n>> But but\n\n686\n00:38:09,598 --> 00:38:12,284\nit ended up being a firmware update.\n\n687\n00:38:12,284 --> 00:38:16,910\nAnd updating that he said his\nfreezing issues had gone away.\n\n688\n00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,780\nSo, hardware stuff also\nrequires a bit of updates.\n\n689\n00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,569\nI mean, with updates it comes\nwith that like, compatibility and\n\n690\n00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:31,440\nthose sorts of things as new stuff is\nreleased, it'll help keep things current.\n\n691\n00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,780\n>> Yeah, if you kind of think about it,\nit makes sense right?\n\n692\n00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,540\nIf I buy a brand new storage area\nnetwork appliance of some sort, right?\n\n693\n00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,350\nIt may now be a couple of\nyears newer than my server.\n\n694\n00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,620\nAnd that means that maybe that that\nserver wasn't really designed,\n\n695\n00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,440\nin terms of the hardware, to be able to\nactually work with that server very well.\n\n696\n00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,450\nSo by providing the latest firmware and\nBIOS updates that we can,\n\n697\n00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:58,590\nwe may see that the manufacturer\nhas again now put in those\n\n698\n00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:02,790\nextensions that really do need us, need\nto be able to connect to those things.\n\n699\n00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,360\nSo a lot of the time when\nwe're dealing with this,\n\n700\n00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,140\nit's really that high end specialized\nhardware like the idea of\n\n701\n00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,670\nfiber channel and stuff like that\nwhere it may be all good, it may not.\n\n702\n00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,920\nKeeping these things up to date is really\nan important thing in terms of that\n\n703\n00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,170\nfirmware and the BIOS updates that we\nreally do need, allowing us to do that.\n\n704\n00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,450\nThe freezing that Nate was talking about,\nsometimes what we may actually have to do,\n\n705\n00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,840\nright, if we see virtual machines freezing\n\n706\n00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,150\nis that may be related to\nthe idea of this firmware update.\n\n707\n00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,820\nWhere again,\n\n708\n00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,950\nthat communication is not occurring\nbetween those devices that need to.\n\n709\n00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,080\nSo a lot of times the fix it is just to\nmake sure you go back in, not only run\n\n710\n00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,700\nyour Windows updates that you need to,\nor your Microsoft Hyper-V updates.\n\n711\n00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,795\nBut also go back in and verify that all\nyour hardware BIOS, firmware updates,\n\n712\n00:39:45,795 --> 00:39:49,220\neverything that you have on that\nmachine is what needs to be done.\n\n713\n00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,436\nSo, keeping that is really an important\npart of making sure that your\n\n714\n00:39:53,436 --> 00:39:58,390\nvirtualization network Is actually gonna\nrun the way that you need it to as well.\n\n715\n00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:04,217\nAlso remember that in Hyper-V, for us,\nhaving those virtual machine integration\n\n716\n00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:09,480\nservices installed on those operating\nsystems that we're running is key.\n\n717\n00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,994\nThe good thing is with Windows Server\n2012 and Windows 8 and 8.1,\n\n718\n00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,621\nthey're already kind of baked in or\nintegrated into the operating system,\n\n719\n00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:18,220\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n720\n00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,137\nBut anything else that we're gonna be\nrunning on Hyper-V, to support it,\n\n721\n00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:23,689\nto make sure it can take advantage\nof all the hardware that we have,\n\n722\n00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:26,415\nwanna make sure that those things\nare also installed on there too.\n\n723\n00:40:26,415 --> 00:40:27,750\nMm-hm.\n\n724\n00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,090\n>> Yeah, you know, integration services.\n\n725\n00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,440\nYeah, with Windows XP, Windows 7.\n\n726\n00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,650\nThose guys will require\nthose integration services.\n\n727\n00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,820\nYou know, Hyper-V.\n\n728\n00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,980\nYou can also load up some Linux\nmachines on there as well, like CentOS.\n\n729\n00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,990\nWe have a CentOS virtual machine,\ncourse it's not called CentOS.\n\n730\n00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:49,650\nI think we named it something kind of\nobscure, so it's hard to find, but yeah,\n\n731\n00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:56,170\nthere are specific integration\nservices for that release of CentOS,\n\n732\n00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,210\nso that you can manage and\nmonitor those pieces of that machine.\n\n733\n00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,630\n>> So, updates are as important, if not\nmore important on that host machine.\n\n734\n00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,540\nForgetting it okay,\ncan again really cause some issues.\n\n735\n00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,210\nSo make sure you keep the host machine\nas well as the VM's that are running\n\n736\n00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,360\nup to date.\n\n737\n00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,210\nMake sure that you actually pay attention\nto the performance that we've been\n\n738\n00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,570\ntalking about here.\n\n739\n00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,670\nReally important if we want\nto keep everything up and\n\n740\n00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,920\nrunning and the way that we want to.\n\n741\n00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,390\nPart of the idea of doing\nthis again is what,\n\n742\n00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,220\nis the idea of hardware optimization.\n\n743\n00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,750\nUsing the hardware as\nmuch of it as we can.\n\n744\n00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,540\nSaving the idea of money is\na big part of what we have here.\n\n745\n00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,180\nSo all these technologies combine together\nmonitoring, making sure that everything's\n\n746\n00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,260\nup to date, is a key to making\nsure that all this works.\n\n747\n00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,940\nIf you have a kind of a bad experience,\n\n748\n00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,840\nright, you may not actually be\ndoing everything that you need to.\n\n749\n00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,700\nSo monitoring and updating, important\nparts of using virtualization technology.\n\n750\n00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:01,550\n>> Yep now Ronnie would you say that\nif you have a cluster setup and\n\n751\n00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:05,450\nsome fail over would you say it's less\nimportant because if the thing fails it\n\n752\n00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,580\nwill all just transfer over\nto the working machine.\n\n753\n00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,180\n>> Well to a point, I don't wanna\nsay it's less important right?\n\n754\n00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,050\nBut it allows you to have\na little bit more leeway okay?\n\n755\n00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,450\nBecause we can set up the idea of high\navailability or clustering here okay?\n\n756\n00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,020\nIt gives us the ability to essentially\ngo look, if that one machine fails,\n\n757\n00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,960\neverything will get transferred over to\nthe machine that's actually still working,\n\n758\n00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,140\nbut it doesn't really prevent these\nother things that we may have.\n\n759\n00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,820\nSo we may still be dealing with\nthose issues, but we go with them\n\n760\n00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,360\na little bit easier and not have to worry\nabout the idea of those machines too much.\n\n761\n00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,390\n>> All right Ronnie,\n\n762\n00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:44,400\nwell that, yeah, that about tapped out for\nupdates and monitoring.\n\n763\n00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,100\nAny last little bit to toss in there?\n\n764\n00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,390\nAnything else on your little\nnote sheet that we glanced over?\n\n765\n00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,300\n>> Well, just remember that\nvirtualization technology,\n\n766\n00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,390\nif you're new to the field of IT, you're\ngonna get submerged into it, because this\n\n767\n00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:01,270\nis pretty much the environment that you're\nseeing And it's not gonna go away, okay?\n\n768\n00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,885\nSo you've gotta get used to it.\n\n769\n00:43:02,885 --> 00:43:07,330\nHyper-V is a great way for you to go\nout and be able to test this stuff.\n\n770\n00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,910\nBe able to work with it a little bit more,\nand work with these tools.\n\n771\n00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,790\nDon't think that, hey,\nI'll never see that,\n\n772\n00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,900\nthat I'm gonna have to worry about it.\n\n773\n00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,330\nWhether you're a desktop support level\ntechnician or system administration,\n\n774\n00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,660\nyou're gonna end up seeing this technology\nso you might as well be familiar with it.\n\n775\n00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,790\nThere's a lot of free\nmaterial out there for\n\n776\n00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,268\nyou to be able to do this so\ndon't hesitate.\n\n777\n00:43:27,268 --> 00:43:28,453\n>> Sweet.\n\n778\n00:43:28,453 --> 00:43:33,280\nAll right, well, if you ever have\nany questions during the show,\n\n779\n00:43:33,280 -->
