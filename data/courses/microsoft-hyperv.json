ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,080\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,030\nHows it going Nathan?\n\n6\n00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,114\nPretty good Ronnie how are you today?\n\n7\n00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:46,360\nAll right ready for\nanother exciting episode into the world of\n\n8\n00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,095\nvirtualization today is\nwhere we're heading.\n\n9\n00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:48,940\nMm-hm.\n\n10\n00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,759\nYeah.\nYeah virtualization.\n\n11\n00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,660\nVirtualization stuff today.\n\n12\n00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,615\nWe will be focusing on Hyper-V.\n\n13\n00:00:55,615 --> 00:01:00,640\nHyper-V is what we'll be using to\nbuild our virtual machines and\n\n14\n00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,030\nall that stuff off of.\n\n15\n00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,250\nBut before we get into that let's talk\na bit about virtualization and just\n\n16\n00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,630\nkind of what it is and why we would want\nto virtualize some of our workstations.\n\n17\n00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,330\nYeah, now a lot of times when we start\ntalking about the idea of virtualization,\n\n18\n00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,760\nif you haven't heard about this term,\n\n19\n00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,970\nagain, this is where we can actually fully\nuse the hardware of the computer, right.\n\n20\n00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,260\nThe majority of the time when\nwe're actually using computer,\n\n21\n00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,150\nwe're running an operating system and\nsome applications, and\n\n22\n00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,780\ndoing a few functions, but we're really\nnot taking advantage of the high powered\n\n23\n00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,110\nperformance parts that we do have\ninside of our particular machines here.\n\n24\n00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,990\nVirtualization gives us\nthe benefit to be able to do that.\n\n25\n00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,740\nAnd the exciting benefit of doing this\nof course is actually being able to run\n\n26\n00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,080\nmultiple operating systems\nsimultaneously as what we have okay.\n\n27\n00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,910\nYep, so Ronnie so I've got a got\na statistic that I got from Don Pezet\n\n28\n00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,190\na while ago and\nI don't know what his reference is,\n\n29\n00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:03,280\nso once he said that 80% of the people\nus just 20% of their computer resources.\n\n30\n00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,250\nSo while we've got some of these high\npower work stations with a ton of\n\n31\n00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,100\nRAM you know we've got all this hard\ndrive space crammed in there and\n\n32\n00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,690\nwe use it for\nlooking- Browsing the internet.\n\n33\n00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,680\nYeah, looking at funny cat pictures and\nwriting email.\n\n34\n00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,210\nThat's right.\n\n35\n00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,760\nRight, so\nthere is a lot of system performance,\n\n36\n00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,590\nsome of our utilization\nthat just goes unused.\n\n37\n00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,250\nAnd so leveraging virtualization,\nwe can run multiple\n\n38\n00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,720\ninstances of a PC on top of our hardware\nand really get the most out of it.\n\n39\n00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,600\nNow, we've been able to do this but\nonly one operating system at a time.\n\n40\n00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,020\nFor example you've heard about the idea\nof dual-booting a computer, right?\n\n41\n00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,520\nThis is where you actually\nrun two operating systems.\n\n42\n00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,540\nBut you boot into one, you use that, and\n\n43\n00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,470\ndo everything that you need to with that\nand the application that you need, and\n\n44\n00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,770\nthen you can shut that machine down,\nreboot into the other operating system.\n\n45\n00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,180\nIn terms of virtualization, we're talking\nabout running two separate operating\n\n46\n00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,330\nsystems at least simultaneously\non the same set of hardware.\n\n47\n00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,220\nSo that actually is kind\nof a neat technique for us,\n\n48\n00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,580\nto be able to take advantage of all of the\nactual performance improvements that we've\n\n49\n00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,044\ngotten from hardware over the years.\n\n50\n00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:11,700\nSo Ronnie,\n\n51\n00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,732\nlet me, as far as virtualization, let me\nalso toss this one out at you, all right.\n\n52\n00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:20,790\nSo let's think about, in a,\nwe've got a server closet.\n\n53\n00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,660\nAnd inside our server closet,\nwe've got a bunch of servers in there.\n\n54\n00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,091\nAnd these servers,\nthey do just one task, right?\n\n55\n00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,881\nSo we've got an email server,\nwe gotta file server,\n\n56\n00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:32,360\nwe've got our domain controller, right?\n\n57\n00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,070\nIt's our own little, little server.\n\n58\n00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,990\nSo let's say that you are a sys\nadmin at some place, and so\n\n59\n00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:45,240\nyour manager comes to you and says hey,\nwe need to bring up an Asterisk server.\n\n60\n00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,990\nLet's say we're gonna roll out\na Voice over IP or something.\n\n61\n00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,600\nSo we need to bring up an Asterisk server.\n\n62\n00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,290\nSo now you've got to go and\nspec out what hardware you need.\n\n63\n00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,660\nYou have to get your server ordered,\nit has to be built and shipped out.\n\n64\n00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,660\nOf course, intercepted and\nthen stuff loaded onto it.\n\n65\n00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,635\nThen it will be repackaged [LAUGH] And\nthen.\n\n66\n00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:04,229\nShipped out to you.\n\n67\n00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:06,310\nYes.\nAnd then shipped out to you from there.\n\n68\n00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,940\nAnd then you have to get the server,\nyou have to put it in your server rack,\n\n69\n00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,120\nyou have to make sure you have UPS- Power.\n\n70\n00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120\nPower for it.\n\n71\n00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,120\nAnd load up all your software,\nthen configure it and this takes a while.\n\n72\n00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,900\nIt does.\nSo maybe,\n\n73\n00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,100\nI don't know, at least a few weeks.\n\n74\n00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,860\nCould take a few days to a few\nweeks to get everything done,\n\n75\n00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860\nin terms of the ordering and\neverything else.\n\n76\n00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,340\nYou are correct.\n\n77\n00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,069\nNow if we contrast that to let's say\nwe're now running on virtualization.\n\n78\n00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,170\nSo then your manager comes to you and\nsays, hey,\n\n79\n00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,696\nwe need an Asterisk server brought up,\nso what can you do?\n\n80\n00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:45,469\nWell, you can go and slice off a piece of\nyour system hardware, spin up a virtual\n\n81\n00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:50,172\nmachine, you can start configuring it\nbefore you go to lunch and get it brought\n\n82\n00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:55,330\nup within that day or within a couple\nof days after configuring everything.\n\n83\n00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,680\nSo virtualizing our stuff I made it,\nI mean, fantastic.\n\n84\n00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,250\nRight.\n\n85\n00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,130\nThe main benefit again is taking advantage\nof the hardware that we already have in\n\n86\n00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,810\nexistence here, so not maybe even\nagain like what Nate mentioned,\n\n87\n00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,900\nwe might not have to\nactually buy new hardware.\n\n88\n00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,720\nWhat we can actually do is utilize the\nhardware that we have a little bit better,\n\n89\n00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,140\nthe term is what we call optimization,\nright?\n\n90\n00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,560\nOptimizing the use of\nthe hardware before us.\n\n91\n00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,330\nSo when we start talking about\nthat idea of virtualization here,\n\n92\n00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,340\nwhat are we really actually\ndoing with the actual\n\n93\n00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,930\nhardware is what we're really\ntalking about here, okay.\n\n94\n00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,140\nSo normally for what we set, right.\n\n95\n00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,140\nWe load on an operating system,\nwe load on applications.\n\n96\n00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,740\nAnd that takes advantage of all\nthe hardware in front of it.\n\n97\n00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,330\nBut there are times, though, that we need\nis actually to be able to run, up front,\n\n98\n00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,760\nseveral operating systems exactly at\nthe same time on that same hardware.\n\n99\n00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,240\nVirtualization is what helps us do that.\n\n100\n00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,535\nAnd there's actually a couple of\ndifferent ways that we can do that.\n\n101\n00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:47,990\nMm-hm.\n\n102\n00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,340\nYep.\nYep, couple of different ways.\n\n103\n00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,360\nWhat do mean?\n\n104\n00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,440\nWhat ways?\n\n105\n00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,250\nYeah, well, for us here, when we talk\nabout the idea of virtualization if kind\n\n106\n00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,515\nof falls down into two bigger categories\nof what we can actually do, right?\n\n107\n00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:02,201\nThe idea of what we call type-1 and\n\n108\n00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:05,105\ntype-2 hypervisors is what\nwe're talking about, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:09,855\nNow the idea of the hypervisor for\nus is a virtual machine manager, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:13,250\nWhat it does is monitor, or\nwhatever you want to call it here.\n\n111\n00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,020\nIt again, allows us to be able to\nemulate the hardware basically and\n\n112\n00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,330\nthen lie to the operating systems that\nwant to give if a software environment\n\n113\n00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,920\nthat actually emulates the hardware is\nwhat we're really taking a look at here.\n\n114\n00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,995\nYeah, so the type-1 and the type-2.\n\n115\n00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:33,290\nDo we want to get into slight specific\nones and how they differ from each other?\n\n116\n00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,352\nWell, let's try and\ngive them a little bit of a visual here.\n\n117\n00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:40,500\nSo over on my picker machine\nas we take a look here.\n\n118\n00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,010\nYou'll see I made a little diagram for\nus and hopefully\n\n119\n00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,110\neverything will actually work exactly\nthe way I planned it to work out here.\n\n120\n00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,888\nSo the way I was describing\na traditional PC,\n\n121\n00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:55,471\nin terms of what we call\na non-virtualized environment,\n\n122\n00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:59,508\nhere is the hardware that we would have,\nso whatever it might be.\n\n123\n00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:02,542\nAgain, our CPU, our RAM, our hard drive,\n\n124\n00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:05,911\nmotherboard exactly what we have here,\nright?\n\n125\n00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:08,682\nWe then go out, and\nwe purchase an operating system, and\n\n126\n00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:12,050\nwe install that on to the hardware\nat this point, makes it bootable.\n\n127\n00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,780\nAllow us to go to work with\nthat hardware as well.\n\n128\n00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,630\nAnd then we start purchasing\nindividual applications.\n\n129\n00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,670\nSo there is Nate's Steam client,\nwhatever he wants here.\n\n130\n00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,190\nAnd then maybe he actually has an email\nprogram, whatever else he does here,\n\n131\n00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,370\nand of course maybe\neven some other things.\n\n132\n00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,650\nSo I just labeled these\njust generically for\n\n133\n00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,130\nfour different applications\nthat we would run, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,730\nSo at this point, as we're running these,\n\n135\n00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,140\nit is taking advantage of\nthe hardware that we have, but\n\n136\n00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,890\nit could be that we're really not taking\nthe full advantage of the hardware.\n\n137\n00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,990\nSo we're using maybe 20% of everything\nthat we actually have installed on here\n\n138\n00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,130\nin terms of hardware, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,710\nAnd most of us have been doing that.\n\n140\n00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,450\nAnd that's pretty much what we have.\n\n141\n00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,764\nBut if you're working in an environment\nin which you actually need to take\n\n142\n00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:56,321\nadvantage of this hardware more.\n\n143\n00:07:56,321 --> 00:08:00,532\nBecause bringing up new computers can\nbe expensive and everything else here,\n\n144\n00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:03,273\nwe may want to look at this\nidea of virtualization,\n\n145\n00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:05,017\nis what we want to take a look at.\n\n146\n00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:09,705\nAnd so for us here, there's many products\nout there And the main one that we can\n\n147\n00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:14,606\nactually start out with, which is a little\nbit strange here, but it's the idea of\n\n148\n00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:19,320\nactually doing what we call a choosing,\nwhat's called a Type II Hypervisor.\n\n149\n00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,610\nNow, this actually does\nrun fairly similar to\n\n150\n00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,720\nthe way that the non-virtualized\nenvironment does.\n\n151\n00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,985\nAnd let me show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n152\n00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:32,420\nAt the base of it,\nis essentially the same concept.\n\n153\n00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,550\nSo you'll notice it's pretty much the same\nas the non-virtualized idea here.\n\n154\n00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,670\nYou're running your basic hardware.\n\n155\n00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,790\nYou're running your operating system and\neven a few applications on it.\n\n156\n00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,250\nBut then, you can go out and actually\ndownload, well some of these is what we\n\n157\n00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,470\ncall the idea of a virtual PC client,\nor a management system.\n\n158\n00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,290\nIf you've heard of things like,\nOracle Virtual Box or\n\n159\n00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,170\nMicrosoft Virtual PC, these are things\nthat we can actually put on in\n\n160\n00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,220\naddition to the current\noperating system that's running.\n\n161\n00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,430\nAnd that allows us now, to have this\nunit here, which is that hypervisor.\n\n162\n00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,420\nThis takes the hardware and essentially\ntranslates it into software giving\n\n163\n00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,010\nus essentially a fake environment or\na virtualized environment is what it does.\n\n164\n00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,770\nAnd now, when I run that I can\nspec out an actual machine.\n\n165\n00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,690\nI can tell it how big I want\nthe hard drive to be, how,\n\n166\n00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,920\nRAM I was trying to think of the word, how\nmuch RAM I want to give to it, as well.\n\n167\n00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,210\nAnd then, I can install an operating\nsystem in that environment, and\n\n168\n00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,440\ninside that operating system,\n\n169\n00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,910\nI can also run, well, another\nmachine directly on top of it here.\n\n170\n00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,620\nOkay?\n\n171\n00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,990\nNow we do actually have to make room\nbecause we're still running a regular PC\n\n172\n00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,910\nhere with the actual operating system and\nall the applications, as well as, running\n\n173\n00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,360\nthis hypervisor so they have to share\nthe common resources between them, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,800\nSo that's usually the first level\nthat most people end up trying here\n\n175\n00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,710\nwhen we start taking that\nidea of virtualization.\n\n176\n00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,420\nAs you can go out and\n\n177\n00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,200\nfind these products anywhere if you\njust do a regular Google search.\n\n178\n00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,110\nYou can find them,\ninstall them right on and\n\n179\n00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,220\nit works just like another application.\n\n180\n00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,490\nWhen you do that, you can be\nrunning your base operating system,\n\n181\n00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,880\nrunning this particular virtual\nmachine manager for us.\n\n182\n00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,400\nAnd then actually running\nan operating system inside a window,\n\n183\n00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,890\nif you're running Windows.\n\n184\n00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,470\nSo you're running simultaneous\noperating systems is what you're doing.\n\n185\n00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,710\nYeah, and\nwith the ype II hypervisor there it's\n\n186\n00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,620\nyou can think of it as\nkind of like an emulator.\n\n187\n00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:40,780\nSo, if you ever fired up any SENS ROMs or\nany Genesis roms, they run as an emulator.\n\n188\n00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,920\nAnd so basically, yeah a type two.\n\n189\n00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,060\nThat's kind of what it is.\n\n190\n00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,920\nIt emulates hardware, the OS and\n\n191\n00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,230\nthen uses,and so the operating system\nthat it sits on top of the hardware.\n\n192\n00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,080\nSo now for the guest OS.\n\n193\n00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,430\nSo the VMs that are running.\n\n194\n00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,120\nWhen those VMs need to access memory or\nhard disk or something of that sort,\n\n195\n00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,474\nthen it contacts the hypervisor and\ngets it's virtual hardware,\n\n196\n00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:12,980\nthen the hypervisor then talks to the OS.\n\n197\n00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,100\nHey, I need to access the hard drive for\nsomething.\n\n198\n00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,750\nAnd then the OS then lets it get down\nto the hardware and make that call.\n\n199\n00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,690\nSo, the OS, it sits in the middle, so\nit's kind of the gatekeeper between\n\n200\n00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,060\nthe virtual hardware that\nsits in the hypervisor, and\n\n201\n00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,309\nthen the real hardware,\nthat is the bare metal.\n\n202\n00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,370\nNow the other type of hypervisor that\nwe have is the type I hypervisor.\n\n203\n00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,050\nNow this one runs a bit different.\n\n204\n00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,170\nNow the hypervisor it sits\ndirectly on top of the hardware,\n\n205\n00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,810\nso it sits underneath\nthe operating system.\n\n206\n00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,830\nAnd what this does is it generally\njust exposes the hardware directly\n\n207\n00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,850\nto those guests OS's right,\nor those virtual machines.\n\n208\n00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:04,390\nAnd so performance, performance it's\nnear identical to a bare metal install.\n\n209\n00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,460\nNow I mean there's, some things can be a\ncontention and other things of that sort.\n\n210\n00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,020\nAnd kind of get in the way and\nslow it down a little bit.\n\n211\n00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,730\nBut this is gonna be what\nwe'll use in a production or\n\n212\n00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,230\njust to get the most speed and\npower out of our virtual machines.\n\n213\n00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,770\nAnd a lot of times it's not\na production environment,\n\n214\n00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,240\nsuch as a business environment.\n\n215\n00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,670\nThis is the type of\nhypervisor that you'll see\n\n216\n00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,190\nused more often as this\ntype one hypervisor.\n\n217\n00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,750\nIn which we just buy our\nparticular servers that we need.\n\n218\n00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,200\nWe install the actual\nbare metal hypervisor or\n\n219\n00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,810\nthe virtual machine manager that we want.\n\n220\n00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,660\nWe're gonna be focusing in on Hyper V for\nus, is what we're gonna do.\n\n221\n00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,980\nAnd then from that point, we can go\nahead and allow that hypervisor, again,\n\n222\n00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,260\nto now be able to create multiple\nvirtual machines on top of it.\n\n223\n00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,410\nAnd with the server hardware,\nwe can actually create well, a lot times,\n\n224\n00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,320\ndepending as much hardware as you actually\nhave in terms of RAM and hard drive space,\n\n225\n00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,360\nyou can create just about as many you want\njust about here, is what we want here.\n\n226\n00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,080\nSo usually inside of an environment, these\nare kind of the options that we have.\n\n227\n00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,770\nEither a Type I or a Type II hypervisor.\n\n228\n00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,700\nSo, for us, in terms of virtualization\nthose are pretty much the two different\n\n229\n00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,270\nbasic types that we have.\n\n230\n00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:25,810\nSo with the type one the hypervisor,\nit acts as the traffic cop more or less.\n\n231\n00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,510\nYou know making the calls back and\nforth as opposed to the OS.\n\n232\n00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,080\nGood way to go.\n\n233\n00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,470\nNow with type ones we have things like\nVMware., Citrix makes them, Hyper-V which\n\n234\n00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,830\nis what we will be focusing on today,\nare examples of type one hypervisors.\n\n235\n00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,590\nWe just want to make sure we clarify\nwhat the different types were and so\n\n236\n00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,340\nthat's where we're at.\n\n237\n00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,260\nSo you're going to be taking a look at\nessentially right there when we do so.\n\n238\n00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:56,710\nSo when we take a look at this\nidea of the virtualization, right.\n\n239\n00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,270\nFor us here, this is actually going to\nbe where you're going to see more often\n\n240\n00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,210\nin the business environment today.\n\n241\n00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,290\nSo no longer are the days where we just\ninstall a single operating system and\n\n242\n00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,660\nsay hey, we're just going\nto turn on just a server or\n\n243\n00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,810\njust a file server a lot of times.\n\n244\n00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,710\nIt may be we're actually running multiple\nserver roles on that one machine, but\n\n245\n00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,660\nif you actually needed to you can actually\nuse this hypervisor to separate that out\n\n246\n00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,300\nand actually have them act as their\nindependent machines directly on this same\n\n247\n00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,530\nhardware optimizing the usage again,\nis what we have.\n\n248\n00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:35,810\nSo let's take a, so now we've got\nan idea of what it is and some examples\n\n249\n00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,760\non why we would want to use it, and how\nwe can get the most out of our hardware.\n\n250\n00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,530\nNow let's talk about the hardware that\nwe need to leverage this kind of stuff.\n\n251\n00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,230\nSome of our requirements.\n\n252\n00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,550\nWhen it comes down to it,\nremember just like anything else right.\n\n253\n00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,180\nWe're gonna need some basic, minimum\nhardware requirements that we have.\n\n254\n00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,800\nSo depending on what system you use,\n\n255\n00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,260\nyou again want to take\na look at those as well.\n\n256\n00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,800\nSince we're really focusing\nin on the idea of Hyper-V, or\n\n257\n00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,440\nMicrosoft Hyper-V, or\nWindows Server Hyper-V here,\n\n258\n00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,180\nwe really wanna take a look at those\nparticular minimum system requirements.\n\n259\n00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,210\nNow the nice thing about the idea of\nrunning Windows Server, the Hyper-V\n\n260\n00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:22,080\n2012 R2 edition, is that it really doesn't\nrequire a lot more than the minimum that\n\n261\n00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,350\nit requires to install on just a regular\nWindows Server Edition, is what we have.\n\n262\n00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,902\nSo when it comes down to it on\nthe basic hardware here for us.\n\n263\n00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:35,115\nLet me see if I can actually bring\nup a notepad file for us here.\n\n264\n00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:37,710\nOops, we got another show note.\n\n265\n00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,000\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,543\nSo, for us here, on the minimum,\n\n267\n00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:51,922\nif I can spell minimum,\n[LAUGH] hardware requirements.\n\n268\n00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:57,097\nThat's pretty much the same\n\n269\n00:15:57,097 --> 00:16:02,489\nas installing Windows server\n\n270\n00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:07,670\n2012 R2, we have R2.\n\n271\n00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,926\nI can't spell.\n\n272\n00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,782\nAll right, now what are those\nparticular basic requirements?\n\n273\n00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:18,071\nFor us on the CPU, the minimum here\nis not saying what you want to do but\n\n274\n00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:22,438\nyou need at least a 1.4\ngigahert processor.\n\n275\n00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:26,400\nYou're never gonna do this with just\na minimum of your actually running\n\n276\n00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,300\nthe idea of virtualization, but that's\nkind of mims if you're doing this for\n\n277\n00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,460\nhyper v is that idea.\n\n278\n00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,960\nI'm not liking the way it's looking there.\n\n279\n00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,870\nOkay?\n\n280\n00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,420\nNow in terms of hard drive space,\n\n281\n00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,480\nonce again,\nyou're not gonna actually want to do this.\n\n282\n00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,940\nIt's going to be about, I think 30 gigs,\nis what I actually had written down there.\n\n283\n00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,440\nGigabyte hard drive.\n\n284\n00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,120\nOkay?\n\n285\n00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,930\nAnd in terms of RAM again, it's not a lot.\n\n286\n00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,070\nRemember this is the minimum\nrequirement to just install it.\n\n287\n00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,430\nIt doesn't mean it's gonna run that well.\n\n288\n00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,340\nIts going to be 512 megabytes of RAM.\n\n289\n00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,140\nNow, you and I, we would never think\nabout actually running virtualization\n\n290\n00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,176\nwith these minimal requirements, right?\n\n291\n00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:11,790\nCorrect, with some of\nthese virtual machines,\n\n292\n00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:17,110\nthey're going to require their\nown bit of hardware requirements.\n\n293\n00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:22,020\nRAM, goodness sakes,\na virtual machine you're gonna say,\n\n294\n00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,300\nat least four gigabytes of RAM.\n\n295\n00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,520\nBecause that virtual machine,\nit's still gonna need it's own ram.\n\n296\n00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,050\nYeah.\n\n297\n00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,180\nIt's been up.\n\n298\n00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,750\nThis is just for installing the actual\nregular server role is what we're talking.\n\n299\n00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,920\nIf you're gonna be\nrunning virtual machines,\n\n300\n00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,570\nevery single virtual machine is gonna\nactually also need their particular set or\n\n301\n00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,460\namount of RAM and\nhard drive space as well.\n\n302\n00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,690\nSo we'd also have to account for that too.\n\n303\n00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,080\nSo mostly when we start thinking\nabout the idea of doing this\n\n304\n00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,700\nwe want to actually try to put\nas much RAM into the computer.\n\n305\n00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,440\nAnd also, the idea of hard drive space.\n\n306\n00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,150\nIt depends on how you want to do this.\n\n307\n00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,810\nYou're either going to again max out\nthe amount of harddrive space you can,\n\n308\n00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,710\nas much money as you can put into it.\n\n309\n00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,060\nOr you match even going into looking\nat the idea of connecting to\n\n310\n00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,170\nsomething like a storage area network as\nwell to give us better performance too.\n\n311\n00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,530\nSo those are kinda the basic requirements.\n\n312\n00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,282\nRemember, that every\nsystem will be different,\n\n313\n00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:18,760\nbut since we're focusing in on Hyper V,\nhere is the minimum.\n\n314\n00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,680\nAgain, the idea of\nactually having more RAM.\n\n315\n00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,520\nMore hard drive space and of course\nmultiple processors or a single processor.\n\n316\n00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,910\nYou'll usually want multiple processors.\n\n317\n00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,810\nWe're gonna be You'll be doing this,\nyou get better performance.\n\n318\n00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,555\nNow, along with hyper V, we do have\nthe server, server side, hyper V.\n\n319\n00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:37,480\nMm-hm. Right? That's going on\nour Windows server 2012 R2.\n\n320\n00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,815\nWe also have a client hyper-v.\n\n321\n00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:44,175\nThis client Hyper-v,\nruns on Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.\n\n322\n00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:49,415\nAnd this for the requirements,\na little bit different for those.\n\n323\n00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:52,990\nYou know, on my system here, on the PC.\n\n324\n00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,890\nSo it says here that you got a one\ngigahertz processor for minimum and\n\n325\n00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,980\nwe need two gigabytes of RAM for\na 64 bit hard drive space there and\n\n326\n00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,990\nscrolling on down it says additional\nrequirements to use certain features.\n\n327\n00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,560\nSo down here,\nI'll just kinda highlight where we're at.\n\n328\n00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,256\nSo, client Hyper-V requires\na 64-bit system with second\n\n329\n00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,570\nlevel address translation.\n\n330\n00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,020\nNow, Ronnie really quick what is SLAT?\n\n331\n00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,049\nHow does it help us?\n\n332\n00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,830\nThis is actually what allows us to\nreally get by some of the limitations\n\n333\n00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,470\nthat we would've had without the idea\nof second level address translation.\n\n334\n00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,320\nTo allow us to get access\nto the real hardware is\n\n335\n00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,340\nwhat really allows us to do here.\n\n336\n00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,840\nSo, instead of actually just saying\nwe're gonna emulate the software\n\n337\n00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,620\nwe're actually now allowing it to go in\nand find actual address spaces in our RAM.\n\n338\n00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,202\nOr do it.\n\n339\n00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:47,964\nMm-hm.\n\n340\n00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:53,320\nAll right so along with having\nthat slat capability there Mm-hm.\n\n341\n00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,220\nAn additional 2 gigabytes of ram.\n\n342\n00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,930\nSo, what we have to have for\n\n343\n00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:05,810\nour 64 bit RAMs so we have to have\nat least 2 gigabytes for 64 bit.\n\n344\n00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,800\nSo to use Hyper V for\na client side Hyper V,\n\n345\n00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,380\nyou have to have at least four\ngigabytes of RAM in our systems.\n\n346\n00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,740\nAnd PC's today,\nlet me scroll up a little more.\n\n347\n00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,420\nIn PC's today, generally four gigabytes\nof RAM is kind of the minimum we see,\n\n348\n00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,540\nmore or less on on towers.\n\n349\n00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,170\nIf we're having small form factor PC or\nlaptops,\n\n350\n00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,880\nperhaps you would go a little bit lower.\n\n351\n00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,520\nRemember netbooks?\n\n352\n00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,100\nI do.\nRemember those little guys?\n\n353\n00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,070\nThey didn't have much RAM at all.\n\n354\n00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,080\nYeah.\n\n355\n00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,330\nNow there was one other requirement that\nwe saw there that we may have seen it.\n\n356\n00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,270\nAlso, remember that your CPU has support\nin what we call the virtualization,\n\n357\n00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,410\nas well, right?\n\n358\n00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,190\nSo, a lot of times,\nyou actually see the IBM intel VT, for\n\n359\n00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,510\nthe virtualization technology,\nor the AMD-B.\n\n360\n00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,840\nThis means that both the AMD and\n\n361\n00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,340\nthe intel will be able to support\nthe virtualization, and you go into bios.\n\n362\n00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,740\nInto the BIOS screen there to be\nable to enable it or disable it.\n\n363\n00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,170\nA lot of times you may get a machine\nthat comes right from the factory, and\n\n364\n00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,410\nyou do have the support for it.\n\n365\n00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,560\nIt's actually disabled.\n\n366\n00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,120\nYou may need to turn it on.\n\n367\n00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,250\nSo, again, go ahead and check that as\nwell if you're going to be doing this.\n\n368\n00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,320\nThis is true whether you're actually\ndoing the Server 2012 install or\n\n369\n00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,730\nthe client side Hyper-V as well.\n\n370\n00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,310\nYeah, Ronnie on this PC\nhere do have our Skycam.\n\n371\n00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,900\nI could shut this PC down and\nwe could take a look at the BIOS.\n\n372\n00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,820\nYeah, so with our Skycam it's\nnot the clearest, right there.\n\n373\n00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,920\nBut sure enough.\n\n374\n00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,130\nSo up there at the top,\nvirtualization it is is enabled, and\n\n375\n00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,600\nthat is what we are after to enable it.\n\n376\n00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,360\nSo it could be that our systems have that\ncapability to virtualize machines but\n\n377\n00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,880\nin the bios.\n\n378\n00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,760\nIt could be disabled, not allowing that.\n\n379\n00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,720\nYeah.\n\n380\n00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,645\nNot allowing it to run.\n\n381\n00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,190\nMm-hm.\n\n382\n00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,200\nAnd so, we can check in there, and\nsure enough, you know, mine is enabled.\n\n383\n00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,510\nSo, we can bring up virtual machines,\nand we can bring up hyper V,\n\n384\n00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,100\nand things would work out well.\n\n385\n00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,520\nAll right.\nSo, now that we do have it enabled in our\n\n386\n00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,410\nbios and everything is good, So, Ronnie,\nso we've got our hardware requirements,\n\n387\n00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,620\nwe know how to turn on and\nmake sure that our PCs can run it.\n\n388\n00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,220\nWe know what it is and\nwe know what we can use it for,\n\n389\n00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,160\nwhy we could need it,\nthose sorts of things.\n\n390\n00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,280\nWhat's next.\n\n391\n00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,920\nWhere do we go from here.\n\n392\n00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,220\nYeah.\nOur next adventure here, of course,\n\n393\n00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,130\nis to get ready for the install process.\n\n394\n00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,750\nOr to turn on the actual\nrole that we need.\n\n395\n00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,560\nWe're actually doing the Windows\nserver Hyper-V here.\n\n396\n00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,320\nAnd enable it and\nthen get it ready to configure and\n\n397\n00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,106\nwe'll talk about that\nprocess as we go along.\n\n398\n00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:39,688\nYep.\n\n399\n00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:45,880\nAll right, Ronnie at this point we\nare switching gears a little bit so\n\n400\n00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,090\nwe'll now get into\ninstalling the feature or\n\n401\n00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,720\ninstalling the,\nbe able to run Hyper-V on there.\n\n402\n00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,290\nSo it's just, we do have a few minutes\nleft but because we are switching,\n\n403\n00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,115\nlet's go ahead and take a break here.\n\n404\n00:22:59,115 --> 00:23:02,690\nMm-hm.\nAnd when we get back let's get Hyper-V\n\n405\n00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,820\nup and running and we'll start looking\nat creating some virtual machines.\n\n406\n00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,510\nSounds good.\n\n407\n00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,812\nAll right,\nwe'll get into that stuff after the break.\n\n408\n00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:18,094\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back.\n\n409\n00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:19,590\nAll right, so where we left off.\n\n410\n00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,510\nWe were talking about the idea\ninstalling the rule or\n\n411\n00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,770\nthe feature, depending on whether\nwe are a server or a client, for\n\n412\n00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,760\nthe Hyper-V, and\nwe're getting started to get into.\n\n413\n00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,460\nWe'll take a look at the UI and\nbuild up some virtual machines.\n\n414\n00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,660\nBut before we actually do that,\nwith installing the rule, so, server-side.\n\n415\n00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,850\nThere are a couple of different\neditions of Windows Server 2012 R2 that\n\n416\n00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,410\ncontain Hyper-V, and\nwithin those editions there's,\n\n417\n00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:52,300\nI wouldn't really say different features,\nbut different I guess,\n\n418\n00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,900\nenvironments or different things that we\nwould choose one edition over the other.\n\n419\n00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,930\nRight, yeah, so\n\n420\n00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,840\nwe wanna make sure that we understand what\nit is that we're gonna be installing.\n\n421\n00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,874\nAnd why we would choose\nto do one over the other.\n\n422\n00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,811\nWhen it comes down to\nthe server side products here.\n\n423\n00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,978\nThere's really three different\nlevels of licensing that we have.\n\n424\n00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:11,115\nHowever you want to address it.\n\n425\n00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:16,480\nThere is actually just a regular Windows\nServer 2012 Standard Edition for us.\n\n426\n00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,420\nThere's the Windows Server 2012,\nI should say R2 with the data center.\n\n427\n00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:26,230\nAnd then there's a straight up\nMicrosoft Hyper V 2012 as well.\n\n428\n00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,760\nThat's just a bare metal hyper visor for\n\n429\n00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,250\nus, is what we actually\nhave in place here.\n\n430\n00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,360\nNow when it comes down\nto the features here.\n\n431\n00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,020\nBetween standard edition and the data\ncenter edition of the Hyper V role that\n\n432\n00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,160\nwe have, there is really no significant\ndifferences at all in terms of features\n\n433\n00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,600\nof the way that we can create virtual\nmachines and do what we need to with them.\n\n434\n00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,130\nThe major difference here for\nus is the licensing.\n\n435\n00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,680\nIn other words, the virtual machines\nthat we can actually support on\n\n436\n00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,614\nthe standard edition,\nversus the idea of the data center.\n\n437\n00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:04,725\nIf you're running a lightly\nvirtualized environment.\n\n438\n00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:08,417\nIn other words, you still have physical\nservers that you're running but\n\n439\n00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:11,987\nyou want to be able to begin the idea and\nthe process of virtualization,\n\n440\n00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:15,638\nyou are starting that process and\nyou're just starting to change over.\n\n441\n00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:17,867\nAnd you don't really need\na lot of virtual machines.\n\n442\n00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,706\nYou may choose to actually go ahead and\n\n443\n00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:22,303\ninstall Windows Server\n2012 Standard edition.\n\n444\n00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:27,960\nGo ahead and turn on the hyper-v role, or\nenable the hyper-v role, install it here.\n\n445\n00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,358\nThat will also allow you to run up to\ntwo copies of the actual Windows Server\n\n446\n00:25:33,358 --> 00:25:38,770\n2012 in virtual machines here,\nwithout any additional licensing.\n\n447\n00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,150\nNow, could you do more?\n\n448\n00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,700\nYes.\n\n449\n00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,250\nBut do you require an extra license?\n\n450\n00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,270\nYou will.\n\n451\n00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:47,694\nSo, this is actually good as long as\nyou're actually only really running two\n\n452\n00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:50,590\nseparate VMs of Windows Server 2012.\n\n453\n00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,590\nBeyond that, you'll have to\nprovide additional licensing.\n\n454\n00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:59,760\nSo the advantage of going to the Windows\nServer 2012 R2 Data Center edition, is\n\n455\n00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,100\nthat when you install that on a physical\nserver and you do the hyper-V, you can run\n\n456\n00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,800\nas many Windows Server 2012 editions as\nyou choose to in a virtual environment.\n\n457\n00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,650\nAnd they actually provide for a different\nway to manage the actual licensing but\n\n458\n00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,260\nthat is an unlimited licensing for you.\n\n459\n00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,500\nSo in that sense,\n\n460\n00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,015\nyou would choose to do that maybe\nin a real production environment,\n\n461\n00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:26,640\nin which you're virtualizing all of your\nservers and everything, versus the idea of\n\n462\n00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,140\nthat lightly virtualized environment where\nyou're actually only running maybe a few\n\n463\n00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,390\ndifferent services instead in\nthat virtual environment itself.\n\n464\n00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,170\nNow what makes that actually different for\nus is that there's another one.\n\n465\n00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,210\nSo on both the Server 2012 editions.\n\n466\n00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,320\nThese do cost money.\n\n467\n00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,350\nAnd depending on whether you're just\ngetting a retail licence versus a volume\n\n468\n00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,350\nlicense here.\n\n469\n00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,460\nIt can again cost between several hundred\ndollars to several thousand dollars\n\n470\n00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,510\nto make everything work like this.\n\n471\n00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,340\nMicrosoft does offer a free\nalternative solution for\n\n472\n00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,800\nyou which is the Microsoft\nhyper V 2012 as well.\n\n473\n00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,200\nAnd you can go to Microsoft and\ndownload that and you can run that.\n\n474\n00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,910\nNow we talk about using just\nthe Microsoft hyper v, okay,\n\n475\n00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,510\nthat has none of the features of server.\n\n476\n00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,630\nIt really is just that one particular\nrole that you're installing.\n\n477\n00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,610\nAnd it allows you to create as many\nvirtualization of many virtual machines as\n\n478\n00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,780\nyou want to, as long as you\nalready got licensing for it.\n\n479\n00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,220\nSo for you, can you go out and\ngo, oh okay,\n\n480\n00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,330\nI'm just going to buy twelve\ncopies of Windows server 2012.\n\n481\n00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,390\nYes.\n\n482\n00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,880\nBut the better idea is for\nyou to ready say hey look\n\n483\n00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,940\nwhat I'm doing is I'm going to\nmigrate over to Microsoft here.\n\n484\n00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,090\nYou may choose to do that.\n\n485\n00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,040\nBecause it's free it makes it easy whether\nyou are actually in a small environment.\n\n486\n00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,530\nOr whether you're in a large environment\nthat you want to move over to that.\n\n487\n00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:55,080\nSo, for example, if you were setting up,\nlet's say, your web server here, okay?\n\n488\n00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,480\nYou might actually say, look,\nI want to set this up, but\n\n489\n00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,385\nI want to actually make\na smaller footprint.\n\n490\n00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:01,785\nI also want to be able to virtualize that,\nbut\n\n491\n00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:05,584\nwithout having to actually purchase\nWindows Server 2012 to do so.\n\n492\n00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,879\nYou can run the Microsoft hyper-v and\n\n493\n00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:12,756\nthen run your particular own edition of\nyour operating system that you want to for\n\n494\n00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:16,500\nyour web server inside it\neven in a small environment.\n\n495\n00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,780\nAnd later on as you choose to.\n\n496\n00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,830\nYou go hey,\nwe're going to do this virtualization,\n\n497\n00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,970\nyou've already got something in place and\nit's absolutely free.\n\n498\n00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,320\nSo it allows you to be able to do that\nas a stand alone product by itself,\n\n499\n00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,530\nall for free here.\n\n500\n00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,859\nAnd all you have to do is worry about\nlicensing for your virtual machines.\n\n501\n00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:33,867\nSo there's a lot of different\nways that you can approach this,\n\n502\n00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:36,548\ndepending on your need and\nwhat you actually want to do.\n\n503\n00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,601\nNow if you're doing that, with\nthe Microsoft Hyper V, you have no other\n\n504\n00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:45,450\nfeatures, so don't count on being able\nto install other things along with it.\n\n505\n00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,840\nYou're just running that one role here and\nit's a very solid role.\n\n506\n00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,430\nIt works very well,\nvery high performance here.\n\n507\n00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,330\nSo, it's another thing\nthat you can think about.\n\n508\n00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,550\nBut the management of it is not easy.\n\n509\n00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,460\nThe majority of it is command line.\n\n510\n00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,068\nYou can use some of the other\ntools in the server manager\n\n511\n00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:01,720\nin 2012 to manage the server.\n\n512\n00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,350\nBut the installation itself,\n\n513\n00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,570\nthe basic setup all has to be done through\nthe console at the very beginning.\n\n514\n00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,460\nAnd all command line.\n\n515\n00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:16,100\nYep, now, Ronnie, so on my PC here,\nall right, I did go just jump over\n\n516\n00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,370\nto the CDW to take a look, you're talking\nabout hundreds to several thousand- Yep.\n\n517\n00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,910\nSo, here for our R2 data center, for\n\n518\n00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:29,098\na license We're looking at just\nabout six grand to purchase this.\n\n519\n00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:35,808\nAnd to compare it, just go down here and\nthen click on server standard.\n\n520\n00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,870\nAll right, 864 bucks.\n\n521\n00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,170\nYeah.\nSo\n\n522\n00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,815\nquite a jump to go from\nstandard to data center.\n\n523\n00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:42,460\nYeah.\n\n524\n00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:49,870\nNow let's say that, like me, I like to try\nthings out and kind of get your feet wet.\n\n525\n00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,030\nOver on the TechNet Evaluation Center,\n\n526\n00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:59,550\nthis is technet.microsoft.com/en-us/\nevalcenter is that address.\n\n527\n00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:04,480\nAnd over here there are,\nyou can download an evaluation copy\n\n528\n00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,540\nof Server 2012 and Windows 8.1.\n\n529\n00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:13,520\nAnd on these you get I mean its\nlike a time bomb where you get so\n\n530\n00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,040\nmany days to use it before\nit asks to validate and\n\n531\n00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:24,950\non here right so we've got 2012 R2\nwe've got 8.1 And then over under\n\n532\n00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:30,300\ntheir download side, There it is We got\nthat guy right there, Hyper-V Server 2012.\n\n533\n00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,740\nSo we got that and\n\n534\n00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,330\nyou can download it here and,\nroll it up and install on your machine.\n\n535\n00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,420\nAnd I think you can get three months\nout of it, and, at that point,\n\n536\n00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,970\nyou just tear it down, and rebuild it.\n\n537\n00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,440\nYeah use it some more and.\n\n538\n00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,890\nYeah, as long as you're doing it for\nevaluation Microsoft doesn't mind.\n\n539\n00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,300\nIf you're trying to run your business off\nof it, they might actually ask you for\n\n540\n00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,480\nsome money at that point.\n\n541\n00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,170\n[LAUGH] So they are limited in\nterms of those trial editions.\n\n542\n00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,950\nGreat way to actually get your hands\non it to again install these to see\n\n543\n00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,230\nwhat it is that you\nactually want to do here.\n\n544\n00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,960\nNow, are there some other differences\nbetween standard and data center?\n\n545\n00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,410\nIn terms of the Windows Server, yes.\n\n546\n00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,950\nYou can have access to a lot more\nhardware, but overall though for\n\n547\n00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,860\nthe Hyper-V, the functionality is\nreally not that different, okay,\n\n548\n00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,618\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n549\n00:31:17,618 --> 00:31:18,390\nMm-hm.\n\n550\n00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,750\nYep.\nAll right Ronnie,\n\n551\n00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,970\nso now that we've got this what?\n\n552\n00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:22,990\nWhat's next?\n\n553\n00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,740\nWhere do you wanna go from here?\n\n554\n00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,550\nFrom this point here, right, the idea of\njust talking about it has been enough.\n\n555\n00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,970\nYou've heard me and you've heard Nate\nkind of drone on about it enough here but\n\n556\n00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,150\nwe're still gonna be talking but we do\nwant to get into the idea of installing.\n\n557\n00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,620\nNow I did fail to mention one\naddition of Hyper-V that Nate\n\n558\n00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,980\ndid actually give us\nthe specifications for.\n\n559\n00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,860\nWhich is also the client-side Hyper-V\nthat runs inside of Windows 8 as well.\n\n560\n00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,006\nNow when we start taking a look at this.\n\n561\n00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:53,047\nNate, do you know really a lot of\ndifferences between what we have here and\n\n562\n00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:54,230\nthe server edition?\n\n563\n00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,670\nYeah, there are some.\n\n564\n00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,155\nSome of the specifics I can't think\nof off the top of my head, but\n\n565\n00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:05,407\nthe server side Hyper V is just\nthe full Monty, everything.\n\n566\n00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:11,013\nAnd client side Hyper V, there's a couple\nof features that are stripped out of it.\n\n567\n00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:15,633\nMyself off the top of my head,\nI cannot think exactly what they are, but\n\n568\n00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:20,484\nAs far as spitting up a VM and using it,\nadding in multiple hard drives, and\n\n569\n00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:23,680\nark adapters, and exporting these guys.\n\n570\n00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,690\nThat all is still there.\n\n571\n00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,309\nLike you can't do,\nin client's side Hyper-V,\n\n572\n00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:34,060\nyou can't do domain controller cloning and\nthings of that sort.\n\n573\n00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,540\nYou can in server,\n\n574\n00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,910\nbut some of those businessy stuff,\nyou won't be able to do in client view.\n\n575\n00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,570\nMost of the time when you\nare trying to do this,\n\n576\n00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,360\nlet's say with hyper v inside of\nthe side of the client's side as well,\n\n577\n00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,080\nthey recommend that if you're doing this,\nyou may do it for testing, right?\n\n578\n00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,720\nYou may build a machine, but\nyou want to run a production,\n\n579\n00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,640\nyou may go in and\nimport it into the server side.\n\n580\n00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,430\nSo a lot of the times,\nyou're building a test environment,\n\n581\n00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,800\nyou might use the idea of\nthe client side hyper v.\n\n582\n00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,788\nA full data center environment, again,\n\n583\n00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:02,190\nmay be actually the way\nthat you want to go again.\n\n584\n00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,650\nThat point you might move up to\nthe Windows 2012 Data Center Edition,\n\n585\n00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,430\nin terms of that full virtualization.\n\n586\n00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,250\nDepending on what your choice is, and\nthose are scenarios that you may actually\n\n587\n00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,530\nchoose to take a look at, depending\non the edition that you need here.\n\n588\n00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,140\nOkay?\n\n589\n00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,620\nSo, Nate,\nwhich one are we gonna start off with?\n\n590\n00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,750\nYou actually do have both\nWindows 8.1 as well as.\n\n591\n00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,560\nServer 2012 to enable the feature.\n\n592\n00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,510\nSo which one do we want them to do?\n\n593\n00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,570\nYou know, we can do Server for\neveryone first.\n\n594\n00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,796\n[CROSSTALK] I mean,\nit really doesn't matter either way.\n\n595\n00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:34,060\nSo on my machine here,\n\n596\n00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,860\nwe do have some stand alone computers,\nthey're off-site here.\n\n597\n00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,070\nAnd so we're going to remote\ndesktop into these guys and\n\n598\n00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,760\nfirst ones first we'll go ahead and\ninstall it into a Windows server.\n\n599\n00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,200\nAnd for Windows server,\n\n600\n00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,700\nwe can just open up Windows server manager\nhere and in server manager we can go and\n\n601\n00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,020\nlook at all of our stuff and go to our\ndashboard and get an overview on things.\n\n602\n00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,160\nBut what we are after.\n\n603\n00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,470\nIs up here on the manage, and\nthen we will add roles and features.\n\n604\n00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,930\nAnd we get our little wizard here, and\nwe will click on next in our wizard.\n\n605\n00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:20,160\nAnd we'll just click on next on this\nscreen and on our server selection,\n\n606\n00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,160\nwe're working with this one,\nso we'll click on next again.\n\n607\n00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,040\nAnd here we go.\n\n608\n00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,930\nSo now in our server rules, we got this\nguy down here, right there, Hyper V.\n\n609\n00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,485\nSo we'll click on that,\nit's gonna want to install some of\n\n610\n00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:37,505\nthe management tools along with it,\nlike how to read manager, which, you know,\n\n611\n00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:42,555\nwe won't need to use it unless we,\nyou know, remotely knew it but,\n\n612\n00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:48,087\nwe need this guy so we will add those\nfeatures and we will click on next.\n\n613\n00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:52,367\nWe're not going to add any other features\nat this point, so we'll next through it.\n\n614\n00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:55,237\nAnd we will next again.\n\n615\n00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:55,797\nAlright.\n\n616\n00:34:55,797 --> 00:34:57,107\nSo, for\n\n617\n00:34:57,107 --> 00:35:02,070\nthis stuff we're going to set up some of\nthose initial things along with hyper v.\n\n618\n00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:08,330\nSo for well I guess some of this would be\nbeneficial to see it within the client.\n\n619\n00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,549\nSo we won't give it any network\nadapters at this point.\n\n620\n00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,040\nAnd we won't really set up any\nlive migrations at this point.\n\n621\n00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,180\nAnd now, for these default stores,\n\n622\n00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,020\nwe can change,\nshould we change these like within?\n\n623\n00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,770\nLet's go ahead and change them.\n\n624\n00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,350\nAll right, change them right now?\n\n625\n00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,710\nNo, you can change them later on.\n\n626\n00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,700\nIf you didn't want to change them,\n\n627\n00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,380\nwe'll go ahead and sometimes you may\nactually want to choose to store your\n\n628\n00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,370\nbigger virtual machines in\na different location then default,\n\n629\n00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,720\nthis is where you can do it or you can do\nit later on either way it is possible.\n\n630\n00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,460\n<< We will just do it here\nwhile we are all right here.\n\n631\n00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,360\nSo the default location for\nthe virtual hard disk files.\n\n632\n00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,510\nNow for a virtual hard disk,\nwhich we'll get into more.\n\n633\n00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,210\nWhat's so funny?\n\n634\n00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:55,980\nSounds good.\n\n635\n00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,730\nRight?\nGood, okay.\n\n636\n00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,530\nSo these virtual hard disks they will\nappear as just a single file- Yeah.\n\n637\n00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,120\nTo the host OS right.\n\n638\n00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,030\nSo our host operating system\nthat's running HyperV.\n\n639\n00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,960\nTo the guest operating system, it'll\nappear as just a full-fledged hard drive.\n\n640\n00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,780\nSo that's what it means by\nthe virtual hard drive files.\n\n641\n00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:25,960\nAnd for this one we will create a new\nfolder called virtuals and then VHDs.\n\n642\n00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,050\nAll right.\nSounds good.\n\n643\n00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:30,410\nAnd for\nthe virtual machine configuration files,\n\n644\n00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,680\nwe will create a folder\ncalled virtuals and\n\n645\n00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,790\nwe'll call this one VMs,\nor virtual machines.\n\n646\n00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,660\nSo I have our virtual machine,\nour configuration files, some of the files\n\n647\n00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:51,125\nthat tell the host OS what hardware it\nhas and, you know, just the settings.\n\n648\n00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,855\nIt's once we get into the Hyper-V manager,\nlike I said,\n\n649\n00:36:53,855 --> 00:36:55,835\nwe'll put a face with the name.\n\n650\n00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:59,635\nThe VMs will go in one spot and\nthe VHDs will go in another spot.\n\n651\n00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,170\nWe'll click on next.\n\n652\n00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:06,410\nAnd I'm pretty sure that we will\nneed to restart that server at\n\n653\n00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,880\nleast once to install that hyper visor.\n\n654\n00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,880\nSo click on that and we will click on\ninstall and let this guy churn away.\n\n655\n00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,680\nYeah.\nNow,\n\n656\n00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,860\nthe installation of this is\nrelatively straight-forward, right?\n\n657\n00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,390\nWe walk through the ad-servers and\nfeatures role for us.\n\n658\n00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,430\nAnd we choose the actual features\nthat we want to actually install\n\n659\n00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,250\nand what we can do.\n\n660\n00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,500\nNotice it gives us some\nbasic configuration.\n\n661\n00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,640\nJust because we can actually\nenter in some configurations now\n\n662\n00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,510\ndoesn't mean we can't\nchange them later on but\n\n663\n00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,440\nit's actually giving us a default,\nis what we might actually choose to do.\n\n664\n00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,270\nWith this particular process on\ninstalling this particular server role,\n\n665\n00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,980\nit's not gonna take too long for\nit to install.\n\n666\n00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,620\nThe nice thing about the way that\nWindows actually manages this,\n\n667\n00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,260\nright, is the ability of course,\nfor us to go ahead and\n\n668\n00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,900\ninstall it just like we would any other\nrole like a DNS server or a DHCP server.\n\n669\n00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,490\nAnd I'm assuming that since it kicked\noff it, it's probably restarting.\n\n670\n00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,750\nAnd that's what we have here.\n\n671\n00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,750\nSo it's actually restarting and\nactually doing everything.\n\n672\n00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:09,330\nNow the interesting thing about\nthe way that the hyperview works here.\n\n673\n00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,160\nOn the Windows server 2012.\n\n674\n00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,580\nIs that we began with\nan operating system right there.\n\n675\n00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,790\nOn the bare metal.\n\n676\n00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,750\nSo it was just a nonvirtualized\nmachine at this point.\n\n677\n00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,555\nAnd what it would seem like, then,\nif we're installing the Hyper-V roll,\n\n678\n00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:28,660\nthat this would make it just\na type two hyper visor.\n\n679\n00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,310\nSo just like what we talked about here.\n\n680\n00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,680\nThat we're installing it on top\nof the existing operating system.\n\n681\n00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,540\nBut the way that Windows Server\n2012 ends up working, and\n\n682\n00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,730\neven in previous editions\nof Windows Server.\n\n683\n00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,570\nIs that it actually changes it.\n\n684\n00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,320\nSo during this installation, this reboot\nprocess, it's now going to actually take\n\n685\n00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,610\nthat hyper-V, that hypervisor,\nand actually put it below,\n\n686\n00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,020\ndirectly on top of the hardware and\nnow run the host operating system,\n\n687\n00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,880\nthe one that Nate was just working in\non top of that and that will now manage\n\n688\n00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,010\nthe way that the actual other virtual\nmachines that Nate will create to be able\n\n689\n00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:08,410\nto access the hardware as well\nto manage the control on that.\n\n690\n00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:13,924\nSo it's actually kind of a neat process in\nhow the operating system that Nate will\n\n691\n00:39:13,924 --> 00:39:19,730\nreboot into is actually a virtual machine\nthat is running on top of the hyper visor.\n\n692\n00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,060\nSo let's go ahead and\nturn on Hyper-V for For the client.\n\n693\n00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,630\nSounds good.\n\n694\n00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,760\nThat will work.\n\n695\n00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,500\nYup.\nSo on this machine here, so\n\n696\n00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,070\nwe'll go ahead and open up the last\nremaining remote desktop that we have.\n\n697\n00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,540\nAnd on this guy let me click\non that because it bugs.\n\n698\n00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:40,180\nAnd so what we will do then to\nturn that on, it is a feature so\n\n699\n00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:45,660\nwe'll go to programs and features.\n\n700\n00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,030\nThere we go, programs and features.\n\n701\n00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,100\nAnd now Hyper- V is so\nit's not installed by default.\n\n702\n00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,650\nAnd so we want to turn Windows\nfeatures on or off, right?\n\n703\n00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,570\nSo that guy right there.\n\n704\n00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,710\nThat's it.\nWe will click on that and\n\n705\n00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,270\nin this window there we go.\n\n706\n00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,280\nRight there.\nHyper-V.\n\n707\n00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,120\nNow we do get a little drop down here.\n\n708\n00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,913\nSo we got the the management tools\nwhere it's at is the hyper v manager.\n\n709\n00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:10,242\nSo we do want to include that so\n\n710\n00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:15,370\nthose are tools in the The PowerShell\nstuff, I believe we will get\n\n711\n00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:21,820\ninto some PowerShell commands to\nmanage some of this stuff here later.\n\n712\n00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,890\nSo I'll just go ahead and\ncollapse all of this, and\n\n713\n00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,640\njust click that one box which\nwill include, oh, it doesn't say.\n\n714\n00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,810\nIt looks like it's,\nis that guy, no, included?\n\n715\n00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,320\nAll right, there we go.\n\n716\n00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,449\nAnd we will click on OK.\n\n717\n00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:46,297\nYep, so now it's actually searching for\nthe install files that it actually needs\n\n718\n00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:49,840\nto go ahead and\nenable the Hyper-V role as well, okay.\n\n719\n00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,310\nSo during this particular process as\nit's doing that, It should install\n\n720\n00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:58,010\njust about the same way that we saw that\nthe actual Windows server did, too, okay.\n\n721\n00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:02,288\nAll right, so after this stuff installs,\n\n722\n00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:06,160\nnow that server's gonna take a reboot or\ntwo.\n\n723\n00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,040\nAnd so this guy says if he should know.\n\n724\n00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,570\nThere might be something up\nwith our machine there, Ronnie,\n\n725\n00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,140\nbecause I am pretty sure that\nis the one that we need.\n\n726\n00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,300\nAnd it says that it cannot be installed,\n\n727\n00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,190\nthe processor does not\nhave SLAT capabilities.\n\n728\n00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,890\nIt may not actually be able to do it.\n\n729\n00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,740\nSo that may be one of the features\nthat we've run into as well.\n\n730\n00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,220\nSo what we would probably need to do and\nIt's almost a good time for\n\n731\n00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,550\nus to take a break, anyways.\n\n732\n00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:34,820\nLet's check and see if that action machine\ncan support the SLAT capabilities.\n\n733\n00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,890\nIt may be able to, it may not.\n\n734\n00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,890\nYeah, if anything, on our XPS right here\nit does kind of mess around with our\n\n735\n00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,810\nscreen sharing software a little bit but\nwe may just do that.\n\n736\n00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,530\nTurn it on, on the XPS here.\n\n737\n00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:55,935\nWe'll just have to be a little delicate\nwith our screen sharing software.\n\n738\n00:41:55,935 --> 00:41:56,840\nSounds good.\n\n739\n00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,380\nAll right, well,\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n740\n00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,460\nWe'll take our break here.\n\n741\n00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,284\nWe'll wait for these machines to\nfinish their reboot and, Ronnie,\n\n742\n00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:07,220\nso let's jump into that machine out there\nand see if we can't get it installed.\n\n743\n00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,390\nSounds good.\n\n744\n00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,223\nSweet.\nAll right, so,\n\n745\n00:42:09,223 --> 00:42:10,689\nwe'll get to that stuff after the break.\n\n746\n00:42:10,689 --> 00:42:14,950\n[MUSIC]\n\n747\n00:42:17,516 --> 00:42:19,830\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n748\n00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,560\nSo during the break Ronnie and\nI we pulled up the processor for\n\n749\n00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,920\nthat machine there and looked it up\non Intel 's little arc sheet and\n\n750\n00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,380\nsure enough it does not support SLAT.\n\n751\n00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,410\nSo that was a little hindsight there.\n\n752\n00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,730\nWe weren't able to get\nHyper-V installed on there.\n\n753\n00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,700\nBut there's an irony behind this, right.\n\n754\n00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,405\nSo because a client, Windows 8.1 client,\nif you're gonna do Hyper-V,\n\n755\n00:42:44,405 --> 00:42:46,975\nit requires that second\nlevel address translation.\n\n756\n00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:51,595\nThe funny thing about it, at least I think\nso, is that Windows Server 2012 R2 though,\n\n757\n00:42:51,595 --> 00:42:52,310\ndoesn't.\n\n758\n00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,590\nSo we can actually install that perfectly\nfine on the machines that we have.\n\n759\n00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,800\nThat will run perfectly fine, but\nthe client absolutely requires it.\n\n760\n00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,770\nSo that's where we had a problem.\n\n761\n00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:03,490\nBut even so, we have that,\nthe good thing is Nate has a machine\n\n762\n00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,600\nthat does support the second level address\ntranslation, and so that means he can\n\n763\n00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,440\nstill show us what he wanted to,\nwhich is installing it on Windows 8.1.\n\n764\n00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,270\nYep, so let's go and do that.\n\n765\n00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:18,270\nSo on my machine here, and yeah, so\nhopefully it doesn't interfere with\n\n766\n00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:22,470\nour screen sharing software too much,\nwhich it's been pretty good in the past.\n\n767\n00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:28,770\nAll right, so\nwe'll go back into Programs > Features.\n\n768\n00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:35,379\nAnd we will turn our Windows\nfeatures on and off and in Hyper-V,\n\n769\n00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:39,500\noh, had a little square there,\nlike, oh, no, please.\n\n770\n00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,360\nAnd so, there we go.\n\n771\n00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,750\nSo, there's the Hyper-V platform.\n\n772\n00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,010\nWe will check that, and we will click OK.\n\n773\n00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,550\nLet's go through and\ninstall those files now.\n\n774\n00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:51,890\nHopefully, the files that it\nneeds is already on here.\n\n775\n00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,430\nSo I don't think I have any\ninstallation media handy for\n\n776\n00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,670\nit to pull those files off of.\n\n777\n00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,415\nAnd then, yeah, we'll just let this\nguy go ahead and start and oh, geez,\n\n778\n00:44:00,415 --> 00:44:01,610\nthat was awfully fast!\n\n779\n00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:10,230\nNow, this PC, it will take a couple\nof reboots to finish installing.\n\n780\n00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:15,590\nSo it needs to install the Hyper-Visor and\nso it will take a couple of reboots.\n\n781\n00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:20,030\nNow, Ronnie,\nshould we go ahead and reboot now?\n\n782\n00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,550\nLet's go ahead and reboot.\n\n783\n00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,300\nTurn off your screen sharing software.\n\n784\n00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,870\nBut we can actually jump\nover to my machine.\n\n785\n00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,609\nAnd we can check out the Windows\n2012 Server as we're actually doing\n\n786\n00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:29,412\nthis, right.\n\n787\n00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:29,979\nYup.\n\n788\n00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:32,615\nAnd that guy is on 29.\n\n789\n00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:33,917\n29?\n\n790\n00:44:33,917 --> 00:44:35,216\n230.29 or is it-?\n\n791\n00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:36,045\nCorrect.\n\n792\n00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:36,850\n230.29.\n\n793\n00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,970\nAnd we'll connect here.\n\n794\n00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,610\nAnd then connect back in.\n\n795\n00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:47,590\nRemember that this is actually\nthe Windows 2012 machine that we started\n\n796\n00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,570\nthe Hyper-V install role on.\n\n797\n00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,570\nAnd so what is the- I don't\nthink I made you an account.\n\n798\n00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,130\nSo just put in Nathan.\n\n799\n00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,550\nAnd pounds for that I use for everything.\n\n800\n00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,800\nYour secret password?\n\n801\n00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,400\nSuper secret password?\n\n802\n00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,600\nIt's not a secret anymore if you know it.\n\n803\n00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,046\nYour super secret password,\nwhat's the name of the machine?\n\n804\n00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:07,670\nHyper-V.\n\n805\n00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,265\nHyper-V, Nathan?\n\n806\n00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:19,215\nMan, this XPS has a solve state,\noh, okay, never mind.\n\n807\n00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:20,385\nYeah.\nI was gonna say, man,\n\n808\n00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,675\nby the time you get that thing.\n\n809\n00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:25,385\nThat's because of my typing abilities\nnot because of the performance of\n\n810\n00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:26,575\nthe machine itself.\n\n811\n00:45:26,575 --> 00:45:28,960\nRight.\nSo, yeah, if I could spell it would help.\n\n812\n00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,710\nUnless you know what your password\nword will help you even faster.\n\n813\n00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,757\nRight.\nAll right, so\n\n814\n00:45:32,757 --> 00:45:34,063\nhere we are on this machine and\n\n815\n00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,939\nyou said that now that we'll take\n[INAUDIBLE], the only thing I'm\n\n816\n00:45:36,939 --> 00:45:41,160\ndoing right now is just verifying that the\nHyper-V role was successfully installed.\n\n817\n00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,720\nInside of the server manager,\nI can see the link for it right over here.\n\n818\n00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,100\nAnd it looks like everything\nis actually good.\n\n819\n00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,620\nAre you telling me that it's done\non the client side there, Nate?\n\n820\n00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,660\nWell, no.\nI think it's in the second or\n\n821\n00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,214\nthird reboot,\nI think this is the last one.\n\n822\n00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,830\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this, okay?\n\n823\n00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,010\nSo now that it's successfully installed,\nright.\n\n824\n00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,940\nOne of the things you need\nto be able to do, of course,\n\n825\n00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:07,510\nis to understand how to go about using\nthe actual Hyper-V interface, okay.\n\n826\n00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:11,310\nSo on your Server 2012 machine as you're\nrunning it, right, you're gonna be inside\n\n827\n00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,110\nthe of server manager and, of course,\nyou can actually click on the link here.\n\n828\n00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,040\nMine automatically popped up here.\n\n829\n00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,390\nSo I can click on the server manager\nlink that's on my task bar, and\n\n830\n00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,270\nyou'll notice that will populate all\nthe server roles that are actually\n\n831\n00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,300\ninstalled on this machine, currently.\n\n832\n00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,010\nUsually if you're running\nHyper-V on the machine,\n\n833\n00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,600\nthe recommendation is that you\ndon't actually install other roles.\n\n834\n00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,260\nCan you?\n\n835\n00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,200\nYes, but normally you actually just wanna\nleave it as being the Hyper-V role here.\n\n836\n00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,490\nSo, if I go ahead and click over on\nthe left-hand side of the navigation pane\n\n837\n00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,290\nunder Hyper-V, okay,\nyou'll notice it changes and\n\n838\n00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:46,520\ntells me that I am now in the Hyper-V\nrole here under the servers.\n\n839\n00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,750\nAnd I can right-click on the Hyper-V\nlink here in the center,\n\n840\n00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,748\nand what we're looking for\nis down under Hyper-V Manager,\n\n841\n00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:58,780\nis what we're really taking a look at,\nat this point.\n\n842\n00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,880\nSo if I go ahead and select that.\n\n843\n00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,010\nNow, in terms of the Hyper-V Manager,\nokay, whether you're actually on\n\n844\n00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:09,638\nWindows Server 2012 or\nwhether you're actually in the Windows 8.1\n\n845\n00:47:09,638 --> 00:47:13,260\nclient attribute, you'll see that\nthe experience is pretty much identical.\n\n846\n00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,550\nIt looks the same,\n\n847\n00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,050\nthe setup pretty much is the same here\nin terms of the management, okay.\n\n848\n00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:21,430\nAgain, there are some feature differences\nin terms of how many things you can do at\n\n849\n00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:26,187\none time but besides that though, you'll\nprobably see the same thing here, okay.\n\n850\n00:47:26,187 --> 00:47:30,550\nSo this three-pane management console that\nwe have here, that's pretty much standard\n\n851\n00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,290\nthroughout most of the Microsoft world,\nor the Windows world here, right.\n\n852\n00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,670\nWe have a navigation pane\nover on the left hand side,\n\n853\n00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,460\nwe have an action pane over here\non the right hand side, and\n\n854\n00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,250\nin the middle,\nthe details of what we can actually see.\n\n855\n00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,400\nThe number of virtual machines right now,\n\n856\n00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,520\nwe don't have any virtual\nmachines created.\n\n857\n00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,998\nWe also have the idea of what we call\ncheckpoints, and we'll talk about those\n\n858\n00:47:49,998 --> 00:47:53,369\na little bit later on when we do create\nvirtual machines and then even some of\n\n859\n00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:56,389\nthe characteristic details of\nthat machine that we've created.\n\n860\n00:47:56,389 --> 00:48:01,730\nSo if you are running multiple\ncomputers that are running Hyper-V,\n\n861\n00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:06,609\nyou, of course, can actually\ncontinue to add in multiple ones\n\n862\n00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:09,844\nover here on the left-hand side, okay.\n\n863\n00:48:09,844 --> 00:48:12,607\nBy connecting to another server,\nwe don't have one.\n\n864\n00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:13,989\nBut we would simply select that.\n\n865\n00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:17,640\nAnd then we would type in the name or\nthe IP address of that one.\n\n866\n00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:22,110\nAnd that would add in a second node\nover here on the left hand side for us.\n\n867\n00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,850\nAnd that way we could actually\nmanage the virtual machines on\n\n868\n00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,530\neach of those two computers.\n\n869\n00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,990\nOr multiple ones as well.\n\n870\n00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,800\nSo, we're just doing the basic\nsetup at this point.\n\n871\n00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,040\nWe're just trying introduce you\nto the interface here, okay.\n\n872\n00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,770\nSo, once I've selected\nby clicking on Hyper-V,\n\n873\n00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:41,840\nyou'll notice that the action pane kind of\nchanged over here on the right hand side.\n\n874\n00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,850\nIf I just select the Hyper-V manager\nnotice the action pane changes as well.\n\n875\n00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,530\nSo we just see a more generic version.\n\n876\n00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,890\nIf I select Hyper V, you'll now see\nthat there are many different things.\n\n877\n00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:57,660\nThat we can actually do inside of\nthe actual Hyper-V manager here.\n\n878\n00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,930\nIs what we're taking a look at so far.\n\n879\n00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:05,340\nSo notice that if I wanted to\ncreate a new virtual machine or\n\n880\n00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,560\nactually create even just a virtual\nhard drive, or go ahead and\n\n881\n00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,090\nactually do a virtual floppy disk\nWe can do all that right there.\n\n882\n00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,990\nVery easily for us to take a look at.\n\n883\n00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,830\nWe'll kind of get into that when\nwe get into creating the virtual\n\n884\n00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,921\nmachine a little bit later, but\nthat's one the options that we have.\n\n885\n00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,710\nWe of course can input a virtual\nmachine if I already have another one.\n\n886\n00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,240\nNotice it launches up and\n\n887\n00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,640\ngives me of course access to a nice\nlittle wizard system that I have.\n\n888\n00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,833\nAnd notice this says, hey,\nbefore you begin this is what you do,\n\n889\n00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:37,029\nlocate where that's gonna be,\nselect the machine you want, and\n\n890\n00:49:37,029 --> 00:49:40,300\nchoose the way that it's\ngonna import as well.\n\n891\n00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,160\nBut where it really\nbegins to get detailed,\n\n892\n00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,540\nof course,\nis in the Hyper V settings here.\n\n893\n00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,790\nIf I select that, now,\nnotice it's the control settings for\n\n894\n00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,125\nthe entire server here.\n\n895\n00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:56,330\nHyper-V settings for Hyper-V itself.\n\n896\n00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:01,390\nAnd this is where, when Nate set\nthis up during the install process,\n\n897\n00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,100\nthat we changed a couple of\nthe default settings here\n\n898\n00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,170\non the virtual hard disk here in terms\nof where we're gonna store these.\n\n899\n00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:12,830\nRemember that virtual hard drives\nare essentially files to the host machine.\n\n900\n00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,920\nSo on the machine that I'm running the\nHyper-V server, that server doesn't see\n\n901\n00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,050\nthese as real hard drives that\nserver sees these as being files and\n\n902\n00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,495\nwhat Nate did is again,\nchange it to a default location.\n\n903\n00:50:24,495 --> 00:50:27,995\nOr change the default to this new\nfolder structure that he went ahead and\n\n904\n00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:28,789\ncreated right here.\n\n905\n00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:32,506\nUnder virtuals slash VHD.\n\n906\n00:50:32,506 --> 00:50:36,498\nIf I wanted to browse into it, I could\nactually see it again using the file\n\n907\n00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:40,753\nexplorer and there's nothing in it\nbecause we haven't created anything and\n\n908\n00:50:40,753 --> 00:50:45,468\nthere's also, of course, the configuration\nfiles that Nate was also mentioning,\n\n909\n00:50:45,468 --> 00:50:47,777\nright there and then you can change this.\n\n910\n00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:49,860\nNow we don't have anything\nthat we're changing here.\n\n911\n00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,120\nSo managing remote FX.\n\n912\n00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,380\nThese are a different effects that\nwe actually have the GPU's here.\n\n913\n00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,760\nNotice that we don't have anything.\n\n914\n00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,000\nSo we can't really change that one.\n\n915\n00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,140\nAnd now we have this unusual thing.\n\n916\n00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,660\nThe non-uniform management access.\n\n917\n00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,390\nI've made,\nnon uniform memory architecture.\n\n918\n00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,300\nSo, a lot of times you have virtual\nmachines that have been created, again,\n\n919\n00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,180\nacross multiple different platforms here.\n\n920\n00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,820\nIt's actually giving you\nthat ability to span those.\n\n921\n00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,830\nIn other words,\nto be able to manage those as well.\n\n922\n00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,130\nTo bring them in if you need to.\n\n923\n00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,150\nAnd we're not talking\nabout live migrations,\n\n924\n00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:29,360\nwe may go into that later on in a future\nepisode in terms of hyper v when\n\n925\n00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,330\nwe start talking about\nthe idea of clustering.\n\n926\n00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:35,570\nBut it gives us the ability again to move\nthose virtual machines from one particular\n\n927\n00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:39,380\nserver over to another one here without\nhaving to shutdown the machines as well.\n\n928\n00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:44,620\nAnd then of course the idea of\nstorage migration is another one too.\n\n929\n00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,570\nAgain moving the actual storage\nof where one server is located.\n\n930\n00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:54,060\nAnd then of course policies that\nwe can have and again replication.\n\n931\n00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,130\nAnd these are more advanced topics\nthat we'll probably cover in\n\n932\n00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,190\na later episode that we have.\n\n933\n00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:03,010\nYou know Ronnie with that live migration,\nit's incredibly cool.\n\n934\n00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:05,420\nAnd we can have a virtual machine.\n\n935\n00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,620\nRunning on one server and\nbe able to migrate it,\n\n936\n00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:15,740\nbe able to move that machine over to\nanother server, and still have it running.\n\n937\n00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,950\nYeah.\nIncredibly awesome,\n\n938\n00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:22,740\nthat we can move things around from\nserver maintenance or who knows what.\n\n939\n00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,300\nMaybe bring something up or take something\ndown, and to be able to move those\n\n940\n00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,180\nmachines over, and to the end user who may\nbe in a cubicle somewhere logged into it,\n\n941\n00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:36,120\nor someone using it somewhere,\ncan be able to move it from one\n\n942\n00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:41,610\nsystem to another system, and with the end\nuser not really knowing anything about it.\n\n943\n00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,150\nThat's pretty awesome.\n\n944\n00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,580\nYeah.\nIt makes it very easy,\n\n945\n00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,030\nlike we talked about in\nterms of maintenance,\n\n946\n00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,020\njust like what Nate just said here.\n\n947\n00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,890\nThe other one, of course,\n\n948\n00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:53,240\nis if you actually have one server that\nmay not actually be dividing its workload\n\n949\n00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,690\nfairly easily here, we could actually\nmove it over to another server that may\n\n950\n00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,570\nactually be able to handle the workload\na little bit better, as well,\n\n951\n00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:04,760\nwithout really impacting the end user\ntoo much, sometimes you may experience\n\n952\n00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,140\nsome little performance hit every now and\nthen, but not necessarily.\n\n953\n00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,920\nSo lab migration's pretty unique here.\n\n954\n00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,960\nBut the overall manager feature though,\n\n955\n00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,550\nyou see where there's a lot of different\nthings that you can do right away.\n\n956\n00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:22,310\nAnd again, you can even control how\nthe user interacts with it, too.\n\n957\n00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,740\nSo not only the server\nin terms of managing it.\n\n958\n00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:29,590\nBut also the way that we interface with it\nin terms of the keyboard, the mouse, and\n\n959\n00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:33,130\nof course, other modes here,\nthe enhanced mode.\n\n960\n00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,190\nTo be able to operate that and\n\n961\n00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,750\nthen of course to reset all\nthese settings if we need too.\n\n962\n00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:43,100\nThat is the overall management\nconsole that we have here.\n\n963\n00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,000\nNate, is there anything else we wanna\npoint out on this that you can think of?\n\n964\n00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,300\nNo, that does look pretty good.\n\n965\n00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,330\nNow Mm-hm.\n\n966\n00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,485\nSo this on the server side.\n\n967\n00:53:53,485 --> 00:53:54,030\nMm-hm.\n\n968\n00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,570\nAll right, now let's say with\nHyper-V on the client side.\n\n969\n00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,470\nOkay.\nSo on my machine it did finish,\n\n970\n00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,150\nwe did finish rebooting it Four or\nfive times.\n\n971\n00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:05,720\n[LAUGH] And so\nnow up here to get to hyperview manager,\n\n972\n00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,720\nI am a big fan of the search.\n\n973\n00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,860\nSo just click on Start to\nget to our Start screen.\n\n974\n00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,860\nAnd then Hyper.\n\n975\n00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,700\nStart typing in Hyper we get Hyper-V.\n\n976\n00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,950\nW have the virtual machine connection.\n\n977\n00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:19,920\nWe won't get into that right now.\n\n978\n00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,130\nBut we do have the Hyper V manager\nwhich is what Ronnie was in, and\n\n979\n00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:28,660\nlaunching up it looks just\nabout near identical.\n\n980\n00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:34,030\nThere will be some features that may or\nmay not be in there.\n\n981\n00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:39,030\nBut you know of our stuff,\nwe can get into hyper v settings.\n\n982\n00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,560\nAnd on here we see that we\ndon't get that live migration.\n\n983\n00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,290\nWe don't get a lot of those features in\nthere that we saw on the server side.\n\n984\n00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:50,780\nA little bit more stripped down,\nwe can change where our hard discs are.\n\n985\n00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,680\nWe got that numis banding and\nour storage migrations.\n\n986\n00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,390\nAnd our enhanced session mode policy.\n\n987\n00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,550\nWhich is pretty cool.\n\n988\n00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:00,030\nIt'll enhanced session mode policy.\n\n989\n00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:06,660\nNormally when we connect to a virtual\nmachine, we connect to it as the console.\n\n990\n00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:11,970\nAnd so by using enhanced session\nmode policy, it basically, when\n\n991\n00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:16,630\nwe connect the virtual machine, it does\nit using RDP, or remote desktop Protocol.\n\n992\n00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:21,300\nAnd so we get a, I'd say just a bit\ndifferent experience with Dancer.\n\n993\n00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:21,810\nYep fancier.\n\n994\n00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,460\nYep fancier things share\nour clipboards and\n\n995\n00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,065\nsome of the other stuff we get with RDP.\n\n996\n00:55:26,065 --> 00:55:26,980\nMm-hm.\n\n997\n00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:31,620\nBut that's, yeah,\nfrom the client side of hyper view.\n\n998\n00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,590\nYeah.\nThose are all the settings that we get.\n\n999\n00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:39,500\nSo generally in the server there's\na lot more options there but\n\n1000\n00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,060\nas far as the Hyper-V manager itself\nwe do have virtual machines up here,\n\n1001\n00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,960\nwhich I just installed, so\nwe have none and no check points for\n\n1002\n00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,770\nthe virtual machines,\nwe don't have any of.\n\n1003\n00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:53,336\nand down in the details pane down here,\nwe would get a little thumbnail of our\n\n1004\n00:55:53,336 --> 00:55:55,637\nvirtual machine as its running,\npretty sweet.\n\n1005\n00:55:55,637 --> 00:55:58,045\nAs the virtual machine runs,\n\n1006\n00:55:58,045 --> 00:56:02,870\nwe get a screenshot of the console,\nof its little desktop.\n\n1007\n00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:07,032\nAnd then depending on if we do have\na virtual machine selected and\n\n1008\n00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:10,360\nover in the actions pane\nwe can change some of them.\n\n1009\n00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:16,780\nNow we do have some options over here,\nyou know, like the virtual switch manager.\n\n1010\n00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,780\nWe can make virtual switches for\nour virtual machines and Ronnie\n\n1011\n00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:25,030\nif I'm not mistaken I believe when we do\nget into creating these virtual machines.\n\n1012\n00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,970\nThat's where the meat of all\nof this is going to come from.\n\n1013\n00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:30,900\nYep, for our networking we'll make sure\nwe get into that and cover some of\n\n1014\n00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,710\nthe different details on how we actually\ndo connect our virtual machines to either\n\n1015\n00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,910\nour physical network or we might want to\nisolate them to a private network instead.\n\n1016\n00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:43,680\nNow Ronnie what I did do in\nthe background, I'll just minimize this.\n\n1017\n00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,180\nWe do have a server here,\na VM host we call this guy,\n\n1018\n00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,228\nthat we have running that has a lot\nof virtual machines that it hosts.\n\n1019\n00:56:51,228 --> 00:56:56,230\nYou know, Ronnie and I, we use some of\nthese virtual machines for demos and\n\n1020\n00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:00,390\nlabs, things that we can, we can break and\nwe won't feel bad about it,\n\n1021\n00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:05,100\ncuz we can either revert these virtual\nmachines to an earlier checkpoint, or\n\n1022\n00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,890\nwe can just wipe them out altogether.\n\n1023\n00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,730\nPretty convenient.\n\n1024\n00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,940\nYes.\n\n1025\n00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:16,420\nSo I did log into that,\noops, just kidding.\n\n1026\n00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,510\nAll right, here we go.\n\n1027\n00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:24,200\nSo, this is on a 2002 R2 Server, and it's\ndata center, I believe, on this guy here.\n\n1028\n00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,774\nAnd to get down to it,\njust like what Ronnie was doing,\n\n1029\n00:57:27,774 --> 00:57:31,285\nwe had to fire up good old server manager.\n\n1030\n00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:34,145\nAnd once this guy starts up and populates,\n\n1031\n00:57:34,145 --> 00:57:38,845\nwe do have the Hyper-V,\nnode is that what you call it?\n\n1032\n00:57:38,845 --> 00:57:39,345\nRole.\n\n1033\n00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:39,965\nRole, yup.\n\n1034\n00:57:39,965 --> 00:57:40,810\nOver here.\n\n1035\n00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:46,820\nAnd so we click on this guy, and\nthen over here with the VM host we can.\n\n1036\n00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,690\nThere's a lot of IP addresses\nthat we've got there.\n\n1037\n00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:49,570\nYeah, there's is.\n\n1038\n00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:55,350\nWe've set up a Nick Teaming and\nprior episodes set this stuff up.\n\n1039\n00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,560\nAnd so we can right click on this guy and\ngo down to Hyper-V manager.\n\n1040\n00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,260\nWe can also get to it through\nthe tools in Hyper-V manager.\n\n1041\n00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:06,560\nI am just really used to right\nclicking and choosing it this way.\n\n1042\n00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:13,920\nAnd firing this guy up now we can\nsee that on our virtual machines,\n\n1043\n00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,350\nwe have some under here.\n\n1044\n00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:18,440\nWe've got this guy here\na domain controller.\n\n1045\n00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,110\nThis guy is running.\n\n1046\n00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:22,140\nIts CPU usage is sitting at 0%, all right,\n\n1047\n00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:27,000\nso this guy's just sitting idle,\nwe do have the amount of memory.\n\n1048\n00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,300\nNow, of the stuff that we can virtualize,\n\n1049\n00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:35,480\none thing that we cannot\nvirtualize is RAM.\n\n1050\n00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,625\nSo we cannot give a machine more\nmemory than what we actually have.\n\n1051\n00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,030\nHard drives,\nwe can virtualize hard drives.\n\n1052\n00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:46,119\nWe can give a virtual machine a 3,\n4, 8, 9, 12,\n\n1053\n00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:51,080\n20 terabyte hard drive when we\nonly have a 1 terabyte hard drive.\n\n1054\n00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,110\nAnd so, we can set that up.\n\n1055\n00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,430\nNow of course,\nwe can't write 20 terabytes of data\n\n1056\n00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:59,070\nif we only have one terabyte\navailable on a physical disk.\n\n1057\n00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:03,460\nBut one thing we can assign more of,\nand that is RAM.\n\n1058\n00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,390\nSo this guy's only eating up 1 GB of RAM.\n\n1059\n00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:10,330\nAnd here he has been up yeah,\nfour hours or four days, 16 hours.\n\n1060\n00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:11,770\nThat's four days, yeah.\n\n1061\n00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,760\nFour days he's been sitting there.\n\n1062\n00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,050\nFour days, I wonder,\nI wonder if it rebooted?\n\n1063\n00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:16,920\nProbably did.\n\n1064\n00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,300\nProbably.\n\n1065\n00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,752\nSo we've got some other\nmachines down here, some in,\n\n1066\n00:59:21,752 --> 00:59:24,090\noff state, so they're power down.\n\n1067\n00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:28,480\nNow, with these virtual machines,\nthink of them as a real computer,\n\n1068\n00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:35,280\nas a physical computer,\ncuz it behaves like it is a real machine.\n\n1069\n00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,660\nSo this guy, he is powered off.\n\n1070\n00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:43,700\nOn the saved estate, this one,\nit was reverted from a checkpoint.\n\n1071\n00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:49,140\nAnd so it saved, like in this one,\nlike a hibernation sort of thing.\n\n1072\n00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,680\nSee down here we have\nsome Windows 7 machines.\n\n1073\n00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,040\nSo these guys are currently running, and\n\n1074\n00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,940\nif I click on them, then these guys\nthey don't have any checkpoints, or\n\n1075\n01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:05,890\nsnapshots, these are just\nlike a quick little image,\n\n1076\n01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:09,530\nmore or less, of it's current\nconfiguration, it's running state.\n\n1077\n01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:15,000\nSo if we were to make any changes to this\nvirtual machine, we can revert Back so\n\n1078\n01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,522\nkind of like a system restore more or\nless.\n\n1079\n01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:22,130\nSo we can revert that\nvirtual machine back.\n\n1080\n01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:27,150\nSo this guy doesn't have any, so\nwe've given him a bit more RAM and\n\n1081\n01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,930\nhe's up there and running.\n\n1082\n01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:35,030\nSo, as these virtual machines,\njust the configuration files themselves.\n\n1083\n01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:38,560\nThey don't take up a whole lot of space,\nI mean we could have many,\n\n1084\n01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,580\nmany virtual machines now because\nwe can't virtualize more RAM.\n\n1085\n01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:48,140\nThis current machine we have right\nhere only has 8 gigabytes of RAM.\n\n1086\n01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:53,320\nSo we could only spin up three virtual\nmachines before we run out of RAM.\n\n1087\n01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:59,090\nEven though we only have what,\n3 gigabytes there and 1 gigabyte there.\n\n1088\n01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:03,370\nOur post operating system\nalso needs its RAM.\n\n1089\n01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,560\nAs well.\n\n1090\n01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:09,080\nSo if we've got our checkpoints and\ndown in our details pane,\n\n1091\n01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:14,830\nwe do a little screen shot there and\nwhen it was created No, generations.\n\n1092\n01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:17,860\nAnd now we'll get into generations when\nwe create that much of machines but\n\n1093\n01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:23,980\nwe have generation one, we have generation\ntwo, which we get some new stuff.\n\n1094\n01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:28,150\nGeneration two we get secure boot,\nwith that, which is kinda fancy.\n\n1095\n01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:31,310\nClustered, right, so if we're gonna\ncluster these guys together for\n\n1096\n01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:32,660\nfailover, and everything.\n\n1097\n01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:38,030\nHeartbeat and integration services,\nwhich, we will get integration services.\n\n1098\n01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,190\nYeah a little bit later.\n\n1099\n01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:43,180\nYep, so we got some tabs down here\nwe can just click on some things.\n\n1100\n01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:46,880\nDynamic memory whether or\nnot the memory can fluctuate.\n\n1101\n01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,050\nIf the virtual machine is starting to run\ninto some tasks that it needs more memory\n\n1102\n01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,120\nit can take more.\n\n1103\n01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:57,580\nOr if it is sitting there idle\nit can release that memory for\n\n1104\n01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,000\nother machines to take it over and\n\n1105\n01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,106\ninto the networking so we do see that\nwhat is assigned a network adaptor,\n\n1106\n01:02:06,106 --> 01:02:11,150\non the ITProTV LAN and\nhere is its IP address.\n\n1107\n01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:13,880\nSo, Ronnie, a little knowledge check.\n\n1108\n01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,360\nWe've got two of these addresses.\n\n1109\n01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,850\nOne is familiar.\n\n1110\n01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:19,010\nThe other one is not.\n\n1111\n01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,850\nWhich one is this one?\n\n1112\n01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:24,779\nThe one beginning with\nFE80 is an IPv6 address.\n\n1113\n01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:26,630\nSweet.\n\n1114\n01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,460\nYeah.\nAll right, thank you Ronnie.\n\n1115\n01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,130\nAnd over here in the replication tab,\nright.\n\n1116\n01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:32,860\nWe don't have of this stuff, right.\n\n1117\n01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:36,320\nBut a bit more advanced\nthan what we're after.\n\n1118\n01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,320\nNow, one thing that we do have, so\nlet me just go back up here and\n\n1119\n01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,470\nclick on our domain controller.\n\n1120\n01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,265\nAnd let me float my mouse,\n\n1121\n01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:49,282\nwhich I was pretty sure that I could\nshrink that down, which it's not.\n\n1122\n01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:50,220\nThere you go.\n\n1123\n01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,638\nSo I could shrink that other one,\nI guess not.\n\n1124\n01:02:51,638 --> 01:02:52,850\nYeah not the one on bottom.\n\n1125\n01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:55,050\nSo here are some checkpoints.\n\n1126\n01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:59,520\nSo on this domain controller, we do make a\nlot of changes to this domain controller.\n\n1127\n01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,500\nSo we have the option to roll it back,\n\n1128\n01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:06,060\nwhich does introduce it's\nown problems with that.\n\n1129\n01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:09,780\nBut the way these checkpoints\nwork is that they're nested.\n\n1130\n01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:13,410\nSo we can have a checkpoint and\nhave that right there.\n\n1131\n01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:16,640\nThis one here was taken when\nit was first installed.\n\n1132\n01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,600\nSo we first installed it.\n\n1133\n01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,310\nWe took that checkpoint there.\n\n1134\n01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:24,207\nAnd as we turned it into a domain\ncontroller with the active directory,\n\n1135\n01:03:24,207 --> 01:03:26,830\nthen we can take that snapshot there.\n\n1136\n01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:29,650\nAnd another one,\nwhich who knows what that one made for.\n\n1137\n01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:33,070\nI think after it was,\nbefore it was all broken.\n\n1138\n01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:34,130\nAnd that one now based.\n\n1139\n01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:36,990\nSo whenever we revert anything,\n\n1140\n01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:40,060\nwe can go back to this checkpoint\nhere which is our base.\n\n1141\n01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:43,490\nSo everything is working for\nthe most part right there.\n\n1142\n01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,620\nSo we can delete checkpoints.\n\n1143\n01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,240\nWe can roll back the checkpoints.\n\n1144\n01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,060\nYeah.\n\n1145\n01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:52,950\nAnd let's say we could revert back\nto this checkpoint here and running.\n\n1146\n01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:57,680\nAnd if we wanted to create a checkpoint\nagain off of this configuration,\n\n1147\n01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,190\nthen it would continue the tree, and\n\n1148\n01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:04,220\nit would create another one down here,\nbypassing all this other stuff.\n\n1149\n01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,690\nSo, pretty fancy.\n\n1150\n01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,170\nPretty fancy stuff.\n\n1151\n01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:09,840\nYep.\n\n1152\n01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,510\nAnd we'll actually get into showing you\nhow all of that stuff really does work\n\n1153\n01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,120\nwhen we get into building\na virtual machine.\n\n1154\n01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,360\nAnd you'll see that there's more\ndetails there underneath what we'll see\n\n1155\n01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,980\non the actions as well.\n\n1156\n01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,820\nSo just because we show you\nthe overview of the Hyper-V manager and\n\n1157\n01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:27,200\nthe way that we can actually configure\na few things, we're by no means done yet.\n\n1158\n01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,060\nNext in our particular episode which\n\n1159\n01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:33,060\nwill be probably the next episode that\nwe'll do, we'll actually go ahead and\n\n1160\n01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,700\nbuild a virtual machine, and we'll\nbegin the configuration of it as well.\n\n1161\n01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,672\nSo we'll install and do everything.\n\n1162\n01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:43,810\nAll right Ronnie, that's sweet, so\nat that said we'll go ahead and\n\n1163\n01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,530\ncall it good right now.\n\n1164\n01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:49,980\nNow as always if you ever have any\nquestions during the show be sure to\n\n1165\n01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,520\njump in.\n\n1166\n01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,310\nRight beneath our live video, on the PC\nwe've got a little chat box down there,\n\n1167\n01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,270\nyou can type in a chat.\n\n1168\n01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,310\nWe've got a monitor up here,\nwe respond to it.\n\n1169\n01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:03,220\nIf you ever have any questions after the\nshow, you can jump into the Q&A section.\n\n1170\n01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:05,210\nJump into the forums in there,\ndrop us a line.\n\n1171\n01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:06,730\nWe monitor and get back to you.\n\n1172\n01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:10,330\nAnd if you're ever away from your PC,\nyou can always jump onto the Roku.\n\n1173\n01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:13,720\nWe've got a channel up there, you can\nsit in comfort of your own couch and\n\n1174\n01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,910\nwatch Ronnie up on your big screen TV or\nprojector.\n\n1175\n01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:17,440\nOh, dear.\n\n1176\n01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,060\nOr whatnot, so.\n\n1177\n01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,940\nAll right, well signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Nathan Copeland.\n\n1178\n01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:22,670\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n1179\n01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:24,550\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n1180\n01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:27,859\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
