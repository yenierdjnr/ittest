          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.952\n[SOUND] Hello, we're here to\nintroduce you to an exciting new\n\n2\n00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:08.435\nseries starting right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:14.270\nWhen we take a look at enabling\nOffice 365 Services for Exam 70-347.\n\n4\n00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.068\nNow if that's what you're interested in,\nyou're in the right place, as we take you\n\n5\n00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:21.760\nthrough every single exam objective\ndomain that we have available to us.\n\n6\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.570\nMake sure that you do get the details\nbehind that to get prepared for the exam.\n\n7\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.170\nLet's take a look at my screen as we take\na look at some of these different details.\n\n8\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.760\nWhen it comes down to it\nyou'll want to go here first.\n\n9\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.919\nI simply used the search engine and\ntyped in Exam 70-347 and\n\n10\n00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:39.420\nthat led me to Microsoft's\nofficial exam page.\n\n11\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.630\nFor this particular exam, and\nin US dollars it's $165.00 US dollars\n\n12\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.600\nthat you'll have to pay to be\nable to sit for this exam.\n\n13\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.800\nSo make sure you check out\nwhatever the details and\n\n14\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.770\nthe costs are in your region, and\nthat will also help you out too.\n\n15\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.360\nNow, this page is not only of course,\nabout having to pay for the exam and\n\n16\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.420\nregister for the exam and schedule,\nand everything that you need to do.\n\n17\n00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.390\nBut it's right here,\n\n18\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.710\nwhich is really the main point of what\nwe want to make sure that we understand.\n\n19\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.604\nMicrosoft does not officially\ncall them objective domains,\n\n20\n00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:13.050\nright, in terms of what you and\nI normally would see.\n\n21\n00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.280\nThey call them skills measured here.\n\n22\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.303\nAnd then the skill measured, this is where\nit becomes a little bit confusing because\n\n23\n00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:22.970\nthey have updated the exams skills.\n\n24\n00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.960\nNormally, you do end up seeing these\nfour different domain objectives\n\n25\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.010\nwhich will normally focus\nin on each one of these.\n\n26\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.330\nMake sure that we do hit\nevery single detail in those\n\n27\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.550\nas far as every domain\nobjective that they have.\n\n28\n00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.580\nBut this last paragraph right before,\nsays as of June 2016,\n\n29\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.280\nplease download the change document.\n\n30\n00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.045\nAnd that means that the details for\nthe exams have changed a little bit.\n\n31\n00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:50.987\nThey've taken some of\nthe older products out,\n\n32\n00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:54.250\nsome of the things that they really didn't\nwant to cover and also added them in.\n\n33\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.510\nAnd they allow you to\nsee what has changed.\n\n34\n00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.440\nI went ahead and downloaded this, and this\nis what the document ends up looking like.\n\n35\n00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.615\nSo internally, they call them ODs or\n\n36\n00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:06.493\nobjective domains for\nenabling the services and\n\n37\n00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:11.140\nthis is what will show you what skills\nare actually going to be tested on, too.\n\n38\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.412\nNow you do wanna make sure that you\nnot only cover these as well, but\n\n39\n00:02:14.412 --> 00:02:16.640\nmake sure you have a good\nworking knowledge.\n\n40\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.710\nSo it really does give you the benefit,\n\n41\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.360\nif you've already been\nworking with Office itself.\n\n42\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.100\nIf you already had a little bit of\nexperience with Office 365, and of course,\n\n43\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.690\nthe networking side of that,\nif you're connecting in.\n\n44\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.120\nSo make sure you check out the 70-346\nshow before you go in and sit for\n\n45\n00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.540\nthis exam, too.\n\n46\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.220\nTake a look at some of the experience\nthat's required there,\n\n47\n00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.860\nthat they assume that you'll have\nthe knowledge for in this exam as well.\n\n48\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.900\nWhen it comes down to it,\n\n49\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.700\nwe'll be taking a look at the same\ntypes of objective domains here.\n\n50\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.989\nWe'll take a look at managing\nthe user driven deployments,\n\n51\n00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.050\nas well as IT driven deployments\nof Office 365 and Office 2016.\n\n52\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.715\nWe'll also set up telemetry and reporting,\n\n53\n00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:02.518\nas well as talking about\nthe idea of planning for\n\n54\n00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:07.190\nusers to be able to get everything\nworking on their system as well.\n\n55\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.150\nWe'll also take a look of course,\nat provisioning SharePoint Online\n\n56\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.430\nsite collections to make them\nwork the way that we want to.\n\n57\n00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.210\nAnd it's here beginning with the red.\n\n58\n00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.524\nAnd some of the things that you see\ncrossed out and the red that's also\n\n59\n00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:24.360\nreplaced it, shows you the changes in the\ndomain objectives that have also happened.\n\n60\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.790\nAlong with this, there is a phrase that\nyou should pay attention to throughout\n\n61\n00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.210\nthe entirety of everything that you\nstudy here for this particular exam.\n\n62\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.790\nIt's gonna be a phrase that repeats\nover and over again where it says,\n\n63\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.260\nusing web UI and Windows PowerShell.\n\n64\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.690\nYou're not going to get away on this\nexam without knowing the PowerShell.\n\n65\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.420\nMake sure you take time, study it,\nmake sure you're using it daily.\n\n66\n00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.710\nThat will help you out as you\nalso get ready for this exam.\n\n67\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.010\nThey expect you to know\nboth not just one or\n\n68\n00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.610\nthe other,\nmake sure you pay attention there too.\n\n69\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.230\nWe'll also of course, take a look at\nconfiguring Skype Online as well as Skype\n\n70\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.420\nfor Business for the end user settings.\n\n71\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.230\nAnd you'll see that we'll\ngo through each and\n\n72\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.980\nevery one of these different objectives\nwithin each smaller domain that we have.\n\n73\n00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.820\nLastly, of course, planning for Exchange\nOnline and Skype for Business too.\n\n74\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.580\nWhere we will end up seeing of course,\nmultiple settings that we\n\n75\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.510\nneed to be able to make sure that we\nunderstand and be able to configure.\n\n76\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.755\nAll along this, this entire time,\n\n77\n00:04:30.755 --> 00:04:34.620\nwe will show you where you have\nto be able to go into the web UI,\n\n78\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.510\nas well as the PowerShell to get things\nconfigured to get ready for the exam.\n\n79\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.637\nNow, if this is what you're looking for\nin preparing for the Office 70-347 exam,\n\n80\n00:04:45.637 --> 00:04:50.310\nwell, you're in the right place\nas we begin our journey together.\n\n81\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.740\nAnd you'll take a look and you'll see\nthat there's plenty for us to do.\n\n82\n00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.833\nSo if you're ready for that,\nmake sure you stay tuned for\n\n83\n00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.709\nthe next episode coming right up.\n\n84\n00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:02.299\n[SOUND]\n\n",

host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.340\nIn this episode, we'll be looking at how\nto manage your clients' deployments.\n\n7\n00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.900\nAnd with us today, in studios,\nwe have Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.200\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.190\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back,\nas we take a look here at Office 365, and\n\n10\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.560\nespecially about,\nof course, managing, well,\n\n11\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.480\nreally, Office, right, Microsoft Office.\n\n12\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.260\n2016 was installed on our computer,\nbut really Office 365 itself.\n\n13\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.590\nSince we're really talking\nabout Office 365 services,\n\n14\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.000\none of the key aspects of this, of course,\nif you're an Office 365 administrator,\n\n15\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.830\nis to make sure that every user that needs\nit is gonna be able to have Office 365, or\n\n16\n00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.610\nI should say Office 2016,\ninstalled on their individual computers.\n\n17\n00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.116\nAnd at some point in the past,\nhave you been a traditional network\n\n18\n00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:06.450\nadministrator or systems administrator,\nlike I have been.\n\n19\n00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.146\nThe idea of deployments and software\ndeployments tended to take a lot of\n\n20\n00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:12.733\ntime and\na whole bunch of other configurations and\n\n21\n00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.820\nconsiderations that we\nneeded to actually take.\n\n22\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.790\nSo, this is something that as we get\nstarted in Office 365 and saying, hey,\n\n23\n00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.840\nwe wanna make sure that everybody\nhas access to Office at least.\n\n24\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.080\nThat we need to consider the management of\nit and the way that it's normally done.\n\n25\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.940\nAnd so that's what we're actually gonna be\ntaking a look at it in this episode too.\n\n26\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great,\n\n27\n00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.380\nnow Ronnie, I've worked as a network\nadministrator in the past as well.\n\n28\n00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.530\nAnd a lot of the times,\nI almost seem kind of a control freak.\n\n29\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.150\nBecause you really wanna make sure\nthat everything within your realm of\n\n30\n00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.190\nresponsibility is well taken care of.\n\n31\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.991\nSo when we look at solutions, such as the\ntopics we're gonna be covering here, and\n\n32\n00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:50.230\nwe see untraditional methods\nof software deployment.\n\n33\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.700\nShould this be a cause for\n\n34\n00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.040\nconcern when it comes to us giving\nup too much of that control?\n\n35\n00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the key, right,\n\n36\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.750\nis that now that the world has kinda\nmoved into more of a hybrid approach,\n\n37\n00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.990\ninstead of just everything being\nmanaged within a single network.\n\n38\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.780\nWhere we have a centralized\ndeployment share and\n\n39\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.080\neven centralized deployment management.\n\n40\n00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.890\nWith Office 365, we now have to consider\nthe idea of cloud deployment too.\n\n41\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.530\nAnd the way that this ends up working in\nOffice 365 is what ends up happening is\n\n42\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.912\nthat every user now that has\na subscription into your organization's\n\n43\n00:02:23.912 --> 00:02:29.550\nOffice 365 normally, also, of course, gets\naccess to Office itself, which is fine.\n\n44\n00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.960\nExcept that when it comes up\non their first initial login,\n\n45\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.910\nit's fairly easy on how they deploy that,\nwhich is just simply clicking on a button.\n\n46\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.160\nAnd what Cherokee's mentioning to us and\ntelling us is, hey, we're no longer in\n\n47\n00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.560\ncontrol of that, and are we giving\nup too much control if we do that?\n\n48\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.332\nBecause in the past,\nthe reason behind this, right,\n\n49\n00:02:51.332 --> 00:02:55.069\nis because with our organization,\nif we bought Office, you had to pay for\n\n50\n00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.080\na certain number of licenses, right?\n\n51\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.128\nAnd so when we pay for\nthis certain number of licenses,\n\n52\n00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:02.796\nit means that we don't\ntend to just give it out.\n\n53\n00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:05.700\nJust willy nilly-\n&gt;&gt; Haphazardly.\n\n54\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we just kind of say,\n\n55\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.100\nall right, we're gonna deploy it either\nin an image or whatever it might be.\n\n56\n00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.120\nBut we end up handling it,\nwe end up controlling it.\n\n57\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.436\nAnd we end up testing it, you name it,\nthere's so many different things.\n\n58\n00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:18.898\nBut Office 365, and\n\n59\n00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:24.020\ntheir deployment methodology really kind\nof stems in two different directions.\n\n60\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.504\nEither we can go user-based types of\ndeployment or user-driven deployments, or\n\n61\n00:03:28.504 --> 00:03:31.060\nwe can go to IT managed deployments.\n\n62\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.400\nAnd the default setup,\nof course, is user-driven.\n\n63\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.484\nSo when we start to take a look\nthen as an Office 365 admin,\n\n64\n00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:41.220\nare we giving up control when we do that?\n\n65\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.225\nWell, let's think about some of the things\nthat we're really giving up, Cherokee,\n\n66\n00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:45.800\nwhen we start thinking about this idea.\n\n67\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.520\nSo let's take for an example that\nwhat we've had a lot of times,\n\n68\n00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.770\nof course, is just a limited\nnumber of activations, right?\n\n69\n00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.360\nAnd in that limited number of activations,\nthings could go wrong very quickly.\n\n70\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.790\nEven during testing,\nif we accidentally set a switch wrong,\n\n71\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.120\nwe could activate all of\nthese different copies.\n\n72\n00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.170\nAnd then when it came time to actually\ndeploy the software out there,\n\n73\n00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.410\nwe actually didn't have\nenough activations.\n\n74\n00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.355\n&gt;&gt; We've already chewed\nthrough all of those keys.\n\n75\n00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:13.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you actually ended up having that.\n\n76\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.270\nOr the other aspect that ends up happening\nis, let's say that we go ahead and\n\n77\n00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.700\nwe buy a volume license for so\nmany different users that we have.\n\n78\n00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.079\nBut it also comes up then that a user,\nthey say, look,\n\n79\n00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:29.280\nI'm not only needed on my desktop\ncomputer right here where I work.\n\n80\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.638\nBut I now need it on the laptop,\nso that as I travel,\n\n81\n00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:34.916\nI need to have that same software.\n\n82\n00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:38.735\nWell, all of a sudden, you might not\nhave accounted for enough licenses just\n\n83\n00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:42.760\nwhen you think that you did, because you\nprovided at least to one for every user.\n\n84\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.670\nSo now, not only does that happen, but now\nyou're actually putting on two different\n\n85\n00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.660\nmachines, and soon,\nyou're gonna run out of licenses again.\n\n86\n00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.600\nThe other thing that ends up running\nout of licenses is fairly simple.\n\n87\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.130\nLet's take for an example here that what\nCherokee does is that she says well,\n\n88\n00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.210\nit'd not only be nice for\nme to have it at the office here and\n\n89\n00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.350\non a laptop when I'm\nactually out travelling.\n\n90\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.040\nBut I know that if I had it on my home\ncomputer, okay, then I would get so\n\n91\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.660\nmuch more work done.\n\n92\n00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.910\n&gt;&gt; Because that's what\nI wanna do everyday.\n\n93\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.610\n&gt;&gt; Of course, yeah, but I mean,\nthings like this happen where-\n\n94\n00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.158\n&gt;&gt; Sure, well,\n\n95\n00:05:15.158 --> 00:05:16.670\neven with our mobile devices, right?\n\n96\n00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.040\nWe're able to install it\non our mobile devices and\n\n97\n00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.080\nessentially become an around-the-clock,\nan employee.\n\n98\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so when something like that\nends up happening where now you thought,\n\n99\n00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.070\nwell, maybe, two per user, and\nall of a sudden, you're realizing three.\n\n100\n00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.710\nBecause if Cherokee asked,\nsomebody else is gonna ask us.\n\n101\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.680\nCherokee's gonna say,\nyeah, the IT department-\n\n102\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.192\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie let me have five installs, yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:39.206\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why not?\n\n104\n00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:39.734\nWhy not?\n\n105\n00:05:39.734 --> 00:05:41.430\nLet's just keep handing it out.\n\n106\n00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.440\nAnd so what ended up happening then is,\nof course, that would continue to go on.\n\n107\n00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.617\nSo when you start thinking about\nwhat you're giving up here,\n\n108\n00:05:48.617 --> 00:05:52.910\nwell, a lot of that actually does kind of\nget a little bit more concerning, right?\n\n109\n00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.840\nBut it all comes down to licensing and\nmanaging the licensings that we also have.\n\n110\n00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.770\nThe key also, of course, is,\nif we have it just as part of, for\n\n111\n00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.760\nexample, the image that we talked about,\nright?\n\n112\n00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.820\nThe very fact is, I work for\nan organization in which we image\n\n113\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.840\nthe computers probably once a quarter, if\nnot even more often than that, depending\n\n114\n00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.970\non how much usage that we have, especially\nin that training facility, right?\n\n115\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.870\nWell, when you start doing that and now\nthe activations are just being depleted by\n\n116\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.720\none classroom, it becomes a little\nbit more and more challenging.\n\n117\n00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.640\nIt's not that you can't go and\nget those things turned around.\n\n118\n00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.565\nBut a lot of times,\nif you actually ended up getting so\n\n119\n00:06:30.565 --> 00:06:35.180\nmany activations automatically, then you\nhad to manually start activating them.\n\n120\n00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.600\nAnd that meant time on the phone,\nlistening to an automated message, and\n\n121\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.098\nthen having to go around\nevery computer to activate.\n\n122\n00:06:41.098 --> 00:06:45.753\nSo these automated type of things\ncan really run licenses very\n\n123\n00:06:45.753 --> 00:06:48.100\nquickly out than we realized.\n\n124\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.250\nAnd lastly, of course, is that if we\nsaid all right, here you go, Cherokee.\n\n125\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.750\nInstall this on your home computer.\n\n126\n00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.670\nHere's the key for you.\n\n127\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.025\nJust make sure that you don't\ngive this out to anybody else.\n\n128\n00:06:58.025 --> 00:07:02.429\nInevitably, you go back to Cherokee\na month later and go, Cherokee,\n\n129\n00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:04.980\nwhere's the copy of the Office 365?\n\n130\n00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.630\nAnd Cherokee goes,\nsomewhere at home, maybe.\n\n131\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.660\n&gt;&gt; Probably where my cell phone is.\n\n132\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.332\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n133\n00:07:11.332 --> 00:07:13.318\n&gt;&gt; That thing is always getting lost.\n\n134\n00:07:13.318 --> 00:07:16.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing about how quickly the idea\n\n135\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.400\nhere of even though you think\nthat you're in control, right?\n\n136\n00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.680\nBecause you're the one that\ninitially had all these licenses.\n\n137\n00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.230\nYou're the one that had a copy\nof the software deployment,\n\n138\n00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.520\nthe files that you needed for\ninstallation.\n\n139\n00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.290\nEven though all of that\nhas taken place and\n\n140\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.200\nyou should be managing it,\nyou kinda found out something.\n\n141\n00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.780\nThat there are so many more difficulties\nin terms of managing the software itself.\n\n142\n00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.050\nThat it is more challenging,\nright, than what you think.\n\n143\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.845\nSo the traditional methods of management\nthemselves have normally not been super\n\n144\n00:07:49.845 --> 00:07:52.357\neffective is what it comes down to, okay?\n\n145\n00:07:52.357 --> 00:07:56.839\nSo when Office 365, when it came out and\nthey said, all right,\n\n146\n00:07:56.839 --> 00:08:01.083\nhere's what we're gonna do with\nthe Office management Well,\n\n147\n00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:04.463\nof course, you might think,\nwell, it's easy.\n\n148\n00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:06.940\nA single user that gets\na single subscription.\n\n149\n00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.850\nSo just like Cherokee,\n\n150\n00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.890\nshe's part of my organization,\nshe gets a single subscription.\n\n151\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.400\nWe would go and\n\n152\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.450\njust say, all right, Cherokee, you're\ngonna be able to install this one time.\n\n153\n00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.920\nWell, now you kind of have to\nleave it up to the end user.\n\n154\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.960\nWell, one time,\nhow is Cherokee gonna actually do that?\n\n155\n00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.510\nDoes she actually make a decision that\nshe's only gonna install it on her\n\n156\n00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.700\nwork computer?\n\n157\n00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.940\nOr is she gonna choose to\ninstall it on her home computer?\n\n158\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.630\nIs she gonna choose to install\nit on the mobile computer?\n\n159\n00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.240\nAnd then once she actually puts it\non one of them, then she goes, but\n\n160\n00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.710\nwhat about my home computer now?\n\n161\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.300\nWell now, this is where it becomes\nmore challenging too, right.\n\n162\n00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.800\nSo, it seems like that\nthere is a bit of a hassle.\n\n163\n00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.990\nBut it really isn't much of a hassle\nwhen you actually understand that\n\n164\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.620\nidea of a subscription\nbase from Office 365.\n\n165\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.090\nThe very fact and\n\n166\n00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:59.260\nthe user driven deployment kind of evens\nout these numbers a little bit for us.\n\n167\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.230\nBecause by default, when a user gets\none of those subscriptions that allows\n\n168\n00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.770\nthem to install Office on them,\nand there are different plans,\n\n169\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.890\neither they'll actually allow you to\ninstall it onto your computers, or\n\n170\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.320\nthey go, no,\nyou're just gonna use the online version.\n\n171\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.390\nBut if they get one of those plans\nwhere they're allowed to install it on\n\n172\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:23.360\nthe computers, every subscriber normally\ngets five chances to actually install it\n\n173\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.700\non to that computer, not onto that\ncomputer but five licenses essentially.\n\n174\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.530\nAnd then they can actually\ninstall it on those five.\n\n175\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.910\nAnd that's pretty much the limitation\nthat we end up having.\n\n176\n00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.030\nWell, let's go ahead and take a look at\nwhere we see that and then we'll kind of\n\n177\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.320\ntalk about some of the other features\nthat we need to as well along the way.\n\n178\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.040\nSo, here I am on my computer and\n\n179\n00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.370\nI'm logged in as the user\nthat I'm gonna be using.\n\n180\n00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.350\nAnd this guy is Joey here.\n\n181\n00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.650\nSo, once I'm actually\nonto that computer and\n\n182\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.350\nthis is a domain joined computer,\nLet's say that this is the first time,\n\n183\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.480\nwe know that we now have\nan office 365 subscription.\n\n184\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.610\nI just tell him exactly where to go and\nlogin,\n\n185\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.280\nand that's gonna be portal.office.com.\n\n186\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.880\nAnd if he's logged in before,\nhis name may show up and\n\n187\n00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.320\nsometimes he may actually log right in.\n\n188\n00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.510\nBut if his name doesn't show up, he'll\nsimply type in his email address, and\n\n189\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.790\nthen he'll also type in his password.\n\n190\n00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.820\n&gt;&gt; And this is the default look,\n\n191\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.550\nfeel different organizations\nmight be slightly different?\n\n192\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.490\n&gt;&gt; That's correct, yep.\n\n193\n00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.660\nYou can go ahead as an Office admin.\n\n194\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.350\nYou can actually personalize\nthis to where it changes,\n\n195\n00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.470\nand it even has your company\nlogo up here if you choose to.\n\n196\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.100\nBut for this one,\n\n197\n00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.890\nthis is kinda just really the kind\nof vanilla install at this point.\n\n198\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.590\nSo, here, add Joey and\nI now need to type in his password.\n\n199\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:44.439\nI always think I type it in correctly,\nbut I may not.\n\n200\n00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:46.370\n&gt;&gt; I think you need a few more\ncharacters there, Ronnie.\n\n201\n00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.195\n&gt;&gt; I think I do.\n\n202\n00:10:47.195 --> 00:10:49.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n203\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.490\nonce we login, this is what\nthe normal regular user may see.\n\n204\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.730\nNow depending on the licenses,\n\n205\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.320\nhe may not have as many towels\nas this guy has, right?\n\n206\n00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.730\nI know that Joey here,\n\n207\n00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.840\nactually has what's called an E5 license,\nwhich gives him access to everything.\n\n208\n00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.450\nIt is the highest licensing that we\ngenerally do end up seeing here.\n\n209\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.420\nSo, you might end up finding out\nthat you actually do have one that's\n\n210\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.340\nless than that.\n\n211\n00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.000\nSo, let me show you\nan example of that too.\n\n212\n00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.020\nSo this one, let me do this again.\n\n213\n00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.010\nLet's see if it actually\nlogs me directly in.\n\n214\n00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.710\nIt may log me directly in here.\n\n215\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.030\nYup, so this one's actually\nlogging me directly in.\n\n216\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.500\nLet's see if I can do\nthat private Window here.\n\n217\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.570\nAnd now in this private Window,\nwe'll try it again.\n\n218\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.960\nAnd this will kind of lead me here.\n\n219\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:45.575\nThis is gonna be jt@officeprodemoco.on\n\n220\n00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:50.740\nMicrosoft.com, and\n\n221\n00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.800\nthen once again a very long password,\nat least for me.\n\n222\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.857\nAnd hopefully I've typed it in here,\nCorrectly.\n\n223\n00:12:01.857 --> 00:12:05.650\n[LAUGH] That's my, All right.\n\n224\n00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.420\nSo try it one more time, yep.\n\n225\n00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.220\n&gt;&gt; When you are typing\nin that domain name,\n\n226\n00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.050\nI noticed that that red\nmessage did appear.\n\n227\n00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.550\nIs that something we need to check?\n\n228\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, you do,\nbecause what it's saying is hey,\n\n229\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.160\nI don't really recognize this, right?\n\n230\n00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.620\nAnd the problem is,\nI actually mistyped it here.\n\n231\n00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:25.040\nSo, it should be\nofficeprodemocoonMicrosoft.com.\n\n232\n00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.310\nHopefully this time, there it goes.\n\n233\n00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.230\nNotice it says, a work or school account.\n\n234\n00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:34.028\nSo it did catch me, and\nmy typing ability is really not great.\n\n235\n00:12:34.028 --> 00:12:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can even see what you're\ntyping, so that's why I had to ask.\n\n236\n00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.200\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.449\n&gt;&gt; So now, we'll actually login\n\n238\n00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:41.550\nhere, okay.\n\n239\n00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:46.460\nNow, this particular user account\ndoes not have as many privileges, so\n\n240\n00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.140\nwhen we start to take a look\nhere notice by comparison.\n\n241\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.260\n&gt;&gt; Much more limited.\n\n242\n00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah she see where this\nguy has a lot, which is Joey and\n\n243\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.716\nthis guy here Justin Timberlake of course,\n&gt;&gt; Woo.\n\n244\n00:12:57.716 --> 00:13:00.325\n&gt;&gt; And if you think that I've\nmade this account, I did not.\n\n245\n00:13:00.325 --> 00:13:02.634\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this is the one that we ended up-\n\n246\n00:13:02.634 --> 00:13:03.449\n&gt;&gt; Sure, Ronnie.\n\n247\n00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.097\n&gt;&gt; Getting assign to.\n\n248\n00:13:04.097 --> 00:13:07.440\nYes.\nI don't even know exactly everything here.\n\n249\n00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.640\nBut here you go.\n\n250\n00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.033\nYou did notice that\nJustin Timberlake's account-\n\n251\n00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:10.755\n&gt;&gt; A lot less tiles.\n\n252\n00:13:10.755 --> 00:13:11.862\n&gt;&gt; Has much more limited.\n\n253\n00:13:11.862 --> 00:13:13.866\nLess tiles that are actually available.\n\n254\n00:13:13.866 --> 00:13:15.300\n&gt;&gt; For futures.\n\n255\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.760\n&gt;&gt; But you can see right away that,\n\n256\n00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.970\nreally the instances are fairly\nthe same in terms of installing.\n\n257\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.720\nSo the great thing is, it means something\nas far as user driven the premise of\n\n258\n00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.210\noffice and so,\nonto the computer as far as office here.\n\n259\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.260\nThat means most of the time,\nif somebody will login to a website,\n\n260\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:37.670\nthey are fairly easy and you can see\nwhere it says, install office right away.\n\n261\n00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.380\nSo, when you actually install that.\n\n262\n00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.570\nWell it's not like you have\nto tell them where to go.\n\n263\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.900\nYou don't even have to\ncreate a centralized share.\n\n264\n00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.280\nYou don't have to actually say that\nit's gotta be joined to the domain.\n\n265\n00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.590\nIt really doesn't.\n\n266\n00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.910\nThey are now connected in to Office 365,\nthe cloud environment.\n\n267\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.500\nWhether they're inside of the domain.\n\n268\n00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.770\nWhether they're out on\nthe internet somewhere.\n\n269\n00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.990\nThey simply can click on\nthat particular link and\n\n270\n00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.530\nget Office installed on to\ntheir particular computer.\n\n271\n00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.801\nAnd that is really kind of key\nbecause now instead of Cherokee,\n\n272\n00:14:09.801 --> 00:14:15.121\nif she's part of my administration team\nand managing software deployments,\n\n273\n00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:20.119\nCherokee doesn't have to go around\nactually figuring out how many copies\n\n274\n00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:24.409\nof office is actually left out\nthere as we add in more machines.\n\n275\n00:14:24.409 --> 00:14:28.488\nShe really doesn't because it's now all\nmanaged through the cloud itself and\n\n276\n00:14:28.488 --> 00:14:32.814\nshe can get account of all the people in\nthe organization who's actually installed\n\n277\n00:14:32.814 --> 00:14:34.815\nit very easily and very quickly here.\n\n278\n00:14:34.815 --> 00:14:37.079\nBut without her having to actually go,\n\n279\n00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:41.273\nwho did we send out there to make sure\nthat this was installed correctly?\n\n280\n00:14:41.273 --> 00:14:44.360\nOr who did we actually make\nsure that this happened?\n\n281\n00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.750\nBut this is the way it goes, right.\n\n282\n00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.980\nSo this user driven\ndeployment fairly easy.\n\n283\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.470\nThe software we no longer have to manage,\nand\n\n284\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.210\nthere's a lot of other things\nthat we can talk about too.\n\n285\n00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:59.210\n&gt;&gt; Side effects may also be, Ronnie,\nsometimes in certain organizations.\n\n286\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:04.550\nI know we're not supposed to, but\nI've seen where certain admins didn't\n\n287\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.870\nfeel like going out and\ninstalling that software.\n\n288\n00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.600\nSo, they just gave administrative\nprivileges to what should have been normal\n\n289\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.250\nprivileged end users, standard users.\n\n290\n00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.950\nSo, we're kind of preventing\n\n291\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:22.040\nthat laziness from happening here\nby delegating in a safe way.\n\n292\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.870\n&gt;&gt; To a point, you're absolutely right.\n\n293\n00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:29.100\nThe very fact is instead, there's\na limitation on what they can do, right?\n\n294\n00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.030\nWhatever their particular subscription\naccount is, that's pretty much the limit.\n\n295\n00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.080\nAnd there is no way\nthey're getting around it.\n\n296\n00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.590\nThey're not appealing to me,\nthey're not gonna do that.\n\n297\n00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.910\nAnd the reason why it's\nnot gonna appeal to me,\n\n298\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:44.660\nif Cherokee says, Ronnie you gave me\nfive licences but I need seven of them.\n\n299\n00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.890\nWell, that doesn't actually\never come from me,\n\n300\n00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.360\nwhat that means is that\nCherokee needs seven of them.\n\n301\n00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.858\nI need to buy another account for her.\n\n302\n00:15:50.858 --> 00:15:54.271\nI can't just go and say,\nokay, here's an extra two.\n\n303\n00:15:54.271 --> 00:15:59.014\nSo now, it becomes a monetary decision for\nthe actual organization.\n\n304\n00:15:59.014 --> 00:16:01.431\nIn which you're gonna say,\nlook, you're not gonna do it.\n\n305\n00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:04.189\nAnd it doesn't matter how\nmuch Cherokee screams at it,\n\n306\n00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:08.078\nif her account is limited in that way,\nthat's what her account is limited to.\n\n307\n00:16:08.078 --> 00:16:12.002\nSo the idea of the user driven side and\nthe managing deployments here.\n\n308\n00:16:12.002 --> 00:16:16.231\nIt really becomes less of a headache for\nthe IT manager at this point.\n\n309\n00:16:16.231 --> 00:16:20.860\nSo that the users can actually do kind\nof the basic things that we expect\n\n310\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.357\nusers to be able to do.\n\n311\n00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:26.620\nAnd that is, they should be able to\ninstall the software on the computers.\n\n312\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.270\nThey shouldn't have to worry about\nthe licensing or the activation.\n\n313\n00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.580\nThey should never have to come to me and\ngo,\n\n314\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.830\nhey, I don't think that I can use Office.\n\n315\n00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.950\nIt should actually happen automatically,\n\n316\n00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.000\nwithout us really ever\nneeding to get involved.\n\n317\n00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.100\nBut at the same time,\nwe should also have the ability then,\n\n318\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.460\nas IT administrators,\nto control aspects of this too.\n\n319\n00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.520\nSo the way that we end up doing that,\nthough,\n\n320\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.500\nis that we have to actually go a little\nbit further into Office to help us out.\n\n321\n00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.080\nBecause let's say that what's\nanother issue that has to do with\n\n322\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.830\nOffice installations, is simple.\n\n323\n00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.712\nNow, Cherokee, have you ever had it where\none person uses every product in Office,\n\n324\n00:17:05.712 --> 00:17:06.650\no kay?\n\n325\n00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.690\nBut there is another person that says, to\ntell you the truth I might use Excel and\n\n326\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.090\nI might use Word every once in a while.\n\n327\n00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:13.890\nHave you ever had that?\n\n328\n00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much, sometimes people\njust use Outlook to check their email and\n\n329\n00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.650\nthey're not heavy users.\n\n330\n00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:20.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there it is.\n\n331\n00:17:20.895 --> 00:17:25.655\nNow all of a sudden you have this entire\nOffice Suite that has everything involved\n\n332\n00:17:25.655 --> 00:17:28.667\nin it,\nwhich is fairly large productivity suite.\n\n333\n00:17:28.667 --> 00:17:30.230\nAnd when it comes down to it,\n\n334\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:34.110\nthey're using two products out of\nthe entire suite of products here.\n\n335\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.940\n&gt;&gt; Wasting their hardware resources.\n\n336\n00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.360\n&gt;&gt; Wasting the resources but\n\n337\n00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.550\nat the same time it's kind of\na waste of everything, right?\n\n338\n00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.260\nSo there's a whole license that's\nactually involved in that way.\n\n339\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.220\nBut yes, they don't actually need\nto have that product on there.\n\n340\n00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.000\nSo by leaving it on there,\nwe're not only wasting resources.\n\n341\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.440\nWe're actually even\ngiving an opportunity for\n\n342\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.200\nother things to happen to that computer\nif we don't want them to happen to.\n\n343\n00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.713\nRemember that anytime software\nis on there [CROSSTALK].\n\n344\n00:17:58.713 --> 00:17:59.556\n&gt;&gt; Extra coding.\n\n345\n00:17:59.556 --> 00:18:00.415\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n346\n00:18:00.415 --> 00:18:04.288\n&gt;&gt; It's just adding in more and more\nattacks surfaces for even other people.\n\n347\n00:18:04.288 --> 00:18:07.322\nSo we really don't want something\nlike that to go on as well.\n\n348\n00:18:07.322 --> 00:18:10.998\nSo the great thing is there are controls\nthat are in place that can help us out.\n\n349\n00:18:10.998 --> 00:18:12.209\nNow, let's go ahead down and\n\n350\n00:18:12.209 --> 00:18:14.982\ntake a look down at some of these\ncontrols that we wanna make sure of.\n\n351\n00:18:14.982 --> 00:18:19.248\nThat even though the end user seems like\nthat they now have ultimate control.\n\n352\n00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:23.097\nAnd can install Office every way that\nthey want to be able to install it.\n\n353\n00:18:23.097 --> 00:18:27.000\nThere are gonna be those limitations and\nthat's what we wanna take a look at now.\n\n354\n00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.615\nSo I'm gonna close out of the Justin\nTimberlake account there for a moment.\n\n355\n00:18:31.615 --> 00:18:32.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n356\n00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:37.311\nthen I'm gonna use Joey\n[CROSSTALK] here to help us out.\n\n357\n00:18:37.311 --> 00:18:41.721\nAnd the reason why I'm using Joey is\nbecause he is actually an Office 365\n\n358\n00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:43.544\nadministrator at this point.\n\n359\n00:18:43.544 --> 00:18:45.347\nSo he gets access to things\nthat Joey may not be able to.\n\n360\n00:18:45.347 --> 00:18:48.211\n&gt;&gt; But he looks just like a llama to me.\n\n361\n00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.007\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think that that one,\n\n362\n00:18:50.007 --> 00:18:52.639\nthat is actually customised by Yvonne.\n\n363\n00:18:52.639 --> 00:18:56.091\nIt's actually a joey,\nan actual kangaroo there.\n\n364\n00:18:56.091 --> 00:18:56.854\n&gt;&gt; How clever.\n\n365\n00:18:56.854 --> 00:19:01.905\n&gt;&gt; A little kangaroo, a joey,\nthat's right So somebody that really\n\n366\n00:19:01.905 --> 00:19:07.600\nloves this group took the time to actually\nbe able to do this so there you go.\n\n367\n00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.600\nIf you think that I took\nthe time to do that, I did not.\n\n368\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.710\nI did actually add in a little\nbit of customization here.\n\n369\n00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.270\n&gt;&gt; I saw that.\n\n370\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.970\n&gt;&gt; And you can see that.\n\n371\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.900\nYeah, there you go.\n\n372\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.680\nBut overall, though,\nthis is what we want to do.\n\n373\n00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.650\nSo let's say that we\nare the office administrator.\n\n374\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.673\nAnd now we realize something, okay?\n\n375\n00:19:23.673 --> 00:19:27.956\nWith the install of Office 365,\nI'm gonna click right over here,\n\n376\n00:19:27.956 --> 00:19:30.584\nunderneath where is says Install Office.\n\n377\n00:19:30.584 --> 00:19:34.011\nIt says Other installs and\nselect this option instead.\n\n378\n00:19:34.011 --> 00:19:37.305\nJust so that we can take a look at what\nthe end user would normally end up seeing\n\n379\n00:19:37.305 --> 00:19:38.370\nit, okay?\n\n380\n00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.917\nWith the own user driven\ntypes of deployment,\n\n381\n00:19:40.917 --> 00:19:42.952\nyou have a couple of things going on.\n\n382\n00:19:42.952 --> 00:19:47.504\nFirst and\nforemost here you start to see, here,\n\n383\n00:19:47.504 --> 00:19:54.183\nInstall Office 365 ProPlus with\nthe new 2016 apps here, okay?\n\n384\n00:19:54.183 --> 00:19:59.673\nAnd you actually see now if you've\nalready been working in Office 365 for\n\n385\n00:19:59.673 --> 00:20:04.991\nyears before Office 2016 came out,\nyou even see this question here,\n\n386\n00:20:04.991 --> 00:20:08.447\nthis link, what happened to Office 2013?\n\n387\n00:20:08.447 --> 00:20:11.393\nWell it used to be where,\nif you installed Office,\n\n388\n00:20:11.393 --> 00:20:15.583\nthey would give you the ability\nto install either 2013 or 2016.\n\n389\n00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:21.678\nBut as of February 28th of this year,\nokay, of the filming,\n\n390\n00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:28.006\nwhich is 2017,\nthey've quit supporting Office 2013.\n\n391\n00:20:28.006 --> 00:20:31.940\nSo now they're saying look,\nwe're not gonna support that any longer.\n\n392\n00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.160\nSo can you still get it?\n\n393\n00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.540\nYes, but not through Office 365.\n\n394\n00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.418\nThey're done in their support of\nthat particular product anymore.\n\n395\n00:20:39.418 --> 00:20:41.333\nBut now you can see with this E5 license,\n\n396\n00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:43.917\nlook at all of these things\nthat I have available for me.\n\n397\n00:20:43.917 --> 00:20:47.452\nWord, Excel, PowerPoint,\nOneNote, Access, Publisher,\n\n398\n00:20:47.452 --> 00:20:51.800\nOutlook and the issue that we were talking\nabout in just the last few minutes.\n\n399\n00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.763\nIs what if I do end up having a user that\nreally doesn't need all of these things on\n\n400\n00:20:56.763 --> 00:20:57.962\ntheir computers?\n\n401\n00:20:57.962 --> 00:21:01.918\nWell, there are some limitation and\nthere are ways that we can control that.\n\n402\n00:21:01.918 --> 00:21:04.631\nWe'll see that more in the IT\nmanaged types of deployment.\n\n403\n00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:07.833\nBut there is a big one that\nwe can set right now for\n\n404\n00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:10.328\nall of our users to help limit us too.\n\n405\n00:21:10.328 --> 00:21:13.658\nNow the other thing that\nwe also end up seeing here.\n\n406\n00:21:13.658 --> 00:21:18.183\nIs we, of course, have the ability\nto choose whether we are using\n\n407\n00:21:18.183 --> 00:21:22.980\nthe 32-bit edition or\neven the 64-bit edition as well.\n\n408\n00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.580\nNow, by default if you click\non this Advanced button here,\n\n409\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.533\nthen you can choose which\nversion that you want.\n\n410\n00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:33.161\nNow, the recommendation is 32-bit, okay?\n\n411\n00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:35.830\nEven if you're running\na 64-bit operating system.\n\n412\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.700\nSaying there's no real benefit\nto running the 64-bit.\n\n413\n00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.588\nAnd that way if you read this here you\ncan go ahead and read more on that.\n\n414\n00:21:42.588 --> 00:21:45.622\nAnd you'll see that they say, hey,\nif you're gonna install it just for\n\n415\n00:21:45.622 --> 00:21:47.275\neverybody, just use the the 32 bit.\n\n416\n00:21:47.275 --> 00:21:52.174\nIt really doesn't give everybody\nwhat they need as well.\n\n417\n00:21:52.174 --> 00:21:55.117\nAnd of course, whatever language\npack that you want installed there,\n\n418\n00:21:55.117 --> 00:21:56.943\nI'm gonna choose English because of this.\n\n419\n00:21:56.943 --> 00:21:57.528\n&gt;&gt; Good idea.\n\n420\n00:21:57.528 --> 00:22:00.172\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not actually going\nto install it right now but\n\n421\n00:22:00.172 --> 00:22:01.944\nwe'll see this a little bit later.\n\n422\n00:22:01.944 --> 00:22:03.065\nBut it's fairly simple.\n\n423\n00:22:03.065 --> 00:22:04.498\nOnce you actually have all that,\n\n424\n00:22:04.498 --> 00:22:06.757\nthat's pretty much what\nthe end user has to choose.\n\n425\n00:22:06.757 --> 00:22:09.237\nAnd then he simply clicks on Install and\n\n426\n00:22:09.237 --> 00:22:12.555\nfrom there the Office\ninstall will begin to happen.\n\n427\n00:22:12.555 --> 00:22:14.831\nAnd that way it will begin downloading and\n\n428\n00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:17.764\nfrom that point they just\nhave to follow directions.\n\n429\n00:22:17.764 --> 00:22:23.580\nAnd in not too long of a time, Office 365\nwill get installed on their computers.\n\n430\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.550\n&gt;&gt; And I can omit any kind of\nutilities that I really don't need.\n\n431\n00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah at a point, at this stage, right?\n\n432\n00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.799\nIf we haven't configured anything,\nwe really can.\n\n433\n00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:35.839\nBut we can in other things once we\nget into the IT managed deployment,\n\n434\n00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:38.640\nwe can control this much better, okay?\n\n435\n00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.966\nSo if we want to get to that control, yes.\n\n436\n00:22:40.966 --> 00:22:45.460\nOkay, but let's just say right here at\nthe beginning as we start seeing this\n\n437\n00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.650\nlook at what we've done here.\n\n438\n00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.265\nWe've essentially empowered\nour end users right.\n\n439\n00:22:49.265 --> 00:22:52.308\nTo be able to take Office\n365 they can manage it.\n\n440\n00:22:52.308 --> 00:22:53.960\nThey can choose which version.\n\n441\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.613\nIf they're not sure\nthey can do the readme.\n\n442\n00:22:55.613 --> 00:22:59.350\nOr we can just tell them,\nleave it alone, use the default.\n\n443\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.820\nAnd here is the language right here, okay?\n\n444\n00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.910\nNow that we've actually got this going and\nready to go.\n\n445\n00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.800\nLet's talk about this limitation here,\nand show you how this is limited.\n\n446\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.510\nNow if you remember that,\na little bit earlier here.\n\n447\n00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.650\nI showed you,\nif I go back to the install here.\n\n448\n00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.639\nThat there was the,\nlet me get the link back here.\n\n449\n00:23:21.431 --> 00:23:23.898\nThere was a link that\nactually said Install, right.\n\n450\n00:23:23.898 --> 00:23:26.503\nSo let me click on the right one,\nand that will do it right there.\n\n451\n00:23:26.503 --> 00:23:29.360\nInstall Office 2016, okay.\n\n452\n00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.790\nSo if you have that, it's perfectly fine.\n\n453\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.320\nBut what if you wanted to control that\n\n454\n00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.960\nto the point where you're not actually\nhaving to deal with that either?\n\n455\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.216\nWell, you can do that as well.\n\n456\n00:23:40.216 --> 00:23:43.244\nAnd the way that you do this and\ncontrol the install for\n\n457\n00:23:43.244 --> 00:23:46.953\nthe user-driven deployment fairly\neasily in a global setting.\n\n458\n00:23:46.953 --> 00:23:51.128\nIn other words across your entire\norganization is over here on the left\n\n459\n00:23:51.128 --> 00:23:51.843\nhand side.\n\n460\n00:23:51.843 --> 00:23:56.433\nOnce you click on the Admin tile in the\nhome then you get to the Admin Center and\n\n461\n00:23:56.433 --> 00:23:59.317\nover on the left hand side,\nI have these icons.\n\n462\n00:23:59.317 --> 00:24:01.439\nAnd you can see what\nthey're labeled as there.\n\n463\n00:24:01.439 --> 00:24:05.100\nThe top, the gray lettering\nthat draft she's seeing there.\n\n464\n00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.990\nBut what I'm looking for\nis the one that's called settings here.\n\n465\n00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.630\nAnd once I do that,\nthen I'm gonna select service and add ins.\n\n466\n00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.040\nNow on yours,\nmy resolution is set fairly low so\n\n467\n00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.620\nthat you can see it a little better.\n\n468\n00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.270\nBut on yours, it may actually have\nthe word setting right there for\n\n469\n00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.760\nyou right next to the icon too.\n\n470\n00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.805\nSo I'm gonna select service and\nadd ins and within service and\n\n471\n00:24:26.805 --> 00:24:31.250\nadd-ins, I can scroll down here and\nwhat I'm looking for\n\n472\n00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:35.710\nis Office software download settings,\nokay?\n\n473\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:40.100\nControl versions which Office\napps are available to download.\n\n474\n00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.830\nSo I can select that option.\n\n475\n00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:46.960\nAnd let me scroll out just a little bit,\nso that we can see it here.\n\n476\n00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.500\nAnd now, let me zoom in, so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n477\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.120\nChoose which software your\nusers can download and\n\n478\n00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.560\ninstall directly from Office 365/ If you\ndon't want users to install software\n\n479\n00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.860\nthemselves, notice you\ncan turn them all off.\n\n480\n00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.820\nOkay, and then you can come in and\n\n481\n00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.280\nsay, manually this is what\nI want you to do instead.\n\n482\n00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.070\nAnd that's what we're gonna end\nup doing in the later episode.\n\n483\n00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.270\nBut at this point I just want\nyou to see kind of default ways\n\n484\n00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.060\nthat we can control this situation here,\nokay.\n\n485\n00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.480\nSupport for\noffice 2013 has been discontinued and\n\n486\n00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.820\nwe get this nice notification for\nus if this is true.\n\n487\n00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.830\nBut now notice that I have the software\nfor PC, and then I have software for\n\n488\n00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:31.840\nMac, with the five user license\nI have the ability to install it\n\n489\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.590\nin the Mac version or\nalso in the Windows version as well.\n\n490\n00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:41.990\nSo what happens if I go look,\nI don't have any users with Mac.\n\n491\n00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.450\nWell, all I have to do is simply do that.\n\n492\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.760\nAnd that way it won't even show up.\n\n493\n00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.370\nIf I go ahead and\n\n494\n00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:52.700\nclick Save here, now it tells me that\nthe download settings have been updated.\n\n495\n00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.260\nNow we're gonna do something\na little bit fancier.\n\n496\n00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:02.050\nI'm gonna switch on over to my\nown Mac PC or my own Mac gear.\n\n497\n00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.890\nAnd when I do this,\nI'm gonna type in portal.\n\n498\n00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.550\nAnd I'm gonna sign is as Joey instead.\n\n499\n00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.860\nAnd you'll see a change,\nso there's IT, whoops.\n\n500\n00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.990\nWait, let me go back.\n\n501\n00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.302\nLet's see if I can change that.\n\n502\n00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:21.904\nAnd let's see if I can type\nin this password here.\n\n503\n00:26:28.997 --> 00:26:35.700\nAnd so this is Joey on a map here and\nnow let's take a look.\n\n504\n00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.970\nAs I logged in,\n\n505\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.630\ndo you notice anything that's missing\nfrom the upper right hand corner, Jackie?\n\n506\n00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:41.870\n&gt;&gt; The install button?\n\n507\n00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the install button.\n\n508\n00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.620\nIt is completely gone.\n\n509\n00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.860\nWhereas on the Windows,\nit was still there.\n\n510\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.860\nSo you can start seeing\nwhere something like this,\n\n511\n00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.930\nif a user is on a Mac, then,\nand we're saying look,\n\n512\n00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.770\nyou're not gonna install this on a Mac,\nwell now Joey doesn't have that choice.\n\n513\n00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.520\nHe doesn't get to say, yes I want to,\nif I don't want him to,\n\n514\n00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.220\nI simply have actually\nchanged that option for him.\n\n515\n00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.810\nAnd he's no longer able to\ninstall that on the Mac as well.\n\n516\n00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:11.800\nSo it really does help you when you\nstart to see something like this,\n\n517\n00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.730\nwhere this can actually\nbe changed very easily.\n\n518\n00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:19.470\nAnd if you just want to put that back, all\nyou have to do is change this back up and\n\n519\n00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.360\nthen you can click OK.\n\n520\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.990\nAnd now this will also be available.\n\n521\n00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:27.230\nNotice in the PC option though,\nthey give you a little bit more.\n\n522\n00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:30.710\nWhen I say that what we realize is\nthat not everybody's gonna need what?\n\n523\n00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:35.890\nSharePoint Designer or even the Skype\nstand alone for business app.\n\n524\n00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.870\nWell, I can limit that to now where\nthe Skype stand alone business app\n\n525\n00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:41.710\nisn't going to be there either.\n\n526\n00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:45.190\nI can also change how\noften updates happen here\n\n527\n00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:49.840\nvery easily by choosing these\ndefault options that are here.\n\n528\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.920\nAnd that will at least give some control\nthan we have over what end users can\n\n529\n00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:01.060\nput on their own computers if they choose\nto along with that limitation of those\n\n530\n00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:05.520\nfive licences that they have access to be\nable to install on to their computers.\n\n531\n00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.960\nBut by doing something like this,\nit really does give them that ability\n\n532\n00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.340\nand now if I go back\nover to the Mac again,\n\n533\n00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.750\nlet's see if that she brings me back\nagain all the way, all the way.\n\n534\n00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.410\nNo, it does have to log off.\n\n535\n00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:26.160\nBecause it just kind of keeps it there.\n\n536\n00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.230\n&gt;&gt; But it's so convenient.\n\n537\n00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.135\n&gt;&gt; I know it's.\n\n538\n00:28:30.135 --> 00:28:31.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Too convenient.\n\n539\n00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:35.459\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if I actually\nkind of log back in.\n\n540\n00:28:37.908 --> 00:28:38.833\nHere.\n\n541\n00:28:42.913 --> 00:28:44.815\nGo back.\n\n542\n00:28:48.047 --> 00:28:52.621\n&gt;&gt; And you're just seeing the ITProTV\nlogo because we actually use Office 365\n\n543\n00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:55.750\nhere at ITProTV and\nit's caching that information.\n\n544\n00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:00.150\n&gt;&gt; It is, and let's see this time.\n\n545\n00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:05.140\nThere you go, notice that it is now back\nand that is because I'm on the Mac again.\n\n546\n00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.790\nSo you can see that the control can\nbe done very quickly and easily.\n\n547\n00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:12.300\nSo those are kind of very generic and\nmacro controls.\n\n548\n00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.760\nNow you might think, well is that it,\n\n549\n00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.980\nis that all the controls\nthey have not really.\n\n550\n00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.170\nIf there are part of a domain,\nyou've still access to group policy.\n\n551\n00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.420\nYou can control in that method as well.\n\n552\n00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.260\nYou still have everything else that you\nhave access to, you can do all that stuff\n\n553\n00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.980\nthat you normally do under\na regular deployment as well.\n\n554\n00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.780\nBut at least here, you're no\nlonger having to manage software,\n\n555\n00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.240\nyou're no longer having to manage\nactivations and licencing very much\n\n556\n00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.800\nanymore, every user has their five and\ntheir off and they're ready to go.\n\n557\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.330\nBut at least that way you\ncan get started if you\n\n558\n00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:44.500\njust wanna choose that type of\nmanagement your off and ready to go.\n\n559\n00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.130\nBut we haven't even talked about\nanything like mobile Apps yet but\n\n560\n00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.410\nI think I've run out of time.\n\n561\n00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.070\n&gt;&gt; I know for this episode we have but\nreally ladies and\n\n562\n00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.460\ngentlemen we're just getting started.\n\n563\n00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.810\nSo stay tuned for more information.\n\n564\n00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.350\nFor this episode, we'll go ahead and sign\nout remember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n565\n00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n566\n00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.897\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:16.200\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Enabling Office\n365 Services series.\n\n4\n00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.290\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.920\nThis is actually a part two, where we will\ncontinue to manage client's deployments.\n\n6\n00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.440\nWith us today, in studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.200\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back in\nthe studios as we continue to take a look\n\n9\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.050\nat user-driven types of deployments here.\n\n10\n00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.700\nIn the very first episode that\nwe were talking about here,\n\n11\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.950\nin terms of deploying Office to those\ncomputers, we were really focusing in on\n\n12\n00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.230\nkinda the desktop issue, the one at\nhome and maybe even laptops overall.\n\n13\n00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.570\nBut we didn't really get into\nthe idea of actually, well,\n\n14\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.040\ninstalling and focusing in on,\nwell, mobile devices, too.\n\n15\n00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.490\nPart of the Office 365 solution that\nwe have, in terms of the installs,\n\n16\n00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.770\nit really does give us five\nlicenses that we can install.\n\n17\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.960\nBut it also gives us the ability to\ninstall these on mobile devices like\n\n18\n00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.840\nphones and tablets, as well.\n\n19\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.660\nAnd that's something that we\nalso need to be aware of,\n\n20\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.590\nespecially in this day of BYOD,\nbring your own device.\n\n21\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.330\nAnd the management of those things,\n\n22\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.840\ntoo, are really something\nthat we have to consider.\n\n23\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.600\nAnd this is another thing in which, when\nwe start talking about the deployment,\n\n24\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.714\nit seems to get a little bit scarier,\nright.\n\n25\n00:01:27.714 --> 00:01:32.878\nThe reason that it gets scarier is a lot\nof the BYOD, bring your own device, and\n\n26\n00:01:32.878 --> 00:01:38.513\nI'm emphasizing that on purpose, is that\nit's not the company's device anymore,\n\n27\n00:01:38.513 --> 00:01:42.130\nbut it's actually somebody else's device.\n\n28\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.870\nAnd that means somebody could actually\nget Office 365, as far as the software,\n\n29\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.220\ninstalled onto their particular,\nown device.\n\n30\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.490\nAnd now, if that person gets\nto leave the company for\n\n31\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.590\none reason or another,\nwhether it's voluntary,\n\n32\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.300\nwhether it's not voluntary, well, it\nbecomes a little bit more of a challenge,\n\n33\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.680\nright, when you start going, well, what\nthe heck happens to the Office 365 then?\n\n34\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.700\nSo, Cherokee, if that were to happen\nin the ways that we were talking about\n\n35\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.330\na traditional deployment, right, that we\ninstalled something onto that end user's\n\n36\n00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.140\nhome computer, and now they happened\nto have to leave the company, well,\n\n37\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.240\nthey've still got Office\non their computer, right.\n\n38\n00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah, and although it may belong\nto the company, once they've already\n\n39\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.110\nutilized that key, then a lot of times\nthey would just kind of keep it, I guess.\n\n40\n00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI mean there's not a lot that you can do.\n\n41\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.140\nIf everything's managed on\nthat volume license key,\n\n42\n00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.110\nyou can't just revoke the entire key\ncuz that revokes it for everybody.\n\n43\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.799\nBut that particular license, then,\nessentially ends up getting lost, right.\n\n44\n00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.280\nEven though as a part of your company,\nyou're no longer accessing it,\n\n45\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.400\nyou're no longer using it, whoever that\nemployee is, whatever is on their own home\n\n46\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.960\ndevice, well, it pretty much becomes\ntheirs, and they're using it.\n\n47\n00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.955\nAs long as they don't probably reformat\nthe computer, they're probably fine, and\n\n48\n00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:03.021\nthey're dandy, and they're ready to go.\n\n49\n00:03:03.021 --> 00:03:06.793\nWell, think about the monetary loss that\nwas, right, cuz that software could be\n\n50\n00:03:06.793 --> 00:03:10.620\nseveral hundred dollars worth of\nsoftware that we're talking about.\n\n51\n00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.490\nAnd now you don't have access to it.\n\n52\n00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.440\nYou can say, all right, Cherokee,\n\n53\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.100\nhere it is, we need you to remove\nthat software from the computer.\n\n54\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.320\nCherokee can just look right back\nat me and go, did it, [LAUGH] and\n\n55\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.720\nnot really have done anything at all.\n\n56\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.280\nSo when we start to move into this\narena then, right, with Office 365,\n\n57\n00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.030\nas easy as it is to deploy,\nand with the five licenses,\n\n58\n00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.740\nit doesn't matter whether it's actually\non machines that are owned by you, or\n\n59\n00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.990\nwhether it's on machines that\nare not owned by your company.\n\n60\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.760\nThey have those five licenses and they\ncan actually use it however they want to.\n\n61\n00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.690\nBut then they also get additional licenses\nto install it on mobile devices, as well.\n\n62\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.150\nAnd that's something that\nwe also have to consider.\n\n63\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.490\nSo is there any way that we actually can\n\n64\n00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.760\ntake a look at doing something\nlike this when we start to have to\n\n65\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.220\ndeal with getting these things\nonto the computers themselves?\n\n66\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\nalso with Office 365 running,\n\n67\n00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.260\nwe have access to different types of\nstores, like the Windows App Store.\n\n68\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.320\nIs there any kind of issues that we\nshould be aware of when we're dealing\n\n69\n00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.330\nwith these additional applications?\n\n70\n00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.380\n&gt;&gt; There are, right.\n\n71\n00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.730\nThe very fact is you're not gonna get\nit with every single subscription that\n\n72\n00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.160\nyou have, okay.\n\n73\n00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.531\nSo what it comes down to when people say,\nhey, I want this on my mobile device,\n\n74\n00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.974\nI want this on my smartphone,\nI want this on my tablet, well,\n\n75\n00:04:28.974 --> 00:04:33.127\nit comes down to the idea of different\nplans that are available out there.\n\n76\n00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:38.713\nAnd Microsoft kind of divides up into\nwhat we call qualifying plans and\n\n77\n00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:40.803\nnon-qualifying plans.\n\n78\n00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:42.494\nI was trying to make sure I\nsaid the right terms, here.\n\n79\n00:04:42.494 --> 00:04:45.482\nSo let's take a look at those\nplans just briefly, here.\n\n80\n00:04:45.482 --> 00:04:48.431\nSo on my computer, I went ahead and\nbrought this up in my browser.\n\n81\n00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:50.980\nAnd this link will be\navailable in the show notes,\n\n82\n00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.024\nas they're posted along with the episode,\nitself, too.\n\n83\n00:04:54.024 --> 00:04:56.571\nAnd it says, hey,\nwhat can you do in Office apps,\n\n84\n00:04:56.571 --> 00:04:58.900\non Android, iOS, Windows mobile?\n\n85\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.290\nYou name it,\nit actually does give you a gamut, right.\n\n86\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.530\nSo it doesn't matter if you're\non a Windows mobile phone,\n\n87\n00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.135\nwhether you're on an iPhone, or whether\nyou're talking about an Android device.\n\n88\n00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:13.150\nIf you have access to\nan Office 365 subscription,\n\n89\n00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.960\nyou can do some of these\nthings with Office.\n\n90\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.770\nBut before you can do anything,\nokay, you have to check and\n\n91\n00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.600\nsee what you can actually do\nin the Office apps, itself.\n\n92\n00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.193\nAnd it depends on whether or\nnot your plan is either a qualifying or\n\n93\n00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:32.049\na non-qualifying plan,\nas were stated here, okay.\n\n94\n00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:34.977\nSo at the very beginning, what can we do?\n\n95\n00:05:34.977 --> 00:05:39.340\nThat's kind of a key aspect for\nwhat we wanna pay attention to, right.\n\n96\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.660\nSo if you're part of that qualifying plan,\nyou can view documents.\n\n97\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.340\nYou can do some basic editing,\n\n98\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.580\nwhich is perfectly fine,\nsomething that you want to be able to do.\n\n99\n00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.160\nAnd notice it says extra\nfeatures in the apps, itself.\n\n100\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.940\nSo as long as you actually know\nwhat those features are, and\n\n101\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.490\nyou can do that,\nyou definitely have access to that.\n\n102\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.690\nBut if you're on a non-qualifying plan,\nyou can look at documents.\n\n103\n00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.720\nBasic editing here means you can change\na few things, but you're not actually in\n\n104\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.670\nthere to be able to rename the entire\nfile or do anything like that.\n\n105\n00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.570\nSo this is where it also becomes key for\nus to understand, too, that\n\n106\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.320\nusers may actually end up on a plan that\nwe didn't realize that they ended up on.\n\n107\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.650\nAnd so they're either saying,\n\n108\n00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.050\non my Android phone I can look at files,\nbut I can't do any editing, okay.\n\n109\n00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.930\nI can't collaborate,\nI can't do whatever it might be.\n\n110\n00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.010\nYou might find out that,\n\n111\n00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.130\neven though you thought that they were\non the plan that you thought that they\n\n112\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.300\nwere on, they might not actually be on\nthe plan that is part of what you want.\n\n113\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.250\nSo for example, here, and let's kind of\nfocus in on just a few of them, okay.\n\n114\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.618\nSo notice that on\nthe non-qualifying plans,\n\n115\n00:06:46.618 --> 00:06:49.050\nyou have one-time purchase versions.\n\n116\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.730\nWell, those don't qualify.\n\n117\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.370\nVolume license versions\ndon't qualify either, okay.\n\n118\n00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.910\nAnd then you have subscriptions\nwithout an Office license, and\n\n119\n00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.818\nthis is where we have to be careful.\n\n120\n00:07:00.818 --> 00:07:05.799\nNotice, especially in terms of a\ncommercial venture, everybody always goes,\n\n121\n00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:08.961\nokay, the office enterprise is an E plan,\nright.\n\n122\n00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:13.793\nThere's E1, 2, 3, or E1, 3, 4 or 5.\n\n123\n00:07:13.793 --> 00:07:14.705\nThere may even be 2 and 3.\n\n124\n00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:16.910\n&gt;&gt; And these are just levels of access?\n\n125\n00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\njust different subscription bases.\n\n126\n00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.550\nBut the E1, which is you'd\nthink is an enterprise plan,\n\n127\n00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.100\nis actually considered\na non-qualifying plan.\n\n128\n00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.047\nThat's weird because we're saying,\nhey, this for enterprise users, right.\n\n129\n00:07:29.047 --> 00:07:33.220\nAnd that's considered\na non-qualifiying plan here.\n\n130\n00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.360\nSo you do have to be careful\nwhen you start to take a look.\n\n131\n00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.100\nThe other ones that you\nalso have available to you,\n\n132\n00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.210\nthen, are of course these qualifying\nsubscription plans, as well.\n\n133\n00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.550\nNotice that the Home,\nPersonal and University editions,\n\n134\n00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.700\nthose things are available, and\nyou now have access to them.\n\n135\n00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.802\nOf course, even for\nyour mobile devices, as well.\n\n136\n00:07:51.802 --> 00:07:54.629\nThis is where it gets a little\nbit trickier, at least for me.\n\n137\n00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:57.832\nNow, Cherokee, you may be able to\nfigure all this out very easily.\n\n138\n00:07:57.832 --> 00:08:02.727\nBut this is where I kind of get a little\nbit unusual here because I start to\n\n139\n00:08:02.727 --> 00:08:07.638\nnotice something that I thought,\nthis should be equivalent, right?\n\n140\n00:08:07.638 --> 00:08:12.960\nTake a look at this right here.\n\n141\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.180\nNotice it says Office 365 ProPlus, right.\n\n142\n00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:22.960\nNow, if I were looking at that and\nI also looked at this.\n\n143\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.600\nWhat do you think ProPlus stands for?\n\n144\n00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.560\n&gt;&gt; Professional Plus, the abbreviated\nversion of that other variation?\n\n145\n00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.928\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I would think too,\nand than we would be wrong of course.\n\n146\n00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:33.985\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Of course.\n\n147\n00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:37.561\n&gt;&gt; You know like anything else,\nwe would be absolutely 100% wrong here.\n\n148\n00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:40.733\nIt is strange how their nomenclature,\n\n149\n00:08:40.733 --> 00:08:45.537\ntheir naming of these things is so\npoor here that you can have\n\n150\n00:08:45.537 --> 00:08:50.440\na non-qualifying plan called\nOffice Professional Plus and\n\n151\n00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.262\nthen you abbreviate a qualifying plan and\nyou call it what?\n\n152\n00:08:55.262 --> 00:09:00.395\nOffice 365 ProPlus, which you would\nthink would be an abbreviation or\n\n153\n00:09:00.395 --> 00:09:04.440\na very abbreviated version\nof Professional Plus.\n\n154\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:11.210\nSo, in this particular instance here,\nit is a poor, poor naming concept because\n\n155\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.340\nif I were to get anything confused,\n&gt;&gt; That would be it.\n\n156\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.320\n&gt;&gt; It would be it.\n\n157\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:21.700\nSo if I had a user come to me and\nsay, I have Office Professional Plus\n\n158\n00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.536\non my computer and I should be able to\nget this onto my mobile phone, right?\n\n159\n00:09:26.536 --> 00:09:31.340\nWell, I would probably at the first\nsentence here would have said yes,\n\n160\n00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.860\nabsolutely, that this is\nwhat would end up happening.\n\n161\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.528\nBut by looking at this,\nnotice that it is different here.\n\n162\n00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:41.280\nOffice 365 ProPlus here\n\n163\n00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.290\nis different than what we see right here\nin terms of Office Professional Plus.\n\n164\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.290\nTo me, that actually kind of is something\nthat I wish that they would change.\n\n165\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.385\nThey're probably not, cuz they're\nprobably not gonna listen to me.\n\n166\n00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:54.064\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the very fact is,\n\n167\n00:09:54.064 --> 00:09:59.654\nthat it is confusing enough, so confusing\nthat it may actually even be on the exam.\n\n168\n00:09:59.654 --> 00:10:03.786\nSo I would kind of take a look and\nremember that you've got to know whether\n\n169\n00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:07.919\nor not you're gonna have access to\nthese mobile types of install in a user\n\n170\n00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:11.275\ndriven deployment,\njust by whether it's a qualifying.\n\n171\n00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:15.801\nAnd if I were to pick one of these out\nto be kind of the exam writer, right,\n\n172\n00:10:15.801 --> 00:10:20.110\nI'd go yeah, if there's gonna\nbe anyone I could see that.\n\n173\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.530\nNotice like this one on\nthe non-qualifying, the Office Standard.\n\n174\n00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.790\nLook over here on the qualifying plans.\n\n175\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.910\nNothing really says standard over there.\n\n176\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:32.580\nSo that's easy enough for me, Standard,\nnot a qualifying plan, right?\n\n177\n00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.670\nThat makes sense, but when you start\ngetting into something like this where\n\n178\n00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.810\nProPlus, Professional Plus here.\n\n179\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.120\nYeah, that's a little bit more tricky.\n\n180\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.150\nNow, don't get me wrong,\nyou do see Office 365 which\n\n181\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.510\ntells you it is a cloud based version and\nthat should be enough.\n\n182\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.990\nBut at the same time,\n\n183\n00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.770\nI would have told you all day long,\nthat's an equivalent thing.\n\n184\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.350\n&gt;&gt; That's what I've got going on.\n\n185\n00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:00.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so these are things\nthat you do have to pay attention to\n\n186\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.920\nwhen you start seeing things like this.\n\n187\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.490\nSo, realize these two different plans here\n\n188\n00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.700\ncan kind of give you some heartache\nif you're not exactly sure.\n\n189\n00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:15.730\nSo make sure that if you are trying to\nget these on your company's smartphones,\n\n190\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.230\ntablets, and of course,\nend users that bring BYOD stuff and\n\n191\n00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:25.510\nthey're not able to, check the qualifying\nplan first and foremost when they do that.\n\n192\n00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.430\nThat's probably gonna be the key\nfeature that will not allow\n\n193\n00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.490\nthem to install it on the phone,\nokay, first and foremost here.\n\n194\n00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.090\nNow there are some other issues\nthat we need to talk about\n\n195\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.410\nwith some of the mobile apps too.\n\n196\n00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:43.120\nA lot of times,\nusers can also use correct account,\n\n197\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.000\nwhen we actually install them,\nmake sure I'm reading this right.\n\n198\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.440\nWhen you install them onto the phone,\nyou've gotta be careful.\n\n199\n00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.446\nAs an administrator, if you go all right,\ngo to your phone and do this and\n\n200\n00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:58.322\ngo let me just bring it to you and\nyou install underneath your account,\n\n201\n00:11:58.322 --> 00:12:02.670\nwell that's gonna actually log it in for\nyour account and not theirs.\n\n202\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.940\nSo make sure you do use\nthe correct account for\n\n203\n00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.170\nthe proper subscription that they have\nthat they're also available as well.\n\n204\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.060\nNow also because of the small,\n\n205\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:17.630\ntiny screens, even with the big old\ngigantic kind of Note devices and\n\n206\n00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:23.160\nthe iPhone 6++,\n7 version of iPhone that's out there.\n\n207\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.210\nEven with all that,\nyou still have to check for typos.\n\n208\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:32.510\nAnd I am notorious for these ideas of\nthe typos, so you can see that too.\n\n209\n00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:38.460\nNow the only one that's super specific\nthough that Office 365 points out,\n\n210\n00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.955\nis that when you say,\n\n211\n00:12:39.955 --> 00:12:45.670\nhey I'm gonna install the Office\nproducts onto my phone, okay.\n\n212\n00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.890\nOr onto my iPad and\nif you go to the iPad, and\n\n213\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:54.260\nall of a sudden it says No Subscription\nFound when you get in there,\n\n214\n00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.350\nthey have a specific recommendation for\nyou.\n\n215\n00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:02.380\nWhich is on the iPad, go ahead and\nre-set the entire app if you do this.\n\n216\n00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.150\nIf the Apple ID says no\nsubscription found, or\n\n217\n00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:10.880\nthis Apple ID doesn't have an Office 365\nsubscription and you know that you do,\n\n218\n00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.820\njust reset the app and\nthat also ends up working for you as well.\n\n219\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.780\nSo it is kind of unusual,\n\n220\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.750\nbut on the iPad apparently there's been a\nlot of issues, so much that they really do\n\n221\n00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.620\ngive you a specific here's what you've\ngotta do if you really want it to work and\n\n222\n00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.510\nyou're getting these specific\nerrors that end up happening here.\n\n223\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.840\nSo do take a look that,\nbut at the key here for\n\n224\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.670\nthese mobile devices begin\nwith figuring out whether or\n\n225\n00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:38.210\nnot you have a qualifying plan or\na non-qualifying plan to start with too.\n\n226\n00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.240\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, if we go back to that\nquestion I had asked previously about\n\n227\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.600\nkind of just controlling the situation.\n\n228\n00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.020\nLet's talk about activation and\nrevocation, how does that all play out?\n\n229\n00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:53.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when we actually\nfinally get the users installing\n\n230\n00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:58.830\nonto whether their PC, MacBook,\nlaptop, or mobile device.\n\n231\n00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.920\nWe've gotta remember that a big part\nof this, right, is the licensing and\n\n232\n00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.360\nof course, the activation itself.\n\n233\n00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.370\nEven with the five licenses that\nevery individual user has access to,\n\n234\n00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.410\nthey have to activate.\n\n235\n00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.700\nRemember that activation is\nthe anti-piracy technique\n\n236\n00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.735\nthat Microsoft chooses to use to\nvalidate that they have that valid and\n\n237\n00:14:18.735 --> 00:14:23.880\nlicensed subscription that allows them to\nuse the product that's on their computer.\n\n238\n00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.540\nWell, let's understand that process\nfirst when we take a look at activation,\n\n239\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.500\nand we'll talk about\nrevocation along the way too.\n\n240\n00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.120\nSo as you take a look at my screen,\nI've created a simple diagram to help\n\n241\n00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.596\nus out here, so that we understand\nwhat happens when it begins here.\n\n242\n00:14:39.596 --> 00:14:44.503\nSo let's take for an example Client01 that\nwhen we install, by clicking on the link\n\n243\n00:14:44.503 --> 00:14:48.320\nin the upper right hand corner\nof our Office 365 subscription,\n\n244\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.773\nthe first thing that will end up happening\nof course is that we'll download.\n\n245\n00:14:52.773 --> 00:14:57.697\nAnd traditionally it downloads\nthis Office 2016 ProPlus edition\n\n246\n00:14:57.697 --> 00:15:03.180\nonto your computer for you to be\nable to install and work with right?\n\n247\n00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:08.220\nWhen that now actually gets installed and\nbegins to work, the first thing that\n\n248\n00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:14.400\nhappens is now it will make a connection\nback to the Office 365 cloud and\n\n249\n00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.540\nthe Office licensing service\nitself will go ahead and\n\n250\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.260\nissue a license key at that point.\n\n251\n00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.459\nAt the same time, once the license key\nis installed into the Office client,\n\n252\n00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:31.080\nthis is without you and me doing any\ninteraction during the install process.\n\n253\n00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.325\nWhen that happens and\nit finishes and it does this,\n\n254\n00:15:34.325 --> 00:15:39.456\nthe other part then will also communicate\nwith what's called the Activation and\n\n255\n00:15:39.456 --> 00:15:42.862\nValidation Service that\nwill then activate the key.\n\n256\n00:15:42.862 --> 00:15:47.822\nSo this connection that we have\nout to the Office 365 cloud during\n\n257\n00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:52.699\nthe installation process is a very\nimportant process because this\n\n258\n00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:56.982\nis what tracks the initial part\nthat issues out a license.\n\n259\n00:15:56.982 --> 00:16:02.004\nAnd then from that point on to have\nthe key activated were normally\n\n260\n00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:07.228\nremaining connected into Office\n365 Cloud as well will happen.\n\n261\n00:16:07.228 --> 00:16:11.632\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Ronnie, really what's going\non here you're saying that in order for\n\n262\n00:16:11.632 --> 00:16:14.985\nthat on and Office 365 client\nto have that key activated,\n\n263\n00:16:14.985 --> 00:16:18.993\ndo they have to have a constant connection\nor is it something that sending\n\n264\n00:16:18.993 --> 00:16:22.238\nout intermittent communication,\nor how does that work?\n\n265\n00:16:22.238 --> 00:16:24.360\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\na great question here.\n\n266\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.620\nThe very fact is, well you can say yes and\nno at this point, right?\n\n267\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.620\nThe activation has to occur online.\n\n268\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.230\nSo there's not like a phone\ncall that you get to make and\n\n269\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.130\ngo, I need to activate my phone.\n\n270\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.060\nYou have to be connected somehow.\n\n271\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.340\nBut do we actually have to stay\nconnected all of the time?\n\n272\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.480\nDo we need a constant Internet connection?\n\n273\n00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.240\nWell, that's not necessarily so, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.960\nWith the way that this works,\nif we take a look at my computer here,\n\n275\n00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.970\nI'm gonna flip on over to another tab.\n\n276\n00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.440\nAnd here you'll see\nwhat ends up happening.\n\n277\n00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.390\nWhen you log in to your machine, and\nif you're using the same account as\n\n278\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.920\nthe one that you also have\nyour Office 365 account.\n\n279\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.760\nIf you're doing that and you're,\nyou're pretty much logged in.\n\n280\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.860\nAs long as your machine is logged in and\n\n281\n00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.282\nyou're ready to go when\nyou launch an application.\n\n282\n00:17:09.282 --> 00:17:14.750\nWhat's gonna happen is, every time\nyou log in your key gets validated.\n\n283\n00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.286\nSo, if you're logging in and you're\nconnected to the internet it will just\n\n284\n00:17:18.286 --> 00:17:21.190\nre-validate your key,\nessentially extending it.\n\n285\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.240\nThe initial validation period\nis about 30 days long,\n\n286\n00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.590\nbut overall though, that's what ends up\nhappening every single time you log in.\n\n287\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.320\nSo it does help, but\nwhat if you're not logged in?\n\n288\n00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.534\nWell, It's gonna say, all right,\nI'll just wait and see.\n\n289\n00:17:34.534 --> 00:17:35.658\nHe's gonna log in sooner or later.\n\n290\n00:17:35.658 --> 00:17:36.390\n&gt;&gt; Eventually.\n\n291\n00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.830\n&gt;&gt; And then,\nthis is what ends up happening.\n\n292\n00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.260\nSo, at this particular point though,\n\n293\n00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.444\nwith this every 30 days validation\nthat's really what it means,\n\n294\n00:17:44.444 --> 00:17:47.830\nis that you really have to be\nconnected once every 30 days or so.\n\n295\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:48.800\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n296\n00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n297\n00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.510\nSo when we start to take a look at what\nhappens then what if we are actually then\n\n298\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:59.610\ndisconnected at this point from Office\n365 for longer than 30 days, okay?\n\n299\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:00.576\n&gt;&gt; That would be a great vacation.\n\n300\n00:18:00.576 --> 00:18:03.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that might be a vacation here.\n\n301\n00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.270\nBut it's not gonna help you out, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:09.710\nSo this is where we have to think\nabout this idea here, okay?\n\n303\n00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.750\nSo if you go on your computer and\n\n304\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.880\nyou're not connected to the internet for\nlonger than 30 days.\n\n305\n00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.470\nWell, the Office that is now\ninstalled onto your computer\n\n306\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.500\nwill enter into what's called\nreduced functionality mode.\n\n307\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.760\nAnd that reduced functionality\nmode is kinda strange, right?\n\n308\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.320\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like me on the Monday morning.\n\n309\n00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.990\n&gt;&gt; It could be yeah, so\n\n310\n00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.630\nwhen you do this what you'll actually\nbe able to see and do is this.\n\n311\n00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.820\nYou'll be able to see\nthe documents that you have.\n\n312\n00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:39.660\nYou'll even be able to print them, but\nyou won't be able to create new files nor\n\n313\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:44.110\nwill you be able to edit\nany of these files as well.\n\n314\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.030\nSo then there's the reduced functionality.\n\n315\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.330\nNow at that point, right,\nwhat do we have to do?\n\n316\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.800\n&gt;&gt; Well, what if the end user,\nwe know that we have five installations.\n\n317\n00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.270\nBut what if someone tries or\nattempts to install a sixth installation?\n\n318\n00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.860\n&gt;&gt; Once you actually get to that point,\nright,\n\n319\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.630\nand you have those five licenses and then\nyou have the sixth license or the sixth\n\n320\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.000\ninstall, it's kind of neat because what\nends up happening is that when you go and\n\n321\n00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.080\ntry and install, it's gonna tell you, hey,\nwe're not allowing you to install this\n\n322\n00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.630\nuntil you uninstall it\nfrom another device.\n\n323\n00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:23.200\nSo the great thing is, the end user can\nmanage that on his own as well, okay?\n\n324\n00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.020\nNow, let me also kind of\nbring that back around\n\n325\n00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.770\nto something I was about\nto answer as well.\n\n326\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.880\nSo if you stay disconnected\nlonger than 30 days here,\n\n327\n00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.350\nright., just for a brief moment.\n\n328\n00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.850\nThe only thing you have to do,\nyou don't have to go and call anybody.\n\n329\n00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.180\nYou don't have to do anything else.\n\n330\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.301\nYou just have to connect again and\nas long as you didn't deactivate that\n\n331\n00:19:41.301 --> 00:19:44.193\nsubscription, then you're ready to go,\nokay?\n\n332\n00:19:44.193 --> 00:19:48.119\nSo in other words, even if you're off for\n30 days, you connect back, it's gonna\n\n333\n00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:52.211\nre-validate that key as long as it didn't\nget something from Office 365 saying no,\n\n334\n00:19:52.211 --> 00:19:53.229\nit was deactivated.\n\n335\n00:19:53.229 --> 00:19:54.250\n&gt;&gt; They didn't pay their bill.\n[LAUGH]\n\n336\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:54.794\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they didn't pay their bill,\n\n337\n00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:56.437\nit's gone, you have that too.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n338\n00:19:56.437 --> 00:20:00.725\n&gt;&gt; But with that six license let's go and\ntake a look at that too,\n\n339\n00:20:00.725 --> 00:20:03.295\nlet me get back into the client here.\n\n340\n00:20:03.295 --> 00:20:07.461\nAnd let's take a look at the management\nof our licenses and that's kind of a key,\n\n341\n00:20:07.461 --> 00:20:10.600\nsomething that the end user\ndoesn't need to know about too.\n\n342\n00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:17.830\nIf I click on this gear up here,\nthen I scroll down,\n\n343\n00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:22.928\nI can actually see my app settings\nright here for Office 365.\n\n344\n00:20:22.928 --> 00:20:28.098\nAnd when I do that it should\nbring us up into these\n\n345\n00:20:28.098 --> 00:20:33.802\nsettings over here, and\nselect software install.\n\n346\n00:20:37.796 --> 00:20:40.770\nIt's right here,\nI probably could've gone to my account.\n\n347\n00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.560\nAt least that's what\nit's showing right here.\n\n348\n00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.290\nSo I have kinda went the long\nway around my elbow to get here.\n\n349\n00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.130\nAnd I go to the install status,\nwell then I can take a look and\n\n350\n00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:56.400\nsee how many devices that this has been\ninstalled in under Joey's account.\n\n351\n00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.960\nIf I had had five here and\na six one to, on Cherokee's computer.\n\n352\n00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.720\nIt would come in and say,\nhey you need to deactivate one of this.\n\n353\n00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.900\nSo the good thing is,\nit really means that, hey,\n\n354\n00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.200\nyou don't have to call in Bobby\nyou can be activated here.\n\n355\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.960\n&gt;&gt; And\ni'm assuming your gonna show as Ronnie.\n\n356\n00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n357\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.340\n&gt;&gt; How to go ahead and\ndeactivate one of these account?\n\n358\n00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:17.240\n&gt;&gt; Well, yup,\nwe can actually do that for right now.\n\n359\n00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.460\nAs we actually take a look\nat deactivating and\n\n360\n00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.310\nall you have to do is simply\nclick deactivate right here.\n\n361\n00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.190\nAnd that will deactivate the account.\n\n362\n00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:32.330\nThen when the user in\nhimself tries to go ahead and\n\n363\n00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.890\nconnect back in it's gonna say, it's been\ndeactivated and do you want to reactivate?\n\n364\n00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.960\nWell if it's underneath your account\nit's gonna try to reactivate again.\n\n365\n00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.320\nThat should be fine.\n\n366\n00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.780\nBut if you try and\n\n367\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.880\nmake this happen and your account is now\nclosed, it's not going to end up working.\n\n368\n00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.510\nSo let me select,\nlet's see I actually haven't installed it.\n\n369\n00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.150\nThis is actually of\nsomebody else's computer.\n\n370\n00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:53.915\nI better not do that right now.\n\n371\n00:21:53.915 --> 00:21:55.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nLet's not do that.\n\n372\n00:21:55.264 --> 00:21:56.332\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n373\n00:21:56.332 --> 00:21:58.380\nI was looking at this I'm like,\nno that's not my computer.\n\n374\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.640\nBut this is not my computer.\n\n375\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.430\nThe great thing is, you can see like\neven the different versions here.\n\n376\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.610\nSo, this one.\n\n377\n00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:06.540\n&gt;&gt; Tell you the operating system, yep.\n\n378\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.417\n&gt;&gt; And here it is, here's the operating\nsystem and the install dates.\n\n379\n00:22:09.417 --> 00:22:11.985\nYeah, these have been around\na little bit of time,\n\n380\n00:22:11.985 --> 00:22:15.225\nso better not do that in case\nmesses with somebody else's show.\n\n381\n00:22:15.225 --> 00:22:20.300\nBut that's how simple it really is\nto go ahead and be able to do this.\n\n382\n00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.390\nSo, once you actually\nremove that status there.\n\n383\n00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.270\nThat's exactly what will end up happening.\n\n384\n00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.800\nYou'll be able to deactivate that.\n\n385\n00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.310\nYou'll be able to close that off\nif you need to do this too, okay?\n\n386\n00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:37.370\nNow the other thing we also want to\ntake a look at as well of course,\n\n387\n00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.680\nis a couple of things, right?\n\n388\n00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.470\nWe've talked about this idea of the Mac\ncomputer form, we also wanna show you just\n\n389\n00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:48.660\nbriefly the install on and actually\na mobile phone, cuz that was something\n\n390\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.900\nI didn't, I kind of forgot about and\nwe'll bring that around too, okay?\n\n391\n00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.900\nAnything special with\nthe idea of a Mac install?\n\n392\n00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.180\nNot really, okay?\n\n393\n00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.730\nAs long as you don't block the install\nto a Mac computer It will install, but\n\n394\n00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:02.838\nthere are limitations.\n\n395\n00:23:02.838 --> 00:23:06.580\nYou are gonna end up finding out something\nlike I did the first time I installed it.\n\n396\n00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.680\nIt doesn't have the full functionality as\nwhat you have within inside of Windows.\n\n397\n00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.820\nWhen you're talking about Word or Excel or\nany of the other ones, it really doesn't.\n\n398\n00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.810\nBut you are also missing\na couple of components too.\n\n399\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:22.100\nSo for example you won't have access\nto the access database program,\n\n400\n00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.510\nMicrosoft Access.\n\n401\n00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.650\nSo that's not gonna be there.\n\n402\n00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.950\nPublisher is not gonna be there.\n\n403\n00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.910\nAnd the same thing even\nwith the Office Pro+.\n\n404\n00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.180\nPublisher is not considered\nreally apart of it.\n\n405\n00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.450\nIt's an add on that you can add in there.\n\n406\n00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:39.210\nBut overall, that was not gonna be a part\nof the Mac install itself as well.\n\n407\n00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.980\nSo those will not be available either.\n\n408\n00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.000\nSo the Mac,\nthere's not really much of a difference.\n\n409\n00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.560\nIt'll show up here in the install.\n\n410\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.470\nJust like what we actually\nsaw right here on the screen.\n\n411\n00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.428\nLet me show you again one\ntime here on my screen here.\n\n412\n00:23:51.428 --> 00:23:52.305\n&gt;&gt; Good to know.\n&gt;&gt; And you'll see.\n\n413\n00:23:52.305 --> 00:23:53.160\n&gt;&gt; Nothing major-\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n414\n00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.138\n&gt;&gt; Different with the installation.\n\n415\n00:23:54.138 --> 00:23:57.239\nJust knowing those limitations\nas far as the software goes.\n\n416\n00:23:57.239 --> 00:24:00.131\n&gt;&gt; Right, so at this point,\nas long as you don't go that five.\n\n417\n00:24:00.131 --> 00:24:02.038\nSo remember we said that there were.\n\n418\n00:24:02.038 --> 00:24:07.100\nTwo installs and you can see whether's\nit's Mac or Windows here, Windows or Mac.\n\n419\n00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.930\nThere's the two installs\nthat we have on hand.\n\n420\n00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.940\nAnd let's also take a look at what\nhappens when we choose to try and\n\n421\n00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.820\ninstall this with onto my phone.\n\n422\n00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.540\nSo we're gonna actually take a look\nat my phone for a moment and\n\n423\n00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.830\nwe'll do it that way as well.\n\n424\n00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.440\nLet me get back over to my computer.\n\n425\n00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.190\nAnd select this here.\n\n426\n00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.200\nSo there's a couple of options that\nyou have to be able to do this.\n\n427\n00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.190\nYou can go to the Play Store, right?\n\n428\n00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.080\nThe Google Play Store and\nif you do this you wanna make\n\n429\n00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.920\nsure you do go to the official Play Store,\ndownload each of the individual apps.\n\n430\n00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:46.540\nBut the other way to do this, is to\nconnect into what Office 365 cellphone,\n\n431\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.140\nmake sure I'm plugged in good, here.\n\n432\n00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:55.930\nAnd I'll type in portal.office.com, and\nlet me see if I can zoom in just briefly.\n\n433\n00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.480\n&gt;&gt; I see Joey.\n\n434\n00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.837\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, I don't wanna close that.\n\n435\n00:24:58.837 --> 00:25:03.716\nI don't wanna try and use that on the,\nsee if I can type it.\n\n436\n00:25:03.716 --> 00:25:08.737\nOops.\n\n437\n00:25:12.684 --> 00:25:14.785\nAnd let's see what happens here.\n\n438\n00:25:14.785 --> 00:25:16.432\nSo in just a moment if it logs in,\n\n439\n00:25:16.432 --> 00:25:19.547\nI'm just using this software\nthat connects you to my phone.\n\n440\n00:25:19.547 --> 00:25:20.683\nAnd there we go.\n\n441\n00:25:20.683 --> 00:25:23.086\nSo now, I'm logged in as Joey.\n\n442\n00:25:23.086 --> 00:25:27.231\nAnd now notice it gives me\neverything right here on the phone.\n\n443\n00:25:27.231 --> 00:25:30.440\nIn about one or\ntwo I can get Office apps here.\n\n444\n00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.650\nAnd let's see where it brings me.\n\n445\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.660\nIt brings me into\nthe Office products here.\n\n446\n00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.290\nIt says Get Office for Android.\n\n447\n00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.630\nSo it's enter your email and\nthen it sends me a download link.\n\n448\n00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.840\nAnd that's what you're\ngonna end up seeing.\n\n449\n00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.900\nIt's gonna send you a link and\nthen you'll connect that link.\n\n450\n00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.550\nAnd once you do so, you'll be able\nto install it on to that computer.\n\n451\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.810\nAnd then, of course,\nyou may have to sign in again.\n\n452\n00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.595\nNow, if you don't want that stuff,\nI'd just tell it to go ahead and\n\n453\n00:25:59.595 --> 00:26:04.050\nsend me this link here.\n\n454\n00:26:05.533 --> 00:26:10.234\njoey@officeprodemoco on Microsoft.com.\n\n455\n00:26:16.225 --> 00:26:17.350\nSee if I can actually.\n\n456\n00:26:18.755 --> 00:26:20.305\n&gt;&gt; Error.\n\n457\n00:26:20.305 --> 00:26:22.390\n&gt;&gt; There's an error here.\n\n458\n00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.540\nOkay so I wanna try and send that message.\n\n459\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.130\nIt did not like it.\n\n460\n00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.650\nSo either I typed it in wrong\nwhich is very possible.\n\n461\n00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.194\n&gt;&gt; But just like a lot of different\ntypes of verification that we see today.\n\n462\n00:26:33.194 --> 00:26:35.870\nIt's kind of having\nan additional layer of security.\n\n463\n00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.553\nIf we're sending that install\nlink right to your email.\n\n464\n00:26:39.553 --> 00:26:42.013\nWhich should be the email\nthat you've already provided,\n\n465\n00:26:42.013 --> 00:26:44.170\nthen that's associated with this account.\n\n466\n00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:44.670\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n467\n00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.750\nSo we'll see,\nwe actually get it this time or not.\n\n468\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.080\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And then error is out again.\n\n469\n00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.280\nIt may just be my connection on my phone.\n\n470\n00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.240\nThat we are not able to do.\n\n471\n00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.990\nSee it says a message is now being sent.\n\n472\n00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.070\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie when this email comes\nthrough, do we need to be checking our\n\n473\n00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.710\nemail on the mobile device, if we will\nbe downloading it on that device?\n\n474\n00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's exactly where you need to check it.\n\n475\n00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.568\nSo you can go to your desktop and\nlook for the link there.\n\n476\n00:27:09.568 --> 00:27:12.270\nBut you wanna check in on the phone\nbecause that's where you want that link\n\n477\n00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.530\nto actually be clickable.\n\n478\n00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.241\nSo let's go back to the phone here.\n\n479\n00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:16.542\nAnd we'll try and see if we could do this.\n\n480\n00:27:16.542 --> 00:27:20.760\nAnd I went in and switched our gears\na little bit, went back to the phone.\n\n481\n00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.970\nAnd now I'm gonna select Mail and\nI have to do it on the phone here.\n\n482\n00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.650\nIt's a little bit more attractive.\n\n483\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:27.380\nAnd there you see it.\n\n484\n00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.600\nHere are the links for the Office mobile\napp, looks like I've got three of them.\n\n485\n00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.700\nSo that's probably because I actually\nclicked like three times here.\n\n486\n00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.850\nSo I'm just gonna select one of them.\n\n487\n00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:40.890\nAnd now if I scroll up,\nnotice it gives me these links here.\n\n488\n00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.290\nSo it says click on the icons below.\n\n489\n00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:43.890\n&gt;&gt; You got some options.\n\n490\n00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:48.140\n&gt;&gt; To download the Office apps that you\nwant for your phone or your tablet.\n\n491\n00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.680\nSo it gives me those options on which\none that I really want on this phone.\n\n492\n00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.620\nFrom that point if I select one,\nlet's see if I can select that one or.\n\n493\n00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.090\n&gt;&gt; This is just so interesting Ronnie.\n\n494\n00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:03.620\nIf you think about phones in general,\nand how they've kind of evolved.\n\n495\n00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.330\nAnd how you are putting\nPowerPoint on a mobile device.\n\n496\n00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.110\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there it is.\n\n497\n00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:11.110\nAnd you see what it really did is it\nled me back to the Google Play store,\n\n498\n00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.110\nis what it did.\n\n499\n00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.990\nSo it's simply a link, all those\nlinks they aggregated together, and\n\n500\n00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.070\nsaid here it is.\n\n501\n00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:21.339\nSo if somebody is not fairly familiar\nwith going into the Google Play store,\n\n502\n00:28:21.339 --> 00:28:24.554\nbut they can actually open up\nthe site on their computer.\n\n503\n00:28:24.554 --> 00:28:25.517\nWell they can do that.\n\n504\n00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:28.070\nAnd now I can click Open.\n\n505\n00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.180\nAnd there we go on my phone it's\nsaying hey do you want to allow\n\n506\n00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.930\naccess to these things?\n\n507\n00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:37.780\nSure I'll allow access to those,\nwell let me see gonna let me connect it.\n\n508\n00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.720\nAnd there it goes setting it up for\nthe very first time, all done.\n\n509\n00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.250\nAnd it may ask me to register back in.\n\n510\n00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.510\nIf it does so, we'll see.\n\n511\n00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.167\nContinue here.\n\n512\n00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:52.316\nSure, why not?\n\n513\n00:28:56.333 --> 00:29:00.560\nAnd we'll see here for a moment,\nnow it's asking me for the email address.\n\n514\n00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.590\nOnce again,\nthe ability to type here is the key.\n\n515\n00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:11.732\nofficeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n516\n00:29:11.732 --> 00:29:16.559\nI click Next, and it's connecting.\n\n517\n00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:18.776\nAnd now it's asking me for\nmy password here.\n\n518\n00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:24.260\nLet me not show it up there for right now.\n\n519\n00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:30.150\nThen this insanely long password,\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n520\n00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:30.850\n&gt;&gt; For me.\n\n521\n00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.650\n&gt;&gt; Not to mention your\ndomain is long as well.\n\n522\n00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:37.540\nSo it's kind of like just\ndouble trouble there Ronnie.\n\n523\n00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nnow it's fetching my files here.\n\n524\n00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.320\nSo, it's connecting into the Office\ncloud and it's getting ready for\n\n525\n00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.110\nthe usage that it needs to.\n\n526\n00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:49.160\nAnd notice that they're\nall my files ready to go\n\n527\n00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.050\neven on my mobile device\nwithout having to do much.\n\n528\n00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.390\nSo you can see where\nthis becomes very handy.\n\n529\n00:29:55.390 --> 00:30:00.428\nAnd if we now check, here's our last\nlittle incident here as we look at it.\n\n530\n00:30:00.428 --> 00:30:07.550\nLet's see if it actually changed\nup my licencing for my installs.\n\n531\n00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:10.040\nAnd if it does, it might take a moment or\ntwo but we'll see here.\n\n532\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.460\n&gt;&gt; To reflect that we have now\ninstalled on a mobile device.\n\n533\n00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.430\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it may, but it really doesn't.\n\n534\n00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:16.890\nSo you can actually see right there.\n\n535\n00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:20.780\nThere's nothing that's\nreally left there for us.\n\n536\n00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.400\nEverything is pretty much ready to go.\n\n537\n00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.830\nI'm just clicking on the install\nstatus one more time just to see.\n\n538\n00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.580\nAnd there it is still listed as two\ninstalls even though we still have that.\n\n539\n00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.475\n&gt;&gt; So it just might need\na few minutes to refresh.\n\n540\n00:30:31.475 --> 00:30:33.817\n&gt;&gt; It's either a few minutes or\nit might just say look,\n\n541\n00:30:33.817 --> 00:30:37.083\nthis is one of those mobile installs\nthat don't count towards the five.\n\n542\n00:30:37.083 --> 00:30:37.620\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n543\n00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.372\n&gt;&gt; So you just gotta realize that too.\n\n544\n00:30:39.372 --> 00:30:43.465\nBut that's something that at least get\nyou started inside of Office 365 and\n\n545\n00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:44.640\nthe apps here.\n\n546\n00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.550\nMake sure you take a look,\n\n547\n00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.870\nmake sure you try and\npractice this before you go in the exam.\n\n548\n00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:52.270\nMake sure you take a look around\nat these management features here.\n\n549\n00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.140\nThat's gonna be key for\nyour exam on deploying.\n\n550\n00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.350\nMy Office to your mobile devices too.\n\n551\n00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.830\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you, Ronnie, for\ncoming in and explaining that.\n\n552\n00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:04.550\nAnd, ladies and gentleman, thank you for\njoining us today as well, but stay tuned.\n\n553\n00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:06.410\nWe do have more

00:00:07.890\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.274\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.Tv.\n\n5\n00:00:10.274 --> 00:00:15.680\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your enabling\nOffice 365 Services Series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.770\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.510\nIn this episode,\nwe're kind of be shifting gears and\n\n8\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.800\nlooking at our client deployments\nfrom another perspective,\n\n9\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.260\nwe'll be looking at it from\nan IT management side of things.\n\n10\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.435\nAnd with us today we have Mister\nRonnie Long in studios, thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:31.376\njoining us Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:31.376 --> 00:00:35.497\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you ver, having me back\nhere as we continue to take a look at\n\n13\n00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:40.190\nthis aspect of office deployment in the\nvery first couple of shows that we did or\n\n14\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.270\nthe first couple of episodes\nthat we took a look at.\n\n15\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.190\nWe took a look at user driven deployments.\n\n16\n00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.360\nAnd that's where the user is in control.\n\n17\n00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.080\nWe can still do some overall things,\nright?\n\n18\n00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.730\nGlobally we can set it up to where we\ncan say hey don't install this and\n\n19\n00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.950\ndon't do this here.\n\n20\n00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.788\nBut now, taking it from the standpoint\n\n21\n00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:04.524\nof a more traditional approach\nwhere we can control everything.\n\n22\n00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:08.510\nWe can actually download\nthe deployment files itself.\n\n23\n00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.220\nWe can actually install it or\nchoose not to install it.\n\n24\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.243\nWe can do all that.\nWe can even use group policy to help us to\n\n25\n00:01:15.243 --> 00:01:19.210\nmanage the way that the office\ndeployments can go.\n\n26\n00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.411\nSo, this is probably more familiar for\nthose of you that have been the network,\n\n27\n00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:26.562\nthe system admins that were in\ncontrol of this deployment.\n\n28\n00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:30.835\nThis is probably more of what people\nreally do think about when they think\n\n29\n00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:34.630\nabout controlling the idea\nof deploying office here.\n\n30\n00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.280\nSo let's make sure that we\nunderstand that with Office 365,\n\n31\n00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.710\nsome of the, different ways that\nwe can manage deployment and\n\n32\n00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.540\nwhen it comes down theres\nreally three different options.\n\n33\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.040\nWe've already talked about one of them.\n\n34\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.730\nThat user driven deployment where\nessentially the user gets to download and\n\n35\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.537\ndirectly install Office from\nthe Office365 Cloud itself.\n\n36\n00:01:57.537 --> 00:01:58.050\nRight?\n\n37\n00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.650\nWhen we start to take a look at that,\n\n38\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.980\nthe only thing that we really have\nto ensure as the IT department side,\n\n39\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.990\nright, is that the user understands his\nlimitation of the number of licenses that\n\n40\n00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.830\nhe's going to have access to, and what\nhappens when he over, when he says, hey,\n\n41\n00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.360\nI need it on this many devices,\nit's telling me I don't have enough.\n\n42\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.906\nI still need it.\n\n43\n00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:21.701\nYou have to kinda let them know that,\nhey, this is the limitation of this and\n\n44\n00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:23.110\nthat's all that there is going to be.\n\n45\n00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.320\nYou also may have to help the user\nfigure out where to download this from.\n\n46\n00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.830\nThis is normally not that difficult since\nthe majority of times they are going to\n\n47\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.970\nhave a button in the upper-right\nhand corner that says install\n\n48\n00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.340\nOffice right here.\n\n49\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.370\nSo, it shouldn't be that difficult.\n\n50\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.580\nBut you never know.\n\n51\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.660\nAn end user may get confused.\n\n52\n00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.030\nSo you may have to actually\nlet them know exactly\n\n53\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.640\nwhere to go to get that\nparticular download and install.\n\n54\n00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.810\nSo that is one of the ways.\n\n55\n00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.080\nBut at least from the IT management point,\nokay?\n\n56\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.820\nWe can limit, like I said, the global\ninstallation features such as whether we\n\n57\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.380\nwant them to install it at all, or whether\nwe want to manage that installment itself.\n\n58\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.290\nNow if we choose, look,\n\n59\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.450\nwhat we're going to do is we're\nnot going to do it that way.\n\n60\n00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.800\nWe're not gonna allow\nend users to install it.\n\n61\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.180\nWell then, you and\n\n62\n00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.740\nI instead can download the installation\nfiles to a central share from that\n\n63\n00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.360\npoint we can manage the installation\nfeature manually if we choose to.\n\n64\n00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.460\nNow, this is a type that we're going to be\ndemonstrating in this particular series,\n\n65\n00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.460\nbecause it actually takes the least\namount of setup for us to do for\n\n66\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.390\nthe series that we're doing.\n\n67\n00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.450\nBut, there's a third option, and like I\nsaid, we're gonna spend more time, so\n\n68\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.170\nthat's why I'm not taking the time\nto go into full description here.\n\n69\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.550\nBut of course, the other option is if you\nalready have a current infrastructure\n\n70\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.110\nsetup where you're using something like\nsystem center configuration manager.\n\n71\n00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.700\nYou of course can use system\ncenter configuration manager,\n\n72\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.340\nto do the deployment itself too.\n\n73\n00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.120\nNow there's a particular tool\nthat we use called the ODT,\n\n74\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.960\nthat's what you'll normally hear it as.\n\n75\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.000\nThree letters O, D, and T.\n\n76\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.280\nStands for the Office Deployment Tool,\nthat will help you\n\n77\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.320\nto at least get the installation files\nto the central sharer that you want.\n\n78\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.540\nAnd that's really that's kind of where the\ncommonality between the manual deployment\n\n79\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.700\nand using systems center comes in.\n\n80\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.810\nBut besides that though,\nonce you get that,\n\n81\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.650\nthen you follow all the instruction\ninside the system center\n\n82\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.030\nto manage your deployments throughout\nyour organization, wherever it might be.\n\n83\n00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.000\nWith the manual deployment option though,\n\n84\n00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.780\nit is downloading everything\nto a centralized share, and\n\n85\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.425\nthen requiring the running of,\nwell a couple of different commands.\n\n86\n00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:40.615\nThat we're going to be showing you too.\n\n87\n00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:41.450\nOkay?\n\n88\n00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.260\nSo that is a part of the features that\nwe also have to think about, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.160\nSo that's the one that we're\ngoing to spend time on.\n\n90\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.450\nNow the other part of management that\nwe also have to think about of course\n\n91\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.400\nis going to be Office updates, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.890\nNow, inside of Office365,\nwhen we start talking about updates here,\n\n93\n00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.050\nit does update differently\nthan the way that previous\n\n94\n00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.290\nprograms used to update before\nthe Office365 types of installation.\n\n95\n00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.760\nAnd what I mean by that is, if you kind\nof remembered in Office 2013 and in\n\n96\n00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.060\nprevious editions, it really went through\nthe Windows Updating Service, right?\n\n97\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.070\nSo, if you actually were connected and\nyou had automatic updates turned on,\n\n98\n00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.740\nyour Office products would also\nfollow the automatic update features.\n\n99\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.160\nAnd would get updated in\nthat same fashion using,\n\n100\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.230\nof course, the Windows updates or the\nWindows Server Update services as well.\n\n101\n00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.836\nAnd even the SECM to download and\ndo everything that we want it to.\n\n102\n00:05:47.836 --> 00:05:50.011\nBut with Office 365, though,\n\n103\n00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:54.664\nit is a streaming update that when you\nare connected to the Internet It will\n\n104\n00:05:54.664 --> 00:05:59.317\nactually give us that ability to\ndownload those updates directly without\n\n105\n00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:04.550\nus having to worry about maintaining\nan update service if we choose to.\n\n106\n00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.120\nSo, we have to consider that when we start\nthinking about the idea of updating it.\n\n107\n00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.100\nThe reason is that if you're\nusing Office 365 you probably\n\n108\n00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.740\ndownloaded the Office\n365 Pro Plus edition.\n\n109\n00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.520\nAnd if you're in the Pro Plus\nedition it means you're not going to\n\n110\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.880\nget those updates through\nautomatic updates.\n\n111\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.080\nSo you can't depend on automatic updates\nto provide those if you need to.\n\n112\n00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.340\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie,\nif you're telling me that I can't depend\n\n113\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.360\non utilizing the Windows Update\nprocess to obtain these updates,\n\n114\n00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.000\nhow do I go ahead and retrieve them?\n\n115\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.340\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthis is where it becomes kind of fancy and\n\n116\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.720\ntricky, but simple at the same time.\n\n117\n00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.630\nAnd that's because they've tried to\nautomate everything to make it easier for\n\n118\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.830\nthe end user to begin to do this.\n\n119\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.050\nSo let me see if I can pull up a diagram\nhere to help us out, just a little bit.\n\n120\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.150\nHere let me pull up the right diagram,\nhow is that?\n\n121\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.800\nThat would actually help quite a bit if\nI actually pulled up the correct diagram\n\n122\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.220\nto help us to take a look\nat the management features.\n\n123\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.800\nAnd what,\nif it actually comes in there we go.\n\n124\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.490\nAnd this will help us out too, all right.\n\n125\n00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.340\nNow, the traditional deployment methods\nthat we've been talking about in the past,\n\n126\n00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.250\nan individual user of course\nhas either deploy Office.\n\n127\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.680\nThey can do so idividually directly\nfrom the Office 365 Portal.\n\n128\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.990\nAnd that's pretty much the way\nthat we had been discussing\n\n129\n00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.230\nthe traditional of Deployments\nall Office to do that.\n\n130\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.710\nAnd that's a user driven Deployment right?\n\n131\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.370\nThey click on the link,\nthey download it and\n\n132\n00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.050\nthat's pretty much all\nthat they have to do.\n\n133\n00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.140\nOnce they do that, the updates\nare automatically scheduled for them.\n\n134\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.640\nYou don't normally have to\nthink about them really at all.\n\n135\n00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.660\nIt's just going to happen\nwhenever they normally happen.\n\n136\n00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.560\nWe'll talk about that\nscheduling in just a moment.\n\n137\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.280\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n138\n00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.336\n&gt;&gt; But in Office 365, if now in your\norganization, you might find out That\n\n139\n00:07:59.336 --> 00:08:04.570\nthere is a couple of different things\nthat you have to pay attention to right?\n\n140\n00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.146\nSo Cherokee let's take for an example,\n\n141\n00:08:07.146 --> 00:08:11.541\nhave you ever updated a product on\nlet's say a client's computer and\n\n142\n00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:16.516\nall of the sudden another product ended\nup breaking where it wouldn't work.\n\n143\n00:08:16.516 --> 00:08:17.427\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n144\n00:08:17.427 --> 00:08:20.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So something like that right?\n\n145\n00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.570\nWell we don't want something like\nthat to happen in our organization.\n\n146\n00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.860\nBecause downtime is very important,\nand then we have to try and\n\n147\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.340\nisolate what update or\n\n148\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.280\nwhat ended up happening, that ended up\nbreaking another product on my computer.\n\n149\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.860\n&gt;&gt; So you can roll it back and at least\nkind of just patch things together,\n\n150\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.750\nband aid them until we could\nfind the permanent solution.\n\n151\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Office 365 said look,\nwe know that there are some people,\n\n152\n00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.850\nright, the people at home,\nis probably not gonna interfere with\n\n153\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.260\nmost of the programs that\nthey run on their computers.\n\n154\n00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.440\nBut the very fact is your organization\nthough may run a special line of\n\n155\n00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.280\nbusiness app or\nmay have different macros or\n\n156\n00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.530\nscripts that end up running In\nwhich the Office 365 update,\n\n157\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:05.280\nif it happens at its normal periods here,\ncould cause issues with.\n\n158\n00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, especially if like you said,\nline of business.\n\n159\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.800\nMeaning it's detrimental to\nthe function of my organization.\n\n160\n00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so in that sense, when you have\nsomething like that, they're saying look.\n\n161\n00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.200\nWe're gonna kind of change the way\nthat updating essentially happens\n\n162\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.740\nwe're not gonna allow for\nthe automatic updates, necessarily.\n\n163\n00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.020\nBut we do want to allow for\nupdating to happen.\n\n164\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.670\nAnd it should be a continuous\ncycle of updates, as well.\n\n165\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.610\nSo that sounds strange, doesn't it?\n\n166\n00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.120\nSo let me kind of give\nyou an instance here.\n\n167\n00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.960\nA lot of times,\nwhen your computers update.\n\n168\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.937\nThey are normally not fixing things as\nmuch as they are providing a security\n\n169\n00:09:41.937 --> 00:09:46.927\nfix at times or they're providing\nsome type of performance enhancement.\n\n170\n00:09:46.927 --> 00:09:51.804\nBad code with change whatever might be but\nusually when something breaks it's because\n\n171\n00:09:51.804 --> 00:09:54.608\nit decided this was broken\nbefore let's try and\n\n172\n00:09:54.608 --> 00:09:59.120\nfix this and they didn't realize\nwhat else it would cause damage to.\n\n173\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.210\nSo now when they actually push out things,\n\n174\n00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.970\nthey happen differently in terms of\nthe way that the updates end up happening.\n\n175\n00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.340\nSo we're gonna see that in terms of\nthe cycles that we're talking about\n\n176\n00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.200\nwhen we start to take a look\nat the updates here, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.490\nSo let's go ahead and talk about the way\nthat updates also happen as well.\n\n178\n00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:23.730\nOkay, when you run Office, if we just\ntake a regular standard deployment of\n\n179\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:29.320\nrunning Office here, right, our computers\ndownload it and here we go, okay.\n\n180\n00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.230\nIt happens twice in a scheduled\naspect of the way that your\n\n181\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.480\ncomputer runs and that means it\nactually creates two scheduled tasks.\n\n182\n00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.190\nWhen you install Office 365\nPro Plus onto the computer\n\n183\n00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.620\nit's gonna create two schedule tasks,\n\n184\n00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:50.220\none at every login and then once a week\nis what it'll actually end up doing.\n\n185\n00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:55.670\nSo every time you login,\nOffice 365, your Office products\n\n186\n00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:00.502\nwill essentially check and say hey\nare there any updates available, okay?\n\n187\n00:11:00.502 --> 00:11:05.100\nIf there's not an update available\nat that point, then it just goes,\n\n188\n00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.910\nall right, no update available.\n\n189\n00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.630\nAnd then, it waits for the weekly check.\n\n190\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:15.150\nAt the weekly check, if there are updates\navailable, it will apply them\n\n191\n00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:21.380\nduring that particular time period that\nthe weekly schedule checks as apply them.\n\n192\n00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.639\nNow it also holds back if Cherokee is\nin the middle of working on a product.\n\n193\n00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:28.951\nLet's say that she's using Word,\n\n194\n00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:34.020\nMicrosoft Word to type something out\nas she is working on a document.\n\n195\n00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.875\nAnd let's say is a weekly\ncheck at this point.\n\n196\n00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:40.280\nThe weekly check comes on and\ngoes there's an update available.\n\n197\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.447\nIt can notify Cherokee that\nthere's an update available but\n\n198\n00:11:43.447 --> 00:11:46.950\nCherokee does not necessarily\nhave to stop working.\n\n199\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.000\n&gt;&gt; How thoughtful.\n\n200\n00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, yeah, how thoughtful of\nit but what it will do is, it'll go, yeah.\n\n201\n00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.700\nThere's an update available and\n\n202\n00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.760\nthen it will either wait for\nCherokee to log back in or\n\n203\n00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.940\nit will wait until the next update\ntime before it actually updates.\n\n204\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.740\nSo if Cherokee is using it and it normally\nrequires the restart of something,\n\n205\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.450\nwell then it will wait until that point\nbefore it actually applies anything.\n\n206\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.670\nSo it's a smarter update path or\n\n207\n00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.860\na feature in the way that\nends up doing that as well.\n\n208\n00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.500\nOkay, the other thing also that\nends up happening in the way that\n\n209\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:28.150\nMicrosoft has chosen to keep\nOffice up to date is also neat.\n\n210\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.960\nAnd we're talking about during out breaks\nhere in our chat room a little bit there\n\n211\n00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:39.655\nare people in our chat as you saw\nCherokee saying that what is Word 1.0 and\n\n212\n00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:44.470\n6 Excel Version 6 and 97 and 2000.\n\n213\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.130\nYou name all those different versions,\nright?\n\n214\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.440\nThose were great products, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.649\nAnd I remember pretty much using\n97 all the way up into 2016 now.\n\n216\n00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:59.050\nSo all of those are great products.\n\n217\n00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.530\nBut their updates, they kind of came\nalong when they came along, right?\n\n218\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.360\nSo, either you go, okay,\nlet me run my automatic updates.\n\n219\n00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.890\nYou might get one every once in awhile, or\n\n220\n00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.500\nall of a sudden, everything would update\nat one time, or whatever it might be.\n\n221\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.390\nBut it wasn't very regular at its update.\n\n222\n00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.935\nSo, it could be that you had\na program that was on your computer,\n\n223\n00:13:19.935 --> 00:13:24.720\nan Office product that may not\nhave been updated for six months.\n\n224\n00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.270\nOkay, it's very possible.\n\n225\n00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.810\nYou may have another one that\nupdated every other month.\n\n226\n00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.230\nBecause there were so\nmany vulnerabilities to it.\n\n227\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.660\nSo you never knew if everything\nwas actually in sync or\n\n228\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.580\nin the right version of\nwhat it needed to be in.\n\n229\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.034\nThe way that Office 365 works\nin this updating process,\n\n230\n00:13:40.034 --> 00:13:45.560\nis it follows the same schedule as\nthe Super Tuesday updates, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.150\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n232\n00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.640\n&gt;&gt; So what ends up happening, which is\nneat, at least from my perspective here,\n\n233\n00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.150\nis neat is that whenever we are now\nmonitoring cuz we always are, right?\n\n234\n00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.131\nWe're looking for those Super Tuesday\nupdates, see what's changed and\n\n235\n00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:00.167\nwhat we need to do.\n\n236\n00:14:00.167 --> 00:14:04.927\nWell, every Super Tuesday Office\n365 gets updated,\n\n237\n00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:09.640\nthe complete Office suite itself,\ngets updated.\n\n238\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you normally wouldn't\nworry about looking for\n\n239\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.410\nany updates unless something wasn't\nworking, at least that was my experience.\n\n240\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, it makes a good point for\nus, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.430\nThe very fact our people do what,\nas an individual.\n\n242\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.080\nIf you're working,\n\n243\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.820\nyou might go, I'm in the middle of\nworking, I don't want to update.\n\n244\n00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.550\nThen it comes back two days later,\nyou're still in the middle of working?\n\n245\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.480\nWhat do you do?\n&gt;&gt; Postpone again.\n\n246\n00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.340\n&gt;&gt; You keep postponing.\n\n247\n00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.380\nAnd all the sudden,\nyou're still working, you postpone it.\n\n248\n00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.900\nYou keep postponing and now,\nall of the sudden, it's a month later and\n\n249\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.810\nnow you've postponed that update.\n\n250\n00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.270\nWell what Office is saying is\nthat's fine if you do that.\n\n251\n00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.640\nBut what they're saying\nalso is at the same time\n\n252\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.500\nis that every month\nessentially it's gonna have,\n\n253\n00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.930\nit's gonna be a new, brand new Office\nproduct that you're essentially getting.\n\n254\n00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:01.110\nSo when you actually download from Office\nitself, regardless of when it is, right?\n\n255\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:05.510\nWhen you download it and\nyou happen to download it this month or\n\n256\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.760\nnext month, you're not getting\nit like if it's next month.\n\n257\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.810\nFor us that would be May, I think.\n\n258\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.190\nIf you're downloading it in May,\n\n259\n00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.150\nyou're not getting April's\nedition of Office, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.200\nYou're not getting January's\nedition of Office.\n\n261\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.270\nYou're not getting October 2016's\n\n262\n00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.110\nedition of Office that you're\ngetting when you download it.\n\n263\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.693\nYou're getting what?\n\n264\n00:15:25.693 --> 00:15:30.290\nYou're getting that latest and\nmost current edition that you have.\n\n265\n00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.270\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n266\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.168\n&gt;&gt; And the reason why that's important,\n\n267\n00:15:33.168 --> 00:15:39.040\nokay is because every update that happens\nis gonna be based on that newest version.\n\n268\n00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.330\nSo then it does a differential check.\n\n269\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.200\nIt takes a look at when you updated\nyour computer, and it takes a look at\n\n270\n00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.370\nthe newest version and it says, hey-\n&gt;&gt; What has been changed?\n\n271\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.340\n&gt;&gt; What's been changed?\n\n272\n00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.576\nAnd then it only has to download\nthe difference between those.\n\n273\n00:15:53.576 --> 00:15:57.087\nAnd instead of you going okay, here's the\nincremental update that you have to update\n\n274\n00:15:57.087 --> 00:15:58.756\nbefore you can actually update to this.\n\n275\n00:15:58.756 --> 00:15:59.508\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n276\n00:15:59.508 --> 00:16:00.133\n&gt;&gt; Like service packs.\n\n277\n00:16:00.133 --> 00:16:02.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like service packs,\nthat can end up happening.\n\n278\n00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.109\nYeah, those types of things, it just says\nthat this is gonna be the latest addition.\n\n279\n00:16:06.109 --> 00:16:11.069\nSo that is really neat and nice because\nit means that as new people get hired in.\n\n280\n00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:16.080\nCherokee as being the desktop support or\nthat the network technician that's doing\n\n281\n00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:21.310\nthe deployment, she's like yeah that's\nright, we have to install this.\n\n282\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.713\nAnd then we have to wait six hours for\nthese updates to happen.\n\n283\n00:16:24.713 --> 00:16:26.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then that's right,\n\n284\n00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.860\nthere's gonna be second round\nof that that's gonna go on.\n\n285\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.310\n&gt;&gt; Those were the days, especially\nXP with all their extra rollups for\n\n286\n00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.677\nthe media center addition,\nnow it's just fun.\n\n287\n00:16:33.677 --> 00:16:36.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so all of those things that end\n\n288\n00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:41.220\nup applying, right, is what will end up\nhappening here in terms of the updates and\n\n289\n00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.290\nthe features that end up going on.\n\n290\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.020\nThat is really good, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.830\nIt really is a modern approach and\n\n292\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.180\nmaking sure that what we're doing is\nwe're not holding on for service packs.\n\n293\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.820\nAnd we're not waiting for\nthat every single Tuesday that we get.\n\n294\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.180\nIt will pretty much be the newest\nedition that will be out there, and\n\n295\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:05.100\nthen only needs to detect what the\ndifference is and we only download those.\n\n296\n00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.810\nSo the great thing is if you do it for\nthis month right,\n\n297\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:13.070\nfor when we are right now,\nyou just download the updates for that.\n\n298\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:15.610\nNext month you're not\nactually on your computer,\n\n299\n00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:21.620\nat least you're not trying to download\nfrom October of 2016 like I said.\n\n300\n00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.470\nYou're only downloading\nfrom what's different from\n\n301\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.700\nlast month is what you're ending up doing.\n\n302\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.980\nSo, the update should be faster, should be\nquicker, but should be on a more regular\n\n303\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.220\ndeployment, which is what we normally\nwant to happen as well, okay?\n\n304\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz we all love those logging\ninto your system and waiting and\n\n305\n00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.285\nwaiting and waiting before\nyou can actually do anything.\n\n306\n00:17:39.285 --> 00:17:42.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's always key in that sense.\n\n307\n00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.731\nNow, there's also of course in the IT\nworld then, managing these types\n\n308\n00:17:47.731 --> 00:17:53.420\nof deployments may actually be where go\nwhoa, whoa, whoa wait a minute Ronnie.\n\n309\n00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.275\nWhat if I need to test\nall this stuff out but\n\n310\n00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:58.500\nit's coming out faster than I\ncan actually get those tests?\n\n311\n00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.030\nWell what you can do is you then,\nas the manager,\n\n312\n00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:07.940\nas the IT administrator, you can go in and\nchange the deployment schedule\n\n313\n00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.230\nof even your updates during\nyour deployment, okay?\n\n314\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.890\nSo you don't always have to\nfollow exactly this and say,\n\n315\n00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.000\nautomatic updates is gonna happen\nevery month, it's gonna do that.\n\n316\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.860\nBut they give you three different options\nthat you can use instead to be able to do\n\n317\n00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.590\nsomething like this and to choose what\nyou actually want to be able to choose.\n\n318\n00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.230\nAnd these are also what we call\ndifferent types of deployment channels\n\n319\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.110\nthat we can get access to as well, okay.\n\n320\n00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:40.332\nSo, when we start to do this\nidea of a manual deployment,\n\n321\n00:18:40.332 --> 00:18:43.370\nthere's a couple of things that you need\nto do and then we're gonna talk about\n\n322\n00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.590\nthe update process as we go through and\nshow you this too, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.380\nSo we start talking about\nmanually deploying Office,\n\n324\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.440\nlet's see where we go and do that.\n\n325\n00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:57.120\nRight so let me switch back over to my\nclient here we are in Joey's computer.\n\n326\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.780\nIf I click on Admin.\n\n327\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.404\nAnd then once the admin portal comes up,\nover on the left hand side where\n\n328\n00:19:07.404 --> 00:19:11.620\nI'll get the navigation to all\nthe admin if it ever comes in.\n\n329\n00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.930\nWell maybe, it looks like it's kind\nof hung on me a little bit here.\n\n330\n00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:21.040\nLet me see if I can click on it again,\nmaybe it will come in this time.\n\n331\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.370\nThere we go.\n\n332\n00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.258\nThere's the black bar.\n\n333\n00:19:23.258 --> 00:19:24.274\nI got it there.\n\n334\n00:19:24.274 --> 00:19:25.469\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Finally, like,\n\n335\n00:19:25.469 --> 00:19:26.563\nI'm starting to doubt here.\n\n336\n00:19:26.563 --> 00:19:30.192\nWhat we are taking a look\nat is over here and\n\n337\n00:19:30.192 --> 00:19:35.910\nI am gonna select the gear which\nis also the link for the settings.\n\n338\n00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:42.334\nGo into Service &amp; add-ins and within\nService &amp; add-ins, I am gonna scroll\n\n339\n00:19:42.334 --> 00:19:47.150\ndown to make sure that we get everything\nset up for a manual deployment.\n\n340\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:52.830\nSo I'm gonna select Office\nsoftware downloads settings.\n\n341\n00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.850\nMake sure we can see that,\nOffice software download settings.\n\n342\n00:20:01.612 --> 00:20:04.817\nAnd there's a couple warnings that\nwe need to make sure that we pay\n\n343\n00:20:04.817 --> 00:20:05.940\nattention to, okay?\n\n344\n00:20:08.578 --> 00:20:13.280\nAnd here is the paragraph, okay, that we\nwanna make sure that we pay attention to.\n\n345\n00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.382\nIf you do not want your user to\ninstall software themselves, okay?\n\n346\n00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n347\n00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.770\n&gt;&gt; Turn off all options and\n\n348\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:25.750\nthen select Manually deploy user software,\nokay?\n\n349\n00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.150\nAnd that link is right here.\n\n350\n00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.750\nSo if we wanted to do this\n\n351\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:36.370\nwe essentially turn off the 2016\nversion for Mac and for Office.\n\n352\n00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.319\nAnd I'm gonna verify that and click Save.\n\n353\n00:20:41.696 --> 00:20:45.750\nAnd then I'm gonna select this link again.\n\n354\n00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:50.280\nAnd now I can select Manually\ndeploy user software.\n\n355\n00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:55.440\nAnd that's gonna give me this right here,\nokay?\n\n356\n00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.475\nChoose which software your\nusers can download and\n\n357\n00:20:58.475 --> 00:21:00.868\ndirectly install from Office 365.\n\n358\n00:21:00.868 --> 00:21:06.159\nSo, it's here that I would\nturn these options on where\n\n359\n00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:10.888\nI might say,\nI want the 2016 version for PC.\n\n360\n00:21:10.888 --> 00:21:15.575\nBut I really don't care about making\nsure that SharePoint designer and\n\n361\n00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:18.543\neven the Skype for\nBusiness stand alone app is\n\n362\n00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:23.480\nthere because this Office 365 is\ngonna include the Skype for Business.\n\n363\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.820\nNotice here are two channels, okay?\n\n364\n00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.910\nThen there's actually three and\n\n365\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.550\nwe're gonna talk about all\nthree here in just a moment.\n\n366\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:38.110\nBut overall though, how often do you want\nyour user to get feature updates and\n\n367\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.020\nthis is key here,\nwhere it says feature updates.\n\n368\n00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.510\nThis is not the same as the security\nupdate, it's not the same as performance\n\n369\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.390\nupdates here, a feature update means\nthat they've improved something, okay?\n\n370\n00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.500\nSo how often do you\nwant these to come out?\n\n371\n00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.530\nWell it really depends on you.\n\n372\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.970\nMost end users.\n\n373\n00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.470\n&gt;&gt; It's not as eminent or\nas serious as a security update so\n\n374\n00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.770\nI could see the option of moving and\nbumping it back a little bit.\n\n375\n00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.100\n&gt;&gt; So it's right here where you\ncan say I want every single month.\n\n376\n00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.830\nAs new features come out I want to do\nthat but if you're an organization and\n\n377\n00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.620\nyou're worried that it's going to break.\n\n378\n00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.028\nWell, breaking stuff every month\nthat might mean more of a challenge.\n\n379\n00:22:16.028 --> 00:22:22.440\nThat's a ton of work here, but notice you\nhave this, every 4 months here, okay.\n\n380\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.900\nNow if we choose these\njust fine you can do that.\n\n381\n00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.320\nRemember it is a possibility you are gonna\nactually be behind the eight bar\n\n382\n00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.390\nmore often than you think, okay.\n\n383\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.620\nBecause you're really wondering.\n\n384\n00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.280\nAnd you have to go and\n\n385\n00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.800\ntest out every line of business app to\nmake sure that it's not breaking anything.\n\n386\n00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.992\nYou're gonna have to do that once a month.\n\n387\n00:22:42.992 --> 00:22:43.530\nIt's pretty harsh.\n\n388\n00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.328\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 12 times a year.\n\n389\n00:22:44.328 --> 00:22:44.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:45.940\n&gt;&gt; That's if, if it doesn't\n\n391\n00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.030\nbreak anything you have to check\nit at least 12 times a year.\n\n392\n00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n393\n00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.590\n&gt;&gt; So now every 4 months.\n\n394\n00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.640\nWell notice that now just becomes,\nhow many times a year is that now?\n\n395\n00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.946\nLet's see if we can test\nCherokee's math ability now.\n\n396\n00:22:56.946 --> 00:22:59.322\n&gt;&gt; You're asking me the hard\nquestions here, Ronnie.\n\n397\n00:22:59.322 --> 00:23:01.318\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now three times a year, how's that?\n\n398\n00:23:01.318 --> 00:23:01.818\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:23:01.818 --> 00:23:03.366\n&gt;&gt; Three times four, that's 12, right?\n\n400\n00:23:03.366 --> 00:23:04.680\nYeah, see there you go.\n\n401\n00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.310\nSo the deferred channel says, look,\n\n402\n00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:11.490\nevery 4 months instead,\nbring these updates out, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.670\nNow, these updates, again, we'll\nactually still have security updates and\n\n404\n00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:21.670\nsome performance updates that will\nstill come out every login or\n\n405\n00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.290\nevery time,\nevery weekly thing that we get.\n\n406\n00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.535\nIt'll do that but anything that's a new\nfeature, that could potentially break.\n\n407\n00:23:27.535 --> 00:23:28.890\n&gt;&gt; Non-essential.\n\n408\n00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.810\n&gt;&gt; What we're gonna do,\nis kind of defer that every 4 months.\n\n409\n00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:33.940\nWell, why is that important?\n\n410\n00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.344\nBecause it gives that ability then to say,\nall right,\n\n411\n00:23:37.344 --> 00:23:40.608\nI want to test out some of\nthese updates here, okay?\n\n412\n00:23:40.608 --> 00:23:43.646\nAnd we're gonna talk about update\nchannels, and it looks like since I'm\n\n413\n00:23:43.646 --> 00:23:46.296\nrunning out of time here,\nin our next particular episode here.\n\n414\n00:23:46.296 --> 00:23:51.404\nBut every four months instead and\nthat will give me the chance to do this,\n\n415\n00:23:51.404 --> 00:23:56.514\nthat I can download them right,\nthis kind of deferred update that we're\n\n416\n00:23:56.514 --> 00:24:01.623\ngonna actually see here, test them out\nbefore I actually push them out So\n\n417\n00:24:01.623 --> 00:24:06.395\nI might actually be able to create\na group that allows me to test it and\n\n418\n00:24:06.395 --> 00:24:09.747\nthen during that next\ncycle test everything and\n\n419\n00:24:09.747 --> 00:24:14.120\nthen push out my own updates\ninstead if I choose too.\n\n420\n00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.510\nSo, that will allow me to do that instead\nof having to do it every month as well.\n\n421\n00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:22.940\nAnd then of course you can choose you want\nthe Office 2016 version to be there or\n\n422\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.430\nnot, well now you have that ability,\nand you say,\n\n423\n00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.610\nall right,\nthis is what we want to be able to deploy.\n\n424\n00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.220\n&gt;&gt; Which is a nice option.\n\n425\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.720\nLike you had mentioned before, Ronnie,\n\n426\n00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.570\nif you don't even have any kind\nof MacIntosh or Mac systems in\n\n427\n00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:41.260\nyour environment then you really wouldn't\neven need to have that option available.\n\n428\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.010\n&gt;&gt; That is true, so,\n\n429\n00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:46.230\nand we just used that, we can actually\nmake sure that that goes away as well.\n\n430\n00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.890\nSo now, this computer is ready,\nand we're not gonna set it up for\n\n431\n00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:53.000\nthe automatic updates\nto go along with this.\n\n432\n00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.200\nSo, once we get this set up for the manual\ndeployment, what should happen now\n\n433\n00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:03.331\nis that we wont be kind of setting up\nthat unusual schedule for updates here.\n\n434\n00:25:03.331 --> 00:25:06.855\nWe're gonna actually choose the way that\nit's gonna update whether it's actually\n\n435\n00:25:06.855 --> 00:25:09.450\ngonna be the every four months,\nor every month here.\n\n436\n00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:13.560\nBut there's also another option that's\ncalled diverse release deferred\n\n437\n00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.110\ncycle as well or channel that we're\nalso gonna end up seeing here too.\n\n438\n00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:22.830\nNow the other thing is now that, that's\ndone, there's one other process that we\n\n439\n00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:29.220\nneed to at least talk about before we head\ninto our second episode as well, okay.\n\n440\n00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:37.087\nThis all depends on using something that\nwe call the Office Deployment Tool okay.\n\n441\n00:25:37.087 --> 00:25:41.739\nThere's two versions of this, there's\na 2013 version, there's a 2016 version.\n\n442\n00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:46.772\nBecause now that the Office 2013\nhas no longer been supported,\n\n443\n00:25:46.772 --> 00:25:51.550\nthis will actually do both,\nand will do 2013 and 2016.\n\n444\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.723\nAnd I think it also does both,\nwhether it's 32-bit or 64-bit,\n\n445\n00:25:55.723 --> 00:25:57.290\nif I remember correctly.\n\n446\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:01.270\nSo I may be wrong on that one,\nbut I don't think I am.\n\n447\n00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.580\nSo this one actually gives you that.\n\n448\n00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:08.383\nYou download this,\nit's gonna come with a setup.exe and\n\n449\n00:26:08.383 --> 00:26:13.883\na single XML file that is\ngenerically named configuration.xml.\n\n450\n00:26:13.883 --> 00:26:17.390\nSo once you've downloaded this,\nit'd be a zipped up file for you.\n\n451\n00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:21.260\nAnd if you're looking at the link,\nIt will be included in the show notes.\n\n452\n00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.300\nYou'll actually see that link there.\n\n453\n00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.734\nI included it both for 2013 and 2016.\n\n454\n00:26:25.734 --> 00:26:30.522\nBut just kind of realize today you're\ngonna use the 2016 one if you want\n\n455\n00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:31.130\nto okay?\n\n456\n00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.740\nNow you do have to be careful here\nespecially on this deployment.\n\n457\n00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:41.120\nPeople have tried to use this with earlier\nwhat we call legacy versions of Office.\n\n458\n00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.054\nLike Office 2010 and 2007.\n\n459\n00:26:44.054 --> 00:26:46.730\nWell, it may work with Office 2010.\n\n460\n00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.670\nIt's not guaranteed, but it definitely\nis not gonna work with Office 2007.\n\n461\n00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.570\nSo just be aware of that feature too.\n\n462\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:59.560\nSo if you're gonna deploy this\nmanually like what we're gonna do.\n\n463\n00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.000\nThis is what you're gonna download.\n\n464\n00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.730\nAnd you're gonna also end up creating\n\n465\n00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:08.670\na central share that\neverybody can get access to.\n\n466\n00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.800\nAnd from that point we'll actually end\nup doing a download, not a download.\n\n467\n00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.200\nWe'll actually end up\ndoing a manual install and\n\n468\n00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.790\ntalk about the update features and\nwhat the different channels actually mean.\n\n469\n00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.210\nBut until that point I\nhave run out of time.\n\n470\n00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.300\nSo Cherokee, if you don't stop me,\nI'm gonna continue on with.\n\n471\n00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.615\nSo that's what's gonna end up happening.\n\n472\n00:27:28.615 --> 00:27:30.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nI'll go ahead and stop you now.\n\n473\n00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:34.070\nBut I can't wait until the next episode so\nwe can actually take a look and\n\n474\n00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.110\nsee how we can utilize\ndifferent deployment methods.\n\n475\n00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.280\nBut thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in.\n\n476\n00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.700\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n477\n00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.460\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n478\n00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.300\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n479\n00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.699\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n480\n00:27:46.699 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.740\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Enabling Office\n365 Services series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.640\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.870\nSo in this episode is a continuation of\na previous show where we were looking at\n\n7\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.390\nthe client's deployment from\nthe IT department management side.\n\n8\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.870\nSo with us today, we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in the studios.\n\n9\n00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.210\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\nas we continue to take a look at IT\n\n11\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.210\nmanagement of deploying well,\nMicrosoft Office, of course.\n\n12\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.170\nTo our Office 365 subscribers.\n\n13\n00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.910\nNow we've already taken a look\nat several different things.\n\n14\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.720\nAnd we were talking about, of course,\nnot only do we have to be able to get or\n\n15\n00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.820\nto be able to manage, right,\ndeploying Office to those users.\n\n16\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.764\nWe also of course have to\nmanage their updates too.\n\n17\n00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:58.300\nAnd we had talked about that\nidea of the update process and\n\n18\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.512\nwhat we can do globally inside of\nthe admin center in Office 365.\n\n19\n00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:06.392\nTo help us to control whether or not we\nwant them to get access to it that way or\n\n20\n00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:07.019\nwe don't.\n\n21\n00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:10.514\nOne last thing that we said is if\nwe're gonna do a manual deployment and\n\n22\n00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:11.825\nmanage it for ourselves.\n\n23\n00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:16.874\nAnd not allow for the Office 365\nsubscribers to just click on a button to\n\n24\n00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:22.261\ndo the install, well we have to turn those\nfeatures off and then we can move on.\n\n25\n00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:27.205\nLet me show you what I'm talking about\nas we get started back again for\n\n26\n00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:29.176\nthis particular episode.\n\n27\n00:01:29.176 --> 00:01:36.365\nSo if I go back into my Office 365\nportal that will allow me to log in.\n\n28\n00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:43.665\n&gt;&gt; You're logging in as Joey.\n\n29\n00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:44.523\n&gt;&gt; As Joey.\n\n30\n00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:53.673\nAnd I just have to be able to type in this\nlonger password here, which is the key.\n\n31\n00:01:53.673 --> 00:01:57.851\nSo now at this particular point\nas we get access back in.\n\n32\n00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:01.609\nFor us, if we were to control\nthat particular aspect of\n\n33\n00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.444\nlimiting the number of applications or\neven removing that from them.\n\n34\n00:02:06.444 --> 00:02:08.910\nWe wanna make sure we know\nwhere to go to do that.\n\n35\n00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.060\nI simply selected the Admin tile and\nthat brings me into the admin center.\n\n36\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.300\nOver here on the left-hand side,\nI'm gonna look for the little gear.\n\n37\n00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.180\nRemember that if your resolution is\nhigher, you'll probably see not only\n\n38\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.460\nthe gear but the word Settings beside it,\nand mine's actually quite low here.\n\n39\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.040\nSo I can display it so you can see it\nwithout having to squint too much.\n\n40\n00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.680\nSelect Services and add-in.\n\n41\n00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.990\nAnd once I get into Services and add-in\nas the Office 365 global administrator,\n\n42\n00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.120\nI scroll down and I select Office\nsoftware download settings.\n\n43\n00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.472\nAnd it's within this particular setting\nthen that I can come in here and\n\n44\n00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:49.532\nsimply just turn on or off.\n\n45\n00:02:49.532 --> 00:02:53.800\nIn other words, toggle on or\noff what I want users to get access to.\n\n46\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.465\nSo in this setting, the way that\nwe have it configured right now.\n\n47\n00:02:57.465 --> 00:03:01.670\nIs I have it where if you're\nrunning the software on a PC,\n\n48\n00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.680\nyou can download Office version 2016,\nthe entire Office Suite.\n\n49\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.828\nBut I've also excluded the downloading and\ninstallation of\n\n50\n00:03:10.828 --> 00:03:16.205\nSharePoint Designer as well as the Skype\nfor Business standalone client too.\n\n51\n00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:20.405\nThe other thing that I've also done\nis selected the current channel for\n\n52\n00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:24.537\nthe updates to also occur if we chose\nto do something like this, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:30.187\nAnd then of course from here,\n2011 as well, and or 2016.\n\n54\n00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:32.852\nIf I wanted to make sure that\nthey didn't have access to that,\n\n55\n00:03:32.852 --> 00:03:36.430\nwe simply can uncheck that, and\nwe would go ahead and click Save.\n\n56\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.890\nSo that was one of the features.\n\n57\n00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.320\nNow notice that up here at the top,\nwhich is also something else we emphasize.\n\n58\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.240\nIf you want to choose to do this manually,\n\n59\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.350\nnotice it gives us an option where it\nsays this is what you need to do, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.750\nWhich is if you don't want users to\ninstall the software themselves,\n\n61\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.390\nturn off all the options, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.490\nAnd then you simply select this.\n\n63\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.066\nSo their recommendation of course\nthen is we simply go ahead and\n\n64\n00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:06.592\nturn off all these options, and you'll\nsee it actually will do this for us too.\n\n65\n00:04:06.592 --> 00:04:13.715\nSo once we select that, then we can\nclick Manually deploy user software.\n\n66\n00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:17.491\nAnd it's right here where it really\ngives us that same list again, but\n\n67\n00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:20.290\nnow just a little bit\nmore in this setting.\n\n68\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.780\nWhere it says for me to choose how users\ncan download and directly install.\n\n69\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.350\nFrom that point, it proceeds a little\nbit further which says right here,\n\n70\n00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.860\nManually deploy user software.\n\n71\n00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.330\nNow if we want something like that,\nwe'll also have to go ahead and\n\n72\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.040\nbe able to download another utility which\nwe call the Office Deployment Tool.\n\n73\n00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.530\nAnd there is couple of links that\nyou'll have inside the show notes\n\n74\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.700\nthat will show you where you can go and\ndownload that.\n\n75\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.820\nAnd you'll get that ready to go, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.434\nNow once you download that,\n\n77\n00:04:50.434 --> 00:04:53.534\nthe great thing is all you\nneed is a centralized share.\n\n78\n00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:58.564\nAnd then you put that download directly in\nthat centralized share and you unzip it.\n\n79\n00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:03.826\nAnd once you actually unzip everything\nfrom there, it will give you access\n\n80\n00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:10.050\nto the tools that are actually available\nfor us to do this manual deployment.\n\n81\n00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.990\nSo let me go ahead and\nbrowse into that for\n\n82\n00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.490\nus as we really get to this\nprocess here of doing this.\n\n83\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.350\nSo if I select Local Disk (C:) and\n\n84\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.040\nI've created, I'm actually on\nthe wrong computer, aren't I?\n\n85\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.440\nYep, so let me go back to DC01 here where\nI created this share and downloaded to it.\n\n86\n00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.520\nWe'll go back and\nwe'll make that creation.\n\n87\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.710\nOffice 365, or\nO365 here is the share I created.\n\n88\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.640\nAnd once you actually download that and\nyou unzip it,\n\n89\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.990\nit's gonna create this file for you.\n\n90\n00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.214\nWhich is actually just a setup.exe file,\nand\n\n91\n00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:44.937\nby default it will create a file\ncalled configration.xml, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:44.937 --> 00:05:49.497\nThe setup essentially is what tells\nit exactly what it's gonna do,\n\n93\n00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:52.141\nwhich is the setup process for Office.\n\n94\n00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:56.577\nThe configuration file is what\ngives us the limitations or\n\n95\n00:05:56.577 --> 00:06:00.026\nexpands out what we want\nto include in it too.\n\n96\n00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.841\nSo when you have something like this,\n\n97\n00:06:01.841 --> 00:06:04.176\nit will actually have a bit\nof information in it.\n\n98\n00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:07.422\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie, once we've\ndownloaded this file, the installation,\n\n99\n00:06:07.422 --> 00:06:08.360\nwhat do we need to do?\n\n100\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.620\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwhat we need is a centralized share.\n\n101\n00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.168\nBecause if I want to deploy this\nout throughout my organization, or\n\n102\n00:06:14.168 --> 00:06:17.660\nthroughout my entire\nActive Directory network, right?\n\n103\n00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.300\nI need a centralized location where this\nparticular program can end up running,\n\n104\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.310\nthe Office Deployment Tool.\n\n105\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.350\nSo what I've done already is I'm\ngonna switch on over to where I have\n\n106\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.270\na centralized share.\n\n107\n00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.400\nSo I'm gonna switch machines,\nthis is back on my server here.\n\n108\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.423\nOnce I do this,\nI can create a central share.\n\n109\n00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:39.368\nNow I've already done this,\ncreating a share is something that\n\n110\n00:06:39.368 --> 00:06:44.351\nyou should be fairly comfortable with\nbeing able to do, and I called it O365.\n\n111\n00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:48.582\nAll you have to do then is you need to\nput in that downloaded compressed file\n\n112\n00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:49.820\nin there, unzip it.\n\n113\n00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.846\nAnd it's gonna create two different\nfiles for you by default.\n\n114\n00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:58.569\nFirst it's gonna unzip and actually\ndo a setup for Office itself, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.126\nSo that's not exactly anything\ndifferent than what we normally see in\n\n116\n00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:05.155\na regular install, but\nit's actually just a setup.exe.\n\n117\n00:07:05.155 --> 00:07:09.125\nBut because we're manually deploying and\ntrying to control it,\n\n118\n00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:13.469\nit's also gonna create by default\na file called configuration.xml.\n\n119\n00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:16.828\nAnd it's gonna have a lot of\ndifferent settings in there, but\n\n120\n00:07:16.828 --> 00:07:20.007\nyou can really reduce it down\nto what you really need to do.\n\n121\n00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:22.260\nAnd I've already paired that one down so\n\n122\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.420\nthat we can actually do a couple of\nthings with it as we do so, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.360\nNow when we take a look at it,\nif I'm gonna right-click and\n\n124\n00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.005\ngo to Edit on that configuration file.\n\n125\n00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:33.200\nAnd that way,\n\n126\n00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.490\nlet me bring it into Notepad cuz that one\nI can control a little bit better here.\n\n127\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.520\nLet me Open with Notepad and\nthat way we'll be able to see it\n\n128\n00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.550\njust a tad bit easier and\nbetter as I zoom in, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.459\nNow you'll have to go in and you'll have\nto modify that basic configuration file.\n\n130\n00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:55.041\nThen if you don't wanna change the\noriginal configuration file that's fine,\n\n131\n00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:58.415\njust save it with a new name and just\nremember what that new name is gonna be.\n\n132\n00:07:58.415 --> 00:08:02.706\nSo one of the things you'll have to\nchange right away Is right here,\n\n133\n00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:08.540\nwhere is that you're actually going to end\nup having the Office installation files.\n\n134\n00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.640\nSo here I went ahead and\nput my source path.\n\n135\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.760\nSo regardless where I run that setup.exe,\nwhatever machine I'm on.\n\n136\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.010\nIf I run it from that,\nit's gonna come here and\n\n137\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.010\nit's gonna realize that's where\nmy source files are gonna be.\n\n138\n00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.759\nThe second option that also is out\nthere is the idea here what version of\n\n139\n00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:30.669\nOffice client as far\nas the number of bits.\n\n140\n00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:38.000\n64 or 32 bit install of\nMicrosoft Office unto your computer.\n\n141\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.860\nNow if you're running 64-bit you might\nthink of course I'm gonna install 64-bit.\n\n142\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n143\n00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.330\n&gt;&gt; But if you do this, you'll end up\nseeing that Microsoft recommends that\n\n144\n00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.880\nregardless of which version,\n64-bit really offers no benefits.\n\n145\n00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.629\n&gt;&gt; That's what you had said.\n\n146\n00:08:52.629 --> 00:08:56.785\n&gt;&gt; And they go look, run 32-bit and\nhat's the one by default right here.\n\n147\n00:08:56.785 --> 00:08:57.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n148\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.960\n&gt;&gt; But you can choose to run\nthe 64-bit if you wanted to.\n\n149\n00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.670\nIt's not gonna hurt anything.\n\n150\n00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.002\nWe also need to talk about this\nidea of the channel, okay?\n\n151\n00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:08.915\nNow this channel here is not\nreferring to where it's coming from.\n\n152\n00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:16.020\nThis is talking about the updating of\nMicrosoft Office on your computer.\n\n153\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.140\nSo right from the time that you\nchoose to deploy Microsoft Office.\n\n154\n00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.070\nYou can go ahead and set it up on\nhow you choose the deployment.\n\n155\n00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.200\nSo earlier when we saw\nthe option inside of add ins and\n\n156\n00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.750\nservices there, it gave us that global\noption of either doing the current, okay,\n\n157\n00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.770\nor doing the deferred and\nthis one by default is set up as deferred.\n\n158\n00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.220\nWhenever you do the ODT and\n\n159\n00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.670\nI think actually even when you click on\nthe Installing, the channel's actually\n\n160\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.107\ndeferred by the default-\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n161\n00:09:45.107 --> 00:09:46.860\n&gt;&gt; They're not current.\n\n162\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.310\nYou can change it to make it current.\n\n163\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.000\nAnd you can also go into the Office\nproduct to make it current too.\n\n164\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.220\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie,\njust to recap, you said that\n\n165\n00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.620\nthe deferred method was kinda deferring\nthose updates to every four months.\n\n166\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's only gonna allow it\nto come down every three months,\n\n167\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.170\nevery four months.\n\n168\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.204\nSo three times a year,\nonce a quarter, yeah.\n\n169\n00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:06.797\n&gt;&gt; So I'm trying to make\nsure I'm doing it right-\n\n170\n00:10:06.797 --> 00:10:07.978\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when I was sleeping,\n\n171\n00:10:07.978 --> 00:10:09.165\nyou're asking me about it.\n\n172\n00:10:09.165 --> 00:10:11.380\n&gt;&gt; But that's the idea right?\n\n173\n00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.960\nIt's actually gonna come in, and\nwe're gonna end up seeing that.\n\n174\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.077\nBut that's kind of the option, then.\n\n175\n00:10:16.077 --> 00:10:18.740\nYou might want to like Why the heck,\nwhy not do the current.\n\n176\n00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.971\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Well it makes sense here when I'm\n\n177\n00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:22.357\nmanually deploying it.\n\n178\n00:10:22.357 --> 00:10:26.240\nIn a small organization,\nI'm probably gonna leave it at current.\n\n179\n00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:32.880\nThe reason why is I' probably not running\na ton of line of business applications.\n\n180\n00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.558\n&gt;&gt; But you're probably not gonna\nbe using this ODT tool as well.\n\n181\n00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:38.050\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah,\nyou might not be using the ODT.\n\n182\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.910\nBut even if you are, you can change it.\n\n183\n00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.210\nAll you have to do is change the deferred\nto client and you're off and\n\n184\n00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.040\nyou're ready to go.\n\n185\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.281\nBut a lot of times as your\norganization gets bigger,\n\n186\n00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:51.047\nthat's when you start adding\nin that customized software.\n\n187\n00:10:51.047 --> 00:10:53.820\nYou start to get that\nline of business item.\n\n188\n00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.490\nYou start to run more scripts in\nthe background you start to do all these\n\n189\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.840\ndifferent things, and you are not sure\nwhether or not an update may affect it.\n\n190\n00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.300\nSo the idea of the deferred here\n\n191\n00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.160\nis something that we really want to pay\nattention to, to verify whether or not.\n\n192\n00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.490\nWhen updates come out from Microsoft\nwhether we're gonna get them very quickly\n\n193\n00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.610\nor whether we're gonna hold off on them.\n\n194\n00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:21.656\nAnd the idea of deferred also gives\nme the ability not only to download\n\n195\n00:11:21.656 --> 00:11:26.876\nthis to a regular group of users if I\nwant to, but to actually go ahead and\n\n196\n00:11:26.876 --> 00:11:31.329\nthen have another one download\nto a test group if I choose to.\n\n197\n00:11:31.329 --> 00:11:33.076\nI'm trying to make sure\nI'm saying that right.\n\n198\n00:11:33.076 --> 00:11:37.686\nAnd that way we can say all right before\nwe ever push on anything to our regular\n\n199\n00:11:37.686 --> 00:11:39.354\nusers here on the updates.\n\n200\n00:11:39.354 --> 00:11:43.116\nI'm gonna end up changing\nthat update channel itself so\n\n201\n00:11:43.116 --> 00:11:48.820\nthat I can test it out and then allow\nthat push and that update to come out.\n\n202\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.575\nSo we'll see that.\nLet's go and\n\n203\n00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:53.690\ntake a look at the screen again as we\ncontinue with a couple more options here.\n\n204\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:58.300\nThe product ID depends on\nyour particular subscription.\n\n205\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.552\nSo you might see where this one here\nby default gives us Pro Plus and\n\n206\n00:12:02.552 --> 00:12:04.034\nthis one says Retail.\n\n207\n00:12:04.034 --> 00:12:07.380\nThat depends on your subscription\nwhether it's retail or not.\n\n208\n00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.334\nThis is the one that's there by default.\n\n209\n00:12:08.334 --> 00:12:13.732\nNow if you're ever not sure,\nyou can always go out and do a search for\n\n210\n00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:20.900\nODT configuration.xml options and it'll\ntell you what all these product IDs are.\n\n211\n00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.296\nAnd give you some assistance too.\n\n212\n00:12:22.296 --> 00:12:26.820\nAlso language options depending on\nwhatever your language pack is and that\n\n213\n00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.630\ncan actually specific to wherever you're\nlocated you can change that as well or\n\n214\n00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.390\nadd in more than one.\n\n215\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:38.472\nI can simply duplicate this line and add\nanother language support if I wanted to.\n\n216\n00:12:38.472 --> 00:12:44.430\nIn the ProPlusRetail edition that\nI have available to me here,\n\n217\n00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.980\nand the licensing that I have available,\nby default this is already here.\n\n218\n00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:54.200\nIn other words, Publisher is not normally\nan installed regular part of Office 365,\n\n219\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.030\nor of the Office 2016 here.\n\n220\n00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.366\nSo this one says, let's just make sure.\n\n221\n00:12:58.366 --> 00:13:03.012\nAnd let's exclude that particular\nproduct automatically when we do this.\n\n222\n00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:08.210\nSo that is another one that we\nhave access to be able to see.\n\n223\n00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.110\nNow once we select that packaging, and\nthe way that we want it to come in.\n\n224\n00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.260\nIt is actually downloading\na different way.\n\n225\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.706\nAnd that package here on the deferred.\n\n226\n00:13:16.706 --> 00:13:22.360\nBut notice that you actually can kind\nof specify a little bit more, okay.\n\n227\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.340\nNow I normally kind of gloss through\nthis stuff very quickly, but\n\n228\n00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.830\nthis is something we don't\nwant to gloss through.\n\n229\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:34.240\nBecause it's very important that we\nunderstand this idea of this channel,\n\n230\n00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.515\nand that we're talking about.\n\n231\n00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:38.891\nAnd so\nhere you start to see something else too.\n\n232\n00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:43.693\nFor the updates themselves, even though\nwe've already selected defer channel,\n\n233\n00:13:43.693 --> 00:13:47.740\nnotice I can actually turn it off if\nI choose to, by simply taking it and\n\n234\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.610\nsaying look,\nI don't want this thing to update at all.\n\n235\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:56.970\nI can simply choose fault here if that was\nsomething that was actually thought that,\n\n236\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:02.360\nI can't actually do a,\nI was hoping to do a Ctrl + Z,\n\n237\n00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.940\nand it didn't do a Ctrl + Z for me.\n\n238\n00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.218\nSo there we go.\n\n239\n00:14:06.218 --> 00:14:10.300\nSo there's the enabled aspect of that.\n\n240\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.100\nLet me kind of zoom out for\na moment, there we go.\n\n241\n00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.460\nAnd this is something I\nalso wanna point out too.\n\n242\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.490\nNow notice here Cherokee, on this one,\non the update path itself.\n\n243\n00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.381\n&gt;&gt; Not known listed.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it doesn't look like anything is\n\n244\n00:14:25.381 --> 00:14:25.990\nlisted.\n\n245\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.710\nHow do I update if I don't have a path?\n\n246\n00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.090\nWhat do you think happens here?\n\n247\n00:14:32.252 --> 00:14:34.924\nMaybe it points back to that\nconfiguration file that we saw earlier.\n\n248\n00:14:34.924 --> 00:14:37.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah like anything else,\nright, there's a default.\n\n249\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.730\nEven if we don't have anything listed,\nokay?\n\n250\n00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.786\nSo updates, Microsoft has chosen,\neven beginning with Windows 2010, right?\n\n251\n00:14:43.786 --> 00:14:46.600\nYou're not gonna be able\nto refuse updates, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.795\nWell it doesn't matter if they go over\nhere, Windows 2010, not Windows 2010.\n\n253\n00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:54.920\nWindows 10, Windows 2010,\nWindows 10 right?\n\n254\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.278\nThe updates you don't get to turn those\nupdates off, you just deal get them later,\n\n255\n00:14:59.278 --> 00:15:01.596\nbut you gonna get them in some point,\nokay.\n\n256\n00:15:01.596 --> 00:15:02.480\n&gt;&gt; Not easily.\n\n257\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.560\n&gt;&gt; But you gonna give, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.320\nSo the same thing is, what they\nactually figure out is this right,\n\n259\n00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.210\nif you can't turn them off\nin the operating system.\n\n260\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.990\nWe're really not gonna allow you to\nturn them off here very easily, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.030\nSo, if you have them\nenabled as going true,\n\n262\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.480\nit's gonna follow the same deferment\nchannel of what we're gonna do.\n\n263\n00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.980\nBut the update path, it automatically\nsays, if you don't list anything,\n\n264\n00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.740\nit's gonna update directly from Office,\nitself, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.733\nSo the Office 365 their\nparticular distribution network\n\n266\n00:15:32.733 --> 00:15:35.328\nis gonna reach out to the Internet-\n&gt;&gt; As long as it has that\n\n267\n00:15:35.328 --> 00:15:36.370\nconnection, yeah.\n\n268\n00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\ndon't worry if there's not one here.\n\n269\n00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.020\nBut if your company has\na security policy and\n\n270\n00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.080\nyou're running a Windows Update service,\nwell, what are you gonna put here?\n\n271\n00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.923\nYou're gonna put the path to your\nWindows Update service here, okay?\n\n272\n00:15:49.923 --> 00:15:54.177\nBut, if you're not, it simply goes out and\nreaches across the internet and\n\n273\n00:15:54.177 --> 00:15:57.718\ngives us that chance to download\nthose updates from there too.\n\n274\n00:15:57.718 --> 00:15:58.603\nOkay?\n\n275\n00:15:58.603 --> 00:16:00.810\nSo those are things that\nwe also have to do.\n\n276\n00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.010\nAnd we're gonna take a look here.\n\n277\n00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.378\nDisplay level none means we're\nnot actually gonna wait for\n\n278\n00:16:05.378 --> 00:16:09.750\nCherokee to accept whether or\nnot she wants Office on the computer..\n\n279\n00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.920\nIf I run this,\nit's gonna run in the background.\n\n280\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.030\nNothing is going to actually display for\nher.\n\n281\n00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.080\nIs gonna automatically accept\nthe end user licensing agreement.\n\n282\n00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.250\n&gt;&gt; You're accepting it on my behalf.\n\n283\n00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.980\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and so that way what\nshould happen is that Cherokee or\n\n284\n00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.670\nanybody else in the organization\ndoesn't know that the Office product\n\n285\n00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.570\nis really being installed as\nwe have this go on, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.060\nNow, the reason why I wanted\nto kind of leave differed and\n\n287\n00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:40.030\nthis idea of the update channels last,\nIs because you need to know\n\n288\n00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.270\nwhich ones you're choosing and\nwhy you would choose one over the other.\n\n289\n00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:44.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n290\n00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.225\n&gt;&gt; Is what we actually need to do.\n\n291\n00:16:46.225 --> 00:16:52.200\nOkay so, here when you actually start\nto take a look at these options here,\n\n292\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.460\nyou will have a couple of different\nones that are available to you.\n\n293\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.050\nOkay?\n\n294\n00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.050\nSo the deferred one is right there but\n\n295\n00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.490\nif we chose the one that's called current,\nOkay?\n\n296\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.590\nCurrent actually gives us this\nability to have the newest features\n\n297\n00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:08.020\nwhen they're normally available, okay?\n\n298\n00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.510\nIt's gonna actually be once a month\n\n299\n00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.780\nat least is what we're\ngonna end up seeing here.\n\n300\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.590\nBut when a new feature comes out and\nit's time for an update, it will do that.\n\n301\n00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.080\nSo even if, let's say for\n\n302\n00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:24.870\nexample it's that second Tuesday,\nthat super Tuesday update.\n\n303\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.590\nRemember I told you that every super\nTuesday essentially a new version\n\n304\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.960\nof Office comes out.\n\n305\n00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.420\nEven if you just a week later they\n\n306\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.700\nintroduce a new feature\nthat's actually in there.\n\n307\n00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.600\nGuess what and\n\n308\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.190\nthey go we're pushing this out as\nan update because you just logged on.\n\n309\n00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.620\nYou'll get that new feature.\n\n310\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.500\nYou don't have to wait\nuntil the month later.\n\n311\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.660\nIt will come out when that\nactually chooses to come out.\n\n312\n00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.070\nBut normally it actually comes\nout at that monthly interval.\n\n313\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.350\nBut it can do it.\n\n314\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.290\nSo you'll always be ahead of\nthat game if you do that.\n\n315\n00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:58.080\nIf I'm not doing any particular\ntesting for anything else,\n\n316\n00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.210\nwell this is actually something that\nI would probably go ahead and do.\n\n317\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.740\nSo as long as I don't need\ntesting on any products,\n\n318\n00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.540\nI'm not running any real line\nof business applications,\n\n319\n00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.970\nthen I'm probably gonna leave it at what\nwe call that at current channel instead.\n\n320\n00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:18.180\nAnd all you do is you type in current\nhere, and then you're ready to go, okay.\n\n321\n00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.800\nBut the deferred channel, though, this\nis normally the default one that is set\n\n322\n00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.550\nup for all Office 365 Pro Plus accounts.\n\n323\n00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.460\nIs what you're going to end up getting.\n\n324\n00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.640\nAnd so this will come out every four\nmonths behind the current channel.\n\n325\n00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.530\nSo as the current channel\nis updating every month.\n\n326\n00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.390\nThis will wait every four\nmonths before it comes out.\n\n327\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:46.400\nAnd this provides us a little bit of time\nthen as the IT staff to go ahead and\n\n328\n00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.570\ntest the new feature.\n\n329\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.030\nSee if anything actually ends up breaking,\nokay.\n\n330\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.690\nBefore we actually go ahead and\npush this out.\n\n331\n00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:00.400\nSo if things are currently working\nthen we can actually say what I want\n\n332\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.250\nto do right now Is let's see as\neverything is pushed out here\n\n333\n00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.300\nthat it gave me a chance before\nit comes out to test it.\n\n334\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.420\nNow the other one that I want to\nmake sure that we understand here\n\n335\n00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.710\nis going to be of course\nthere is one more.\n\n336\n00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.940\nActually there may be two more but we're\nonly gonna focus in on this one more.\n\n337\n00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.880\nIt's called first release\ndiffered channel, okay?\n\n338\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.830\nFirst release for differed channel,\nnow what does that mean?\n\n339\n00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:34.240\nWell, this gives you the chance as the IT\nadministrator as I have a differed\n\n340\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:40.310\nchannel, I can now take my test PC or\nwhatever it is and\n\n341\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:45.200\nactually run this one instead in that\nchannel update is what I'm going to do.\n\n342\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.140\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, when I'm setting\nup this configuration file, if\n\n343\n00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.670\nI choose this parameter, it means that I'm\ngoing to be getting these updates first so\n\n344\n00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:52.550\nthat I can test them.\n\n345\n00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.760\nIs that what I'm understanding here?\n\n346\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.750\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n347\n00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.900\nSo, you actually get it along with\nthe current update that comes out.\n\n348\n00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.970\nAnd then that gives you now that\nability to have a test bed,\n\n349\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.750\nwhere you're not saying,\nI'm gonna update everything right away.\n\n350\n00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.170\nBut it gives you that ability to say,\nin my test environment,\n\n351\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.850\nI wanna run those updates.\n\n352\n00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.380\nTest it against everything else, and then\nI'll know if that If something breaks at\n\n353\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.960\nthat point that deferred update will end\nup, it will be three or four months later.\n\n354\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.760\nThat gives me time to fix\nwhat needs to be fixed.\n\n355\n00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.310\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n\n356\n00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.240\n&gt;&gt; To do everything that we want to,\nto identify that.\n\n357\n00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.170\nThe unusual thing about these\ndeferred updates, though,\n\n358\n00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:35.020\nis that normally at this point when you\ndo these this is the first Release for\n\n359\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.440\ndiffered channel, you don't get any new\nfeatures, so unlike the current one,\n\n360\n00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.170\nthe current channel, where you get new\nfeatures and everything that are added\n\n361\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:49.860\nbut, this one though, it adds in security\nupdates and performance updates, okay.\n\n362\n00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.320\nFor things like stability, and\nperformance, it does all those but\n\n363\n00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.540\nit doesn't add in any new features.\n\n364\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.790\nSo if you're doing this,\nthis is really strictly for testing.\n\n365\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.070\nSo imagine in your environment\nas it grows and grows, right?\n\n366\n00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.070\nAnd as you add in more and\n\n367\n00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.070\nmore software, which can have things\nthat conflict with each other.\n\n368\n00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.150\nYou might actually choose all three,\nokay, is what you might choose.\n\n369\n00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.750\nOr you might choose that\nfirst release deferred.\n\n370\n00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.530\nAnd the differ right, you test it out, you\ngo I know what's coming out in the future.\n\n371\n00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.120\nIn other words I'm gonna\nrun this right now.\n\n372\n00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.300\nCherokees gonna get this\nfour months from now, okay.\n\n373\n00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.890\nSo I run it on my machine which\nshould be an identical set up to\n\n374\n00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:31.290\nsomething that Cherokee's actually,\nher computer's doing, and\n\n375\n00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:35.200\nthen I can test it against every\napplication that Cherokee's going on.\n\n376\n00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.690\nSo at that point, if now we find out\nthat there's an issue with a macro,\n\n377\n00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.360\nthere's an issue with some\nscript that's running,\n\n378\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.120\nif whatever it is,\nit's not affecting Cherokee.\n\n379\n00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:53.140\nThen the IT staff can work on work around\nor fixing the issue during that point.\n\n380\n00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.100\nAnd from that point, once that's done,\nwe push out those fixes,\n\n381\n00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.295\nmaybe through Group Policy.\n\n382\n00:21:57.295 --> 00:22:02.090\net that done, and then by the time\nCherokee's deferred channel\n\n383\n00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:07.165\nupdate comes along, it shouldn't affect\nCherokee, okay, is what would happen.\n\n384\n00:22:07.165 --> 00:22:09.921\nNow, before, cuz I know I'm talking a lot.\n\n385\n00:22:09.921 --> 00:22:10.809\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I get it,\n\n386\n00:22:10.809 --> 00:22:13.744\nit's kind of like releasing\nan animal that's been in captivity.\n\n387\n00:22:13.744 --> 00:22:15.575\nYou just don't want to\nlet it out into the wild.\n\n388\n00:22:15.575 --> 00:22:17.085\nWe've got baby steps here.\n\n389\n00:22:17.085 --> 00:22:20.165\nSo you go through this process,\nmake sure everything's good to go.\n\n390\n00:22:20.165 --> 00:22:21.670\nThe animal knows how to eat on its own.\n\n391\n00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.255\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; And then you let it go.\n\n392\n00:22:23.255 --> 00:22:25.790\n&gt;&gt; Well, sorta,\nthat sounds like a good idea.\n\n393\n00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; It does,\n\n394\n00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.940\nit's actually one of these process.\n\n395\n00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.720\nBut if you're still having\na problem trying to,\n\n396\n00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.180\nI'm not visualizing what\nyou're talking about.\n\n397\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.790\nLet's take a look at my screen here and\nI'll try and\n\n398\n00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.940\nmake sure that I include this into\nthe show notes as far as the link here.\n\n399\n00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.680\nThis is directly from Microsoft and\nso I like this.\n\n400\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.580\nThere's no way I was gonna\nduplicate all these little boxes.\n\n401\n00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.970\nto help us out here.\n\n402\n00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.430\n&gt;&gt; It would have been fun right?\n\n403\n00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:54.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah fun,\ncurrent channel right here, is red.\n\n404\n00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.830\nFirst released for deferred channel,\nbrown is deferred channel and\n\n405\n00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.120\nthen yellow is security updates So\n\n406\n00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.940\nnotice that on the current channel\nevery single month, right?\n\n407\n00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.330\nOctober all the way\nthrough to January here,\n\n408\n00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.020\nof the following year,\nas you start seeing that.\n\n409\n00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.430\nAnd then, notice this, right.\n\n410\n00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.410\nIf you're on the current channel,\nyou'd get it right then.\n\n411\n00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.310\nAnd then if you're doing that\nfirst release deployment,\n\n412\n00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.570\nthis is probably to your\ntesting deployment,\n\n413\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:27.200\nYou also essentially have the same\ntypes of things going on here.\n\n414\n00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.750\nBut remember up here you're not going\nto get any feature updates, ok.\n\n415\n00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:35.810\nSo then once everything you tested is\ndone, that is what's going to end up\n\n416\n00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.850\nbeing your deferred channel update\nis what would normally happen and\n\n417\n00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.350\nthen it starts all over here.\n\n418\n00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.440\nWhen you update, when everybody else\nupdates to that preferred channel.\n\n419\n00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.140\nYou're now getting the first release for\nthe next time.\n\n420\n00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.796\nAnd it's gonna continue to go on and on.\n\n421\n00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:54.030\nBut in between this period\nyou're fixing things.\n\n422\n00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.215\nIf anything actually needs to be fixed,\nyou're doing that.\n\n423\n00:23:57.215 --> 00:24:00.845\nIf you don't have any of that,\nyou simply follow this red line and\n\n424\n00:24:00.845 --> 00:24:03.430\nyou continue to go on through, okay.\n\n425\n00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:07.633\nThe orange one's really only for testing,\nespecially if you're updating or\n\n426\n00:24:07.633 --> 00:24:09.910\nyou're upgrading, let's say.\n\n427\n00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.180\nWhatever it might be,\n\n428\n00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.470\nyou wanna make sure that you're actually\nfollowing that all the way through.\n\n429\n00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:18.560\nBut, notice that it's really this\nthat makes it different too.\n\n430\n00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.430\nYour deferred channel updates,\n\n431\n00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:25.680\nit's in between the time you're\nalso getting security updates.\n\n432\n00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.750\nSo it's not gonna say, all right, we'll\njust jump down to this current channel and\n\n433\n00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.790\njust release everything.\n\n434\n00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:34.230\nIt will continue to update for\nyour security if it needs to, for\n\n435\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.940\nperformance, for\neverything else that it needs.\n\n436\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.870\nAnd then that second\ndeployment will come out and\n\n437\n00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.970\nyou'll continue to update along that path.\n\n438\n00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.030\nAnd this is where it\ngets a little bit tricky.\n\n439\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:50.360\nNotice that after that second one,\nthat second deferred update, look at this.\n\n440\n00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.170\nNotice that this is blank here, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.380\nNow what does that mean?\n\n442\n00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.830\nThat means that it's gonna be supportive.\n\n443\n00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.430\nThe last current update, or\nthat deferred channel update,\n\n444\n00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.430\nis supported pretty much through\nits own cycle and the next one.\n\n445\n00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.450\nBut when that third one comes out,\nit essentially drops support here.\n\n446\n00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.840\n&gt;&gt; They want you to move\nto the newer edition?\n\n447\n00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.270\n&gt;&gt; They want you to move\nto the newer edition.\n\n448\n00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.630\nSo it is here that it will pick up again.\n\n449\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.630\nAnd it will continue to do that.\n\n450\n00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.870\nSo in other words what you're\ngonna find out is this.\n\n451\n00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.450\nYou're never gonna be two channels or\nthree channels behind, okay?\n\n452\n00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:25.830\nThree channels, I'm trying to make sure.\n\n453\n00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.570\nYou're never gonna be three\nchannels behind in terms of\n\n454\n00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.350\nthe deferred update, okay?\n\n455\n00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.080\nBecause it's just not gonna\nbe supported anymore.\n\n456\n00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.640\nIt's gonna essentially make\nyou update at some point\n\n457\n00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.450\nis what you're gonna end up seeing.\n\n458\n00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:43.398\nSo that's a part of the process of\nunderstanding these stricter channel\n\n459\n00:25:43.398 --> 00:25:45.434\nupdates as we do them, okay?\n\n460\n00:25:45.434 --> 00:25:48.099\nNow you might be wondering like,\nis it really important that we know it,\n\n461\n00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:49.130\nand yes, okay.\n\n462\n00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.700\nBecause updates are very essential,\nespecially to applications.\n\n463\n00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.500\nIf your operating system is up to date but\nyour applications aren't?\n\n464\n00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.365\nWell, there is your big doorway and\n\n465\n00:25:59.365 --> 00:26:04.480\nannouncement banner to the world that\nI'm not updating my Office deployment.\n\n466\n00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.510\nSo let's figure out what security\nupdates that Ronnie is now missing.\n\n467\n00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:09.220\nLike here, okay.\n\n468\n00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.270\n&gt;&gt; Currently, yeah.\n\n469\n00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.810\n&gt;&gt; And then they might be able to\nfigure out a way into my system.\n\n470\n00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.430\nSo we always wanna keep them\nas up to date as possible but\n\n471\n00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:22.380\nwe also need to test them for fixes and\nfor compatibility issues that we'll have.\n\n472\n00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.520\nSo that's a big part of it.\n\n473\n00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.690\nSince I talked about updates\npretty much this whole episode,\n\n474\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.580\nwe never got to that point where\nwe actually deployed anything.\n\n475\n00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.810\nSo Cherokee, that means I really have\nto actually do some deployment now,\n\n476\n00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.320\nbut that means a part three.\n\n477\n00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.890\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, we've done it before.\n\n478\n00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:39.710\nLadies and gentlemen, stay tuned,\nwe are gonna have a part three.\n\n479\n00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.120\nBut for this episode,\nwe'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n480\n00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.010\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n481\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n482\n00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.136\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n483\n00:26:47.136 --> 00:26:54.032\n[MUSIC]\n\n484\n00:26:54.032

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.880\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Enabling Office\n365 Services Series.\n\n4\n00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.830\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.470\nAnd yes, we have made it to part\nthree where we continue to look at\n\n6\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.320\nmanaging our client deployments\nfrom an IT department perspective.\n\n7\n00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.800\nWith us today back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.460\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.640\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back,\n\n10\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.570\nI know that part three is\nnot a super unusual for me.\n\n11\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.000\nBut it is actually something\nwe needed to do here.\n\n12\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.410\nOf course that means in part one and\n\n13\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.280\npart two we've discussed some of\nthe things that you really need to look at\n\n14\n00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.123\nfrom the IT management perspective,\nmaking sure that you understand some of\n\n15\n00:00:47.123 --> 00:00:51.920\nthe different things that you have to just\nwrap your head around for that management.\n\n16\n00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.750\nNow we're gonna head into just\nshowing you how it works.\n\n17\n00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.320\nThe deployment aspect of what\nwe need to make sure of is\n\n18\n00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.290\npretty much a key aspect of\nwhat we do from this point.\n\n19\n00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.720\nSo now that we have\nthe Office Deployment Toolkit.\n\n20\n00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.060\nAnd I've downloaded the one for\nthe 2016 version.\n\n21\n00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.180\nAnd the reason why is if you go,\nhey I wanna deploy Office 2013.\n\n22\n00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.931\nThe good thing is Office 2016 Deployment\nToolkit will also help you do that too,\n\n23\n00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:23.118\nso it'll do both if you want to.\n\n24\n00:01:23.118 --> 00:01:27.525\nSo you can do that or if you choose to you\ncan always go in and find the link for\n\n25\n00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:30.400\nthe download to the Office 2013 one.\n\n26\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.710\nAnd either one's fine.\n\n27\n00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.420\nBut now that we've got that\non the actual machines,\n\n28\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.700\nwe're now ready to talk\nabout that deployment.\n\n29\n00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.020\nBut remember that before you\njust choose one option or\n\n30\n00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.130\nthe other here, of what you're gonna do,\nyou really do need to plan this out.\n\n31\n00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.440\nYou know is my organization\ngonna need testing\n\n32\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.040\nbecause I realize that I got a lot\nof different line of business apps.\n\n33\n00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.370\nWhere I do run a lot of different\nscripts in the background.\n\n34\n00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.610\nI have things that possibly\nthese updates can do this.\n\n35\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.680\nSo if you're gonna do that,\nyou might want to go ahead and plan out\n\n36\n00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.600\nhow am I going to deploy this and to whom\nam I going to deploy and in what way?\n\n37\n00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.880\n&gt;&gt; Kind of rolling it\nout in waves perhaps?\n\n38\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.720\n&gt;&gt; Either rolling it out in waves or\nsetting up those two different options or\n\n39\n00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.650\nthree different options.\n\n40\n00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.120\nYou set up a current\ngroup if you choose to.\n\n41\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.710\nGo look, I'm not so\nworried about these guys,\n\n42\n00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.200\nlet them update it quickly as they can.\n\n43\n00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.790\nThen maybe the main body of users you\nset up in that deferred group instead,\n\n44\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.440\nand you push them out according\nto that deferred update schedule.\n\n45\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.540\nAnd then you're testing machines\nwhen you do something like this.\n\n46\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.110\nYou may actually want to choose\nto do all three of them.\n\n47\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.820\nAnd just choose those\noptions as you do that.\n\n48\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.430\nAnd that way,\nyou kind of have a test ready to go.\n\n49\n00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.480\nYou have users that you're not\nreally concerned about, and\n\n50\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.655\nthey can get updated as\nquickly as possible.\n\n51\n00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:58.200\nBut maybe in your main body, you go,\nno, if they're inside of my network all\n\n52\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.740\nthe time on regular desktop machines, I've\ngotta make sure that this doesn't break.\n\n53\n00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.810\nThen you roll out the defer there,\nand that's kind of the standard here.\n\n54\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.170\nSmall environments, we're probably not\ngonna do that very often, if at all.\n\n55\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.330\nBut in a big environment\nyou probably will, and\n\n56\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.630\nyou want to make sure that you figure\nout which one you're gonna choose.\n\n57\n00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.130\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we have been\ntalking about using our ODT tool.\n\n58\n00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.590\nAre you gonna be able to\nshow us in this episode?\n\n59\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.450\n&gt;&gt; That's the hope, right, is that\nwe actually do get to see this here.\n\n60\n00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.620\nSo let's go ahead and see what we\nnormally end up getting once we download.\n\n61\n00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.660\nSo on this machine that I have right\nin front of me, I went ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.070\ndownloaded and\nexpanded this out on my computer.\n\n63\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.250\nSo I've just selected\nthe Windows Explorer, and\n\n64\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.850\nonce I do that let me go\ninto the Office 365 folder,\n\n65\n00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.470\nand here notice that there\nis a folder called ODT 2016.\n\n66\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.040\nNow I just created this one and\n\n67\n00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.040\nwhen I expand that out what's\nyou're gonna end up seeing is this.\n\n68\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.010\nSo this is a default set up and\nif you do this, you wanna do it on that\n\n69\n00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.940\ncentralized share, wherever you're\nactually going to be running this from.\n\n70\n00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.410\nAnd you're not gonna do\nanything with this file,\n\n71\n00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.460\nthat's the one you're gonna run from\nwhatever computer that you go to.\n\n72\n00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.895\nBut the other one is gonna be right\nhere where we have the configuration.\n\n73\n00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:19.908\nSo when you download it, it actually\ncreates that file for you as well.\n\n74\n00:04:19.908 --> 00:04:22.890\nI don't wanna open it up in Notepad,\n\n75\n00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:29.170\na little bit zoomed in there inside\nof Notepad so that we can see this.\n\n76\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.540\nThat is not the default one,\nwhere did I put my default install here?\n\n77\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.180\nThere it is, I actually led you to\nthe one I'm actually gonna be using here.\n\n78\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.510\nSo I was trying to show what\nit looked like by default.\n\n79\n00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.250\nWhat I did is I named\nthem exactly the same.\n\n80\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.820\n&gt;&gt; Well now we can compare\nthe two [CROSSTALK].\n\n81\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.170\n&gt;&gt; I was looking at it,\nno that's actually not the right one.\n\n82\n00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.010\nSo here's what you normally end\nup seeing in this file here.\n\n83\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.640\nLet me do a little bit of a word wrap so\nthat we can see, actually that looks ugly.\n\n84\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.230\nLet me just change the font size\ndown just a little bit here.\n\n85\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.230\nAnd that will help us\nout just a little bit.\n\n86\n00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.720\nI'll change it down to 16.\n\n87\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.920\nAnd that's a little bit better, so\nthat we can see the information.\n\n88\n00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.210\nSo right at the beginning it helps you out\nby giving you all of this detail here.\n\n89\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.090\nIt's a sample file, you don't have\nto get rid of all this stuff, but\n\n90\n00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.690\nI normally do here.\n\n91\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.951\nAnd you can see here that it tells you\nthis is what you actually need to be\n\n92\n00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:27.514\nable to do.\n\n93\n00:05:27.514 --> 00:05:30.800\nAnd it says you'll need\nto use the 2013 version,\n\n94\n00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.120\nwhich can be downloaded if you\nhave Office Client apps with 2013.\n\n95\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.610\nSo this one is actually telling you, hey,\nyou can't actually use the 2016 tool.\n\n96\n00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.320\nBut I believe you actually can, so I may\nbe wrong on that now that I read that.\n\n97\n00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.160\nBut so here, you actually go ahead,\nand what we're gonna look for\n\n98\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.090\nis right here in the configuration.\n\n99\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.550\nAnd this one's just a little bit\n\n100\n00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.940\nlarger than what I had at\nthe one that I showed you.\n\n101\n00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.680\nAnd I didn't remove much,\nI simply removed all this stuff up here so\n\n102\n00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.170\nit will be a little bit\neasier to focus in on.\n\n103\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.530\nBut you can see here it is,\nthey added in one line.\n\n104\n00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.610\nNotice that this one is ready to go for\nthe channel as being current.\n\n105\n00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.580\nAnd from this point,\nyou see where it says,\n\n106\n00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.208\npull from the Office Pro Plus\nretail version, here.\n\n107\n00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:22.050\nAnd then the other thing is you can also\nsee what product they want you to install.\n\n108\n00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.710\nSo if you wanted to,\n\n109\n00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.690\nyou could list out all the individual\nproducts to install instead.\n\n110\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.610\nBut this one is Office Pro Plus,\nalong with Visual Pro Retail.\n\n111\n00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.870\nAnd that's normally gonna be a separate\n\n112\n00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.670\nsubscription price that you'll also\nhave to pay for that one if you do that.\n\n113\n00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.810\nBut that's pretty much it,\n\n114\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.060\nthe only other thing that they added\nin was right down here at the bottom.\n\n115\n00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.230\nBut notice that this one actually has a\nlittle exclamation point at the beginning.\n\n116\n00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.270\nSo it's saying this isn't turned on.\n\n117\n00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.970\nSo this idea of auto-activate,\n\n118\n00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.710\nthe great thing is if you're missing it,\nit's still gonna do it.\n\n119\n00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.010\nSo you don't have to, but\n\n120\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.830\nif you're mainly trying to control this,\nyou can actually turn all these things on.\n\n121\n00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.750\nThat way, you know exactly\nwhat's running and what isn't.\n\n122\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.266\nIt's gonna activate,\n\n123\n00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:12.265\nonce you install it onto the computer,\nwhen you log in, your Office product is\n\n124\n00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:17.222\ngoing to automatically hit that Office\nactivation server that's up there.\n\n125\n00:07:17.222 --> 00:07:22.027\nAnd it's gonna issue you a validated key,\nthen it's gonna do a validation server and\n\n126\n00:07:22.027 --> 00:07:24.096\nmake sure that everything is good and\n\n127\n00:07:24.096 --> 00:07:26.730\nextend that key out every\ntime you connect in.\n\n128\n00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.640\nSo there is kind of a default in\nwhat we actually have to set up,\n\n129\n00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.850\nas we're actually doing this.\n\n130\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.260\nNow, let's say that this\nis what we've now got.\n\n131\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.850\nAnd now we've figured out we want to\ndeploy this is two different ways.\n\n132\n00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.020\nWe want to set up our testing environment.\n\n133\n00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.330\nWe also want to be to set up\nthat deferred channel as well.\n\n134\n00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.338\nSo we can do this by changing that\nconfig file so that we actually\n\n135\n00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:57.162\nknow what we're going to run and\nhow we're going to do this.\n\n136\n00:07:57.162 --> 00:08:00.762\nSo normally the first thing\nthat we need to do, of course,\n\n137\n00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:03.340\nis connect into that centralized share.\n\n138\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.350\nSo I'm simply going to bring\nup the command prompt here and\n\n139\n00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.490\nhopefully everybody can see that.\n\n140\n00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.120\nAnd I just wanna make sure, I normally map\nit to the Y drive, and it's not there.\n\n141\n00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.994\nSo I'm gonna do my net use y:.\n\n142\n00:08:19.994 --> 00:08:26.222\nAnd this should be 0365-DC01 for\n\n143\n00:08:26.222 --> 00:08:30.992\nthe server and then 0365.\n\n144\n00:08:30.992 --> 00:08:34.871\nAnd that's gonna ask me for the username,\n\n145\n00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:39.725\nwhich should be that\npre2000officeprodemoco,\n\n146\n00:08:39.725 --> 00:08:43.626\ndemoco, there we go, \\administrator.\n\n147\n00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:52.600\nAnd then my super secret password, and now\nthe command has completed successfully.\n\n148\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:59.210\nDo a dir, and you can see I've already\ncreated a couple of different ones.\n\n149\n00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:04.420\nActually three different ones for\nus to take a look at as well, okay?\n\n150\n00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.920\nOnce you say hey, I'm gonna create this\nin a different fashion, right, and\n\n151\n00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.420\nyou realize you're gonna be deploying it\nto the first release deferred channel.\n\n152\n00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.550\nAs well as the deferred channel\nyou may go ahead and do this.\n\n153\n00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.830\nSo here at the top one,\nI named it what I wanted to.\n\n154\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.610\nIf I want to do the current release\nthis is the one I would choose, right?\n\n155\n00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:29.090\nAnd it's just configo365_current.\n\n156\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:34.100\nHere's that first release\ndeferred channel, frdc.\n\n157\n00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.520\nSo if I wanted to do that one\nwe would do that one as well.\n\n158\n00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.684\nAnd this one is just a standard one that\ncame along where I'd modified it just\n\n159\n00:09:41.684 --> 00:09:45.150\na little bit to remove some of\nthe extra verbage that was there.\n\n160\n00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.130\n&gt;&gt; The extra header.\n\n161\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that we have.\n\n162\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.550\nBut there's also another\none that I have up here\n\n163\n00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.970\nwhich is this one right\nhere that says excel.\n\n164\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.550\nAnd this is where I actually chose\nto deploy this one to a machine, but\n\n165\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:03.640\nthe only thing I really wanted\non that install was Excel, okay?\n\n166\n00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.950\nSo if you wanted to,\n\n167\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.860\nyou can actually deploy in these\ndifferent ways to help you out, okay?\n\n168\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.550\nSo that's what normally ends\nup happening when you do this.\n\n169\n00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:19.350\nNow in this folder,\nthe deployment files I already downloaded.\n\n170\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.360\nAnd that was for\n\n171\n00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.420\nthe sake of the continuity of the show\nmore than anything else here.\n\n172\n00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.850\nBecause it's gonna reach\nout to Microsoft and\n\n173\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:32.270\ndownload the installation files for\nOffice itself, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.190\nNow when it does that,\nit's perfectly fine,\n\n175\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:39.420\nit's gonna end up saving it in a directory\nin that shared folder that we have\n\n176\n00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.040\nalong with what we see right\nhere in this configuration.\n\n177\n00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.110\nSo let me go ahead and pull that up here,\nlet me type in notepad,\n\n178\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:54.665\nthen configuration.xml.\n\n179\n00:10:57.114 --> 00:11:02.514\nSo one of the first things that I did,\nright, is that when I run a program\n\n180\n00:11:02.514 --> 00:11:08.370\nI need to tell it, when you actually run\nthis set up, I need to download this.\n\n181\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.340\nAnd I need to tell it where\nit was gonna download.\n\n182\n00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.602\nWhat particular edition, 32-bit or 64.\n\n183\n00:11:13.602 --> 00:11:18.862\nI also need to tell it what channel as\nwell as the version of the product and\n\n184\n00:11:18.862 --> 00:11:20.510\neven what to exclude.\n\n185\n00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.750\nIn other words don't download\nthis if you don't want to.\n\n186\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.890\nThe rest of it's pretty much the same.\n\n187\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.960\nNow the way that you do that,\nokay, is if you don't\n\n188\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.530\nhave the office install files on your\ncomputer and you simply run setup.\n\n189\n00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.080\nNow I like the tab fill.\n\n190\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.758\nBecause I know that's\nactually right there.\n\n191\n00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:39.840\nThere's the setup from the ODT tool.\n\n192\n00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.020\nThen I do a forward slash and\nI tell it download.\n\n193\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.180\nFrom this point I tell it which of those\nconfiguration files I am going to use.\n\n194\n00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.070\nAnd then it's just config.xml.\n\n195\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.700\nAnd what that will do is it will\nautomatically start that process of\n\n196\n00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:01.510\ndownloading those configuration\nfiles to your centralized share.\n\n197\n00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.300\nNow this is a very important\npart of the process here.\n\n198\n00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:10.440\nIdeally, right, the way that we used to do\nthis, if we were to have those downloads.\n\n199\n00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.314\nEven if you were to install this on\na regular computer, like with a .msi file,\n\n200\n00:12:15.314 --> 00:12:16.100\nright?\n\n201\n00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.440\nA Microsoft installer, okay?\n\n202\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.630\nWhat you would end up getting,\nis that you'd have to make sure that\n\n203\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:27.030\nthat entire msi file ended up getting\ndownloaded to that computer first.\n\n204\n00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.680\nAnd then you could run\nthe installation on what you needed.\n\n205\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.694\nBut today, and\nthe way that this ends up working,\n\n206\n00:12:34.694 --> 00:12:39.377\nit downloads a special form of\na streaming type of download\n\n207\n00:12:39.377 --> 00:12:43.503\nthat we call a C2R or\na click to run type of install.\n\n208\n00:12:43.503 --> 00:12:49.758\nAnd that means I don't have to download\nthe entirety of Office if I wanted to\n\n209\n00:12:49.758 --> 00:12:57.500\nfirst, before I can start installing the\nactual program on to different computers.\n\n210\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.490\nBut it does take a bit longer,\n\n211\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.810\nespecially if you go, okay,\nit's not completely downloaded.\n\n212\n00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.030\nBut I want to install all of Office.\n\n213\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.640\nWell, it's not going to have\ndownloaded everything yet.\n\n214\n00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.860\nSo it's not going to install very quickly.\n\n215\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.190\nBut if you do let this run,\nit will run and\n\n216\n00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.550\nthen at the end of it,\nyou just verify that is down running.\n\n217\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.260\nNow let me show you what\nhappens when you do this, okay?\n\n218\n00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.705\nSo after you press Enter here, it's just\ngonna blink, the cursor is gonna blink.\n\n219\n00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:27.368\nUntil you see that you're at the command\nprompt again, it's not done, okay?\n\n220\n00:13:27.368 --> 00:13:30.747\nAnd that's pretty much kind of the easiest\nway that I know that you can verify that\n\n221\n00:13:30.747 --> 00:13:32.150\nyou've downloaded every file.\n\n222\n00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.660\nNow I'm not gonna worry about\nsince I've already downloaded.\n\n223\n00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.930\nCuz you'll see that it will create\nthis office folder for you and\n\n224\n00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:46.310\nthen if I change directories here,\nto office and\n\n225\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.230\ndo a dir, you'll see that there\nis a folder inside called data.\n\n226\n00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:56.084\nAnd it's in here, that you can see these\ncab files, as well as this directory for\n\n227\n00:13:56.084 --> 00:14:00.327\nversion 16.0.7369.2120 which is the latest\n\n228\n00:14:00.327 --> 00:14:06.190\nversion that it could download at\nthe point when I download it, okay?\n\n229\n00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.920\nSo if you were to run this again,\nyou might actually see that it gives you\n\n230\n00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.040\nanother version of a folder and\nyou download the newest version as well.\n\n231\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.750\nBut we're gonna use this one cuz it's\nalready done and we're ready to go, okay?\n\n232\n00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.550\nSo that's really all that you have to do.\n\n233\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.290\nNow on this machine,\nthis one is domain-joined, okay?\n\n234\n00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.810\nSo with this particular machine\nthat's domain-joined here,\n\n235\n00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.740\nI can choose whichever one that I want.\n\n236\n00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.850\nI just need to figure out which\nconfiguration I'm going to use.\n\n237\n00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.340\nSo let's go ahead and do this as the,\nwe'll do it as the current one.\n\n238\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.721\nJust so that we can prove that it ends up\nworking for us, is what we want to do.\n\n239\n00:14:41.721 --> 00:14:46.507\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, you had mentioned\npreviously about utilizing group\n\n240\n00:14:46.507 --> 00:14:50.780\npolicy to help push this out\nin a large environment there.\n\n241\n00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.370\nSo because this one is\na domain-joined computer,\n\n242\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.490\nthat would be another avenue\nwe could take as well?\n\n243\n00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.950\n&gt;&gt; You can take that to help you to\nconfigure certain things along that\n\n244\n00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:00.600\npath, right?\n\n245\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.360\nAnd again, you can also try to deploy it\nalong with the group policy settings, too.\n\n246\n00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.020\nBut this is, that's probably where\nyou'll run it,is as a script\n\n247\n00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.530\ninside of group policy is what\nyou'll end up doing to do this.\n\n248\n00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.360\nSo let me get back to the y drive,\nI closed out of it of course.\n\n249\n00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.430\nThat was just me being silly here.\n\n250\n00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:21.890\nSo now if I run setup.exe on\nthat particular computer,\n\n251\n00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.300\non this one, right,\nI want to now install it.\n\n252\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.410\nI wanna configure it\naccording to the XML file.\n\n253\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.410\nSo if I do configure and\n\n254\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.910\nthis is where I have to actually\nremember what the name of the file is.\n\n255\n00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.056\nSo let me do a dir here and\nthat will make it easier.\n\n256\n00:15:39.056 --> 00:15:43.738\nsetup/configure and then configo365 and\n\n257\n00:15:43.738 --> 00:15:49.626\nthen underscore and\nthen we'll do current for right now.\n\n258\n00:15:49.626 --> 00:15:50.331\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n259\n00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:53.746\n&gt;&gt; So we could choose that.\n\n260\n00:15:53.746 --> 00:15:58.290\nIf I wanted to run the regular one,\nI would just choose the config.xml.\n\n261\n00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.137\nAnd that is gonna begin the process.\n\n262\n00:16:01.137 --> 00:16:04.810\nNow, it'd be neat if they actually said,\nstarting install.\n\n263\n00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.884\nBut they really don't want\nanybody to see anything,\n\n264\n00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:11.653\nremember we chose the option to\nnot show anything here to do this.\n\n265\n00:16:11.653 --> 00:16:13.170\nSo, let's see.\n\n266\n00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.150\nWhat did I guess what I did?\n\n267\n00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.840\n&gt;&gt; What did you do?\n\n268\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.008\n&gt;&gt; No space is what I did.\n\n269\n00:16:19.008 --> 00:16:21.600\nI was like, why is this not working?\n\n270\n00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.022\nSo, let me actually do it correctly there.\n\n271\n00:16:25.022 --> 00:16:26.810\nLet me zoom in down here.\n\n272\n00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.810\nThat was just me being,\ntrying to type in very quickly.\n\n273\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:36.750\nSo, I need that space and now this time\nit's saying hey, your syntax was wrong.\n\n274\n00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.680\nSo it has config,\nyour package manager download.\n\n275\n00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.500\nSo, normally you would run the download\nfirst, make sure everything is done, and\n\n276\n00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.810\nthen you'd run this configure, okay?\n\n277\n00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.350\nOnce you do that, it's gonna use all\nthe settings in here to install it.\n\n278\n00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:54.194\nIf I right click on the task bar, select\ntask manager, when I should end up seeing,\n\n279\n00:16:54.194 --> 00:16:58.800\nand notice my CPU processor is\nrunning pretty high at this point.\n\n280\n00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.810\nIt's gonna continue to be that high\ncuz I have two gigs of ram running.\n\n281\n00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:08.860\nBut you can now see right here underneath\nthe Microsoft Office Click to Run,\n\n282\n00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:14.090\nit is taking up the majority of\nthe process here, about 50% of my CPU.\n\n283\n00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:18.290\nInstalling Office onto\nthis particular computer.\n\n284\n00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.450\nAnd being able to do this right.\n\n285\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.050\nSo it allows me to go ahead and run and\n\n286\n00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.400\ndo the install process and\nallow this to happen.\n\n287\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.109\nAt the same time, if there is a program\nthat has finished running at this point,\n\n288\n00:17:32.109 --> 00:17:35.363\nI don't even have to wait for\nthe rest of this install.\n\n289\n00:17:35.363 --> 00:17:36.826\nI always like to, okay,\n\n290\n00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:39.852\nbecause I always think-\n&gt;&gt; Just to make sure everything went well.\n\n291\n00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:41.277\n&gt;&gt; Just to make sure everything went well.\n\n292\n00:17:41.277 --> 00:17:42.125\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Overall though,\n\n293\n00:17:42.125 --> 00:17:45.369\nin the way that that clicked to run,\nand that's what you're looking for\n\n294\n00:17:45.369 --> 00:17:47.470\nright here, is Click To Run, okay?\n\n295\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.710\nWhenever you do something like that,\nif anything is now finished installing,\n\n296\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:56.540\nI should be able to see it over here,\nyep and it will start populating it in.\n\n297\n00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.862\nI know OneNote, I think, is there.\n\n298\n00:17:59.862 --> 00:18:02.640\nBut overall though,\nit's not actually done.\n\n299\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.580\nSo here, you won't actually see this, and\n\n300\n00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:09.050\nit shouldn't take a long time since I\nalready had the download already on here\n\n301\n00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.680\nbut, it still takes just a few\nminutes at least to run that.\n\n302\n00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.270\nNow while we're doing this right,\n\n303\n00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.420\nI want to show you the other one and\nthe way that that XML file looks.\n\n304\n00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.320\nLet me go back over here to where\nit actually physically resides\n\n305\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.230\non this machine.\n\n306\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.626\n&gt;&gt; So how is this different than what\nwe were looking at previously, Ronnie?\n\n307\n00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:34.042\n&gt;&gt; Now what you're actually looking at,\nso here's kind of the file that we were\n\n308\n00:18:34.042 --> 00:18:36.409\nusing except the difference\nhere would be differed,\n\n309\n00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:38.720\nI'm not gonna save this right now.\n\n310\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.180\nIs here is the one that I run on\nthis machine a little bit earlier.\n\n311\n00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.642\nSo that this way we can\nsee that if I wanted to,\n\n312\n00:18:48.642 --> 00:18:53.320\nI could actually limit what\ngets on this computer.\n\n313\n00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.570\nNow you might wonder,\nwhy the heck do I want to do this?\n\n314\n00:18:55.570 --> 00:19:00.720\nRemember not everybody might need access\nto things like a Groove or Info Pack.\n\n315\n00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.820\nI'm not saying they don't.\n\n316\n00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.360\nBut if you realize there's not\na lot of people using that.\n\n317\n00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.830\nWell, now look at the way that\nit's actually packaged here or\n\n318\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.430\nthe tag is says ExcludeApp.\n\n319\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.670\nSo not only are we actually saying,\n\n320\n00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:20.010\nhere's the Product ID, right,\nthat we actually are downloading from.\n\n321\n00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.132\nBut we're saying, in that Product ID,\n\n322\n00:19:24.132 --> 00:19:30.930\nwhen you do the configure,\nexclude these apps right here, okay?\n\n323\n00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:35.414\nAnd because, I don't know what every\nsingle one is, there are times,\n\n324\n00:19:35.414 --> 00:19:38.778\nthe only one I know that's\nmissing right now because I\n\n325\n00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:39.514\nchose it-\n&gt;&gt; Excel?\n\n326\n00:19:39.514 --> 00:19:43.520\n&gt;&gt; Is Excel,\nwhich means it should install Excel, okay?\n\n327\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.951\nSo at least, that's the one that's there.\n\n328\n00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:49.454\nBut if I actually have forgotten one,\nit will also end up installing as well.\n\n329\n00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:51.994\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then, you can manually remove it,\n\n330\n00:19:51.994 --> 00:19:56.672\nor if you want to you can add it back in\nand make sure that excludes it again,\n\n331\n00:19:56.672 --> 00:19:58.870\nif you wanna run through that.\n\n332\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.724\n&gt;&gt; As long as you stick with\nthat proper syntax that they.\n\n333\n00:20:00.724 --> 00:20:01.480\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah.\n\n334\n00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.480\nAs long as you stick with this,\nyou're pretty much ready to go.\n\n335\n00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.040\nAnd so this one, it didn't take longer\nthan a couple of minutes to run.\n\n336\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.550\nExcel got installed on this computer,\nand it was off and ready to go.\n\n337\n00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.340\nSo you can see Excel there and, let's see.\n\n338\n00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.611\nLet me see if I, I'm trying to see\nif I mangled anything else up.\n\n339\n00:20:18.611 --> 00:20:21.560\nIt looks like OneNote and\nOutlook got installed again.\n\n340\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.286\nSo I somehow missed that or\nI forgot about it.\n\n341\n00:20:24.286 --> 00:20:26.314\n&gt;&gt; Did you have them installed beforehand?\n\n342\n00:20:26.314 --> 00:20:28.070\n&gt;&gt; I did have them installed beforehand.\n\n343\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.500\nSo it could have been that\nit just left it behind.\n\n344\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.875\nNot the overall program, but\nthe link that's right there.\n\n345\n00:20:32.875 --> 00:20:34.240\nIt could have left it behind.\n\n346\n00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.300\nBut here it's clearly excluded both.\n\n347\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.930\nBut I think those links\nare actually dead if I take a look.\n\n348\n00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.620\nBut here,\nwe were actually able to do that.\n\n349\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.090\nSo not only can I manually control\nwhat I put on those computers, but\n\n350\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:49.960\nnow I can actually run that and\ndo that, too.\n\n351\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.040\nSo I have that ability,\nset it up, I'm trying to see,\n\n352\n00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.030\nit looks like it's down to 3% here.\n\n353\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.850\nAnd looks like the process\nis starting to go down.\n\n354\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.200\nSo now we wanna verify and see,\nif everything is almost done.\n\n355\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.840\nNow I can tell that it's not\ncompletely done installing yet,\n\n356\n00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.760\nbecause of what I told you here,\nis that when I see that cursor come back\n\n357\n00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.620\nto the actual prompt itself, just a y,\nthen I know it's completely done.\n\n358\n00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.770\nLet's see if everything is.\n\n359\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.890\nThere it goes.\n\n360\n00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.560\nNotice what's actually\ngetting added right now.\n\n361\n00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.010\nSo these things just popped up.\n\n362\n00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.960\nWord, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access.\n\n363\n00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.207\nAnd this one says new right\nhere because earlier,\n\n364\n00:21:29.207 --> 00:21:31.507\nwhen I was making sure that\nthis was working right,\n\n365\n00:21:31.507 --> 00:21:34.415\nI had installed everything else,\nbut you see where it says new.\n\n366\n00:21:34.415 --> 00:21:37.900\nSo I'd run those programs a little bit\nbefore, and so there's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n367\n00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.087\nLook, Excel is brand new,\nthat's showing up now.\n\n368\n00:21:40.087 --> 00:21:41.343\n&gt;&gt; That's what we were looking for.\n\n369\n00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:46.320\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and these Office 2016 tools.\n\n370\n00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.300\nSo this is actually installing OneNote,\nOutlook 2016,\n\n371\n00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.000\nPowerPoint there, Skype for Business.\n\n372\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.300\nIt is doing the install, Word right here,\n\n373\n00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.040\nall of that is actually brand\nnew to be able to do that.\n\n374\n00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.690\nNow, once I select, let's say here, Word.\n\n375\n00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.500\nI can run it, even though the install\nprocess is not completely done.\n\n376\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:16.070\nFrom this point, if I go to this\nblank document, and I select File.\n\n377\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.060\nAnd then Account,\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n378\n00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:29.392\nNotice right now were it says updates are\nautomatically downloaded and installed.\n\n379\n00:22:29.392 --> 00:22:32.600\nThis lets you know that this\nis the current version.\n\n380\n00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.740\nIf it says differed, it actually said\ndiffered here in terms of the updates.\n\n381\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.340\nIf you are not bound by\ngroup policy to change this,\n\n382\n00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.770\nyou might see where you can actually\nchange these options here instead\n\n383\n00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.990\nto disable or\nview the updates or update now.\n\n384\n00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:52.740\nSo, those are possibilities\nthat you also end up seeing for\n\n385\n00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.650\neverything else that you have to be\nable to do here when you take a look.\n\n386\n00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.500\nSo it's still running at those\npercentages, now it's down to zero.\n\n387\n00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.640\nAnd that should be changing here.\n\n388\n00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.560\nNow, the other thing that we also\nhave to think about, Cherokee,\n\n389\n00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.880\nin our last few minutes here,\nis to also think this idea and\n\n390\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.920\nwhat about those computers\nthat are not domain joined?\n\n391\n00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.119\nAll right, that we really are,\nit's saying, hey,\n\n392\n00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:20.190\nthis is gonna be on that computer.\n\n393\n00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.680\nCan we still do the manual\nupdates this way?\n\n394\n00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.920\nYou can do it in the exact same way.\n\n395\n00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.250\nYou can go ahead and\ninstall those as long as a person\n\n396\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.000\nhas their Office 365 account up and\nready to go.\n\n397\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.600\nWhen you install it on those computers, it\nshould not join the domain, but you should\n\n398\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.250\nsee that once they're done, it might\nask them to log in for the first time.\n\n399\n00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.748\nAnd once they do that,\nyou'll be able to do that as well.\n\n400\n00:23:43.748 --> 00:23:48.000\nSo that's really kind of the only\ndifferences that you will end up seeing.\n\n401\n00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.152\nNow that's the one file\nI do want to show and\n\n402\n00:23:51.152 --> 00:23:54.926\nalso make sure of,\nas we take a look at that folder.\n\n403\n00:23:54.926 --> 00:23:58.174\nLet me go back in here and\nsee it's not completely done yet.\n\n404\n00:23:58.174 --> 00:24:00.806\nBut let me go back over here in that way,\nso\n\n405\n00:24:00.806 --> 00:24:05.820\nhere was the other one I was gonna run,\nbut it's pretty much identical.\n\n406\n00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.460\n&gt;&gt; Just to check your other install?\n\n407\n00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.590\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so here when you take\na look at doing this deferred,\n\n408\n00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.970\nnotice here there is the channel\nas far as the updates go.\n\n409\n00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.620\nSo first release deferred, okay.\n\n410\n00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:26.820\nAnd that is something I definitely want\nto point out as far as the syntax goes\n\n411\n00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.800\nto get this thing right if you're gonna\ndo this through the configuration file.\n\n412\n00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.330\nIf you're changing this for testing for\nreleasing, this is something you\n\n413\n00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.720\ndefinitely want to make sure that\nyou do have a clear grasp on.\n\n414\n00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.650\nRemember that the other one is deferred,\nand\n\n415\n00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.740\nthen the other one of course is channel.\n\n416\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.410\nThose are kind of the key\nones that we really\n\n417\n00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.570\nwant to make sure that we\nunderstand in the syntax.\n\n418\n00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.930\nReview this syntax,\nespecially for this config file.\n\n419\n00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.170\nIt's really gonna help you out as well.\n\n420\n00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.630\nSo go back through, do a search in\nyour favorite search engine and\n\n421\n00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:03.490\ntype in configuration.XMLoptions and\nyou actually see that there's a whole\n\n422\n00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.830\nlist of them,\nalong with the product IDs for each one.\n\n423\n00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:11.210\nBut over here, on these update channels,\nit's very important\n\n424\n00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.370\nthat we really take a note of those and\nunderstand what those are all about.\n\n425\n00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.820\nSo once everything is done and finished,\nthat's what we'll do and of course then,\n\n426\n00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.162\nif you had your testing group,\nthis is what you need.\n\n427\n00:25:22.162 --> 00:25:24.810\nGoing to your testing group and\nyou do the same thing.\n\n428\n00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.010\nAnd you'll be off and ready to go as well.\n\n429\n00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.635\nSo it would just be a redundant\ndemo is what we would do.\n\n430\n00:25:29.635 --> 00:25:32.764\nThe only thing we would see different\nis in that update that I showed you,\n\n431\n00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:35.254\nit would just say, first release deferred-\n&gt;&gt; Changing it, yep.\n\n432\n00:25:35.254 --> 00:25:35.958\n&gt;&gt; That's all it would say.\n\n433\n00:25:35.958 --> 00:25:38.925\n&gt;&gt; Just a little bit of change\nof the syntax and, boy,\n\n434\n00:25:38.925 --> 00:25:40.860\nthat is pretty important there.\n\n435\n00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.030\nWe could even see that with\njust a little bit of mistype.\n\n436\n00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:47.282\nSo at least you do have the additional\ndocumentation to help you out if you\n\n437\n00:25:47.282 --> 00:25:50.010\nforget those IDs and\njust the overall syntax.\n\n438\n00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.660\nSo thank you Ronnie for\ntaking the time to demo that.\n\n439\n00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.002\nBut thank you ladies and gentlemen for\ntuning in, and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n440\n00:25:56.002 --> 00:25:57.022\nsign out for this show.\n\n441\n00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:59.600\nI'm gonna sign out

00:00:08.230\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.027\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:15.324\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your enabling\nOffice 365 Services series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:17.136\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:21.190\nIn this episode, we'll be looking\nat telemetry and reporting.\n\n8\n00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.740\nAnd with us today, in studio,\nis we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.090\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\nas we take a look at this aspect\n\n11\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.570\nof telemetry which of course,\ngives us a ton of data.\n\n12\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.940\nAnd then the reporting side of it so\nthat we can view the data, as well.\n\n13\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.410\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhat in the world is going on here?\n\n14\n00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.560\nWhy do we really need something like this?\n\n15\n00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.950\nIs kind of the key.\n\n16\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.880\nWhen we start to do this.\n\n17\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.460\nTelemetry can provide for organizations\n\n18\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.870\nthe data that they need especially\nwhen they're choosing to upgrade or\n\n19\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.200\nto migrate from maybe one\nversion of Office to another or\n\n20\n00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.400\nmaybe trying to migrate from something\ndifferent into Office as well.\n\n21\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.660\nAnd this is a key component of things\nthat we want to make sure that we can do.\n\n22\n00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.790\nOne of the hardest things right?\n\n23\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.070\nAs your business continues to grow and\nas you start to move in\n\n24\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.320\nthat direction where you just say hey,\nI think we need to move to Office 365 or\n\n25\n00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.730\nmove to 2016 whatever version\nyou might actually move from.\n\n26\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.390\nThe hard thing is to figure out\nwhat actually needs attention\n\n27\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.810\ninside of your network a lot of times.\n\n28\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.150\nSo the ability for us to say that we\ncan have something that monitors and\n\n29\n00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.570\nspits information back to us from\nour office users is gonna be key for\n\n30\n00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.810\nus to be able to do this.\n\n31\n00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.390\nNow, we can do it in\na couple of ways right?\n\n32\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.360\nThe manual way is fairly simple.\n\n33\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.820\nWe go to all of our Office users, and\nwe simply, as the IT department would say,\n\n34\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.500\nif you have any problems with Office at\nall, please make sure you shoot us and\n\n35\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.550\nemail and we'll try to take a look at it,\n\n36\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.420\nand see if it's something\nthat we can take care of.\n\n37\n00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.800\nAnd don't get me wrong,\n\n38\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.030\nthat's actually a pretty solid\nprocess if you want to do that.\n\n39\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.650\nBut the problem is,\nit can be inconsistent.\n\n40\n00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.220\nEven for one person, they might remember\nat the very beginning to do so but\n\n41\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.840\nthen after a period of time,\nthey stop remembering.\n\n42\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.150\nAnd they're still having the same issues.\n\n43\n00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.280\nThey just go on, nothing's really being\nresolved, so why even deal with it?\n\n44\n00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.680\nOr you have the other end extreme,\n\n45\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.070\nin which a person says I'm\nnot gonna worry about it.\n\n46\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.770\nIf it doesn't work, it doesn't work.\n\n47\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.170\nAnd so\nthey never report to you the problems.\n\n48\n00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.670\nSo in that sense,\nit can actually go from those extremes.\n\n49\n00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.330\nSo you get very uneven\namounts of data that come in.\n\n50\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.382\nEspecially when you're trying to go is\nthis worth us actually making the move to\n\n51\n00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:45.475\ndo things like that.\n\n52\n00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:52.420\nWell, the great thing is, especially if\nyou're starting to run in Office 2016.\n\n53\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.820\nThe Office telemetry data\nis already there, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.365\nSo in other words, in the background,\nOffice 2016 goes ahead and\n\n55\n00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:05.757\ninstalls in everything to allow for\nthe telemetry data to be there,\n\n56\n00:03:05.757 --> 00:03:09.580\nfor us to be able to gather and\npull up as we need to.\n\n57\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.100\nOkay, so that's something that we really\nwant to make sure that we understand.\n\n58\n00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.980\nAnd because once we actually can\ndetermine what it is we need to monitor,\n\n59\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.530\nit helps an organization to minimize risk.\n\n60\n00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.000\nWe might realize, we might not\nbe able to do what we want to.\n\n61\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.060\nWe might actually have to kind of\nhold off on that a little bit more.\n\n62\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.191\nIt actually may give us that ability\nto just take a little bit more time and\n\n63\n00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:33.660\nunderstanding what we also see.\n\n64\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.080\nThe other thing of course that can help us\nout with the idea of office telemetry is,\n\n65\n00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.860\neven though we can monitor it a computer\nat a time by going into event viewer and\n\n66\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.820\nlooking at the logs on\nevery single computer.\n\n67\n00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.830\nThe telemetry or office telemetry\ngives us the ability to collate and\n\n68\n00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.230\ngather all that data and\nhave it report to a single location.\n\n69\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.280\nAnd then using a single interface.\n\n70\n00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.180\nWe can pull all that data up and\nsee that, and\n\n71\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.320\nthat way we can analyze it\nacross our entire domain.\n\n72\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.950\n&gt;&gt; Find any kind of correlations or\n\n73\n00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.880\ntrends with particular issues that our\ncustomers or employees may be having.\n\n74\n00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it is something that we\nreally have to pay attention to.\n\n75\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.150\nBecause you're no longer\ntalking about maybe\n\n76\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.660\nbuying just a number of licenses anymore,\nand seeing it works.\n\n77\n00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.900\nWhat you're actually trying to do,\n\n78\n00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.910\nis make sure that before you make a big\njump into anything, that you have\n\n79\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.030\nall of the relevant data on hand, so that\nyou can make a proper business decision.\n\n80\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.110\nAnd all this comes out to\ndifferent business factors.\n\n81\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.837\nBut really Microsoft's idea of trying\nto reduce what they call the total\n\n82\n00:04:41.837 --> 00:04:46.116\ncost of ownership, giving you the tools\nthat are ready and available right there,\n\n83\n00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:49.719\nseeing if that can actually fix and\ndo everything that you need it to and\n\n84\n00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.033\nit gives us what we need.\n\n85\n00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:56.208\nSo, one of the first that we want\nto be able to do here then is to,\n\n86\n00:04:56.208 --> 00:05:02.387\nstart setting up for this telemetry\nservice to work the way that we need to.\n\n87\n00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:04.764\nNow when you start to talk about that,\n\n88\n00:05:04.764 --> 00:05:10.130\nthere's many elements that are actually\ninvolved when we start to do this.\n\n89\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.750\nThere is something that we call,\nof course, actually let me bring up\n\n90\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.870\na diagram for us if I can actually\nget to the right diagram here.\n\n91\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.960\nAnd that should help us out a little\nbit more when we bring this up here.\n\n92\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.290\nSo I want the diagram for the telemetry\ndata which is gonna be right here.\n\n93\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.800\nI forgot to pull this up\nright before the show, so\n\n94\n00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.400\nthis should actually bring it up for us.\n\n95\n00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.770\nAnd then we'll be able to see what\nwe normally need to do here okay?\n\n96\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.020\nSo, in part of the process, that we\nare actually going to take a look at,\n\n97\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.560\nis understand components that\nare actually involved in\n\n98\n00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.397\nthe telemetry aspect of what we do, okay.\n\n99\n00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.860\nSo over on the client side,\nover here on the left hand side,\n\n100\n00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.080\noffice telemetry data itself is\ncollected by different telemetry agents.\n\n101\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.610\nNow in Office 2016,\nyou don't have to install anything else.\n\n102\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.580\nIt's actually installed for\nyou when you go ahead and you download and\n\n103\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.120\nyou install Office 2016.\n\n104\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.340\nBut in Office 2013, you would have\nactually had to install something and\n\n105\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.650\nthe previous editions before that,\n\n106\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.160\nyou'd have to manually deploy an actual\nagent on each one of those clients.\n\n107\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.780\nAnd we would normally do that either\nthrough modifying the registry or\n\n108\n00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.360\nwe would actually do that\nthrough group policy.\n\n109\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.240\nGroup policy usually the preferred\nmethod to do this, okay.\n\n110\n00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.570\nThe other things that also needs to\nbe created is a centralized share\n\n111\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:41.360\nwhere all of those different office agents\nthat are out there, can send their data\n\n112\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.380\ninto that particular share so\nit can be collated in one place, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.400\nOnce they have that particular share and\nall that data's there,\n\n114\n00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.770\nit is then sent to what we call\na telemetry processor, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.645\nThe telemetry processor then,\ncollates that data gets it ready to\n\n116\n00:07:00.645 --> 00:07:05.184\nbe able to connect into putting\nit in the form that it needs to.\n\n117\n00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:08.064\n&gt;&gt; The correct format?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and what it's actually doing is\n\n118\n00:07:08.064 --> 00:07:13.410\nit's processing it and putting it into\nwhat we call a telemetry database.\n\n119\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.840\nNow, this database,\ndepending on what you're doing, okay.\n\n120\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.230\nIt can be very large or\nit can be very small.\n\n121\n00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.850\nSo for example, you're running this in\nan organization that's continuing to grow,\n\n122\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.890\nyou might be installing SQL Server 2014,\n2016,\n\n123\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:36.230\nwhatever the latest version of SQL is that\ncan handle a tremendous amount of data.\n\n124\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.780\nIf you're doing this in\na testing environment.\n\n125\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.290\nYou can probably run like SQL Express.\n\n126\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.830\nA smaller, lighter weight edition of this,\nto just give you some sample\n\n127\n00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.790\ndata as you're actually getting everything\nset up the way that you want to.\n\n128\n00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.613\nBut it requires all these\nelements to be there.\n\n129\n00:07:53.613 --> 00:07:57.985\nNow depending on the number of users\nthat you have available to you or\n\n130\n00:07:57.985 --> 00:08:00.100\nhow this is gonna run.\n\n131\n00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.828\nYou may not actually install\nthis all on one machine.\n\n132\n00:08:03.828 --> 00:08:07.041\nIn our environment it's really\nonly three machines, okay,\n\n133\n00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:09.820\ntwo machines overall at this point, okay.\n\n134\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.360\nSo I actually have everything\nrunning on one server.\n\n135\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.420\nAnd it does require at least 4 gigs of\nram and at least 11 gigs of free space\n\n136\n00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.640\nto run the Telemetry database,\nno, yeah, the database, yeah.\n\n137\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.500\nAnd that's, I'm trying to think if that's\nright, just the database itself for\n\n138\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.600\njust the testing environment here.\n\n139\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.590\nAnd that unusual number about\n11 gigs is actually kind of,\n\n140\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.720\nit's based off of math in\na particular way here.\n\n141\n00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.637\nFor example If you're running Office 2016,\nthe Telemetry data\n\n142\n00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:46.225\nitself that every client actually\nsends is about 64 K of data.\n\n143\n00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:50.840\nOkay, now you have about 10,000\nusers over a period of a year,\n\n144\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.700\nit equals around 10 or 11 gigs.\n\n145\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.068\nSo I'm not saying the exact math,\nbut it equals around that.\n\n146\n00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:57.792\nAnd that's why they start off this way.\n\n147\n00:08:57.792 --> 00:09:01.940\nIt's like you have to have at least 11\ngigs because they realize something that\n\n148\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.402\nin a year's time, if you have 10,000\nusers, that's really gonna expand out.\n\n149\n00:09:06.402 --> 00:09:11.000\nAnd that's gonna be minimum, so\nthat's gonna be the key here.\n\n150\n00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000\nNow you mix that with like Office 2010 And\nOffice earlier legacy versions.\n\n151\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.550\nThose are only like 50k of data as well.\n\n152\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.180\nBut as you mix all that together and you\nstart doing that, that's a lot of data.\n\n153\n00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.390\nAnd that's why we get that free space\nrequirement that we're talking about too.\n\n154\n00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.240\nSo notice that you have to have,\n\n155\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.480\nwell, these elements right here to\nbe able to run what we want to.\n\n156\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:41.000\nThe last element is the reporting element\nwhich is our Telemetry Dashboard.\n\n157\n00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.120\nIt just went, Cherokee,\n\n158\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.980\nwe were making fun that Cherokee\ncouldn't say Telemetry earlier.\n\n159\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.710\nI apparently can't say it today.\n\n160\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:52.163\nSo Telemetry Dashboard is\nan Excel spreadsheet that\n\n161\n00:09:52.163 --> 00:09:57.121\nallows me to pull the data from\nthat Telemetry database and\n\n162\n00:09:57.121 --> 00:10:02.786\nreport it in a way that allows me to\nmake good decisions on whether or\n\n163\n00:10:02.786 --> 00:10:09.596\nnot we're proceeding forward with things\nand what I'm actually looking for.\n\n164\n00:10:09.596 --> 00:10:13.984\nIt can even offer guidance in terms of\nhow to correct certain elements that\n\n165\n00:10:13.984 --> 00:10:17.190\npresent solutions and\nwhen that actually does this.\n\n166\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.140\nFor example, like in group policy,\nit goes hey,\n\n167\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.640\nthis is what you need to\nenable to fix this here.\n\n168\n00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.490\nIt will actually not just leave us and\ntell us to go to group policy and fix it.\n\n169\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.330\nIt will actually run and generate for\n\n170\n00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:34.910\nus an actual PowerShell script, I was\ntrying to remember what it was called.\n\n171\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.500\nPowerShell script to help us to be\nable to actually fix the problems\n\n172\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.980\nthat we're also seeing and facing.\n\n173\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.916\nSo all these elements that we have here\nwhen we start to take a look, that's what\n\n174\n00:10:46.916 --> 00:10:51.573\nit normally requires for us to be able to\nrun and to be able to do what need to.\n\n175\n00:10:51.573 --> 00:10:56.790\nNow you're going okay, so\nhow do I begin to set all this up?\n\n176\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.640\n&gt;&gt; Do we set it up?\n\n177\n00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.800\nIs it an interactive type install or?\n\n178\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.509\n&gt;&gt; It's both.\n\n179\n00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:01.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n180\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.330\nSo depending on how you\nchoose to start here, but\n\n181\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.500\nif you understand what the elements are,\nyou can manually set it up yourself, and\n\n182\n00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.240\nsave a little bit of time.\n\n183\n00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.470\nBut let's say that we don't know\nexactly how to begin at all.\n\n184\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.592\n&gt;&gt; We can say that honestly.\n\n185\n00:11:16.592 --> 00:11:17.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because I don't.\n\n186\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.870\n&gt;&gt; Let's say that we don't\nreally know how to begin.\n\n187\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.960\nSo this is the way that we begin.\n\n188\n00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.568\nOkay, if you have Office installed,\nthe Telemetry Dashboard, and even\n\n189\n00:11:27.568 --> 00:11:32.740\nthe log settings are already downloaded\nand installed onto your computer.\n\n190\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.800\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n191\n00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.845\nSo here it is,\nI'm actually on the server here and\n\n192\n00:11:37.845 --> 00:11:40.902\nI've done a deployment of\nOffice on this server.\n\n193\n00:11:40.902 --> 00:11:43.379\nI've actually only done one program,\nwhich was Excel,\n\n194\n00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:45.350\nbecause that's the one\nthat I know I needed.\n\n195\n00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:54.370\nSo once I install Office for at least that\nprogram, I can click on the Start button.\n\n196\n00:11:54.370 --> 00:12:00.068\nAnd then what I'm looking for\nhere is not Excel directly.\n\n197\n00:12:00.068 --> 00:12:05.010\nBut actually right here,\nMicrosoft Office Tools, 2016 tools.\n\n198\n00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.650\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, you said you installed\nExcel because you knew that's the one\n\n199\n00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.160\nyou needed.\n\n200\n00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:16.630\nSo in this aspect, is our Excel program\ngonna be acting as a mini database?\n\n201\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.080\nOr why is that a requirement?\n\n202\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.240\n&gt;&gt; It's a requirement\nbecause the dashboard itself,\n\n203\n00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.620\nit won't see the information.\n\n204\n00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.280\nIt has to come through\nthat Excel spreadsheet.\n\n205\n00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.210\nSo without Excel, I'm not gonna be able\nto see it, that's what it comes down to.\n\n206\n00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:34.030\nNow, will you actually be able,\nif I decided to do the Office install,\n\n207\n00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.060\nwould the Telemetry database or\nthis dashboard disappear?\n\n208\n00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.310\nIt wouldn't disappear,\nit just wouldn't be connected to Excel.\n\n209\n00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.020\nIt'd just be a file that\nwould be sitting there like,\n\n210\n00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.740\nokay, what do you want me to open with?\n\n211\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.020\nYou don't have any program\nthat actually does that.\n\n212\n00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.240\nSo that's why we needed that.\n\n213\n00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.510\nSo right here in this\nTelemetry Dashboard for\n\n214\n00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:56.010\nOffice, that is pretty much the one\nthat we are going to focus in on.\n\n215\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:00.860\nThe reason why we want to start here,\nI'll show you, is I'm gonna click on this.\n\n216\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.610\nAnd since I'm just running\nit from the servers,\n\n217\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.790\nactually the easiest connection I can\nmake and that's why I chose this one.\n\n218\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.460\nNotice it gives me a Dashboard guide.\n\n219\n00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.942\nBut what I'm really looking for\nis not so much this guidance here.\n\n220\n00:13:12.942 --> 00:13:17.080\nBut I just kinda showed you like this\ninside of my simple diagram where it goes\n\n221\n00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.701\nfrom the agent to the shared folder\nto the processor, database and\n\n222\n00:13:20.701 --> 00:13:22.010\nTelemetry Dashboard.\n\n223\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.030\nKind of shows you the same thing just\na little bit more on my style, and\n\n224\n00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.010\nhow I did that.\n\n225\n00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:31.080\nBut what I'm really looking for is right\nhere, okay, where it says Getting started.\n\n226\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.990\nWell, Cherokee, if there's anything that-\n&gt;&gt; Pretty Straightforward.\n\n227\n00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.860\n&gt;&gt; Probably help me out it would\nbe where it says Getting started.\n\n228\n00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.190\nSo this is where you\nhave this ability then\n\n229\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:46.020\nto see if you actually do\nmeet the requirements here.\n\n230\n00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.590\nSo the great thing is you simply\nwalk through the set up here.\n\n231\n00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.550\nThe Getting started and\nthe set of prerequisites.\n\n232\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.750\nTelemetry Dashboard requires\nan existing installation of SQL server.\n\n233\n00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.480\nMust have permission to create new\ndatabase or an existing database.\n\n234\n00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.650\nYou can install SQL Express\nif you don't have this.\n\n235\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:08.420\nSo notice that, my gosh I got to go and\nfind what version of SQL do I need?\n\n236\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.100\nWhat do I need to do here?\n\n237\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.350\nYou don't have to worry about it,\n\n238\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.970\nyou just simply click on this link and\nthere you go.\n\n239\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.980\n&gt;&gt; So if you already installed\nSQL Express on this machine.\n\n240\n00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.520\n&gt;&gt; I have already installed\nSQL Express on this machine,\n\n241\n00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.880\nbecause I already knew that\nthis was a requirement.\n\n242\n00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.950\nBut yes, you can install it.\n\n243\n00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.750\nSQL express does take a bit\nof time to install, so\n\n244\n00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.880\nfollow the instructions through.\n\n245\n00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.960\nAnd make sure you understand\nhere when it says,\n\n246\n00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.470\nyou must have permissions to create\na new database or use an existing one.\n\n247\n00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.140\nThe creation of the new database is kind\nof the key, and as you go through and\n\n248\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.020\ndo that, that's where you do that.\n\n249\n00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.960\nNow the great thing is once you actually\nrun through it the wizard kind of helps\n\n250\n00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.030\nyou out.\n\n251\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.290\nThe key here is to pick\na name that you'll know and\n\n252\n00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.960\nunderstand is kinda the key, okay.\n\n253\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.388\nSo once you have that you're ready to go.\n\n254\n00:14:54.388 --> 00:14:55.901\n&gt;&gt; A name for the database?\n\n255\n00:14:55.901 --> 00:14:58.930\n&gt;&gt; Name for the database, yeah,\nis what you're actually gonna see.\n\n256\n00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:04.060\nThe next one of course is installing\nthe Telemetry processor, okay.\n\n257\n00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.970\nSo the Telemetry processor collects\nthe data from the actual shared folder,\n\n258\n00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.750\nimports it into the database itself.\n\n259\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.750\nSo remember that when the clients\nare actually set up to do this,\n\n260\n00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.160\nthe clients by themselves.\n\n261\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.130\nWhen they start generating\nthis type of Telemetry data,\n\n262\n00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:26.370\nwhich of course includes usage data and\nsome of the different things, ownership.\n\n263\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.667\nNow anything that actually affects\nthe program itself whether you opened it,\n\n264\n00:15:30.667 --> 00:15:32.100\nerrors all that stuff.\n\n265\n00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.590\nIt will collect that information, and\n\n266\n00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.990\nit will even collect information\nabout the files that you're using and\n\n267\n00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.810\nare you actually experiencing\nany problems with that.\n\n268\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:44.070\nIt will do that and it collects it\nlocally at the beginning, okay.\n\n269\n00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:49.280\nNow once it collects it locally at the\nbeginning For us to actually be able to do\n\n270\n00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.600\nmore with that such as getting\nit into that shared folder.\n\n271\n00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.080\nWe have to get it redirected there.\n\n272\n00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.803\nOkay, it's not gonna automatically just\nsend it up There has to be a way we tell\n\n273\n00:15:59.803 --> 00:16:02.462\nit that it's gonna send\nit up there to do so.\n\n274\n00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:05.762\nAnd this is where we start enabling\nlogging and we tell it where to go, so\n\n275\n00:16:05.762 --> 00:16:07.529\nwe've got a couple of options there.\n\n276\n00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:12.296\nInside of an Active Directory network,\nthe best way to do this is\n\n277\n00:16:12.296 --> 00:16:16.994\ninstead to go into group policy and\nenable it there too, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:16.994 --> 00:16:19.181\nSo that's what you're actually gonna,\ndo, and\n\n279\n00:16:19.181 --> 00:16:22.417\nwe're gonna show you at least some of\nthat as we go on through here, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:22.417 --> 00:16:26.308\nNow, if I know that I'm gonna install on\nthis computer I simply follow this link\n\n281\n00:16:26.308 --> 00:16:27.073\nalong, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:32.320\nAnd then it just runs through a wizard,\nand it tells me exactly what to do next.\n\n283\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.132\nBut let's say that we're downloading this,\nand I don't want to install it on this\n\n284\n00:16:36.132 --> 00:16:39.844\ncomputer but I have another server that I\nsaid I'll set it up to dedicate to that.\n\n285\n00:16:39.844 --> 00:16:45.161\nBut I want to install it there instead.\n\n286\n00:16:45.161 --> 00:16:48.947\nIt gives you the ability to\ndownload either one of these two,\n\n287\n00:16:48.947 --> 00:16:51.853\nto install on that separate computer,\nokay?\n\n288\n00:16:51.853 --> 00:16:54.244\nSo there is says save the X86 or\n\n289\n00:16:54.244 --> 00:16:59.480\nthe X64 that is based on the operating\nsystem architecture itself.\n\n290\n00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.032\nDon't worry about the Office install,\nin other words,\n\n291\n00:17:03.032 --> 00:17:05.778\ndon't select the 380 or the X86 here.\n\n292\n00:17:05.778 --> 00:17:11.478\n&gt;&gt; If you have a 32 bit Office install\nrunning on a 64 bit architecture.\n\n293\n00:17:11.478 --> 00:17:15.826\n&gt;&gt; Right, so make sure you actually\nselect the one that's based on\n\n294\n00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:18.253\nthe system architecture instead.\n\n295\n00:17:18.253 --> 00:17:20.775\nAnd that's kinda the key\nif you're gonna do this,\n\n296\n00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:24.074\nthis is based on the operating\nsystem one instead, if you do that.\n\n297\n00:17:24.074 --> 00:17:26.706\nBut if you select this and\nyou install the telemetry processor,\n\n298\n00:17:26.706 --> 00:17:29.891\nI don't think it's gonna hurt if I\ninstall it, let's see what it does here.\n\n299\n00:17:29.891 --> 00:17:33.601\nSo I'm just selecting to install\nit on this one and notice that it\n\n300\n00:17:33.601 --> 00:17:37.809\nactually chose for me and that's kinda\nthe benefit of this, if you can.\n\n301\n00:17:37.809 --> 00:17:43.309\nIf you're not sure, it already knows\nhow to see on your computer and\n\n302\n00:17:43.309 --> 00:17:45.634\nwhich one that you have too.\n\n303\n00:17:45.634 --> 00:17:49.052\nNow the other great thing is, if you\nchoose the wrong one it's gonna tell you\n\n304\n00:17:49.052 --> 00:17:51.509\nright away and say hey,\nthis is not the right version,\n\n305\n00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:54.678\nmake sure you get the other one, and\nit will actually let you install.\n\n306\n00:17:54.678 --> 00:17:57.558\nFrom here you just simply click Next and\n\n307\n00:17:57.558 --> 00:18:02.805\nthen from that point it says to run\nthose settings now, I click Finish.\n\n308\n00:18:02.805 --> 00:18:06.084\nAnd then it begins this process\nhere where it says hey,\n\n309\n00:18:06.084 --> 00:18:09.791\nyou need to connect to the SQL database,\nyou need to connect or\n\n310\n00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:12.734\ncreate a shared folder as\nwell as you do all this.\n\n311\n00:18:12.734 --> 00:18:15.996\nThe great thing is we've already done some\nof these, so I'm not gonna worry about it.\n\n312\n00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:19.151\nBut notice it's really this\ntwo step process here,\n\n313\n00:18:19.151 --> 00:18:22.162\nthat once you have it\nconnect to the SQL database,\n\n314\n00:18:22.162 --> 00:18:26.914\nmake sure you have a shared folder,\nif you don't have a shared folder, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:26.914 --> 00:18:30.640\nIt will kind of create it for\nyou as you go through this wizard,\n\n316\n00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.300\nyou'll be able to do that.\n\n317\n00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:37.143\nNow, the key here is, if you\nare gonna use this as a shared folder\n\n318\n00:18:37.143 --> 00:18:42.078\nto collect telemetry data,\nI would caution you not to use a folder\n\n319\n00:18:42.078 --> 00:18:46.139\nthat has data in it,\ncuz it tells you when you do this.\n\n320\n00:18:46.139 --> 00:18:49.660\nThat if you do that, all that datas\nare gonna be overwritten out,\n\n321\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.016\nit's gonna disappear.\n\n322\n00:18:51.016 --> 00:18:55.647\nSo if you choose to do this, make sure\nyou actually choose to do this and\n\n323\n00:18:55.647 --> 00:18:57.778\ncreate your own shared folder.\n\n324\n00:18:57.778 --> 00:19:00.239\n&gt;&gt; I guess that's your warning,\nwarning signal there.\n\n325\n00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:03.518\nNot too much, if you're just trying\nto get through that really fast,\n\n326\n00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:04.581\nhitting Next, Next.\n\n327\n00:19:04.581 --> 00:19:05.197\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n328\n00:19:05.197 --> 00:19:06.312\n&gt;&gt; Something you could overlook.\n\n329\n00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:09.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually something that\nyou definitely want to pay attention to as\n\n330\n00:19:09.555 --> 00:19:10.073\nyou do that.\n\n331\n00:19:10.073 --> 00:19:13.961\nSo if I select there, notice so\nhere, where it says hey,\n\n332\n00:19:13.961 --> 00:19:15.665\nare you going to do this?\n\n333\n00:19:15.665 --> 00:19:19.624\nWell, because this is installed on the\nsame machine, it's very easy connection.\n\n334\n00:19:19.624 --> 00:19:24.142\nNow, if you actually have this on\na different machine, then where your\n\n335\n00:19:24.142 --> 00:19:29.513\nSQL Server is gonna be you have to set up\nthe authentication stuff correctly, okay?\n\n336\n00:19:29.513 --> 00:19:33.573\nNow, this is not a SQL show so we're not\ndoing that right now, but we're simply\n\n337\n00:19:33.573 --> 00:19:37.706\ngonna use kind of the easiest install at\nthis point just to prove our connection.\n\n338\n00:19:37.706 --> 00:19:42.176\nWe select connect and now it's\ngonna say what's the database, and\n\n339\n00:19:42.176 --> 00:19:45.323\nI'm gonna select the 0365 database here.\n\n340\n00:19:45.323 --> 00:19:48.701\nIf I wanted to create a new one,\nI could do that.\n\n341\n00:19:48.701 --> 00:19:53.650\nNotice that all I have to do is\nkind of re-type in another one, so\n\n342\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:59.257\nnow let me do it this way instead,\n0365a just as an example, right?\n\n343\n00:19:59.257 --> 00:20:00.420\nThat's different, and\n\n344\n00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.750\nthis will go through and create a brand\nnew database in my SQL database.\n\n345\n00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.919\nNow if you're not sure what that means,\nit'll create the file structure.\n\n346\n00:20:06.919 --> 00:20:08.475\nIt'll create the shared views.\n\n347\n00:20:08.475 --> 00:20:11.536\nIt'll create all of the table\nstructure to be ready to\n\n348\n00:20:11.536 --> 00:20:14.675\naccept the data that the processor\nis gonna send to it.\n\n349\n00:20:14.675 --> 00:20:19.958\nSo that's all it's gonna do if I chose to\ndo something like this right here, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:23.090\nSo you simply click Create, and\n\n351\n00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.737\nnow it's going to go ahead and\ncreate it for me.\n\n352\n00:20:27.737 --> 00:20:30.826\nSo it does take a little bit of time and\nit probably takes a little bit more time\n\n353\n00:20:30.826 --> 00:20:34.368\nsince I told it to create from didn't take\ntoo much time at all, so that's great.\n\n354\n00:20:34.368 --> 00:20:35.799\nSometimes it takes longer,\n\n355\n00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:39.442\ndepends on all the other stuff that\nyou're doing in the background too.\n\n356\n00:20:39.442 --> 00:20:43.888\nClick Next and now it asks for\nthese permissions.\n\n357\n00:20:43.888 --> 00:20:47.710\nIf you manually know how to go\ninto SQL and set permissions,\n\n358\n00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.628\nyou can do it that way, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:49.628 --> 00:20:52.755\nBut if you don't, notice this actually,\ngoing to go ahead and\n\n360\n00:20:52.755 --> 00:20:56.060\nconfigure the correct permissions for\nus, which is kind of nice.\n\n361\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.267\n&gt;&gt; I like how that sounds, yeah.\n\n362\n00:20:57.267 --> 00:20:59.455\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It means that we really don't have to\n\n363\n00:20:59.455 --> 00:21:01.215\nknow much about installing SQL, right?\n\n364\n00:21:01.215 --> 00:21:06.093\nAnd getting everything up and running, and\ntrying to become SQL masters at the same\n\n365\n00:21:06.093 --> 00:21:09.943\ntime or the SQL database master,\nI should say, at the same time.\n\n366\n00:21:09.943 --> 00:21:13.844\nNow if your ears are twitching\nbecause I keep saying SQL,\n\n367\n00:21:13.844 --> 00:21:19.223\nit is the Microsoft SQL Server, but if\nyou really want me to I can say SQL, too.\n\n368\n00:21:19.223 --> 00:21:22.567\nBut overall, though,\njust kind of remember that's it, too.\n\n369\n00:21:22.567 --> 00:21:27.550\nSo you want to configure this with\nthe proper permissions, I'll say Yes.\n\n370\n00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:32.450\nAnd here is the actual shared path that\nwe are gonna end up using as well.\n\n371\n00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:38.154\nSo specify the UNC path of an existing\nfolder to collect the stored data,\n\n372\n00:21:38.154 --> 00:21:43.502\nto create a new, to create and\nshare a folder on the local computer.\n\n373\n00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:46.892\nHere is the warning, okay, right?\n\n374\n00:21:46.892 --> 00:21:53.034\nThis folder is exclusive use by the\nOffice Telemetry Processor and the Agent.\n\n375\n00:21:53.034 --> 00:21:56.343\nAll other files stored in\nthis folder will be deleted.\n\n376\n00:21:56.343 --> 00:22:02.590\nSo if I have a folder and I don't\nknow if I do or not, I wanna check.\n\n377\n00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:07.016\nSo I know it's kind of weird but-\n&gt;&gt; What if there's\n\n378\n00:22:07.016 --> 00:22:11.183\na particular file that has the same\nUNC path or the same file name.\n\n379\n00:22:11.183 --> 00:22:14.218\nYeah, you definitely wanna check\nthat first, at least I would think.\n\n380\n00:22:14.218 --> 00:22:17.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you definitely do,\nbut if you're like me and\n\n381\n00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:21.418\nyou create shared folders quite often,\nand you kind of delete them quite often,\n\n382\n00:22:21.418 --> 00:22:24.204\nyou tend to rename them the same things,\nlike I do.\n\n383\n00:22:24.204 --> 00:22:29.100\nAnd so I don't know if there's actually\nany time that there's another folder,\n\n384\n00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.697\nand I might have actually\nput some data in.\n\n385\n00:22:31.697 --> 00:22:36.187\nSo, I actually realized I don't have\nanything there that's called telemetry\n\n386\n00:22:36.187 --> 00:22:38.604\nlet me actually,\nI went to the wrong folder.\n\n387\n00:22:38.604 --> 00:22:43.179\nLet me see here on local disk C, so\nthere is actually nothing right here.\n\n388\n00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:50.203\nBut if I wanted to, let me browse and let\nme scoot around this and put it this way.\n\n389\n00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:54.157\nCuz I really want to name it here,\n\n390\n00:22:54.157 --> 00:23:00.245\nI want it in my shared folder,\ntelemetry instead.\n\n391\n00:23:03.359 --> 00:23:07.505\nSelect that one and\nnow it's gonna be in that folder.\n\n392\n00:23:07.505 --> 00:23:09.740\nI already shared out the Office 365,\n\n393\n00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.893\nwhich means they'll be able to get\naccess to this one as well, click Next.\n\n394\n00:23:13.893 --> 00:23:18.741\nAnd meet once again, I don't have to be\nan expert at file sharing either, right,\n\n395\n00:23:18.741 --> 00:23:20.022\nat sharing folders.\n\n396\n00:23:20.022 --> 00:23:23.431\nIt just says hey,\nit needs to be shared with permissions,\n\n397\n00:23:23.431 --> 00:23:26.760\nset to allow inventory data\nto be stored in this folder.\n\n398\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.780\nThe wizard will grant authenticated\nusers the ability to create files,\n\n399\n00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.590\nwrite data in the shared folder without\nbeing able to browse the contents.\n\n400\n00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.640\nThat's pretty good, that means\nnobody else can come in here and\n\n401\n00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.576\njust browse anybody else's telemetry data.\n\n402\n00:23:41.576 --> 00:23:45.387\nWe can actually have all that set up for\nus which is really great.\n\n403\n00:23:45.387 --> 00:23:48.789\nCuz for me I hate to say it, I'd\nprobably just let everybody come in but\n\n404\n00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:50.065\nthat's not what we want.\n\n405\n00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:54.060\nSo we'll go ahead and use that,\nand then at this point of course,\n\n406\n00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.470\ndo you want to be a part of this program?\n\n407\n00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.322\nI'm just gonna select no, I don't want to.\n\n408\n00:23:59.322 --> 00:24:03.620\nYou're more than welcome to, but, for\nme, I'm just gonna select Next here.\n\n409\n00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.265\nAnd it tells me that\neverything has actually been\n\n410\n00:24:06.265 --> 00:24:07.820\nset up the way that I want to.\n\n411\n00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:14.619\nAll right, so, from this point,\nwe go on to step number three.\n\n412\n00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:18.074\nNow, in step number three here,\non this telemetry agent,\n\n413\n00:24:18.074 --> 00:24:19.950\nyou've got to be careful here.\n\n414\n00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:24.550\nBecause what it's asking is,\nare you actually going to be running\n\n415\n00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.440\nany of these computers running\nOffice 2003, 2007, or 2010?\n\n416\n00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:35.480\nIf you're not gonna do this, you can\nskip this particular step here, okay?\n\n417\n00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.667\nBut if you are, and you need to deploy\nthis particular Telemetry Agent,\n\n418\n00:24:40.667 --> 00:24:43.058\nthis is the place to do so, okay?\n\n419\n00:24:43.058 --> 00:24:45.250\nSo, you go ahead, and you download this.\n\n420\n00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:50.650\nAnd then you run it on your previous\nedition of Office to be able to do this.\n\n421\n00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:55.918\nNotice 2013 is not in this list, but\n2010, 2007, 2003, you will collect that.\n\n422\n00:24:55.918 --> 00:25:01.386\nNow, there is a limitation when you start\nto do this with the older versions.\n\n423\n00:25:01.386 --> 00:25:05.975\nIt will still report to you the usage\ndata, and some of the other data.\n\n424\n00:25:05.975 --> 00:25:09.573\nBut it won't report to you any data\nabout using the files inside, so\n\n425\n00:25:09.573 --> 00:25:12.300\nyou won't get that type of information.\n\n426\n00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:16.060\nSo not as detailed, but at least\nit will give you that information.\n\n427\n00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.200\n&gt;&gt; So, that's going to be for,\nlet me see which versions,\n\n428\n00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.880\nI'm trying to think,\nwe've got Office 2003, 2007.\n\n429\n00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.420\nWe're not allowed to use them or\nit's just gonna be limited?\n\n430\n00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.370\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be limited.\n\n431\n00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:31.350\nSo as long as you can deploy\nthis agent onto those machines,\n\n432\n00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.640\nit will let you do so, okay?\n\n433\n00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.980\nSo you'll get a little bit of data, but\nnot as much, and not as rich of a data\n\n434\n00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.160\nstream as you actually get inside of 2016-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n435\n00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.937\n&gt;&gt; As what you'll end up seeing here,\nokay?\n\n436\n00:25:42.937 --> 00:25:45.918\nSo it tells you right here\nthat the telemetry agent,\n\n437\n00:25:45.918 --> 00:25:48.169\nas we take a look at the computer again.\n\n438\n00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:52.416\nIt tells you that the telemetry agent is\nincluded in with the Office 2016 client\n\n439\n00:25:52.416 --> 00:25:53.460\ncomputers.\n\n440\n00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.996\nSo you don't have to worry about\nthat one if you do that, okay?\n\n441\n00:25:57.996 --> 00:26:03.580\nAll right, now, you can also of course,\nconfigure the telemetry agent too.\n\n442\n00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.870\nNow this is where we go into group policy,\nokay?\n\n443\n00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:11.372\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what we're doing here\nthrough group policy is importing those\n\n444\n00:26:11.372 --> 00:26:13.900\npreviously customized settings.\n\n445\n00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.761\nAnd that's what we're just\ngonna go ahead and do.\n\n446\n00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, remember that right now at\na default install of group policy.\n\n447\n00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.208\nWe don't have all of the Office settings\nthat are in there that we'll need access\n\n448\n00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:27.430\nto for the Telemetry dashboard.\n\n449\n00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:31.760\nSo by us downloading this, it will give\nus as administrative templates, but\n\n450\n00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.380\nnow we need to get them into group policy.\n\n451\n00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.240\nLet's at least show you where\nyou actually go to do this,\n\n452\n00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.800\nif you're going to be\ndoing something like this.\n\n453\n00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.389\nSo on my machine, I'm simply going\nto click on the Start Button,\n\n454\n00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:44.640\ngo to Server Manager.\n\n455\n00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:50.930\nAnd within Server Manager,\nI'm going to need to head to Tools.\n\n456\n00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.853\nFrom there, select\nthe Group Policy Management link, and\n\n457\n00:26:55.853 --> 00:26:59.457\nthis should bring up my\nGroup Policy Management console.\n\n458\n00:26:59.457 --> 00:27:03.070\nNow, when we start to do this here,\nwhat we're looking for\n\n459\n00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.830\nis gonna be underneath Domains.\n\n460\n00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:11.450\nAnd expand out my domain, and then\nwe're looking at group policy objects.\n\n461\n00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.760\nNow, that's a little bit small,\nlet me zoom in there.\n\n462\n00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:18.160\nGroup policy objects,\nthen I can create a group policy.\n\n463\n00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.680\nLet me get rid of this one, that way\nwe'll create new one for us to do this.\n\n464\n00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.320\nSo I can right click on\ngroup policy objects.\n\n465\n00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.400\nAnd then select New, and\n\n466\n00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.260\nthen we'll create another one here o365,\nlike I was doing before.\n\n467\n00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.040\nAnd click OK.\n\n468\n00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.078\nIf we wanted to import new settings,\n\n469\n00:27:39.078 --> 00:27:42.317\nI just right click on that\npolicy select import settings.\n\n470\n00:27:42.317 --> 00:27:45.119\nAnd it's here that you would go and\nsearch for\n\n471\n00:27:45.119 --> 00:27:49.390\nthose administrative templates\nthat you have downloaded.\n\n472\n00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:52.130\nAnd that will automatically fill it in for\nyou.\n\n473\n00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.031\nThe reason why I'm not doing this,\ncuz I previously done this and\n\n474\n00:27:55.031 --> 00:27:56.259\nthere was no need for that.\n\n475\n00:27:56.259 --> 00:27:59.346\nAnd what will end up happening\nwhen you do this thes,\n\n476\n00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:03.360\nis if I select, let's say like\ndefault domain controller policy.\n\n477\n00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:10.460\nAnd go to Edit, that should fill up the\nuser policy and administrative templates.\n\n478\n00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.670\nAnd here's a few things that should end\nup appearing that you don't normally see.\n\n479\n00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.526\nNotice all of these that\nare labeled as Microsoft Excel,\n\n480\n00:28:18.526 --> 00:28:21.106\nOffice, OneNote, all that, okay.\n\n481\n00:28:21.106 --> 00:28:23.980\nAll those wouldn't be there,\nif we didn't do that.\n\n482\n00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:28.071\nBut the one that we're really looking for\nis right here under Office 2016.\n\n483\n00:28:28.071 --> 00:28:32.460\nHave I select that one,\nthen i scroll down.\n\n484\n00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.230\nYou actually see we gonna get into this a\nlittle bit later, but that's what we were\n\n485\n00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.370\nlooking for to telemetry dashboard,\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n486\n00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.650\n&gt;&gt; So we need to get this in here\nif we're going to control and\n\n487\n00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.800\nconfigure those telemetry agents.\n\n488\n00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.173\nThat's where it's gonna be that we do so.\n\n489\n00:28:47.173 --> 00:28:51.710\nSo inside that group policy,\nwe'll end up managing it from there.\n\n490\n00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:56.248\nAnd that is just part of configuring\nthat telemetry agent to work\n\n491\n00:28:56.248 --> 00:28:57.938\nthe way that we need to.\n\n492\n00:28:57.938 --> 00:29:03.670\nFrom that point, this is where you end\nup connecting directly to that database.\n\n493\n00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:08.160\nAnd then, from that connection,\nwe'll end up seeing if there's any data.\n\n494\n00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.290\nBut it doesn't always happen immediately,\nso we still need to talk about that.\n\n495\n00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:16.180\nBut at this point, I've actually talked\nway too long, and that means we've run out\n\n496\n00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.850\nof a little bit of time, so\nwe'll probably need a part two.\n\n497\n00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:19.700\n&gt;&gt; I think so, Ronnie.\n\n498\n00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.280\nI did have one other question for you.\n\n499\n00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.230\nNow because we were looking at this domain\njoin computer, is there a way that we can\n\n500\n00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:29.550\nstill utilize telemetry without\nusing a domain environment?\n\n501\n00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes there is, but\nthis requires a registry modification.\n\n502\n00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.930\nAnd this is something that we\ndefinitely need to think about here\n\n503\n00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.710\nif we're going to do this.\n\n504\n00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.760\nSo let me switch on over here and\nthis should be quick.\n\n505\n00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.620\nOver here onto,\nthis is a non domain joined computer.\n\n506\n00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:50.871\nThe one that Lance is on, and\nI'm gonna bring up the registry editor,\n\n507\n00:29:50.871 --> 00:29:53.278\nat least I think I am, regedit.\n\n508\n00:29:56.107 --> 00:29:57.630\nAnd run this.\n\n509\n00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.998\nAnd you'll see that there's a couple of\ndifferent options that you'll actually\n\n510\n00:30:01.998 --> 00:30:07.629\nhave right here If I go to the Let's see,\nit's the current user.\n\n511\n00:30:07.629 --> 00:30:11.644\nSoftware and Microsoft.\n\n512\n00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:17.449\nAnd then I scroll down to Office here, And\n\n513\n00:30:17.449 --> 00:30:21.282\nthen in Office, let me see, 16,\nthat's the one that we're on\n\n514\n00:30:23.927 --> 00:30:27.420\nWe would actually go into OSM, okay?\n\n515\n00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.070\nNow, OSM is a weird setting\nthat's actually in here.\n\n516\n00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.800\nIt's not named after any\nproduct that we have on here.\n\n517\n00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.470\nSo, OSM actually stands for\nOffice Service Manager.\n\n518\n00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.280\nIs what it stands for, and that's actually\nthe group that created this policy and\n\n519\n00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.490\nthat did all this here that's based\nin Japan, is what they're based in.\n\n520\n00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.630\nThen you can go to\nthe telemetry dashboard.\n\n521\n00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.646\nAnd it's in here that if\nwe actually have group,\n\n522\n00:30:52.646 --> 00:30:56.510\nwe can actually set up how\nthat actually works in here.\n\n523\n00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.219\nSo there's a bunch of settings\nthat are actually right here.\n\n524\n00:30:59.219 --> 00:31:02.731\nNot that you need to know it this deep but\nyes, you can go and\n\n525\n00:31:02.731 --> 00:31:06.478\nfind where out there on the internet\nyou can go and find where.\n\n526\n00:31:06.478 --> 00:31:09.470\nIf I'm doing this for\na non domain joined computer,\n\n527\n00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.940\ncan I do this to have it report\nback to my telemetry database?\n\n528\n00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.097\nYes it's possible.\n\n529\n00:31:14.097 --> 00:31:17.664\nBut, if you really didn't need it\nreporting back to the centralized\n\n530\n00:31:17.664 --> 00:31:21.220\ndatabase, you can simply look\nat it on your own computer.\n\n531\n00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.160\nBy just opening up that telemetry\ndashboard, and it show you all the stuff\n\n532\n00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.868\non your own computer,\nwithout going any further than that.\n\n533\n00:31:27.868 --> 00:31:32.580\nBut overall though, if you need to do it,\nit is possible to have it report that way.\n\n534\n00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:37.080\nBut you have to do registry modifications,\nwhich are not always easy.\n\n535\n00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.160\nSo, make sure you understand that too.\n\n536\n00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.990\nAnd that's where you actually\nsee that a lot of settings.\n\n537\n00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:44.440\n&gt;&gt; Perfect Ronnie, thank you for\ntaking the time to answer that, and\n\n538\n00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.060\nactually just show us as well.\n\n539\n00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.200\nAnd thank you ladies

[CROSSTALK]\nYou're\n\n4\n00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:12.216\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:15.835\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Enabling Office\n365 Services series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:18.120\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.700\nIn this episode, we'll continue to look\nat how to set up telemetry and reporting.\n\n8\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.680\nThis is actually a part two, and with\nus back in studios is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.240\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\nas we continue now to take a look at,\n\n11\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.150\nwell, what is it that we're\nexpecting to get once we set up,\n\n12\n00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.180\nof course, the office telemetry and\neverything is set up?\n\n13\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.360\nSo let's go ahead and review some of\nthe things we've been talking about from\n\n14\n00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.970\nthe part one to make sure we understand\nwhat we're actually heading into.\n\n15\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.260\nThe setup to the Office 365 telemetry\nitself, for the Office data, it can\n\n16\n00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.768\nbe a little overwhelming, if this is the\nfirst time that you've actually done it.\n\n17\n00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:03.030\nSo we wanna make sure that you at\nleast have a chance of doing this and\n\n18\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.620\nthat you can actually do this on your own,\neven in a small environment.\n\n19\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.330\nSo let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n20\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.322\nSo here it is on my machine as we\nstart to take into what we need to do.\n\n21\n00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:18.052\nOne of the questions that was asked by the\nway, if I don't know exactly what I need,\n\n22\n00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:20.366\nis there something that\nreally helps us to do this?\n\n23\n00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.838\nWell, there really is.\n\n24\n00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:24.890\nOnce you actually have Office\ninstalled on the computer,\n\n25\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.530\nall you really need to do\nis go to your Start menu.\n\n26\n00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.230\nAnd then,\nonce you're actually on the Windows, and\n\n27\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.310\nyour Start, go to Office 2016 tools here.\n\n28\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.400\nAnd from there we are looking for\nthe Telemetry Dashboard.\n\n29\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520\nOnce we saw in that Telemetry Dashboard,\n\n30\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.410\nif this is your first time\ntaking a look at this.\n\n31\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.790\nThe great thing is, there is usually\na couple of things you can do.\n\n32\n00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.400\nAs you read down through this,\ngo all the way down to the bottom.\n\n33\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.120\nYou'll notice that there is\na link here for getting started.\n\n34\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.940\nBut all this other information is good for\n\n35\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.380\nyou to review if this is\nthe first time you've done this.\n\n36\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.170\nBut we've already done\na little bit of that, so\n\n37\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.670\nI'm not gonna worry about\nthat in this episode.\n\n38\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.660\nI select Let's get started.\n\n39\n00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.070\nAnd then, well, you can't ask for\nmuch better than this.\n\n40\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.630\nIt actually lists out the steps in\nthe order that you would normally take\n\n41\n00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.900\nto get connected here.\n\n42\n00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.680\nSo we went through, we took a look\nat these ideas of the prerequisites.\n\n43\n00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.450\nWe installed this Telemetry Processor and\nthen we talked about\n\n44\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.490\nwhat we can do if we have earlier\neditions of Office than 2013.\n\n45\n00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.660\nSo 2003, 2007, 2010.\n\n46\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.300\nWe would probably end up deploying this\ntelemetry agent to those guys, but\n\n47\n00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.130\nin 2013 and\nin 2016 it's really built in for us.\n\n48\n00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.460\nThen we can configure the Telemetry Agent,\nand that's where we can get into group\n\n49\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.660\npolicy or we can use registry keys\nto help us to get that set up.\n\n50\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.520\nOnce everything is done there,\n\n51\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.090\nthen you also have this idea\nof connecting to the database.\n\n52\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.030\nNow the one thing that I should mention\nright here, one this pre-requisite setups.\n\n53\n00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.540\nIf you select this, if you don't have\na database installed and especially for\n\n54\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.370\ntesting, notice it will\ngive you this ability for\n\n55\n00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.500\nyou to download and\ninstall the SQL Server Express Edition.\n\n56\n00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.440\nAnd this is great,\nespecially in a test environment, but\n\n57\n00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.870\nif you already have\nan existing SQL Server setup?\n\n58\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.290\nWell, it's not very\ndifficult at this point.\n\n59\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.340\nBut it may require you to get help\nfrom somebody else that says,\n\n60\n00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.060\nhey, can I create a database here?\n\n61\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.710\nAnd here's the permissions that I need.\n\n62\n00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.500\nMake sure you do something like that, too.\n\n63\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.130\n&gt;&gt; So you've already set this SQL database\nup for our particular show here, Ronnie?\n\n64\n00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.480\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so we've already got everything\nset up, everything is ready to go for\n\n65\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.640\nus to actually be able to see and\nto get data ready to get in there.\n\n66\n00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.600\nBut before we do that, there's also\na couple of other things that I\n\n67\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.820\nneeded to make sure that I said, and I\ncan't remember if I said them in part one.\n\n68\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.919\nSo let me go ahead and\nsay them now as we do so.\n\n69\n00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.085\nEven though the prerequisites are there in\na testing environment we're more likely\n\n70\n00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:05.820\nto condense things together, because I've\ngot everything set up on one server right.\n\n71\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.942\nSo I've got telemetry database,\n\n72\n00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:12.060\nthat SQL server that we're talking about,\nall that's on that same computer.\n\n73\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.480\nI'm gonna run the telemetry\nprocessor on that same computer,\n\n74\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.450\neven the shared folder where\neverybody in my organization\n\n75\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.160\nwould essentially send their data to\nis also gonna be on that one machine.\n\n76\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.220\nAnd Cherokee,\nif you think about that, right?\n\n77\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.503\nThat means that one machine if I have\na lot of users is gonna be taxed really\n\n78\n00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:32.907\nheavily in terms of resources, right?\n\n79\n00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:36.413\nCPU's gonna spike, storage space, RAM.\n\n80\n00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:39.550\nYou name it,\nit's pretty heavy at that point.\n\n81\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.260\nBut overall though, in a testing\nenvironment when I only have one other\n\n82\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.240\ncomputer, it's not gonna harm it at all.\n\n83\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.500\nBut if it is spread out,\n\n84\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.280\nyou just need to make sure that you know\nwhere those components are gonna be.\n\n85\n00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.160\nSo that way,\nyou can use the UNC path to connect.\n\n86\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.020\nYou make sure that whoever's helping\nyou to connect to the SQL database,\n\n87\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.060\nthat they give you the right path and the\nright info as well as the database name.\n\n88\n00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.480\nAnd once that's all done,\nthen you connect to it, and\n\n89\n00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.410\nit everything is set up correctly,\nyou are ready to go, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.100\nSo that can be done and\nall that's actually ready to go.\n\n91\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.270\nBut there are a couple of other\nthings that need to be done,\n\n92\n00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.640\nif you're going to do this too, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.610\nSo let's talk about some of\nthose other things as well.\n\n94\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.830\nSo we need to talk about some basic\nhardware requirements first, and\n\n95\n00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.300\nthen we need to show you just some of the\nother things that I did to make sure that\n\n96\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.140\nwe could run this in a test environment,\nis what we were going to do.\n\n97\n00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what are we gonna\nlook at first here, Ronnie?\n\n98\n00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.131\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's talk about the idea\nof just the hardware requirements,\n\n99\n00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.538\nwhich I can't say.\n\n100\n00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:43.180\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer.\n\n101\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.710\nOn my desktop right now,\n\n102\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.430\nI wanted us to make sure that we\nunderstood these limitations here.\n\n103\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.678\nAnd this link will be in the show notes,\nbut if you just wanted to put into your\n\n104\n00:05:54.678 --> 00:06:00.682\nfavorite search engine, Office 365\nTelemetry Dashboard hardware requirement.\n\n105\n00:06:00.682 --> 00:06:04.310\nI think that's what I had typed in,\nit brought me right to the,\n\n106\n00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.966\nthe right link here and when you scroll\ndown about halfway, supported limits for\n\n107\n00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:11.640\nTelemetry Dashboard components.\n\n108\n00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.453\nAnd what we want to make\nsure that we understand,\n\n109\n00:06:15.453 --> 00:06:18.992\nsupported limits for a telemetry database.\n\n110\n00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:25.360\nHost telemetry data for\nup to 100,000 users, right?\n\n111\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.500\nIt can host up to ten Telemetry Processor\nand shared folder pairs.\n\n112\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.960\nHost up to 30 users of\nthe Telemetry Dashboard.\n\n113\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.570\nYou name it,\nnow that's pretty hefty, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.610\nSo multiple telemetry processors\n\n115\n00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.230\ncan connect to the same SQL database\nas well as use the same folder, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.940\nBut it's over here where it says,\nsupported limits for\n\n117\n00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.350\neach Telemetry Processor and\nshared folder.\n\n118\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.330\nSo each particular Telemetry Processor,\n\n119\n00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.660\nthey can actually support\nup to about 50,000 users.\n\n120\n00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.380\nGet there to do this.\n\n121\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.440\nNow, if you only have one, you only have\none regardless of the numbers that you\n\n122\n00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.510\nhave, that's what you have.\n\n123\n00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.200\n&gt;&gt; Or the list of that\nmaximum theoretical limit.\n\n124\n00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.420\n&gt;&gt; So, what does that mean?\n\n125\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.470\nThat means that as you overtax it,\nit's gonna burn and it's gonna slow down.\n\n126\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.590\nBut this is one of the neat things that\nOffice Service Manager team that's\n\n127\n00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.956\nover in Japan that came up with this\nentire concept, where they realized that\n\n128\n00:07:24.956 --> 00:07:30.350\na lot of times, this is what will end\nup happening is that it records, right?\n\n129\n00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.196\nIt begins to actually do some of the\ntelemetry data right when you first log\n\n130\n00:07:35.196 --> 00:07:38.400\non, and of course throughout the day too.\n\n131\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.990\nWell, think about your own organization,\nthe very fact,\n\n132\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.070\nlet's say that everybody comes\nin at 9 o'clock and goes to 5.\n\n133\n00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.198\nWell, what normally happens?\n\n134\n00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:46.350\nRight about 9 to 905,\n\n135\n00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.210\neverybody in your organization might\njust be logging in at that point.\n\n136\n00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.071\nWell, that could actually send\na ton of telemetry data into that\n\n137\n00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:55.510\nTelemetry Processor.\n\n138\n00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.635\n&gt;&gt; Spike traffic.\n\n139\n00:07:56.635 --> 00:07:59.575\n&gt;&gt; Spike it and\nmaybe cause the system to lock up.\n\n140\n00:07:59.575 --> 00:08:01.735\nIt's very possible to do that.\n\n141\n00:08:01.735 --> 00:08:02.601\nSo instead,\n\n142\n00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:08.810\nwhat they did is that you're not gonna get\nall the telemetry data immediately, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.640\nSo this is where the telemetry\nguys themselves,\n\n144\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.110\nonce they actually realize this, say look,\nwhat we're gonna do is that initial login,\n\n145\n00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.340\nwe're gonna take it over\na span of four hours.\n\n146\n00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.280\nIt might happen immediately for\nsome users.\n\n147\n00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.740\nBut it could be four hours later before\nthey actually report their telemetry data.\n\n148\n00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.640\nSo you may not get immediately,\neverything that's actually right there.\n\n149\n00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.600\nAnd those are set by default,\nin a four hour span, zero to four hours.\n\n150\n00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600\nAnd when you start doing that.\n\n151\n00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.880\nAnd it can be set in terms of\nthe number of minutes to do this.\n\n152\n00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.140\nSo, if we were performing any kind of\nanalysis, and looking at this information\n\n153\n00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.570\nto use, perhaps for troubleshooting,\nor expanding out and designing,\n\n154\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.890\nplanning your network, or whatever it may\nbe, you'd probably wanna at least wait\n\n155\n00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.160\npast that four hour window if you\nleft it at the default setting there.\n\n156\n00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:57.900\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n157\n00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.040\nYeah, you wouldn't actually get really\nany good useful data within that point,\n\n158\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.750\nespecially if you're trying to\nlook at the entire organization.\n\n159\n00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.830\nBut if you're only willing to deal\nwith the data that's ahead of you,\n\n160\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.530\nwhich is whatever amount of\ndata it give you, that's fine.\n\n161\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.620\nBut that's not always a complete picture,\nso\n\n162\n00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.730\nyou may get a bit of skewed\nresults if you do that.\n\n163\n00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.520\nBut there are some other\nthings that need to be set up.\n\n164\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.300\nSo in a testing environment\nit can be frustrating to go,\n\n165\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.060\nall right,\nwe're just testing this thing out, and\n\n166\n00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.010\nyou're waiting there for\nfour hours before any data comes out.\n\n167\n00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.840\nThat's not ever a good thing.\n\n168\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.290\nSo let me show you what I\nended up doing here instead.\n\n169\n00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.300\nLet me see if I can bring\nthis up in my folder here.\n\n170\n00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:46.700\nSo, if I go to my Office 365 folder,\nI'm back on my lab machine.\n\n171\n00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.870\nI created a registry\nedit that we can do here.\n\n172\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.970\nAnd what you're looking for\n\n173\n00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:00.590\nis the numbers that we are gonna\nchange is first of all, this one.\n\n174\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.780\nThat is the AgentInitWait, now you\nmay actually go into your registry,\n\n175\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.180\nand you may go, it isn't there.\n\n176\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.210\nWell, you can actually create this\nfolder or this file, I should say- and\n\n177\n00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.890\nthen run it under administrative\nprivileges, from a command prompt.\n\n178\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.090\nAnd that will insert these keys\nin there if we need to, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.410\nThe key here is you can go and\nsearch for this.\n\n180\n00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.070\nAnd you can actually find this,\nwhere you can copy it into Notepad.\n\n181\n00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.490\nAnd all you have to do is change the name\n\n182\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.860\nof where that common file\nshare is going to be.\n\n183\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:39.360\nAnd then you can change this,\nor you can leave it alone.\n\n184\n00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.500\nSo, in net weight.\n\n185\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.190\nWell, that's actually done I think\nat this point here in a number of\n\n186\n00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.010\nminutes or seconds.\n\n187\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.270\nI can't remember which one.\n\n188\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.810\nBut it says, you're gonna wait this long.\n\n189\n00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:55.010\nAnd what the one indicates at least\nI think one minute before it starts,\n\n190\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.440\nI may be wrong on that.\n\n191\n00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.930\nThe random delay here, is the one\nthat goes from zero to four hours.\n\n192\n00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So this is the one that actually is\n\n193\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.860\ndone in that one.\n\n194\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.440\nAnd notice this one's set to zero.\n\n195\n00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.420\n&gt;&gt; No delay?\n\n196\n00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.650\n&gt;&gt; No delay at all.\n\n197\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.540\nAnd in the test environment\nyou may want to do it,\n\n198\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.840\nit's never recommended in production.\n\n199\n00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.600\nBecause the way that this ends up going\nout, if you go want to actually set this\n\n200\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.560\nthrough group policy, well that's\na big push if you have a large,\n\n201\n00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.720\ngigantic number of machines that\nare connecting in at one time.\n\n202\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.460\nBut in testing environment, I just ran\nthis on the machine that I wanted to.\n\n203\n00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.560\nAnd that creates that\n&gt;&gt; So we wouldn't have to wait for\n\n204\n00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.530\nhours for this to be shown Ronnie?\n\n205\n00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.380\n&gt;&gt; In theory that's exactly\nwhat would end up happening.\n\n206\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.430\nSo that gets put into the registry.\n\n207\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.750\nNow you can go out there\nagain on the Internet and\n\n208\n00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.940\nthen find like I said this file and\nthat way will help you out.\n\n209\n00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.810\nSo the key of course is just making\nsure you know exactly where this is\n\n210\n00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.850\ngoing to be.\n\n211\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.560\nIf you do this.\n\n212\n00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.260\nActually this has changed the name of my,\nthat is changed.\n\n213\n00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.150\nSo I've already tested it,\nI know it works, but there it is, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.720\nSo just make sure that you understand\nwhat you're taking a look at there.\n\n215\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.670\nAnd we actually have\na link to that particular\n\n216\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:11.290\nway where you can actually download that\nkind of template for you to To do this.\n\n217\n00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.450\nSo I'm gonna save that and not worry.\n\n218\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.150\nBut make sure you remember those two,\nright.\n\n219\n00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.430\nThe random delay, the agent random\ndelay and then the agent and\n\n220\n00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.400\nnit state or a wait that you have there.\n\n221\n00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.200\nIf in testing environment that's set down,\nnormally in production,\n\n222\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.900\nyou can adjust those settings but\nnever set them to happen immediately.\n\n223\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.900\nFor your entire organization\nthat could be really bad.\n\n224\n00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.490\n&gt;&gt; Note taken.\n\n225\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.070\n&gt;&gt; On your process, yeah,\non your processors.\n\n226\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.380\nThe other thing that I wanna mention\nif I didn't mention it in part one,\n\n227\n00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.840\nokay, is the database.\n\n228\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.930\nBy default if I'm using SQL\nexpress which is smallest\n\n229\n00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.710\nversion of Microsoft SQL server.\n\n230\n00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.130\nIt's gonna require a minimum\ndatabase of 11 gigs.\n\n231\n00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.600\nSo you have to have at least 11 gigs.\n\n232\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.090\nBut that sounds like a tremendous\namount of space for a database.\n\n233\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:09.910\nBut at the same time you can have\nhundreds or thousands, I should say,\n\n234\n00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.420\nlet's say 50,000 users, 10,000 users.\n\n235\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.170\nJust it can add up very quickly.\n\n236\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.720\nSo for example, remember that if you're\nrunning office 2016 the telemetry\n\n237\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.000\ndata is about 64k each okay.\n\n238\n00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.460\nIf you're running Office 2013 and\n\n239\n00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:28.040\nbefore it's about 50k each okay so\nwhen you add all that up and\n\n240\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.040\nthen you multiply times the number\nof users over a period of a year.\n\n241\n00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.090\nThat can actually equal up very quickly\nto tens of gigabytes very quickly.\n\n242\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.900\nSo when you do something like that, this\nidea of maybe saying hey I'm going to run\n\n243\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.730\nthis on SQL Express, in a real production\nenvironment, probably not a good idea.\n\n244\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.300\nIn other words,\nhaving it on a real SQL database\n\n245\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.280\nthat actually can grow beyond that\nis pretty much the key here, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.320\nEspecially if you have a ton of users.\n\n247\n00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.950\nSo this is just in the testing\nenvironment, okay?\n\n248\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.240\nAnd that's what I wanted\nto make sure of here, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.250\nSo, those are kind of the limitations\nthat we definitely need to be aware of,\n\n250\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.050\nnot only for the exam, but in reality.\n\n251\n00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.090\nSo take a look at those registry settings.\n\n252\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.130\nThose are actually gonna be specially for\nthe exam.\n\n253\n00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.320\nKnowing if those are set, what can happen.\n\n254\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.510\nAnd so most of us just leave it alone and\nlet it do its thing.\n\n255\n00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.930\nBut you can change and\nmake all that adjustment, okay?\n\n256\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.430\nNow once that's all done, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.250\nThis is where it does take a little\nbit of time and patience for\n\n258\n00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:37.320\nyou because even though we've set it\ndown to the lowest state that we can,\n\n259\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.800\nremember that everything happens\nby using a scheduled task.\n\n260\n00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.090\nSo let's take a look then.\n\n261\n00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:46.070\nOnce everything is running, let me\nconnect to this database for right now.\n\n262\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.580\nAnd so it will go ahead and\nfill in the name.\n\n263\n00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.240\nAnd in the previous episode I created\nthis new database which creates that\n\n264\n00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.200\nnew table structure and\neverything where the data's gonna end up.\n\n265\n00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.720\nAnd at this point I'm\njust going to connect in.\n\n266\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.020\nAnd while that's connecting in here,\n\n267\n00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.340\nwe are going to also end up taking\na look at some of this data.\n\n268\n00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.370\nIt doesn't look like anything showing\nup but Let me hold that off for\n\n269\n00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:17.040\njust a moment as we take a look at\njust briefly something else here too.\n\n270\n00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.640\nOkay?\n\n271\n00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.970\nIf you go look, I just really\nneed to monitor this on my own\n\n272\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:26.760\nindividual computer, I don't really care\nabout sending it to a telemetry database.\n\n273\n00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.750\nI can click on the start.\n\n274\n00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.940\nGo to Microsoft Office 2016 tools.\n\n275\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.430\nAnd then all I have to do is select\nthe telemetry log for office.\n\n276\n00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:41.560\nYour machine got to log the information\non that one single machine first and\n\n277\n00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.810\nthen it takes the time to set it up that\ncentral share so here you can see where\n\n278\n00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:52.020\nI actually do have data that is\nlogged on using office here.\n\n279\n00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.986\nOkay?\nSo you can see times and this actually\n\n280\n00:15:54.986 --> 00:16:00.215\nrecording date of today's date and\nyou can also end up seeing here event IDs,\n\n281\n00:16:00.215 --> 00:16:05.590\nBehavior changes,\nthe file that's actually going along here.\n\n282\n00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.840\nAnd as I scroll on down,\nyou'll see more and\n\n283\n00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.205\nmore information dating all the way back\nto yesterday and even the days before.\n\n284\n00:16:12.205 --> 00:16:17.535\nSo we had actually set this up on the\nprevious edition where we went ahead and\n\n285\n00:16:17.535 --> 00:16:19.407\nwe recorded the part one.\n\n286\n00:16:19.407 --> 00:16:22.381\nAnd so during that whole time,\nit was actually gathering data.\n\n287\n00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:26.180\nI hadn't been using it, but it started\nto actually monitor everything then.\n\n288\n00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.240\nSo that's why I ended up getting\na bit more data at this point.\n\n289\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.180\nThe other thing, of course then,\nis if group policy has been changed,\n\n290\n00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:41.936\nyou wanna make sure just like we\nemphasized here Is that on the group.\n\n291\n00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:44.610\nLet me make sure I'm on\nthe right computer here yep.\n\n292\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.289\nSo inside of group policy.\n\n293\n00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:51.860\nI'm trying to get to my server manager.\n\n294\n00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.646\nIt disappeared off the taskbar.\n\n295\n00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.296\nWe wanna make sure that\nthe group policy is enabled.\n\n296\n00:17:00.296 --> 00:17:04.010\nAnd you definitely need to know\nwhere this is going to be located.\n\n297\n00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.944\nThat's the biggest thing I\ncan tell you for right now.\n\n298\n00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.994\nInside of the group policy objects,\n\n299\n00:17:09.994 --> 00:17:13.100\nI'm using default domain\npolicy as our example.\n\n300\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.664\nYou can create your own and\n\n301\n00:17:14.664 --> 00:17:18.092\nthat's probably better aspect\nof how you would do this.\n\n302\n00:17:19.723 --> 00:17:24.348\nThat's inside of the Group Policy\nManagement Editor under User Configuration\n\n303\n00:17:24.348 --> 00:17:25.600\nand under Policies.\n\n304\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.910\nWe're gonna expand out\nAdministrative Templates.\n\n305\n00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.432\nAnd once we're in\nAdministrative Templates,\n\n306\n00:17:33.432 --> 00:17:38.450\nthis is where we're gonna select\nMicrosoft Office 2016 Scroll\n\n307\n00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:43.394\ndown to the telemetry dashboard and\nthis is once again a reminder.\n\n308\n00:17:43.394 --> 00:17:47.540\nHere is the minimum that\nneeds to be set on.\n\n309\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.680\nOne, should make sense here.\n\n310\n00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.590\nTurn on the telemetry data connection.\n\n311\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.770\nSo that should be on.\n\n312\n00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:54.890\nHopefully that makes sense.\n\n313\n00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.006\n&gt;&gt; All right enabled.\n\n314\n00:17:56.006 --> 00:17:56.990\n&gt;&gt; Enabled, yep.\n&gt;&gt; Looks like we're good to go Ronnie.\n\n315\n00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.160\n&gt;&gt; There you go, yep.\n\n316\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.360\nTurn on data uploading.\n\n317\n00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.780\nSo if you do this in your group policy,\nright, even though every machine that's\n\n318\n00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.902\njoined to your domain is\ncollecting data individually,\n\n319\n00:18:07.902 --> 00:18:10.847\nI showed you an example of\nthat just a moment ago here.\n\n320\n00:18:10.847 --> 00:18:13.947\nIf we don't tell it that we're saying,\nhey,\n\n321\n00:18:13.947 --> 00:18:17.340\nupload the data then is\nnot gonna work okay.\n\n322\n00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.601\nThen make sure you actually do put\nthe proper UNC path where that data gonna\n\n323\n00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.771\nend up being stored coz\nthat's a key component right.\n\n324\n00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.380\nAnd remember the process\ngoes from agent and\n\n325\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.893\nthen in their shared folder to the\ntelemetry processor and then at that point\n\n326\n00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:37.270\nIt's going to end up at the database,\nfrom the database to the dashboard, okay.\n\n327\n00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.240\nSo that's why it's\nactually very important.\n\n328\n00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.406\nThose three have to be enabled\nif we are to do this, okay?\n\n329\n00:18:44.406 --> 00:18:49.364\nSo earlier, once everything is set up\nhere, this is where earlier I went\n\n330\n00:18:49.364 --> 00:18:54.326\nto another machine and I just logged\nin and I created different folders,\n\n331\n00:18:54.326 --> 00:18:59.630\ndifferent files I should say,\non each one of those machines as well.\n\n332\n00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:04.900\nSo it should show up here in the telemetry\ndashboard if everything is working the way\n\n333\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.860\nI say it's gonna work.\n\n334\n00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.200\nInside of Microsoft office tools,\nI already have it running,\n\n335\n00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.400\nI don't need to go back to that.\n\n336\n00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.290\nI just need to bring\nit up on the task bar.\n\n337\n00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:18.337\nIf I now select the Telemetry dashboard,\nthis is where\n\n338\n00:19:18.337 --> 00:19:24.568\nI can go to the Documents tab,\nAnd now I can start seeing\n\n339\n00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:29.070\njust a couple of options here, lemme\nsee if can zoom in a little bit, okay?\n\n340\n00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:34.782\nSo you can see what the TelemetryLog\nthat two users Have actually used this.\n\n341\n00:19:34.782 --> 00:19:38.314\nIf I select that I can see the\nadministrator which is an account I was\n\n342\n00:19:38.314 --> 00:19:39.980\nlogged into earlier.\n\n343\n00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.630\nAnd then here is the one\nI'm logged into currently.\n\n344\n00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:48.090\nSo I'm actually starting to see just\na little bit of data come across.\n\n345\n00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.900\nNormally if we're preparing for\n\n346\n00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.090\na migration which is\nwhat we were saying here.\n\n347\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:57.885\nMoving to office solutions If I select\nthis, this is probably the more\n\n348\n00:19:57.885 --> 00:20:01.966\nimportant of those two screens\nthat we wanna take a look at.\n\n349\n00:20:01.966 --> 00:20:05.872\nAnd this where you can see\nthat solution names and\n\n350\n00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:10.870\nalso some of the other things\nthat are plugged in here.\n\n351\n00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:14.778\nSo the Office usage,\nI can even see the applications.\n\n352\n00:20:14.778 --> 00:20:18.145\nI scroll down there's one for\nPowerPoint, here's one for\n\n353\n00:20:18.145 --> 00:20:22.140\nOutlook as we start seeing let me see\nif I scroll down a little bit more.\n\n354\n00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.577\nAnd there may be some that, let's see\nif I actually refreshed this, and\n\n355\n00:20:26.577 --> 00:20:30.087\nsee if we can get a little bit\nmore data that comes in here.\n\n356\n00:20:30.087 --> 00:20:34.776\nIt is all Outlook at this point, so\nthere has actually been some other ones in\n\n357\n00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:38.309\nthere What we're looking for\nis, like right here.\n\n358\n00:20:38.309 --> 00:20:41.005\nLet me see if I can find out\nwhat the name of this one is.\n\n359\n00:20:41.005 --> 00:20:45.085\n&gt;&gt; So what you're actually looking at here\nare going to be the particular files that\n\n360\n00:20:45.085 --> 00:20:49.420\nhave been generated from whatever it\nis you're collecting that information.\n\n361\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:54.468\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this gives you the ability\nto see is this something critical or\n\n362\n00:20:54.468 --> 00:20:56.390\nis this informative here?\n\n363\n00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:01.080\nAnd a lot of times, once you actually\nstart seeing this, you also want to remove\n\n364\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.220\nthis number one, and that will take\naway all of the actual solutions.\n\n365\n00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:10.150\nAll of the files that\nMicrosoft itself generated.\n\n366\n00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.267\nSo this may actually reduce us to none.\n\n367\n00:21:12.267 --> 00:21:14.260\nSo that's why they wanna take it away.\n\n368\n00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.250\nBut if you actually have your own data and\n\n369\n00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.390\neverything else is coming in, that's\nwhat you'll end up seeing here, too.\n\n370\n00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:26.888\nYou can now see, also, the processor,\n2 users on 2 different computers.\n\n371\n00:21:26.888 --> 00:21:28.750\nAnd then the deployment.\n\n372\n00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.350\nAnd there it is.\n\n373\n00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:35.401\nFrom those 2 different computers I\nam running Office 2016, 32-bit here.\n\n374\n00:21:35.401 --> 00:21:36.830\nThis is where it actually gets neat.\n\n375\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.620\nOnce you actually start\ngenerating those custom reports.\n\n376\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.980\nAnd under solutions, if there were any\nreal problems that actually existed.\n\n377\n00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.930\nWhere it gives you the ability to do a lot\nof things is it will start adding in.\n\n378\n00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.062\nLike if this is something that\ncan be corrected in group policy,\n\n379\n00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:54.734\nit will go ahead and create for\nus a PowerShell script.\n\n380\n00:21:54.734 --> 00:21:59.370\nThat will normally allow us to actually\njust click on it, and end up running that.\n\n381\n00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.650\nAnd actually change it through,\nto group policy if we need to.\n\n382\n00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.500\nSo there's a lot of different\nbits of data in here.\n\n383\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.512\nThat it's worth taking the time to\ngenerate, at least a little bit of data,\n\n384\n00:22:10.512 --> 00:22:11.149\nif you can.\n\n385\n00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:13.350\nAnd I say, it wasn't to long ago.\n\n386\n00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:17.520\nIt was actually about two hours ago that\nI've started creating different files, so\n\n387\n00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.059\nI still have another two hours before\neverything starts reporting in.\n\n388\n00:22:21.059 --> 00:22:22.700\n&gt;&gt; In yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we just don't know.\n\n389\n00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.400\nSo even though I said run it immediately,\n\n390\n00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.870\nit can take it's sweet time,\neven though we do this.\n\n391\n00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:32.360\nSo just kinda realize that there is\nother things that are going on and\n\n392\n00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.080\nthat's what you'll end up seeing.\n\n393\n00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.910\nSo make sure you take a few\nminutes To make it run,\n\n394\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:41.054\nyou'll have to change those registry\nsettings or it's not gonna run or\n\n395\n00:22:41.054 --> 00:22:43.734\nif you're really patient-\n&gt;&gt; Just wait the four\n\n396\n00:22:43.734 --> 00:22:46.520\nhours\n&gt;&gt; You can wait the four hours and knowing\n\n397\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.640\nmy luck it would be three hours and\n59 minutes, is what I'd have to wait here.\n\n398\n00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.108\nBut just kinda make sure you take a look.\n\n399\n00:22:53.108 --> 00:22:57.406\nNow most of us are probably not\ngonna deal with this at the extreme\n\n400\n00:22:57.406 --> 00:23:02.410\na lot of times because we have other\nthings that help us to monitor.\n\n401\n00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.840\nBut if you are saying this\nis a tool you want to use.\n\n402\n00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.580\n&gt;&gt; Relying on it heavily.\n\n403\n00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.281\n&gt;&gt; Yep, then you definitely need at\nleast get it set up and see how it's\n\n404\n00:23:11.281 --> 00:23:16.081\ngoing to work out for everything else\nthat you need to get going here.\n\n405\n00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:18.600\nBut at least there you're\nactually seeing it work.\n\n406\n00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.900\nAnd it does take a little bit of time,\n\n407\n00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.340\nit can be a little bit frustrating just\nwaiting for that initial data to come in.\n\n408\n00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.300\nBut once you have one come in, it's not\ngonna be long, it just takes a little bit\n\n409\n00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.840\nof time, and then everything\nwill actually start coming in.\n\n410\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.603\nYou'll be able to do some analysis on it.\n\n411\n00:23:31.603 --> 00:23:33.955\nCreate the customer report\nthat you need to and\n\n412\n00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:37.310\nthat will help you get started\nin Office 365 telemetry.\n\n413\n00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.230\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Ronnie, it sounds like a\ngreat way that we can really keep a close\n\n414\n00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.550\neye on what's going on with\nout Office 365 products.\n\n415\n00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.840\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentleman for tuning in but for\n\n416\n00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.110\nthis show we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n417\n00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.010\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n418\n00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:50.790\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

00:00:08.472\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:12.191\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:15.685\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Enabling Office\n365 Services series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:17.750\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.664\nIn this episode we'll be looking\nat how to pulling in for\n\n8\n00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:23.530\nOffice 365 clients to set\nup that infrastructure.\n\n9\n00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.200\nWith us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Work in studio.\n\n10\n00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.560\nThank you for joining us Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.803\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\nas we take a look at planning for\n\n12\n00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:33.587\nMicrosoft Office 365.\n\n13\n00:00:33.587 --> 00:00:36.329\nAnd this may have seem\na little bit strange to you,\n\n14\n00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.591\neven watching the series in order,\nin the way that we've been doing things.\n\n15\n00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:43.980\nAnd you're probably like saying why\nare you talking about planning now?\n\n16\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.840\nAnd a lot of the concepts that we\ngo over are going to sound familiar\n\n17\n00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.850\nbecause we've already covered most of\nthem when we talked about this one.\n\n18\n00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150\nAnd it's just the order and\nthe way they appear and\n\n19\n00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.690\nthe skills measured on the exam.\n\n20\n00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.910\nAnd that's just way it came out.\n\n21\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.370\nSo, logically it makes sense\nto actually do this one first.\n\n22\n00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.270\nBut I just took the way that it came out,\nis the way that I chose to run this.\n\n23\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.630\nSo that's pretty much the only,\nthe unusual conundrum that we have here.\n\n24\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.030\nAs far as,\nif you're wondering why would he do that?\n\n25\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.520\nIt's just because it-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what came first?\n\n26\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.650\nThe chicken or the egg here?\n\n27\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.787\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So but that's why.\n\n28\n00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:23.394\nOkay, so\nif it is a little bit confusing, and\n\n29\n00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:25.578\nall of a sudden you've been\nwatching several episodes.\n\n30\n00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:29.360\nAnd you're like, he's kind of\nreviewing a lot of stuff already,\n\n31\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.060\nwhat's going on here, and\nthat's because of that.\n\n32\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.600\nThat's pretty much we gonna talk that.\n\n33\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.260\nNow, when it comes out to the planning for\nOffice 365 clients, right?\n\n34\n00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.190\nWhat we are trying to do of\ncourse is get them set up, and\n\n35\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.050\nunderstand the methodology of just\na little bit of that as we get started and\n\n36\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.500\nwhat we actually have to begin to do.\n\n37\n00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.330\nSo, when it comes down to planning,\nit really is about trying to say,\n\n38\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.430\nwhat do our clients really need,\n\n39\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.240\nto understand about the products that\nwe're about to show them or get to them.\n\n40\n00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.810\nAnd then making sure that they have a good\nunderstanding of how to get what they need\n\n41\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.150\nto onto their machines and even do\na little bit of troubleshooting here.\n\n42\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.980\nSo we're gonna see a little bit\nabout the deployment method.\n\n43\n00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.620\nWe're also gonna talk about configuration\njust a little bit briefly and\n\n44\n00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.540\nhow easy that really is.\n\n45\n00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.900\nAlso we'll end up seeing\na little bit more about\n\n46\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.810\nsome of the other products that you might\nnot have actually been familiar with.\n\n47\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.320\nSkype for business, and lastly,\n\n48\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.180\nwe'll talk about troubleshooting Office\nin it's installation on our machines too.\n\n49\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.920\nSo we'll actually see all\nthis in this episode, and\n\n50\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.600\nthat's what we're going to take a look at.\n\n51\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo Ronnie, I see here on our list,\n\n52\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.100\nwe have C2R and MSI.\n\n53\n00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.550\nWhat are we talking about?\n\n54\n00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.950\nDifferent ways to deploy\nthis installation?\n\n55\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.080\nThe very fact is,\n\n56\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.380\nremember that when it comes down to\nthe way that we used to do software.\n\n57\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.370\nIt was fairly simple, we either had\nit on a DVD and we put in the DVD,\n\n58\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.010\nlet the autorun take over and\nwe just simply clicked next.\n\n59\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.490\nThat's pretty much the way it\nhas been forever and a day.\n\n60\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.270\nWell now though and\n\n61\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.400\nwhen you start doing stuff like that\nas all of us have done in the past.\n\n62\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.770\nIt was pretty much a waiting game, right?\n\n63\n00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.470\nWhen we started to install software that\nway, it took over your whole machine.\n\n64\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.980\nIt’s not like in the background you\ncould start playing something or\n\n65\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.020\neven start working on something else,\nyou essentially had to let the machine\n\n66\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.520\nkind of-\n&gt;&gt; Run its course.\n\n67\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.440\n&gt;&gt; Run its course, and\nthen once it was done, we were done,\n\n68\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.070\nand you know\n&gt;&gt; Then we can actually move on to do\n\n69\n00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.150\nother things.\n\n70\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.310\nBut in today's world and the way that we\ndeploy software today is a lot different\n\n71\n00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.960\nin the fact that Office 365\nis a cloud solution for us.\n\n72\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.160\nWe're no longer reliant on physical\nmedia for the install anymore and\n\n73\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.060\neven then when we actually do have it it\nusually comes in the form of a download.\n\n74\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.090\nWhen we start talking about\nthe idea of downloads,\n\n75\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.080\nthere is really two different ones for\ninstalling office, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.680\nThe traditional way, especially\nin a massive deployment solution,\n\n77\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.230\nit might be using the dot MSI,\nthe Microsoft installer.\n\n78\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.030\nThat will allows us of course to use\nsome type of software policy, or\n\n79\n00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.780\ngroup policy, excuse me.\n\n80\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.260\nTo be able to run the install, and\n\n81\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.270\nscript it out, and allow then,\nus to be able to configure it in that way.\n\n82\n00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.150\nSet software restriction policies,\nuse AppLocker, do whatever we want to.\n\n83\n00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.330\nThe MSI is the way to go, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.990\nSo that's been traditionally\nthe way that we have installed\n\n85\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.440\nproducts in the background.\n\n86\n00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.980\nGives us a lot of control\nthat we have available to us.\n\n87\n00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.230\nBut, if you think about it,\ndepends on what that stuff runs, right?\n\n88\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.540\nSo when we think about\nthe idea of group policy,\n\n89\n00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.420\nyou've got to actually consider that,\nright?\n\n90\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.460\nWhen does group policy run?\n\n91\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.280\nAnd that's kind of the key here, when we\nstart to understand, if we're gonna say\n\n92\n00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.370\nhey, I think I do want to use something\nlike group policy to do the install.\n\n93\n00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:56.380\nOr I can just download the MSI file to\na thumb drive of some sort right and\n\n94\n00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.640\nthen Cherokee can walk around to each\nof the 700 machines that I have and\n\n95\n00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.010\ninstall one yeah and one at a time making\nsure that she has the product key,\n\n96\n00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.870\nmaking sure that it follows\neverything that we want to.\n\n97\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.059\nBut Cherokee, I would believe,\nis smarter, and\n\n98\n00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:12.843\nwhat she would do instead is [CROSSTALK].\n\n99\n00:05:12.843 --> 00:05:14.360\n&gt;&gt; Work smarter, not harder, Rodney.\n\n100\n00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, is to say, hey, look.\n\n101\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.130\nI think with an MSI we can.\n\n102\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.750\n&gt;&gt; There's a more\nefficient way to do that.\n\n103\n00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's gotta be a more efficient way,\n\n104\n00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.650\nwhich is through Group Policy to do so,\nokay?\n\n105\n00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.170\nEven then.\nSo Cherokee,\n\n106\n00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.700\nlet's just talk about this for a moment.\n\n107\n00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Group Policy.\n\n108\n00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.040\nIt tends to run, really, just a couple or\nthree different times, right?\n\n109\n00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.540\nSomebody logs in.\n\n110\n00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.500\nSomebody logs out.\n\n111\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.370\nOkay?\nOr when we reboot the machine.\n\n112\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.920\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Force it.\n\n113\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.540\n&gt;&gt; Unforcing it.\n\n114\n00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.670\nSee you knew more than I did.\n\n115\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.700\nSo at that point, right,\nthink about when that stuff runs.\n\n116\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.320\nSo let's say that we actually put a log\non script to run and install Office.\n\n117\n00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.300\nWell, once we do that the process\nlogging in and then what happens?\n\n118\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.980\nNow all of a sudden the script takes over,\nand now we're installing Office.\n\n119\n00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.700\nUnless they were installing\nevery product in Office now.\n\n120\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.620\nAccess, Excel, Word, Powerpoint.\n\n121\n00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.520\nYou name it.\n\n122\n00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.240\nThat could take several minutes at least,\nright?\n\n123\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.900\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n124\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.260\n&gt;&gt; So even then as the person logs on,\nit might actually do what?\n\n125\n00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.780\nIt might literally take a while\nbefore they can use the machine.\n\n126\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.710\nSo it's not really a lot\ndifferent from the physical media,\n\n127\n00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.070\nexcept that Cherokee doesn't\nhave to walk around with it.\n\n128\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.540\nBut overall though,\nthat's a lot easier on her, but\n\n129\n00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.950\nthe end user's still sitting there going,\nI wonder when this is going to get done.\n\n130\n00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.610\n&gt;&gt; I've got a deadline for\nmy report that's due in 15 minutes, and\n\n131\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Good luck with that one.\n\n132\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.720\nYeah, because it's still going\nto update after that, so\n\n133\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.670\nyou will have have issues\nlike that that go on.\n\n134\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.080\nSo, that is a way.\n\n135\n00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.880\nOkay so, that is a legitimate way\nthat we would have thought about but\n\n136\n00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.250\nwe did move super efficiently, right.\n\n137\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.410\nOne thumb drive, maybe ten thumb drives,\nstill has go around,\n\n138\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.780\nwe still actually deploy everything too.\n\n139\n00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.640\nBut that's one way we can do it.\n\n140\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.930\nToday the prevalent technology is C2R,\nC, the number 2, and the letter R.\n\n141\n00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.620\nThat's an abbreviation for Click 2 Run.\n\n142\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.400\nNow, Click 2 Run type\nof download technology,\n\n143\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.780\nit's not super different from the MSI as\nfar as downloading it and then running it.\n\n144\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.710\nIt says Click 2 Run, so it has to be\nclicked somewhere to actually run it, so\n\n145\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.250\nsomething has to trigger it.\n\n146\n00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.130\nBut the difference here though\nis that now we can go directly\n\n147\n00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.350\nto the Office 365 cloud and we simply just\nclick on a link inside of our subscription\n\n148\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:34.180\nand that begins the process to download\nthat type of click to run file.\n\n149\n00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.720\nThe advantage of the click to run is not\nin its ability to install Office like\n\n150\n00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.870\nthe MSI.\n\n151\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.570\nBut is ability to install office\nin a streaming type of install.\n\n152\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:51.300\nAnd what we mean there by doing this\nis kind of a strange concept for me but\n\n153\n00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:57.903\nit sends me concept right because it asses\nlike here is how big the Office suite is.\n\n154\n00:07:57.903 --> 00:08:00.960\nBut here's what we'll do,\nRonnie and Cherokee.\n\n155\n00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.260\nIs that you can go ahead and\nstart downloading those files,\n\n156\n00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.750\nI can start installing those files.\n\n157\n00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.580\nAnd at the same time once that first\nportion of the install is done you can go\n\n158\n00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:19.890\nahead and use that particular program\nwhile I install in the background.\n\n159\n00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.100\nDoes that sound neater?\n\n160\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so,\nI'm able to still work on my reports and\n\n161\n00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.210\nI'm getting my new piece of software.\n\n162\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.750\nSo it's a win, win.\n\n163\n00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.990\n&gt;&gt; It really is, it allows you to be\nable to understand that process and\n\n164\n00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.340\nto do a lot better in\nterms of the install.\n\n165\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.070\nAnd most users can handle that.\n\n166\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.890\nWe may not, okay, because I always still\nhave that issue because that's what I want\n\n167\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.890\nis, say, look, leave it alone.\n\n168\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.150\nDon't mess with it while it's installing.\n\n169\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.780\nBut the click to run is designed\nto do that streaming process\n\n170\n00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.980\nto be able to do exactly that, okay?\n\n171\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.430\nSo that you can run it even though it's\nactually in the middle of installing for\n\n172\n00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.890\nanother program.\n\n173\n00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:05.200\nSo, it's a neat thing and we did end\nup seeing this in part of an install\n\n174\n00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.480\nthat we did earlier in a manual deployment\ninstall, it allowed us to do this.\n\n175\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.720\nDecision makers need to go ahead and\nfigure out\n\n176\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.710\nwhat they actually want to happen and how\nthey choose for this to happen, as well.\n\n177\n00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.240\nSo if you are going to\nuse that click to run,\n\n178\n00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.800\nwell, you can do it in\na user-driven type of deployment.\n\n179\n00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.420\nRemember, this is allowing, of course, the\nuser to simply click on the install link\n\n180\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.000\nand let it run, and let it install Office.\n\n181\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.350\nAnd it will tell you, you can continue to\nuse your computer while this is going on.\n\n182\n00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.200\nAnd then it will actually\nfully install Office.\n\n183\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.490\nBut you can also end up using\nthe Office products within it too.\n\n184\n00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.210\nThe other thing,\n\n185\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.170\nof course, is that once they actually\nchoose that, that's usually the way to go.\n\n186\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:50.040\nBut, if we want the IT managed type\nof install, it can be done that way.\n\n187\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.380\nWe just disallow,\nwe kind of hide that button that allows\n\n188\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.500\nthe user to click and install itself.\n\n189\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.820\nAnd instead we can use that\nOffice Deployment Tool that's out there\n\n190\n00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.910\nthat now we can download that.\n\n191\n00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.450\nRun that along with the configuration.xml\nfile to customize and\n\n192\n00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.940\nto control the setup the way\nthat we want to if we choose to.\n\n193\n00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.560\nSo that's kind of a reminder\nof using both of these.\n\n194\n00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.730\nBut decision makers really\ndo need to understand\n\n195\n00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:26.680\nthat part of the process as we\nstart to take a look here, okay?\n\n196\n00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.640\nSo that is really the beginning.\n\n197\n00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.710\nNow I had mentioned something a little\nbit earlier where we were talking about\n\n198\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:37.270\nthe idea of, now that we have this,\na lot of time with the MSI,\n\n199\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.700\nthough, we still run\ninto some issues here.\n\n200\n00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.000\nAnd it has to do with\nthe idea of updating,\n\n201\n00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.180\nis what ends up happening here, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.270\nSo, we've got to actually figure out here,\nwith the end of MSI, when we download this\n\n203\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:56.870\nthing, and we do that, you don't know\nhow old the MSI really is, okay?\n\n204\n00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.210\nIt could actually be several months old,\n\n205\n00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.820\nin terms of the process\nof things going on.\n\n206\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.220\nSo if we download that MSI,\nit might be from six months ago.\n\n207\n00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.020\nIt's very possible, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.160\nOr it could be from two months ago.\n\n209\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.340\nOr it could be from eight months ago,\nwe don't really know.\n\n210\n00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.460\nAnd that now means that after an MSI\ngets installed on a computer,\n\n211\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.930\nyou normally do have to run\nthe updating of that product,\n\n212\n00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.690\nwhich normally comes through\nthe automatic updates to do so.\n\n213\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.330\nBut that means it's more time that\nyou're waiting, after the updates end up\n\n214\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.610\nhappening, after everything else is\ngoing on that's what goes on, okay?\n\n215\n00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.390\nSo that's where you have to kind of\npay attention at that point too.\n\n216\n00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.990\nSo when you're actually doing this,\nthat MSI may be the way that you choose\n\n217\n00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.960\nto control it, but it means that you\ndo have to worry about updating.\n\n218\n00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:51.830\nThe click to run, though, the C2R,\nit normally when you download it from\n\n219\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.300\nthe distribution network on\nOffice 365 on the cloud up there.\n\n220\n00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.020\n&gt;&gt; You're getting the most\nup to date information,\n\n221\n00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.990\nyou don't have to worry\nof that stale version.\n\n222\n00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:07.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, the very fact is\nin the click to run modeling or\n\n223\n00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.090\nwhat we wanna call it there, there are\nparticular way of deferring those channels\n\n224\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.960\nthat they do the updates here.\n\n225\n00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.960\nIs that you're never actually going to\nend up getting an old version of this.\n\n226\n00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.340\nSo if you download today,\n\n227\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.540\nit's the latest version that's as of\ntoday, okay, that's pretty much it.\n\n228\n00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.490\nSo when you download it, you're never\ngonna get the one that's from six months\n\n229\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.600\nago, it's always gonna be the latest one.\n\n230\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.190\nAnd that technology is really\nhelpful in terms of updating.\n\n231\n00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.840\nBecause it will look on your computer and\nit will end up seeing, hey,\n\n232\n00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:44.320\nyou've got a version of Office\ninstalled on here from three weeks ago.\n\n233\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.220\nAnd then, when you download, when it\nchecks, it goes, let me go ahead and\n\n234\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.060\ndownload this.\n\n235\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.070\nBut then, it actually does a differential\nto where it says, all right,\n\n236\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.890\nhere's what's different from here and\n\n237\n00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.600\nmaybe only pull those downloads\ndown in the way that you need them.\n\n238\n00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.250\nSo you don't always have to actually\nreinstall it, but it will check.\n\n239\n00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.720\nNow if you don't have it, it will install\nthe whole thing, but if you do already\n\n240\n00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.240\nhave it, it will just download what's\ndifferent, and that makes it much quicker\n\n241\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.960\nnot only for the deployment aspect of it,\nbut for updating, and for\n\n242\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:19.320\neverything else and for managing, a lot\nsimpler for us to be able to do this.\n\n243\n00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.400\nAlong with that, of course,\n\n244\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.750\ngoes the idea here, that every subscriber\nof course has access to normally five\n\n245\n00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.428\ninstalls regardless of what\nmachines that they put it on.\n\n246\n00:13:27.428 --> 00:13:31.210\nSo you don't even have to manage for\nactivation anymore and that makes it\n\n247\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:37.250\na good process for us when we start to\nthink about that idea of using this, okay?\n\n248\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.920\nSo there is that idea of using\nthis install process to help us\n\n249\n00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.510\nwhen we start choosing which one to do.\n\n250\n00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.240\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, email is such an integral\npart of our daily business function.\n\n251\n00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.390\nSo, when we look at Office, what do we\nneed to know before we get started?\n\n252\n00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, Office itself, right?\n\n253\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.430\nWhen we start centering\nin on the idea of email,\n\n254\n00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.550\nis we're gonna use a particular\nproduct called Outlook.\n\n255\n00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.820\nIn the past Outlook has been,\n\n256\n00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.730\nwell, at least to 50,50 chance\nof getting installed correctly.\n\n257\n00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.222\nBack in 2003,\nyou really have to know a little bit more,\n\n258\n00:14:10.222 --> 00:14:14.876\nyou had not only know like the username\nand the account password, but there might\n\n259\n00:14:14.876 --> 00:14:19.418\nhave been a point when it didn't connect\nexactly, perfectly the first time.\n\n260\n00:14:19.418 --> 00:14:22.704\nThat you might have actually also\nneeded to know the server name,\n\n261\n00:14:22.704 --> 00:14:26.003\npossibly even entering the correct port,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n262\n00:14:26.003 --> 00:14:29.110\nSo it was a little bit of a challenge.\n\n263\n00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.240\nNow as of course time\nstarted moving forward and\n\n264\n00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.300\nthe different exchange products\nthat were out there as well and\n\n265\n00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.970\nOutlook, it started changing to where you\ndon't really have to do much anymore.\n\n266\n00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.470\nThe only thing that the user normally\nneeds to know is normally their own\n\n267\n00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.490\nemail address.\n\n268\n00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.680\nAnd it may ask them for a password\ndepending on how everything is set up.\n\n269\n00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.080\nSo let's take for\nan example that you log into your domain.\n\n270\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.940\nOkay, and once you're logged in there and\nthen you go and download the Microsoft\n\n271\n00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.640\ninstall, the Office 2016 install,\nthere's two possibilities here.\n\n272\n00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.389\nOne, it could say, look, you've already\nlogged in to this machine with this email,\n\n273\n00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:10.056\nlet me go out and\nfind that particular address and\n\n274\n00:15:10.056 --> 00:15:14.567\nsee if we actually have it connected for\nemail to actually go ahead and configure.\n\n275\n00:15:14.567 --> 00:15:17.971\nBut if not, that's all you have to do\nis actually find the correct email\n\n276\n00:15:17.971 --> 00:15:21.232\naddress and you're off and\nyou're ready to go to be able to do this.\n\n277\n00:15:21.232 --> 00:15:25.747\nSo most users they're not gonna need\nto know a whole bunch of technical\n\n278\n00:15:25.747 --> 00:15:28.360\nknowledge to get it connected.\n\n279\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.730\nSo I always liken it to\nthe first time that I\n\n280\n00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.230\nactually tried to get my\nwork email on my phone.\n\n281\n00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.956\nIt took a little bit of finagling.\n\n282\n00:15:35.956 --> 00:15:36.960\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't so easy.\n\n283\n00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it wasn't so easy but\n\n284\n00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.380\nthat kind of reminds me of the very\nfirst time I tried to connect\n\n285\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.940\njust to Outlook itself on my own\npersonal laptop, not a work machine.\n\n286\n00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.220\nI was like,\n\n287\n00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.905\nI've got to actually be able to know a\nlittle bit more data to get it connected.\n\n288\n00:15:50.905 --> 00:15:53.465\n&gt;&gt; The evolution of email has\nbeen pretty significant over\n\n289\n00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:54.195\nthe past few years, Ronnie.\n\n290\n00:15:54.195 --> 00:15:55.591\nI mean, like you said, think about it.\n\n291\n00:15:55.591 --> 00:15:58.759\nWe used to have to know\nthe ports that we were using for\n\n292\n00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:02.290\nthat particular email server,\nthe mail server's name.\n\n293\n00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.458\nAnd now it's pretty simple,\nespecially even on our smart phones,\n\n294\n00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:09.600\nthey usually have this\nvery common mail solution,\n\n295\n00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.530\nit's just a button that you click,\nYahoo, Google, Outlook, whatever.\n\n296\n00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it fills it in and\ntells you exactly what you need to know.\n\n297\n00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:17.680\n&gt;&gt; It reconfigure, exactly.\n\n298\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.700\n&gt;&gt; Which is really helpful,\n\n299\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.230\nbecause it works the same today when you\nhave Outlook installed on the machine.\n\n300\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.600\nSo let's go through what a typical\nuser would normally have to do.\n\n301\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.120\nSo let's take a look at my machine here,\nand that will help us to get started.\n\n302\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So on this machine,\n\n303\n00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.590\nthis is Joey's personal workstation.\n\n304\n00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.420\nAnd all Joey has to do,\nif he hasn't run it yet.\n\n305\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.100\nBecause I don't believe he has, since I've\nbeen logged in as Joey the whole day.\n\n306\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.110\nIs, he needs to look for\nhis Outlook client.\n\n307\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.500\nWhich is gonna be right here, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.930\nOutlook 2016 is what we're looking for.\n\n309\n00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.160\nAnd he just simply runs this.\n\n310\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.650\nNow, the very first time, it is actually\ngoing to give us this here, and\n\n311\n00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.190\nnotice what it did.\n\n312\n00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:03.140\nIt automatically found, look at that,\nme, or Joey Fatone here.\n\n313\n00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.970\nRight here,\nconnect Outlook to Office 365 and\n\n314\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.820\nthat is because that's\nthe account that I'm viewing.\n\n315\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.540\nIt is also the account that I'm currently\nlogged in on this domain machine on,\n\n316\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.910\nfrom this point I can connect.\n\n317\n00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.150\nNow, I want to take a look,\n\n318\n00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.320\njust briefly right here behind my\nhead just a little bit on the screen.\n\n319\n00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.560\nAnd notice where it says\nconnect to a different account.\n\n320\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.300\nSo if you didn't want this for\nyour work, well then you would\n\n321\n00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.400\nactually select right there, and that\nwould give you another option instead.\n\n322\n00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.770\nBut if you are actually logged in,\nand it defines your own email address,\n\n323\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.890\nthis is the one that you're gonna end\nup using, all I have to do is click\n\n324\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.740\nconnect here, and then it will start\nto see if everything is set up.\n\n325\n00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.460\nSo in this domain inside of the cloud,\nOffice 365.\n\n326\n00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.310\nIt's already set all that other stuff\nup that uses what we call auto-discover\n\n327\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.960\nto really help and make the connection and\ndo everything that we need to.\n\n328\n00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.500\nThe great thing is once you\nactually have the email and\n\n329\n00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.170\neverything that you're doing here.\n\n330\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.720\nIf you have previous emails\nit should come right in,\n\n331\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.150\nyou shouldn't have to worry about it.\n\n332\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.690\nAnd so it doesn't matter if you\nare actually on another machine.\n\n333\n00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.880\nOkay, somewhere else and\nyou had connected there.\n\n334\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.950\nYou don't have to go to that\nmachine to do anything.\n\n335\n00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:14.620\n&gt;&gt; No more manual importing\nof those PST files?\n\n336\n00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm not gonna say you\ndon't have to do that, okay?\n\n337\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.970\nIt depends on the age of your machine and\nhow old those particular emails are.\n\n338\n00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:28.730\nYou might find out that yes, Office stores\nit for a good amount of time, but it\n\n339\n00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.410\nmay not actually store every little thing,\nespecially when you brought those in,\n\n340\n00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.070\nlet's say, that you archived\nthem from another account, and\n\n341\n00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.960\nthen archived them again\nfrom another account.\n\n342\n00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.830\nBut that's pretty much it, okay,\nis what you'll end up seeing here, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.680\nSo, in a moment, when everything\nactually connects in here it goes.\n\n344\n00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.730\nNow what we actually end up\nseeing what it's asking me for.\n\n345\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.550\nSo it at least made the initial\nconnection that we needed to, and\n\n346\n00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.060\nnow it has where it's for\nmy organization, and\n\n347\n00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.490\nyou can see right there, there's my\noffice code, demo code icon that we have.\n\n348\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.518\n&gt;&gt; Really fancy and creative.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little fancy isn't it?\n\n349\n00:19:01.518 --> 00:19:06.610\nAnd there's Joey, and this shows me that\nI'm connecting to my Office 365 account.\n\n350\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.650\nAnd let's see if I can actually\nget connected in here.\n\n351\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:15.310\nAnd this is all dependent on my typing, so\nif this doesn't work it's probably a typo.\n\n352\n00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.190\n&gt;&gt; We know who to blame.\n\n353\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n354\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.500\nAnd let me connect,\nsign in, and there we go.\n\n355\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.750\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n&gt;&gt; So there it is and\n\n356\n00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.750\nI just,\nI didn't even have to click connect again.\n\n357\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:31.800\nNotice now it's loading my profile and\nthen it's retrieving my mailbox settings.\n\n358\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.330\nSo if there were any special settings that\nthe network administrator had set up.\n\n359\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.800\n&gt;&gt; Any kind of rules I'd\npreviously created and so forth.\n\n360\n00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.280\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\nit should actually bring it all in here.\n\n361\n00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.390\nAnd now it is beginning to setup\nthe local copy of my mailbox.\n\n362\n00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.240\nAnd there it is.\n\n363\n00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.490\nI click Close.\n\n364\n00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.160\nAnd in a moment, it's updating my mailbox.\n\n365\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.740\nAnd now it's refreshing.\n\n366\n00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.320\n&gt;&gt; You have it?\n\n367\n00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.829\n&gt;&gt; And look at all the mail that's been\ncoming in here to my box over a period\n\n368\n00:19:55.829 --> 00:19:56.440\nof time.\n\n369\n00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.010\nAnd a lot of this is, well,\ntesting that we of course have been doing.\n\n370\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.500\nAnd not only me, somebody else\nis also using this account too.\n\n371\n00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.230\nBut that's where it actually gets set up,\nright?\n\n372\n00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.890\nSo now we have everything in there,\n24 different emails, any sent items,\n\n373\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.800\nlet me check, I've sent items\nactually have gone to me and\n\n374\n00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.280\nas well as Devon and this, has it?\n\n375\n00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.510\nI've even got some junk mail and,\nI was like,\n\n376\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.780\ndo I have some junk\nmail actually in there?\n\n377\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.180\nThat'd be pretty good.\n\n378\n00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.380\nBut there we go.\n\n379\n00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.680\nSo, most users, what do they need?\n\n380\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.400\nThey need to know their\nOffice 365 username,\n\n381\n00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.840\nwhich is gonna be normally their email\naddress, as well as their password to\n\n382\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.480\nconnect in if that's what they're\nactually setting up to do.\n\n383\n00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.460\nNow, later on, we're also gonna end up\nseeing a little bit later in the series\n\n384\n00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.070\nhere where we've also set up for\nmulti-factor authentication, as well.\n\n385\n00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.690\nSo if you don't want to do that, you can\nuse the multi-factor authentication,\n\n386\n00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.960\nif that is something\nthat you choose to do.\n\n387\n00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:57.790\nBut notice, very simple in terms of\nthe client having to set anything up.\n\n388\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.780\nThe kind of big drawback here for\n\n389\n00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.740\nthe client, is if they have the right\nsubscription that gives them the ability.\n\n390\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.940\nTo download and\nuse the Office Client itself.\n\n391\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.070\nIf their subscription doesn't have it,\nwell they wont be able to have access to\n\n392\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.570\nOutlook and they wont be able to configure\nit the way that we just did right here.\n\n393\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.780\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n394\n00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.870\nthat leaves us then to another product\nthat we definitely need to get familiar\n\n395\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:25.480\nwith, which is something dealing more\nwith the idea of collaboration then.\n\n396\n00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.080\nOkay, so when we start to take a look at\nwhat we are moving on to is what is called\n\n397\n00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.370\nSkype for business client.\n\n398\n00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.720\nAs we are beginning to take a look at.\n\n399\n00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.900\n&gt;&gt; Now, in addition to email, our video\nteleconferencing is becoming such\n\n400\n00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:43.450\na popular option for people to be\nable to communicate expanding across.\n\n401\n00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.840\nVarious broad distances, countries.\n\n402\n00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.830\nIt's a pretty efficient way to\ncommunicate here, Ronnie, so\n\n403\n00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.910\nwhat do we have to do to get this set up?\n\n404\n00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, normally you would think\nthat, hey, I'm gonna deploy Office, and\n\n405\n00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.380\nthis should come right in\nwith the account itself.\n\n406\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.200\nSometimes it does, but it also depends on\nwhen you got the subscription, and what\n\n407\n00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.250\nyour level of your subscription is gonna\nbe, whether or not you have access to it.\n\n408\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.290\nBut if you do, all we have to do is\nconnect back to our Office portal, and\n\n409\n00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.190\nthis will give us that part.\n\n410\n00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:14.920\nSo I've already got it installed, but\n\n411\n00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:20.470\nlet me at least show you here,\nwhich I need to portal.office.com.\n\n412\n00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.480\nI couldn't remember what the portal was.\n\n413\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:30.583\nFrom here, I want to select Joey,\nand then type in his password again.\n\n414\n00:22:34.866 --> 00:22:35.744\nAnd sign in.\n\n415\n00:22:38.806 --> 00:22:43.250\nSo once I actually sign in,\nwe need to actually say, hey, look.\n\n416\n00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.380\nIf the user doesn't have this.\n\n417\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.660\nAll we are going to do is we\nhave a couple of choices, right?\n\n418\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.700\nSo either the user himself is going\nto be able to install the client, and\n\n419\n00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.850\nall we have to do at this\npoint is we can simply go\n\n420\n00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:01.509\nup here to the upper right-hand corner,\nselect Other Installs.\n\n421\n00:23:03.662 --> 00:23:06.714\nAnd once they select other installs,\nif it's installed,\n\n422\n00:23:06.714 --> 00:23:10.850\nyou'll pretty much see it right here\nwhere it says Skype for Business.\n\n423\n00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:16.280\nBut if they do not have it, you can\nnow go over to the left-hand side and\n\n424\n00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.220\nunderneath Software,\nselect Skype for Business.\n\n425\n00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.420\nand if that is going to show up,\n\n426\n00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.091\nthey now have that ability\nto download it right away.\n\n427\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:30.539\nThen it will install for them and all\nthey will need is gonna be their Office\n\n428\n00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:34.220\n365 username as well as their\npassword to get connected in.\n\n429\n00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.580\nIf everybody is actually\ncollaborating through it,\n\n430\n00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.790\nit should set up perfectly fine.\n\n431\n00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:44.329\nThe other option behind this, or I\nshouldn't say other option, the other way,\n\n432\n00:23:44.329 --> 00:23:47.090\nof course,\nis that if you're on a Macbook here.\n\n433\n00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:52.210\nThe great thing is they've recently\nupdated this to show everything that we\n\n434\n00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:57.570\nwanted it to which is great because at one\npoint, Mac users had to kind of default\n\n435\n00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:03.740\nback to what was called Microsoft Link,\nwhich was actually from Office 2011.\n\n436\n00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.770\nBack into that too.\n\n437\n00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.805\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it wasn't too long ago, I can\nrecall installing that beta version and\n\n438\n00:24:08.805 --> 00:24:11.050\nit seem to work pretty swell, Ronnie.\n\n439\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:11.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n440\n00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.574\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was-\n\n441\n00:24:12.574 --> 00:24:13.560\n&gt;&gt; So we decided to what?\n\n442\n00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.606\nJust go ahead and\n\n443\n00:24:14.606 --> 00:24:18.100\nadd it on as a normal feature then?\n&gt;&gt; I think it just took a little bit\n\n444\n00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.040\nlonger for them to develop it, right?\nSo at least that product,\n\n445\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.760\nbut now it's actually fully developed and\nbaked in for even Mac users.\n\n446\n00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.204\nSo the great thing is you're\nno longer limited now in your\n\n447\n00:24:29.204 --> 00:24:32.005\norganization whether\npeople have Macbooks or\n\n448\n00:24:32.005 --> 00:24:35.968\nwhether they have regular\nWindows PCs that they're working on.\n\n449\n00:24:35.968 --> 00:24:40.833\nIt give us a great solution to do\ninstant messaging, video collaboration,\n\n450\n00:24:40.833 --> 00:24:42.284\nphones, you name it.\n\n451\n00:24:42.284 --> 00:24:43.518\n&gt;&gt; We use it quite a bit here at ITPro.\n\n452\n00:24:43.518 --> 00:24:46.246\n&gt;&gt; We do, we tend to actually\nuse it everywhere just about.\n\n453\n00:24:46.246 --> 00:24:49.819\nSo it really is a nice thing\nthat is set up, and ready for\n\n454\n00:24:49.819 --> 00:24:52.260\nus to go in in collaboration.\n\n455\n00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.440\nIt really does help quite a bit, and\nin business, it's really a great product.\n\n456\n00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.490\nSo this is one of those things that we\ncan actually do to make that happen.\n\n457\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:04.150\nNow if you're running the other way,\nright?\n\n458\n00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:08.570\nIf you're doing the manual deployment,\nhere's what you would also have to do.\n\n459\n00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:12.670\nI'll at least show you a kind\nof setup that has to go on here.\n\n460\n00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:17.870\nSo if you choose to run the ODT,\nthe Office Deployment Tool,\n\n461\n00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.689\nitself, you'll need to make\nsure that you download it.\n\n462\n00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.720\nAnd then from that point,\nyou go ahead and you get it set up.\n\n463\n00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.017\nAnd I need to make sure I go to\nthe right folder here before I tell you.\n\n464\n00:25:31.017 --> 00:25:35.664\nLet me scroll over to this guy so\nI can show you the configuration\n\n465\n00:25:35.664 --> 00:25:40.150\nfiles that you want to make sure\nthat you understand and see.\n\n466\n00:25:43.484 --> 00:25:47.313\nAll right, so inside of that ODT,\nonce you extract it,\n\n467\n00:25:47.313 --> 00:25:49.684\nit's gonna give you a setup file.\n\n468\n00:25:49.684 --> 00:25:52.400\nLet me get to the right one, there we go.\n\n469\n00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.070\nIt's gonna give you a setup file,\nand then by default,\n\n470\n00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:59.676\nit's gonna also create\na configuration file for you.\n\n471\n00:25:59.676 --> 00:26:01.824\nBut if you've already installed Office,\n\n472\n00:26:01.824 --> 00:26:04.158\nyou don't need to install\neverything again.\n\n473\n00:26:04.158 --> 00:26:08.350\nWhat you really need is to\nmake sure that you go back and\n\n474\n00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.250\nuninstall only Skype for Business.\n\n475\n00:26:12.955 --> 00:26:15.742\nAnd I'm trying to make sure\nthat get to the right one here.\n\n476\n00:26:15.742 --> 00:26:19.538\nSo I need to actually find that\nsetting for Skype for Business.\n\n477\n00:26:19.538 --> 00:26:21.059\nApparently I shut out of everything.\n\n478\n00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:23.498\nLet me see if I can get\nto it one more time.\n\n479\n00:26:26.655 --> 00:26:27.190\nOkay.\n\n480\n00:26:29.604 --> 00:26:30.428\nIs right here.\n\n481\n00:26:35.387 --> 00:26:37.090\nI'm using Wordpad, though.\n\n482\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.830\nIt's not too bad, but at this point\n\n483\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:45.470\nit does tell you I'm actually installing\nOffice Pro Plus on the retail version.\n\n484\n00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.770\nNow look at all these apps that I\nwould normally be excluding here.\n\n485\n00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:53.630\nSo the only thing I would probably do at\nthis point is I would actually exclude\n\n486\n00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:54.930\nall these other apps.\n\n487\n00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.090\nExcept for one,\nwhich would be the Skype for Business app.\n\n488\n00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:01.314\nWhich I don't actually have,\nI didn't actually load it on here.\n\n489\n00:27:01.314 --> 00:27:04.692\nBut you do need to look up this ID, okay?\n\n490\n00:27:04.692 --> 00:27:08.245\nSo go out there onto the Internet,\nlook for\n\n491\n00:27:08.245 --> 00:27:12.210\nthe ODT with\nthe configuration.xml options.\n\n492\n00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.060\nAnd then all you would have to\ndo is actually make sure that\n\n493\n00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.860\nyou exclude everything except for\nthe Skype for Business as well, and\n\n494\n00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.610\nthat should actually\nallow you to install it.\n\n495\n00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:25.070\nAnd that's probably why it actually\ndid install on this computer.\n\n496\n00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.150\nI was trying to remember why that\none actually did end up getting onto\n\n497\n00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.500\nthis computer here.\n\n498\n00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.420\nSo this is what it was.\n\n499\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.010\nI even had it where it was\nsupposed to be Excel only, but\n\n500\n00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:38.990\nbecause I forgot Skype for Business,\nIt actually did end up getting installed.\n\n501\n00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.330\nSo that's one of the things\nthat you can do as well, and\n\n502\n00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:46.880\nthat will help you then, to limit that\ninstall process and make it really fast.\n\n503\n00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.850\nInstalling one product is actually\nvery quick inside of Office,\n\n504\n00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.890\nif you do this, instead of downloading and\nthen installing everything again.\n\n505\n00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.895\nSo using something like that is really\nhelpful for the install of Skype for\n\n506\n00:27:58.895 --> 00:27:59.937\nBusiness, okay?\n\n507\n00:27:59.937 --> 00:28:02.515\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, I know we have other\nproducts that we really need to cover.\n\n508\n00:28:02.515 --> 00:28:04.313\nBut we are running out of time, so\n\n509\n00:28:04.313 --> 00:28:07.730\nI'm afraid I'm gonna have to be\nthe bearer of bad news here.\n\n510\n00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds good.\n\n511\n00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.100\nWe'll go on to a part two then.\n\n512\n00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, so ladies and\ngentlemen, thank you for tuning in.\n\n513\n00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.070\nBut stayed tuned,\nwe do have a part two headed your way.\n\n514\n00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.560\nFor this show, I'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n515\n00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.460\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n516\n00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.360\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n517\n00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.270\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n518\n00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:29.948\n[MUSIC]\n\n519\n00:28:29.948 -->

They mention the different licenses available and the assignment of those licenses are based on what the user will need to be able to do.  According to the team, so users will use only web based access like Office Online; others may need to download and install Office 2016, all this is done before any assignment and during the planning stage.  They also show the Office Configuration Analyzer tool to help out with post planning effectiveness too.",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.458\nWelcome to IT Pro TV I'm\nyour host Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:11.918\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:15.820\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your enabling\nOffice 365 Services series.\n\n4\n00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.020\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.010\nThis is actually part two, where we will\ncontinue to plan for our Office clients.\n\n6\n00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.470\nAnd with us today, in the studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.710\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.070\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back on,\nas we continue to take a look at this\n\n9\n00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.710\nidea of planning for our clients to\nbe able to connect to Office 365.\n\n10\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.140\nSo in part one,\nwe did talk a bit about deployment, and\n\n11\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.710\nwe also of course took a look at\nconfiguring Outlook just a little bit,\n\n12\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.370\nas well as how to get Skype for\nBusiness on to the computers.\n\n13\n00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.760\nThere's not a ton of challenges\nin that aspect, right?\n\n14\n00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.590\nAs far as getting anything installed,\npicking which deployment you're gonna use.\n\n15\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.390\nA little bit more challenging,\nmaking sure that we can see everything.\n\n16\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.460\nThose are things that we've actually\nalready covered in our series so far.\n\n17\n00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.569\nBut now we actually have to\ntalk about something else here,\n\n18\n00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:14.924\nwhich may be a little bit more\nchallenging which is the very fact\n\n19\n00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:19.382\nthat there are different\nsubscription plans to Office 365.\n\n20\n00:01:19.382 --> 00:01:24.810\nAnd one of those, the types of plans\nthat we actually need to talk about\n\n21\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.800\nof course is the Office Online\ntype of subscription too, okay.\n\n22\n00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.350\nSo some of the plans of course,\ngive you that ability to not only\n\n23\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.280\nuse the Office Online, or the Office\nproducts that we have available.\n\n24\n00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.330\nBut some of them also,\n\n25\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.020\nalong with that give you the ability to\nuse what we call Office Online itself.\n\n26\n00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.010\nAnd then there's other plans that\nactually only have Office Online.\n\n27\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.590\nSo let me go ahead and show what I'm\ntalking about as far as Office Online.\n\n28\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:02.060\nSo I'm simply gonna connect back to\nthe Office portal here, Office 365 portal.\n\n29\n00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:08.470\nAt least possibly if\nthe typing doesn't kill me.\n\n30\n00:02:10.624 --> 00:02:15.949\nAnd once we get connected in,\nyou'll notice that in the number of tiles\n\n31\n00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:21.880\nthat I have available I have access to\nbe able to check my email here okay.\n\n32\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.860\nI also have access to, OneNote, Excel,\nPowerPoint, Word is another one.\n\n33\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.840\nSo those are kinda the basic and primary\ntypes of programs that I have access to.\n\n34\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.700\nIf I go and\ntake a look at the installs and\n\n35\n00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.850\nsee what's actually\ninstalled on my computer.\n\n36\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.870\nAlong with this,\nyou can actually see that on the computer,\n\n37\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.200\nI have access to a little bit more.\n\n38\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.320\nOneNote right here is available.\n\n39\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.700\nAccess itself.\n\n40\n00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.240\nPublisher is also available\nin this particular\n\n41\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.180\nsubscription type of account too.\n\n42\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.740\n&gt;&gt; Both great pieces of\nsoftware I love to use.\n\n43\n00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.630\n&gt;&gt; Publisher?\n\n44\n00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n45\n00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.560\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n46\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.432\n&gt;&gt; It hasn't been a while.\n\n47\n00:03:03.432 --> 00:03:04.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is pretty cool.\n\n48\n00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.430\nI have kids so instead of buying\nbirthday cards online like a template.\n\n49\n00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.430\nI just create my own.\n\n50\n00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n51\n00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.880\nSo, here you have OneNote but\n\n52\n00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.880\nnotice that publisher, I don't think\nit's actually up here on this one.\n\n53\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.500\nYou do have access to a lot.\n\n54\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.050\nThe difference, though is, if your\nparticular account only gives you access\n\n55\n00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.950\nto the ones online you are not\ngonna be able to download those.\n\n56\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.590\nYou do have a mix within a company where\nyou will choose certain subscriptions for\n\n57\n00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.020\ncertain people and other ones for\n\n58\n00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.250\nothers and that's the way that\nwe do it right here at ITProTV.\n\n59\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.820\nNot everybody needs this\naccount right here.\n\n60\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.860\nThis is kind of the most expensive\none that we have available.\n\n61\n00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.130\nBut I'll tell you the truth,\nI don't use things like PowerApps or\n\n62\n00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.930\nFlow or Business BI and Dynamics 365.\n\n63\n00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.008\n&gt;&gt; I don't either Ronnie.\n\n64\n00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:03.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's not an account that\nI would need on a day to day basis.\n\n65\n00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.310\nSo, we can essentially take a look at\nthe different accounts and say, all right,\n\n66\n00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.660\nhere's possibly what Ronnie would need and\nwhat we want him to have access to.\n\n67\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.900\nBut we may also end up finding out that\nwe have certain people where they go,\n\n68\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.060\nI really don't have my own laptop.\n\n69\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.830\nI really don't need that,\nI like using the web apps.\n\n70\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.382\nWell, it's simple enough, most people\ncan navigate through these things.\n\n71\n00:04:27.382 --> 00:04:31.124\nNotice that?\nThat's exactly like every other web based\n\n72\n00:04:31.124 --> 00:04:33.430\nclient that's out there.\n\n73\n00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.460\nYou can get access to it.\n\n74\n00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.170\nAnd this will work just fine for them too.\n\n75\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.890\n&gt;&gt; Now as long as they have a good,\nreliable Internet connection.\n\n76\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n77\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.820\nYou normally do need\nan Internet connection.\n\n78\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.126\nSo if these are people that are not\ngonna be connected at some point,\n\n79\n00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:52.186\nthen those particular types of people will\nalso need something like this where they\n\n80\n00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:54.250\ncan download Office as well.\n\n81\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.690\nBut here you can see even on Word Online,\nright,\n\n82\n00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.720\nthis is another one where it really\ndoes look very similar but you will find\n\n83\n00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.140\nout on some of these though, especially,\nwhen we start to take a look at them,\n\n84\n00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.640\nis that they won't be as feature-rich as\nthe ones installed onto the computer.\n\n85\n00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.630\nSo there may be certain things where\nyou go, I know I can do this and\n\n86\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.700\nthen all of a sudden you find\nout something you can't do it.\n\n87\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.370\nAnd I've ran into that,\nwhen it comes down to Excel.\n\n88\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.340\nI used to use Excel quite a bit,\nand then once you actually select,\n\n89\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.100\nso here's a document that I've\ncreated here, there's nothing in it.\n\n90\n00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.030\nBut even right here, on some of the stuff,\n\n91\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.370\nI'd have to select Edit and\nthen once we open it see,\n\n92\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.250\nit actually opened it\non the client instead.\n\n93\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.610\nLet me change it here.\n\n94\n00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.140\nWell I get access to these tools and\nit does look like a lot.\n\n95\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.150\nBut this is still limited in\ncomparison to what we normally\n\n96\n00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.440\nsee inside of the actual normal program\nthat's installed on the computer.\n\n97\n00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.150\nSo in this aspect,\nthis is where business decision-makers\n\n98\n00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.940\nas well as even the IT team\nwould need to be a bit more\n\n99\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.930\nfamiliar then with the different types\nof subscriptions that are available.\n\n100\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.510\nAnd that way once they\nhave that subscription,\n\n101\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.650\nthen they actually know\nwhich ones to assign.\n\n102\n00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.030\nNow when it comes out to a divide,\nI click on Joey, and\n\n103\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.060\nthen select View account here.\n\n104\n00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.690\nLet me see if I can view that.\n\n105\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.820\nNormally where you would go is select\nright here on the View subscriptions.\n\n106\n00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.114\nNow I'm not clicking on this because\nit may actually reveal some payment\n\n107\n00:06:36.114 --> 00:06:39.098\ninformation so that's why I'm not\nclicking on it at this point.\n\n108\n00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:43.306\nBut if you actually select that you\nactually see what subscription and\n\n109\n00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:47.938\nthen if you need to change that all of\na sudden Cherokee says I'm not gonna ever\n\n110\n00:06:47.938 --> 00:06:51.306\nuse the Office client,\nI'm not actually download it.\n\n111\n00:06:51.306 --> 00:06:54.649\nSo then I can change that and\nsave the company a little bit of money but\n\n112\n00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.190\nCherokee still has exactly what she needs.\n\n113\n00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.110\nThis is good in terms of people that\nare contractors that may come in for\n\n114\n00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.810\nus, part time employees, interns.\n\n115\n00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.130\nUnless there's something specific that\nthey really need, this may be enough.\n\n116\n00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.410\nAnd the nice thing about the majority of\nthis is that you might even be able to\n\n117\n00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.130\nget away with something that's almost\nlike what we'll call a free account\n\n118\n00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.530\nwhere they can actually just use that and\nnot really even have to connect in.\n\n119\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.310\nNow, if you decide to have collaboration,\n\n120\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.790\nthen you'll have to start to\nspend a little bit more money.\n\n121\n00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:30.420\nBut overall though, using the Office\nOnline essentially for us, it really is.\n\n122\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.180\nFree versions can get access to it but\nthen if you actually do need more\n\n123\n00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.965\nfunctionality on that, paid versions will\ngive you full functionality to everything.\n\n124\n00:07:38.965 --> 00:07:43.440\nAnd most people are actually used\nto being able to do by comparison.\n\n125\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.205\nBut that is a decision and that is part\nof the planning that you and of course\n\n126\n00:07:48.205 --> 00:07:53.620\ndecision-makers in your company would\nneed to think about if you continue on.\n\n127\n00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.843\nThey're not, you can kind of\ndo the blind thing, which is,\n\n128\n00:07:56.843 --> 00:08:00.335\nall right, everybody in my\ncompany's gonna get an E5 account.\n\n129\n00:08:00.335 --> 00:08:02.557\nWell, that can get very expensive-\n&gt;&gt; Costly.\n\n130\n00:08:02.557 --> 00:08:04.848\n&gt;&gt; Very, very quickly.\n\n131\n00:08:04.848 --> 00:08:09.415\nAnd it's a shame, if all of a sudden you\nfind out 85% of people are never gonna use\n\n132\n00:08:09.415 --> 00:08:11.940\nevery single product that's in it.\n\n133\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.920\nWhy not fit it and\nmake it suit your needs, and pay less?\n\n134\n00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.570\nAnd actually get the most\nbenefit out of it instead.\n\n135\n00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:23.180\nSo that's kind of a key for us,\nwhen we start to take a look at Office.\n\n136\n00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.860\nEverything bills down to money, right?\n\n137\n00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.550\n&gt;&gt; In this model it does okay.\n\n138\n00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.630\nSubscription based cloud based things.\n\n139\n00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.570\nWhenever we start doing this type of\nservice it does boil down to money and\n\n140\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.990\nefficiency and\nthat's why we tend to go with it.\n\n141\n00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.390\nThe other way of just even doing\nthe simple email thing right\n\n142\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.400\nWe hire somebody that's good at exchange.\n\n143\n00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.270\nWe hire somebody that's good at deploying.\n\n144\n00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.790\nWe start doing that,\nit can add up very quickly.\n\n145\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.020\nBut here, without really having to do\nanything except for start a subscription.\n\n146\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.870\nAnd for me to stand up the domain\nthat we're gonna use for\n\n147\n00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.420\nthe Office 365 here,\nour Office Pro Democo.\n\n148\n00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.530\nThat really didn't take that much.\n\n149\n00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.740\nBut each subscription, it adds up over\nmonth and time and that's why for\n\n150\n00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.620\nus right now we're only using\ntwo subscriptions really.\n\n151\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:19.620\nWe've got a third one that's available to\nus, but is actually on that free plan for\n\n152\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.155\nright now or maybe even like 12 bucks\na month or $8 a month, I can't remember.\n\n153\n00:09:24.155 --> 00:09:28.460\nBut, that adds up when you actually\nadd along with what this E5 is.\n\n154\n00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.480\nAnd you start adding a couple months\nat a time just using this and\n\n155\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.040\ngetting it ready for the show,\nit's gonna be several hundred dollars.\n\n156\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.370\nAnd that's just for doing the show and\n\n157\n00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.360\nnot actually doing any real productivity\nin terms of that organization.\n\n158\n00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.920\nSo it's something that you have to\npay attention to if you're going to\n\n159\n00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.390\nbe administrating this as well, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.390\nNow that does lead us to something\nthat we were mentioning as well,\n\n161\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:59.940\nwhich is the idea of, things happen after\nwe install Office products sometimes.\n\n162\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.320\nAnd not everybody will report them.\n\n163\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.630\nNot everybody will actually give you\neverything that you're expecting to have,\n\n164\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.960\nwhen it comes down to\ntroubleshooting Office Products.\n\n165\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.410\nSo, one of the things that we do have the\nability to do, is we can download a tool\n\n166\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:21.590\nfrom Microsoft, that will help us to\ncheck the office configuration itself.\n\n167\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.030\nAnd hence,\nthere is something that is named for\n\n168\n00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:29.480\nthat, which is the Office Configuration\nAnalyzer Tool, is what we have.\n\n169\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is a tool\nthat I can use to help what,\n\n170\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.320\nwith troubleshooting a particular pieces\nof software they have on my network?\n\n171\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.140\nOr what are we looking at?\n\n172\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.790\n&gt;&gt; It is really about Office\nmore than anything else, right?\n\n173\n00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.850\nSo just as people install Office and\n\n174\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.360\nthey get it to run, I've had certain\nthings happen to me over the years.\n\n175\n00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.010\nFresh install,\ngo to click only button, and\n\n176\n00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.500\nit brings up the splash screen for\nme, and it never loads.\n\n177\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.170\nOkay?\n\n178\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.960\nOr it loads, it shows me a page,\nI go to click in to Excel,\n\n179\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.310\nin Excel It closes on me right away.\n\n180\n00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.930\nWell I might be at a complete loss if I'm\n\n181\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.570\njust somebody that's not\nmeant to trouble shoot it.\n\n182\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:13.720\nI might just go, maybe I'm not\nsupposed to use that program, and\n\n183\n00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.630\nthen up leaving it alone.\n\n184\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.490\nAnd now finally after a few months,\nit gets reported up and\n\n185\n00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.930\nsays Hey I've been having\nproblems with this.\n\n186\n00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.950\nAnd you're like how long have\nyou been having problems?\n\n187\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.480\nSix weeks and\n\n188\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.640\nnow your mind is kind of relealing\nlike why did this end up happening?\n\n189\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.170\nWell one of the tools that you\ncould actually end up using\n\n190\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:37.290\nthat might give you a bit more information\nthan expecting the end user to try and\n\n191\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.550\nreport exactly what they're doing here,\nis that tool okay?\n\n192\n00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.520\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that too?\n\n193\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.940\n&gt;&gt; Do we have any pre requisites or\n\n194\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.760\nanything that we need to consider before\nwe go ahead and start using this tool?\n\n195\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes you will but\nas you actually wanna find that out.\n\n196\n00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.080\nI simply went to a search engine and\n\n197\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.690\nI typed in cuz I knew\nwhat it was called here.\n\n198\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.130\nMicrosoft Office configuration\nanalyzer download is what I did.\n\n199\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.530\nAnd that lead me to this page right here.\n\n200\n00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.130\nNow, if you're actually concerned and\n\n201\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.360\nCherokee has a good questionnaire\nabout their requirements.\n\n202\n00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.550\nAll I have to do is\nclick on the plus sign.\n\n203\n00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.210\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n204\n00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.010\n&gt;&gt; And it will normally tell\nme what I need to do and\n\n205\n00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.570\nwhat versions this thing works with too.\n\n206\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.920\nSo it's supported by multiple\noperating systems and\n\n207\n00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.591\nthis one will actually allow me to work\nwith Office 2007 all the way through 2016.\n\n208\n00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.760\nAnd even in Office 2016, even more\nimpressive in both versions, right?\n\n209\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.570\nClick 2 Run or MSI installs.\n\n210\n00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:41.710\nAnd here on the Office CAT 2.2,\nthat's what it's short for,\n\n211\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.130\nOffice Configuration analyzer tool,\nprovides scanning for\n\n212\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.620\nthe following programs.\n\n213\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.550\nThere it actually provides\nthe following programs.\n\n214\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.180\nBut when it comes down to\nthe minimum requirement,\n\n215\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.480\nthis is what you're looking for\nright here.\n\n216\n00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.520\nMost of the time, especially if you're\nrunning Windows 10, it's already\n\n217\n00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.190\ninstalled, so you don't have to worry\nabout it if you're running Server 2016.\n\n218\n00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.640\nYou're probably not gonna have\nto worry about it either.\n\n219\n00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.820\nYou're probably not gonna put Office on\n2016, but it is out there and available,\n\n220\n00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.450\nor you're running anything else.\n\n221\n00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.470\nIf you're not sure,\nmake sure you go back in and install this.\n\n222\n00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:21.042\nMake sure you have that .NET\nframework 4.5 to get it installed.\n\n223\n00:13:23.704 --> 00:13:27.064\nSo we're simply going to click\nthe download button, and\n\n224\n00:13:27.064 --> 00:13:31.360\nnow it's gonna say hey which of\nthese do you want to download?\n\n225\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.010\nOne of course is a readme file,\nI'm not gonna worry about that.\n\n226\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.620\nSimply going to put a check mark and\nthe one I'm going to download.\n\n227\n00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.320\nThen click Next and hopefully here\nthat Next was just behind my head.\n\n228\n00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.690\nWe don't have to actually\ntake a look at it.\n\n229\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.740\nAt least I think, there we go.\n\n230\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.190\nIt should say thank you for\ndownloading, and\n\n231\n00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.730\nit's gonna ask me what do I want to do.\n\n232\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.790\nI'm going to save this, and\n\n233\n00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.000\nI'm simply going to put it in\nmy downloads folder on the PC.\n\n234\n00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.460\nNow it's gonna do a basic security scan.\n\n235\n00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:05.285\nOnce you have it on the computer,\nwe simply follow it through.\n\n236\n00:14:05.285 --> 00:14:10.175\nSelect install and\n\n237\n00:14:10.175 --> 00:14:16.190\nnow simply kind of default letting\ninstall at the end of this,\n\n238\n00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.770\nI'm gonna tell it go ahead and\nlaunch the set up.\n\n239\n00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.189\nAnd let it do what it needs to do.\n\n240\n00:14:23.438 --> 00:14:27.249\nSo now that I'm done with that let me\ngo out and close all these tabs and\n\n241\n00:14:27.249 --> 00:14:30.430\nthat will leave us with a little\nbit easier viewing here.\n\n242\n00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:36.514\nSo now that it's complete,\nI'm going to finish here.\n\n243\n00:14:39.469 --> 00:14:43.088\nHere's a notification and this is\nsomething we definitely need to pay\n\n244\n00:14:43.088 --> 00:14:47.130\nattention to if we're gonna run\nthis on our network, right?\n\n245\n00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:52.840\nPersonally identifiable information\nin your scan results, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.310\nOffCAT scans may contain information\nsome users may consider confidential.\n\n247\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:02.950\nSuch as email addresses, subject line\nof emails, meetings, or user names.\n\n248\n00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:07.110\nNote that it's not really saying it\ncould be payment card information.\n\n249\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.050\nBut the way that they\ntend to word it right,\n\n250\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.450\nsome users may be considering\nthis confidential.\n\n251\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.220\nEmail addresses, subject line of emails or\n\n252\n00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.640\nmeeting which I never knew was\nconfidential but I guess it could be.\n\n253\n00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.080\nAs well as usernames.\n\n254\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.880\nUsernames, maybe.\n\n255\n00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.410\nInformation is stored in a .offx scan,\n\n256\n00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.560\nwhich is gonna be located inside\nof APPDATA and OffCAT by default.\n\n257\n00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.280\nWe recommend you review the content of any\nof these before sharing them to others,\n\n258\n00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.850\nis what they're saying.\n\n259\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:43.710\nSo they're just making sure that you\nunderstand what can end up happening.\n\n260\n00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.960\nSo I'm simply gonna click Continue.\n\n261\n00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.030\nAnd not it's gonna run through, and\nit's now downloading the results.\n\n262\n00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:55.698\nAnd now it's giving me the programs that\nit can actually run through and scan.\n\n263\n00:15:55.698 --> 00:16:00.350\nSo if I Click on the down arrow.\n\n264\n00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.720\nNotice I have more programs and\n\n265\n00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.254\nthese are the ones that\nMicrosoft Office has installed.\n\n266\n00:16:04.254 --> 00:16:09.773\nExcel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Word, OneNote.\n\n267\n00:16:09.773 --> 00:16:13.623\nOneNote can be problematic sometimes,\nand Cherokee loves it but\n\n268\n00:16:13.623 --> 00:16:15.304\nI'm not such a big fan of it.\n\n269\n00:16:15.304 --> 00:16:19.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; OneDrive can also be problematic,\n\n270\n00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:26.240\nSkype, and especially these that really do\nrequire synchronization of information.\n\n271\n00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.450\nThose are usually pretty\nmuch the ones too, okay?\n\n272\n00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.610\nOutlook, if there's any program\nthat everybody's gonna always want\n\n273\n00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.190\ntroubleshooted if they're having issues\nit's gonna be something like Outlook.\n\n274\n00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.150\nAccess, Word, PowerPoint,\nnot so much so, but\n\n275\n00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.040\nif you do you just select\nthe one that you have here.\n\n276\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.320\nSo I'm going to pick,\nlet's say Outlook since I know\n\n277\n00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.010\nthat that one's actually running there,\nand scan it.\n\n278\n00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.165\nSo now as it's beginning its\nscan hopefully starting here.\n\n279\n00:16:55.165 --> 00:17:00.137\nI've just simply expanded it out so\nthat we can see that there it goes,\n\n280\n00:17:00.137 --> 00:17:02.851\nit's actually running 12, 14.\n\n281\n00:17:02.851 --> 00:17:07.029\nAnd you're seeing all these things\ncomplete as it goes through and\n\n282\n00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:10.395\nscans everything that it\nhas the availability to do.\n\n283\n00:17:10.395 --> 00:17:14.808\nGroup Policy Result,\nInstalled Office Updates,\n\n284\n00:17:14.808 --> 00:17:19.638\nuser details on logins,\nadd-in with known problems.\n\n285\n00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:23.300\nThis is something that that Office\nTelemetry tool could have actually helped\n\n286\n00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:23.929\nus out with.\n\n287\n00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:29.840\nAnd once we're done, you can now\nsee all the results here, right?\n\n288\n00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.840\nSo OffCAT results for Outlook, and\n\n289\n00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.710\nit even gives me the date that it\nwas run as well as the scan type.\n\n290\n00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.690\nYou can also see the ClickToRun,\nthe Offline version of it, the User name,\n\n291\n00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:51.080\nthe date itself, as well as if there's any\nconfiguration details and issues, right?\n\n292\n00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.240\nSo the great thing is I really don't\nhave anything wrong with Outlook.\n\n293\n00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.390\nBut if I did, this would probably be red,\n\n294\n00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.720\nI would assume,\nis the color that it would end up being.\n\n295\n00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.257\nAnd then all those issues\nwould be listed right here.\n\n296\n00:18:02.257 --> 00:18:06.360\nSo here's an example of\nthe informational warning.\n\n297\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.210\nAdminSecurityMode is not set.\n\n298\n00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.614\nIf I take a look at what that means,\nright,\n\n299\n00:18:10.614 --> 00:18:12.030\nlet me see if I can\nscroll over a little bit.\n\n300\n00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.360\nDefault Security, this option is\nthe default configuration in Outlook.\n\n301\n00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.530\nUsers can configure security themselves,\nand Outlook ignores any attachment or\n\n302\n00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:26.630\nprogrammatic access security\nsettings configured in Group Policy.\n\n303\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.920\nSo that's the default setting that we see.\n\n304\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.030\nOne of the big ones that most people\ndon't think about, of course,\n\n305\n00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.590\nmight be something like\nCached Credentials.\n\n306\n00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.170\nRemember that this is something\nthat could lead to some issues,\n\n307\n00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.210\nespecially when logging onto a machine and\nthis program itself.\n\n308\n00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.270\nAnd it does realize that I'm inside\nof a virtual machine, which is fine.\n\n309\n00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.800\nAlso of course Office\nis running on VMWare.\n\n310\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.090\nLet's see, anything else here, not really.\n\n311\n00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.790\nSo you can see where it gives you\nsome very detailed scans as you start\n\n312\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.970\nto do that in the report.\n\n313\n00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.601\nThere of course are different options\nwhere you can manage this to save it or\n\n314\n00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:07.551\nto actually open where\nit's actually stored.\n\n315\n00:19:07.551 --> 00:19:09.992\nYou can, of course,\nchange the way that things look.\n\n316\n00:19:09.992 --> 00:19:11.050\n&gt;&gt; Look at that rainbow colors.\n\n317\n00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.150\n&gt;&gt; Look at that, isn't that neat?\n\n318\n00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.660\nAnd advanced tools.\n\n319\n00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.120\nYou can do real time\nlogging if you chose to.\n\n320\n00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.270\nCalendar Checking, you name it,\nInventory Scan here.\n\n321\n00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.360\nRobust Inventory Scan collects Office\ndata, provides error detection and\n\n322\n00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.320\nanalysis options.\n\n323\n00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:34.789\nIt is a pretty detailed tool and\na very helpful tool if you're\n\n324\n00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:41.665\nreally into making sure that that type\nof scanning is happening and is done.\n\n325\n00:19:41.665 --> 00:19:45.566\nAnd this is one of the results that\nwe definitely want to make sure that\n\n326\n00:19:45.566 --> 00:19:46.519\nwe understand.\n\n327\n00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:51.037\nThat if we're having issues with it,\nyou can always come down and\n\n328\n00:19:51.037 --> 00:19:52.774\ncheck the logs, right?\n\n329\n00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:54.744\nYou can always do that for everybody, but\n\n330\n00:19:54.744 --> 00:19:58.385\njust kind of remember that here is kind\nof a very effective tool to help us.\n\n331\n00:19:58.385 --> 00:20:01.487\n&gt;&gt; But I can select multiple\ntools to run at the same time and\n\n332\n00:20:01.487 --> 00:20:03.095\nscan multiple programs?\n\n333\n00:20:03.095 --> 00:20:06.305\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it actually allows you to\nscan multiple programs at the same time,\n\n334\n00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:08.975\nwe can try,\nlet's see if that actually works here.\n\n335\n00:20:08.975 --> 00:20:10.935\nSo yes, look at that, there you go.\n\n336\n00:20:10.935 --> 00:20:12.615\nSo we wanna scan those two.\n\n337\n00:20:12.615 --> 00:20:14.515\nI wasn't sure cuz I've\nnever tried that before.\n\n338\n00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:17.480\nIf it's two tools I usually just\ntroubleshoot one at a time.\n\n339\n00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.294\nBut here we'll do what\nCherokee wants to do.\n\n340\n00:20:20.294 --> 00:20:21.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and scan multiple tools.\n\n341\n00:20:21.597 --> 00:20:23.350\n&gt;&gt; How thoughtful Ronnie, yeah.\n\n342\n00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, tools at the same time.\n\n343\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.610\nAnd if you do this, notice it's a little\nbit slower but at the same time it's still\n\n344\n00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:34.710\nokay, cuz this is not a bad machine,\nit's not a slow machine.\n\n345\n00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.430\nBut it is,\nPowerPoint scan completed very quickly.\n\n346\n00:20:40.547 --> 00:20:42.161\nNow, now it's preparing.\n\n347\n00:20:42.161 --> 00:20:46.412\nSo now there's four on PowerPoint.\n\n348\n00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:51.510\nAnd then let's see, there's the other\none which is, no it's the Word one, see?\n\n349\n00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.670\nThere we go.\n\n350\n00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.170\nView report.\n\n351\n00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.030\nAnd there it's preparing\nthe report which is here.\n\n352\n00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.114\nCash Credentials is the big one again.\n\n353\n00:21:01.114 --> 00:21:03.890\nAnd of course it actually always notices,\nit's like hey,\n\n354\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.011\nI know you're running\non a virtual machine.\n\n355\n00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:10.176\nI don't know why that matters so much, but\napparently it does matter in the world of\n\n356\n00:21:10.176 --> 00:21:13.630\nOffice whether it's running\non a virtual machine or not.\n\n357\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.860\nSo this is the way that you can get\nreally good and detailed information.\n\n358\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.082\nThat maybe the end-user cannot\nprovide in a way that can helpful for\n\n359\n00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:24.645\nwhat you actually need.\n\n360\n00:21:24.645 --> 00:21:27.384\nEspecially if it's those issues where it\nis crashing or something else is going on.\n\n361\n00:21:27.384 --> 00:21:30.545\n&gt;&gt; They're not able to articulate\nwhat they're experiencing.\n\n362\n00:21:30.545 --> 00:21:33.835\nYou really can bypass that by just\nlooking directly at the log files.\n\n363\n00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:37.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it is, it's a handy tool, it's\nsomething that we should be familiar with.\n\n364\n00:21:37.945 --> 00:21:42.172\nThe great thing is for you getting\nready for the exam, it's 100% free.\n\n365\n00:21:42.172 --> 00:21:45.272\nSo there's no excuse for\nyou not trying this out.\n\n366\n00:21:45.272 --> 00:21:46.897\n&gt;&gt; Look at that, Ronnie just told you.\n\n367\n00:21:46.897 --> 00:21:49.262\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's true, there's no doubt, okay.\n\n368\n00:21:49.262 --> 00:21:53.822\nSo just take a look,\nmake sure that you cover all these.\n\n369\n00:21:53.822 --> 00:21:56.612\nIn terms of planning\nit's an effective tool,\n\n370\n00:21:56.612 --> 00:22:00.070\nespecially if you know multiple\nusers are having the same thing.\n\n371\n00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:04.130\nRunning and collating that data may\nactually give you the actual pinpoint\n\n372\n00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.250\nof what could be going on, so\ndon't take it for granted.\n\n373\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.955\n&gt;&gt; All right, I won't.\n\n374\n00:22:07.955 --> 00:22:10.841\nWe have a tool at our disposal,\nthank you for showing us that, Ronnie.\n\n375\n00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:14.251\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\ntuning in, but we are out of time for\n\n376\n00:22:14.251 --> 00:22:15.820\nthis particular episode.\n\n377\n00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.320\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and sign out as your\nshow host, remember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n378\n00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:19.872\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n379\n00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:23.209\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n380\n00:22:23.209 --> 00:22:29.253\n[MUSIC]\n\n381\n00:22:29.253 --> 00:22:31.175\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.260\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Enabling Office\n365 Services series,\n\n6\n00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.240\nI'm you're show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.157\nIn the previous episode, we were setting\nup and configuring modern authentication,\n\n8\n00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:25.319\nbut there's still more work to be done.\n\n9\n00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:26.229\nSo in this show,\n\n10\n00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:31.320\nwe'll be taking a look specifically at how\nto implement multifactor authentication.\n\n11\n00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.240\nAnd with us to help us through\nthis process, we have Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.390\nRonnie Wong in studious.\n\n13\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.919\nThank you for joining us Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:37.910\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back.\n\n15\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.940\nAs we really do kind of\nshow the completion, or\n\n16\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.350\nthe idea behind, why we need to enable the\nidea of the modern authentication, right?\n\n17\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.190\nGetting that stuff set\nup is a big part of it.\n\n18\n00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.164\nMaking sure that we have Office\nready to go is a big part of it.\n\n19\n00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:56.755\nBut now, as we go, all right,\nnow that we know what is actually enabled,\n\n20\n00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.330\nhow do we get it to work?\n\n21\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.180\nAnd that's what we're hoping\nto show in this segment here\n\n22\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.260\nas we continue to move forward.\n\n23\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.020\nSo we're gonna use an example\nof multifactor authentication.\n\n24\n00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.421\nRemember that for us,\nmultifactor authentication means,\n\n25\n00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:14.966\nat least in most people's realm,\nthree different factors of authentication.\n\n26\n00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.210\n&gt;&gt; There's categories, yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.350\n&gt;&gt; So, one of course is what you-\n&gt;&gt; Something you have username or\n\n28\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.674\npassword\n&gt;&gt; Yup, and then something that you know.\n\n29\n00:01:24.674 --> 00:01:25.695\n&gt;&gt; Know.\n\n30\n00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:28.961\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen something that you do are yup, yeah.\n\n31\n00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:33.150\nSo when it comes to 2 out of the 3\nis multifactoral than occasions.\n\n32\n00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.210\nSo I'm gonna use a combination right now.\n\n33\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.570\nOf really, my phone as being one of\nthose factors, and then either password,\n\n34\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.750\npin number, something.\n\n35\n00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.248\nSome type of phrase to allow us to connect\nin and do what we need to do as well.\n\n36\n00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:49.493\nSo normally when we do something like\nthis, what should end up happening is if I\n\n37\n00:01:49.493 --> 00:01:52.786\ntry to authenticate, it might actually\nsay hey, Ronnie I'm gonna allow you to\n\n38\n00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:55.343\nauthenticate, but\nyou need to actually have your phone, and\n\n39\n00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:58.260\nI'm going to send you this\ncode that you need to type in.\n\n40\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.791\nSo it always has to be on you if you're\nactually doing something like this,\n\n41\n00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:04.269\nand this is becoming more and\nmore popular because-\n\n42\n00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:04.826\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n43\n00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:08.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, passwords,\nI hate to say it they're fairly venerable.\n\n44\n00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.780\nRegardless of how long they are any more,\nmachines are getting so powerful,\n\n45\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.510\nthe idea of being a run through,\nmillions of combinations is not\n\n46\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.060\nunheard of in a relatively short time\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n47\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.230\nnow we're actually starting\nto see more and more of this.\n\n48\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.842\nAnd Office 365 is ready to go.\n\n49\n00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:29.532\nSo once we've got it set up,\nand now enabled for\n\n50\n00:02:29.532 --> 00:02:32.690\nthe services that we want to\nactually be able to do this,\n\n51\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.170\nwhat we now need to do is go in and\nset up the administrative side of things.\n\n52\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.680\nSo let's go back to my machine, and\nthis is where we'll begin, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.150\nSo I'm logged in as\nthe Office Administrator itself, so\n\n54\n00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.017\nthis is a ten in administrator site,\nadministrator account and that's fine.\n\n55\n00:02:50.017 --> 00:02:53.283\nFrom this point I need to get\ninto the Office admin center,\n\n56\n00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:57.780\nthe easiest way I'm gonna do that\nis by clicking on the Admin tile.\n\n57\n00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.688\nAnd once I'm actually in the admin tile,\nthat will bring me, of course,\n\n58\n00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:07.617\nto the Office 365 Admin Center,\nwhich I want to actually be in, here.\n\n59\n00:03:07.617 --> 00:03:13.312\nNow, from this point, as I start setting\nsome of this up, I simply need to go ahead\n\n60\n00:03:13.312 --> 00:03:19.110\nand select Users right on the screen, and\nnow you can see here's the Active Users.\n\n61\n00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.066\nNow, Cherokee,\ndo you recognize any of these names here?\n\n62\n00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:26.269\n&gt;&gt; This theme has been ongoing for awhile\never since we started this show, and\n\n63\n00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.415\nthese are of course our 90s\nboy band members of NSync.\n\n64\n00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:31.360\n&gt;&gt; NSync,\nI thought it was the other group.\n\n65\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.454\n&gt;&gt; I could be totally wrong.\n\n66\n00:03:32.454 --> 00:03:36.317\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't have a clue, so\nthere you go so now here we are right.\n\n67\n00:03:36.317 --> 00:03:40.412\nSo you actually see our members there so\nso at this point what I need to do I'm\n\n68\n00:03:40.412 --> 00:03:44.061\njust gonna select let's do-\n&gt;&gt; No Justin Timberlake I see him he was\n\n69\n00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:45.680\ndefiantly in Nsync\n&gt;&gt; Was he?\n\n70\n00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.100\nShows you how much I know.\n\n71\n00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.901\nAll right so I'm simply going to select\nI think I'm gonna check yep lets go\n\n72\n00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:54.500\nahead and do that Well,\nmaybe I don't know.\n\n73\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.660\nLet me go ahead and select More.\n\n74\n00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.840\nCuz that's where I want to actually go.\n\n75\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.040\nIs once I get to this particular aspect,\nI'm gonna go up to More.\n\n76\n00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.830\nAnd now what I want is,\nwell, this link here.\n\n77\n00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.010\nNow, you can barely see it,\n\n78\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.290\nand that's because of the resolution\nthat I have on my screen.\n\n79\n00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.320\nBut it does actually end up saying here,\nif you do do this.\n\n80\n00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.280\nIt says, set up Azure multi-factor\noff is what it's saying.\n\n81\n00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.991\nWell, if I'm gonna set\na multifactor authentication, well,\n\n82\n00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:24.544\nlet me go ahead and\nselect that aspect of it.\n\n83\n00:04:24.544 --> 00:04:27.560\nAnd then in a moment here,\nit's gonna kind of change.\n\n84\n00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.822\nNow this is something that\nyou've gotta get used to.\n\n85\n00:04:29.822 --> 00:04:34.550\nI don't really like the way that Office\n365 does this, but people like this.\n\n86\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.618\nAnd every time I've clicked on a link, it\ndidn't actually just change the web page.\n\n87\n00:04:38.618 --> 00:04:43.346\nIt just added a new tab, so notice that\nevery time I'm doing this is adding a new\n\n88\n00:04:43.346 --> 00:04:48.234\ntab after while to me it's kinda a little\nbit annoying once I do some of it, okay.\n\n89\n00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:52.359\nNow it's saying hey,\nmulti-factor authentication service or\n\n90\n00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:56.784\nauthentication, users and\nservice setting only users licence to use\n\n91\n00:04:56.784 --> 00:05:00.140\nMicrosoft online services are able for\nthis.\n\n92\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.950\nSo that way you know exactly what to do\nif you need a little bit more information\n\n93\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.950\non getting this deployed for\nyour entire organization.\n\n94\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.145\nNotice you can also do this here,\ntoo, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:10.145 --> 00:05:12.080\nBut we're just gonna pick on one.\n\n96\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.322\nAnd I've been signed in as Joyce, so\nlet's select Lance's here for a moment.\n\n97\n00:05:18.322 --> 00:05:20.490\nAnd once we do that,\nlet me zoom out just a little bit.\n\n98\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.880\nYou can see here directly to\nthe right hand side where it says,\n\n99\n00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.870\nfor multi-factor authentication,\nlook at the status over here.\n\n100\n00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.531\nThis one's the one for Lance.\n\n101\n00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:32.476\nNow, I simply select enable.\n\n102\n00:05:34.924 --> 00:05:37.960\nAnd once I do that, and\nnow it says, hey, here it is.\n\n103\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.370\nRead the deployment guide,\nif you haven't already.\n\n104\n00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.400\nIf your users do not sign in\nregularly through the browser\n\n105\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.250\nyou can send them this link to register\nfor a multi-factor authentication.\n\n106\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.112\nSo, here is where they can actually go and\nset that up as well, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:54.112 --> 00:05:54.856\nSo, let me go and\n\n108\n00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:59.090\njust select this just in case I choose to\ndo this a little bit differently here.\n\n109\n00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.572\nSo, I'm going to select\nEnable multi-factor auth.\n\n110\n00:06:05.294 --> 00:06:08.790\nAnd now multi factor\nauthentication is enabled for\n\n111\n00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.130\nthis selected accounts\nthat we have ready to go.\n\n112\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.397\nClick Close, and\nnow we can see well is now enabled for\n\n113\n00:06:18.397 --> 00:06:25.349\nthat individual user right here off to\nthe site to be able to do that okay.\n\n114\n00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.035\nNow once that's actually done and we've\nselected the account that we want and\n\n115\n00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:33.301\nthat we've enabled,\nwe now need to go in and change and\n\n116\n00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:36.050\nselect the service settings, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.127\nWell, service settings\nare hidden a little bit.\n\n118\n00:06:39.127 --> 00:06:40.634\nI don't like the fact that-\n&gt;&gt; Kind of grayed out.\n\n119\n00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:41.237\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n120\n00:06:41.237 --> 00:06:41.839\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n121\n00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:45.393\n&gt;&gt; I hate to say that, it maybe a little\nbit difficult to see on the screen,\n\n122\n00:06:45.393 --> 00:06:48.270\nI'm trying to zoom in so\nthat you can see this.\n\n123\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.310\nUnless I use three different\ngradients of gray.\n\n124\n00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.660\nSo like, this is by far the darkest cuz\nwhen I select on to it it says bold but\n\n125\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.580\nnotice this is a little bit darker gray\nand then this is just plain out gray.\n\n126\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.340\nSo when you kind of zoom out, right-\n&gt;&gt; Just be aware of that.\n\n127\n00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.270\n&gt;&gt; It kind of almost fades\ninto the background so\n\n128\n00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.240\nyou're not exactly sure where to go.\n\n129\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.119\nBut the key here when you're getting ready\non exam, make sure you know you're going\n\n130\n00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:18.567\nto server settings to get to\nthe next part of this all right.\n\n131\n00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:24.374\nOnce you're inside of server settings,\nnow here it is, under app passwords,\n\n132\n00:07:24.374 --> 00:07:30.250\nallow users to create app passwords\nto sign into none browser apps, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.620\nSo, here's one that you can do right\nhere and then notice that there's\n\n134\n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.780\nalso of course the other one\nhere that is available to users.\n\n135\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.920\nCall the phone,\n\n136\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.810\ntext the phone, notification\nthrough mobile apps, look at that,\n\n137\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.810\nyou kind of realize that there's plenty\nof methods for you to use if you want to.\n\n138\n00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.160\n&gt;&gt; Something should work.\n\n139\n00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.287\n&gt;&gt; One of these should end up working.\n\n140\n00:07:52.287 --> 00:07:55.222\n&gt;&gt; So if they have a problem\nwith one of those situations.\n\n141\n00:07:55.222 --> 00:07:59.644\n&gt;&gt; So hopefully, I'm just gonna choose\nthe text to the phone at this point.\n\n142\n00:07:59.644 --> 00:08:00.420\n&gt;&gt; Pretty common.\n\n143\n00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.910\n&gt;&gt; It's fairly common, and\nit's fairly innocuous even if\n\n144\n00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.070\nsomebody were to get access to this,\nit may not know exactly what it goes to.\n\n145\n00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.273\nSo if they could log on there will be one\nthing but hopefully I've got lock on my\n\n146\n00:08:12.273 --> 00:08:14.706\nphone and that makes it much\nmore difficult for them to do.\n\n147\n00:08:14.706 --> 00:08:20.332\nAnd allow users to remember multi-factor\nauthentication on devices that they trust,\n\n148\n00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:23.307\ndays before a device must re-authenticate.\n\n149\n00:08:23.307 --> 00:08:27.364\nSo it tell you how often this device\nitself must be re-authenticated as well,\n\n150\n00:08:27.364 --> 00:08:31.482\nso just kinda remember that you have those\nsettings available if you choose to do\n\n151\n00:08:31.482 --> 00:08:34.230\nsomething like this,\nto get it all setup for us.\n\n152\n00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.270\nAll right, but the only one\nthat I'm really worried about,\n\n153\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.080\nof course, is right here.\n\n154\n00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.640\nAllow users to create app passwords and\nto sign on, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.546\nNow I just remembered something though,\nI think the one that is actually setup for\n\n156\n00:08:46.546 --> 00:08:47.693\nis actually Joey.\n\n157\n00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.795\nNot actually setup, but I think my phone\nnumber is actually setup for that.\n\n158\n00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:52.934\nSo I may have to go back and\nadd Joey's here instead.\n\n159\n00:08:52.934 --> 00:08:54.076\n&gt;&gt; Not too are we on Lance?\n\n160\n00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:54.679\n&gt;&gt; Not to Lance.\n\n161\n00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:57.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that may happen.\n\n162\n00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.740\nLet me go ahead and do that,\njust so that I'm consistent.\n\n163\n00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.813\nSo I'm gonna go back instead,\nat least I think I am, to users here, and\n\n164\n00:09:04.813 --> 00:09:10.877\nthis time I'm gonna select Joey, Fatone,\n\n165\n00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:15.030\nand simply enable him here as well.\n\n166\n00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.142\nAnd click that and\nthat should be good too all right?\n\n167\n00:09:21.142 --> 00:09:24.046\nNow once again service settings and\n\n168\n00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:29.280\nthis is not per user in terms\nof this multi factor settings.\n\n169\n00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.189\nThis will apply globally to the users that\nare in that list if we're doing this.\n\n170\n00:09:33.189 --> 00:09:37.323\nSo I wanna allow users to create\napp passwords to sign in to\n\n171\n00:09:37.323 --> 00:09:40.088\nnon-browser apps if they choose so.\n\n172\n00:09:40.088 --> 00:09:43.280\nAnd this point, we can select any of\nthese methods that are available.\n\n173\n00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.849\nI'm just gonna leave them all,\nand then just click Save here.\n\n174\n00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.245\nAnd now the update\noperation has been saved.\n\n175\n00:09:53.245 --> 00:09:57.407\nAnd once that's done it really isn't\nmuch that we have to do, right?\n\n176\n00:09:57.407 --> 00:10:02.246\nSo that really completes,\nat least the administrative side of things\n\n177\n00:10:02.246 --> 00:10:05.780\nthat we have to pay attention to for\nOffice 365.\n\n178\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.400\nNow, once we're done there,\nlet me go on over to Joey's computer.\n\n179\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.898\n&gt;&gt; The next step in this process,\nlogically then, for me,\n\n180\n00:10:13.898 --> 00:10:16.829\nwould be, we're gonna be looking\nat the client's side, right?\n\n181\n00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:17.929\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and that's what we have to do.\n\n182\n00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:19.191\n&gt;&gt; Is Joey squared away?\n\n183\n00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:20.920\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, we'll get Joey squared away.\n\n184\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.030\nWe'll see how that ends up working here.\n\n185\n00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:29.078\nAnd get everything set in,\nand ready to go.\n\n186\n00:10:29.078 --> 00:10:34.990\nNow, once we do this, let's go ahead and\nsee how we can get this in.\n\n187\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:41.020\nSo if I want to select this,\nonce the admin user is actually set up,\n\n188\n00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.250\nwe want to see if a user\ncan actually sign in.\n\n189\n00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.708\nSo, let's see, what are we gonna use here?\n\n190\n00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:49.288\nLet's see if I can just\nget on to the website.\n\n191\n00:10:49.288 --> 00:10:56.453\nAnd, Oops.\n\n192\n00:10:56.453 --> 00:11:00.513\nI think it was just happening and\nI just kind of messed it up here.\n\n193\n00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:09.940\nSo it doesn't look like it's\nactually taken place yet.\n\n194\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.595\nLet's see.\n&gt;&gt; Not requiring that\n\n195\n00:11:12.595 --> 00:11:13.910\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n196\n00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see.\n\n197\n00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.524\nI may have to, let me just close out\nthe entire browser just in case here.\n\n198\n00:11:23.356 --> 00:11:24.380\nI remember what I had to do.\n\n199\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.280\nI had to get that link.\n\n200\n00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.941\nI wonder if it actually\ngives me that link again.\n\n201\n00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:32.870\nGo back to,\nlet's see if I can find that link.\n\n202\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.020\nRemember there was a small link\nthat I had copied for Lance?\n\n203\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.978\n&gt;&gt; Was it the one you were complaining\nabout with all the extra time?\n\n204\n00:11:39.978 --> 00:11:41.574\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it was.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n205\n00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.264\n&gt;&gt; So let me see here,\n\n206\n00:11:44.264 --> 00:11:48.882\nmanager settings provide user\nto provide contact, delete.\n\n207\n00:11:48.882 --> 00:11:51.987\nLet's see, I don't see it here.\n\n208\n00:11:51.987 --> 00:11:55.580\nLet me see if I can enforce it.\n\n209\n00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.541\nAfter multi factor enforce users\nwill need to create an app, so\n\n210\n00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:02.315\nlet me enforce the authentication method.\n\n211\n00:12:02.315 --> 00:12:04.500\nSo for\nsome reason it wasn't actually enforced.\n\n212\n00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.372\nSo now we go back to service settings.\n\n213\n00:12:12.877 --> 00:12:16.290\nClick Save, and let's see.\n\n214\n00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.110\nAll right, so\nhopefully at this point it says\n\n215\n00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.560\nallow users to create app password\nto sign in to non-browser apps.\n\n216\n00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.927\nSo let's see if we can sign in to\na non-browser app at this point.\n\n217\n00:12:28.927 --> 00:12:32.123\n&gt;&gt; Right through the Outlook\non his computer.\n\n218\n00:12:32.123 --> 00:12:33.773\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's try that.\n\n219\n00:12:33.773 --> 00:12:34.594\nHopefully, I can get to it.\n\n220\n00:12:34.594 --> 00:12:35.855\n&gt;&gt; That local instance.\n\n221\n00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:37.440\n&gt;&gt; If I can actually find Outlook.\n\n222\n00:12:45.272 --> 00:12:48.982\nAnd in a moment it should ask me for\nauthentication, so\n\n223\n00:12:48.982 --> 00:12:51.120\nlet's see if it actually is.\n\n224\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.306\nIt doesn't look like\nit's actually doing it.\n\n225\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.111\nOops.\n&gt;&gt; We didn't like!\n\n226\n00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:04.544\n&gt;&gt; It just may be me typing in the wrong,\n\n227\n00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:14.263\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there you go,\n\n228\n00:13:14.263 --> 00:13:16.756\nfor added security now\nit's letting you know.\n\n229\n00:13:16.756 --> 00:13:19.670\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so if you haven't seen it,\nhere it is, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.155\nSo now that I've done this\nwith this particular computer,\n\n231\n00:13:22.155 --> 00:13:25.150\nit says your admin has required\nthat you set up this account.\n\n232\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.380\nFor additional security verification.\n\n233\n00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.764\nAll I have to do is select Set it up now.\n\n234\n00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:36.897\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Ronnie had some pie that he\ndidn't wanna share with the entire world\n\n235\n00:13:36.897 --> 00:13:38.277\nout there on the Internet.\n\n236\n00:13:38.277 --> 00:13:41.220\nSo we had to do a little bit of editing,\nbut we're back on track here.\n\n237\n00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.597\nAnd what's next, Ronnie?\n\n238\n00:13:42.597 --> 00:13:47.154\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, once we get all those codes sent\nin, so what ended up happening, right,\n\n239\n00:13:47.154 --> 00:13:50.487\nis that Office 365 sent a text\ncode back to my machine and\n\n240\n00:13:50.487 --> 00:13:52.820\nI simply type that in to the box at right.\n\n241\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.990\nSo I had it on my phone, I typed it in\nto the box and this is what ends up\n\n242\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.670\nhappening, which is what we're seeing\nright here on the screen in the next step.\n\n243\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.180\nSo we take a look at the computer,\nit will help us out here.\n\n244\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.970\nAdditional security verification,\nkeep using the existing application.\n\n245\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.190\nCreate an app password if we want to.\n\n246\n00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.330\nAnd the reason that's asking about that,\nit tells you that sometimes\n\n247\n00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.180\nsome particular applications, Outlook,\nApple Mail, Microsoft Office.\n\n248\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.254\nYou can't use a phone\nto secure your account.\n\n249\n00:14:22.254 --> 00:14:24.942\nSo it gives you another method\nif you wanted to, which\n\n250\n00:14:24.942 --> 00:14:29.020\nis to create this app password instead of\nactually using something like a phone.\n\n251\n00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.990\nBut since mine worked I'm\nsimply gonna click Done, and\n\n252\n00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.910\nnow I will be able to sign in and\nthere it is.\n\n253\n00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.124\nThere's all the e-mails and\ndifferent things for\n\n254\n00:14:40.124 --> 00:14:43.421\nJoey's account that has been set up and\nready to go.\n\n255\n00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:47.490\nSo we can actually get people to do\nthis if they're willing to right.\n\n256\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.871\nIt didn't really take much,\n\n257\n00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:51.756\nonce they actually created\ntheir own Office 365 account.\n\n258\n00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:54.930\nIf they chose to they could\nuse their own phone and\n\n259\n00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.440\nenter that into the account and\nthat's the way that would go.\n\n260\n00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.430\nNow what if your actually\nyour phone is actually issued\n\n261\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.830\nto you by the company well the company\ncould say you're gonna do this okay.\n\n262\n00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.590\nAnd that makes it easier but\nyou know someone elses personal phone\n\n263\n00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:16.140\nyou might not be able to say,\nhey, you've gotta do this.\n\n264\n00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.917\nYou might be able to say that, but\n\n265\n00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:21.483\na lot of times it's really up to\nthem what method that they choose.\n\n266\n00:15:21.483 --> 00:15:25.815\nBut normally providing at least one or two\ndifferent methods just like we saw with\n\n267\n00:15:25.815 --> 00:15:30.160\nverification through text or\nthrough a phone call or something.\n\n268\n00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.280\nIs kind of the key there,\nI simply choose to use my phone,\n\n269\n00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.508\ncuz normally I have that at all times\nanyways, so it doesn't seem to matter.\n\n270\n00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:41.751\nBut here you have a very simple basic to\nfactor authentication, if you try and\n\n271\n00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:45.731\nset this up and it's not working,\ngo back and verify if you've actually\n\n272\n00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:48.928\nentered in all of those connections\nthat OF is turned on and\n\n273\n00:15:48.928 --> 00:15:53.630\nthe ability to actually use the modern\nauthentication is on and ready to go.\n\n274\n00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.370\nIf it's not, that's probably\none of your big issues there.\n\n275\n00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.924\nUsually the other thing might end up being\nwhere it's really, they set up that app\n\n276\n00:16:00.924 --> 00:16:04.835\npassword, and typos are usually\nthe big consideration there, too.\n\n277\n00:16:04.835 --> 00:16:06.536\nBut besides that, there it is,\n\n278\n00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:10.830\nyou've seen now that not only that\nwe enable the services, ready to go.\n\n279\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:15.620\nBut now we've also set it up to where\nyou can say, the administrative\n\n280\n00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.350\nside is actually easy to set up, and\nthen the user side not too difficult, but\n\n281\n00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.630\nat the same time it does require\na little bit getting used to.\n\n282\n00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.945\nBut once they actually get it set up, it\ndoes provide a bit more security than just\n\n283\n00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:31.384\nhaving a simple email address and\npassword to get connected in.\n\n284\n00:16:31.384 --> 00:16:36.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're kind of underplaying\nthat Ronnie, a bit more security.\n\n285\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:36.950\nBut think about it.\n\n286\n00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.021\nI mean, we really are adding\nthat additional layer so\n\n287\n00:16:40.021 --> 00:16:44.130\nfrom that amount of work that you just\ncompleted that you guys just saw.\n\n288\n00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:48.320\nThink about having to basically you're\nmaking more work for the attacker.\n\n289\n00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.870\nAnd they're not just going to be able to\nutilize one particular program to perform\n\n290\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.070\na brute force attack or\nsomething like that.\n\n291\n00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.410\nSo, it's definitely worth looking into\nif you have the ability to go ahead and\n\n292\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.600\nset that up in your environment.\n\n293\n00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.110\n&gt;&gt; At least it's an early warning for\n\n294\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.280\nyou if somebody does try to hack\ninto your own, like Office.\n\n295\n00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.230\nIf I left my computer open and they were\nable to get access to my computer and\n\n296\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.600\nthey launched Office,\nit's asking them to authenticate,\n\n297\n00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.610\nwell if I have my phone on me,\nI know that somebody's trying to do it.\n\n298\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.710\nAnd if I'm not expecting it,\nthat may actually give me a red flag,\n\n299\n00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.360\nat least an early warning that something\nlike this is beginning to happen.\n\n300\n00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.934\nBut just kinda realize that that's\nreally the basics of the authentication.\n\n301\n00:17:27.934 --> 00:17:31.834\nSo either using that phone or\nusing the app password method, either one\n\n302\n00:17:31.834 --> 00:17:36.170\nwill end up working for you and probably\na great a way to actually do this.\n\n303\n00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.220\nSo, that is pretty much what I wanted\nto make sure that we completed and\n\n304\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.000\nthat we saw is not just only the setup,\nbut\n\n305\n00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.780\nactually the completion factor and\nhow this can be done.\n\n306\n00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.562\n&gt;&gt; We may be completed with this\nparticular topic and this demonstration,\n\n307\n00:17:48.562 --> 00:17:50.304\nbut that's not it for this show.\n\n308\n00:17:50.304 --> 00:17:51.730\nSo ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n309\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.350\nWe have more information headed your way\nBut for this show, we will sign out.\n\n310\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.064\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n311\n00:17:57.064 --> 00:17:57.940\n&gt;&gt;

your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.243\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at how to create a pilot group,\n\n7\n00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:24.909\na testing group to go ahead and\ndeploy your updates.\n\n8\n00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.412\nAnd with us today,\nback in studios, we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:31.475\nRonnie Wong, how is it going, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, Cherokee,\n\n10\n00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:34.624\nthank you for having me back\nas we continue to move forward\n\n11\n00:00:34.624 --> 00:00:38.147\nthrough the 70-347 series, as well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie,\n\n12\n00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:41.800\nthis is kind of an update to\nthis particular topic, right?\n\n13\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.368\nBecause we've talked about our\ndifferent groups before, but\n\n14\n00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:46.810\nyou've got some new info for us, right?\n&gt;&gt; We really do.\n\n15\n00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.560\nSo as we started to take a look at the\n70-347 series, as of June 30th of 2017.\n\n16\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.223\nWhich is just a few months previous\nto where we're recording now or\n\n17\n00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:00.231\nwhen we're recording now.\n\n18\n00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:02.661\nThey went ahead and decided,\nhey, let's just go ahead and\n\n19\n00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:03.980\nupdate that exam as well.\n\n20\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.789\nAnd they added in a whole\nnew domain objective, but\n\n21\n00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.788\nthey also went back and updated some\nof the original objectives as well.\n\n22\n00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:14.123\nSo we wanted to make sure that everybody\nhad the latest updates that we\n\n23\n00:01:14.123 --> 00:01:15.006\npossibly could.\n\n24\n00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:19.605\nAnd so we're reshooting, or we're actually\nadding in or updating, of course,\n\n25\n00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:20.616\nthose episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:20.616 --> 00:01:23.802\nAnd this particular topic is\none that needs to be updated,\n\n27\n00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:26.150\nbecause not only were there changes then.\n\n28\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.522\nBut there were even changes after that\npoint of June 30th that you need to know\n\n29\n00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:32.720\nabout that may also appear on the exam.\n\n30\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.345\nSo we wanted to make sure that you\nknow about that information as well.\n\n31\n00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:39.971\nAnd that includes, of course, this idea\nof actually creating this pilot group for\n\n32\n00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:42.763\nrunning things like updates,\nor Office 365.\n\n33\n00:01:42.763 --> 00:01:47.850\nAnd specifically the Office 2016\nProPlus edition of Office that we\n\n34\n00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.126\ngenerally download from our subscription.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so yeah,\n\n35\n00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:56.758\nwith this new, I guess, business\nmodel that Microsoft is embracing, or\n\n36\n00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:59.535\njust evolving on a pretty continual basis.\n\n37\n00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:03.457\nAnd there's not really any kind of\nscheduled release dates so far, so\n\n38\n00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:07.680\njust making sure we're toally up\nto date is what we're doing here.\n\n39\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.406\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so it really kind of,\n\n40\n00:02:09.406 --> 00:02:13.059\nat least that gives us a little bit\nof foundation that we need, right?\n\n41\n00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.103\nThe very fact is, for most of us,\n\n42\n00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:20.000\nin the way that we've actually thought\nabout the idea of updates for software.\n\n43\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.003\nAnd even for operating systems, and\n\n44\n00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:25.497\nadditional applications that we\nmay run on operating systems.\n\n45\n00:02:25.497 --> 00:02:29.580\nIt's been relatively easy to do updates.\n\n46\n00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.180\nAnd it's still relatively\neasy to do updates, but\n\n47\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.062\nit's no longer the traditional method\nthat you and I actually think about.\n\n48\n00:02:36.062 --> 00:02:39.126\nSo let's go back to the idea of\nthe example of using Office and\n\n49\n00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:41.110\nprevious editions of Office.\n\n50\n00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.987\nBut when we would download Office\nonto our own computers for work.\n\n51\n00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:48.540\nAnd then, of course, that would normally\nneed to be done one of two ways, right?\n\n52\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.572\nWe might include them into images that\nwe would then deploy out to our company\n\n53\n00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:53.146\nworkers.\n\n54\n00:02:53.146 --> 00:02:56.098\nAnd on that image, you would have not\nonly, of course, the latest updates for\n\n55\n00:02:56.098 --> 00:02:57.540\nyour operating system.\n\n56\n00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.956\nBut you might have even gone ahead and\nupdated the Office install as well, or\n\n57\n00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:02.928\nthat image too.\n\n58\n00:03:02.928 --> 00:03:06.148\nWell, that means, over time,\nwhat would also happen, of course,\n\n59\n00:03:06.148 --> 00:03:08.490\nis that as you allow that computer to run.\n\n60\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.100\nIt would connect, probably,\nif you were managing this,\n\n61\n00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.615\nto a WSUS server to get updates for both.\n\n62\n00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:18.190\nSo, in that sense, you would update\nthe operating system as well\n\n63\n00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.480\nas Office through using\nsomething like WSUS.\n\n64\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.969\nThe reality though,\nis that Office itself today,\n\n65\n00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:30.337\nespecially the Office ProPlus edition,\nis not going to update through WSUS.\n\n66\n00:03:30.337 --> 00:03:34.238\nSo you're not going to have that\navailable to you to be able to use, but\n\n67\n00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:38.260\nit doesn't mean that you can't\nmanage some sort of update here.\n\n68\n00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.109\nBut we do need to pay attention\nto the way that things are going.\n\n69\n00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.451\nIt's all about the idea of continual\nupdates is what they're providing, and\n\n70\n00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:47.610\ndifferent ways of updating as well.\n\n71\n00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.545\nAnd earlier in our series\nwe've talked about this, and\n\n72\n00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:53.679\nsome of the terminology that\nwe used there has now changed.\n\n73\n00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.180\nAnd we need to review that terminology,\n\n74\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.400\ntoo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of interesting to see,\n\n75\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.589\nnot only is the structure of the exams and\nthose objectives changing.\n\n76\n00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:06.745\nBut just also the way you can\nobtain those updates as well.\n\n77\n00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:11.386\nI mean we don't have necessarily, even\nwith our regular operating system updates,\n\n78\n00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:13.197\nlike a scheduled patch Tuesday.\n\n79\n00:04:13.197 --> 00:04:17.890\nYou see them happening kind of random and\nwhen on an as needed basis.\n\n80\n00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.694\nSo, when we're looking at our\napplication updates here in Office 365.\n\n81\n00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:26.355\nWhat are some essentials that we really\nneed to know or begin with here,\n\n82\n00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:28.928\nRonnie?\n&gt;&gt; Well, the easiest way, of course,\n\n83\n00:04:28.928 --> 00:04:30.248\nis to go to the source, right?\n\n84\n00:04:30.248 --> 00:04:31.838\nWhich is Microsoft's website,\n\n85\n00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:35.280\nthat gives us a little bit more\ninformation about these updates.\n\n86\n00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.797\nSo, let's take a look at my computer here,\n\n87\n00:04:37.797 --> 00:04:41.753\nand I'll go ahead and show you this\nparticular article that we have.\n\n88\n00:04:41.753 --> 00:04:46.635\nOverview of update channels for\nOffice 365 ProPlus.\n\n89\n00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:50.352\nSo this is the edition that you get your\nOffice 365 subscription up and running.\n\n90\n00:04:50.352 --> 00:04:52.802\nWhen you install it on your computers,\n\n91\n00:04:52.802 --> 00:04:57.505\nyou're going to be running what's\nnormally called the ProPlus edition.\n\n92\n00:04:57.505 --> 00:05:00.618\nNow back when we first started\nthis series, the updates and\n\n93\n00:05:00.618 --> 00:05:04.929\nthe way that they updated, they were\ncalled something considerably different.\n\n94\n00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:08.030\nAnd let me scroll down,\nif I can find my mouse, there we go.\n\n95\n00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.655\nLet me scroll down here, and\n\n96\n00:05:09.655 --> 00:05:13.869\nI want you to take a look at the blue box\nthat I have right here on the screen.\n\n97\n00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:20.256\nPrior to September 2017, these update\nchannels were named current channel,\n\n98\n00:05:20.256 --> 00:05:25.120\ndeferred channel, first release for\ndeferred channel.\n\n99\n00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.677\nNot exactly the easiest or\n\n100\n00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:30.508\nmost intuitive naming convention\nthat they ever came out with.\n\n101\n00:05:30.508 --> 00:05:32.884\nBut that's what they actually\nhave them call them,\n\n102\n00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:35.950\nwe did refer to this earlier\nin our series, doing that.\n\n103\n00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.836\nBut now with this update,\nwhat we're telling you is,\n\n104\n00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:38.663\nthat's changed.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n105\n00:05:38.663 --> 00:05:41.830\nI actually like the new names\nthat they've chosen here, Ronnie.\n\n106\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.418\nEspecially if you're an avid shopper and\nyou pay attention to those shopping\n\n107\n00:05:45.418 --> 00:05:47.858\nschedules, it might be easier for\nyou to remember.\n\n108\n00:05:47.858 --> 00:05:48.718\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n109\n00:05:48.718 --> 00:05:53.650\nthere's no doubt, so over on the kind\nof first third on the left-hand side.\n\n110\n00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.242\nYou'll see right up here at the top,\nwhere it says Update channel.\n\n111\n00:05:57.242 --> 00:06:01.950\nWell, they've changed those names to match\nwith what we call a Monthly Channel.\n\n112\n00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.970\nAnd then Semi-Annual Channel.\n\n113\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.598\nAnd then, of course,\nthey really didn't diverge too far,\n\n114\n00:06:08.598 --> 00:06:11.255\nSemi-Annual Channel Targeted.\n\n115\n00:06:11.255 --> 00:06:15.338\nSo, Semi-Annual Channel Targeted.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:06:15.338 --> 00:06:16.589\n&gt;&gt; All of these kind of relate in this.\n\n117\n00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:17.178\n&gt;&gt; That's a mouthful.\n\n118\n00:06:17.178 --> 00:06:17.871\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is a mouthful.\n\n119\n00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:18.747\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you just think\n\n120\n00:06:18.747 --> 00:06:19.672\nabout the sales, right?\n\n121\n00:06:19.672 --> 00:06:21.606\nYou've got your semi-annual sales, so\n\n122\n00:06:21.606 --> 00:06:23.491\nwe also have our semi-annual channel.\n\n123\n00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:24.312\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n124\n00:06:24.312 --> 00:06:25.145\n&gt;&gt; You and I do shopping a lot\n\n125\n00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:26.421\ndifferently.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:28.603\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And what I would actually do,\n\n127\n00:06:28.603 --> 00:06:30.930\nbut overall though, it works for us,\n\n128\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.732\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n129\n00:06:31.732 --> 00:06:32.288\n&gt;&gt; So, the way\n\n130\n00:06:32.288 --> 00:06:33.910\nthat the Monthly Channel does it.\n\n131\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.091\nIt coincides with what was\nreferred to earlier in our series,\n\n132\n00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:38.999\nwhat we called the Current Channel.\n\n133\n00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:43.856\nThe Semi-Annual Channel that you're\nlooking at right here also refers to\n\n134\n00:06:43.856 --> 00:06:47.180\nthe first release,\nactually, I'm lying to you.\n\n135\n00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.815\nIt refers to the deferred channel\nthat used to be called that way.\n\n136\n00:06:51.815 --> 00:06:56.900\nAnd then the semi-annual channel\ntargeted refers to the first release or\n\n137\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.030\ndeferred channel.\n\n138\n00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.619\nI know, it's kind of like,\nare you joking me?\n\n139\n00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:03.134\nWhat does that actually mean?\n&gt;&gt; What are you saying, Ronnie?\n\n140\n00:07:03.134 --> 00:07:04.849\n&gt;&gt; What does it come down to?\n\n141\n00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.223\nWell, let's explain this, and the great\nthing is they have a nice table for\n\n142\n00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:10.020\nus when we start doing this.\n\n143\n00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.209\nSo when we start to take a look, like,\nwhat is actually installed for Office,\n\n144\n00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:17.137\nis what we want to actually\nknow right now as we do this.\n\n145\n00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:19.460\nWell, it depends on how you look at it.\n\n146\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.201\nSo I'm going to launch up Word here so\n\n147\n00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:23.852\nthat we can tell what channel\nis actually on by default.\n\n148\n00:07:23.852 --> 00:07:26.959\nAnd I haven't changed it as far as I know,\nbut before I do that,\n\n149\n00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:30.060\nlet me go ahead and\nzoom this screen in just a little bit.\n\n150\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.543\nI can't promise you how great this\nis in terms of the navigation.\n\n151\n00:07:35.543 --> 00:07:39.310\nBut this should work for us where, and\n\n152\n00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:45.215\ngive me a moment to do so here,\nlet me type in Word 2016.\n\n153\n00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:49.946\nAnd when I do this,\nI'm going to launch a blank document.\n\n154\n00:07:49.946 --> 00:07:54.330\nAnd from there,\nI'm simply going to click on File, and\n\n155\n00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.513\nthen go down to where it says, Account.\n\n156\n00:07:57.513 --> 00:08:02.199\nAnd what we're looking for\nis right down here towards the bottom,\n\n157\n00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.940\nas you can see this.\n\n158\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.700\nNotice where it actually says monthly\nchannel, and this one is on target.\n\n159\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.287\nSo I'm assuming that I what I did is,\n\n160\n00:08:10.287 --> 00:08:13.630\nI did change where this\nparticular one is done.\n\n161\n00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.527\nCuz usually by default, this is on that\nidea of the semi annual is what it's\n\n162\n00:08:18.527 --> 00:08:22.260\nnormally on, or\nmonthly is what you might also see.\n\n163\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.908\nBut mine's on this idea of the monthly\ntarget, so if you're ever not sure,\n\n164\n00:08:25.908 --> 00:08:27.050\nthis is what you can do.\n\n165\n00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.086\nIs you can open up each of these products,\nand\n\n166\n00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:33.540\nthat's what you'll actually end up seeing\nas what particular channel this one is on.\n\n167\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.750\nSo on this one on the monthly channel,\n\n168\n00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:40.910\nthis is actually something just kind of\na little bit more so that we can see that.\n\n169\n00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:44.890\nNow if I go back to the webpage now, and\nI start seeing this, you're going, hey, I\n\n170\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.880\ndon't see a monthly channel target, well,\nyou can actually select this as well.\n\n171\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.770\nThere used to be something a little\nbit older also called a fast ring or\n\n172\n00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.280\nan insider ring.\n\n173\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.907\nAnd I'm assuming that what I did at some\npoint is go ahead and I updated it and\n\n174\n00:08:57.907 --> 00:08:59.360\nI said put me on the fast ring.\n\n175\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.895\nWhich means go ahead and do kind of these\nupdates that may improve features but\n\n176\n00:09:03.895 --> 00:09:05.720\nit's not tested yet.\n\n177\n00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.490\nSo I went ahead and did that cuz we're\nprobably doing some Office shows with\n\n178\n00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.070\nVonne at some point here and wanted to\nsee what some of those features were.\n\n179\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.101\nBut that's what you end up seeing, is that\nif you ever need to see where that is,\n\n180\n00:09:16.101 --> 00:09:17.930\nthat's where you'll\nactually find that out.\n\n181\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.830\nSo in this idea of the monthly channel,\nlet's go ahead and take a look here and\n\n182\n00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.788\nunderstand.\n\n183\n00:09:22.788 --> 00:09:25.740\nIt provides the user with the newest\nfeatures of Office as soon as\n\n184\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.260\nthey're available.\n\n185\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.250\nNotice it doesn't mean that\nas soon as they're made,\n\n186\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.910\nthey're going to just pop out.\n\n187\n00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.720\nIt's gonna be the idea of a monthly basis.\n\n188\n00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.530\nSo at least every 30 days,\nthat's what you'll end up seeing.\n\n189\n00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.060\nSo on default here, they show Visio Pro.\n\n190\n00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.470\nThe Project Online Desktop, and\nthen Office 365 Business, which\n\n191\n00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:51.130\nis the version that comes with some of\nthe Office plan, such as Business Premium.\n\n192\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.145\nThat may be another reason why I'm\nalso on this monthly channel as well,\n\n193\n00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:59.530\nis that I may have an Office Premium\nsubscription that I didn't think about.\n\n194\n00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.920\nThe semi annual channel\n\n195\n00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.640\nsays only provides new features of\nOffice only a few times a year.\n\n196\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.642\nNow what they mean by that is exactly like\nit says, every six months in January and\n\n197\n00:10:10.642 --> 00:10:14.996\nJuly so you have a base in January,\nthen you'll get them also in July.\n\n198\n00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:19.630\nAnd that's normally just the regular\nOffice Pro Plus edition that you're also\n\n199\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.590\nrunning.\n\n200\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:25.810\nAnd then the idea of the semi-annual\ntargeted pilot users,\n\n201\n00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.620\napplication compatibility testers,\nopportunity to test the next semi annual\n\n202\n00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.740\nchannel is every six months, but\nit's off-set by two or three months here.\n\n203\n00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.560\nSo it doesn't seem like it,\nbut what they're saying is\n\n204\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.560\nthe March update actually precedes the\nJuly update by what, three months, right?\n\n205\n00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.990\nMay, June, no, two months,\nyeah, two or three months here.\n\n206\n00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.930\nAnd then of course September precedes\nJanuary by two or three months as well.\n\n207\n00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:56.620\nAnd that is that idea if you actually need\nthe targeting for something like testing.\n\n208\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.890\nAnd it's ironic since we're talking\nabout creating a pilot group for\n\n209\n00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:00.787\ntesting updates.\n\n210\n00:11:00.787 --> 00:11:05.843\nAnd if you want control over the install\nof Office or over updating Office for\n\n211\n00:11:05.843 --> 00:11:10.425\nyour business, this idea of semi annual or\neven using the targeted is\n\n212\n00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:14.960\nprobably going to be key for\nwhat you want to do in your business.\n\n213\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.850\nBecause you don't wanna just deploy\nall these updates out to every user,\n\n214\n00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.930\nespecially if they can cause issues or\nproblems that you may have on hand,\n\n215\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.778\nas well, okay?\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, if I'm just looking at\n\n216\n00:11:25.778 --> 00:11:29.866\nthis for the first time, and\nI'm trying to make sense of everything,\n\n217\n00:11:29.866 --> 00:11:33.956\ndo you have any suggestions about who\nI should be assigning these types\n\n218\n00:11:33.956 --> 00:11:37.699\nof deployments to based on their\nrole within the organization or\n\n219\n00:11:37.699 --> 00:11:42.297\nmy methodology that our company adopts?\n&gt;&gt; Well yes, okay, you wanna make sure\n\n220\n00:11:42.297 --> 00:11:46.042\nthat you do pay attention to what\nit is that you're trying to do.\n\n221\n00:11:46.042 --> 00:11:48.762\nIf it is just for testing or\nif it's just to see new features\n\n222\n00:11:48.762 --> 00:11:51.690\nupdates with what you actually\nhave available to you.\n\n223\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.960\nSo in that sense you do wanna\ngo through this document,\n\n224\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.900\nI know I'm not telling you to read and\nmemorize this document.\n\n225\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.560\nBut have a good understanding of why\nthey actually have something like\n\n226\n00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.690\nthat semi-annual targeted that will\nhelp you out here and do this.\n\n227\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.880\nNow, what Cherokee has also talked about,\nso let's take for\n\n228\n00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.470\nan example, that as you start to take\na look at that idea of the monthly, and\n\n229\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.830\nthat's actually in this\nblue square down here.\n\n230\n00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.830\nAnd then of course there is\nthe semi-annual targeted and\n\n231\n00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.050\nthen the semi-annual challenge there,\n\n232\n00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.240\nwho would we put into what\npredictor of groups that we need?\n\n233\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.740\nWell, we already talked about the monthly\nas being the latest features and\n\n234\n00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.610\nupdates that we have.\n\n235\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.280\nThose particular ends of who you want\nthat to go to are normally gonna be,\n\n236\n00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.805\nof course, well,\na representative group of your end users.\n\n237\n00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:38.680\nTraditionally in terms of a pilot group,\nyou're talking about 5%\n\n238\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.950\nof your subscribed users, and it's spread\nacross a spectrum of your users, right?\n\n239\n00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.020\nDon't just get everybody\nfrom one department, but\n\n240\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.040\ngo ahead and pick about 5% of them.\n\n241\n00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.322\nThis is what you wanna do.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n242\n00:12:49.322 --> 00:12:54.429\nwith your selection on your system that we\njust saw you being more of a beta tester,\n\n243\n00:12:54.429 --> 00:12:58.887\nwe kind of wanna be careful about who\nwe are selecting to be these users.\n\n244\n00:12:58.887 --> 00:13:02.737\nSo that they have the ability\nto articulate any\n\n245\n00:13:02.737 --> 00:13:07.277\nkind of issues that may arise,\nmaybe not the newbie for\n\n246\n00:13:07.277 --> 00:13:11.470\nworking with the system.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, usually when you start doing\n\n247\n00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.030\nthis, there's some other things\nthat you can think about.\n\n248\n00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.400\nIt's not gonna be someone that's\njust brand new and hired.\n\n249\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.838\nYou normally want them to have at least\nsix months in working with the product\n\n250\n00:13:19.838 --> 00:13:23.140\nthat you're actually putting\nthem into this group.\n\n251\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.490\nBut they don't have to be\nthe most experienced either.\n\n252\n00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:30.378\nWhat you want them to do, though, is to\nfeel forthright to report any issues or\n\n253\n00:13:30.378 --> 00:13:32.018\nproblems that they have.\n\n254\n00:13:32.018 --> 00:13:34.121\nOr that they've gotten a new feature, or\n\n255\n00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:37.240\nwhat it might be that\nmay be concerning you.\n\n256\n00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.386\nSo if you roll this out on a monthly\nbasis, this is something that's great\n\n257\n00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:43.810\nbecause that means that you can learn\nabout what other features are happening.\n\n258\n00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.116\nAnd you'll actually see\nthat as you do this,\n\n259\n00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:49.340\nthe way that this is going in\nterms of the update model, right?\n\n260\n00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.490\nIf you're on that monthly channel,\n\n261\n00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:57.180\nyou're really getting all of the updates\nup into that first semi-annual side.\n\n262\n00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.860\nSo before everything actually happens,\nbefore anything's actually rolled out to\n\n263\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.630\neverybody else on either the semi-annual\ntargeted or even the other one,\n\n264\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.960\nthe semi-annual,\nyou're already seeing those features.\n\n265\n00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.000\nSo then when it rolls around, let's say,\nto the natural or to the normal one,\n\n266\n00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.210\nwhich is not the idea of some target,\nwhich is just a semi-annual.\n\n267\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:15.710\nAt that point,\n\n268\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:19.730\nyou've already seen everything by\nthe time that's ready to roll out.\n\n269\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.970\nSo if you have a monthly group of users,\nyou're really getting the latest and\n\n270\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.480\ngreatest that you can.\n\n271\n00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.080\nIn terms of the semi-annual,\n\n272\n00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.120\nis this is if you are trying to\ncreate a targeted pilot group.\n\n273\n00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.080\nSo there's some reason you're\nactually wanting to do this.\n\n274\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.272\nIt might be, let's say for example, a\ndeployment issue of some sort, and you're\n\n275\n00:14:37.272 --> 00:14:42.040\nsaying hey, what happens if I deploy this\nand I also try and do this type of update?\n\n276\n00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.300\nYou're trying to figure out\nsome use case scenario,\n\n277\n00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.670\nyou're trying to make sure that you\nhave everything that you're doing here.\n\n278\n00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.331\nMaybe your third party apps need\nvalidation on what's gonna happen,\n\n279\n00:14:52.331 --> 00:14:55.700\nwhether or not end users\nare going to adopt this easily.\n\n280\n00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.470\nSomething like this may actually be the\nkey for what you are seeing there, okay?\n\n281\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.120\nSo this may include that\ntesting group that you want,\n\n282\n00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.970\npeople that are really good\nactually testing the software.\n\n283\n00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.818\nAnd of course, applications that you want\nrunning, app add-ins that you might have.\n\n284\n00:15:09.818 --> 00:15:13.600\nEnd users, all of these are also a part\nof that particular group as well.\n\n285\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.284\nAnd then of course,\nyou have the semi-annual channel,\n\n286\n00:15:15.284 --> 00:15:16.628\nwhich is pretty much everybody else, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:16.628 --> 00:15:21.790\nIt is your broad deployment of who\nyou want to receive everything.\n\n288\n00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.608\nNow even though you can possibly disable\nthese updates, more than likely,\n\n289\n00:15:25.608 --> 00:15:27.840\nyou're still gonna end up getting them.\n\n290\n00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.520\nSo at some point, you're going\nto end up getting them as well.\n\n291\n00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.661\nMicrosoft Office really doesn't want\nyou to actually have that one edition\n\n292\n00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:37.090\nof Office in your office.\n\n293\n00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.390\nI know it sounds weird.\n\n294\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.230\nWhere the guy says I don't want updates,\nI'm gonna turn all that stuff off.\n\n295\n00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.181\nIt's probably gonna end up\nhappening at some point here.\n\n296\n00:15:45.181 --> 00:15:47.933\nCuz the idea of turning off updates\nanymore, like in Windows 10, you can't.\n\n297\n00:15:47.933 --> 00:15:52.470\nYou might be able to disable it for\nawhile or not accept it.\n\n298\n00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.732\nBut usually the idea that pushes here,\nokay,\n\n299\n00:15:54.732 --> 00:15:58.340\nis to actually have less updates by\ndoing semi-annual types of updates.\n\n300\n00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.773\nBut if you do have a testing group\nusing the idea of the monthly, or\n\n301\n00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:04.940\nusing even the idea here\nof the semi-annual target.\n\n302\n00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.670\nThat releases a couple of months before,\nso\n\n303\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.620\nthat you can test it out before\nthe rollout to the general public.\n\n304\n00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.010\nThat's what we're normally seeing, too.\n\n305\n00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:17.570\nBut all of these are actually different\nmethodologies as far as the groups and\n\n306\n00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.380\nwho that are actually\ngoing to be in those.\n\n307\n00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.850\nThat we actually want to be able to do,\nespecially for the idea of testing.\n\n308\n00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.780\nBut in this particular article that you\nsee, they have nice descriptions on what\n\n309\n00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.950\neach of these are actually for, so\ndo take some time and look through that.\n\n310\n00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.980\nMake sure you learn the names and\nthe change differences,\n\n311\n00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.160\ncuz it maybe during the early\npart of this entire series.\n\n312\n00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.560\nI did refer to them only by the old names,\nbut\n\n313\n00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.620\nyou may see a combination of both for\nthe exam.\n\n314\n00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:48.800\nAnd that's something you want to make sure\nthat you do kind of take a look at and\n\n315\n00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.430\nverify that you are ready to go.\n\n316\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:56.140\nSo when it comes down to testing though,\nokay, we need to figure out something else\n\n317\n00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.890\ntoo if we're going to create\na pilot group for this testing.\n\n318\n00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.430\nA group is really just a group.\n\n319\n00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:04.210\nIt's who we want in it as\nchoosing those users that we want\n\n320\n00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.350\nis kind of the key just like\nwhat Cherokee was pointing out.\n\n321\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.840\nBut you also have to pick a methodology or\n\n322\n00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.670\ntesting updates that\nyou also want as well.\n\n323\n00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.970\nSo in that particular vein of thinking\nwhat you might want to think about,\n\n324\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.140\nremember that you have this ability,\nif you choose to, right.\n\n325\n00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.690\nIs that you can actually get Office\nContent Delivery Network updates for\n\n326\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.190\npatching, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:32.560\nSo you can go ahead and do that, and\nyou take a look at Microsoft website, and\n\n328\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.000\nyou'll figure out how to\nactually get all that set up.\n\n329\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.750\nIf you're just looking for things like\nsecurity patching and stuff like that.\n\n330\n00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:43.550\nYou can also, of course, end up doing\nwhat we call managed updates as well.\n\n331\n00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.120\nNow we started talking\nabout managed updates.\n\n332\n00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.110\nThis is where we go into,\ndo we wanna manage this, but allow for\n\n333\n00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.360\nautomatic updates?\n\n334\n00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.260\nOr do we wanna manually manage everything?\n\n335\n00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:59.600\nSo, there are really three different\nmethods even in that that we can talk.\n\n336\n00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.440\nIt doesn't seem natural.\n\n337\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.090\nWhen I say that mainly updated our\n\n338\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:09.260\nmanually managing things\nactually can also be automatic.\n\n339\n00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.970\nLet me kind of give you\nan idea of what we're talking.\n\n340\n00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.560\nSo, remember default when you install\nthe Office 2016 onto your computer?\n\n341\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.450\nYou're gonna get automatic updates.\n\n342\n00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.960\nWhatever channel it chooses,\nusually it's just a semi annual,\n\n343\n00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.500\nbut depending on your subscription and\neverything.\n\n344\n00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.690\nBut that's directly connecting\nto the Internet at that point.\n\n345\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.780\nAnd when you directly connect to\nthe Internet, all the client computers\n\n346\n00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.220\nare gonna install the actual updates that\nare available from the update channel and\n\n347\n00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.780\nthat's from Microsoft.\n&gt;&gt; Fromt he operating system plus\n\n348\n00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.710\nthe applications, right, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times, yes, okay?\n\n349\n00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.080\nAnd that's just due to the way that\nthe Window's updates are also set up\n\n350\n00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.560\nas well as the Office updates\nthat are set up for you.\n\n351\n00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.020\nSo those are gonna happen automatically,\ndepending on whether it's the semi annual,\n\n352\n00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.750\nwhether it's the targeted,\nmonthly, whatever it's gonna be.\n\n353\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.170\nIt's gonna be on that particular\npattern that you have available.\n\n354\n00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.390\nBut that's not something you setup,\n\n355\n00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.620\nthat's just automatic,\nthat's just the way it's going to be.\n\n356\n00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.960\nBut, let's say that you go look.\n\n357\n00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.270\nI need automatic updates,\n\n358\n00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:11.290\nI don't want users in my company\ndeciding If they're gonna update or not.\n\n359\n00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.160\nI want this to actually still\ndo an automatic update.\n\n360\n00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.830\nBut, I want to choose where\nthey're gonna update from, and\n\n361\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.110\nnot some Internet server\nthat I don't know exactly.\n\n362\n00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.760\nBut you have that chance\nto also do this as well.\n\n363\n00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:30.520\nAnd, the way that you do this, of course,\nis by downloading the updates yourself,\n\n364\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.670\nrun Microsoft Office.\n\n365\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.070\nAnd then you store them\ninside a centralized share.\n\n366\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.540\nAnd once you do that, you can then\ntake your computer that you want, and\n\n367\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.710\ntell them to update from\nthat shared source.\n\n368\n00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.760\nIt is possible for you to do that\nleaving the automatic update turned on.\n\n369\n00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.540\nNow, normally when you're doing it,\nyou're also doing it as part of\n\n370\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.000\ndoing the idea here of using group\npolicy to help you out as well.\n\n371\n00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.900\nOr you can manually\npush out those updates,\n\n372\n00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.890\ndepending on what you choose to do.\n\n373\n00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.590\nSo in that one, you have that choice and\n\n374\n00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.300\nwe'll talk about what you need to make\nsure that all that happens as well, okay?\n\n375\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.330\nAnd then of course,\n\n376\n00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.550\nthere's the manual process,\nwhich means you're gonna do everything.\n\n377\n00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.520\nNot only are you going to pull\ndown the updates from Microsoft,\n\n378\n00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.660\nnot only are you gonna make sure that\nyou create that security group or\n\n379\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.760\nthat pilot group that you want inside\nof your organization to do so.\n\n380\n00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.980\nBut it means you're also going to,\nonce you get that group together and\n\n381\n00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.080\nyou got the policy proliferated out\nin the way that you want to and\n\n382\n00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.770\nthat your machines in that\ngroup are accepting it.\n\n383\n00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:35.690\nYou are going to manually push that update\nout through group policy as well, and\n\n384\n00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.650\nusing scripts, and using some of\nthe other things that are available.\n\n385\n00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:42.520\nSo all of those are actually possible for\nwhat we have for\n\n386\n00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.180\nyou as you're ready to go.\n\n387\n00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.670\nNow once you have all that in mind and\nyou figure out what you want to do.\n\n388\n00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.550\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna see if not in this,\n\n389\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.470\ncuz I'm starting to look at the time,\nnot in this episode.\n\n390\n00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:58.050\nWe may end up doing a part two and\nmaking sure that this carries through.\n\n391\n00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.070\nSo, that you can see at least\nan example of what we're talking about\n\n392\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.540\nin these features here.\n\n393\n00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.990\nBut, once you get that\nplan of what you wanna do,\n\n394\n00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:09.490\nyou also need to think about\nthe idea here of a rollback.\n\n395\n00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.970\nIn other words,\nwhat happens when things don't go right.\n\n396\n00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:16.110\nYou have to plan something like that\nout for this pilot group as well.\n\n397\n00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.140\nIt could be where you actually\njust go ahead and go,\n\n398\n00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.960\nlook, what we're gonna do is\njust whatever is out of the box.\n\n399\n00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.440\nSo it might be that you just\nstart off with that instead.\n\n400\n00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.980\nSo it's just, it's up to you on\nwhat methodology you choose to\n\n401\n00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.040\ndo something like this as well.\n\n402\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.880\nNow, with that all in mind, right, and\n\n403\n00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.600\nwe start thinking about this, there is a\nlot of terminology for you to think about.\n\n404\n00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.610\nRemember that, in this series,\nyou're gonna see a combination of both.\n\n405\n00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.560\nAnd there's nothing we can do\nabout that because, at one time,\n\n406\n00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.950\nright before the updates happened,\nwe were using that.\n\n407\n00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:50.350\nAnd actually even months after the update\nhappened we were still using the old one.\n\n408\n00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.890\nAnd it's just recently,\nin the last three or\n\n409\n00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.770\nfour months, as we're recording as\nwhat we're doing now it changed.\n\n410\n00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.320\nNow this also means something for us too.\n\n411\n00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.240\nIt doesn't mean that the future's\nguaranteed that it's not going to change.\n\n412\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.860\nSo in maybe if you are watching\nthis let's say you go,\n\n413\n00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.460\nRonnie recorded that in January of 2018.\n\n414\n00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.630\nI'm watching it now in October of\n2018 that stuff no longer applies.\n\n415\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.760\nIt could be that it changed again.\n\n416\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.690\nSo in cloud services and stuff you're\nnever gonna get this idea of where\n\n417\n00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.480\neverything is gonna always remain\nthe name is gonna be the same here.\n\n418\n00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.860\nSo just expect the change to\nhappen as you start seeing it.\n\n419\n00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.830\nGetting a good firm grasp on\nwhat we've talked about now and\n\n420\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.950\neven in the past as we\ncontinue to move forward.\n\n421\n00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:37.320\nWhat we want to do is take this\nopportunity to break here and\n\n422\n00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.690\nthen we're going to take the opportunity\nto show you how we can actually manage\n\n423\n00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:46.020\nthis idea of creating this pilot group,\nas well as using group policy and\n\n424\n00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.180\nthe tool that we need to do to help\nus to manage the update process, too.\n\n425\n00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.590\nBut this is a great place for us to go\nahead and take that break, and then we'll\n\n426\n00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.140\nget into that lab setting that we want.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect Ronnie,\n\n427\n00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.830\nthank you for your time as usual.\n\n428\n00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.680\nAnd thank you for your time as well,\nbut you don't want to miss out\n\n429\n00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.500\nbecause like Ronnie said,\nhang around for that demonstration.\n\n430\n00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.200\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n431\n00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.550\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n432\n00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.275\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPROTV.\n\n433\n00:23:11.275 --> 00:23:18.961\n[MUSIC]\n\n434\n00:23:18.961 -->

00:00:08.455\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:12.250\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.980\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\n70-347 exam series show.\n\n6\n00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.940\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.090\nAnd this episode we'll continue taking\na look how to create a test group for\n\n8\n00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.520\nthose updates and with us today back\nin studios we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.600\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.540\n&gt;&gt; It's going well,\nthank you, again Cherokee for\n\n11\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.520\nhaving me back as we continue on\nthis updated series part here.\n\n12\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.100\nNow we've just finished talking about\nit a previous episode to this the part\n\n13\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.210\none that you're watching the part two.\n\n14\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.050\nWhere we have talked about the update\nchannels and the changes to those.\n\n15\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.170\nMake sure you pay attention to those,\nespecially when preparing for the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.110\nAs you are watching this later from\nthis date, more than likely you\n\n17\n00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.970\nare going to see those name changes and\nwe don't want you to be confused.\n\n18\n00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.800\nYou will probably see example of both.\n\n19\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.310\nYou will need to know the old\none as well as the new one.\n\n20\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.520\nWhich is some of the things we talk about.\n\n21\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.040\nWe've also, of course, talked about the\nidea of why they're actually important.\n\n22\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.230\nAnd that is because, well,\nreceiving updates is one thing.\n\n23\n00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.200\nBut you know that sometimes just\nthe way that they're done by default,\n\n24\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.880\nit can break things at times when\nyou're not expecting them to.\n\n25\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.550\nSo it's probably better, especially if\nyou manage more than your own computer.\n\n26\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.960\nYou may want to actually create the idea\nof some type of testing group or\n\n27\n00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.880\na pilot group as you start to\ndeploy Office or start to deploy\n\n28\n00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.800\nyour updating methodology that you\nwant throughout your entire office for\n\n29\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.080\nthe 2016 product that's gonna be installed\non individual end user computers.\n\n30\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.530\nSo it's important that\nwe have that ability.\n\n31\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.480\nSo in that ability then,\nwe want to take a brief bit of time, and\n\n32\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.540\nit's not the most complex thing\nthat you'll ever do in Office 365.\n\n33\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.410\nBut it is something that you\nwant to do which is create this\n\n34\n00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.370\nidea of a pilot group.\n\n35\n00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.120\nNow in that previous episode we\ndid talk about who is normally\n\n36\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.850\nincluded in this pilot group, as well as\nthe idea of why we would want to do so and\n\n37\n00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.510\nwho's normally included in that.\n\n38\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.670\nWell, make sure that you pay\nattention to those things, too.\n\n39\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.610\nNow, we want to also do\nthe live demonstration of\n\n40\n00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.430\nwhat do you when you actually figure\nout your methodology and you do that?\n\n41\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.340\n&gt;&gt; So you did mention a couple different\nways we could do that, either use the ODD\n\n42\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.060\ntool, or I guess that's a little redundant\nif not ODT, or group policy, right?\n\n43\n00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.130\nSo that's a little beast thing here is\nreally how to get those up and running?\n\n44\n00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.740\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah that's pretty much the idea\nof seeing the interaction between those.\n\n45\n00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.690\nAnd of course you know we talk about the\nother one briefly, which is the default.\n\n46\n00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.420\nYou just install Office and\n\n47\n00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.240\nwhatever it does she decides do is\ngoing to automatically do the updates.\n\n48\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.950\nSo what you want to do then is where\ndo I get this idea of the ODT,\n\n49\n00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.370\nwhich is the office deployment tool.\n\n50\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.740\nYou wanna make sure that you go out to the\nInternet and you get this tool downloaded.\n\n51\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.680\nNow the easiest way to do this, let's\ntake a look at my computer screen and\n\n52\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.100\nthat way we'll show.\n\n53\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.660\nI went ahead and I browsed to it\nalready so that we could find it.\n\n54\n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.840\nBut I wanna show you something before I do\nthat cuz I thought well lemme go ahead and\n\n55\n00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.390\ndo that so it's no big deal.\n\n56\n00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.280\nI'm just gonna type in ODT, which is\nOffice Deployment Tool for Office 2016.\n\n57\n00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.370\nYou'll see that there’s\nactually quite a few of them\n\n58\n00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.250\nthat are actually available to you.\n\n59\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.900\nYou always wanna go and download the\nlatest one that you can as you do this.\n\n60\n00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.770\nNow you may be saying why?\n\n61\n00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.650\nBecause if you download, let's say now and\nyou’re not actually putting this into plan\n\n62\n00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.930\nfor another three months,\nthey update this tool regularly.\n\n63\n00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.890\nSo the best practice, right?\n\n64\n00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.580\nIs to go out and\ndownload the new tool at JAP.\n\n65\n00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.670\nDon't get the one for\n2013 if you're running Office 2016.\n\n66\n00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.570\nMake sure you get the one for 2013.\n\n67\n00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.100\nBut make sure you understand that, right?\n\n68\n00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.320\nSo, that's the tool that you want.\n\n69\n00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.790\nAs you start to run something like this,\nokay?\n\n70\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.950\nSo, from that particular link here,\n\n71\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.710\nthat's the only thing I really wanted to\nmake sure that I showed you here, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.760\nSo, you can click on Download.\n\n73\n00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.500\nAnd then once you download this,\nit'll download, and\n\n74\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.900\nthen you'll run the installer.\n\n75\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.560\nAnd once the installer is done,\nyou'll end up seeing this.\n\n76\n00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.040\nLet me bring you to where I've already\ndone this to save us just a little bit of\n\n77\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.112\ntime and effort.\n\n78\n00:04:19.112 --> 00:04:22.550\nAnd its' not exactly the most\nimpressive thing that you'll see.\n\n79\n00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.620\nBut normally,\n\n80\n00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.450\nwhat you'll end up seeing is something\nthat we call the config file here.\n\n81\n00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.440\nLet me zoom back in.\n\n82\n00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.630\nI forgot that I moved out of our lab here.\n\n83\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.070\nBut let me zoom back in\nhere using my zoom feature.\n\n84\n00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat'll be nice to see that XML file.\n\n85\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.340\nBecause it might look like a bunch\nof just scrambled scripting there.\n\n86\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.890\nBut if you take a look at it and really\npay attention to the different settings\n\n87\n00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.490\nand configuration options,\nyou can really customize it from that.\n\n88\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's two files\nthat you're really looking at.\n\n89\n00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.710\nOne, of course,\n\n90\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.220\nis this one that says configuration.xml\nthat's created by default.\n\n91\n00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.130\nAnd the other one is setup.exe which,\nof course,\n\n92\n00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.490\nis the execution file that one needs.\n\n93\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.400\nIf I right click on that configuration,\nI can go to Edit.\n\n94\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.550\nAnd from here, oops,\nlet me see here what we can show you.\n\n95\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.740\nLet me change that\nformatting a little bit.\n\n96\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.490\nNow that I've zoomed in quite a bit,\n19 point font doesn't seem actually quite-\n\n97\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.280\n&gt;&gt; So small.\n\n98\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.218\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so small.\n\n99\n00:05:20.218 --> 00:05:23.710\n[LAUGH] Seems gigantic.\n\n100\n00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.710\nSo here at the top you have\na comment section that essentially\n\n101\n00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.310\nexplains what to do.\n\n102\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.550\nNow because they have to be used together,\nthe setup.exe and the configuration file,\n\n103\n00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.760\nyou may wonder, well how the heck\ndo I learn how to do this?\n\n104\n00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.900\nWell that's why they gave\nyou this configuration file.\n\n105\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.610\nTo actually act as a template that\nyou actually want to be able to do.\n\n106\n00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.260\nAnd you can see that they\ngive you more information.\n\n107\n00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.700\nSo inside the comments,\n\n108\n00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.710\nOffice 365 client configuration file\nsample to be used with ProPlus 2016 apps.\n\n109\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.290\nAnd it kind of tells you exactly\nwhat addition it is for.\n\n110\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.760\nIt says other configuration details.\n\n111\n00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.880\nMake sure you pay attention to this\nif you are going to customize.\n\n112\n00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.030\nNotice this one the aka.ms.ODT.\n\n113\n00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.030\nYou may find even more additional\nconfiguration information.\n\n114\n00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.430\nThat can be used for you as well, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.610\nAnd then you can even see\nthat there's one for 2013,\n\n116\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.000\nso just remember that you\ndo wanna get the right one.\n\n117\n00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.730\nThe real configuration\nbegins right down here,\n\n118\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.990\nwhere we start seeing the XML tagging.\n\n119\n00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.030\nYou can see where it says configuration.\n\n120\n00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.070\nAnd on this particular configuration\nover on left hand side,\n\n121\n00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.690\nyou can see where it says\nadd OfficeClientEdition.\n\n122\n00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.340\nNow this is key and critical that\nyou have to actually understand and\n\n123\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.260\nknow what version of Office Pro Plus\nthat you downloaded for your computers.\n\n124\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.540\nNow, there are two particular versions\nright you have the 32-bit and the 64-bit.\n\n125\n00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.780\nAnd there by always gets confused\nabout which one to download.\n\n126\n00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.010\nWell, if you're the administrator make\nsure you choose which one your clients or\n\n127\n00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.200\nyour end users are going to download for\nthem, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.360\nSo when they first sign in to\ntheir Office 365 description, and\n\n129\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.330\nthey go,\nhey do I get Office on the computer?\n\n130\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.000\nYou either tell them or\nyou show them which one to download.\n\n131\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.770\nOr if you're actually setting this up\nto deploy Office, you go ahead and\n\n132\n00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.330\nyou download the version that you want.\n\n133\n00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.330\nAnd then that way you go all right,\nhere's where you're gonna go to\n\n134\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.840\nmake sure that this is run the right\nway when you start doing this.\n\n135\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.930\nSo just kinda realize that\nthat's what ends up happening.\n\n136\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.310\nBut this one is gonna add the 32 bit\naddition, and that's something that if you\n\n137\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.580\ngo and download from your subscription,\nyou'll see us recommend it.\n\n138\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.810\nSo they'll tell you,\nwhich ones should I download?\n\n139\n00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.000\nSo even if you're running\na 64 bit computer, yes, okay?\n\n140\n00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.760\nNow they really say that there's no\nreal additional benefit to you running\n\n141\n00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.138\nthe 64 bit edition, and\nthey recommend you run 32 bit edition.\n\n142\n00:07:48.138 --> 00:07:52.242\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was pretty surprised that they\nweren't like, hey, 64's so much better.\n\n143\n00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:56.777\nBut here, it's more important\nfrom a uniform perspective.\n\n144\n00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:58.983\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Just making it easier on the admins so\n\n145\n00:07:58.983 --> 00:08:02.787\nthat you're not having to worry about\nWhich version are you gonna be running and\n\n146\n00:08:02.787 --> 00:08:03.710\ninstalling here?\n\n147\n00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit does make a difference, right?\n\n148\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.610\nNot so much the internal\nworkings of what you have in it,\n\n149\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.050\nbut the idea of troubleshooting or\nthe administration part.\n\n150\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.090\nYou don't want to actually wonder, like\nwas that a part of it, was it the 64-bit\n\n151\n00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.000\nis why it's not working, versus the 32-bit\nwhen you're starting to do that.\n\n152\n00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.270\nThat's just adding another layer of\ncomplexity that if you choose for\n\n153\n00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.850\nthem it just makes it easier when\nyou're doing something like this and\n\n154\n00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.275\nyou're starting to actually manage\nstuff for your updates too.\n\n155\n00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:33.957\nHere notice they also chose to channel for\nus which is monthly, and\n\n156\n00:08:33.957 --> 00:08:35.351\nyou can change that too.\n\n157\n00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:37.088\nAnd then whatever your product ID is,\n\n158\n00:08:37.088 --> 00:08:40.300\nall this stuff can be found\nout on Microsoft's website.\n\n159\n00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.770\nSo make sure you take a look,\nchoose your language and then the product.\n\n160\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.080\nNow this particular\nregular configuration one,\n\n161\n00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.610\nnotice they ask you to only\nselect one product ID.\n\n162\n00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.490\nYou can actually select as many\nproduct IDs as you want to.\n\n163\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.590\nGo and find out from them exactly\nwhat the language is supposed to be.\n\n164\n00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:03.141\nPut that particular one inside the quotes\nthere and just that's what I would do.\n\n165\n00:09:03.141 --> 00:09:06.193\nI'd copy this product ID here and\nI'd paste it all down and\n\n166\n00:09:06.193 --> 00:09:09.790\nthen I'd choose Word 2016 Pro edition or\nwhatever it is.\n\n167\n00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.460\nMake sure you find the proper language for\nthis and then once you do that you'll\n\n168\n00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.250\nactually be able to update or\nchoose the one that you want.\n\n169\n00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.990\nFrom that point, notice right here,\nupdates enabled true.\n\n170\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.640\nChannel monthly.\n\n171\n00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.490\nWell, if you want that, all you have\nto do is remove these comment marks and\n\n172\n00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.110\nyou can do that.\n\n173\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.730\nAs well as the end user acceptance and\n\n174\n00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.720\neven the auto activation value too,\nif you wanna activate everything.\n\n175\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.950\nSo, it's from here you can modify this and\n\n176\n00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.520\njust save it as a different name,\nas what you want to be able to do.\n\n177\n00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.790\nLet's take for an example that this\nis something that we want to do.\n\n178\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.290\nWell, what we would do it we would take\nthis then, we would modify it, and\n\n179\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.670\nthen we would rename it\njust with another XML file.\n\n180\n00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.495\nNow, I've already done that which\nis through the one that's called\n\n181\n00:09:58.495 --> 00:10:04.030\nThisDownload.cfg file,\nwhich is the one directly under it here.\n\n182\n00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.500\nNow I haven't modified it\nvery much if I show you.\n\n183\n00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.180\nRight click and go to Edit here.\n\n184\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.930\nYou can see that I've pretty much left it,\n\n185\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.750\nthe only thing that I changed\nthough is the source path.\n\n186\n00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:21.390\nSo what am I actually telling this to\ndo if I run this ODT right now, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.410\nIf I'm setting this up for\nme to manage where the actual\n\n188\n00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:30.320\nfiles are going to go, well,\nI'm choosing, instead, to say what?\n\n189\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.290\nI want people to update, but\n\n190\n00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.890\nI want them to update from where\nI want them to update instead.\n\n191\n00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.860\nSo this configuration file using\nthe ODT is going to say, go ahead and\n\n192\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.840\ndownload what it is, into this UNC path.\n\n193\n00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.690\nWhich is normally just a shared\nfolder network location folder\n\n194\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.710\nthat anybody can access from\nthe network as well, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.035\n&gt;&gt; So you do wanna make sure\nthey have access to that.\n\n196\n00:10:55.035 --> 00:10:55.920\n&gt;&gt; Have access to that.\n\n197\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.370\nYeah, make a shared folder.\n\n198\n00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.710\nGive them the permissions that they need.\n\n199\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.350\nNormally I just do full\ncontrol at that point.\n\n200\n00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.500\nBut you give them whatever\npermissions you need.\n\n201\n00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.340\nThe perfect edition of Office.\n\n202\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.880\nThe product ID that you want to install,\nand then from that point the language of\n\n203\n00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.280\ncourse is actually important and\nthen what product.\n\n204\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.140\nNow I only chose one product.\n\n205\n00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.600\nIf I wanna do the entire Office Suite,\n\n206\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.160\nyou actually do need to put\neverything down in there.\n\n207\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.730\nBut I chose one for the sake of time and\nwhat we want to do.\n\n208\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.683\nAnd once you have something like this,\nand you go, all right,\n\n209\n00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:25.926\nthat's what I want to do.\n\n210\n00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:29.443\nWell, then you simply save this file, and\n\n211\n00:11:29.443 --> 00:11:35.230\nit's from here you run it by\nusing the setup.exe from the ODT.\n\n212\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.990\nNow once you do that,\nlike I said, since it's installed\n\n213\n00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.840\nyou have to actually run it from\nthe command line to make it work.\n\n214\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.080\nAnd there's three important elements for\nus to make something like this work here.\n\n215\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.780\nSo let me go down and\nbring up the command line tool\n\n216\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:57.520\nthat will help us and\nI'm gonna run this as an administrator.\n\n217\n00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:03.330\nBut one of the things is I've\nswitched computers here.\n\n218\n00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:09.500\nI have to remember, [LAUGH]\nwhere everything is,\n\n219\n00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.120\nis pretty much the key and\nremember the proper syntax.\n\n220\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.750\nSo that's what I get for\nswitching to Linux,\n\n221\n00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.630\nI don't remember all the syntax anymore.\n\n222\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.817\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, if you were in PowerShell\nyou could use create alliases so\n\n223\n00:12:19.817 --> 00:12:22.365\nthat we could have like your\nlittle translation there.\n\n224\n00:12:22.365 --> 00:12:24.612\n&gt;&gt; I could yeah sure thing.\n\n225\n00:12:24.612 --> 00:12:28.175\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't do that though so here we go.\n\n226\n00:12:28.175 --> 00:12:30.080\nAll right, so what do I need here, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.460\nThere's three elements to running\nthis ODT with the setup, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:39.460\nFirst, of course, is the setup\ntool itself which is setup.exe.\n\n229\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.720\nThen you need to change the mode here,\n\n230\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.770\nnow what I mean by this is\nwhat you want this tool to do.\n\n231\n00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.920\nRight now because I'm actually in\nthe process of saying I'm wanna\n\n232\n00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.800\ncreate this but\nI want people to download from me.\n\n233\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.650\nI need to download from Microsoft\nthe actual Office product that I want,\n\n234\n00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:04.900\nso in here I type in download and\nthat sets the mode of the ODT tool.\n\n235\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.335\nNow there's others there's install and\nthere's some other things that you can do,\n\n236\n00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:11.450\nbut here's what you can do\nat least at this point.\n\n237\n00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.998\nThen I need to make sure that\nI point it to the actual\n\n238\n00:13:14.998 --> 00:13:18.978\nconfig that's it's going to use, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:18.978 --> 00:13:22.790\nSo I'm gonna leave the up there just for\na second because this is important,\n\n240\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.060\nespecially as you get ready for the exam.\n\n241\n00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.560\nIf you can think about the idea of some of\n\n242\n00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.730\nthe tricky things that can\nhappen on exams, right?\n\n243\n00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.620\nThat they ask you,\nthey might be saying hey,\n\n244\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.600\nwhich of the following is\nthe proper ODT statement, right?\n\n245\n00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.460\nWell, you might go, no,\njust setup.exe, that download config.\n\n246\n00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.570\nYeah, I remember that part.\n\n247\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:47.630\nBut remember, you have the tool itself,\nyou have to have the mode,\n\n248\n00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:53.300\nand then you have to have the XML\nconfig to make all this work, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.200\nIf you miss any of those,\nit's not gonna work and\n\n250\n00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.030\nthat'd be an improper answer on the exam.\n\n251\n00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.770\nI'm not telling you that's\nwhat's on the exam,\n\n252\n00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.980\nI'm just telling you\nthat it is a possibility.\n\n253\n00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.050\nSo make sure you know if you're taking\na look at which of the following\n\n254\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.190\nis gonna allow you to do something like\nthis, make sure you pay attention here.\n\n255\n00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.530\nSo once I press Enter here,\n\n256\n00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.650\nwe are gonna leave that running because it\nis gonna go out and try and download that\n\n257\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.560\nand do that in the background,\nwhich I did set up that shared folder.\n\n258\n00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.960\nSo I wanna make sure I did all that,\nbut I did set up that shared folder.\n\n259\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.220\nSo in the end it should actually\nstart appearing there now.\n\n260\n00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.310\nI don't know how much\ntime it's gonna take, but\n\n261\n00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.270\nif I go to the Office 365 Updates.\n\n262\n00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.280\nYou'll see it starting to\nactually download here,\n\n263\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.370\nis what we're starting to see as well,\nokay?\n\n264\n00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.280\nSo that's a part of it, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.770\nSo that's just using the ODT to get things\nstarted as I do something like this.\n\n266\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.360\nNow the idea of creating the group.\n\n267\n00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.030\nThis is where you have to go into,\nof course, your computers and users and\n\n268\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.890\nyou can create a group from\nthere if you want to, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.870\nOr you can also, of course,\ncreate a group policy and\n\n270\n00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:04.290\nthen have the group apply there too and\nthat's what we want to do as well.\n\n271\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.705\nSo the best use of this,\n\n272\n00:15:05.705 --> 00:15:09.840\nright, it is a combination with group\npolicy if you have this available.\n\n273\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.920\nSo you have to use this to download\nto where we want to go and\n\n274\n00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.950\nthen from that point,\nI am on the domain controller.\n\n275\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:24.890\nAnd then, I'm gonna bring up the group\npolicy management console here.\n\n276\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:25.940\nAt least, I think I am.\n\n277\n00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.510\nI did click on it and there it is.\n\n278\n00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.840\nJust blinking in the background.\n\n279\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.300\nSo when you actually want to this,\n\n280\n00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.388\nthere's a couple of things that you\nalso have to know and do here too, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:38.388 --> 00:15:43.941\nOne is cuz we're actually creating\nthe idea of an update policy inside of\n\n282\n00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:50.056\ngroup policy, it means you have to have\nthe administrative templates to do so.\n\n283\n00:15:50.056 --> 00:15:52.715\nNow, if you don't have those\nadministrative templates,\n\n284\n00:15:52.715 --> 00:15:54.215\nit's not gonna help you, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:54.215 --> 00:15:56.501\nSo, how do I find out if I\nhave administrative templates?\n\n286\n00:15:56.501 --> 00:15:58.205\nYou can do it in a couple of ways here.\n\n287\n00:15:58.205 --> 00:15:59.948\nBut what I'm gonna do is,\n\n288\n00:15:59.948 --> 00:16:04.709\nI'm just gonna right-click on\nthe officeprodemoco.com node here,\n\n289\n00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:09.820\ncreate a GPO and link it here, and\nI'll just call this one test1 right now.\n\n290\n00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:14.030\nNow this is just me trying to show you\nwhere you can find out if you have it.\n\n291\n00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.280\nOnce I get that test1 created,\n\n292\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.890\nthen I can select test1, says hey are you\nsure you want, yes I'm sure, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:28.090\nI'm gonna right click and\nEdit that policy,\n\n294\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:35.070\nthen I'm gonna expand out under Computer\nConfiguration&gt; Administrative Templates,\n\n295\n00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.900\nand what you're looking for\nis right up here, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.950\nNotice I have Microsoft Office 2016 and\nfor\n\n297\n00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:47.260\nsome reason, PowerPoint 2016 also got\ndownloaded separately here as well.\n\n298\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.760\nIf you go and try and\nsee this in administrative templates, and\n\n299\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.650\nall you see there is\nactually all settings, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.020\nAnd you don't see anything else there for\nright now, more than likely means\n\n301\n00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.940\nyou don't have those Office\n2016 administrative templates.\n\n302\n00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.950\nSo how the heck do you get those\nOffice 2016 administrative templates?\n\n303\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.434\nWell, just like everything\nelse you go online and\n\n304\n00:17:10.434 --> 00:17:15.669\nthen you can download\nthe Office 2016 administrative\n\n305\n00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:19.859\ntemplates for Office customization, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:24.052\nAnd so this is actually something that you\nwant to make sure that you have available\n\n307\n00:17:24.052 --> 00:17:25.586\nas you download this, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.470\nNow, this is the one that's\na little bit trickier.\n\n309\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.710\nIf I select this download option,\n\n310\n00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.560\nwhich I've already downloaded, notice it\nactually gives me those two different.\n\n311\n00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.890\nLet me see if I can increase the font\nsize here so that you can see them.\n\n312\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.050\nThat's already at 150%, but\nobviously not big enough.\n\n313\n00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.603\nAll right, there we go, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:44.603 --> 00:17:48.210\nSo notice that you get two\ndifferent editions here, right?\n\n315\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:53.774\nThe templates for x86 and\nthen the templates for x64.\n\n316\n00:17:53.774 --> 00:17:58.666\nSo well Cherokee I'm running Office\n&gt;&gt; 32-bit.\n\n317\n00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:01.552\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm running Office the 32-bit edition.\n\n318\n00:18:01.552 --> 00:18:04.592\nBut Windows tandom is 64-bit, so\n\n319\n00:18:04.592 --> 00:18:10.990\nwhich of these two would I choose to\nactually want to do is the key, right?\n\n320\n00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.520\nCuz that's where people get confused.\n\n321\n00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.765\nThey're like,\nI'm running a 64-bit Operating System but\n\n322\n00:18:16.765 --> 00:18:18.480\n32-bit edition of Office.\n\n323\n00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.370\nWell, what do I want to do here?\n\n324\n00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.540\nYou wanna run the one that\nactually matches with?\n\n325\n00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.830\n&gt;&gt; Your Operating System.\n\n326\n00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.348\n&gt;&gt; Nope, Office 2016.\n\n327\n00:18:25.348 --> 00:18:27.007\nThat's the one you want to run.\n\n328\n00:18:27.007 --> 00:18:32.637\n&gt;&gt; So we're downloading our template for\nthe server which hopefully is 64-bit.\n\n329\n00:18:32.637 --> 00:18:37.148\nBut we wanna make sure that our\ntemplate coincides with the version of\n\n330\n00:18:37.148 --> 00:18:38.871\nthe application, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:38.871 --> 00:18:41.200\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yes.\nSo that's why it's confusing, yeah.\n\n332\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.440\nCuz it is a little bit more confusing\nhere than you want it to be.\n\n333\n00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.760\nBut if you're running 32-bit Office,\n\n334\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.570\nyou wanna make sure you get the 32-bit\nedition of these templates, okay?\n\n335\n00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.920\nIt's just a regular download, and once\nyou finish downloading that, let me see,\n\n336\n00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.160\nI should now be able to close or\nminimize at least.\n\n337\n00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.690\nHere, let me bring up Explorer again.\n\n338\n00:19:04.368 --> 00:19:09.398\nAnd inside of the Downloads folder,\nthat one that\n\n339\n00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:15.510\ndownloading to, there it is,\nAdmin x86 templates.\n\n340\n00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.540\nYou just double click on it, and\nit creates these two folders here.\n\n341\n00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:23.340\nThe aid and the admin folder and,\nof course, the admx files.\n\n342\n00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.479\nIf I select that, mine is emptiest,\n\n343\n00:19:25.479 --> 00:19:29.620\nbecause I moved it into the location\nthat I need inside a sysval, okay?\n\n344\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:33.440\nTo ensure that those templates are gonna\nbe recognized by the group policy\n\n345\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.840\nmanagement here.\n\n346\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.390\nBut it's normally a whole string of files.\n\n347\n00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.970\nThe important thing is to get all\nthose things that end in .admx,\n\n348\n00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.200\nif I'm saying that right.\n\n349\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.100\nAnd of course the language folder that you\nhave up there, for your language, okay?\n\n350\n00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.910\nAll the rest,\nthe ones that are of different languages,\n\n351\n00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.840\nit doesn't really matter\nif you get those or not,\n\n352\n00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.240\nunless you're supporting\nthose languages too.\n\n353\n00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:58.960\nSo once you do that, then you need\nto copy them to your sysval folder.\n\n354\n00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.410\nAnd the way I get to that is I do\na uncpath right here, officeprodemoco and\n\n355\n00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:09.490\nyou see where I'm already typed in there\nwhich is backslash and then sysval.\n\n356\n00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:14.440\nFrom there once I do that I can\nalso go back to officeprodemoco,\n\n357\n00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.140\nyou can notice that path right there.\n\n358\n00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.900\nSo like policies and then for\nyou to create a central store,\n\n359\n00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.110\nyou're gonna create a blank\nfolder called Policy Definitions.\n\n360\n00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:30.970\nAnd inside of Policy Definitions, here's\nwhere I've actually installed all of those\n\n361\n00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:36.670\nADMX files along with my\nlanguage folder here too, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.748\nThis is a good idea, okay?\n\n363\n00:20:39.748 --> 00:20:43.059\nNow, the idea of creating that\ncentral store is something that you,\n\n364\n00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:46.197\nif you're not sure what the central\nstore is, make sure you go and\n\n365\n00:20:46.197 --> 00:20:49.790\ncheck out some of the server shows,\nand do that and verify it.\n\n366\n00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.400\nOr rather this is really good\nespecially if you have large\n\n367\n00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.870\ndomains it really does help you out here.\n\n368\n00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.851\nSo now that I've moved\nall of that in there,\n\n369\n00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:00.603\nthat's why they showed up here, okay?\n\n370\n00:21:00.603 --> 00:21:02.367\nSo that was a long way to\nget around my elbow but\n\n371\n00:21:02.367 --> 00:21:04.810\nthat's exactly what ends up happening,\nright?\n\n372\n00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:09.834\nSo its' in here then I can modify and\ncreate a policy for things like\n\n373\n00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:15.961\nlicensing settings, miscellaneous\nsecurity settings, and updates, okay?\n\n374\n00:21:15.961 --> 00:21:19.093\nAnd it's pretty much the key\nof what you actually want\n\n375\n00:21:19.093 --> 00:21:21.470\nfrom this particular point too, okay?\n\n376\n00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:27.587\nSo if we get all of that set up and\nthe way that we want to,okay?\n\n377\n00:21:27.587 --> 00:21:29.018\nWe already talked about this,\n\n378\n00:21:29.018 --> 00:21:32.209\nyou can just create a group inside\nof your active directory policy and\n\n379\n00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:36.490\ncall it, test user, or office test users,\nwhatever you want to actually create.\n\n380\n00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.610\nBut from that point, all you have\nto do then is create a policy.\n\n381\n00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.930\nAnd then, attach that policy to\n\n382\n00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:48.906\nsome container inside of Active Directory\nhere, right, to do this.\n\n383\n00:21:48.906 --> 00:21:53.250\nAnd so, mine is actually attached\nat the domain if I wanted to.\n\n384\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.850\nBut I can actually attach it to one of\nthose OUs or whatever it might be and\n\n385\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.090\nmake sure that everything is\ndone the way that we want to.\n\n386\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:04.220\nAnd that would only affect\nthose users instead.\n\n387\n00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.050\nSo that way, when the computer either\nreboots or when the user logs off and\n\n388\n00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.125\nlogs back on here.\n\n389\n00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:11.890\nThey'll be able to have\nthat policy apply and\n\n390\n00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.850\nwhatever update policy I want is the key.\n\n391\n00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:19.660\nSo, let me go ahead and let's delete this,\nas I don't really need it.\n\n392\n00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.261\nThen, if I do the same thing\nwhere I just imagine and\n\n393\n00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:30.050\nI'll just call this the-\n&gt;&gt; Pilot group?\n\n394\n00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:30.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pilot group.\n\n395\n00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.120\nOf course that wouldn't\nbe our entire domain.\n\n396\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.860\nBut let's say that you had marketing\ndown here or test group or\n\n397\n00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.740\nwhatever it might be.\n\n398\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.635\nThen you would just go into pilot\ngroup and do the same editing.\n\n399\n00:22:46.635 --> 00:22:49.980\nAnd there is a couple of\nthings you want to do if you\n\n400\n00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.620\ndecide that you are gonna\nmanage updates in this way.\n\n401\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.192\nOf course,\nyou're gonna go back to the computer, and\n\n402\n00:22:57.192 --> 00:22:59.300\nthen Administrative Templates.\n\n403\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:05.400\nFrom here, you want to go into Office 2016\nfor, well, all of the Office settings.\n\n404\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.290\nAnd in the Updates, okay, is right here,\n\n405\n00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.070\nif you are going to do\nsomething like this.\n\n406\n00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:15.650\nYou need to make sure that you\ndisable automatic updates.\n\n407\n00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.300\nI know that that sounds funny, but\nif you're manually controlling this,\n\n408\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.780\nyou're simply going to disable this.\n\n409\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.700\nSo I just double clicked on the Setting\nfor Enable Automatic Updates and\n\n410\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.050\nthis is where it gets a little bit\nconfusing in the language again, right?\n\n411\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:34.944\nSo remember the phrasing and group policy\nphrasing has always been weird, right?\n\n412\n00:23:34.944 --> 00:23:38.220\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like firewall you make sure you\n\n413\n00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.230\ndouble read that so you're not disabling\nsomething you really want to enable.\n\n414\n00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.823\n&gt;&gt; Right, so notice this one's\ncalled enable automatic updates.\n\n415\n00:23:45.823 --> 00:23:51.261\nWell, what does that mean if I\ndisable enabling automatic updates?\n\n416\n00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:51.832\n&gt;&gt; Preventing.\n\n417\n00:23:51.832 --> 00:23:54.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nhopefully it means preventing, okay?\n\n418\n00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.770\nBut there are sometimes where the negative\nare like Does that mean I just\n\n419\n00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.449\nturned it on?\n\n420\n00:23:58.449 --> 00:23:59.260\nOr does that mean I turned it off?\n\n421\n00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.779\n&gt;&gt; Why did they do that to us?\n\n422\n00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:01.920\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n423\n00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.310\nyou'll see that kind of unusual term here.\n\n424\n00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.360\nBut if you're ever not sure,\ntake a look at the help over here.\n\n425\n00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:12.070\nIt says if you disable this policy,\nOffice won't check for updates, okay?\n\n426\n00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.093\nSo that is a strong sign for us.\n\n427\n00:24:15.093 --> 00:24:19.370\nSo we wanna go ahead and\njust disable something like that.\n\n428\n00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.420\nAnd make sure that that's actually done.\n\n429\n00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.450\nAnd then, from this point you\ncan always just take a look at,\n\n430\n00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.750\nsuch as changing the update channel, okay?\n\n431\n00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.330\nIf you wanted to change that, you can.\n\n432\n00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.720\nBut the more important thing, of course,\nis if you're saying I'm gonna control\n\n433\n00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.590\nwhere those updates are gonna come from,\nwhich is gonna be Update Path.\n\n434\n00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.980\nSo it's from the update path\nwhere I have to enable this.\n\n435\n00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:50.893\nAnd then we would choose the UNC\npath of my folder which,\n\n436\n00:24:50.893 --> 00:24:54.876\nof course, I can't remember.\n\n437\n00:24:54.876 --> 00:24:56.443\nLet me see if I can\ntake a look at it here.\n\n438\n00:24:58.738 --> 00:25:00.159\nO365 updates.\n\n439\n00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:04.988\n[LAUGH] You'd think I would remember that,\nbut go figure.\n\n440\n00:25:04.988 --> 00:25:07.058\nO365 updates.\n\n441\n00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.832\nSo this way, once I actually enable that,\nand then have to push this up.\n\n442\n00:25:18.527 --> 00:25:23.520\nAnd now I've changed those two settings\nfor whatever group that I wanted.\n\n443\n00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.680\nAnd I didn't actually change\nthe enable automatic updates.\n\n444\n00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.179\nWe need to disable that, and I forgot.\n\n445\n00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.060\nLet me make sure I click OK there.\n\n446\n00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:38.255\nSo those are at least the two\nthat I need to think about, okay?\n\n447\n00:25:38.255 --> 00:25:40.560\nIf I'm gonna configure this.\n\n448\n00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.740\nSo in theory, right, if this group\npolicy then pushes out to my group,\n\n449\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:51.620\nmy IT test users or Office 365 test users,\nwhat it should do to their machines,\n\n450\n00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.800\nright, because I did it\non the computer settings,\n\n451\n00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.800\nis automatic updates are going to\nturn off, which is what I want.\n\n452\n00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.430\nSecondly, when I do push out updates,\nthey're gonna actually get the updates\n\n453\n00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.912\naccording to their update path through\nwhat I set up here instead of the regular\n\n454\n00:26:06.912 --> 00:26:11.370\nOffice365 path, which is normally\nout to the Internet instead.\n\n455\n00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.924\nNow, there's a lot of other\nthings that you can do.\n\n456\n00:26:13.924 --> 00:26:16.260\nWe're not gonna take all the time\nto go through all of these.\n\n457\n00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.066\nBut notice that if you wanna hide or\ndisable updates,\n\n458\n00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:22.697\nyou can do that, right here, okay?\n\n459\n00:26:22.697 --> 00:26:24.740\nYou can hide update notifications.\n\n460\n00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.410\nIf people go,\nI don't know why it's always.\n\n461\n00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.770\nI don't want them to\nactually even notice it.\n\n462\n00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.300\nYou can change all this\nstuff if you choose to.\n\n463\n00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.370\nThe other thing is the target version,\nokay?\n\n464\n00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:41.082\nAllows you to specify a version number\nthat you want to update Office to.\n\n465\n00:26:41.082 --> 00:26:44.275\nSo if you have a particular version\nnumber that you go I just wanna make sure\n\n466\n00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:48.430\nthat everyone's on the same one, well, you\ncan push it out this way as well, okay?\n\n467\n00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:53.030\nSo using that all together is how\nyou go ahead and you do that.\n\n468\n00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:56.700\nYou create your group, pushing it out or\nmaking sure it's controlled through\n\n469\n00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.044\nthe group policy using the ODT is\nalso a big part of it as well.\n\n470\n00:27:01.044 --> 00:27:04.796\nAnd then, in the end,\nif everything ended up working here,\n\n471\n00:27:04.796 --> 00:27:07.160\nlet's see if it actually did finish.\n\n472\n00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.165\nSo yeah, so it doesn't really\nsay finished downloading,\n\n473\n00:27:10.165 --> 00:27:12.278\nit just kinda brings you to the next line.\n\n474\n00:27:12.278 --> 00:27:13.100\nBut you can check.\n\n475\n00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.400\nI should have showed you\nthis before I started, but\n\n476\n00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.790\nthis folder wasn't there before I started.\n\n477\n00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.730\nAnd then it should be in Data.\n\n478\n00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.228\nAnd inside that,\nyou can see this cab files and\n\n479\n00:27:23.228 --> 00:27:25.161\nalso this version file right here.\n\n480\n00:27:25.161 --> 00:27:28.583\nAnd you can even see the date which is,\nof course, the current date and\n\n481\n00:27:28.583 --> 00:27:31.930\ntime that we have where it was\ndownloaded right here as well, okay?\n\n482\n00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:35.630\nSo these are going to be some of the\nthings that you can do to make sure you\n\n483\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.640\ncan control everything that you need to.\n\n484\n00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.701\nSo in the idea of actually kind of\nthinking about everything that we've\n\n485\n00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:46.521\ntalked about, right, remember, if you're\ngonna run the ODT, three parts to it.\n\n486\n00:27:46.521 --> 00:27:50.310\nThat's gonna be essential, especially\nas you kinda get near that exam, right?\n\n487\n00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.426\nThe set up itself.\n\n488\n00:27:52.426 --> 00:27:56.334\nThe mode that you put it in,\nas well as the configuration file.\n\n489\n00:27:56.334 --> 00:27:57.730\nAlways key.\n\n490\n00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.700\nIf you are also going to be\ncontrolling the updates manually,\n\n491\n00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.050\ndoing it through group\npolicy is another key.\n\n492\n00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.740\nCreating that test pilot\ngroup that you want,\n\n493\n00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.900\ncall it marketing OU,\nwhatever it might be,\n\n494\n00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:12.970\nwherever you actually set that, you create\nthat and then attach that policy to that.\n\n495\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.370\nMake sure you push the policy out.\n\n496\n00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.630\nIt should redirect to where you have that.\n\n497\n00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:17.370\nThe shared folders,\n\n498\n00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.820\nthat centralized network location that\nyou're downloading all these things to.\n\n499\n00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.850\nYou can do other things if you want to.\n\n500\n00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.890\nYou can do a full install of Office from\nthat centralized location if you wanted\n\n501\n00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:28.790\nto as well.\n\n502\n00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.260\nBut just kinda realize that here is\nan example of what you might see when\n\n503\n00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.160\nyou start talking about managing\nthe updates a little bit more,\n\n504\n00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.360\nas well as creating this\nidea of the pilot group.\n\n505\n00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.640\nWhich is always good, especially if you\ndo need to test these settings out.\n\n506\n00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.940\nSo Cherokee, that's pretty much just about\neverything that we have here on the idea\n\n507\n00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.500\nof managing these updates and making sure\nthat we understand some of the changes\n\n508\n00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.100\nthat have actually been happening\nover the last several months.\n\n509\n00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:52.670\n&gt;&gt; Great, Ronnie.\n\n510\n00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.848\nThank you for spending the time\nto share that with us today.\n\n511\n00:28:55.848 --> 00:28:57.518\nOnce we go ahead and get this set up,\n\n512\n00:28:57.518 --> 00:29:01.656\nhopefully we are not configuring this very\noften, and your smooth sailing after that.\n\n513\n00:29:01.656 --> 00:29:05.297\nSo I know I appreciated the demonstration,\nbut let's go ahead and sign out for\n\n514\n00:29:05.297 --> 00:29:06.040\nthis show.\n\n515\n00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.030\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n516\n00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:08.914\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n517\n00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:10.932\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n518\n00:29:10.932 --> 00:29:17.896\n[MUSIC]\n\n519\n00:29:17.896 --> 00:29:20.937\n&gt;&gt; Thank you watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.273\n[MUSIC].\n\n4\n00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:12.108\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.108 --> 00:00:16.213\nWelcome to your enabling\nOffice365 services series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:17.994\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:22.480\nIn this episode we'll be looking at how\nto configure external SharePoint users.\n\n8\n00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.680\nWith us today in studios\nwe have Mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.490\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me here\nas we now continue into another service\n\n11\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.170\nthat we will find inside of Office 365.\n\n12\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.750\nWhich, of course,\nis connecting into SharePoint.\n\n13\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.850\nA lot of things that we end up doing\ninside of Office 365, the back end of it.\n\n14\n00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.500\nWhere we tend to store files,\nwhere we can share files,\n\n15\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.030\nwhere we can actually have everything.\n\n16\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.290\nIt all ties back around to this\nproduct that we all love and\n\n17\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.570\nthat at the same time really don't\nlove that we call SharePoint.\n\n18\n00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.890\nAnd so it allows us to be\nable to do all the thing that\n\n19\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.220\nOffice 365 wants us to go\ndo with collaboration.\n\n20\n00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.780\nAs well as the idea here of just\nbeing on the shared documents.\n\n21\n00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.010\nI just like you would any other product\nthat allows you to share documents where\n\n22\n00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.160\nthey are.\n\n23\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.750\nSo there's a lot that has to go on.\n\n24\n00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.810\nBut when start talking about\nthe idea of sharing information\n\n25\n00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.760\ninside of an organization\nwe pretty much have it\n\n26\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.570\nautomatically done\nthe majority of the time.\n\n27\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.250\nSo you just take a regular network\nwithout any Cloud services at all.\n\n28\n00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.150\nWe normally set up the centralize\nVAL share somewhere.\n\n29\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.410\nAnd that shares set or that centralized\nstorage device sits there and\n\n30\n00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.540\nall of us can end up with an account or\na folder that we all have.\n\n31\n00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.080\nAnd we essentially access it that way.\n\n32\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.730\nBut when it comes down to Office 365,\nwell one\n\n33\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.030\nof the things that we also have to worry\nabout is not only within our organization,\n\n34\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.220\ncuz that's done automatically\nwhich is kinda cool.\n\n35\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.240\nWe don't have to worry\nabout sharing anything out.\n\n36\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.480\nBut is the idea here of\ncourse of just talking about\n\n37\n00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.840\neverything else that needs to be done.\n\n38\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.160\nAnd that's what we're really\nfocusing on this particular episode.\n\n39\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.550\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, when we look at those\nexternal users who are we really be,\n\n40\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.590\nwhat's our target audience here or\ncustomers in this situation?\n\n41\n00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.540\n&gt;&gt; When we start to take a look at this,\n\n42\n00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.530\nmore than likely your company\nhas move to Office 365.\n\n43\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.880\nAnd then you started realizing something\nthat's as much as its neat to have a one,\n\n44\n00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.160\nwhat we call a one drive,\nyeah a one drive for business.\n\n45\n00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.010\nI was trying to make sure\nI was saying it right.\n\n46\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.520\nThat allows us to share\ndocuments internally.\n\n47\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.930\nWe start of course then communicating\nwith business partners.\n\n48\n00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.370\nAnd then we have to share files between or\ndocuments in between .And now,\n\n49\n00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.030\nyou start going, well,\nhow the heck do I do that fairly easily.\n\n50\n00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.840\nWell, if you have your own OneDrive\naccount, which it only comes\n\n51\n00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.730\nwith the Office365 subscription, when you\ndo that, you can share certain documents..\n\n52\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.550\nAnd it's designed to help us to\ndo that one document at a time.\n\n53\n00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.040\nIt's not really designed for being a full\nshare for something like collaboration.\n\n54\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.670\nBut then there's also OneDrive for\n\n55\n00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.820\nBusiness which is the backend of\nthat is really inside of SharePoint.\n\n56\n00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.470\nWhere what I can do is\nI can create something\n\n57\n00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.980\nthat then I can actually say here's how\nmuch access I want somebody to have.\n\n58\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.060\nHere's the other things that\nI want to be able to do.\n\n59\n00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.730\nBut when you start talking about\nexternal clients who are we really\n\n60\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.100\ntalking about then.\n\n61\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.720\nWell, a lot of times,\nit is those business partners.\n\n62\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.950\nWe could also think about someone\nthat's actually doing contract work for\n\n63\n00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.410\nus on the outside,\n\n64\n00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.470\nwhere they don't have a regular Office\n365 account with my organization.\n\n65\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.770\nBut they are actually somebody that\nwe've hired to do something for us too.\n\n66\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.910\nAnd it could be things like interns,\nif we wanted them to be.\n\n67\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.620\nYou name it,\nis somebody that doesn't have a regular\n\n68\n00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.520\nOffice 365 account within\nmy own organization.\n\n69\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.730\nAnd I still need them to be\nable to get access to files.\n\n70\n00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.330\nBut I don't wanna open it up like\na regular file sharer that's within\n\n71\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.410\nmy office.\n\n72\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.190\nI really wanna be able to restrict\naccess or give limited access.\n\n73\n00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.440\nOr even, if I wanted to,\nI could do unrestricted access.\n\n74\n00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.700\nBut we actually want more control and\n\n75\n00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.030\nthat's what we're talking\nabout trying to set up here.\n\n76\n00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.210\n&gt;&gt; So what kind of options do I have\nwhenever I am trying to share information\n\n77\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.780\nwith these external users.\n\n78\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.250\nIt seems like we have a couple\ndifferent ways to go about this.\n\n79\n00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.560\n&gt;&gt; There's really a couple\nof different ways.\n\n80\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.750\nBut the hard part about doing this inside\nof Office 365 If your initial for it.\n\n81\n00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.660\nIn other words, if you haven't\nworked with SharePoint before,\n\n82\n00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.050\nfinding where everything is,\neven through the web interface and\n\n83\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.880\nthe web administration center is\nnot the easiest thing in the world.\n\n84\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.810\nIt really requires us to have\nkind of this understanding here.\n\n85\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.230\nSharing has to take place\non two different levels.\n\n86\n00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.450\nOne global.\n\n87\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.690\nIn other words from the outside of our\norganization, someone else that has\n\n88\n00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.290\na different domain name attached to\ntheir own email something like that.\n\n89\n00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.810\nBut if they're gonna connect then they\nfirst have to be able to connect to my\n\n90\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.850\nbusiness and it makes sense right.\n\n91\n00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.280\nSo that means I have to be able to\nopen up sharing externally first.\n\n92\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.430\nBut then, I also have to go in and\nconfigure some sharing options for\n\n93\n00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.070\nwhat I really want them to access.\n\n94\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.360\nIn other words, the asset that\nI really want them to get to.\n\n95\n00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.020\nSo you have to be able\nto do it on both sides.\n\n96\n00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.820\nAnd for the way that we used to do\nit on just a regular file share.\n\n97\n00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.990\nAnd really wasn't that difficult.\n\n98\n00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.310\nYou just kind of said all right, here's\nwhere everybody's going to point to.\n\n99\n00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.930\nYou're gonna create a link on\nyour desktop and bam you're done.\n\n100\n00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.930\nAnd that's pretty much it.\n\n101\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.035\n&gt;&gt; Probably permissions would be a little\nbit, if we wanted to enable those.\n\n102\n00:05:25.035 --> 00:05:26.860\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you want to be able to do that.\n\n103\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.850\nThat was really about it.\n\n104\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.330\nBut now you have to.\n\n105\n00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.540\nSo if I'm going to be an admin for\nan Office 365 site.\n\n106\n00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.330\nAnd now I need to enable sharing.\n\n107\n00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.910\nI've gotta enable them both.\n\n108\n00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.560\nSo let's talk about this idea\nfirst in the global sense.\n\n109\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Remember that what we're really\n\n110\n00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.140\ntrying to do is saying,\nI'm gonna give access to people\n\n111\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.940\noutside of the organization\nto connect into my resources.\n\n112\n00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.270\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee some of those options and\n\n113\n00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.660\nthe availability that we have there or\nthe control that we have right there.\n\n114\n00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.460\nThat we need to be able to set.\n\n115\n00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.760\nSo let's go and\ntake a look then at my computer.\n\n116\n00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.742\nAnd when we do so, you'll see I'm logged\nin as the office administrator.Joy\n\n117\n00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:13.030\nfrom this point if I go now we're\ngonna create connections for external\n\n118\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.740\nusers to connect in the first thing is\nglobally is to be able to enable that.\n\n119\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.100\nSo the way that we do that, even though\nyou might go, all I have to do is look for\n\n120\n00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.700\nthe SharePoint icon right and\nyou can go there.\n\n121\n00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.880\nBut that only really allows you access\nin to seeing the SharePoint sites\n\n122\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.150\nthat may be available to you.\n\n123\n00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.950\nSo this is really more of Joey's\nview on how SharePoint works.\n\n124\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.520\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie when we look at\nthat particular SharePoint\n\n125\n00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.360\nicon we're getting Joey's perspective.\n\n126\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.110\nBut what if we wanted to\nsee a global perspective.\n\n127\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah if we're gonna be managing this,\nwe need to go into the admin center for\n\n128\n00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.420\nSharePoint is what we have to do.\n\n129\n00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.320\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look here and see.\n\n130\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.850\nSo as I come down I'll go ahead and\nselect on the admin center.\n\n131\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.760\nAnd when I click on that It's\ngonna open up another tab.\n\n132\n00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.020\nThis is one of the annoying things that\nit's just a personal thing with me.\n\n133\n00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.190\nI expect it to switch web pages.\n\n134\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.445\nBut every time you do this inside of the\nOffice admin Center or when you log in.\n\n135\n00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:13.685\nIt actually just opens up another tab and\n\n136\n00:07:13.685 --> 00:07:17.185\nwhen I select that, that of course\nactually brings us over here.\n\n137\n00:07:17.185 --> 00:07:19.405\n&gt;&gt; I can't say anything\nwith my thousand tabs.\n\n138\n00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:23.515\n&gt;&gt; Well again, the thousand tabs is\nnot bad as long as you can find it.\n\n139\n00:07:23.515 --> 00:07:25.905\nBut you end up seeing that there\nwill be four or five tabs up here.\n\n140\n00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:29.610\nAnd then you have to click through which\none and go, which one was I actually on.\n\n141\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.300\nNow once we're in here we're not exactly\nin the SharePoint Admin Center yet.\n\n142\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.920\nNotice I'm at the Admin Center.\n\n143\n00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.550\nSo over here on the left hand side\n\n144\n00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.840\nyours will probably have labels cuz your\nresolution's probably higher than mine.\n\n145\n00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.440\nMine's set at a relatively low resolution\nso that you can see everything better.\n\n146\n00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.134\nBut I'm gonna also come down here to the,\nwell,\n\n147\n00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:51.904\nlowest icon that I have on the left\nhand side on the navigation pane.\n\n148\n00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:54.380\nUnder Admin Centers, and when I do so,\n\n149\n00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.268\nI'm going to select SharePoint here And\nthere it is, there's my third tab.\n\n150\n00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:03.844\nAnd you can imagine now with two clicks\nI've already got three tabs opening up so\n\n151\n00:08:03.844 --> 00:08:07.320\nthis is gonna actually continue\nto build up like this.\n\n152\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.550\nAnd all of the sudden\nthere's not gonna be a lot so\n\n153\n00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.410\nI'm gonna reduce my address bar a little\nbit because I'm not gonna be working\n\n154\n00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.820\nwith the address bar itself so much.\n\n155\n00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.840\nSo this is where you end up seeing\nthe global perspective of SharePoint\n\n156\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.160\ninside of Office 365.\n\n157\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.660\nNotice that you see every single one\nof the sites that I can manage here.\n\n158\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.950\nAnd I've actually only created\na couple of different sites.\n\n159\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.990\nLet me go ahead and\nscroll in a little bit.\n\n160\n00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.870\nBy default right, here's the main\nSharePoint site that we have.\n\n161\n00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.640\nAnd then there's a couple of\nother ones that are also here.\n\n162\n00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.570\nSet up for some of the different aspects\nof what you can manage through SharePoint.\n\n163\n00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.510\nBut then I created this London one,\nand this New York City one.\n\n164\n00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.352\nWe're gonna be using those two for\nright now.\n\n165\n00:08:52.352 --> 00:08:55.165\nBut notice this one down\nhere where it says,\n\n166\n00:08:55.165 --> 00:08:58.320\nthe officeprodemoco-my.sharepoint.com.\n\n167\n00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:05.030\nThis is Joey's personal OneDrive or\nSharePoint site that he has for himself.\n\n168\n00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.060\nSo this one is designed for\nhim to be able to share things that\n\n169\n00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.390\nreally don't necessarily need to be\nshared with the entire organization, but\n\n170\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.950\nallows him to be able to get access to it.\n\n171\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.378\nAnd then he can share out\nthings that he wants to.\n\n172\n00:09:15.378 --> 00:09:19.630\nBut notice that these couple of different\nsites that we have available right here.\n\n173\n00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.640\nWell this is where we can go in and\nset a few things and limit.\n\n174\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.950\nBut we're not talking about\nany limitations yet, right?\n\n175\n00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.700\nSo over on the left hand side,\nthis is instead where we go and\n\n176\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.560\nenable the global configuration.\n\n177\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.621\nIn other words for the entire\norganization that I now want to allow for\n\n178\n00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:42.270\nexternal users to be able to connect and\nthen to share.\n\n179\n00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.500\nThe great thing is they really did try\nto make it a little bit more intuitive\n\n180\n00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.930\nby setting up, look.\n\n181\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.610\nIf I wanted to share, they actually show\nyou over here on the left hand side,\n\n182\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.830\nsharing.\n\n183\n00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:58.620\nAnd this particular option is all\nabout the idea of sharing but\n\n184\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.180\nwith external users.\n\n185\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.705\nOkay so\nwhen you actually set this up right?\n\n186\n00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:07.215\nBecause the sharing is done\nautomatically for internal users,\n\n187\n00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:10.270\nthose that have the same\nOffice 365 domain as I have.\n\n188\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.660\nBut now everything else here.\n\n189\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.450\nAnd if I wanted to actually do one\nsetting that would do everything\n\n190\n00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.990\nCherokee I don't know if you\ncan actually see this or not.\n\n191\n00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.630\nI think it is relatively simple.\n\n192\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.769\nIf I needed to share things with external\nuser, outside of my organization,\n\n193\n00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:25.698\nyou would think that.\n\n194\n00:10:25.698 --> 00:10:27.000\nIt is right here.\n\n195\n00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.940\nThis is where you would\nnormally go to do so, right?\n\n196\n00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.150\nWhere it says,\nsharing outside your organization.\n\n197\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.140\nControl how users share content with\npeople outside your organization.\n\n198\n00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.042\nThat's what I would have assumed.\n\n199\n00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:40.020\nYeah, and\nyou would think that- One would think.\n\n200\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.490\nThat's actually easy, but\n\n201\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.960\nat the same time, it's easy if you've done\nthis before, if you actually known it.\n\n202\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.594\nBut even getting it right, it was\na little bit more of a challenge, Sure.\n\n203\n00:10:48.594 --> 00:10:52.036\nThan you thought, you just simply\nlike I said you might think,\n\n204\n00:10:52.036 --> 00:10:56.320\nI'll just click on the SharePoint\nicon underneath the administrator.\n\n205\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.410\nAnd then from that point,\nI go to my Settings.\n\n206\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.610\nAnd if I do that,\nas only for that one site.\n\n207\n00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.350\nBut then if you're not the administrator,\nguess what?\n\n208\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.170\nYou don't get to actually do anything.\n\n209\n00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.070\nBut you need to enable global sharing.\n\n210\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:12.450\nYou have to make sure that you're actually\ninside the SharePoint admin center first,\n\n211\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.830\nand then select sharing over\nhere on the left hand side.\n\n212\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.710\nFrom that point, we're gonna actually\nspend a little bit of time here,\n\n213\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.290\ntalking about the options\nthat are available to us.\n\n214\n00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.660\nBecause these are important,\n\n215\n00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.310\nthat you understand what happens\nwhen you select these, okay.\n\n216\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.540\nNow, at the global level,\n\n217\n00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.360\nif we say that we're allowing\nusers to actually connect in.\n\n218\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.032\nWell that would be silly if\nI selected this one, okay?\n\n219\n00:11:37.032 --> 00:11:41.800\nAnd that says don't allow sharing\noutside your organization, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.740\nSo, if I'm saying I want external users to\nconnect in, this is going to prevent that.\n\n221\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.756\nRight?\nThat's the opposite of what\n\n222\n00:11:46.756 --> 00:11:47.540\nwe want to accomplish.\n\n223\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.570\nIt really is beyond the opposite here.\n\n224\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.890\nIt does something a little\nbit strange too, okay?\n\n225\n00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.780\nWhatever default setting is,\nlet's say somebody else has actually\n\n226\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.980\nset one of these other three options,\nlet's say allow, which makes sense.\n\n227\n00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.860\nIf we're gonna do this, if I go ahead and\n\n228\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.810\ndo this one, it means that all those\nother people that were shared,\n\n229\n00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.630\nat one point in time,\nexternal users that were connected in.\n\n230\n00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.580\nAre now prohibited?\n\n231\n00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.700\nThey are now actually prohibited.\n\n232\n00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.560\nThey will actually be\ndeleted as external users.\n\n233\n00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.428\nAnd so if you actually go, crud I made\na mistake and you hit Save after that.\n\n234\n00:12:19.428 --> 00:12:23.230\nThat means you have to go back and\nrecreate all of those connections again.\n\n235\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.610\nCouple people maybe not so bad.\n\n236\n00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.860\nA couple hundred, yikes.\n\n237\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.778\nYeah, now it becomes a little bit\nmore [LAUGH] [LAUGH] Challenging.\n\n238\n00:12:29.778 --> 00:12:30.852\nTroublesome, yeah.\n\n239\n00:12:30.852 --> 00:12:34.128\nChallenging to actually\nremember who did this.\n\n240\n00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:39.220\nSo you wanna be careful here if you're\ndoing SunYS, now if you go all right,\n\n241\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.410\nnow I've got to get everybody back in.\n\n242\n00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.310\nRemember that they'll have to be\nre-invited to come back in and\n\n243\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:47.900\nmake sure that sharing is actually going\nto be allowed when you do this, okay?\n\n244\n00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.100\nSo the second option\nthough is a little bit\n\n245\n00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.360\nless restrictive where it says allow\nsharing with external users only\n\n246\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.020\nthat already exists in your\norganization's directory.\n\n247\n00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.130\nOkay, now what in the world is that\n\n248\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.670\nabout when you start to\ntake a look at this option?\n\n249\n00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.370\nAllow sharing with external users that\nalready exist in your organization'\n\n250\n00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.880\ndirectory.\n\n251\n00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.610\nWell if there in,\nI'm thinking in my directory, like in\n\n252\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.970\nActive Directory they should be part\nof my domain so how are they external?\n\n253\n00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:18.820\nRight.\nRight?\n\n254\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.640\nYeah, but that's not what\nthey're really talking about.\n\n255\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.732\nIt's strange but it's true.\n\n256\n00:13:21.732 --> 00:13:25.170\nWhat they're saying is if you\nalready had external connections.\n\n257\n00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:30.080\nIn other words right now,\nif you have external connections and\n\n258\n00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.580\neverything is set up okay, but\nyou didn't actually allow for everything.\n\n259\n00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.190\nAnd now you wanna actually turn it on or\nuse this setting.\n\n260\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:42.010\nIt says, I'll essentially grandfather in\nthose that were already shared out, okay?\n\n261\n00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.982\nSo they'll actually be connected and\n\n262\n00:13:43.982 --> 00:13:47.130\nthey'll remain connected in\nthe way that we want to, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:53.560\nBut it does prevent new users thought\nfrom being able to connect them.\n\n264\n00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.548\nSo it's essentially saying all right,\n\n265\n00:13:55.548 --> 00:13:59.239\nIf you're already sharing that's\nall that we're allowing externally.\n\n266\n00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:01.159\nBut now if Cherokee comes along us,\n\n267\n00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:04.650\nI wanna add in ten of my\nconnections to this company.\n\n268\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.230\nThen no, external use or new,\n\n269\n00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.860\nI should say, new external users are going\nto be prevented from doing this.\n\n270\n00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.502\nOkay.\nSo\n\n271\n00:14:12.502 --> 00:14:15.350\nthis one blocks the new- Don't\ntake that Active Directory route.\n\n272\n00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.607\nThat is not the path they're taking.\n\n273\n00:14:16.607 --> 00:14:19.350\n[LAUGH] That's not exactly what\nthey're talking about here.\n\n274\n00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.840\nNow there's another one though,\nCherokee, which is this third option.\n\n275\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.450\nOkay.\n\n276\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:29.990\nAllow users to invite and\nshare with authenticated external users.\n\n277\n00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.160\nThat seems weird, doesn't it?\n\n278\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.940\nThat's a little bit more tricky\nin terms of the verbiage here.\n\n279\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.480\nYeah, I'm waiting for\nyour explanation on this one, Ronnie.\n\n280\n00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.670\nWell, this one's actually\nnot super difficult.\n\n281\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:44.920\nIf you like the Microsoft world of\nauthentication, which actually means\n\n282\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.060\nhey we won't allow it, but only if\nthey already have a Microsoft account.\n\n283\n00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:54.450\nNot anybody else's account, but if you\nalready have a Microsoft account and\n\n284\n00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.120\nthat means that they can do this here.\n\n285\n00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.930\nYeah, I've actually had a situation,\nnot too handy on the fly.\n\n286\n00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.640\nWhen I was about to teach a class out of\nstate and I had to share some documents.\n\n287\n00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.510\nAnd then we were fumbling around trying to\nget all these different accounts allowed.\n\n288\n00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.000\nAnd it just wasn't very streamlined.\n\n289\n00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.980\nYeah, but it does help you with\na couple of things, right?\n\n290\n00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.560\nI was able to share documents.\n\n291\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.910\nYou were able to share documents And not\nonly that though, they were authenticated.\n\n292\n00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.750\nSo it does actually show that hey,\nwe took this process.\n\n293\n00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.923\nYou accepted this option,\n\n294\n00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:27.939\nwhich means that they had to have at\nleast a Microsoft account to do so.\n\n295\n00:15:27.939 --> 00:15:33.000\nAnd is something that Office\n365 trusts inherently.\n\n296\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.455\nSo the great thing is it's not saying,\nhey,\n\n297\n00:15:35.455 --> 00:15:37.988\nI'm letting it wide open\nanything else here.\n\n298\n00:15:37.988 --> 00:15:40.212\nBut if you want it wide open,\n\n299\n00:15:40.212 --> 00:15:45.955\nthis is the last option that you have\nwhich is to allow sharing, okay?\n\n300\n00:15:45.955 --> 00:15:52.965\nTo authenticate external users and\nusing anonymous access links.\n\n301\n00:15:52.965 --> 00:15:56.366\nSo this one is kind of a combination\nof this third one right,\n\n302\n00:15:56.366 --> 00:15:57.874\nthat we already had okay.\n\n303\n00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.293\nBut then it also says what?\n\n304\n00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:04.602\nCherokee can just send a link to somebody\nand that will allow them to get access\n\n305\n00:16:04.602 --> 00:16:09.630\ninto you know that document or that folder\nor whatever it is that she's sharing out.\n\n306\n00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.920\n&gt;&gt; Might want to be a little\ncareful with that setting\n\n307\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.810\nright there\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah it really is a little bit\n\n308\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.770\nmind boggling about what\npeople accidentally share So\n\n309\n00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.610\nyou do need to take a look at, and\n\n310\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:25.010\nwe are gonna take a look at the idea of\ndata loss prevention in another episode.\n\n311\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.790\nBut overall though you do need\nto be careful about what you\n\n312\n00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.930\ntend to share out there if you allow for\nthese external links.\n\n313\n00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.870\nThe key behind this external\nlink idea is really kind\n\n314\n00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.410\nof what we have to focus in on as well.\n\n315\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.600\nThe very fact is,\nif Cherokee sends me an invitation and\n\n316\n00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.050\nsays here you can get access to this and\n\n317\n00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.130\nnow all of a sudden you know we\nstart working with it in my company.\n\n318\n00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.840\nAnd now, you know I'd go, that's right I\nremember Cherokee shared this with me let\n\n319\n00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.770\nme just go ahead and send you that link.\n\n320\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.310\nWell guess what, nobody's.\n\n321\n00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.520\n&gt;&gt; I didn't send it to that\nperson directly, therefore,\n\n322\n00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.800\nthey don't have access.\n\n323\n00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.580\n&gt;&gt; And so\nthat leads to a can of worms doesn't it?\n\n324\n00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.800\nYou didn't intentionally mean to\nshare it to somebody else, but\n\n325\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.050\nI did it on your behalf which I\ndidn't have the permission to do.\n\n326\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:12.330\nSo you can see why this would be a little\nbit hefty if you're trying to wonder here.\n\n327\n00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.310\nNow the great thing is that\njust because we allow for\n\n328\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:20.040\nsharing globally this way,\nit doesn't we have access to everything.\n\n329\n00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.917\nOkay it just mean that we are allowing for\nsharing to happen,okay,\n\n330\n00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:25.420\ninside my organization.\n\n331\n00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.010\nSo remember there is two step process,\nright.\n\n332\n00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.990\nOne they have to be able to\naccess my organization to\n\n333\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.190\nget access to what they really need.\n\n334\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.830\nSo at this point,\n\n335\n00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.520\nwe're just kind of taking a look at\nthat outer shell type of connection.\n\n336\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.560\nBut we're not completely done yet, let's\ngo ahead and take a look at some of these\n\n337\n00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.270\nother things that we need to focus in\non just for a moment or two as well.\n\n338\n00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:49.690\nOkay, so from inside of here notice I can\nactually make these links also expire\n\n339\n00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.790\nafter a particular period of time.\n\n340\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:56.640\nSo if Cherokee says I'm gonna share\nthis out to this group of people, but\n\n341\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.590\nI'm only gonna give them 24\nhours to be able to get this.\n\n342\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.290\nAfter that it's gonna be closed off.\n\n343\n00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.450\nShe can simply check mark this box and\ndo that.\n\n344\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.260\nBut also take a look at these\ntwo options right here.\n\n345\n00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:14.000\nAnonymous access links allow recipients\nto, well this would be weird right?\n\n346\n00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.430\nTo view and edit a file.\n\n347\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.110\nWell, what does that actually\nend up kind of resulting in?\n\n348\n00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:24.700\nWell it means that even though Cherokee\nmight have shared that out to me,\n\n349\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.160\nwhat I might do and go,\nCherokee made a mistake here.\n\n350\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.270\nLet me go ahead and\ncorrect her mistake, and\n\n351\n00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.170\nCherokee might say,\nno it really needs to be exactly this way.\n\n352\n00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.310\nAnd now I modify, and\n\n353\n00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:39.220\nthen the second person that Cherokee\nmight have sent that to you.\n\n354\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.680\nThat means I was able to modify,\nand edit that document,\n\n355\n00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.715\nand Cherokee didn't mean for\nit to be edited.\n\n356\n00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:48.790\nWell the great thing is you can change\nthat by simply selecting this, and\n\n357\n00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.540\ndoing the view, and\nthe same thing here with folders too.\n\n358\n00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.410\nSo either they can look in the files or\n\n359\n00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:59.310\nnotice this, view,\nedit and upload folders.\n\n360\n00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.310\nSheesh, that's kind of a lot\nwhen you talk about giving them,\n\n361\n00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:08.510\nallowing recipients to view, edit and\nupload folders and files, you name it.\n\n362\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.350\nThere's a lot of other\nthings also in here too.\n\n363\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.560\nAlso certain link types\nthat are also here.\n\n364\n00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.390\nNotice that it can actually be direct,\nonly to people who have permissions.\n\n365\n00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.840\nSo if they don't have permissions,\n\n366\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.920\nin other words they haven't\nalready clicked on that and\n\n367\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.490\nalready been granted permissions in here,\nthey won't be able to do so.\n\n368\n00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:32.060\nSo if they had previous permissions\nto access files, then they're fine.\n\n369\n00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.530\nBut if they don't now,\nthey're not gonna be able to, of course.\n\n370\n00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.830\nInternal, exactly what it says.\n\n371\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:41.380\nPeople in the organization only and\nthen the Anonymous one,\n\n372\n00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.230\nof course,\nis accessible to everyone as well, okay.\n\n373\n00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.623\nSo, Internal is only to the Office 365.\n\n374\n00:19:48.623 --> 00:19:51.852\nMost of the time,\nif we're gonna set the allow up here,\n\n375\n00:19:51.852 --> 00:19:56.410\nwe might also choose this one which\nis allow the anonymous access.\n\n376\n00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:02.140\nNow, there's only a couple of more here\nthat we need to take a look at to,\n\n377\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.010\nwhich are these additional settings.\n\n378\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.090\nNow, the way that these\nadditional settings work.\n\n379\n00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:11.460\nWe're really kind of massaging\nthe options that we picked so far, okay?\n\n380\n00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.800\nBut what we're taking a look at, is really\nthis highlighted yellow information here.\n\n381\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.680\nWhen users share via anonymous access\nlinks, people who receive the link\n\n382\n00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.420\ndon't need to sign in again\nto access the shared content,\n\n383\n00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.990\ntherefore these additional settings\ndon't apply to a anonymous links.\n\n384\n00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.310\nSo let say you've chosen this, so you\ndon't have to worry about anything else.\n\n385\n00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.820\nHere is what the actual\ncurrent settings are.\n\n386\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:40.490\nBut notice I can limit external\nsharing by using domains if I want to.\n\n387\n00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:46.310\nI can prevent external users from sharing\nfolders, files, and sites they don't own.\n\n388\n00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.220\nExternal users must accept\nsharing invitations\n\n389\n00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.760\nusing the same account that\nthe invitation was sent to.\n\n390\n00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.880\nSo this way, if I put a check mark here,\nyou can also end up seeing,\n\n391\n00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.120\nI have to change this, and then sometimes,\n\n392\n00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.330\nI'm trying to see if,\nI thought it dynamically changed.\n\n393\n00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.290\nThere it goes.\n\n394\n00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.040\nOnce you actually start\nchecking these things off,\n\n395\n00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.680\nyou'll see some different\nchanges here that go on.\n\n396\n00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.770\nSo one of the other\noptions of course is right\n\n397\n00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.400\nhere where I say Limit\nthe external sharing to domains.\n\n398\n00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.200\nAt this point when you have that notice\nthat you have this ability to go all\n\n399\n00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.590\nright, I'm not gonna allow for\nevery single global connection to connect\n\n400\n00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.050\nin my business but\nonly from these from this domain.\n\n401\n00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:32.900\nThat's great for things like business\npartners that you might have.\n\n402\n00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:38.830\nOr if you wanted to,\nyou could instead block this instead.\n\n403\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.980\nDon't allow sharing from users\nwith these blocked domains.\n\n404\n00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.720\nSo that way, you can make sure that you\nmight have some particular one domain\n\n405\n00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.050\nthat you don't want to actually\nbe able to ever get access in.\n\n406\n00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.630\nYou can do the same thing here, too.\n\n407\n00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.570\nSo just kind of be careful\n\n408\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.250\nwhen you actually choose which\none you want to be able to do.\n\n409\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.000\nAnd we'll use a combination of\nthese to really help us out.\n\n410\n00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.310\nBut for us,\nsince I've chosen anonymous access,\n\n411\n00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:09.490\nI'm gonna leave it at that\nat the global level here.\n\n412\n00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:13.711\nAnd then of course notification\nexactly like it sound here,\n\n413\n00:22:13.711 --> 00:22:17.766\nthe very fact is email,\nOneDrive for business owners, so\n\n414\n00:22:17.766 --> 00:22:21.654\nif we want these things to\nactually apply and get set up,\n\n415\n00:22:21.654 --> 00:22:26.154\nOther users invite additional\nexternal users to shared files.\n\n416\n00:22:26.154 --> 00:22:29.484\nThat will email whoever the owner is,\nokay, to be able to do this,\n\n417\n00:22:29.484 --> 00:22:32.330\nthe OneDrive business\nowners that they do that.\n\n418\n00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.440\nExternal users accept\ninvitations to access files.\n\n419\n00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.410\nI'll get an email about that as well.\n\n420\n00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.210\nAnonymous access links created or\n\n421\n00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:44.960\nchanged, I can also be notified of that\nif I'm the admin for the entire site.\n\n422\n00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:50.370\nBut setting something like this up\ngives me this ability at this time\n\n423\n00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.480\nto just simply go ahead and click OK.\n\n424\n00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.850\nAnd it's only part of the setting.\n\n425\n00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:59.280\nRemember that as we start to go\nthrough that now I've just said,\n\n426\n00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.180\nall right I'm allowing for\nexternal users to connect in.\n\n427\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.130\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie can we restrict\nsharing to the owner the site only?\n\n428\n00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.260\n&gt;&gt; You can and when we start\nto take a look at doing that,\n\n429\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.330\nwe're actually gonna do that\ninside of each particular site.\n\n430\n00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.310\nAnd we actually need to take a look at\nthat a little bit more in depth and\n\n431\n00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.430\nin detail but Cherokee,\nI think I've actually talked so\n\n432\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.710\nmuch that I've run us out of time.\n\n433\n00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.520\n&gt;&gt; It's all right Ronnie, we'll go ahead\nand create a part two for this show,\n\n434\n00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.600\nwe don't want to rush through it.\n\n435\n00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.360\nSo ladies and gentlemen,\nstay tuned for this show.\n\n436\n00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.590\nWe will go ahead and sign out.\n\n437\n00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.730\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n438\n00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:33.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n439\n00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.395\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n440\n00:23:35.395 --> 00:23:42.443\n[MUSIC]\n\n441\n00:23:42.443 -->

Well, thank you for having me back\nas we continue taking a look at this\n\n11\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.360\nfascinating world of SharePoint.\n\n12\n00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.540\nAnd I do say that a little bit\nfactitiously, but it is a big product\n\n13\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.460\ninside of SharePoint and something of\ncourse that we need to know, not only for\n\n14\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.603\nthe exam, but if you're going to be\nadministrating not just SharePoint.\n\n15\n00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:47.030\nNow, If you're going to be\nadministrating Office365, learning and\n\n16\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.050\ngetting inside on the SharePoint\ncomponent, especially when you have\n\n17\n00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.000\nfiles that need to be shared, are actually\ngoing to be critical and that's pretty\n\n18\n00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.310\nmuch every single organization, so you at\nleast need to know a little bit about it.\n\n19\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.430\nIn the previous episode, we went ahead and\ntook a look at least at the first half of\n\n20\n00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.210\nwhat needs to happen when we say that we\nneed external users to be able to connect\n\n21\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.940\nin to our Office 365 to gain access to\nfiles or document or whatever you want to\n\n22\n00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.740\ncall them, and the way that we did that\nis by taking the global settings here.\n\n23\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.200\nUnless we actually set\nthose global settings up,\n\n24\n00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.780\nwe're essentially giving somebody some\ntype of access at least into the house.\n\n25\n00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.680\nBut that doesn't mean we give access\nto every single room in the house,\n\n26\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.800\nit doesn't mean that we give\naccess to every single box that we\n\n27\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.410\nhave locked up in the house either, so\nat least at this point we can do that and\n\n28\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.640\nwe showed you where you could set\nit to very restrictive, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.310\nAnd then, we showed how you can\nactually set it up to say look,\n\n30\n00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.330\nI just need to allow for\naccess from the outside.\n\n31\n00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.660\nAnd normally that's probably the most\nconventional setting at the global side of\n\n32\n00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.560\nit because where we want to actually\nmake sure that we have granularity and\n\n33\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.190\ncontrol is going to be\nreally at a SharePoint site,\n\n34\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.420\nwhich is essentially a room, so I always\nlike to try and use analogies that way.\n\n35\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.110\nWhereas the organization\nis like our house,\n\n36\n00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.180\nwhere I may give somebody access to it,\nbut\n\n37\n00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.580\nevery single door is gonna be locked in\nterms of getting access to certain files.\n\n38\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.820\nSo, what I'll now actually do is I\nchange the locks on in each one of\n\n39\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.040\nthose things and\nthat's what we call sites instead.\n\n40\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.130\nSo, in that sense,\nwe can now go into each site and\n\n41\n00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.240\nconfigure once again sharing, so\nthat users can gain access to them too.\n\n42\n00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.680\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, I kind of have to change\nmy thinking because when you say site,\n\n43\n00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.070\nI kind of, I mean,\nI'm in the active directory mindset and\n\n44\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.720\nI think about site as being kind of\nbound by a physical location, but\n\n45\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.220\nwhen we're talking about site here in\nOffice 365, we really don't see that.\n\n46\n00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.520\n&gt;&gt; No, you really don't.\n\n47\n00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.390\nSo, it is changing a logic, in a sense,\nbut the easiest way to think about it is\n\n48\n00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.370\nas a website, I think that's probably\nthe easiest analogy that you can use.\n\n49\n00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.730\nIs that you have access\nto a web portal and\n\n50\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.480\neither you can get full access to it or\nwe can actually\n\n51\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.500\nrestrict down to the permission level\nto where you might be able to gain\n\n52\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.160\njust access to a single file that might\navailable on that website or not.\n\n53\n00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.110\nBut, that's at least the way that\nI think about it that if you're\n\n54\n00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.100\nunfamiliar with SharePoint sites it's\nprior easy now for you to use, but\n\n55\n00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.310\nfor us so it pretty much is that way.\n\n56\n00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.660\nSo, let's take a look at\nhow we're going to do this.\n\n57\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.280\nSo, here on my screen, what you end up\nseeing inside the SharePoint admin center\n\n58\n00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.910\nis, of course, well, multiple sites.\n\n59\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.950\nSome of these I have created, some of\nthese, of course, well, it was created\n\n60\n00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.200\nwhen we created the SharePoint account or\nthe Office 365 account.\n\n61\n00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.500\nAnd if I come here into my PowerShell,\n\n62\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.130\nI'm just gonna do get spo for\nSharePoint online site, and\n\n63\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.870\nwhen I do this, it'll show you who\nactually owns these things, right?\n\n64\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.710\nSo, here is the URL, which again leads\nmore to that idea that I was telling you\n\n65\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.120\nabout of the site is not being\na logical location at some sort, or\n\n66\n00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.140\na grouping, that actually being what,\nan actual website itself.\n\n67\n00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.190\nSo, a URL and then the owner, and\nyou'll notice some of these are blank, but\n\n68\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.020\nyou can see here's the two that I\ncreated with a Joey account and\n\n69\n00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.820\nthis signifies who the owner is these\nother ones are the ones that were\n\n70\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.670\nessentially created by,\nwell when it actually got created.\n\n71\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.410\n&gt;&gt; The system generated it?\n\n72\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.520\n&gt;&gt; Yep, the system generated\nones that you end up seeing.\n\n73\n00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.450\nSo, you can see something like\nthat when you take a look there.\n\n74\n00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.450\nSo, let's take for an example the London\nsite at this particular point here, so\n\n75\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.130\nnow that I have where we can access this,\nglobally from the outside,\n\n76\n00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.150\nlet's set it up,\nset this up for our users or\n\n77\n00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.140\nfor business partners that may be inside\nof London or that may be near London if\n\n78\n00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.220\nI want to, and I want them to only access\nthese files that I'm gonna put here.\n\n79\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.450\nWell, I simply can put a check\nmark right here in front\n\n80\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.290\nof the actual London site and when I do\nyou actually notice that all of these\n\n81\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.720\nicons up here at the top end up lighting\nup, let me go ahead and do that again.\n\n82\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.807\nSo, now notice when I took away that,\n\n83\n00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:12.183\nyou actually see where this kind of grayed\nout and went into the background, but\n\n84\n00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:15.184\nthen, when I came here to London and\nI put a check mark,\n\n85\n00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:19.212\nnotice how these now have lit up and\n[CROSSTALK] now are in the foreground.\n\n86\n00:05:19.212 --> 00:05:23.324\nSo, at this point, if I want to\nbe able to allow external users,\n\n87\n00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:27.211\nthis is where, not only do they\nhave access now to the house or\n\n88\n00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:32.290\nto my organization, but now I can\nrestrict the access or allow access.\n\n89\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.160\nSo, I simply come up here to this bar\nwhere it says site collections and\n\n90\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.170\ninside of this tab I now have sharing,\nand when I do this, we're actually end\n\n91\n00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.460\nup saying, this can take a moment because\nit's a little bit time to generate here.\n\n92\n00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.250\nOnce everything is actually up you kind to\nsee some of these same things that we saw\n\n93\n00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.570\nin the global configuration.\n\n94\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.170\nNotice again,\neven the same verbage just about, right?\n\n95\n00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.660\nSharing outside your company,\n\n96\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.540\ncontrol how users invite people outside\nof your organization to access your\n\n97\n00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.925\ncontent and you'll see that the verbage\nhere is pretty much just about the same.\n\n98\n00:06:08.925 --> 00:06:12.425\nDon't allow sharing outside\nof your organization, okay?\n\n99\n00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:15.495\nAnd it really still\ncompletes that same idea.\n\n100\n00:06:15.495 --> 00:06:18.745\n&gt;&gt; We're just kind of narrowing\nin on our scope here,\n\n101\n00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:22.225\nwhereas before we were looking at global\nand now we are looking at the site level.\n\n102\n00:06:22.225 --> 00:06:23.135\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n103\n00:06:23.135 --> 00:06:26.935\nyou have to, you kind of have to\nplay a balance of this thing, right?\n\n104\n00:06:26.935 --> 00:06:30.080\nIf you restrict it too much\nat the global level, well,\n\n105\n00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.590\nit might be where they can't even gain.\n\n106\n00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.250\n&gt;&gt; Get past that layer.\n\n107\n00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.030\n&gt;&gt; You won't be given access to the sites.\n\n108\n00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.740\nSo, if you go, no, you're supposed to\ngain access to the New York City site,\n\n109\n00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.010\nbut not to the London one, well,\nI can't even connect in, well,\n\n110\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.660\nyou might have to check those global\nsettings to help you out here.\n\n111\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.270\nSo, just kind of realize that you\ncan put yourself into a weird\n\n112\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.220\nconundrum at times if you're\nnot careful about these things.\n\n113\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.910\nThe great thing about this\nparticular dialogue box,\n\n114\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.780\nthough, is that it actually changes and\nlets you know.\n\n115\n00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.240\nFor example,\nthe one that's actually set up here\n\n116\n00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.300\nallows sharing with all external\nusers by using anonymous links.\n\n117\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.530\nWell, notice it tells me the status,\nallow,\n\n118\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.450\nthis is the default setting for new sites.\n\n119\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.340\nSo when you first create a site,\nit says, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n120\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.890\nallow this sharing to happen for everyone.\n\n121\n00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.070\nSome sites in this site collection allow\nnonowners to grant permissions to files,\n\n122\n00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.350\nfolders, sites,\nsubsites without requiring owner approval.\n\n123\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.350\nWow, that's pretty good,\nthat's pretty not restrictive at all.\n\n124\n00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.080\nThen, if I select the don't allow sharing,\nthat's another one, and\n\n125\n00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.440\nwe're gonna come back to\nthat one in a moment too.\n\n126\n00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.066\nBut you can actually see right down here\nwhere it says hey allow this is default\n\n127\n00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:44.628\nsetting, hold on this is not what we want,\n\n128\n00:07:44.628 --> 00:07:49.419\nthere is new site collection that should\nchange, but apparently that did not.\n\n129\n00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:54.940\nLet me see, there it is, it actually just\ntook that link cuz why that changing but\n\n130\n00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.925\nnot changing the wording here So it's\nat still 100 default as I click OK and\n\n131\n00:07:59.925 --> 00:08:03.150\nApply down here toward the bottom.\n\n132\n00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.570\nNow when everything is done,\n\n133\n00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.150\nthat's when we'll actually change\nwhat it says here instead.\n\n134\n00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.540\nBut these are settings that we\nwent over in the previous episode,\n\n135\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.270\nas far as what their\nmeanings actually are.\n\n136\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.600\nNow what we want to do though,\nlet's say that at this particular point\n\n137\n00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.070\nIs that we want to actually kind of go\nall right, maybe I'll share this out but\n\n138\n00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.980\nin the previous episode,\nCherokee you had this question.\n\n139\n00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.140\nSo let's see if we can actually get that\nquestion again about the owners here.\n\n140\n00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\nare we able to just have the owner of this\n\n141\n00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.680\nsite be the individual who can share\nout particular components of that site.\n\n142\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.440\nIs that the only person\nthat can have control or\n\n143\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.600\ncan we delegate that in some way?\n\n144\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.370\n&gt;&gt; Well to a point right the very\nfact is you can have that control.\n\n145\n00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.270\nYou can delegate it to other\nSharePoint administrators,\n\n146\n00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:54.810\nbut the key here though is to understand\nthat when you do this okay, it is tricky.\n\n147\n00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.590\nAnd that's pretty much the idea here.\n\n148\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.060\nSo let me show you what can\nhappen when you start doing this.\n\n149\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.640\nSo right here,\neverything that didn't change.\n\n150\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.910\nNotice that there was this link here.\n\n151\n00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:11.720\nIt says, Turn off sharing for non owners\non all sites in this site collection.\n\n152\n00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.700\nSo, if you do something like this,\n\n153\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.130\nyou're essentially limiting\nit to just the owners.\n\n154\n00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.660\nNot only in that though,\nthe global SharePoint administrator and\n\n155\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.350\nsomebody like that.\n\n156\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.370\nBut essentially you're saying don't\nallow sharing except to that.\n\n157\n00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.580\nNow you have to be very careful\nbecause this is just simply a link,\n\n158\n00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.350\nat least that's what you think.\n\n159\n00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:37.310\nThat what it might do is kind of bring\nup an explanation about what can happen,\n\n160\n00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.300\nwhat can do that.\n\n161\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.870\n&gt;&gt; But it's almost like a toggle switch.\n\n162\n00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is a toggle switch.\n\n163\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.880\nAnd when you do something like this,\n\n164\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.350\nand you're not careful,\nyou're gonna find out something.\n\n165\n00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.790\nIt is a challenge to get it re-enabled.\n\n166\n00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.720\nSo once you do this, you will jump\nthrough hoops to get this thing actually\n\n167\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.580\nturned back off so that you can\nactually do some of the sharing.\n\n168\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.500\nBut once you actually set that up, and you\ndon't, in other words, once you actually\n\n169\n00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.450\nturn off all sharing for non-site owners,\nwell, all of these goes away.\n\n170\n00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.770\nYou don't get any of these access and\n\n171\n00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.450\nthen you're wondering like\nwhere do I go to allow that.\n\n172\n00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.790\nAll the other options that you\nend up having will be grayed out\n\n173\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.240\nis not just going to work for you.\n\n174\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.000\nSo, I wanted to make sure that\nI mentioned that because it\n\n175\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.640\nis a challenge here to do this.\n\n176\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.230\nSo if you select something like that.\n\n177\n00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.220\n&gt;&gt; Make sure to beware.\n\n178\n00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.370\n&gt;&gt; That is something that you're\ngonna beware of, and we'll do this,\n\n179\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.480\nbut let's do this toward the end\nof the episode instead, so\n\n180\n00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.420\nthat we can show you that,\nwhen we do that.\n\n181\n00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.300\nBut overall though, this is really\nwhere it gets onto this bigger point.\n\n182\n00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.150\nSo let's do something else here, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.650\nThat will allow us to restrict access and\nshow you\n\n184\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.720\nwhat the end user ends up seeing when\nthey do something like this too, okay.\n\n185\n00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.480\nSo let's say that we want\nto allow sharing with\n\n186\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.390\nall external users which is the default\nhere, but I want to change this up and\n\n187\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:06.250\nI'm going to simply put a check mark here,\nLimit external sharing by domain.\n\n188\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:12.450\nSo when I do that, oops,\nit keeps kind of zipping on me here.\n\n189\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.170\nEnter domains here.\n\n190\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.700\nI'm gonna simply type in well, my domain.\n\n191\n00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.195\n&gt;&gt; So this is where those external\nusers such as any kind of temporary\n\n192\n00:11:20.195 --> 00:11:23.014\nbusiness partners,\ncontractors, subcontractors.\n\n193\n00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:26.716\nIf you know their particular domain you\ndon't have to add them to your domain,\n\n194\n00:11:26.716 --> 00:11:29.370\nbut you can just add them in here,\njust share this info.\n\n195\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now as you're actually\nadding them into access,\n\n196\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.510\nremember you gotta\nchange this option here,\n\n197\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.730\nAllow sharing only with\nusers from these domains.\n\n198\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.090\nNow let's say I wanted to\nactually block this, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.480\nSo I wanted to make sure that,\nhey, somebody from ITProTV\n\n200\n00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.010\ndoes not gain access into this\nparticular site if I wanted to.\n\n201\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:55.930\nSo I can simply select that, and\nnow when I do so, I can click Save here.\n\n202\n00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.340\nAnd, hopefully I clicked Save,\nand in a moment\n\n203\n00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.060\neverything should kind of start spinning\nand doing what we want to do and\n\n204\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.600\nthat should now allow for\nthat collection, there it goes.\n\n205\n00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.380\nI'm trying to see if, okay it's loading,\nsite collection is being updated.\n\n206\n00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.110\nAnd we get the little spinning Cheerio.\n\n207\n00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.520\n&gt;&gt; Why would anyone wanna\nblock ITProTV Ronnie?\n\n208\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.330\n&gt;&gt; Nobody would, but for an example, this\nis something that we do want to show and\n\n209\n00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.500\ndemonstrate here.\n\n210\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.010\nAnd I didn't wanna block\neverybody else for right now.\n\n211\n00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.910\nSo let's take an example that this\nis happening where we are actually\n\n212\n00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.530\nblocking now access to the London site.\n\n213\n00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:41.510\nAnd in a moment hopefully all that green\nspinny thing will kind of go away here and\n\n214\n00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.580\nshow me that everything is now\nset up the way that we want to.\n\n215\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:51.120\nNow when we start to upload files into\na SharePoint site, that's normally\n\n216\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.660\nwhen we begin to share out things, and\nwhere we can actually take a look at this.\n\n217\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.950\nAnd so that's what we want to do here.\n\n218\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.820\nI was hoping that by this point,\nit would kind of be done.\n\n219\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.270\nBut it still waiting a little bit here,\nokay.\n\n220\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.940\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie if we are using this share\npoint GUI, is there an additional way?\n\n221\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.000\nI know that we spoke about\nthis in previous episodes.\n\n222\n00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.270\nThat Microsoft is really pushing\nPowerShell, but can these types of\n\n223\n00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.630\nactivities be accomplished through\nthat command line interface as well?\n\n224\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.930\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can actually go ahead and\n\n225\n00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.810\ndo all of this in PowerShell\nif you choose to.\n\n226\n00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.070\nBut this is kinda one of those\nwhere it's a bear to do,\n\n227\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.470\nas far as every step along the way.\n\n228\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.940\nAnd we're gonna actually say what\nparticular setting that we're gonna do,\n\n229\n00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.980\nand exactly what's gonna be done.\n\n230\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.820\nIt can all be done in PowerShell.\n\n231\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.380\nBut there is something that we are gonna\ndo in PowerShell in just a moment here.\n\n232\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.970\nI was hoping that it was, there it goes.\n\n233\n00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.610\nThat was great.\n\n234\n00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.230\nS there it was, I'm just trying to\nstall for a little bit of time.\n\n235\n00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.980\nSo now let's go ahead and do this.\n\n236\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.920\nI'm gonna switch on over\nto another computer,\n\n237\n00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.480\nwhich is gonna be Lance's computer.\n\n238\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.330\nYou can see that up here in\nthe upper right hand corner.\n\n239\n00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:57.000\nI'm gonna log into that\nSharePoint site as well.\n\n240\n00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.880\nAnd this is where we are, so\ngood, it's actually ready there.\n\n241\n00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.080\nSo you can see, for example,\nit might make me log, of course it did.\n\n242\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.790\nIt's gonna make me log back out and\nlog back in.\n\n243\n00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.480\nAnd you know how easy it is for\n\n244\n00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.086\nme to type in a password here,\nwhich means this is a 50/50 chance.\n\n245\n00:14:12.086 --> 00:14:13.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That I'm\n\n246\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.670\ngonna actually get this right here.\n\n247\n00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.540\n&gt;&gt; Look, you did well.\n\n248\n00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.240\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n249\n00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.320\nso let me go ahead and close out of\nthat because that's from the older one.\n\n250\n00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.400\nSo let's say that what we have here,\nof course, is Office 365 and\n\n251\n00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.910\nnow Cherokee has asked Lance, okay, for\n\n252\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.700\na document that she wants to,\nthat he needs to share out to her.\n\n253\n00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:44.760\nSo when it signs in to SharePoint, and\nonce we actually get into SharePoint.\n\n254\n00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.490\nAnd let's say that Cherokee\nis in London at this point,\n\n255\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.430\nso I can go to the London site.\n\n256\n00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.930\n&gt;&gt; Sounds nice.\n\n257\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.300\n&gt;&gt; And now here is the Document Center.\n\n258\n00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.912\nOver on the left hand side,\nthen Lance can select Documents and\n\n259\n00:14:58.912 --> 00:15:03.101\nnow let's say it this Patch\nmanagement best practices.\n\n260\n00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:07.240\nI just pulled the document from\nmy computer to help us out.\n\n261\n00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:14.810\nSo if I select that one and\nnow I click on the Share link here, okay.\n\n262\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.010\nThis is where we can go ahead and\ninvite people,\n\n263\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:22.590\ndo whatever we want to to try and\nget this to actually work here, okay.\n\n264\n00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.250\nSo once we get to this point,\n\n265\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:30.126\nI can then type in let's say Cherokee\nif I can spell her name right.\n\n266\n00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:31.970\n@itpro.tv.\n\n267\n00:15:34.348 --> 00:15:36.020\nAll right.\n\n268\n00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.130\nSo nothing has happened yet Cherokee.\n\n269\n00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.070\nSo the only thing I actually\nneed to do at this point.\n\n270\n00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.070\n&gt;&gt; Not looking good for the home team.\n\n271\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.189\n&gt;&gt; Is click Share.\n\n272\n00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:43.780\nLook at that.\n\n273\n00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.963\nLook at what it says right away here.\n\n274\n00:15:46.963 --> 00:15:51.968\nYour organization doesn't allow\nsharing with users from this domain.\n\n275\n00:15:51.968 --> 00:15:56.619\nCherokee, you've been blocked out\nof this particular best practices.\n\n276\n00:15:56.619 --> 00:15:58.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Probably hasn't been\nthe first time in my life [LAUGH].\n\n277\n00:15:58.531 --> 00:16:03.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so,\nnow let's if it's actually just Cherokee.\n\n278\n00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:05.820\nOops.\n\n279\n00:16:08.746 --> 00:16:10.408\nSo we'll try it again.\n\n280\n00:16:12.778 --> 00:16:15.230\nI'll just take Cherokee's name out.\n\n281\n00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.090\nLook at that?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n282\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.760\nI feel a little bit better,\nit's not just me.\n\n283\n00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's not just Cherokee.\n\n284\n00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.540\nSo the entire domain, essentially,\nhas now been blocked out.\n\n285\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.163\nWell, this is actually something\nthat because it not only says hey,\n\n286\n00:16:27.163 --> 00:16:31.348\nit's blocked, it also says, look,\nyou need to contact your IT department for\n\n287\n00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:33.167\na help here in why this is going on.\n\n288\n00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:35.149\n&gt;&gt; That's great unless you\nare the IT department [LAUGH].\n\n289\n00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:36.387\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unless you are the IT department.\n\n290\n00:16:36.387 --> 00:16:41.259\nNow, there is a bunch of other things that\nwe can do which I think we're gonna get\n\n291\n00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:42.080\ninto later.\n\n292\n00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.270\nI'm trying to make sure that I\nremember everything correctly.\n\n293\n00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.800\nBut there are things that we call tits,\n\n294\n00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.390\nthat instead can say hey,\nyou can override this if you choose to.\n\n295\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.490\nSo it depends on the admin department\nof whether or not you allow them that.\n\n296\n00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.480\nBut you can give them what is call pro\ntips, I think is what it's called,\n\n297\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.340\nthat says, hey, we're blocking this,\nbut if you want to, you can\n\n298\n00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:07.060\ncontact the administrator and he can see\nwhether or not you wanna do this or not,\n\n299\n00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.530\nper user basis or per domain basis or\nyou can do it this way.\n\n300\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.540\nSo it is very possible\ndepending on what we need.\n\n301\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.060\nBut this effectively at least shows us\nthat the SharePoint policy even though it\n\n302\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.470\ntook a few minutes cuz it always feels\nlike it takes 15 minutes when you're\n\n303\n00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.778\nwaiting on a little spinning curio right\nthere, that's the way that Wes calls it.\n\n304\n00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:27.280\n&gt;&gt; Spinning curio.\n[LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.797\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what he calls it,\n\n306\n00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:30.757\nI think a spinning curio, to get through.\n\n307\n00:17:30.757 --> 00:17:34.128\nBut I not only took like two or three\nminutes but it still felt like an eternity\n\n308\n00:17:34.128 --> 00:17:37.512\nand that's one of the things that you\nhave to deal with in SharePoint, too.\n\n309\n00:17:37.512 --> 00:17:41.321\nYou gotta remember that not everything\ntakes place immediately, and\n\n310\n00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:45.322\nsomethings may but the majority of\ntime and especially with SharePoint,\n\n311\n00:17:45.322 --> 00:17:49.062\nbecause of how it's spread out\nacross the planet, and it really is,\n\n312\n00:17:49.062 --> 00:17:52.902\nyour organization,\nwherever you go is spread out some where.\n\n313\n00:17:52.902 --> 00:17:56.530\nBecause of the way it's spread out among\nthe planet, it may take a little bit of\n\n314\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.920\ntime before everything is updated,\nwhen things are actually applied here.\n\n315\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.250\nSo just kind of be aware of that,\nthat it does take a little bit of time.\n\n316\n00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:10.115\nAll right, so at least there we can\nsee the effective use of that sharing\n\n317\n00:18:10.115 --> 00:18:13.720\nif we wanted to,\nthe limit to do what I want to.\n\n318\n00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.320\nSo now let's go on back,\n\n319\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.930\nI'm gonna switch back now into\nthe admin console for Joey here.\n\n320\n00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.200\nAnd then I'm going to select London again,\n\n321\n00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.020\nand I'm going to remove\nthat sharing just in case.\n\n322\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.390\nI know in a previous episode\nas I was doing this I ended\n\n323\n00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.680\nup affecting another show.\n\n324\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.830\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nturn that off.\n\n325\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:39.390\nNow it shouldn't affect anything for\nthat other show for right now.\n\n326\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:40.450\nBut you just never know.\n\n327\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.770\nActually, I think I'm gonna leave it,\nbecause if not, it's probably gonna take\n\n328\n00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.860\nsome time before it actually updates and\ndoes some other things here, okay?\n\n329\n00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.860\nSo the question that you had asked and\n\n330\n00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:56.088\nI was kinda holding off because it\ndoes take some time for us to do this.\n\n331\n00:18:56.088 --> 00:19:00.940\nIs that if we wanted to say, hey look,\nI really want to eliminate sharing.\n\n332\n00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.390\nSo let's say that Cherokee by accident\ncreated this and now everything is going\n\n333\n00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.790\non and I just quickly need to go ahead and\neliminate that.\n\n334\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.860\nBut if I delete the site, it might also\ndelete all of those files in the site too.\n\n335\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.550\nSo at this point-\n&gt;&gt; It might delete all the files in this\n\n336\n00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.251\nsite, Ronie?\n\n337\n00:19:17.251 --> 00:19:19.130\n&gt;&gt; It could, yeah,\nyou just don't know, right?\n\n338\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.860\nSo are you willing to risk that chance\nthat you can't get access to those\n\n339\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.150\nfiles anymore.\n\n340\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:28.870\nSo at this point, let's say that what\nwe want to do instead is that we choose\n\n341\n00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.240\nto just use this option.\n\n342\n00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.060\nLet's go in and take a look again.\n\n343\n00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.420\nTurn off sharing for non-owners.\n\n344\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.340\nSo let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n345\n00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.640\nOnce I do that, now notice?\n\n346\n00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.652\nOops.\n\n347\n00:19:42.652 --> 00:19:44.498\nActually, that's being updated.\n\n348\n00:19:44.498 --> 00:19:45.970\n&gt;&gt; Whenever you say oops, it worries me.\n\n349\n00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's because it just flips so\nquickly here, right?\n\n350\n00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.270\nSo I wasn't exactly sure\nwhat ended up happening.\n\n351\n00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.250\nSo there it is,\nthere's that little green option there.\n\n352\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.470\nI'm hoping that it will allow me.\n\n353\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.100\nSo it's just kind of waiting there.\n\n354\n00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.200\nOnce everything is done and we'll end up\nseeing something that is very difficult\n\n355\n00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.230\nfor us to actually see anything else and\ndifficult for us to change.\n\n356\n00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.140\nAnd this is where\nthe SharePoint access and\n\n357\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.950\nthe administration becomes less intuitive.\n\n358\n00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.920\nSo let's say, Cherokee, that you\nwere going through those settings.\n\n359\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.511\nJust like what we were\nbefore here on the sharing.\n\n360\n00:20:24.297 --> 00:20:28.237\nAnd now, even though it says\nallows everything to go on,\n\n361\n00:20:28.237 --> 00:20:34.250\nnotice allowing non-owners to invite\nnew users, status not allowed, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.760\nOnly owners can invite\nnew ones which is fine.\n\n363\n00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.600\nSo, how do I turn that off?\n\n364\n00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.530\nSo, if I select,\ndon't allow sharing, right?\n\n365\n00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.490\nThat doesn't actually turn this off,\nthat will actually end up staying, okay?\n\n366\n00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:57.260\nSo, you don't have a good way to turn\nthat off even inside of the global\n\n367\n00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:02.750\nadmin console here, there is nothing\nthat actually turns that off.\n\n368\n00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.460\nSo you might go, all right,\nso if I select London site,\n\n369\n00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.130\nI should have gone to properties, okay?\n\n370\n00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:12.820\nAnd inside of properties,\nI should be able to turn that off, right?\n\n371\n00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.410\nIt's not here, okay?\n\n372\n00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.060\nI'm not creating a new one,\nI'm not trying to buy storage,\n\n373\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.460\nI'm not trying to change ownership.\n\n374\n00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.740\nI'm not trying to do any of that.\n\n375\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.380\nBut what I need to do is, I need to\ngo back to properties here just for\n\n376\n00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:32.050\na moment, so that I can click on this\nlink which is that website address.\n\n377\n00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.415\nAnd this will bring me into\nthe admin portal for that site.\n\n378\n00:21:35.415 --> 00:21:36.750\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n379\n00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.970\n&gt;&gt; Now, once you're here,\nyou go all right.\n\n380\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.880\nSo now,\n&gt;&gt; We're getting close.\n\n381\n00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.738\n&gt;&gt; We're getting close except that\nnothing says, these aren't settings.\n\n382\n00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:49.890\nThese are either just\ncontent list libraries.\n\n383\n00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:55.190\nAnd then when you take a look around here,\nsharing, following, uploading a document.\n\n384\n00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.930\nThat's a little bit scary at this point,\nright?\n\n385\n00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.760\nBut you have to click on the gear, okay?\n\n386\n00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.760\nAnd then in the gear, you have got.\n\n387\n00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.350\nSo edit page, content, adding that,\n\n388\n00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:15.810\nshared with, change site settings,\nyou have to into site settings.\n\n389\n00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.310\nAnd now look, Cherokee,\nlook how intuitive this is, I mean,\n\n390\n00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:23.790\nwhat are the chances with all\nof the links that you have right\n\n391\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:28.870\nhere that you're gonna easily find\nexactly what setting is going to be.\n\n392\n00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.250\n&gt;&gt; Site administration?\n\n393\n00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.740\nWhat are the options we have here?\n\n394\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.450\nLet's see.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, if you say site\n\n395\n00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.270\ncollection administration, look at it.\n\n396\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.910\nI mean there are so\nmany different things, right?\n\n397\n00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.140\nBut you would think that you're right,\nbut you're not,\n\n398\n00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.830\ncuz that's the first place I went.\n\n399\n00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.120\n&gt;&gt; I would definitely say when making\nchanges within this interface,\n\n400\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.640\nI would only wanna make\none change at a time,\n\n401\n00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.850\nbecause if I make a couple different\nchanges, I'm not really sure what or\n\n402\n00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.420\nwho I'm affecting, so I would wanna\ntake that precaution for sure.\n\n403\n00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.690\n&gt;&gt; So if you wanna enable that setting,\nyou have to come up here to Users and\n\n404\n00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.830\nPermission, go figure, okay?\n\n405\n00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.350\nAnd then Site Permissions.\n\n406\n00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.050\nAnd once you're actually inside of Site\nPermissions, you go all right, I'm inside\n\n407\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:16.220\nof site permissions, grant permissions,\ncreate a group, check permissions,\n\n408\n00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.590\npermission level, site collection\nadministrators, access request settings?\n\n409\n00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.965\n&gt;&gt; I'll have access request settings for\n500 Alex.\n\n410\n00:23:23.965 --> 00:23:24.988\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n411\n00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:27.548\nit would be access request settings.\n\n412\n00:23:27.548 --> 00:23:30.492\nSo now that I have that, now look,\n\n413\n00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:35.580\nthree different check boxes,\nwhat do you actually check?\n\n414\n00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.380\nYeah, see, it's not intuitive, right?\n\n415\n00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.732\nIt doesn't say, here's how you get rid\nof this or to disable this setting,\n\n416\n00:23:41.732 --> 00:23:44.048\nyou have to actually uncheck all three.\n\n417\n00:23:44.048 --> 00:23:48.891\nYou have to check all three of these,\nand then you can click OK.\n\n418\n00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:51.978\nAnd once you do that,\nit takes several minutes.\n\n419\n00:23:51.978 --> 00:23:57.656\nAnd then that is when you can go\nback to your cycle actions here.\n\n420\n00:23:57.656 --> 00:24:02.910\nFrom that point, select sharing again,\nat least I hope.\n\n421\n00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.830\n[LAUGH] That's what should happen there.\n\n422\n00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.405\nIn a moment, it should pop up and\nthat should be gone.\n\n423\n00:24:07.405 --> 00:24:10.839\nBut it's amazing that this is\nwhat you have to do just to,\n\n424\n00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:14.359\nI mean that was by accidentally\nclicking on that one link.\n\n425\n00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n426\n00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.400\n&gt;&gt; That to find that\nwas fairly challenging,\n\n427\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.430\nto be able to do something like that.\n\n428\n00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.970\nAnd now I notice, there it is,\nallowed again, right?\n\n429\n00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:27.320\nSo it shows you that it's not intuitive.\n\n430\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.710\nSo if you're gonna spend time, right?\n\n431\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.290\nBecause this is a good quarter of\nthe exam, this is what you have to do.\n\n432\n00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.160\nYou gotta spend time or\nit's not gonna work at all, but\n\n433\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.900\njust kinda realize that yes,\nit takes time, is not easy,\n\n434\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.760\nthere is nothing intuitive about\nthis you just have to learn it.\n\n435\n00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.790\nThat's pretty much the way it goes in\nterms of being able to share it with\n\n436\n00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.130\nexternal users.\n\n437\n00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.122\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhat are we gonna look at next?\n\n438\n00:24:50.122 --> 00:24:52.084\nDo we have time to look at it\nfrom a PowerShell perspective, or\n\n439\n00:24:52.084 --> 00:24:53.237\ndo you wanna go ahead and save that?\n\n440\n00:24:53.237 --> 00:24:57.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's only one particular\ncommand that we're looking at now.\n\n441\n00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:58.770\nWe've got a lot of PowerShell coming up,\n\n442\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.290\nbut it's not gonna be done\nin five minutes here.\n\n443\n00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.450\nBut there is one command,\n\n444\n00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.880\nwhich is that same restriction that\nwe had to do exactly this here.\n\n445\n00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.220\nSo the same thing that we just did\naccidentally, you can do on purpose.\n\n446\n00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.220\n&gt;&gt; We're going to break it again?\n\n447\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're actually\ngoing to do this on purpose.\n\n448\n00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:18.840\nI know, it's kind of weird, but\nlet's go back to PowerShell.\n\n449\n00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.830\nAnd when you do something like this,\n\n450\n00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:25.140\nyou just wanna make sure that\nyou understand this command.\n\n451\n00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.215\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin there just a little bit.\n\n452\n00:25:27.215 --> 00:25:31.020\nSet-SPOSite, oops.\n\n453\n00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.286\nI always do it a little bit too quickly.\n\n454\n00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:40.594\nAnd then I need to set the identity\nof which one I'm actually\n\n455\n00:25:40.594 --> 00:25:43.066\ntaking a look at here, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:43.066 --> 00:25:47.746\nSo I can do this for\nany of the sites here,\n\n457\n00:25:47.746 --> 00:25:55.742\nI'm simply going to pick\nthe Officeprodemoco.sharepoint.com,\n\n458\n00:25:55.742 --> 00:26:01.664\nand I'm just gonna leave it at that for\nright now and\n\n459\n00:26:01.664 --> 00:26:08.871\njust do one,\nwhich is DisableSharingForNonOwners, okay?\n\n460\n00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:14.566\nSo, that is the entire command,\nthat if you needed to turn it off,\n\n461\n00:26:14.566 --> 00:26:18.637\nin other words disable it for\nall non-owners,\n\n462\n00:26:18.637 --> 00:26:24.059\nmake sure you pay attention here for\nthis entire command here.\n\n463\n00:26:28.298 --> 00:26:30.370\nAll right?\n\n464\n00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.420\nHopefully, I was pressing Enter, I was\ntrying to make sure I pressed it there.\n\n465\n00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.290\nSo once you actually start seeing that it\nwill run through the same thing that we\n\n466\n00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.420\njust did.\n\n467\n00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.780\nBut of course that means that\nit's actually disabled now too.\n\n468\n00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:43.650\nBut you do have that,\n\n469\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:48.190\nyou have this ability to disable it for\neverybody just using this.\n\n470\n00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.760\nNow, remember that what I said.\n\n471\n00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.690\nCan you do all this in PowerShell?\n\n472\n00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:58.420\nEvery single thing that we show you, it is\npossible, but it is quite a bear to do.\n\n473\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.840\nAnd you might be going, well,\nRonnie, you're just chickening out.\n\n474\n00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.810\nIt's not just chickening out, the very\nfact is you're not gonna get, it's so\n\n475\n00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.920\nlong, you're not gonna have time.\n\n476\n00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.830\nEspecially when you're getting ready for\nthe exam.\n\n477\n00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:13.690\nBut this command right here, which is\na very effective and powerful command yes,\n\n478\n00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.190\nthis is something you are going to do.\n\n479\n00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.980\nNow you think that we are avoiding\nPowerShell, we are not.\n\n480\n00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.884\nBut there is more that we have to do,\n\n481\n00:27:19.884 --> 00:27:23.956\nand the next little episode that we'll\nhave is pretty much all PowerShell.\n\n482\n00:27:23.956 --> 00:27:26.108\nSo you don't wanna miss that one.\n\n483\n00:27:26.108 --> 00:27:27.481\n&gt;&gt; Woohoo, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I know it's great, isn't it?\n\n484\n00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:29.178\nSo we will be ready for that.\n\n485\n00:27:29.178 --> 00:27:32.929\nBut at least here you're seeing just\na sample and these are some of the things\n\n486\n00:27:32.929 --> 00:27:35.934\nthat you just have to know,\nvery testable material as well.\n\n487\n00:27:35.934 --> 00:27:41.022\nSo, do not neglect and think that you\ncan get by without knowing where things\n\n488\n00:27:41.022 --> 00:27:46.111\nare located inside of the SharePoint Admin\ncCenter and understanding it for\n\n489\n00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:51.530\nthe users here, both setting it globally\nas well as at the site level too.\n\n490\n00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Ronnie for joining\nus today and taking the time to show us\n\n491\n00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.760\nthe many configurations and\nhow we can break things, and\n\n492\n00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.870\nthen the painstaking effort it\ntakes to go back and fix them.\n\n493\n00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.280\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\ntuning in, but just like he mentioned,\n\n494\n00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.900\nstay tuned because we have more\nPowerPoint headed your way.\n\n495\n00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.010\nFor this show, we'll sign out.\n\n496\n00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.750\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n497\n00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:11.530\n&gt;&gt;

Well thank you again for\n\n18\n00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.650\nhaving me back on the show as we take\na look now at exactly what Mike said.\n\n19\n00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.690\nWe already set everything up, remember\nthat when you start setting up for\n\n20\n00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.420\nexternal users to be able to\naccess your organization,\n\n21\n00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.380\nyou have to let them in\nthrough the front door first.\n\n22\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.540\nAnd that's when we set up the global\nconfiguration to just say, yes,\n\n23\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.390\nwe want to allow people to come in.\n\n24\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.650\nBut even if we do that, we may not want\nto allow them into every single room\n\n25\n00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.810\nin whatever building that we have.\n\n26\n00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.820\nSo inside of, maybe,\neven a business, right?\n\n27\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.410\nWe would normally lock certain doors,\nand then allow for\n\n28\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.620\naccess to other places, too.\n\n29\n00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.230\nWe can do that, as well, in SharePoint.\n\n30\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.720\nBy enabling the idea of course of\nallowing users or actually blocking them\n\n31\n00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.940\nby enabling those same access types\nof privileges on a per-site basis.\n\n32\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.620\nSo the great thing is we\nshow you how to do that.\n\n33\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.270\nNow it comes to the time since we actually\ndid go ahead and say yes we want you or\n\n34\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.310\ncome through the door.\n\n35\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.090\nWe also went ahead and said yes we're\ngonna allow certain users to come in\n\n36\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.720\nto that particular room or that site.\n\n37\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.800\nWell now, we have to just prove\nthat it works when we did this.\n\n38\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.970\nNow I did change a little\nbit of the configurations.\n\n39\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.100\nAnd that's because to be able\nto use a live connection then,\n\n40\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.850\nin the previous episode I\nhad blocked ITPro.TV use,\n\n41\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.360\nand that actually includes by account,\nwhich is really bad,\n\n42\n00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.410\ncuz that's gonna actually be\nthe external user I want to allow in.\n\n43\n00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.780\nSo I did remove that and\nallow the connections to come in, but\n\n44\n00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.010\nthat's what we're gonna end up doing.\n\n45\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.960\nSo first and\n\n46\n00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.640\nforemost then, that's what we wanna show\nyou is we wanna show you of course then,\n\n47\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.120\nfirst allowing access into a particular\nsite, verifying that it can work.\n\n48\n00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.560\nAnd then, once we get that working,\n\n49\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.670\nwe then want to also show you how\nto remove that access as well.\n\n50\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.171\nAnd because of the way that the exam\nobjectives set it out here,\n\n51\n00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:34.397\nnot only do you have to know it in the GUI\nwhich all of us can kind of figure out as\n\n52\n00:02:34.397 --> 00:02:35.480\nrelatively easy.\n\n53\n00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.750\nWhen you can right click on something and\ngo, delete that user.\n\n54\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.110\nOr remove the user.\n\n55\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.380\nThat's pretty good.\n\n56\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.060\nBut PowerShell is a big\npart of the exam too.\n\n57\n00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.960\nSo we need to go into\nPowerShell to do this.\n\n58\n00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.330\nYeah, removing users, obviously,\na very important part as employees change\n\n59\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.060\npositions and no longer need that level\nof access or access to a particular site.\n\n60\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.410\nOr they leave our organization and\n\n61\n00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.660\nwe wanna make sure they can\nno longer get in there.\n\n62\n00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.900\nVery important that we\nknow how to remove users.\n\n63\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.410\nAlso any time we can automate\nsomething by using PowerShell,\n\n64\n00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.300\nit's gonna make our life as\nan administrator a whole lot easier.\n\n65\n00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.960\nSo Ronnie, where do we start?\n\n66\n00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's go ahead and\n\n67\n00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.690\ngive access then to somebody in\none of the sites that we created.\n\n68\n00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.890\nSo let's take a look at\nmy machine as we do this.\n\n69\n00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.420\nSo let's take for an example here it is,\n\n70\n00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.190\nJoey this is the account that\nwe've been using all along, and\n\n71\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.410\nnow that we've got all the access\nto really set up to allow this.\n\n72\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.731\nIf Joey said look I know that\nI want to allow a safe for\n\n73\n00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:34.905\nRonnie to get access into one of my sites,\nwell all I have to do is come over here,\n\n74\n00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:38.020\nand I'm gonna look for\nmy own SharePoint icon.\n\n75\n00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.984\nNow let's make sure that that we remember\nthis, or the end users will remember this,\n\n76\n00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:44.710\nand it's something that\nwe have to make sure of.\n\n77\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.070\nIf I go to OneDrive,\nI can still share this out if I wanted to,\n\n78\n00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.580\nto Mike if I wanted to.\n\n79\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.486\nNow if I do that, that gives him access\nto whatever I put in that particular\n\n80\n00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:55.504\nlocation, which is perfectly fine.\n\n81\n00:03:55.504 --> 00:03:59.560\nBut it really is about all the stuff that\nhe is willing to share out on his own.\n\n82\n00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.930\nYou really don't have to do\nanything with our organization,\n\n83\n00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.300\nit's like his personal\naccount that he sent.\n\n84\n00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.770\nAnything that put in here I wanna\nshare out is perfectly fine.\n\n85\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.050\nI can do so.\n\n86\n00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.263\nBut when we go to SharePoint over here,\nthis is what also is the same\n\n87\n00:04:14.263 --> 00:04:19.770\nthing that we say, look, we're actually\nmaking this for the purpose of sharing.\n\n88\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.260\nSo even though the OneDrive\nallows us to do it.\n\n89\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.970\nIt doesn't allow them access to anybody\nelse that might put things in there.\n\n90\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.150\nBecause nobody else should have\naccess to Mike's OneDrive.\n\n91\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.560\nBut in SharePoint we might have multiple\npeople that have access in there.\n\n92\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.020\nSo that they can share and\ncollaborate on documents and\n\n93\n00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.900\ndifferent files that we have available.\n\n94\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.235\nSo make sure you go to the SharePoint\nfolder itself or I'll say folder.\n\n95\n00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:44.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this is one of the things Mike,\n\n96\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.346\nI've made this an issue\nthe last multiple episodes.\n\n97\n00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:51.670\nEvery time you actually click on a tile,\ninstead of it's flipping the webpage,\n\n98\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.840\nin the same tab,\nit always creates this new tab.\n\n99\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.340\nAnd after a while,\nthere's gonna be six or seven tabs.\n\n100\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.370\nAnd they're all gonna be almost\nidentical when we do this.\n\n101\n00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.710\nSo I don't know why it bothers me,\nbut it does bother me,\n\n102\n00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.160\nwhen stuff like that happens here.\n\n103\n00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.270\nSo let's take, for an example,\nI want to be able to get access to myself,\n\n104\n00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.210\nto Ronnie, or Joey wants to give\naccess to Ronnie to the London site.\n\n105\n00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.250\nWell the good thing is,\nI'm already a member of this London site.\n\n106\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.660\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick on London, and there it is.\n\n107\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.980\nLook at that, that third tab.\n\n108\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna see,\n\n109\n00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.420\nyeah, it really isn't that much different.\n\n110\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.090\nThere's that one, and there's that one.\n\n111\n00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.250\nAnd so now I'm actually inside of London.\n\n112\n00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.268\nAnd right here,\n\n113\n00:05:32.268 --> 00:05:37.285\nyou can see some of the different things\nthat's already been here and available,\n\n114\n00:05:37.285 --> 00:05:42.580\nso some documents, some different ones\nhave been modified at some point.\n\n115\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.502\nAnd if I wanna say, Ronny needs\nto be able to get access to this,\n\n116\n00:05:46.502 --> 00:05:49.100\nI'm in control of this particular site.\n\n117\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.891\nWell you can do that and the great thing\nis it's fairly easy in the upper right\n\n118\n00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:55.330\nhand corner right here,\nlet me see if I can zoom.\n\n119\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.800\nYou can see where it\njust simply says share.\n\n120\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.948\nNow that's pretty easy to do,\nI click on Share and when we do that,\n\n121\n00:06:01.948 --> 00:06:06.097\nit now shows you well some of\nthe people it's already shared with,\n\n122\n00:06:06.097 --> 00:06:08.860\nwell it's already been shared with Lance.\n\n123\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.000\nThen I can invite someone\nto share this with as well.\n\n124\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.520\nSo if I can type in my own\nemail address right now.\n\n125\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.360\n&gt;&gt; That can be challenging sometimes.\n\n126\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.430\n&gt;&gt; Me typing anything is\npretty much a challenge.\n\n127\n00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.695\nSo there it is, so\nthere's my own email address.\n\n128\n00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:29.685\nThis is where in a previous episode\nwhen I blocked out ITPro.TV,\n\n129\n00:06:29.685 --> 00:06:35.355\nwhen I click Share, it said, users in this\ndomain aren't allowed to connect then.\n\n130\n00:06:35.355 --> 00:06:38.445\nSo unless I'm wrong here, and\nhopefully I cleared it out.\n\n131\n00:06:38.445 --> 00:06:39.955\nIf I click Share,\n\n132\n00:06:39.955 --> 00:06:44.240\nit just gives me a confirmation that\nit's outside of my organization.\n\n133\n00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.530\nAnd I also get this box\nthat floats up here.\n\n134\n00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.980\nActually there's an email\nthat's been sent to me, but\n\n135\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.510\nalso it showed a little notification that\nit's been shared with an external user.\n\n136\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.030\nSo I just popped up here just briefly too.\n\n137\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.880\nSo now it's shared out with Ronnie, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.470\nNow, there's a couple of things that's\na little bit scary about this when\n\n139\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.990\nwe do this.\n\n140\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so far when you say Ronnie that\nwas pretty straightforward like you're\n\n141\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.880\nsaying earlier, I click one button,\nsaid share, that's pretty straightforward.\n\n142\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.710\nAnd then all you needed to know\nwas that person's email address\n\n143\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.660\nand you're good to go.\n\n144\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.200\nJust about, that's all you\nreally have to have access to.\n\n145\n00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.920\nNow the funny thing is, if I go back up\nhere to Share, and then I select shared\n\n146\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.200\nwith, you're gonna see something and it's\ngonna kind of frighten you a little bit.\n\n147\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.040\nNotice it says Joey and Lance, and\nwhat are we normally looking for\n\n148\n00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.790\nhere too, since I shared it out, Mike?\n\n149\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.315\n&gt;&gt; I don't see Ronnie and IT Pro.TV.\n\n150\n00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:39.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't see that.\n\n151\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.840\nAnd so at the very beginning,\nthe first time you do this,\n\n152\n00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.430\nyou're like something's wrong.\n\n153\n00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.500\nWell, there has to be a connection made\nfirst before he actually shows up.\n\n154\n00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.310\nSo don't let that frighten you.\n\n155\n00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.080\nI know because I've done this\na couple of different times and\n\n156\n00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.170\nI was like, yeah I forgot.\n\n157\n00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.857\nI have to actually connect in,\nbut I always like to verify.\n\n158\n00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:02.373\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah that's a great point, cuz\nmost administrators are gonna go double\n\n159\n00:08:02.373 --> 00:08:04.890\ncheck and let me make sure\nRonnie shows up on the list, and\n\n160\n00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.796\nwhen you don't I'm gonna troubleshoot.\n\n161\n00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:09.159\nI'm gonna try to share it again,\nwhen in fact,\n\n162\n00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:13.310\nit just needs Ronnie to make that initial\nconnection before it shows up on the list.\n\n163\n00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.179\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's one of the key things.\n\n164\n00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:18.489\nJust, I know it did kind of I'm like,\nI know I shared this.\n\n165\n00:08:18.489 --> 00:08:20.201\nAnd then all of the sudden,\nI kept hitting share.\n\n166\n00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:23.354\nI kept typing in my email address, and\nit was six or seven of these invitations.\n\n167\n00:08:23.354 --> 00:08:26.123\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you hate to say this, but\n\n168\n00:08:26.123 --> 00:08:29.033\nthey are time sensitive\nto a point as well.\n\n169\n00:08:29.033 --> 00:08:33.669\nSo if you've if you kind of did like I\ndid, and all of a sudden you choose one,\n\n170\n00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:38.599\nit may not let you in saying, this has\nbeen superseded by another whatever,\n\n171\n00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:42.040\nor it might say,\nyour link has expired at this point.\n\n172\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.039\nSo whatever you get,\nit gets a weird message here.\n\n173\n00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.117\nSo now, what has to happen?\n\n174\n00:08:46.117 --> 00:08:50.617\nWell the great thing is, now that it's\nshared out I can then go over to my\n\n175\n00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:53.702\nemail box here, and\nI'm not showing anything.\n\n176\n00:08:53.702 --> 00:08:56.610\nI got a Twitter message from Mike.\n\n177\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.347\n&gt;&gt; I had to Tweet about your fantastic\nshow, Ronnie, wanted everybody to know.\n\n178\n00:09:00.347 --> 00:09:03.334\n&gt;&gt; So here is the link then, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:07.416\nSo the great thing is,\nnow the end user's kind of surprised.\n\n180\n00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:12.059\nIf the end user is not informed about what\nis gonna happen when they're done this,\n\n181\n00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:13.689\nit should be fairly simple.\n\n182\n00:09:13.689 --> 00:09:19.296\nHopefully, Joey has actually either\ncalled or sent me an email saying hey,\n\n183\n00:09:19.296 --> 00:09:24.475\nI'm gonna share my site to you,\nI'll be expecting the email, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:29.037\nYou're might be going,\nit just says hello, go to London and\n\n185\n00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:32.802\nthen I take a look,\na no reply share point online.\n\n186\n00:09:32.802 --> 00:09:36.656\nIf I don't expect this, in today's world\nI'm expecting that this might be some type\n\n187\n00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:38.007\nof phishing attack, right?\n\n188\n00:09:38.007 --> 00:09:42.242\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say and all of our viewers\nout there know if they weren't expecting\n\n189\n00:09:42.242 --> 00:09:44.993\nthis invite,\nthey better not click on that link.\n\n190\n00:09:44.993 --> 00:09:48.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The only saving grace\nhere right in terms of that is\n\n191\n00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.440\nwhen you take a look hopefully this\nemail address looks familiar to you, and\n\n192\n00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.649\nif you're not sure about clicking on it,\nhold off contact Joey.\n\n193\n00:09:57.649 --> 00:09:58.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, call Joey.\n\n194\n00:09:58.355 --> 00:10:01.839\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and say hey,\ndid you actually send this to me or not?\n\n195\n00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:03.862\nAnd if he goes no,\ndon't click on that link.\n\n196\n00:10:03.862 --> 00:10:04.731\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n197\n00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:08.402\n&gt;&gt; And if he says, yes,\nthen go ahead and say, all right.\n\n198\n00:10:08.402 --> 00:10:13.154\nNow, this is where we\nsimply click on London.\n\n199\n00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:16.445\nAnd now, notice it automatically\nbrings me to this page.\n\n200\n00:10:16.445 --> 00:10:18.857\nSo even though I'm\noutside the organization,\n\n201\n00:10:18.857 --> 00:10:21.339\nI'm signed in my own laptop\nhere as Ronnie Wong.\n\n202\n00:10:21.339 --> 00:10:23.469\nI do have an organizational account.\n\n203\n00:10:23.469 --> 00:10:27.500\nIn other words, I know because we\nactually do use Office 365 here.\n\n204\n00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:32.263\nThen, I can go ahead and\ntype in ITPro.TV, and\n\n205\n00:10:32.263 --> 00:10:37.873\nhere hopefully it's gonna say,\nhey, Work or school.\n\n206\n00:10:37.873 --> 00:10:40.875\nThis is our work account, and\nyou can see our own logo showing up.\n\n207\n00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:42.788\nSo I'm now connected in.\n\n208\n00:10:42.788 --> 00:10:46.298\nThen, I believe I've\nactually saved the password.\n\n209\n00:10:46.298 --> 00:10:47.690\nOf course that will not work.\n\n210\n00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.561\nAll right, so now,\nI have to actually get my password.\n\n211\n00:10:51.561 --> 00:10:56.544\nLet's see, let me do a quick search here,\nfor Office.\n\n212\n00:10:56.544 --> 00:11:00.499\nGreat thing is I can just copy the\npassword without showing that to anybody.\n\n213\n00:11:00.499 --> 00:11:01.107\n&gt;&gt; Damn.\n\n214\n00:11:01.107 --> 00:11:05.547\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then I can sign in.\n\n215\n00:11:05.547 --> 00:11:12.414\nNow, once I'm signed in here,\nlook at that, I'm automatically in and\n\n216\n00:11:12.414 --> 00:11:16.992\nI'm not gonna say, not now,\nand I'm at London.\n\n217\n00:11:16.992 --> 00:11:21.754\nAnd if you take a look,\nthis is not ITProTV's SharePoint,\n\n218\n00:11:21.754 --> 00:11:23.945\nthis is officeprodemoco,\n\n219\n00:11:23.945 --> 00:11:29.393\nwhich is the account that we're using for\nour demonstration here.\n\n220\n00:11:29.393 --> 00:11:35.333\nSo I am in the London site for,\nwell that particular company.\n\n221\n00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:38.126\nSo even though I'm an external user,\nI can do this.\n\n222\n00:11:38.126 --> 00:11:41.971\nI also modified the permissions,\nnot only to allow me read access here,\n\n223\n00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:44.126\nbut also to be able to upload documents.\n\n224\n00:11:44.126 --> 00:11:48.698\nSo if I wanted to verify that,\nI simply click on upload a document, and\n\n225\n00:11:48.698 --> 00:11:53.522\nlet's see it looks like it's taking\nit's sweet time working on it here\n\n226\n00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:54.075\n&gt;&gt; Thinking about it\n\n227\n00:11:54.075 --> 00:11:54.603\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n228\n00:11:54.603 --> 00:11:58.123\nits thinking about it then\nI can choose a file and\n\n229\n00:11:58.123 --> 00:12:03.854\nfrom here inside of my documents,\nI can choose theres a pdf for something.\n\n230\n00:12:03.854 --> 00:12:08.594\nLet’s go ahead and pull that up, and\nwe can add in comments of course but\n\n231\n00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:11.766\nfrom that point go ahead and\nallow it to upload.\n\n232\n00:12:11.766 --> 00:12:15.060\nIt shouldn't take too long,\nand there we go.\n\n233\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.151\nDocument was uploaded a nd\nis checked out to me.\n\n234\n00:12:18.151 --> 00:12:22.842\nSo if I want to, I can say this is\n\n235\n00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:27.904\nthe CCMP route exam objectives.\n\n236\n00:12:27.904 --> 00:12:29.255\nI can check that in.\n\n237\n00:12:29.255 --> 00:12:31.994\nAnd notices it tells it was created by me.\n\n238\n00:12:31.994 --> 00:12:36.389\nNow if I scroll down, oops, I probably\nneed that should go to the documents.\n\n239\n00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:40.160\nSo I click on documents over\nhere on the left hand side.\n\n240\n00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.394\nI can now see where\njust a few seconds ago,\n\n241\n00:12:43.394 --> 00:12:47.845\nit was actually modified by me and\nalso made by me as well.\n\n242\n00:12:47.845 --> 00:12:49.648\nNow I had actually done\nthis a little bit earlier.\n\n243\n00:12:49.648 --> 00:12:53.130\nSo you're actually seeing one from a\nremnant a little bit earlier as well, but\n\n244\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.049\nthe very fact is, you can actually see it.\n\n245\n00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:56.527\nIt's actually right there.\n\n246\n00:12:56.527 --> 00:12:59.861\nSo, hopefully Mike,\ndo you think I've now successfully\n\n247\n00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:03.043\nconnected as an external\nuser into the SharePoint?\n\n248\n00:13:03.043 --> 00:13:04.295\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you're in there.\n\n249\n00:13:04.295 --> 00:13:06.749\nYou can browse around\nthat particular site.\n\n250\n00:13:06.749 --> 00:13:09.983\nYou can even upload content because\nyou were given that permission.\n\n251\n00:13:09.983 --> 00:13:11.702\nWhat about navigating to\nthe rest of the site?\n\n252\n00:13:11.702 --> 00:13:14.121\nCuz I did notice when you\nclicked on that link, or\n\n253\n00:13:14.121 --> 00:13:16.605\nwhen you're connected to\nthis share point site.\n\n254\n00:13:16.605 --> 00:13:17.228\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n255\n00:13:17.228 --> 00:13:19.508\n&gt;&gt; It didn't take you\nto like the main page.\n\n256\n00:13:19.508 --> 00:13:21.253\nIt took you specifically to London,\n\n257\n00:13:21.253 --> 00:13:24.643\nbecause that's where Joey decided\nhe wanted to share access with you.\n\n258\n00:13:24.643 --> 00:13:28.335\nSo could you jump over to say NYC or\nany other part right now?\n\n259\n00:13:28.335 --> 00:13:29.431\n&gt;&gt; Not that I know of.\n\n260\n00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:32.595\nSo in other words, if somebody\nactually goes of course you can,\n\n261\n00:13:32.595 --> 00:13:33.777\njust go ahead and, no.\n\n262\n00:13:33.777 --> 00:13:35.075\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And at this point,\n\n263\n00:13:35.075 --> 00:13:37.879\nhopefully the share is\nlimiting the only to London,\n\n264\n00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:40.376\nand why we do it on that\nper site basis instead.\n\n265\n00:13:40.376 --> 00:13:43.842\n&gt;&gt; Which is great, so now you know that\nyou can give somebody outside your\n\n266\n00:13:43.842 --> 00:13:47.841\norganization access to a particular site\nthat was designed for external users,\n\n267\n00:13:47.841 --> 00:13:51.286\npublicly available information,\ncollaboration, what have you.\n\n268\n00:13:51.286 --> 00:13:54.365\nAnd you don't have to to worry about\nthem getting into places that they\n\n269\n00:13:54.365 --> 00:13:56.768\nshouldn't be,\nlike company specific information,\n\n270\n00:13:56.768 --> 00:13:58.871\nintellectual property\nthat might be up there.\n\n271\n00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:03.593\nThings like that, so it really does a good\njob of making it very easy to limit what\n\n272\n00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.719\nthat user's actually accessing.\n\n273\n00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:09.878\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it really is a big part\nof what we have to be able to do.\n\n274\n00:14:09.878 --> 00:14:13.657\nJust like what Mike was saying\nat the beginning of the episode,\n\n275\n00:14:13.657 --> 00:14:15.594\nsometimes users end up moving.\n\n276\n00:14:15.594 --> 00:14:19.426\nLet's say that for example,\nthey switch teams.\n\n277\n00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:22.838\nNo longer are they actually in London,\nbut now they're in New York City.\n\n278\n00:14:22.838 --> 00:14:25.302\nThey might not need access\nto London anymore awhile so\n\n279\n00:14:25.302 --> 00:14:26.568\nI will have to remove them.\n\n280\n00:14:26.568 --> 00:14:30.040\nAnd then limit their access here or\nremove it completely, and\n\n281\n00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.668\nthen add them into another site as well,\nand we need to actually see that part too.\n\n282\n00:14:34.668 --> 00:14:36.185\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that I was gonna say,\nthat would be my next question.\n\n283\n00:14:36.185 --> 00:14:40.332\nNow let's see we've given somebody\naccess and now everything works.\n\n284\n00:14:40.332 --> 00:14:41.168\nHow do we get rid of them?\n\n285\n00:14:41.168 --> 00:14:44.571\nI know you said we can do it in\nthe GUI as well as with PowerShell.\n\n286\n00:14:44.571 --> 00:14:46.379\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nI'm not gonna worry about the GUI part,\n\n287\n00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:47.706\nI'm gonna leave you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n288\n00:14:47.706 --> 00:14:49.966\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna leave you to discover exactly\n\n289\n00:14:49.966 --> 00:14:51.634\nhow challenging that one is.\n\n290\n00:14:51.634 --> 00:14:55.595\nIt's not very challenging,\nbut on the exam though,\n\n291\n00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:58.418\nit is about using the PowerShell too.\n\n292\n00:14:58.418 --> 00:15:02.436\nAnd let me emphasize this point again and\nthis was something that I've said\n\n293\n00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:05.200\nin a couple of other episodes or\nat least one other.\n\n294\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.899\nAnd I learned this from Brian Svidergol,\none of our Exchange experts who actually\n\n295\n00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:13.457\nwrites books and says,\nlook this is how they do it on the exam.\n\n296\n00:15:13.457 --> 00:15:17.892\nThey said, the GUI interface, they\nexpect you to be able to learn but for\n\n297\n00:15:17.892 --> 00:15:23.144\nconsistency sake, it's the syntax of the\nPowerShell that they can easily grade on.\n\n298\n00:15:23.144 --> 00:15:28.089\nSo that's why PowerShells, on the exams\nat least, are being pushed harder because\n\n299\n00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:32.564\nthere's no like, you, yes, I could\nsee how you could get to it that way.\n\n300\n00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:35.502\nThey can just judge the syntax whether or\nnot you know the command or not.\n\n301\n00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:36.384\n&gt;&gt; It's either right or wrong.\n\n302\n00:15:36.384 --> 00:15:38.869\n&gt;&gt; It's either right or wrong and\nthat's pretty much about it.\n\n303\n00:15:38.869 --> 00:15:41.708\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie,\nwell I know that every Windows operating\n\n304\n00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:44.505\nsystem nowadays comes with\nPowerShell already installed.\n\n305\n00:15:44.505 --> 00:15:45.530\nSo I don't have to do anything.\n\n306\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.325\nI can just open up PowerShell and\nget to work, right?\n\n307\n00:15:48.325 --> 00:15:50.533\n&gt;&gt; I would love to say yes, okay?\n\n308\n00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:53.893\nThat would be the absolute truth,\nbut we would be mistaken.\n\n309\n00:15:53.893 --> 00:15:57.999\nYou of course, have to connect to\nthe SharePoint online to do so.\n\n310\n00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:01.870\nSo what we're gonna do now is make\nsure that we have everything that we\n\n311\n00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:02.554\nneed to do.\n\n312\n00:16:02.554 --> 00:16:04.924\nNow before you do that,\nyou can go online and\n\n313\n00:16:04.924 --> 00:16:07.177\nyou can download the SharePoint module.\n\n314\n00:16:07.177 --> 00:16:10.840\nThat you have to get installed on your\ncomputer and what you do as simple again,\n\n315\n00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.430\ndownload it, install, follow instructions,\nyou're up and you're ready to go.\n\n316\n00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.240\nBut, to be able to do that, and\n\n317\n00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.285\nthen connect online, yo have to be\nwilling to add in a little bit more.\n\n318\n00:16:21.285 --> 00:16:21.985\nAnd we're gonna show you\n\n319\n00:16:21.985 --> 00:16:24.955\nthe whole process of connecting\nto SharePoint Online as well.\n\n320\n00:16:24.955 --> 00:16:25.765\nIt's a great reminder,\n\n321\n00:16:25.765 --> 00:16:28.435\neven though it's not specifically\npart of the exam objectives.\n\n322\n00:16:28.435 --> 00:16:32.373\nRemoving though is, but we wanna make sure\nthat you have the whole thing in mind and\n\n323\n00:16:32.373 --> 00:16:33.014\nready to go.\n\n324\n00:16:33.014 --> 00:16:36.189\nSo, let's take a look at my computer here,\nand there we are,\n\n325\n00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:40.185\nI've just opened up the regular PowerShell\nin an administrative mode here.\n\n326\n00:16:40.185 --> 00:16:42.910\nIf you're gonna connect into\nSharePoint Online though,\n\n327\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:47.310\nyou have to be part of the administrator\ngroup that allows for this access.\n\n328\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:52.600\nYou can't just be, okay I'm part of,\nI'm a member of this site,\n\n329\n00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.640\nand I can go here and connect into\nSharePoint administration console.\n\n330\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.260\nIt's not gonna let you do that.\n\n331\n00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.440\nSo, let's go ahead and begin.\n\n332\n00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.420\nWe wanna start with set\nthe ExecutionPolicy, I'm gonna tell it,\n\n333\n00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.380\nwe wanna do it remotely,\nand now it's gonna say hey,\n\n334\n00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.290\nare you sure you want to do\nthis to protect everything?\n\n335\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.670\nYes, I want this to run\non SharePoint Online,\n\n336\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.930\nis what essentially I'm saying, right?\n\n337\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.170\nNow, once we get to that point,\n\n338\n00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.358\nI now need to set up the credentials\nthat we're going to use to connect in.\n\n339\n00:17:23.358 --> 00:17:27.980\nSo, I'm gonnao create a, well I guess\na variable is what we call it here.\n\n340\n00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.370\nI know the proper term\nMike might actually know.\n\n341\n00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.756\n&gt;&gt; I like it, very good works.\n\n342\n00:17:31.756 --> 00:17:35.670\n&gt;&gt; Then it's gonna bring up this and\nsay hey, Ronnie you have to type it now.\n\n343\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:40.770\nYou do need to be careful here because,\nit will accept typos.\n\n344\n00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.940\nWe're not really sending any information.\n\n345\n00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.350\nI'm not really authenticating\nagainst anything.\n\n346\n00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:48.450\nI'm just saying, here's what you're\ngonna put inside of that variable,\n\n347\n00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.280\nis what we're actually saying here.\n\n348\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.280\nSo, you also have to do it\nin this format too, okay?\n\n349\n00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.310\nIt had to be in that\nemail format to do this.\n\n350\n00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.790\nIf you're like me, and you're only coming,\nlike you're not cloud based,\n\n351\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.590\nand you're coming from\nthe old Windows domain.\n\n352\n00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.877\nAnd you always go, okay,\nlet's do the domain slash.\n\n353\n00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:08.740\n&gt;&gt; The Pre-Windows 2000 method,\n\n354\n00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.885\nbut we really need to use\nthe user principal name.\n\n355\n00:18:10.885 --> 00:18:14.855\nName, which is gonna be username@ and\nthen domain name.\n\n356\n00:18:14.855 --> 00:18:18.125\n&gt;&gt; And it now depends on my\ntyping ability which, again,\n\n357\n00:18:18.125 --> 00:18:21.670\nI told you is always a 50/50\nchance here to get this.\n\n358\n00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.815\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My money's on you, Ronnie.\n\n359\n00:18:22.815 --> 00:18:25.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\nit better not be, on this one.\n\n360\n00:18:27.445 --> 00:18:29.785\n&gt;&gt; That is a thing that you do\nneed to be careful with because,\n\n361\n00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:31.525\nit's not going to show you, obviously.\n\n362\n00:18:31.525 --> 00:18:34.230\nIt's not actually sending\nthese credentials anywhere,\n\n363\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.800\nit's just storing them in that variable,\nso\n\n364\n00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.880\nyou can make a typo here and keep on\ntrucking, and then things don't work.\n\n365\n00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.199\nAnd don't forget, go back and\ncheck that, easy to make a typo,\n\n366\n00:18:43.199 --> 00:18:45.294\nand it wouldn't tell you at this point.\n\n367\n00:18:45.294 --> 00:18:48.690\n&gt;&gt; Until you actually demand that\nparticular credential, right.\n\n368\n00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.160\nUntil it says,\nplease present the credentials.\n\n369\n00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.963\nAnd then you just have to go back and\nyou'll simply re-run that command again,\n\n370\n00:18:54.963 --> 00:18:58.763\nput in the right credentials but, if\nanything, if right now more than likely if\n\n371\n00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:01.568\nI've typed anything wrong\nit's probably the password.\n\n372\n00:19:01.568 --> 00:19:05.223\nBecause, it's a long password and\nI didn't create it, so\n\n373\n00:19:05.223 --> 00:19:09.380\nthe chances of me remembering\nit are relatively slim at times.\n\n374\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.660\nNow, once we've got it this far and we've\nprovided our credentials and ready to go.\n\n375\n00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:17.580\nWe cannot import in from\nMicrosoft online here.\n\n376\n00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.320\nSo, a module as well, okay?\n\n377\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.459\nSo, this module is\ncalled Microsoft.online.\n\n378\n00:19:25.459 --> 00:19:30.500\nAnd from that point, I can use my tab\nfill, and I do think that tab fill for\n\n379\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.670\nthis, cuz, if I write dash, they have\nto type in all of this and remember it.\n\n380\n00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:40.170\nThen I need to tell it disable,\nname checking,\n\n381\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.500\nand I simply started typing\nthen I use the tab fill again.\n\n382\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.577\nSo, here is the first command, that now\nsays let's import this module so that we\n\n383\n00:19:48.577 --> 00:19:53.821\ncan now use these commands where we are,\nand now I need to connect into SharePoint.\n\n384\n00:19:53.821 --> 00:20:00.820\nSo, there is connect-SPOservice,\nmake sure I'm typing it in right.\n\n385\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:06.610\nAnd there's a long URL that\nwe have to type in here, and\n\n386\n00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.810\nthis is actually gonna be the site\nthat we're connecting to.\n\n387\n00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:13.253\nSo, for us this is gonna be\n\n388\n00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:20.925\nofficeprodemoco.onmicrosoft .com.\n\n389\n00:20:20.925 --> 00:20:24.742\nWait, actually, .microsoft-admin.\n\n390\n00:20:24.742 --> 00:20:27.770\nAlways forget the dash admin,\nis what I forget here.\n\n391\n00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:36.007\nAnd then it's not .com,\nit's .sharepoint.com.\n\n392\n00:20:36.007 --> 00:20:40.920\nAnd now, it's gonna ask it for the, or I'm\ngonna ask you for the credentials to use.\n\n393\n00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.090\nAnd provide it here, too,\nif I spell it right.\n\n394\n00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:50.430\nSo, there we go, and now it's saying,\ncould not connect to SharePoint Online.\n\n395\n00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.470\nLet me see what I've actually\ndone incorrectly here.\n\n396\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.830\n&gt;&gt; Might take out the.\n\n397\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.380\n&gt;&gt; On Microsoft, yeah, that was me.\n\n398\n00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.150\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n399\n00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I forgot all about that part,\ncuz I was getting ready to just do the.\n\n400\n00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.090\n&gt;&gt; So, theres the same url that we\nused to connect through the web.\n\n401\n00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:10.020\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, that's just me making\na big ol typo is what I did I just\n\n402\n00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.600\nI deleted the wrong part.\n\n403\n00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:17.590\nNow, it should do lets see here,\nall right so the great thing is that\n\n404\n00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:22.990\nsince I actually took a look at this and\nit was Taylor that actually spotted my.\n\n405\n00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.710\n&gt;&gt; Typo, again,\n\n406\n00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.645\nsee this is where, why they don't allow\nme to type on shows regularly, right.\n\n407\n00:21:27.645 --> 00:21:31.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, it's the CO, I simply missed that.\n\n408\n00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.010\nBut, that was pretty much it.\n\n409\n00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.860\nAt this point or not, I'm gonna blame\nTaylor, no I'm not gonna do that.\n\n410\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.730\nI'll blame myself and\nthat's how she's better.\n\n411\n00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.610\nCuz, it did to me, only flagged me down,\nand if I get it back, and so\n\n412\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.530\nthank you again Taylor for\nhelping us out here.\n\n413\n00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.600\nMy eyes apparently aren't good,\nand Mike's are.\n\n414\n00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.625\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if any better.\n\n415\n00:21:48.625 --> 00:21:50.128\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] yeah, at this point.\n\n416\n00:21:50.128 --> 00:21:54.036\nSo, even though I have it\ntyped out exactly right here,\n\n417\n00:21:54.036 --> 00:21:59.050\nthis is what gets us access to\nconnect in as we are now read, okay.\n\n418\n00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:03.880\nSo, now that I'm fully connected into\nthe SharePoint Online for my site,\n\n419\n00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.120\nit is at this point,\nthat if I want to remove the user,\n\n420\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.360\nI need to be able to provide well,\na couple of things here, okay.\n\n421\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.630\nThe first thing that I need\nto do which is unusual here,\n\n422\n00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.150\nis it allows me to remove it but by email.\n\n423\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:21.630\nSo, I need to get the email address of\nthat external user and I can do that by\n\n424\n00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:28.870\ndoing GetSPOExternal, and I'm just\ntyping in enough letters to allow for\n\n425\n00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:33.720\nthe auto fill,\nthe tab fill to actually this.\n\n426\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.410\nAnd tell it position zero,\n\n427\n00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:41.780\nwhich is kind of the first position,\nand then how many that I'm looking for?\n\n428\n00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.800\nPage size, I'm just gonna tell it,\nto go ahead and\n\n429\n00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.930\njust let's just do all\nthe external users here.\n\n430\n00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.140\nAnd now you can see,\n\n431\n00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.810\nthat instead of me just limiting\nif I did page size on one or two.\n\n432\n00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:56.030\nThat would return me the first or\nthe first two.\n\n433\n00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But, position zero just says,\n\n434\n00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.470\nhey, here's the first\none in that position.\n\n435\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.145\nAnd you'll see is by email and\nit returned to me everything.\n\n436\n00:23:04.145 --> 00:23:07.633\nSo,I can see the e-mail address,\nthere it is right there, and\n\n437\n00:23:07.633 --> 00:23:09.709\nwhen it was actually created as well.\n\n438\n00:23:09.709 --> 00:23:11.857\nWhen you see this and my dates.\n\n439\n00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:12.500\nYeah, that's correct.\n\n440\n00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.230\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to make sure.\n\n441\n00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.300\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why, four-fourteen\nthat seem was like, is that right?\n\n442\n00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.120\nBut, yeah it's actually right for us.\n\n443\n00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.500\nSo, here we go, everything is now ready.\n\n444\n00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.320\nSo, now that I have that e-mail\naddress to remove the external user\n\n445\n00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.880\nI need to create another thing too.\n\n446\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.530\nSo, now that I have this here, I need\nto go ahead and do another variable.\n\n447\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:40.266\nAnd we're just gonna call this\none external user, or $extuser.\n\n448\n00:23:40.266 --> 00:23:45.674\nThen I'm gonna tell it,\nI need it to get the expo\n\n449\n00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:52.220\nExternalUser, Filter this\nby that email address,\n\n450\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:57.200\nand this has to be exact to\ndo what we need to do here.\n\n451\n00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.813\nNow, that's just creating that variable\nfor me, so that now I can remove it.\n\n452\n00:24:01.813 --> 00:24:07.450\nAnd this is where we\nactually want to remove SPO.\n\n453\n00:24:10.264 --> 00:24:13.150\nI mean, doesn't this flow off the tongue?\n\n454\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:13.979\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n455\n00:24:13.979 --> 00:24:16.741\n&gt;&gt; Isn't this a kind of neat and\neasy to actually be able to type in?\n\n456\n00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.310\n&gt;&gt; But you can start to see where\n\n457\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.700\nusing PowerShell I might be\nable to script this out, right?\n\n458\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.520\nWe're creating some variables.\n\n459\n00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.570\nAnd then maybe later.\n\n460\n00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:29.140\nIf this is something I have to do\nregularly, maybe I can call the script,\n\n461\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.180\nplug in a couple of values for\n\n462\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.470\nthe variables and run it, we're gonna have\nto type these commands every single time.\n\n463\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.560\nGreat thing about PowerShell.\n\n464\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at least that's what we hope.\n\n465\n00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.140\nThat way,\nwe don't have to type this many times.\n\n466\n00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.830\nIf you're with me,\nthen your typing is gonna be many times.\n\n467\n00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:41.449\nSo let's just face it, Mike.\n\n468\n00:24:41.449 --> 00:24:43.458\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much the way\n\n469\n00:24:43.458 --> 00:24:45.180\nit's gonna be, okay?\n\n470\n00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.290\nNow it's gonna ask me, hey, are you sure?\n\n471\n00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:50.470\nDo I really want to\nremove this external user\n\n472\n00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.990\nbased on what I actually\nprovided it right here?\n\n473\n00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:58.060\nWell, I have to actually select one of\nthese and I'm simply gonna say, yes.\n\n474\n00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.160\nSo, just do the Y.\n\n475\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.090\nAnd now it tells me it successfully\nremoved the following external users.\n\n476\n00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.854\nAnd that is what we want here.\n\n477\n00:25:06.854 --> 00:25:08.238\n&gt;&gt; So [CROSSTALK] gives you the ID and\n\n478\n00:25:08.238 --> 00:25:11.015\nyou're supposed to be able to,\nyeah that's Ronnie, yeah.\n\n479\n00:25:11.015 --> 00:25:14.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hopefully that's actually\nRonnie to be able to do this.\n\n480\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:19.571\nSo now if I wanted to,\nI kind of know cuz it actually validated,\n\n481\n00:25:19.571 --> 00:25:23.329\nit says hey it remove this\nparticular user here and\n\n482\n00:25:23.329 --> 00:25:26.917\nyou can see on that unique\nID that it matches up.\n\n483\n00:25:26.917 --> 00:25:31.390\nSo I know that it is done successfully at\nthis point and that we are ready to go.\n\n484\n00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.850\nBut the problem is even though\nit's actually done at this point,\n\n485\n00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.400\nthere are a couple of\ndifferent things here.\n\n486\n00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.570\nIt doesn't actually remove\nit from the list yet.\n\n487\n00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:44.490\nSo even though I've removed access,\nit still may appear in certain places.\n\n488\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.280\nSo now we have to go back in.\n\n489\n00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.992\nAnd now the second part of truly removing\neverything is us actually coming up\n\n490\n00:25:50.992 --> 00:25:53.580\nhere and getting some more information.\n\n491\n00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:59.712\nSo I'm going to type in\nset SPOUser this time.\n\n492\n00:25:59.712 --> 00:26:02.243\nAnd this is actually gonna be different.\n\n493\n00:26:02.243 --> 00:26:06.965\nDo pay attention here one\nwas the XPO external user,\n\n494\n00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:10.640\nnotice that this one is SPOUser, okay?\n\n495\n00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.040\nAnd that is at the per site level.\n\n496\n00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.090\nWhereas, this one is saying hey,\nlet's kind of block him for\n\n497\n00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:18.740\nright now on the external user part, but\n\n498\n00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.930\nnow at the per site level,\nwe also have to be able to do this.\n\n499\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:24.358\nSo now I simply type in the site.\n\n500\n00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:35.075\nOfficeprodemoco.sharpoint.com/sites.\n\n501\n00:26:35.075 --> 00:26:38.639\nOops, let me zoom out so I can see that.\n\n502\n00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:40.601\n/1 which is the one that I want.\n\n503\n00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:43.780\nAnd now I need a login name.\n\n504\n00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:50.880\nNow, this login name is not exactly\nthe same as the display name, okay?\n\n505\n00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.510\nYou can go into the GUI interface and\nactually find out\n\n506\n00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:01.110\nwhat the login name is, which is a little\nbit unusual here, but you can do it.\n\n507\n00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.590\nSo I've already gone ahead and\ndone that for us.\n\n508\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:08.233\nLogin name and this is gonna be\n\n509\n00:27:08.233 --> 00:27:13.445\nronnie_itpro.tv#ext here.\n\n510\n00:27:13.445 --> 00:27:21.599\nAnd that's what's also what's going\nto be tagged at officeprodemoco,\n\n511\n00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:26.868\nwow this one is long onMicrosoft.com,\nokay.\n\n512\n00:27:26.868 --> 00:27:31.690\nSo this one now removed that\nexternal user from the site as well.\n\n513\n00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:35.380\nIf I've typed it in correctly, if I\nhaven't it will spew out red things at me,\n\n514\n00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.550\nso-\n&gt;&gt; I think you might've missed\n\n515\n00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.260\nthe co again.\n\n516\n00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:37.987\n&gt;&gt; Did I?\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n517\n00:27:37.987 --> 00:27:38.595\n&gt;&gt; Are you sure?\n\n518\n00:27:38.595 --> 00:27:42.860\nNo, it's actually in there,\nso let me see, what did I do?\n\n519\n00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.680\n&gt;&gt; In the logon name I\nthink you missed co.\n\n520\n00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.870\n&gt;&gt; Did I?\n&gt;&gt; Can you go full-screen there?\n\n521\n00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.040\n&gt;&gt; Let me see, I did you were right.\n\n522\n00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.291\n&gt;&gt; It's cuz it was scrolling right\nas you were typing it right there\n\n523\n00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:56.400\n&gt;&gt; That is correct, let's try it now.\n\n524\n00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.216\nAll right, there we go finally, so\n\n525\n00:27:58.216 --> 00:28:02.450\nthank you Mike eye sight is way better\nthan mine so that's actually good.\n\n526\n00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.960\nSo now you can see there it is,\nsee the display name?\n\n527\n00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.530\nIf I were have gotten that wrong it\nwould be spit out to me all day long.\n\n528\n00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:14.437\nBut because I went in back into the GUI\nand you can, I don't remember exactly\n\n529\n00:28:14.437 --> 00:28:19.346\nwhere that is right now or I'd show\nyou but you can actually see here this\n\n530\n00:28:19.346 --> 00:28:24.358\nis the actual entire login name I would\nnever remember that in the day's age.\n\n531\n00:28:24.358 --> 00:28:26.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Would you do some like this here.\n\n532\n00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.080\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie, so\nthere's the user we want to remove.\n\n533\n00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.550\nWhat is the command to actually remove it?\n\n534\n00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.278\nNow that we've actually gotten the user\nname itself and that login name,\n\n535\n00:28:35.278 --> 00:28:41.330\nthe command is actually almost identical\nexcept instead of get the user SPO and\n\n536\n00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.800\nI simply hit the upper rows so\nI can use this history to help us out.\n\n537\n00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.790\nIt is now to remove the user instead.\n\n538\n00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.710\nI'm gonna make sure that\nI'm telling you correctly.\n\n539\n00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:56.210\nYeah, there we go, is remove the user.\n\n540\n00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.420\nAnd I'm verifying this is\neverything else that I need.\n\n541\n00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.500\nlogin name.\n\n542\n00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.400\nYep, so that should actually work.\n\n543\n00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.740\nSo as long as I don't have to type\nin this long thing again right here,\n\n544\n00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:10.420\nI'm just trying to make sure, and the only\nthing I did was change the word get to\n\n545\n00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:16.170\nremove, then I should be able to\nrun this entire thing right here,\n\n546\n00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.510\nand now that should actually\nbe removed as well, okay.\n\n547\n00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:28.097\nNow once we do this, we wanna do the get\nSPOUser, And now it's gonna ask me for\n\n548\n00:29:28.097 --> 00:29:32.696\nthat site again, I'm just having to\ntype this thing over and over again and\n\n549\n00:29:32.696 --> 00:29:37.340\nwhat are the chances that I am actually\ngoing to do this correctly again.\n\n550\n00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.970\n&gt;&gt; I think they're good Ronnie.\n\n551\n00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.680\n&gt;&gt; Sites, see I almost did it right there.\n\n552\n00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.050\nSo Office, see I already missed it.\n\n553\n00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:50.810\nI called it Office Pro Democo, because\nwe should have a longer domain name.\n\n554\n00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:51.900\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; If at all possible,\n\n555\n00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.710\nwe should have a long one.\n\n556\n00:29:54.970 --> 00:30:00.260\nAnd here in a moment, notice now that what\nyou end up seeing is that Ronald Wong or\n\n557\n00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.050\nRonnie is actually no longer in here.\n\n558\n00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.450\nSo that validates for us at the very end,\nthat that external user\n\n559\n00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:11.700\nis not only removed from accessing\nthe collection anymore, but\n\n560\n00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.490\nat the same time he's\nnot even gonna show up.\n\n561\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.350\nSo even if there was some remnant\nof his name just left out there,\n\n562\n00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.330\neven though he don't have any\naccess this actually removes him\n\n563\n00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:24.180\ninstead of people going why is Ronnie\nstill, his name is still listed there.\n\n564\n00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.550\nThis should fix it all and\n\n565\n00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:29.430\nnow we have completely removed Ronnie\nfrom being an external user too.\n\n566\n00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.920\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic stuff, Ronnie.\n\n567\n00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:35.720\nReally good look at how we can, over\nthe course of the past three episodes,\n\n568\n00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.810\nset up that external access to allow\nusers outside of our organization\n\n569\n00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.450\nto access certain content,\nand then test it out.\n\n570\n00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:46.185\nWe saw how through the GUI, we got, using\nthe email address of that external user,\n\n571\n00:30:46.185 --> 00:30:50.680\nallow them access and\ncontrol what they had access to and\n\n572\n00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.660\nthen just as important there towards\nthe end, had to remove somebody's access.\n\n573\n00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.100\nOnce they no longer need that, right?\n\n574\n00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.710\nThat's a very important part of\nour responsibilities as well.\n\n575\n00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.997\nGot a lots of industry and\ngovernmental regulations I believe\n\n576\n00:31:02.997 --> 00:31:06.230\nwere user account that's no\nlonger needed sitting around.\n\n577\n00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:13.500\nYou can be facing some challenges we'll\njust say, fines typically monetary issues.\n\n578\n00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.790\nBut great stuff Ronnie,\ngreat explanations.\n\n579\n00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:19.530\nGreat demonstrations out\nthere on how to give and\n\n580\n00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.430\nremove access to external\nusers to our SharePoint sites.\n\n581\n00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.690\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n582\n00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.100\nWe hope everyone out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n583\n00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.950\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n584\n00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:29.780\n&gt;&gt;

IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.120\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.310\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n6\n00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.350\ntoday we're going to be doing our\nenabling Office 365 services.\n\n7\n00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.970\nIn this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.220\nwe're going to be focusing in on creating\nsite collections within SharePoint.\n\n9\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.260\nHere to show us how to do that is Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.070\nWelcome back, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.240\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you again for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n12\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.360\nas we continue on learning\nabout more of these services.\n\n13\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.620\nOf course, everybody loves SharePoint,\nand I've said this before,\n\n14\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.460\nit's facetious to a point.\n\n15\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.330\nIt's a big product, everything in Office\n365 somehow loops back through SharePoint.\n\n16\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.910\nEven if you don't like it,\n\n17\n00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.440\nor even if you kind of mock it\na little bit, it's a big part of it.\n\n18\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.490\nEssentially, it's the main\nhydra tentacle that reaches\n\n19\n00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.130\nalmost every single other\nproduct that we have.\n\n20\n00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.190\nSo, as much as we don't want\nto deal with it at times,\n\n21\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.710\nbecause I really don't want to deal\nwith it, but the very fact is that we\n\n22\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.230\nhave to learn how if we're going\nto be administering Office 365.\n\n23\n00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.710\nOne of those things is that we\nhave to of course be able to\n\n24\n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.920\nis the idea of creating what\nwe call a site collection.\n\n25\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.220\nNow, when we start talking about a site\ncollection, this is essentially a website,\n\n26\n00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.040\nand that's the easiest way I know\nhow to make the analogy to it.\n\n27\n00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.670\nThis is a website so\nthat people can access the documents and\n\n28\n00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.700\nthe files that they need to get access to,\nbut without actually making it\n\n29\n00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.310\nkind of an open-door policy\nto get access to everything.\n\n30\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.330\n&gt;&gt; Very good, so we can control what\nthey're allowed to access, then?\n\n31\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then that way,\nit just makes it easier, right?\n\n32\n00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.620\nIt allows you to manage Mike is asking for\nthis ability to do this with\n\n33\n00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.360\nthe company that he's working with but\nright now we only have our central share.\n\n34\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.301\nWell, what do we actually need to do?\n\n35\n00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:53.184\nWell, I wanna be able to allow\nhim to have that access,\n\n36\n00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:57.134\nbe able to share what he wants to but,\nI don't wanna give that other company\n\n37\n00:01:57.134 --> 00:01:59.599\naccess to everything\nelse that's out there.\n\n38\n00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.160\nSo, we create, of course, well different\nsites to help us to limit that nature,\n\n39\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.700\nas well.\n\n40\n00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.790\nOnce you get your Office 365 subscription\n\n41\n00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.070\nthis is kinda built into the background\nfor you at the very beginning.\n\n42\n00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.730\nSo, let me show you what\nI'm talking about and\n\n43\n00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.790\nthen we'll go into creating a site here.\n\n44\n00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.170\nSo, once we get here and, let's take for\n\n45\n00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.550\nan example that we know that we're\ngonna start using SharePoint.\n\n46\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.050\nInitial reaction of course is simply\nto click here in SharePoint and\n\n47\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.930\nwe're ready to go.\n\n48\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.840\nBut that only gives you\nJoey's perspective,\n\n49\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.580\nthe way that he sees\nthe usage of SharePoint.\n\n50\n00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.620\nBut it means we have to go into\nthe Admin Center to do this.\n\n51\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.080\nAnd that's not right here.\n\n52\n00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.920\nWe can come down here to\nthe tile where it says Admin.\n\n53\n00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.700\nAnd once we select that.\n\n54\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.450\nNow it's gonna ask of course,\nask me to try and log in.\n\n55\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.366\nApparently I logged out which is strange\nsince I clicked on the link isn't it?\n\n56\n00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:52.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah it is.\n\n57\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.340\nLet's reverify though,\nalways good to verify.\n\n58\n00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.720\n&gt;&gt; So apparently that first link and\n\n59\n00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.700\nthen my typing ability\n&gt;&gt; That is still the biggest challenge on\n\n60\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.325\nevery show that I do\nis my ability to type.\n\n61\n00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:07.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n62\n00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.010\nNow I'm getting ridiculous here.\n\n63\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.505\nOne more time and then I'm just\ngonna let Mike try to type it in.\n\n64\n00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:17.219\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; let's see if I can actually do\n\n65\n00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:22.260\nthis Here we go.\n\n66\n00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.690\nSo now, let me get rid of this tab.\n\n67\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.390\nAnd this is one of the things that,\n\n68\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.100\napparently those tabs\nafter a while time out.\n\n69\n00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.370\nSo when I clicked on that link it says,\nyeah that was from a last session but\n\n70\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.205\n&gt;&gt; Now you need a new one.\n\n71\n00:03:34.205 --> 00:03:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n72\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.340\n&gt;&gt; So having those extra tabs there,\na little bit more annoying for me.\n\n73\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.320\nI'm sure Mike said, suggests like,\nwhy don't you go and\n\n74\n00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.160\nsee if there's other settings.\n\n75\n00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.045\nWell I just want to show you some of\nthe frustrations at the very beginning.\n\n76\n00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:44.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n77\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.870\nbuilds character in your\nadministrative ability.\n\n78\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n79\n00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.330\n&gt;&gt; You have to work through those.\n\n80\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.830\nNo it doesn't.\n\n81\n00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.630\nI'm just lazy.\n\n82\n00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.561\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n83\n00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:52.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n84\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.260\nnow that I'm in the Admin Center I\nneed to go to the SharePoint Admin.\n\n85\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.580\nAnd the way we do that is over\nhere on the left-hand side.\n\n86\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.500\nNow my resolution is really low so\n\n87\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.810\nthat you can see my screen\nwithout actually squinting.\n\n88\n00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.590\nSo this is one of those MacBook Pros\nwith the eye-Retina thing.\n\n89\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.310\nIt'd be really tiny so\nI set it at a relatively low one.\n\n90\n00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.610\nLet's do yours, and we'll have labels,\n\n91\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.230\njust like what you're\nseeing up here in the gray.\n\n92\n00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.310\nI'm gonna come down\nwhere it says Admins and\n\n93\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.160\nthen select, look SharePoint Admin Center.\n\n94\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.810\nAnd once I do that that of\ncourse will then take me\n\n95\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.170\nto where I'm normally am\ngoing to end up going.\n\n96\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.710\nVerify that you are at the SharePoint\nAdmin Center which is what we want.\n\n97\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.970\nAnd by default once you get this,\n\n98\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.760\nyou'll probably see just about everything\n&gt;&gt; Here except for this two,\n\n99\n00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.500\nthis London and NYC, this other ones I\ncreated earlier to do some of the shows\n\n100\n00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.550\nthat we've previously done.\n\n101\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.410\nBut just like everything else\nhere is done by default,\n\n102\n00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.480\nin other words it's actually already made.\n\n103\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.490\nNow, once we get to this point, right?\n\n104\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.510\nSo, there is already a structure set up,\nthe main one is this top one\n\n105\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.950\nup here which is where the admin\ncenter A [INAUDIBLE] is going to be.\n\n106\n00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.430\nSo even though it just says\nofficeprodemcosharepointdot.com\n\n107\n00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.310\nit's really kind of the same as\nwhat we are seeing up here except\n\n108\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.110\nthis one has a slash admin\nto it is what we see.\n\n109\n00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.860\nBut that kind of represents that and\n\n110\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.030\nrepresents kind of some of\nthese of these ones too.\n\n111\n00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.620\nNow this down here is\na little bit un usual Mike\n\n112\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.970\ndo you see this one where it says\n&gt;&gt; officeprodemoco-my.sharepoint.com.\n\n113\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.890\nThat one's a little bit strange.\n\n114\n00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.420\n&gt;&gt; You see the word my and\nall of a sudden I'm thinking specific\n\n115\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.470\nto maybe the user account\nyou're logged in with.\n\n116\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.985\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n117\n00:05:32.985 --> 00:05:35.475\nMike, what I am doing over here?\n\n118\n00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:37.095\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n119\n00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:38.182\n&gt;&gt; I know my pronouns.\n\n120\n00:05:38.182 --> 00:05:39.965\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what am I doing over here, Mike?\n\n121\n00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:41.925\nYour turn.\nBut overall though, yes, that's right.\n\n122\n00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:46.505\nSo even Joey's own SharePoint\nis right here, too.\n\n123\n00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:51.310\nSo that could represent his OneDrive,\nyou name it, it's just right there, okay?\n\n124\n00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.040\nWe'll also see some other things that\nwe're going to talk about over here to\n\n125\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.360\nthe storage as well as service quotas.\n\n126\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.370\nBut this is kind of the main\nadministration site.\n\n127\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.370\nNow if you're going to create sites\neverything is pretty much gonna be listed\n\n128\n00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.320\nunderneath.\n\n129\n00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.910\nIf you have a hierarchy right,\nan organizational chart.\n\n130\n00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.680\nBut the top point, the top site click in\nitself is gonna be this one, and then all\n\n131\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.590\nthese others are essential branches off\nof that top one that we have available.\n\n132\n00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.280\nIt's analogy that I've been\nusing since we started\n\n133\n00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.010\ntalking about this way back\nto three episodes ago when I\n\n134\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.238\nmade a almost a mini series out of\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n\n135\n00:06:26.238 --> 00:06:28.400\n&gt;&gt; creating a share point kept for\n\n136\n00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.010\nexternal users.\n\n137\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.020\nIs that it's like a house or a building.\n\n138\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.720\nThat this gets you into the building.\n\n139\n00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.340\nSo this is where you're\ngoing into the building.\n\n140\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.260\nAnd each one of these would,\n\n141\n00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.960\nessentially, represent then rooms or\nareas in that building.\n\n142\n00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.950\nAnd you can lock those\ndoors if you need to.\n\n143\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.260\nSome of it's for sharing, some of it for\nsearching, you name it, compliance center.\n\n144\n00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.110\nThere's different ones that\nyou have available to you.\n\n145\n00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.350\nSo if you realize that hey,\n\n146\n00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.470\nthere's none of these rooms right here or\nwhat actually fits me.\n\n147\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.500\nYou can go to your SharePoint Admin or\nto you, okay.\n\n148\n00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.420\nAnd then you can create a new one.\n\n149\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.870\nAnd the nice thing is creating\na new one is not difficult at all.\n\n150\n00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.450\nIt is a little bit not\nintuitive at the same time.\n\n151\n00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.750\nAnd that's because the settings that\nare actually there for us, really aren't.\n\n152\n00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.710\nYou're trying to wonder what\nthey actually mean at times.\n\n153\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.770\nSo once I click on new, it's going to\ngive me this private site collection.\n\n154\n00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.770\nCreate a new site collection to\ncollaborate with partners and\n\n155\n00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.750\npeople in your organization.\n\n156\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.500\nSo now you're saying,\n\n157\n00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.630\nright, here's the webpage that I'm going\nto actually allow for Access to gun.\n\n158\n00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:35.382\nBy default everybody in your\nOffice 365 organization\n\n159\n00:07:35.382 --> 00:07:39.543\nnormally gets access to\nthose sites internally.\n\n160\n00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:43.512\nBut you can limit that restriction\nif you want to as well but\n\n161\n00:07:43.512 --> 00:07:49.020\nat the same time it's more than likely\nbecause you're trying to share this out So\n\n162\n00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.379\nonce we get the dialog box up here.\n\n163\n00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:56.077\nThis is where it begins in terms of\nus doing a new site collection Now,\n\n164\n00:07:56.077 --> 00:07:59.406\nwhen you start seeing\nthe idea of the title here.\n\n165\n00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:02.258\nLet me see if I start typing it in.\n\n166\n00:08:02.258 --> 00:08:04.630\nI couldn't remember if it was\nactually going to fill it in or not.\n\n167\n00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:10.110\nBut you want to make sure it's a title\nthat's descriptive and understandable.\n\n168\n00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.977\nPeople get very quick and\nlazy very easily.\n\n169\n00:08:12.977 --> 00:08:14.420\n&gt;&gt; A little cryptic.\n\n170\n00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cryptic.\n\n171\n00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.090\nAnd once you start doing that, people go,\nI don't know what that's about.\n\n172\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.470\nBut try to make it something that\nnormally is logical, at least,\n\n173\n00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.870\nto your organization.\n\n174\n00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.200\nSo, so far, what I've followed\nis the theme of regions, right?\n\n175\n00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.650\nI had New York, I had London,\nand we're going to continue.\n\n176\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.760\nBut we're going to stay essentially\non the East Coast across\n\n177\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.710\nthe ocean here, for right now.\n\n178\n00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.240\nSo we're going to actually create one and\nwe're just going to call this one Tampa.\n\n179\n00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:39.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n180\n00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Now, when I do that, I know that\nit may just be for the Tampa areas,\n\n181\n00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.010\nSouthern Florida,\nwhatever we want to call it here.\n\n182\n00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.330\nBut notice there is the website address.\n\n183\n00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:54.600\nWell, that's kind of the basis there and\nit's going to have this, /sites.\n\n184\n00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.750\nI can do a team site if I want to,\ninstead.\n\n185\n00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.500\nOr just a regular site.\n\n186\n00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.670\nNow the team is designed for\nthat super high collaboration thing,\n\n187\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.060\nwhere you're not only actually\nsharing my documents and files.\n\n188\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.220\nBut social media, you name it.\n\n189\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.990\nYammer, Delve.\n\n190\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.160\n&gt;&gt; Sway\n&gt;&gt; Sway, 365 Video.\n\n191\n00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.120\nI mean, it's amazing.\n\n192\n00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.480\nIt's really amazing,\nall the stuff that you can do.\n\n193\n00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.850\nBut if you're really\nneeding just the basic.\n\n194\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.040\nI just really need to share files, okay?\n\n195\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.620\nThe site is a regular way to go.\n\n196\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.430\nAnd we're just going to use kind of\nlike the airport abbreviation, right?\n\n197\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.510\nSo TPA for Tampa.\n\n198\n00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.345\nAt least I'm hoping,\nbecause that's what Mike told me.\n\n199\n00:09:34.345 --> 00:09:36.145\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what's going on here.\n\n200\n00:09:36.145 --> 00:09:38.380\nI don't fly that often, Mike.\n\n201\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.790\nMike is the one that flies\nmore often than I do.\n\n202\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.990\nAnd then you have different templates.\n\n203\n00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.410\nTemplates, which I don't know why it\nsounds weird to my ears to say that.\n\n204\n00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.760\nYou can also create too.\n\n205\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.750\nNow these templates,\nthey don't really matter so\n\n206\n00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.760\nmuch if you're just sharing files.\n\n207\n00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.450\nBut if you're going to actually\nbe developing a blog or\n\n208\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.270\na developers site, you know,\nfor these collaborations.\n\n209\n00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.660\nThey go ahead and set it up.\n\n210\n00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.220\nLike, here's how it\nlogically should fall out,\n\n211\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.150\nwhat most people are going\nto end up doing.\n\n212\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.660\nSo it is nice if you know\nwhich one you're really doing.\n\n213\n00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.720\nBut for us, we're just going\nto use a regular team site,\n\n214\n00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.320\nbecause that's the default.\n\n215\n00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.980\nNotice that there are also enterprise ones\nthat are also available to us, as well.\n\n216\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.120\nSo it might be where you are,\nactually doing it document center.\n\n217\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.865\nWe're going to actually do\ne-discovery on another episode too.\n\n218\n00:10:23.865 --> 00:10:26.580\nAnd talk about that the basis of that.\n\n219\n00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.960\nAnd you have to create\na SharePoint site just for\n\n220\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.510\nthe ediscovery information that\ncomes in when you're doing that.\n\n221\n00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.580\nSo you name it,\nthere's one for publishing.\n\n222\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:40.150\nAnd of course, this one, enterprise\nwiki as well as a publishing portal.\n\n223\n00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.210\nAnd if any of that doesn't fit,\nyou, of course,\n\n224\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.630\ncan create your own if you choose to.\n\n225\n00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.930\nBut I am just going to use the default\nbecause that is easy enough for\n\n226\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.190\nme to understand.\n\n227\n00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.990\nWhich is going to create\nexactly what I want it to do.\n\n228\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.810\nSelecting the time zone.\n\n229\n00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.340\nTime zones, excuse me, is also important.\n\n230\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.350\nSo that everybody knows\nwhen documents come in and\n\n231\n00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.250\nit gives them the time that is\nactually proper to where they are.\n\n232\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:06.700\nAnd then you want to make sure you also\nselect a site collection administrator.\n\n233\n00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.240\nNow, this one here, as I hover over it,\n\n234\n00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.460\ni'm hoping that tool tip\nwill come back up here.\n\n235\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.380\nThere I go.\n\n236\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.600\nNotice it says enter primary\nadminister name for your collection,\n\n237\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.200\nonly one username can be provided.\n\n238\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.100\nSo there's a primary site or\na primary administrator.\n\n239\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.740\nAnd then you can have a site\ncollection administrator as well.\n\n240\n00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.160\nThat means you can\ndelegate more permissions.\n\n241\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.570\nBut this is the guy that\nessentially owns the site, okay?\n\n242\n00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.940\nSo it's right here and let's see.\n\n243\n00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.950\nI'm going to actually say Joey again,\nbecause it's actually easy.\n\n244\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.590\nAnd there is a Joey Fatone.\n\n245\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:43.610\nHe's good on this.\n\n246\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.990\nAnd now Mike,\nthis is where I said it's not intuitive.\n\n247\n00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.300\nEverything else seems\nintuitive at this point.\n\n248\n00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.050\nBut now we come to this\nweird thing right here.\n\n249\n00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.720\nServer resource quota.\n\n250\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.570\n&gt;&gt; You're going to have\nto help me on this one.\n\n251\n00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.250\nWhat exactly is a server resource quota?\n\n252\n00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.300\n&gt;&gt; It really doesn't make\nsense to most of you.\n\n253\n00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.170\nWe've never dealt with\nthe idea of trying to manage\n\n254\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.100\ncloud technologies a lot of time.\n\n255\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:16.380\nBut it's really about the resource usage\nof RAM and CPU when it comes down to it.\n\n256\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.660\nAnd it's a number that\nthey've assigned to that\n\n257\n00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.770\nparticular combination of resource and\nutilization, is what we have.\n\n258\n00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.550\nOn mine, because I've already\ncreated a couple of other sites,\n\n259\n00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:33.640\nmy resource of the number of resources\nI have is limited, down to 600.\n\n260\n00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.310\nEach one, by default, is given 300 here.\n\n261\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.540\nSo, what that means for\nme is if I just create the defaults,\n\n262\n00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.000\nI might have the ability\nto create one more site.\n\n263\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.400\nBut then I'm done.\n\n264\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.660\nOr, I can actually just go, look,\n\n265\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.130\nI don't think I'm going to be\nusing that many resources.\n\n266\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.560\nAnd I can change this.\n\n267\n00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:53.280\nBut this one is normally dependent\nupon the RAM and CPU utilization.\n\n268\n00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.470\nAnd it used to also combine together them\nwith the number of licences that you had.\n\n269\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.450\nYou had to multiply that by something and\n\n270\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.025\nthen you had to stand on your head and\nclose your eyes.\n\n271\n00:13:05.025 --> 00:13:06.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Spin around a bat three times and\n\n272\n00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.920\nrun in a straight line.\n\n273\n00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.930\nI don't remember.\n\n274\n00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.120\nSomebody out there knows.\n\n275\n00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.630\nBut let's put it this way.\n\n276\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.950\nIt's utilization and\nthis is how much access you have.\n\n277\n00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.810\nThe reason why that's important is\nbecause the overall site is given\n\n278\n00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.920\na certain amount of utilization.\n\n279\n00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.280\nNow, can you purchase more?\n\n280\n00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.220\nMore than likely you can go in there and\nactually up your purchase.\n\n281\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.590\nI know you can do it for\nthe storage stuff.\n\n282\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.920\nI'll show you in a moment how I\ncan prove that to you very easily.\n\n283\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.140\nYou know that Microsoft is in the realm\nof selling in just a moment here.\n\n284\n00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.220\nBut this one is,\nit is a little bit tricky, right.\n\n285\n00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.310\nIf your site is going to be heavy usage.\n\n286\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.320\nYou know that it's going to\nbe really populated a lot.\n\n287\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.020\nYou need to assign more resources to it.\n\n288\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Than normal.\n\n289\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.040\nIf you go, it's going to be for\nsharing but we don't know how often.\n\n290\n00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.090\nYou may want to assign lets.\n\n291\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.690\nYou can always adjust it later on.\n\n292\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo as long as we can go back later and\n\n293\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.170\nchange it if we need to, really\nthe idea here is just making sure that\n\n294\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.230\none site collection doesn't\nsuck up all the resources.\n\n295\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.930\nSo other site collections, people are\nwaiting, they get the spinning cheerio or\n\n296\n00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:08.850\nwhat have you.\n\n297\n00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.900\nThis is just a way to kind of put a cap\non things in case something goes.\n\n298\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.050\nYou might have a site that doesn't\nnormally suck up a lot of resources.\n\n299\n00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:20.160\nBut they got some really heavy usage or\nsomething has gone wrong and\n\n300\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.390\nit's just eating up memory.\n\n301\n00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.200\nAnd could up shutting other sites down or\nmaking them inaccessible.\n\n302\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.980\nSo this way, just put a cap on it.\n\n303\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n304\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.160\nAnd once we do that,\nwhich is really important.\n\n305\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.200\nBecause if we do, right, people won't\nbe able to gain access to other sites.\n\n306\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.350\nSo it is really about splitting up\nthe resource that are available.\n\n307\n00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.150\nIt's going to begin as creation process.\n\n308\n00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.300\nAnd while Mike was talking, it did\nfloat up a little button or a little\n\n309\n00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.950\npanel that said this could take up to 15\nminutes before it's actually created.\n\n310\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.060\nSo it does take a little bit of time for\nthis stuff to actually use here.\n\n311\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.140\nNow, while we're doing that, I wanted to\npoint this out here, Mike, because I said.\n\n312\n00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.525\nI can tell that Microsoft is in\nthe business of actually selling.\n\n313\n00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:05.500\nBecause if you take a look at\nsomething here, look at that.\n\n314\n00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You can actually\n\n315\n00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.330\nbuy more if you need to.\n\n316\n00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.750\nSo, whatever the beginning was now,\n\n317\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.175\nthis one though is currently\ndisabled right now.\n\n318\n00:15:12.175 --> 00:15:14.170\nBecause we're actually\nconfiguring a new site.\n\n319\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.130\nI'm going to be actually\na little bit less at this point.\n\n320\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.990\nBut since I may not have permission.\n\n321\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.216\nBut I haven't selected anything.\n\n322\n00:15:19.216 --> 00:15:23.290\nSo it's going to take a bit of time\nbefore this thing finishes generating.\n\n323\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.230\nAnd what we actually need to do.\n\n324\n00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.560\nAnd then we'll take a look at that\nidea of a storage quota as well, okay?\n\n325\n00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.208\nBut let's go ahead and do this.\n\n326\n00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:35.080\nWe're going to take kind of a brief\ntime out, let this thing complete, and\n\n327\n00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.650\nthen we'll go on and we'll see.\n\n328\n00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.880\nWhat are some of the other configurations\nthat we need to get it set up for\n\n329\n00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.760\nthe site to be available for us?\n\n330\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.060\nRight, there it is through the magic\nof what we see here as far as our\n\n331\n00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:47.990\ntimeout goes.\n\n332\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.543\nIt only took a few minutes for\nour site to be created.\n\n333\n00:15:50.543 --> 00:15:52.843\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer again.\n\n334\n00:15:52.843 --> 00:15:55.542\nAnd now you'll see,\nthere it is nice and shiny.\n\n335\n00:15:55.542 --> 00:15:57.744\nAnd it even has a little green icon.\n\n336\n00:15:57.744 --> 00:16:00.686\nI'm pretty sure everybody's gonna\nactually be able to read that.\n\n337\n00:16:00.686 --> 00:16:03.587\nYou see that, Mike,\nright there where it actually says, new.\n\n338\n00:16:03.587 --> 00:16:04.297\n&gt;&gt; It says new, I can see that from here.\n\n339\n00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.137\n&gt;&gt; Now if I actually do that\non the regular full size.\n\n340\n00:16:06.137 --> 00:16:07.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man, not so much.\n\n341\n00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:08.830\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not so much.\n\n342\n00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.230\nSo it's very diminutive.\n\n343\n00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.620\nThey don't really state it out in\nthe open that everything is new.\n\n344\n00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.930\nBut apparently you are supposed\nto be able to do this.\n\n345\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:16.605\nAnd there it is.\n\n346\n00:16:16.605 --> 00:16:21.580\nOur site collection is now set up the way\nthat we actually want it as well.\n\n347\n00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.490\nNow as we do something like this, there's\na couple of other things we need to talk\n\n348\n00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:29.700\nabout which is that not only do\nwe set a resource quota here, but\n\n349\n00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:35.930\nwe also were able to set up, all right,\nlet's see here, the idea of storage, too.\n\n350\n00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.810\nSo when it comes down to it we have to\nactually worry about resource utilization,\n\n351\n00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.090\nwhich is a big one.\n\n352\n00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.230\nAnd here's the reserve portal\nthat we set up from here.\n\n353\n00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.360\nBut notice we also need to talk\nabout the idea of storage, too.\n\n354\n00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.920\n&gt;&gt; So how does the storage then\ndiffer from the resource quota?\n\n355\n00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.760\n&gt;&gt; This one's a lot easier in terms\nof the concept of what it is, right?\n\n356\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.380\nThis is how much space we have access to.\n\n357\n00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.440\nBut this one, there actually is\nmath that's involved, real math,\n\n358\n00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.037\nnot SharePoint viewed.\n\n359\n00:17:05.037 --> 00:17:07.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I keep saying that I don't mean that.\n\n360\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.780\nGuys on the SharePoint team, it's really\nneat how you all figure this stuff out.\n\n361\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.500\nIt is way beyond me.\n\n362\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.390\nThat's what it comes down to, and\n\n363\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.297\nwhen I read them like that's magic,\nthat's what it comes down to but.\n\n364\n00:17:18.297 --> 00:17:20.543\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure that they figured it out\n\n365\n00:17:20.543 --> 00:17:24.840\nsuccessfully, but on this one it\nreally is about the mathematics.\n\n366\n00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.000\nRight away once you actually create\nyour entire SharePoint site,\n\n367\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.290\nyou get ten gigs just by default.\n\n368\n00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.420\nNow you could buy more.\n\n369\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.280\nI showed you where.\n\n370\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.590\nIt’s like, hey, you want to buy more?\n\n371\n00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.560\nOf course, we'll sell you more so\nyou can expand out as big as you want to.\n\n372\n00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.360\nBut if you do it as a default,\nyou get ten gigs by default.\n\n373\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:49.260\nAnd then every user that you're going to\nhave as far as a licensed Office 365 user,\n\n374\n00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.885\nyou get 50 megabytes per user,\n500 megabytes, not 50.\n\n375\n00:17:53.885 --> 00:17:55.527\nThat's gonna be really tiny.\n\n376\n00:17:55.527 --> 00:17:57.669\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 30 years ago [INAUDIBLE].\n\n377\n00:17:57.669 --> 00:18:01.741\nYou're saying that I have 50 people,\nI'm giving 12.5 gigs,\n\n378\n00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:03.755\nnot exactly gigantic there.\n\n379\n00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:06.975\nBut no, it's 500 megabytes per user.\n\n380\n00:18:06.975 --> 00:18:08.195\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So for example,\n\n381\n00:18:08.195 --> 00:18:13.040\nif I have 10 gigs to begin with\n&gt;&gt; And now I have five users, right?\n\n382\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.370\nWell, that's another 5 gigs,\nso that gives me now 15 gigs\n\n383\n00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.670\nthat can be distributed\nthroughout my site as well, okay?\n\n384\n00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.740\nNow when you actually\nenable something like this,\n\n385\n00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.222\nthis is where it gets a little bit tricky.\n\n386\n00:18:26.222 --> 00:18:27.380\nNow I've already done this so\n\n387\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.910\nthat you can see a couple of things But\nthe weird thing is this, guys.\n\n388\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.550\nAnd that's why we're actually\nseeing all of this stuff here.\n\n389\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.200\nThe server quota resource,\nusage, storage limits.\n\n390\n00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.660\nAnd it's really broken down\nhere per gigabyte limit.\n\n391\n00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.850\nThat's a that's the upper limit, but\nnotice I haven't really used much,\n\n392\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.826\n0.3 here, actually 0.03.\n\n393\n00:18:47.826 --> 00:18:53.223\nSo not even three-tenths of a percent yet,\n0.05 is what we're seeing.\n\n394\n00:18:53.223 --> 00:18:55.185\nNow over here on the storyboard,\n\n395\n00:18:55.185 --> 00:18:58.520\nthis is the upper limit\nwhich is a lot of gigabytes.\n\n396\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.550\nIf you take a look at that now,\nMike, you help me out here.\n\n397\n00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.483\n&gt;&gt; I'm seeing.\n\n398\n00:19:03.483 --> 00:19:04.730\n&gt;&gt; 25,600, yeah.\n\n399\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.870\n&gt;&gt; That's the upper limit.\n\n400\n00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:11.990\nSo about 25 terabytes, 25.5 terabytes or\nso, is what they're saying.\n\n401\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.530\nHere's the limitation that you have.\n\n402\n00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.330\nMost of us are never going to use that,\nso it's not a limitation that we normally\n\n403\n00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.080\nhave to worry about as far\nas the upper limit goes.\n\n404\n00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.740\nBut it is going to require you to buy\nmore if you do something like that\n\n405\n00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.290\nbeyond what we have.\n\n406\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.500\nBut one of the things is that\nmanually it's not set up.\n\n407\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.770\nSo in other words,\nI've got automatic set up here, okay?\n\n408\n00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.430\nAnd the reason why I can see that is that\nthere's suppose to be an icon that shows\n\n409\n00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.280\nup up here that says hey,\nset your storage quota.\n\n410\n00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.650\nBut are you noticing that it's missing?\n\n411\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.250\nIt's actually not there.\n\n412\n00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.140\nSo if you need to do that and\nthat icon's not there,\n\n413\n00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.140\nyou have to know how to go in and\nset this up and change it.\n\n414\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.210\nAnd the way that you do that is over here\non the left-hand side is in the navigation\n\n415\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:01.310\nwe're gonna come down to settings\nunder the SharePoint admin center, and\n\n416\n00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.250\nhopefully it will change the webpage.\n\n417\n00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.410\nLook, it didn't give me another tab,\n\n418\n00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.050\nI'm kind of already liking\nit now a little bit more.\n\n419\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.150\nBut once we have that,\nthis is where we go.\n\n420\n00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.210\nSite Collection Storage Management.\n\n421\n00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.640\nAutomatic storage management provides\nworry free operation by removing overhead,\n\n422\n00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.750\nhaving to manage\nindividual storage limits.\n\n423\n00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:24.190\nThat sounds awesome for a small company\nthat doesn't really have to worry about.\n\n424\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.470\nAnd that's what I would\ngenerally leave it at.\n\n425\n00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.850\n&gt;&gt; But if you have to really manage your\nspace, because you're really using data,\n\n426\n00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:34.000\nthat means you have to come over here and\nflip this over manually.\n\n427\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.713\nAnd once you do that, then I have\nto scroll down to the bottom, and\n\n428\n00:20:38.713 --> 00:20:39.838\nthen click OK.\n\n429\n00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:45.860\nAnd once we actually click OK,\nit should be changing things.\n\n430\n00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.800\nAnd now you can see.\n\n431\n00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.060\nLook at that, Mike.\n\n432\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.590\nAll of a sudden there it is, so yeah.\n\n433\n00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.243\nSo if it's not showing up make sure you\ngo into the settings and change that.\n\n434\n00:20:55.243 --> 00:20:59.450\nNow you're probably like,\nRonnie, that seems easy enough.\n\n435\n00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.440\nWell, remember that a lot of times\npeople that try to go in and\n\n436\n00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.170\ntake these professional\nlevel certifications.\n\n437\n00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.988\nThey just think, yeah,\nsetting a storage quota, no big deal.\n\n438\n00:21:08.988 --> 00:21:12.555\nIt's right, I've seen it before, I looked\nover Ronnie's shoulder, I've seen it\n\n439\n00:21:12.555 --> 00:21:16.039\nbefore and then they get, and they're\nlike, it's not, where the heck do I go?\n\n440\n00:21:16.039 --> 00:21:18.540\nYou got to know how to turn this stuff on.\n\n441\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.267\nSo if you're not spending time and you're\nnot really doing this yet and you're using\n\n442\n00:21:22.267 --> 00:21:25.490\na trial account, make sure you're go\nin and click on all these features.\n\n443\n00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.629\nTake a look at them because if\nthere's anything that will get you,\n\n444\n00:21:28.629 --> 00:21:32.290\nit's just not knowing how to make\nthat feature available to you.\n\n445\n00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.270\nSo once you have that set up, and\n\n446\n00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.340\nnow I select Tampa,\nthe site that I just created.\n\n447\n00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.180\nI can now go to the storage quota and\n\n448\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.460\nmanually set up this particular quota,\nif it ever shows up for me.\n\n449\n00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:44.960\nThere we go.\n\n450\n00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.640\nSo here it is by default.\n\n451\n00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:53.617\nCurrent tenant storage allocation,\nright about a terabyte is available.\n\n452\n00:21:53.617 --> 00:22:00.990\nSo about half, I've used somewhere about a\nhalf a gig, somewhere, is what I've used.\n\n453\n00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.750\nThe upper limit, of course, is what\nwe were saying a little bit earlier,\n\n454\n00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.020\nabout 25 terabytes.\n\n455\n00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.965\nWe're probably not gonna do that.\n\n456\n00:22:07.965 --> 00:22:14.780\nOnce I reach 98% of 25 gigs, actually\nof this one up here, of the 1 gig.\n\n457\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.660\nThen it should send me an email.\n\n458\n00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.270\nSo we can go ahead and\nset that up if we wanted to.\n\n459\n00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.089\nWe just simply change that to\nwhat we want as the maximum,\n\n460\n00:22:22.089 --> 00:22:24.747\nand that is how we can set up\nour quotas if we choose to.\n\n461\n00:22:24.747 --> 00:22:27.271\nI'm not gonna worry about\nsetting that up for right now,\n\n462\n00:22:27.271 --> 00:22:29.070\nbut that's how you can do that.\n\n463\n00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.515\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, now I've gotta\nask because I do love my PowerShell.\n\n464\n00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:33.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can\n\n465\n00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.790\nwe possibly do this through PowerShell?\n\n466\n00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.720\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou gotta know that you can, right?\n\n467\n00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.440\nSo like anything else on the exam,\nif you can do it inside the GUI,\n\n468\n00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.610\nmore than likely you're gonna be\nable to do it inside of PowerShell.\n\n469\n00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.840\nSo the same thing applies as we go into\nPowerShell to be able to manage this.\n\n470\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.740\nI want to make sure I'm actually\noutside my screen before, and\n\n471\n00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.430\nactually on the right computer,\ntoo, when I do this.\n\n472\n00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:59.380\nSo I'm going to just open\nup my PowerShell prompt.\n\n473\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.960\nAs we do this, you've gotta verify\nthat you are still connected and\n\n474\n00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.960\nthat you actually have\neverything else open.\n\n475\n00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.890\nSo the way that I do that\nis I type in get sposite.\n\n476\n00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.210\nAnd as long as I get list of sites back,\n\n477\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:17.350\nthen I know that I'm still\nconnected into the SharePoint site.\n\n478\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.110\nIf I don't,\nif you don't get anything, it means\n\n479\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.240\nI need to re-establish the connection,\nand we have done in the previous episode.\n\n480\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.570\nSo go back and watch that one, too.\n\n481\n00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.990\nAnd look at that,\nthere's a new site that we just created.\n\n482\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.060\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Right there under Joey and so\n\n483\n00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.260\nwe are now ready to go.\n\n484\n00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.183\nNow one of the things that is\ncalling out specifically, okay,\n\n485\n00:23:36.183 --> 00:23:38.339\nwhich is kind of an unusual thing.\n\n486\n00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:41.274\nBut on the exam, is not only going\nto be able to do it in the GUI,\n\n487\n00:23:41.274 --> 00:23:43.315\nwhich I kind of showed\nyou a bit about that.\n\n488\n00:23:43.315 --> 00:23:46.999\nBut also in PowerShell and\nsome of the weirder, I always say weirder,\n\n489\n00:23:46.999 --> 00:23:51.134\nsome of the more obscure things sometimes\nis what they want you to be able to do.\n\n490\n00:23:51.134 --> 00:23:57.245\nSo for example if they say hey,\nwe need to set a resource Limit here okay?\n\n491\n00:23:57.245 --> 00:24:00.370\nA quota for what we need to do.\n\n492\n00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.807\nWell you have to be able\nto know how to do that.\n\n493\n00:24:02.807 --> 00:24:06.564\nSo let's go ahead and\nset up a couple of different ones for\n\n494\n00:24:06.564 --> 00:24:09.090\nus to get started here, okay?\n\n495\n00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:16.400\nSo, I'm going to choose set SPO site,\nif I can spell site.\n\n496\n00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.660\nAnd then I need to set\nthe identity of that site that I'm\n\n497\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.590\ngoing to connect to.\n\n498\n00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:35.220\nSo if I do https//officepro\n[LAUGH] demogo.on Microsoft.com.\n\n499\n00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.935\nThis is why you don't let Don Pezet\ncreate your domain names.\n\n500\n00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:40.420\n[LAUGH] What ends up happening.\n\n501\n00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.680\nNo, normally he does good, but\napparently he wanted to make sure that\n\n502\n00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.860\nI had a lot of typing to do,\nis what he wanted to do here.\n\n503\n00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.790\nSo, I'm not going to do it for\none, it's our new one here.\n\n504\n00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.730\nSo, let's do it for TPA.\n\n505\n00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:56.120\nIf you're not exactly sure,\njust copy down the URL you get up here for\n\n506\n00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.930\nthe site that you're actually\ntaking a look at, okay?\n\n507\n00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:03.054\nNow once you're here, and we wanna set up,\nlet's say the storage quota.\n\n508\n00:25:03.054 --> 00:25:05.735\nAll I have to do is type in storage quota,\nat this point.\n\n509\n00:25:05.735 --> 00:25:08.816\nAnd now,\nI think I originally set it for 100.\n\n510\n00:25:08.816 --> 00:25:10.409\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n511\n00:25:10.409 --> 00:25:13.990\n&gt;&gt; I can actually set it for\n200, if I want to.\n\n512\n00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.890\nSo, I can go ahead and type that in.\n\n513\n00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.570\nAnd then I can also set\nup a quota warning,\n\n514\n00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.255\njust like what we saw two\na little bit earlier.\n\n515\n00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:25.140\nOops, if I could spell.\n\n516\n00:25:27.117 --> 00:25:33.470\nQuota level warning and I can set\nthat to be let's say 100 instead.\n\n517\n00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.953\nSo we can go ahead and\ndo something like this if we choose to.\n\n518\n00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:44.720\nAnd now it's actually, it's not\nmanaged by, in a path to this tenet.\n\n519\n00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.860\nAll right, here.\n\n520\n00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.410\nSo once again, a typo has kind of\nhit me in a couple of places, right?\n\n521\n00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.210\nRemember when I said I should\njust copy it from up here,\n\n522\n00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.200\nwell I messed up in a couple of places,\nright?\n\n523\n00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.095\nNot only did I have sight\n[INAUDIBLE] on Microsoft.com,\n\n524\n00:26:00.095 --> 00:26:02.420\nwhich is supposed to be SharePoint.\n\n525\n00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.342\nSo if I hit my up arrow,\nI should be able to correct both of those.\n\n526\n00:26:06.342 --> 00:26:08.720\nAt least in theory I should be able to.\n\n527\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.748\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] One of those cases point.\n\n528\n00:26:10.748 --> 00:26:13.161\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] do as Ronnie says,\nnot as he does.\n\n529\n00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:14.270\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n530\n00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:18.780\nBecause, again, me talking and typing\nat the same time, I can't chew gum and\n\n531\n00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.450\nwalk in a straight line at the same time,\nbetter yet do something like this.\n\n532\n00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.950\nSo unless everything else, so\n\n533\n00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.990\nthat's actually a better\nhopeful sign at this point.\n\n534\n00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:30.650\nWhether it's gonna time out or not what\nshe ends up seeing here in just a moment.\n\n535\n00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.790\nBut at least, it's working a little bit\nharder to give me an error which is\n\n536\n00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.520\nactually good cuz it's not\nidentifying it right away.\n\n537\n00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.650\nBut there are going to be some different\nthings like that typos are probably my\n\n538\n00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.340\nbiggest mistake.\n\n539\n00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I was going to ask.\n\n540\n00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.762\nObviously typos can get you.\n\n541\n00:26:42.762 --> 00:26:44.090\nThat's gonna get anybody or\n\n542\n00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.290\nanything else we need to worry\nabout when we're setting this up?\n\n543\n00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.220\n&gt;&gt; There are a couple of different\nthings that you have to be aware of\n\n544\n00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.250\nas you start to deal with PowerShell and\nas you start to do this.\n\n545\n00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.210\nOne of course, when you start to do this,\n\n546\n00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.380\nis that you have to be the SharePoint\nOnline global admin, to be able to\n\n547\n00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:05.110\ncreate sites and to modify these things,\nwith using the PowerShell here.\n\n548\n00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.700\nIf you're not that, if you're just\nthat site collection administrator,\n\n549\n00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.910\nyou're not gonna be able\nto do some of this stuff.\n\n550\n00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.150\nIt's just not gonna allow\nyou to change it around.\n\n551\n00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:16.940\nThe other thing that you have to actually\nbe aware of, if you're like me and\n\n552\n00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.973\nyou're doing testing, right, you tend\nto end up creating that collection and\n\n553\n00:27:20.973 --> 00:27:22.197\nthen you delete it out.\n\n554\n00:27:22.197 --> 00:27:26.604\nWell that saves it into a recycle bin,\nis what it ends up saving it into and\n\n555\n00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:28.680\nthen you create the site how?\n\n556\n00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.860\nNormally by just duplicating\nthe same thing that you did.\n\n557\n00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.140\nWell, it's gonna also fail if you try and\ncreate a site with the exact same name and\n\n558\n00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.890\nwhat you just deleted\nis in the recycle bin.\n\n559\n00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.750\nWeird stuff ends up happening with that,\nand\n\n560\n00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:45.040\nI'm sure Mike might be able to explain why\nthat happens, but I don't know exactly-\n\n561\n00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.780\n&gt;&gt; You try to put logic to Microsoft, and\n\n562\n00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.930\nsometimes that doesn't work.\n\n563\n00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:48.980\nLove you, Microsoft.\n\n564\n00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.490\nBut here probably because we know\nthat when it goes to the recycle bin,\n\n565\n00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.500\nit's not really deleted yet\nbecause we can recover it.\n\n566\n00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.690\nSo it's still aware of that name and it's\nstill, what if you wanted to restore it\n\n567\n00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.880\nfrom the recycle bin, and you had\nmade another site with the same name,\n\n568\n00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.120\nnow it's gonna cause a problem when you're\ntrying to restore it from recycle bin.\n\n569\n00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.730\nSo it's probably saving that as\na unique name until it's official gone.\n\n570\n00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nonce in a light that happens, right?\n\n571\n00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.620\nThen you have to kinda wait and\nget figured that out.\n\n572\n00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.969\nBut those are kind of the two big gotchas\nwhen it comes down to making sure\n\n573\n00:28:18.969 --> 00:28:20.868\nsomething like this happens.\n\n574\n00:28:20.868 --> 00:28:24.620\nNow, my computer is still going on and\nso it could be a couple of things have\n\n575\n00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.260\nactually changed here that I\nprobably shouldn't have done.\n\n576\n00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.140\nWhich is we already have this and\n\n577\n00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.800\ntry and modify the actual\nquota of an existing site.\n\n578\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.760\nI probably should've tried to create\nthis site and do that at the same time.\n\n579\n00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.270\nBut it's either trying to\nrecreate the site and do it,\n\n580\n00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.400\nwhich is gonna take us\na little bit of time.\n\n581\n00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.655\nAnd so that we just have to wait on this.\n\n582\n00:28:44.655 --> 00:28:47.640\nSom what we're gonna do is we're just\ngonna take a brief time out again\n\n583\n00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.750\nuntil this thing finishes and\nwe'll be right back.\n\n584\n00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.490\nAll right, so\nit's actually finally done here.\n\n585\n00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.992\nSo through the magic and\nprobably another two minutes we're back.\n\n586\n00:28:58.992 --> 00:29:02.120\nSo let's go and take a look here\nas everything is now finished.\n\n587\n00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.590\nNothing is changed here but\njust realize that you can do this\n\n588\n00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.190\nby taking a look at this\nentire thing here, right?\n\n589\n00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.480\nWe can do the whole thing\ninside of PowerShell as well.\n\n590\n00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.250\nNow the other thing of course is that\nwe can actually create a new site.\n\n591\n00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.110\nSo if I type in newSPOsite, it oops,\n\n592\n00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:25.450\nSPO site,\nwhich is apparently harder than I think.\n\n593\n00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.790\nNow, I can go ahead and create a new URL.\n\n594\n00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.350\nAnd I think I actuall challenged\nmyself to do, I don't know why.\n\n595\n00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:37.557\nI should have actually said,\nRonnie, typing is not your\n\n596\n00:29:37.557 --> 00:29:42.773\nstrong suit here,\ndemoco.sharepoint.com/sites.\n\n597\n00:29:42.773 --> 00:29:47.940\nAnd this one I was gonna make it for\nus here, right here in Gainesville.\n\n598\n00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.190\nNow we can also add in\nwho the owner is too.\n\n599\n00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:57.826\nSo, I could do owner and\nthis one would make it\n\n600\n00:29:57.826 --> 00:30:02.588\njoey@officeprodemocoonmicrosoft.com.\n\n601\n00:30:02.588 --> 00:30:07.539\nAnd you always wanna add in a title, now,\n\n602\n00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:13.481\nthe title is the same as what\nwe would call a name and\n\n603\n00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:19.180\nI'll put this one in parentheses here.\n\n604\n00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:19.780\nGainesville.\n\n605\n00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.320\nNow, when we do this, this should\nactually create that new site for\n\n606\n00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.350\nus, that would give us a new name and\nthe URL.\n\n607\n00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.307\nAnd this one now I should say,\nwhat's the storage quota?\n\n608\n00:30:33.307 --> 00:30:36.110\nAnd we'll do 50 for right now.\n\n609\n00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.670\nAnd now just let it actually build.\n\n610\n00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:42.200\nNow, when it does this it\ncan take up to 15 minutes.\n\n611\n00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.700\nAgain, I'm not so worried about that\ncuz it will end up completing and\n\n612\n00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.730\nwe'll be fine.\n\n613\n00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.500\nBut those are kinda the commands\nthat we definitely need to make\n\n614\n00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.640\nsure that you take a look at.\n\n615\n00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.998\nCreating a new site using PowerShell,\nmaking sure that you can actually apply\n\n616\n00:30:57.998 --> 00:31:03.690\na name cuz that's gonna be important,\nremember that, in the PowerShell itself.\n\n617\n00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:07.550\nEven though it's called title, it's\nthe same as what's actually a name when it\n\n618\n00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:12.250\ncomes down to things that normally ask us\nabout creating these things like the exam.\n\n619\n00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.030\nSo we just wanna point out\njust some little hints here\n\n620\n00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.300\nwhen you start to do this.\n\n621\n00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:21.710\nBut pay attention especially on this\npart too, get into SharePoint itself.\n\n622\n00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:26.790\nVery important that you take time and\nreally dig in there\n\n623\n00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.750\nwhen you think that there's a feature\nthat's missing, it's probably not missing.\n\n624\n00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.920\nIt's just not there, okay.\n\n625\n00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.889\nNow here we go.\n\n626\n00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:34.760\nGreat, see as I was talking,\n\n627\n00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.860\nI was like this thing is going to\ntake 20 minutes for all I know.\n\n628\n00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.665\nBut as I finished up here,\nif everything is good, I can now do my\n\n629\n00:31:41.665 --> 00:31:47.460\nget-sposite.\n\n630\n00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.110\nAnd in a moment, there it is,\nlook at that one.\n\n631\n00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.170\nHopefully I can highlight it.\n\n632\n00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:56.200\nAnd there we go it's set up exactly\nthe way that I had configured\n\n633\n00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.020\nit inside of PowerShell and ready to go.\n\n634\n00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.160\nI guess the smaller the storage quota\nthe faster everything actually got\n\n635\n00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.700\nwhich is great.\n\n636\n00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.190\nI wish I would have remembered\nthat when I was doing\n\n637\n00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.950\nsome other creations there at times.\n\n638\n00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:10.380\nBut this is how you can manage everything.\n\n639\n00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:10.910\nOnce again,\n\n640\n00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:14.900\nif you can put all this together into\na script, it really does help, right?\n\n641\n00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.260\nBeing able to run that and\nmake it much faster.\n\n642\n00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.130\nAnd inside a production environment,\n\n643\n00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.750\nI'm assuming that's what you'll\nend up doing more often.\n\n644\n00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.390\nBut learning right here whether\nyou actually go through the GUI or\n\n645\n00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.520\nwhether you can do it inside\nthe PowerShell, it's kind of key.\n\n646\n00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.470\nPowerShell of course is going\nto be key on the exam as well.\n\n647\n00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:35.400\nBut in SharePoint there's so many settings\nthat are just not intuitively where you\n\n648\n00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.590\nexpect them to be, that you're not going\nto be able to get through 25% of the exam\n\n649\n00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:45.720\nwithout you spending serious time inside\nof the Office 365 SharePoint admin center.\n\n650\n00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.020\nIt's just not gonna happen.\n\n651\n00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.770\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie,\nwords to live by there.\n\n652\n00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.020\nIf you're preparing for this exam,\n\n653\n00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:54.830\nmake sure you spend your time getting\nused to your SharePoint interface.\n\n654\n00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.457\nAnd as you said as well, parameterized\nPowerShell, that's just the way to go.\n\n655\n00:32:59.457 --> 00:33:01.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, but anyway,\n\n656\n00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.380\ngreat stuff there Ronnie,\ngreat explanations,\n\n657\n00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.660\ndemonstrations on creating sites a couple\ndifferent ways right through the GUI\n\n658\n00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.240\nusing PowerShell,\nconfiguring those sites in SharePoint.\n\n659\n00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.520\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n660\n00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.700\nWe hope everybody out there enjoyed\nwatching this one, signing off for\n\n661\n00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.250\nITProTV, I've been your host,\nMike

You are watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.630\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Enabling Office 365\nSeries, I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.560\nNow, in business today,\nwe see a lot of teams and group efforts.\n\n7\n00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.620\nAnd when we talk about software,\nthat really isn't any different,\n\n8\n00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.320\nwe're talking about our tools that\nwe need to provide collaboration.\n\n9\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640\nSo in this episode, we're really gonna be\nfocusing on those collaboration tools, and\n\n10\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.070\nlearning how to provide and\nplan a collaboration method.\n\n11\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.016\nWith us today, back in studios we\nhave Mr Ronnie Wong, thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:39.905\njoining us Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:41.158\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n14\n00:00:41.158 --> 00:00:45.815\nhaving me back as we continue in to\ntaking a look at Office 365 services.\n\n15\n00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:50.598\nAnd a big part of the idea of providing\nthose types of services is the idea of\n\n16\n00:00:50.598 --> 00:00:54.391\nwhat Cherokee was talking\nabout collaboration, right.\n\n17\n00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:56.503\nThe idea of collaboration, though,\n\n18\n00:00:56.503 --> 00:01:00.529\nis something that may be a little bit\nstrange to you if you happened to have\n\n19\n00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:04.753\njust moved from a company that might\nnot have done any collaboration at all,\n\n20\n00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:09.500\nto a company that says, we love doing\nthis type of collaboration idea.\n\n21\n00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.830\nSo, now you're probably\nstuck in the middle, and\n\n22\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.430\nyou're probably wondering, what do we\nmean by setting up and planning for\n\n23\n00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.120\na collaboration method, or\na solution that we might have.\n\n24\n00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.400\nWell, the great thing is, there's\ndifferent ways that we can do this.\n\n25\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.120\nAnd so that's what we wanna talk about,\n\n26\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.710\nis some of the different\nmethods that you may choose\n\n27\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.430\nto allow your business to actually do the\nfull on collaboration that it needs to.\n\n28\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.120\nSo let me, Cherokee, then let's make\nsure that we understand this idea of\n\n29\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.490\ncollaboration here for a moment.\n\n30\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.960\nMost companies, when they start off,\nand the small infrastructure,\n\n31\n00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.260\nmost people just think about the idea\nof just sharing out a single file.\n\n32\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.210\nSo we have a centralized share,\nyou can gain access document,\n\n33\n00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.580\nI can gain access to the document.\n\n34\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.070\nThere may be limitations there, right,\nsuch as you and I can't work on that\n\n35\n00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.930\nsame document together, okay,\nwhen we have something like that.\n\n36\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.900\nSo that's a possible limitation that, but\nit is a form of collaboration, right,\n\n37\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.180\nif I put it up there and I go CHerokee,\ncan you review this document for me?\n\n38\n00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.390\nSo that makes sense, right?\n\n39\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.610\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\n\n40\n00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.530\nthere may even come a time when I say,\nalso Cherokee,\n\n41\n00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.240\nI need you to go ahead and\nedit this document for me as well.\n\n42\n00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.341\nSo even though I own the document its\nself, I could put it into that share,\n\n43\n00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:27.510\nand then Cherokee might also\nbe able to edit that document.\n\n44\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.520\nBut she may not be able to,\n\n45\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.640\nand that might be due to the way\nthat the file share is set up.\n\n46\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.610\nIt might be where I have access to\nthe file share, and I am able to edit,\n\n47\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.780\nI am able to all that, but Cherokee\nmight be able to access that document.\n\n48\n00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.550\nAnd if she wants to edit it,\nshe has to do what?\n\n49\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.110\nDownload that copy to her desktop,\nand so Cherokee, when you do that,\n\n50\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.200\nand you edit that document\nwhen you put it back up there,\n\n51\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.570\nsomething has to change, doesn't it?\n\n52\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.420\n&gt;&gt; Sure,\nwe have to look at those versions and\n\n53\n00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.020\nsee which one has been updated the latest.\n\n54\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nwhen you start taking a look at that,\n\n55\n00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.020\nessentially you end up with two documents,\nokay.\n\n56\n00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.330\nAt least that's the minimum is that\nyou end with with two documents, and\n\n57\n00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.740\nnow we might go back and forth and,\nall of a sudden, I might be looking, and\n\n58\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.000\neven though they might have the same name,\none might have a one after it,\n\n59\n00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.820\nwhatever it might be.\n\n60\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.750\nCuz they don't want to actually name\nthe document the exact same thing.\n\n61\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.900\n&gt;&gt; For those different revisions.\n\n62\n00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.070\n&gt;&gt; Yep, because if I only had a read\nonly where you could access it,\n\n63\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.124\nthe only way that you could edit\nthat is by you downloading it,\n\n64\n00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:28.590\nchanging the ownership of it,\nputting it back up there into my file and\n\n65\n00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.277\nnow essentially we end up\nwith two documents as well.\n\n66\n00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:35.474\nWell collaboration allows us to share\nownership too when we start to take a look\n\n67\n00:03:35.474 --> 00:03:36.440\nat what we can do.\n\n68\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.639\nThe other part of some of the early ways\nthat we might do the collaboration without\n\n69\n00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.963\nsome software tools, like what you're\nmentioning, is just simple, is that they\n\n70\n00:03:44.963 --> 00:03:49.069\nway that I might communication that I\nneed you to edit that is by email, right.\n\n71\n00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.364\nSo here it is, I go here Cherokee\naccess this document email, or\n\n72\n00:03:53.364 --> 00:03:57.112\nhere's an email please go ahead and\ntake a look at this.\n\n73\n00:03:57.112 --> 00:04:01.100\nAnd well, that is now just\nasynchronous communication, right.\n\n74\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.720\nCherokee has to then go and find the\ndocument, has to edit that document, and\n\n75\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.430\nthen put a copy of it back up there and\nthen what do I have to do?\n\n76\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.310\nI need to review that editing,\nI need to take a look and\n\n77\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.540\nsee if any changes were done, and that now\nbecomes a fairly long process, doesn't it?\n\n78\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say,\nit becomes an involved process and\n\n79\n00:04:19.215 --> 00:04:20.955\nreally what we're looking at\nhere is we're talking about,\n\n80\n00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:22.945\nwell how can we improve or\nenhance this process?\n\n81\n00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:24.495\nHow can we streamline it?\n\n82\n00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:25.814\nSo maybe I pull up a document,\n\n83\n00:04:25.814 --> 00:04:29.165\nand I can see those edits that were made\nand maybe even edit it in real-time.\n\n84\n00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:32.165\nSo you see a lot of cool techniques\nthat are being brought into software\n\n85\n00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:32.865\nthese days.\n\n86\n00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:36.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is kinda\nthe wave of the future, right,\n\n87\n00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:39.035\nand even the wave of today as well.\n\n88\n00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:42.365\nBut it's gonna become more and more, so if\nyou're actually moving from that type of\n\n89\n00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.920\nsolution like what I was describing,\nit's not that it doesn't work.\n\n90\n00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.580\nIt's just not really modern, nor\nis it actually really streamlined or\n\n91\n00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.020\nefficient at this point.\n\n92\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.850\nSo one of the things we may\nwant to consider if we're\n\n93\n00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.550\ndoing something like that is to consider\nother alternatives that is out there.\n\n94\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.664\nSo one of the things you may hear about,\nespecially in Office 365,\n\n95\n00:05:02.664 --> 00:05:07.220\nis that there is a collaboration\nsolution called Yammer.\n\n96\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.350\nSo, Cherokee, have you heard of Yammer?\n\n97\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.258\n&gt;&gt; Yammer?\n\n98\n00:05:11.258 --> 00:05:14.540\nYou know what, Ronnie, I used to work for\na company that utilized Yammer,\n\n99\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.660\nbut it wasn't really my favorite\npiece of software to use.\n\n100\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.670\nMaybe you can explain it to our\nviewers in a very appealing way.\n\n101\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.810\nWell I think it's relatively easy, if I'm\nable to use an analogy to make this work.\n\n102\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.150\nIt's sort of like setting\nup a Facebook for\n\n103\n00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.490\nyour own company,\nI think is pretty much the key idea here.\n\n104\n00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.290\nNow you might wonder, why the heck would\nI choose to do anything like that?\n\n105\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.600\n&gt;&gt; Another social media platform,\nsee, that's my stance on it.\n\n106\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.920\nBut, like you said, for\n\n107\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.550\nthat internal communication is\nreally what we're talking about.\n\n108\n00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Right because, well,\nFacebook is out there, and\n\n109\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.070\nit's right out there on the Internet,\nright.\n\n110\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.360\nAnd everybody can gain access,\nand most of the time,\n\n111\n00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.360\nwhat I really need is an opinion\nof somebody inside of the company.\n\n112\n00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.730\nAnd I can put it out there on\nthe Internet to do that, but\n\n113\n00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.970\nthere may be other information\nI don't want that to happen to.\n\n114\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.170\nSo we can set up something\nlike Yammer to help us out.\n\n115\n00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:13.390\nNow there is an unusual situation, so you\nheard Cherokee's initial reaction to this.\n\n116\n00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.820\nAnd what you're gonna find out is that's\nprobably everybody's reaction, okay, too.\n\n117\n00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.980\nAnd the reason why is that\nthe more stuff that we add in,\n\n118\n00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.350\nthe more that we have to at some point,\nright.\n\n119\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.360\nIf it's not just helping\nus to get the meat and\n\n120\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.440\npotatoes of the work that we need done.\n\n121\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.240\nYou have to convince people in a buy in,\nand even though that's not really a part\n\n122\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.980\nof the overall exam itself you're\ngoing to find that out, okay.\n\n123\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.900\nIn a company that may have other\nsolutions which have worked well for\n\n124\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.701\na long time as slow as they are.\n\n125\n00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:44.210\n&gt;&gt; That's how we've always done it,\nRonnie, why do I need Yammer?\n\n126\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.188\n&gt;&gt; That's how we've always done it,\nyeah, and why do we actually need that?\n\n127\n00:06:47.188 --> 00:06:49.980\nAnd thank you for the accent there.\n\n128\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.276\nYeah, so when we start doing\nsomething like this, right you are,\n\n129\n00:06:52.276 --> 00:06:55.150\nyou're gonna have to convince people with\na buy in is what you're gonna have to do.\n\n130\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.470\nBecause they're wondering why\nyou're adding this layer onto it.\n\n131\n00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.300\nWell we're not really adding a layer\nas much as trying to make it a little\n\n132\n00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.320\nmore efficient.\n\n133\n00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.545\nSo Yammer does that for us, it gives\nus the ability to set it up in a way,\n\n134\n00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:09.699\nnot just for social media and\nposting cat pictures,\n\n135\n00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:11.940\nlike Cherokee does on her Facebook.\n\n136\n00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.933\nI'm joking,\nI don't have a clue what she posts.\n\n137\n00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:15.305\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Unicorn pictures,\n\n138\n00:07:15.305 --> 00:07:18.276\nwhatever it might be that\nshe posts on her Facebook.\n\n139\n00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.130\nBut it gives you that way to\nreally have it where it's live and\n\n140\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.170\na social within your company.\n\n141\n00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.460\nSo that means if Cherokee is\nactually on the phone right now,\n\n142\n00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.830\nlet's say that she's a salesperson and\nthat she's on the phone, right now.\n\n143\n00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:38.540\nAnd I need an answer from her, even at\nthe same time as she's on the phone.\n\n144\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.120\nI could just simply send her\na message through the Yammer.\n\n145\n00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.910\nAnd she can just look at it and\nif it's something that she can say yes to,\n\n146\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.380\nshe might just hit the letter y and\npress enter and we're off and going.\n\n147\n00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.329\nSo it can form as an instant\nmessaging if we need it to.\n\n148\n00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:52.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it really doesn't\nhave to be like unicast or\n\n149\n00:07:52.796 --> 00:07:54.320\nsent to one individual person.\n\n150\n00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.585\nIf I post it on to that Yammer, and\nI might have particular groups.\n\n151\n00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:03.540\nYou can create a sales group or completely\nincorporate your entire umbrella there.\n\n152\n00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.070\nAnd say look multiple people\nmay know this answer, so\n\n153\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.280\nI'm just gonna blast it out there and\nwhoever answers me first\n\n154\n00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.120\nthen I can go ahead and respond to this\ncustomer or whomever had that question.\n\n155\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.860\n&gt;&gt; It's really strange right\nwe just try to set it up And\n\n156\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.250\ngo all right, everybody use Yammer.\n\n157\n00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.360\nIt's gonna fail in its adoption.\n\n158\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.940\nAnd this is a relatively\nexpensive venture,\n\n159\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.790\nat least it was when we\nhad only Yammer accounts.\n\n160\n00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.240\nAnd you can actually purchase an only\nYammer account if you want to.\n\n161\n00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.670\nBut it becomes expensive for\n\n162\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.850\neverybody in the business if\nnobody is willing to adopt it.\n\n163\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.840\nYou're paying that monthly\nsubscription And now you really do,\n\n164\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.670\nyou have a Facebook like social media\ninfrastructure so that you can communicate\n\n165\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:48.650\nrelatively easily with other people and\neven share information with other people\n\n166\n00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.430\nvery quickly and maybe even attach\ndocuments to that to share too.\n\n167\n00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.980\nBut when nobody buys into it,\nthat's when it just starts to fall apart.\n\n168\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.020\nThe reason why nobody buys into\nit is they don't see the purpose.\n\n169\n00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.140\nSo the great thing is when you actually\nstart off they always recommend\n\n170\n00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:09.990\nthat the best way to get a collaboration\nsolution is to plan for it.\n\n171\n00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.850\nIs to make sure that you\nunderstand what it's going to do.\n\n172\n00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.310\nAnd this is where you have to understand\nthat even though Yammer, itself,\n\n173\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.800\nis like Facebook, it's not for\nthe same purpose of Facebook, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.060\nSo, this is where Cherokee was\nmentioning creating different groups and\n\n175\n00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.380\ndifferent things that go on.\n\n176\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.450\nBut when it comes down to it,\n\n177\n00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.510\nthe way that you implement\nYammer should be purpose driven.\n\n178\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.080\nOkay?\n\n179\n00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.370\nSo, in that way,\nthere's really six possible solutions\n\n180\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.470\nthat Microsoft says that hey Yammer has\nwin successfully for these companies so\n\n181\n00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.200\nthere is case study out there to help you\nout, but let me kinda mention this, yeah.\n\n182\n00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.980\nLet me kinda mention this and\nthat will help you out,\n\n183\n00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.640\nif your company is now spread out and\ndiverse.\n\n184\n00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.650\nSo let's say your company is within the\nbuilding that's on multiple floors in that\n\n185\n00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.360\nbuilding this will and across halls.\n\n186\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.970\nDown, just long distances away.\n\n187\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.280\nYou can use that as an internal\ncommunications system\n\n188\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.680\njust to have access to that.\n\n189\n00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.260\nNow Cherokee goes, I don't know why\nRonnie is not answering the phone.\n\n190\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.270\nWell, she could walk up three\nflights of stairs then.\n\n191\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.518\n&gt;&gt; And\nfind him sleeping under his desk again.\n\n192\n00:10:12.518 --> 00:10:13.240\n[LAUGH].\n\n193\n00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthat wouldn't be the first time would it?\n\n194\n00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.770\nSo there you go.\n\n195\n00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.850\nAnd so\nwhen something like that happens right,\n\n196\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.320\nwell Yammer might be\na perfect solution for that.\n\n197\n00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.110\nTo be able to have almost\ninstantaneous two-way communication.\n\n198\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.310\nSo it can function as an instant messaging\nbut it at least gives a little bit of time\n\n199\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.250\nfor us to do that,\nregardless of the geography.\n\n200\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:39.570\nOkay, so it can do that for us and\nbe kind of that way that we can then.\n\n201\n00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.690\nAnd it's easy to adopt, because most\npeople that have actually been on Facebook\n\n202\n00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.140\ngo, this is like Facebook.\n\n203\n00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.500\nAnd it works, so\nyou don't have to do a lot of training.\n\n204\n00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.080\nBut you have to get them to buy into that,\nif that's what's gonna happen.\n\n205\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.210\nSo that's one possible\naspect that we can do.\n\n206\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:11:00.050\nThe other one of course is for the idea\nof remote and mobile users as well.\n\n207\n00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:05.360\nAnd what we mean by this is that if let's\nsay that you're a company that also has\n\n208\n00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.600\ncustomers and\nyou have a team of sales as well.\n\n209\n00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.370\nSo like here at ITProTV we\ndon't actually use Yammer.\n\n210\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:17.010\nBut we might have it where if you were\nto call in for technical support.\n\n211\n00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.740\nWell it doesn't mean that you actually\nreach our developers right away.\n\n212\n00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.840\nBut it means that you might\nactually be talking to one of our,\n\n213\n00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.710\nwe're all our member services team.\n\n214\n00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:32.270\nOur member consiariages is what we call\nthem, and what they'll actually do\n\n215\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.830\nis they'll help you out as much as\nthey can when it's dealing with your,\n\n216\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.380\nlet's say you go, I forgot my password.\n\n217\n00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.650\nOkay, so they can help you out with that.\n\n218\n00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.530\nBut what if it's actually a technical\nissue with our website and\n\n219\n00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.390\nit might be a little bit beyond them.\n\n220\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.000\nWell, instead of them literally\nstopping the entire development of our\n\n221\n00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.180\ndevelopment team.\n\n222\n00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.110\nOkay, with a single question.\n\n223\n00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.310\nWhat they might be able to do is say hey,\nlet me see if we can get you answer.\n\n224\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.480\nAnd then use Yammer to essentially type\nout that question, and maybe somebody on\n\n225\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.260\nthe development team, it's their day to\nmonitor that, that will help them out.\n\n226\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.140\nSo it can be used in that way, too,\nwhere it's essentially kind of that bridge\n\n227\n00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:13.540\nbetween you and the true development team,\nwithout having to stop the work of that.\n\n228\n00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.190\nSo it is possible there, too.\n\n229\n00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.690\nRight, so if I had a message,\n\n230\n00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.730\nsending an e-mail and I was maybe one\nof those customer, what did you say?\n\n231\n00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.500\nConcierge.\n\n232\n00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I go ahead and\n\n233\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.970\nsend a direct e-mail to someone\nin the development team.\n\n234\n00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.450\nI don't need to wait for\nteam to seek through their e-mails.\n\n235\n00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.270\nI might be like tenth in queue for\nthem to respond to those e-mails.\n\n236\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.360\nWhereas I have a chance of having a more\n\n237\n00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.560\nof rapid response by\nutilizing a tool like Yammer.\n\n238\n00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.840\nIt really can it can help at least\nin those situations very quickly.\n\n239\n00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.010\nEspecially if all of sudden all\nthey really need to do was reboot.\n\n240\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.410\nThe guy says just tell them to try and\nlaunch it in a different browser.\n\n241\n00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.810\nWell if the concierge is not let's\nsay that they're brand new and\n\n242\n00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.470\nthey haven't gone through everything.\n\n243\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.770\nBut we're trying to get them\nacclimated to the situation.\n\n244\n00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:01.300\nIt might just help that they have somebody\nthat can just type that kind of here step\n\n245\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.580\nby step what needs to be done very quickly\nand that way we can help them out as well.\n\n246\n00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.174\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and instead of sitting into\nthat one individual just broadcast\n\n247\n00:13:09.174 --> 00:13:10.663\n&gt;&gt; Saying it to the entire development\n\n248\n00:13:10.663 --> 00:13:12.648\ngroup through Yammer\nthrough a group there, so\n\n249\n00:13:12.648 --> 00:13:14.842\nyou're not just relying\non one individual person.\n\n250\n00:13:14.842 --> 00:13:18.715\n&gt;&gt; A third way to also do this is HR.\n\n251\n00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:22.565\nEspecially in on boarding\nprocess of a lot companies.\n\n252\n00:13:22.565 --> 00:13:27.715\nAs more and more people get on boarded\nthey tend to follow the same process\n\n253\n00:13:27.715 --> 00:13:31.630\nusually in the first two or three days\n&gt;&gt; You have to kinda fill out forums,\n\n254\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.900\nyou've gotta kind of go through\nmaybe even a personality test.\n\n255\n00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.944\n&gt;&gt; Some kind of training, yeah.\n\n256\n00:13:36.944 --> 00:13:41.112\n&gt;&gt; And the training, it might be worthy\nyou have to schedule that training and\n\n257\n00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:45.250\nbecause the person is not there for\na week or whatever it might be.\n\n258\n00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.710\nWell, what if you could actually do part\nof that on boarding process itself through\n\n259\n00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.750\nHR using the Yammer that's\nactually out there so\n\n260\n00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.490\nthat you can directly communicate with\nwhoever that training partner is.\n\n261\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.830\nWhat you might have to do,\nwhat forms have to be filled out, and\n\n262\n00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.800\nthat way it's actually out there and\nit's available for you.\n\n263\n00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.860\nSo HR may actually be a good\ninstance of you going yes,\n\n264\n00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.110\nYammer's a good solution for us as well.\n\n265\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.300\nAlso product innovation teams too.\n\n266\n00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.900\nProduct innovations rarely happen\njust within a single company.\n\n267\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.295\nSo you might find out that\nyou have partner companies.\n\n268\n00:14:20.295 --> 00:14:24.400\nITPro.TV has partner companies,\nwe have practice labs that we work with.\n\n269\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.340\nWe have other companies that we work\nwith to help develop like our mobile\n\n270\n00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.390\napps and stuff.\n\n271\n00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.590\nSo all that might actually be\nsomething where we use Yammer\n\n272\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.090\nthat gives us that direct communication\nbetween our development team and\n\n273\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.880\nother development teams that are out there\nhelping us to develop that mobile app.\n\n274\n00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.100\nOr if we have issues with\nour practice labs right?\n\n275\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.050\nWhere instead of me going well just shoot\nan email over to the practice labs guys.\n\n276\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.940\nBut if we had Yammer set up\nthere where we could just say,\n\n277\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.240\nall right,\nlet's see what we can do to help out here.\n\n278\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.890\nAnd there we are, we are now\nhaving that communication process.\n\n279\n00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:00.520\nSo when innovation happens, such as people\ndeveloping new products, stuff like that,\n\n280\n00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.760\nand we are geographically diverse, it\nmay help to have the ability to do that.\n\n281\n00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.640\nInstead of having to schedule\njust a once a week phone call or\n\n282\n00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.550\na daily phone call to do this we can\nhave that live time collaboration.\n\n283\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.820\nCuz it might be where, let's say for\ninstance Thomas is just waiting on\n\n284\n00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.170\nan answer from one of our other partners\nout there, but he as to wait for\n\n285\n00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.520\nan email to come back.\n\n286\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.970\nAnd it might have just been something\nsimple where he could have said,\n\n287\n00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.380\nlet me just type this in and\nhe'll understand it.\n\n288\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.660\nAnd be off and going.\n\n289\n00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.770\nAnd so we can do stuff like\nthat if we choose to, okay?\n\n290\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.150\nAnd of course sales is a big one too.\n\n291\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.490\nThe idea of us being able of course to\nbring you the content that we want to.\n\n292\n00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.520\nWe also of course connect to companies,\nand if a company says, look,\n\n293\n00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.096\nI have 10,000 users, which we'd love\nto have of course That wanna sign up.\n\n294\n00:15:48.096 --> 00:15:52.252\nWell it might be where they ask for\na particular volume discount, and\n\n295\n00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:55.521\nwhoever are-\n&gt;&gt; You may need approval to go ahead and\n\n296\n00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:56.834\nissue that discount.\n\n297\n00:15:56.834 --> 00:15:59.792\nTo say yes we'll definitely\ndo something like that.\n\n298\n00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:03.926\nSo that may actually be a good solution\nwithout interrupting while he is on\n\n299\n00:16:03.926 --> 00:16:06.010\nthe phone with the customer.\n\n300\n00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.750\nThe approval side, the management side can\ntake over and say yes this is what we need\n\n301\n00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.660\nto do if we're gonna do something\nlike this and give the information\n\n302\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:18.210\non the screen while they are still\ntalking which is also a great aspect.\n\n303\n00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:23.320\nAnd of course the idea of being\nthe IT Communications System\n\n304\n00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.650\nis also a good one for\ninternal support as well.\n\n305\n00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.890\nThe very fact that you're\nnot relying on one team.\n\n306\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.410\nIt could be somebody assigned that\nday to actually monitor that system\n\n307\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.960\nand there it is.\n\n308\n00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.730\nThey go to the Yammer group\nthat's set up for IT.\n\n309\n00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:42.000\nAnd they need help, they might go to\nget it instantly right there too And\n\n310\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.910\nit allows a person to be able\nto multitask and continue on.\n\n311\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.220\nSo those are kind of the six solutions\nyou can find on Microsoft's site.\n\n312\n00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.960\nWhen they talk about making\nYammer purpose driven.\n\n313\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.555\nSo these are kind of the most successful\nstories that they have heard about.\n\n314\n00:16:57.555 --> 00:17:01.810\nAt the beginning of [INAUDIBLE],\nI said this,\n\n315\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.180\nthat if you just try and do this, in other\nwords, say, we're gonna use Yammer, and\n\n316\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.220\njust put it out there,\nit's not going to be successful.\n\n317\n00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.860\nPeople are already social media savvy, and\nthey don't know why they need to keep up\n\n318\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.800\nwith another one, especially if it's\njust internally inside of the company.\n\n319\n00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.510\nSo they tend not to use it why because\nwhat we said earlier those systems that\n\n320\n00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.810\nalready in place we like those we\ndon't tend to actually adopt them.\n\n321\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.540\nBut if you can show the specific purpose\nof it, they're probably more than likely\n\n322\n00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.690\nto adopt it that's actually better\nthan the way that they've had before.\n\n323\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.570\nAnd Ryan,\nthat's just about with everything, right?\n\n324\n00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.150\nWhenever we're trying to obtain\nthat buy in, communication is key.\n\n325\n00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.390\nIf people understand why\nyou're implementing something,\n\n326\n00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.350\nthey're more receptive\nto actually relieve or\n\n327\n00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.400\nremove that resistance that\nsometimes we may face.\n\n328\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.990\nIt's just kind of human nature,\npeople don't like to change, right?\n\n329\n00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.620\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's pretty much the key.\n\n330\n00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.620\nSo once you get that, once you go\nall right, we're going to do this.\n\n331\n00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.430\nThere is just a couple of things\nyou have to do to get it set up.\n\n332\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.940\nThe great thing is,\neverything is kind of set up.\n\n333\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.680\nIt's really easy.\n\n334\n00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.190\nIt's turned on and you don't really\nhave to worry about too much, but\n\n335\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.280\nthere are some things you have\nto pay attention to here.\n\n336\n00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.530\nSo, at the very beginning, you're going\nto find out as far as the exam goes,\n\n337\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.130\nthere's a couple of terms\nyou need to find out about.\n\n338\n00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.830\nOnce you have the subscriptions\nthat allow you to use Yammer you're\n\n339\n00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.630\ngonna have to set up what they\ncall a verified administrator,\n\n340\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.500\nkeep that term in your mind.\n\n341\n00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.470\nAnd that is actually gonna be\nadministrator that is pretty much in\n\n342\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:27.560\ncontrol of Yammer.\n\n343\n00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.990\nLet me show you what I'm\ntalking about here okay.\n\n344\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:34.190\nSo here on my machine I'm logged in\nas a global administrator of our\n\n345\n00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.100\nOffice 365 account.\n\n346\n00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.320\nWhich is Joey Fatone here.\n\n347\n00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:42.480\nI'm going to click on admin and what we\ngonna do is we gonna fo the Yammer admin\n\n348\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.620\npage at the very beginning here\nis what we are going to do.\n\n349\n00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:52.170\nAnd then I'm gonna scroll\ndown to admin centers and\n\n350\n00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.610\nclick once then look for Yammer.\n\n351\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:05.350\nAnd inside of Yammer,\nnotice right here it says verified admin.\n\n352\n00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.920\nThey are the top of the hierarchy\nin terms of Yammer.\n\n353\n00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.530\nNow, it's strange,\n\n354\n00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.720\neverybody else uses the term network\nadmins for kind of the top here.\n\n355\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.400\nOr system admins, but overall,\nthis is the term they chose to use.\n\n356\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.390\nYou can create another admin if you choose\nto and it doesn't mean they have to\n\n357\n00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.750\nbe a verified admin but\nit does give you that ability to do so.\n\n358\n00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.750\nThe other one is a network admin.\n\n359\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.230\nAnd network admin means that you are also\nable to create groups if you want to.\n\n360\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.350\nSo this guy is pretty much in\nessentially the administrator,\n\n361\n00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.340\nthe global administrator inside of Yammer.\n\n362\n00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.890\nSo if you wanted to add another admin.\n\n363\n00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.130\nYou can actually do that as well,\n\n364\n00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.550\nwhere you can actually\ncreate another global admin.\n\n365\n00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.280\nBut for us we're not gonna\nworry about it for right now.\n\n366\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.170\nBut just make sure you understand\nthat it has to begin with\n\n367\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.220\nthe actual verified admin.\n\n368\n00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:00.230\nNow in theory, the global admin also,\nthe one that actually\n\n369\n00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:04.860\nIs kind of owning the overall site itself,\n\n370\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.500\nthe tenant Joey Fatone,\nhe's one of the global admins.\n\n371\n00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.910\nHe also is a verified admin as well.\n\n372\n00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.790\nBut you can reassign it and\nthat's what we have here too, okay?\n\n373\n00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.830\nAre you limited to the number of admins,\n\n374\n00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.950\nor how should we really approach that,\nRonny?\n\n375\n00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can be limited but\nyou don't have to be.\n\n376\n00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.750\nSo you can actually have an admin for\n\n377\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.810\neach group if you want to,\nthat you end up creating.\n\n378\n00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.930\nAnd that way they are the ones that\nare in control of that group, but\n\n379\n00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.360\nit doesn't necessarily\nhave to be that way.\n\n380\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.210\nIf you only want one person to create\nthose groups you only make one admin.\n\n381\n00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.540\nSo if you want multiple\ngroups to be there, and\n\n382\n00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.840\nthere are limitations to the number\nof groups you can create.\n\n383\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.810\nAnd I can't remember off the top of\nmy head how many that is overall.\n\n384\n00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.980\n&gt;&gt; They're probably pretty generous as\nfar as what I've seen in other platforms.\n\n385\n00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as far as I remember.\n\n386\n00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.920\nBut I can't remember\nthe exact number there.\n\n387\n00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.260\nBut it's a certain number\nthat there's a maximum to it.\n\n388\n00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:01.140\nSo you can have a network admin that is\ngoing to be able to create groups and\n\n389\n00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.540\nto manage that group and to invite people\ninto that group, and do all that stuff.\n\n390\n00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.230\nOr you can just leave it at\none person who can create and\n\n391\n00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.100\ndo everything if you choose to.\n\n392\n00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.630\nSo, right there is kind of\njust about all that you do.\n\n393\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.420\nSo take a look once again on the screen,\nand\n\n394\n00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.600\nthere's not really a lot\nhere in this admin center.\n\n395\n00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.350\nYou can see as I hover over,\nit has my groups here and\n\n396\n00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.280\nthat's how they're normal divided up.\n\n397\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.259\nAnd this is the whole company,\nif I click on discover more groups.\n\n398\n00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.890\nIt will change and\nnow you can kind of see what it\n\n399\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.970\nsays hey more groups there isn't\nany other group well if I now say\n\n400\n00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:45.605\nwe only gonna have Justin Timberlake\nhere as being on or Joey being on one.\n\n401\n00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:49.360\nAnd he wants to create new group he\nsimply clicks on create a new group and\n\n402\n00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.080\nthis is when we need to decide whether\nwe're going to create what we call\n\n403\n00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.530\nan internal group or\nan external group as well, okay?\n\n404\n00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.480\nNow when you do this, internal groups,\n\n405\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.470\nnotice people inside are at our own Office\n365 tendency is what you're talking about.\n\n406\n00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.590\nBut you can also collaborate with\npeople with other companies.\n\n407\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.410\nYou wanna make that very\nclear distinctive line.\n\n408\n00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.500\nOf what groups are actually out there.\n\n409\n00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.820\nAnd you want to limit that idea\nof the number of groups because\n\n410\n00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.730\nwhat can end up happening is\nwhat we call sprawl, right?\n\n411\n00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.940\nThe very fact is you may have people\n\n412\n00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.890\nthat are a part of both of\nthese two different groups.\n\n413\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.070\nA single individual.\n\n414\n00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.300\nPart of both groups and\n\n415\n00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.990\nthey accidentally post stuff that\nshould be in the internal group.\n\n416\n00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Aye, yeah.\n\n417\n00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.060\n&gt;&gt; They accidentally posted\nit in the external group.\n\n418\n00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.160\nSo it's not recommended,\nnot that you can't do it,\n\n419\n00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.250\nbut you wanna make sure that everybody\nunderstands the clear distinction and\n\n420\n00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.160\nwhoever the administrator\nis of that group.\n\n421\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.940\nIf you choose to do that way,\nthat they understand what the rules are.\n\n422\n00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.020\nSo this is why setting it up, buying in.\n\n423\n00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.650\nWhoever's gonna be creating this\nneeds to understand the rules so\n\n424\n00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.630\nyou also wanna make sure you\nset up rules for these groups.\n\n425\n00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.250\nAnd what can be put in there and\nwhat should be put in there as well.\n\n426\n00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.180\n&gt;&gt; I think their group name would\nprobably be pretty important as well.\n\n427\n00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.780\nI mean you wouldn't wanna\nhave some kind of very\n\n428\n00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.560\ninsignificant variation especially if you\nwere talking internal versus external.\n\n429\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.580\nYou'd wanna kind of make it super obvious.\n\n430\n00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n431\n00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.580\nthat's something that is recommended\nas far as the best practice goes right?\n\n432\n00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.210\nThe very fact is that the name should\nalso include the purpose of the group.\n\n433\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:22.040\nSo for example, if it's HR, you might\nput HR as a prefix at the beginning or\n\n434\n00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.730\nmaybe even the suffix, right?\n\n435\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.730\nSo it might be HR, third floor,\nwhatever it might be, okay?\n\n436\n00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.900\nOr it might be HR, company.\n\n437\n00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.450\nIt might be something like that.\n\n438\n00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.880\nAnd the same thing with external group,\nyou might wanna put E-X-T at the beginning\n\n439\n00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.050\nof it so that everybody understands that\nthis is an external group member, okay?\n\n440\n00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:43.360\nNow there's also one other thing that I\nwant us to take a look at from right here.\n\n441\n00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.658\nAnd we'll actually create some, but\nI'm starting to run out of time but\n\n442\n00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:49.485\nI want to kind of review just\na couple of things before we do so.\n\n443\n00:23:49.485 --> 00:23:52.220\nSo we'll create a name here in a moment.\n\n444\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.850\nTake a look at the group members,\nnotice how easy it is for someone.\n\n445\n00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.982\nIf you now make someone an admin inside\nof Yammer, they can create these groups.\n\n446\n00:23:59.982 --> 00:24:02.360\nIt doesn't always have to\nbe the verified admin.\n\n447\n00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.090\nIt can be one of the admins\nthat you set up.\n\n448\n00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.210\nSo you can do it by either\ntheir name inside of your\n\n449\n00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.270\nOffice 365 account or the email.\n\n450\n00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:17.380\nAnd notice that there's also public and\nprivate access here.\n\n451\n00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.430\nPublic means anyone in the network can\nview the conversation and posts, and\n\n452\n00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.150\nthat is across the entire domain.\n\n453\n00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:25.910\nSo if you just want to post\na question out there for\n\n454\n00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.980\neverybody in your company,\nit might be something like that.\n\n455\n00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.380\nSo just for example,\nCherokee says I'm buying drinks for\n\n456\n00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.080\neverybody at 5 o'clock on Friday, today.\n\n457\n00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.820\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n\n458\n00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.770\nAnd she wants to extend that\nout to the whole company,\n\n459\n00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.720\nwell, that would be a public access.\n\n460\n00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.240\nIf she only wanted to invite her closest\nfriends in the private group, well,\n\n461\n00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.470\nshe might just go ahead and\njust make this private access only.\n\n462\n00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:51.370\nWhich means only people in that group\nwould also be able to do so, as well.\n\n463\n00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.250\nSo it gives you that ability to do this.\n\n464\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:59.338\nSo if I were to choose HR-training\nto actually stay with.\n\n465\n00:24:59.338 --> 00:25:02.810\nAnd then I'm simply going to add\nin the other member inside of my\n\n466\n00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.890\nnetwork right now which is,\nI think Lance is kind of the other guy.\n\n467\n00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:16.578\nSo Officeprodemoco.onmicrosoft If I\ncan spell it .com.\n\n468\n00:25:16.578 --> 00:25:23.060\nI'm going to make this instead of public,\nwhich it was, I select private right here.\n\n469\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:28.280\nPrivate access only group members\ncan view the conversation and post.\n\n470\n00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.840\nList this group in our network directory,\nand\n\n471\n00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.510\nlet's see what happens\nwhen I create the group.\n\n472\n00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.110\nFrom right there,\nit's actually saying all right,\n\n473\n00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.330\nso here it gives me the ability to invite,\ninstead.\n\n474\n00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.790\nSo it didn't like me\nactually posting it there.\n\n475\n00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.429\nSo we'll try it again this time.\n\n476\n00:25:42.429 --> 00:25:48.080\nAt Office Pro, there we go.\n\n477\n00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.980\nSo now, notice that even though the first\ntime, it kind of just gave me the ability\n\n478\n00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.410\nto write it in,\nit really didn't like what I did.\n\n479\n00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:59.300\nSo now I'm gonna add to Group here, and\n\n480\n00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.460\nnow Lance has actually\nbeen added to the group.\n\n481\n00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.446\nSo there we go.\n\n482\n00:26:03.446 --> 00:26:08.290\nIt says, if you've invited people to\nthis group who haven't used Yammer yet.\n\n483\n00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.880\nThey won't appear in the list until\nthey activate their Yammer account.\n\n484\n00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.440\nAnd this is the neat thing, right?\n\n485\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.230\nIt's gonna essentially send them an email\nand now they'll be activated and\n\n486\n00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:21.840\nthey'll be able to get access to\nthis particular group as well, okay?\n\n487\n00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.690\nSo once that's actually done,\nthat's what you'll see.\n\n488\n00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.280\nAnd here it is.\n\n489\n00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.430\nHere's that new group that was created.\n\n490\n00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.260\nAnd you can see over here\non the right hand side.\n\n491\n00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.670\nWhere there is two members of it Joey and\n\n492\n00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.170\nthen the next one is awaiting\nthe member is what's happening here.\n\n493\n00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.150\nAnd that's why because we\nhaven't clicked on it either.\n\n494\n00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.340\n&gt;&gt; Like that invitation still pending.\n\n495\n00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.980\n&gt;&gt; Yep it's still actually, out there and\nat this point we can check,\n\n496\n00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:50.240\nbut we've gotta do a couple of\nother things before we do that So\n\n497\n00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.480\nI wanted at least to show\nyou where you can see this.\n\n498\n00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.820\nNotice also the lock up here, okay?\n\n499\n00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.860\nWhich tells you that this\ngroup is a private group and\n\n500\n00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.800\nonly members can view or\nparticipate in it.\n\n501\n00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.790\nSo here you can have files,\nnotes, create a new conversation,\n\n502\n00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:11.660\nshare something with the entire group You\ncan create a poll, make announcements.\n\n503\n00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.500\nAll of these are very good things for\nyour group.\n\n504\n00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.700\nEspecially if it's like\nthis HR training here.\n\n505\n00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.530\nYou might be posting like,\nhere's when the next training session for\n\n506\n00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.530\nthis particular thing to happen.\n\n507\n00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.530\nAnd that way, everybody gets access to it.\n\n508\n00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.360\nEspecially if it's a new group here.\n\n509\n00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.400\nNow there's only one other\nthing I want to show.\n\n510\n00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.510\nFor the planning of this too.\n\n511\n00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:35.290\nCause the idea of you joining Yammer and\nusing it is not that difficult.\n\n512\n00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.742\nYou click on the link and it says\nyou've been accepted in this group and\n\n513\n00:27:38.742 --> 00:27:39.923\nyou'll be ready to go.\n\n514\n00:27:39.923 --> 00:27:40.626\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie,\n\n515\n00:27:40.626 --> 00:27:43.750\nyou mentioned that the interface is\nkind og a similar format to Facebook.\n\n516\n00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:48.250\nAnd it really is, it's just trying\nto create that more natural flow so\n\n517\n00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.430\nyou don't have to learn a\n&gt;&gt; A new product from the ground up there.\n\n518\n00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you really will.\n\n519\n00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.730\nYou'll start seeing that as people\nstart posting these messages,\n\n520\n00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:00.480\nit would just line up here and\nit should look Facebook like,\n\n521\n00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.100\nI should say,\nis what should end up happening.\n\n522\n00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:08.210\nBut there is more setting, which is very\nimportant if you're gonna set this up.\n\n523\n00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:13.779\nYammer by itself is not turned\non by default in Office 365.\n\n524\n00:28:13.779 --> 00:28:18.532\nAnd what that means is that what is used\nas kinda the social collaboration thing\n\n525\n00:28:18.532 --> 00:28:23.440\nright now is really part of a news\nfeed inside of SharePoint itself.\n\n526\n00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.220\nSo if you want to turn on Yammer you're\ngoing to find something out that's\n\n527\n00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.800\na little bit harder to understand.\n\n528\n00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.450\nLet me show you here\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n529\n00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:35.500\nAnd we'll end at least this\nsegment here with this.\n\n530\n00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.170\nSo inside of Yammer,\nif I select the Yammer admin page again,\n\n531\n00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:44.580\nwe wanna turn on Yammer is what we\nwanna do for out entire organization.\n\n532\n00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:49.150\nWell even inside of the Yammer admin page,\nokay.\n\n533\n00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.710\nYou would go through\nwhere it says success and\n\n534\n00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.470\nyou would simply follow\nthe steps right here.\n\n535\n00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:58.230\nGo through the check Azure user,\nset your usage policies,\n\n536\n00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:02.700\nyou do this When you create that initial\ngroup, that usage policy, it will tell you\n\n537\n00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:07.120\nhere's all the stuff you need to read,\nwelcome message, you can set all that up.\n\n538\n00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.480\nAnd it works like a dream once\nyou get it set up, except for\n\n539\n00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.050\nthe very first time when it's\nnot actually turned on, okay?\n\n540\n00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:20.060\nSo, the weird thing is, Cherokee,\nas I looked through this list briefly\n\n541\n00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:24.740\nyou would think that there would be\nlike a big gigantic on button somewhere.\n\n542\n00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.130\nBut it is not here.\n\n543\n00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.840\nAnd how do I know that?\n\n544\n00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:34.020\nBecause I've clicked on\nevery single one of these.\n\n545\n00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:38.846\nIt's not on anywhere [CROSSTALK] So,\nyeah, this is where it becomes tricky.\n\n546\n00:29:38.846 --> 00:29:42.084\n[CROSSTALK] You would think\nthe little gear, right?\n\n547\n00:29:42.084 --> 00:29:42.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n548\n00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.720\n&gt;&gt; But no.\n\n549\n00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.155\nOffice 365 Settings and Change Theme.\n\n550\n00:29:46.155 --> 00:29:48.350\n&gt;&gt; What about the gear to the left?\n\n551\n00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.630\n&gt;&gt; The gear to left you would\nthink would be here, too.\n\n552\n00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.960\nBut no, he can invite, make groups,\npeople, files, apps, network admin.\n\n553\n00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.710\nThat actually shows with\na little star by the admin.\n\n554\n00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.210\nWe can create and browse,\neven external networks.\n\n555\n00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.480\nWe can do all that.\n\n556\n00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.280\nIt doesn't give you that\nability to turn it on.\n\n557\n00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.340\nSo where do you go?\n\n558\n00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.960\nYeah that's exactly the key here.\n\n559\n00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.150\nWell believe it or\nnot where you have to go is SharePoint.\n\n560\n00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.800\nI mean who would have guessed\nthat that's where you have to go.\n\n561\n00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.740\n&gt;&gt; Interesting okay.\n\n562\n00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:18.630\n&gt;&gt; So let me show you this because\nthis is kind of one of the unusual\n\n563\n00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:23.150\nthings about this\n&gt;&gt; So as I go back out to the Admin tile,\n\n564\n00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.390\nand hopefully it's switching.\n\n565\n00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.730\nMaybe I didn't click on it, there we go.\n\n566\n00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.135\nI love those tabs.\n\n567\n00:30:31.135 --> 00:30:32.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna have so many of them,\n\n568\n00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.740\nit's gonna be amazing.\n\n569\n00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:40.603\nSo once I get here, I'm gonna scroll down,\nselect Admin Centers And\n\n570\n00:30:40.603 --> 00:30:46.740\nthen instead of Yammer, which I was about\nto go to again, I select SharePoint.\n\n571\n00:30:48.175 --> 00:30:52.610\nOoh I lost my trackpad for\none reason or another.\n\n572\n00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:56.920\nInside of the SharePoint Admin Center,\nif I scroll down,\n\n573\n00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.750\nI'm going to look for Settings.\n\n574\n00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.300\nApparently it connected again,\nweird, okay.\n\n575\n00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:09.810\nSettings, and inside of Settings,\nIf you scroll down toward!\n\n576\n00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.910\n&gt;&gt; Just kind of buried-\n&gt;&gt; Right there, it is kind of buried.\n\n577\n00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:18.500\nBut now notice,\nEnterprise Social Collaboration.\n\n578\n00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.770\nRight now, what is turned on is\nUse SharePoint feed by default.\n\n579\n00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:29.360\nIf I want to use Yammer as the main\nsocial collaboration feature,\n\n580\n00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.820\nand not the SharePoint feed,\nI have to actually mark this right here,\n\n581\n00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.260\nand it might take up the 30 minutes for\nit to complete.\n\n582\n00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.278\nThat's because it has to change it\nglobally, it has to change it in\n\n583\n00:31:41.278 --> 00:31:44.678\nSharePoint, throughout the entire\nsystem here for that to end up working.\n\n584\n00:31:44.678 --> 00:31:48.180\nWe're not so worried about as much\nas you know where to turn it on.\n\n585\n00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.280\nNow this also gives you the ability\nif one day you go, look,\n\n586\n00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.260\nnobody's really using it,\nI don't wanna pay for the feature anymore.\n\n587\n00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.360\nAll you have to do is you come here,\nand you turn it off.\n\n588\n00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.450\nThe great thing is,\nif you've been using SharePoint news feed,\n\n589\n00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.450\npeople always ask questions like,\ndo I lose any information?\n\n590\n00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.310\nYou don't.\n\n591\n00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.580\nYou don't lose any information,\nonce you turn it off, but\n\n592\n00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.400\nat the same time,\nit will keep it in the background.\n\n593\n00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.540\nBut it does take about a half\nhour to actually turn on and\n\n594\n00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.078\nto do more if you're doing this.\n\n595\n00:32:15.078 --> 00:32:16.310\nSo be careful.\n\n596\n00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.280\n&gt;&gt; What are the big differences\nbetween the SharePoint\n\n597\n00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.160\nnews feed versus the Yammer, I mean, why\nwould I choose to use one or the other?\n\n598\n00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.550\n&gt;&gt; Remember that news feed is just\ngoing to be exactly what we have\n\n599\n00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.770\ninside of the news reader.\n\n600\n00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.910\nIt shows data as it's coming across,\nbut it doesn't give you\n\n601\n00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:37.200\nthe conversational feature that you would\nhave in live time communication and that.\n\n602\n00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.610\nYou can still have the collaboration\nwhere you share and where you can modify,\n\n603\n00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:44.155\nand edit documents, and\ncreate them, co-owner.\n\n604\n00:32:44.155 --> 00:32:47.190\nCo-author them, you name it and\nyou can still do that.\n\n605\n00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:52.540\nBut with Yammer though, you actually add\nin that kind of communication feature,\n\n606\n00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.550\nis what you're doing.\n\n607\n00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:57.330\nTo make it more alive and\nto make it more social media like instead.\n\n608\n00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.360\nIs what you have the ability to do.\n\n609\n00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.930\nSo Yammer itself, it is a good product.\n\n610\n00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.330\nIf you begin with it.\n\n611\n00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:07.230\nBut if you don't begin with it, right,\nit means the buy-in is very important for\n\n612\n00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.250\nyour company.\n\n613\n00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.950\nBut at least those things, right?\n\n614\n00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.340\nMake sure you know where to turn on\nthis Enterprise Social Collaboration.\n\n615\n00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.060\nAnd understand that if\nyou're gonna create a group,\n\n616\n00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.470\nyou'll probably have to be an admin to\ncreate the group to do what you want to.\n\n617\n00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:24.950\nAnd then, from that point all you do is\nyou invite members and they are off and\n\n618\n00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:25.720\nthey are ready to go, but\n\n619\n00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.900\nif they are gonna be using Yammer,\nthis has to be enabled for\n\n620\n00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.210\nthem to do so, if they're not, well\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n621\n00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.880\nWell, it still show up in Yammer, yes, but\n\n622\n00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.660\nnot everybody will actually end up using\nas their main feature, because this\n\n623\n00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.530\nwatch as you turn it on, so only a few\nwhere invited in Yammer when we use it.\n\n624\n00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:45.832\nBut here if you want this to become\nthe default, that's what you have to do.\n\n625\n00:33:45.832 --> 00:33:49.460\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie, we are just about out\nof time for this episode but weve really\n\n626\n00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.925\njust scraped the surface of the different\ncollaboration tool we have available.\n\n627\n00:33:53.925 --> 00:33:57.405\nSo thank you for joining us and thank you,\nladies and gentlemen, for joining as well.\n\n628\n00:33:57.405 --> 00:33:59.985\nBut stay tuned because we have\nmore information headed your way.\n\n629\n00:33:59.985 --> 00:34:01.615\nLet me go ahead and sign out.\n\n630\n00:34:01.615 --> 00:34:03.445\nAs your host, remember,\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n631\n00:34:03.445 --> 00:34:04.255\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.305\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:13.030\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\n\n5\n00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.450\nenabling Office 365 series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.720\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.960\nIn the previous episode we really\nspent a lot of time focusing on\n\n8\n00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.260\nYammer which is a collaboration tool.\n\n9\n00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.100\nIn this show, we'll look at and\nexplore additional collaboration tools.\n\n10\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.040\nAnd with us today, back in the studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.210\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back,\n\n13\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.670\nas we take a look at more of these\ndifferent ways that we can collaborate.\n\n14\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.184\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what is the first tool\nthat we'll be looking at in this show?\n\n15\n00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:47.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes down to what\nwe really need to look at right now,\n\n16\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.600\nis the ability to do the idea of editing,\nof authoring.\n\n17\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.150\nBut instead of just one person authoring,\n\n18\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.300\nwe're now talking about multiple\npeople being able to do it,\n\n19\n00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.830\nwe'll call co-authoring is what\nwe're taking a look at here.\n\n20\n00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.170\nSo, when we start to do that we\nhave to understand that particular\n\n21\n00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.880\nconcept as well.\n\n22\n00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.600\nSo, in the previous episode I mentioned\nthat one of the ways we tend to do\n\n23\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.269\ncollaboration without all\nthese tools is simple.\n\n24\n00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:17.331\nWe might just have a file share and\nfrom that point, I might edit it,\n\n25\n00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:19.753\nbut you might also be able to edit it, but\n\n26\n00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:23.350\nonly if you actually kind of\ntake advantage of that to do so.\n\n27\n00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.250\nAnd then, when you try to put it back,\n\n28\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.800\nit will end up creating a duplicate\nfile of what we normally see.\n\n29\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.420\n&gt;&gt; Now, when you hear that term,\nco-authoring, I can assume that it\n\n30\n00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.070\nmeans more than one author or owner, but I\ndon't wanna go ahead and assume anything.\n\n31\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.950\nSo, can you expand on\nthat a little bit and\n\n32\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.610\nlet me know if there's anything I\nshould know about co-authoring?\n\n33\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.750\n&gt;&gt; It really is about that\nidea of being able to make\n\n34\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.620\nthat document have essentially\ntwo owners to the document.\n\n35\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.720\nBut at the same time, also be able to edit\nthe document instead of one at a time,\n\n36\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.830\nso it's not asynchronous\nhere where I write.\n\n37\n00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.270\nCherokee edits it then, I go and\nread the revisions here.\n\n38\n00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.010\nI disagree with a revision and\nI send it back to Cherokee.\n\n39\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.180\nCherokee makes the edit or\nchanges it back or whatever it is.\n\n40\n00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.350\nAnd then, I go and\nchange something else and\n\n41\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.070\nthen, Cherokee reviews it and\ncomes back here.\n\n42\n00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.960\nBut it gives us the chance,\ndepending on how we have it set up\n\n43\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.240\nto where we might be working on\nthe document exactly at the same time,\n\n44\n00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.860\nwhich does kind of bring up,\nit's gotta be some conflicts, right?\n\n45\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.530\nSo, for example, if all of a sudden\nCherokee and I spot the exact same work\n\n46\n00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.370\nand this is hypothetical, of course,\nin let's say a Word document.\n\n47\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.890\nAnd she decides to change it to this Word\nand I decide to change it to that Word,\n\n48\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.990\nwell, which one at that point actually\ntakes over and takes precedent,\n\n49\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.990\nis what we're really talking about here.\n\n50\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.260\nAnd that's where it becomes a little bit\nharder, depending on what we're doing.\n\n51\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.930\nThe great thing about doing something\nlike co-authoring is that as Cherokee\n\n52\n00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.120\nmarks what she wants to change and\nwhat normally ends up happening here,\n\n53\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.350\nis that I can actually see where\nshe might be deleting a word, and\n\n54\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.940\nit actually has her name beside it.\n\n55\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.360\nAnd that way I go, I better not mess with\nthat right now, let me go ahead and take\n\n56\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.450\na look, or she might delete out a sentence\nand actually retype a new sentence in.\n\n57\n00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.100\nAnd that let's me know that she\nis working on the document too.\n\n58\n00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.930\nSo, in terms of co-authoring,\nthere's really\n\n59\n00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.260\ntwo different types of co-authoring\nthat we're really interested in.\n\n60\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.257\nAnd one of them is what we\ncall regular co-authoring.\n\n61\n00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:29.740\nRegular co-authoring, it's going to sound\na little bit strange, but here is the key.\n\n62\n00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.620\nRegular co-authoring allows us\nboth to connect to the document\n\n63\n00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.230\nthat's normally stored on\na shared folder location, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.460\nFor us, that would be One Drive or\n\n65\n00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.030\nSharePoint collection,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n66\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.660\nAnd we both can connect to\nthat at the very same time.\n\n67\n00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.720\nWe both can actually provide\nedits at the same time, but\n\n68\n00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.240\nthe actual edits are only\nseen when you hit save.\n\n69\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.000\nSo, that's where it becomes a little bit\ntricky, we both have to be doing that.\n\n70\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.410\nSo, it allows for simultaneous changes,\n\n71\n00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.100\nwhich I'm not gonna be able to say,\nto the document with other people.\n\n72\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.510\nBut the changes are only seen\n\n73\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.760\nwhen somebody presses Save\nat that particular point.\n\n74\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.050\nSo, now a new save, what that should do\n\n75\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.900\non the other end as they see it wow it\nsays hey, look, updates are now available.\n\n76\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.610\nSo, it might be where Cherokee, how she\nedited the first part of the document, and\n\n77\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.270\nI don't see any of those changes.\n\n78\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.320\nAnd then, she hit Saved and\n\n79\n00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.840\nall of a sudden I get a notification\nthat updates are available.\n\n80\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.730\nAnd from that point, I should see and\nrefresh the document and\n\n81\n00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.340\nthat should actually give me\nthe changes that Cherokee made.\n\n82\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.490\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ryan.\n\n83\n00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.160\nWhat if I was on a conference call\nwith you and a couple other people and\n\n84\n00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.220\nI wanted to edit that document\ncollaboratively in real-time?\n\n85\n00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.520\nIs there an option for that?\n\n86\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.320\n&gt;&gt; There really is.\n\n87\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.432\nAnd that is exactly what they\ncall real-time co-authoring, and\n\n88\n00:04:52.432 --> 00:04:54.219\nthat actually makes sense for us too.\n\n89\n00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:58.584\nSo, when we do real time co-authoring,\nI again just like I was describing\n\n90\n00:04:58.584 --> 00:05:01.495\na little bit earlier,\nit gets media ability to see\n\n91\n00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:07.090\nCherokee make the changes at the same time\nas I might be working on the document too.\n\n92\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.110\nSo, the great advantage of this probably\nisn't something like we're working on\n\n93\n00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.520\nlet's say a streamline process like a\nstory, but as far as just a regular story.\n\n94\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.080\nBut you can see where\nthis might be helpful for\n\n95\n00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.100\ncertain people like developers, right?\n\n96\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.170\nThat are actually taking a look at\nthe code, and seeing the code as they work\n\n97\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.820\nthrough it and being able to see\nthat single-wherever they coded that\n\n98\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.370\ninformation into to make the changes\nthat they need to at the same time.\n\n99\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.610\nIt might be a real helpful solution for\n\n100\n00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.510\nthem if they were doing\nsomething like this as well.\n\n101\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.210\nSo, those two are pretty much\nthe key when you do this.\n\n102\n00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.040\nNow, you do have decide on which\nones are actually the better fit for\n\n103\n00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.690\nyour company when you choose\nto do something like that.\n\n104\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.010\nAnd that's a little bit harder that goes\nbeyong the scope of just talking about it.\n\n105\n00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.160\nThat's when you have the plan and\nsay which one is the better fit for us?\n\n106\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.580\nReal time editing can happen, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.410\nBut it can lead to some unusual conflicts\ninstead of actually revealing changes and\n\n108\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.540\nthen, making changes, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.250\nThat's probably more of\nan editorial process,\n\n110\n00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.300\nwhereas real time live coauthoring.\n\n111\n00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.150\nIf you were in the same room,\n\n112\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.070\nit will probably lead to some\nfist fights at times, right?\n\n113\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But-\n\n114\n00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.830\n&gt;&gt; No, it has to say this, or\n\n115\n00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.430\nit has to say that, exactly.\n\n116\n00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you do, you have to kind of\nplan that out to what your organization\n\n117\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.590\nneeds best if you're doing this.\n\n118\n00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.110\nBy default, though, SharePoint,\nI want to make sure I say this right.\n\n119\n00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.990\nOne Drive and\nSharePoint have this turned on by default.\n\n120\n00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.650\nSo if you have your documents\nin one drive and now,\n\n121\n00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.500\nyou're saying I need to make sure that\nsomebody else is involved in this and\n\n122\n00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.900\nbeing with co-authoring to this,\nall you have to do is share this out and\n\n123\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.540\ngive them the privileges\nthat they need to do so, and\n\n124\n00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.950\nthat will allow for\nthe a co-authoring test to occur.\n\n125\n00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.340\nSo, let's see if we can actually\nmake an example of this.\n\n126\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.690\nIf everything is actually set\nup the way that it should be,\n\n127\n00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.700\nwe should be able to do this,\nbut let's check it out here.\n\n128\n00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.240\nSo, we'll go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine.\n\n129\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.250\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, are there any kind of system\nrequirement to prove requisites that we\n\n130\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.046\nshould be aware of?\n\n131\n00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:16.170\nI know that you said that it is enabled,\nbut\n\n132\n00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.315\nanything additional that\nI need to know about?\n\n133\n00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:22.705\n&gt;&gt; Not really, right, because most of\nthe time that we're doing this inside\n\n134\n00:07:22.705 --> 00:07:27.645\nof the portal,\nwe're just connecting to their machine and\n\n135\n00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:30.430\nwe're not downloading it\nto our machine to do this.\n\n136\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.480\nWe can, but if we're only using\neven like the Office online tools,\n\n137\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.330\nit doesn't take a lot for\nus to do anyways.\n\n138\n00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.310\nSo, let's go ahead and find,\nwe'll create a document here.\n\n139\n00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.950\nI'm going to click on the Word online\ntool for us and select this one.\n\n140\n00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.809\nThis new blank document here.\n\n141\n00:07:51.186 --> 00:07:54.887\nAnd once I get this document,\n\n142\n00:07:54.887 --> 00:08:01.114\nthis is a test of the emergency\nbroadcast system.\n\n143\n00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:07.320\nThis is only a test.\n\n144\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm glad.\n\n145\n00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.880\n&gt;&gt; All right so now, everything is there.\n\n146\n00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.580\nLet me save this.\n\n147\n00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.110\nAnd I'm gonna save a copy online for\nright now and we'll call this test.\n\n148\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.204\nOne, test one.\n\n149\n00:08:28.489 --> 00:08:33.627\nAll right now, while I have this\ndocument saved, notice in the upper\n\n150\n00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:38.870\nright hand corner there's this big\nblue button here that says Share.\n\n151\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.180\nLet me see if I can zoom in, all right.\n\n152\n00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.700\nSelect Share, and this is where we get\nthe chance to actually say what we can do.\n\n153\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.850\nThe key is also over here\non the right hand side.\n\n154\n00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.050\nWe can invite certain people if\nwe want to, but it's whether or\n\n155\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.500\nnot they can edit or\nthey can only view is the key.\n\n156\n00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.560\nIf I want co-authoring to occur,\n\n157\n00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.600\nI need to make sure that they\ncan edit the document instead.\n\n158\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.540\nSo I have that option.\n\n159\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.490\nI can also select this,\nGet a link, instead and\n\n160\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.830\nthis actually is a little bit\ndifferent when we do this.\n\n161\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.629\nNotice that if I select, Get a link,\nEdit link, no sign-in required\n\n162\n00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:23.120\nmeans as long as the person has the link,\nthey can do whatever they want to.\n\n163\n00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.310\nYou also note that you\ncan do a Restricted link.\n\n164\n00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.370\nView a link here,\nwhich says these accounts are required.\n\n165\n00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:36.170\nNotice that these are internal accounts\nhere on the View link and Edit link.\n\n166\n00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:41.160\nAnd then View link, no sign-in required\nand Edit link no sign-in required.\n\n167\n00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.570\nAnd this is the one that was just created.\n\n168\n00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.740\nSo I can limit the access in\nthis way if I choose to, but for\n\n169\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.950\nright now I'm not gonna worry about it.\n\n170\n00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:53.340\nI'm gonna actually choose\nthe Invited here, okay.\n\n171\n00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.800\nThe other thing of course is to make sure\nthat when you actually have it shared\n\n172\n00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.280\nthat you have stored this into\neither your own OneDrive, or\n\n173\n00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.500\nthe OneDrive for business, or\nyour SharePoint site, okay.\n\n174\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.368\nAnd once you have that\nthen you're ready to go.\n\n175\n00:10:07.368 --> 00:10:14.133\nSo let me share this\none with Lance here and\n\n176\n00:10:14.133 --> 00:10:20.329\ntake a look at these cool song lyrics.\n\n177\n00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:28.840\nI made them up [LAUGH] no, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.710\nBut you can see where you\ncan do some of that, right.\n\n179\n00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.620\nSo once we have that I can do the Require\nsign-on, which is perfectly fine,\n\n180\n00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.770\nif I want to.\n\n181\n00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:40.520\nI can send it as an email invitation,\nI don't have to require the sign-on but\n\n182\n00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.590\nlet me select Share.\n\n183\n00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.870\nSo once this is done,\nthat should now send, which it did.\n\n184\n00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.920\nShared with Lance Bass,\nit gives a link here.\n\n185\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.885\nNow if I switch on over\nto Lance's computer.\n\n186\n00:10:55.885 --> 00:10:59.825\nLet me get out of here,\nand now let's see if I,\n\n187\n00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:03.780\nit might take a moment,\nthere it goes, okay.\n\n188\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.450\nSo I was waiting for\nthat email to come in.\n\n189\n00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.520\nWell now we can see that Joey has\nactually just shared this outtake,\n\n190\n00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.050\nTake a look at these cool\nsong lyrics I made them up.\n\n191\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.840\nThat was so that you could see I\nactually was typing something in there.\n\n192\n00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.540\nFrom that point,\nI can open the test.docx here,\n\n193\n00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.920\nwhich is the Word document.\n\n194\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.530\n&gt;&gt; With your emergency broadcast system.\n\n195\n00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.840\n&gt;&gt; That's right, with my emergency\nbroadcast system available to us.\n\n196\n00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.898\nAnd yeah, and the message that's here.\n\n197\n00:11:32.898 --> 00:11:39.458\nSo on this one, let's see what\nhappens now if I try and do something.\n\n198\n00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:42.280\nSo let's see what can I actually do here.\n\n199\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.370\nSo, accessibility mode, let's see if that,\nit's just gonna make it bigger and\n\n200\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.640\nI didn't need that.\n\n201\n00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.750\nLet me turn that off.\n\n202\n00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.840\nI needed edit, I was looking at that.\n\n203\n00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.890\nEdit document,\nI can edit in the browser or in Word.\n\n204\n00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.241\nI'm just going to do Edit\nin Browser at this point.\n\n205\n00:12:03.441 --> 00:12:06.417\nAnd you can also see at the same time,\n\n206\n00:12:06.417 --> 00:12:10.260\nnotice it says Joey was\nediting the document and\n\n207\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:15.080\nyou can see that also appear at the top,\nJoey Editing online\n\n208\n00:12:19.736 --> 00:12:24.550\nSo now you can see where Joey did it and\nthen I can probably put a note here.\n\n209\n00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:30.703\nWe need a cool repeating chorus.\n\n210\n00:12:30.703 --> 00:12:35.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n211\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.620\nif I switch back over, look at that.\n\n212\n00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.390\nIt actually did change, and\nnow you can see where Lance was typing.\n\n213\n00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.480\nSo there is the real time editing\nactually happening right there between\n\n214\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.840\nthe both of them as they do this.\n\n215\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.500\nSo it does give you this ability to\nmake sure that everything is done.\n\n216\n00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.950\nAnd there it is, Lance Bass is editing\nonline, and I can see that he's here.\n\n217\n00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.401\nOver on the other side you can\nsee where Joey is editing, and\n\n218\n00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:04.723\nhe is also right here.\n\n219\n00:13:04.723 --> 00:13:09.562\nSo both of you, Joey and Lance,\ncan actually be working collaboratively on\n\n220\n00:13:09.562 --> 00:13:14.112\nthis new and amazing song lyric for\nboy bands, whatever that might be.\n\n221\n00:13:14.112 --> 00:13:15.961\n&gt;&gt; I know you keep talking to\nthem like we're on a first\n\n222\n00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.084\nname basis with these people.\n\n223\n00:13:17.084 --> 00:13:19.424\n&gt;&gt; Well, we are now, so there you go.\n\n224\n00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n225\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.400\n&gt;&gt; But you can see why this it can\nbe an important solution, right?\n\n226\n00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.410\nSo it might not be where you're\nworking on something, but\n\n227\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.250\nit could be, it could be where you really\nare working on song lyrics together.\n\n228\n00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.440\nAnd it may help that you're actually\nlooking at the same document\n\n229\n00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.300\nall at one time.\n\n230\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.200\nBut at the same time, inside of business,\nit might be something\n\n231\n00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.900\nwhere both of you are reviewing something\nand instead of me reviewing and\n\n232\n00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.810\nthen go, Cherokee, I'm ready to review\nthis, forwarding it on an email.\n\n233\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.960\nWe're actually looking at\nit at the same time and\n\n234\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.280\nthen offering our own edits into it,\nif we want to.\n\n235\n00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.250\nAnd this way whoever is\nalso part of that group\n\n236\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.150\ncan maybe later on after we're done\ndoing all the editing that we're doing.\n\n237\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.254\nThey may open it up and also be able\nto see the little mark here that shows\n\n238\n00:14:04.254 --> 00:14:07.817\nthat Joey edited it,\nas well as Lance Bass has edited it too.\n\n239\n00:14:07.817 --> 00:14:13.063\nSo it really does give us this ability to\ntake a look at the idea of co-authoring\n\n240\n00:14:13.063 --> 00:14:17.682\nhere, and making sure that we can see and\ndo what we need to do, okay.\n\n241\n00:14:17.682 --> 00:14:22.381\nSo that's one of the reasons\nwhy we do have these shared\n\n242\n00:14:22.381 --> 00:14:25.270\nfeatures available to us.\n\n243\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.800\nMost of the time in organizations, you're\nnot gonna turn this off, cuz that's just,\n\n244\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.320\nI hate to say it, that kind of defeats\nthe purpose of why we use Office 365.\n\n245\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.110\nBut there are, if you go in deep\nenough inside of SharePoint,\n\n246\n00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.920\nyou can find the ability to turn off this\nfeature for co-authoring if you choose to.\n\n247\n00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.810\nBut most of the time\nwe're not gonna do that.\n\n248\n00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay, an example that you showed\nus here was with Microsoft Word, but\n\n249\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.980\njust to verify, we can use this\nparticular co-authoring idea\n\n250\n00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.990\nwith other types of documents,\nright Ronnie?\n\n251\n00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.480\n&gt;&gt; You do have some other\ndocuments that you can do but\n\n252\n00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.200\nnot everything works in this way.\n\n253\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.280\nSo the general practice of this, let me\nmake sure that I have this right, Word,\n\n254\n00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.700\nExcel, PowerPoint 2010, Excel Online and\nalso the one for Android,\n\n255\n00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:15.910\nWindows Mobile Editions will also work\nwith the real time authoring as well.\n\n256\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:21.530\nBut the problem that you have there\nis that we're only limited to DOCXs,\n\n257\n00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.120\nokay, which is gonna be\nyour word document format.\n\n258\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.010\nYou're also of course the Excel documents,\n\n259\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:34.260\nthe XLSX which wow harder to say\nthan I thought it was gonna be.\n\n260\n00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.230\nAnd then the PPTX.\n\n261\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.592\nAll those files are actually ending in\nthat as long as you have the tool that is\n\n262\n00:15:40.592 --> 00:15:45.363\navailable to you, whether you're talking\nabout using Office 2016 or whether\n\n263\n00:15:45.363 --> 00:15:50.202\nyou're talking about Office Online, as\nlong as the co-authoring permissions and\n\n264\n00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:53.432\nyou have the ability to do so,\nit will allow you to do it.\n\n265\n00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:56.713\nIf you end up running on an edition of\nOffice that doesn't give you that ability,\n\n266\n00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:59.980\nyou won't be able to co-author even\nif you do have those permissions.\n\n267\n00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.870\nSo just kind of realize that that is\na part Of what has to go on if we do this.\n\n268\n00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.799\nThe only other limitation here, right,\n\n269\n00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:10.590\nis that you can't do this if\nthe document's stored on your computer.\n\n270\n00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.230\nSo if you know that it's gonna\nbe co-authored at some point,\n\n271\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.660\nyou need to store it in your OneDrive,\nor your OneDrive for\n\n272\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.497\nBusiness, or your SharePoint collection\nonline, or the actual server itself.\n\n273\n00:16:22.497 --> 00:16:27.016\nSo those are kind of what we\ntake a look at in terms of that.\n\n274\n00:16:27.016 --> 00:16:31.670\nWhich is just storing it where both sides\ncan get access to it fairly easily.\n\n275\n00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:36.147\nAnd that's what SharePoint as well\nas OneDrive, One Drive for business,\n\n276\n00:16:36.147 --> 00:16:40.672\nI know I keep repeating these, but\nthose are two different products.\n\n277\n00:16:40.672 --> 00:16:44.110\nAnd then, of course,\nSharePoint is also there too.\n\n278\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.840\nNow the weird thing is it all\ndoes tie back into SharePoint.\n\n279\n00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.490\nBut at the same time they\ndo keep them separated out.\n\n280\n00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.440\nSo just realize you have\nthe ability to do that,\n\n281\n00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.680\nsharing the way that we\nwant to right there.\n\n282\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.230\n&gt;&gt; Now if I were trying to share in\na Windows domain environment and\n\n283\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.690\nI wasn't using Office 365,\nI could go ahead and set group policy and\n\n284\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.460\npermissions to reflect that access.\n\n285\n00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.490\nWhen we look at a solution\nlike Office 365,\n\n286\n00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.260\nwhat do I have in terms\nof creating groups?\n\n287\n00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.430\nIs that gonna be something similar?\n\n288\n00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:20.820\n&gt;&gt; Well, groups, once again,\nthe buy-in is kinda the key here.\n\n289\n00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.860\nGroups are a little bit different than\nwhat we're talking about right now.\n\n290\n00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.810\nWhere we can do it in\na couple of different ways.\n\n291\n00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:33.780\nSo if you're not familiar with that term,\nOffice 365 Groups, you might be familiar\n\n292\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.340\nwith the term distribution list,\nis what you're generally familiar with.\n\n293\n00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.453\nAnd so when you start to take a look\nat that, a distribution list and\n\n294\n00:17:41.453 --> 00:17:46.447\na group are almost equatable in that sense\nwhere if you like that traditional idea\n\n295\n00:17:46.447 --> 00:17:48.063\nof a distribution group,\n\n296\n00:17:48.063 --> 00:17:52.929\nwhere you essentially have a common inbox\nthat you can send information into.\n\n297\n00:17:52.929 --> 00:17:57.260\nWell, that's what an Office 365\nGroup allows you to be able to do.\n\n298\n00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.996\nBut you can also create what we call\nan Office 365 Group inside of Yammer that\n\n299\n00:18:01.996 --> 00:18:03.726\nalmost does the same thing.\n\n300\n00:18:03.726 --> 00:18:08.087\nBut instead of having a shared inbox,\nyou're actually sharing that social media\n\n301\n00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:11.564\nexperience together,\nwhere you're saying, I don't need just\n\n302\n00:18:11.564 --> 00:18:15.122\ndocuments that are coming in and\nemails that are being exchanged.\n\n303\n00:18:15.122 --> 00:18:17.000\nBut I really need\na complete solution here.\n\n304\n00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.420\nSo that's what can end up happening.\n\n305\n00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:25.008\nWhen you start to do this, what you\nactually end up doing is when you create\n\n306\n00:18:25.008 --> 00:18:27.493\ngroups, you end up going into Outlook.\n\n307\n00:18:27.493 --> 00:18:31.738\nAnd once you actually create that group,\nit creates the entire infrastructure for\n\n308\n00:18:31.738 --> 00:18:34.460\nyou that you need to be\nable to set things up.\n\n309\n00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.670\nSo let's show you what we're\ntalking about to do this.\n\n310\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.646\nLet me get back out of that here and\n\n311\n00:18:40.646 --> 00:18:44.632\nwe'll go to his Outlook Online.\n\n312\n00:18:44.632 --> 00:18:47.163\nActually, I think I can\ndo it in the client here.\n\n313\n00:18:47.163 --> 00:18:49.430\nLet me see if I got,\nlet me go back to Joey.\n\n314\n00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.160\nI'm more familiar with\nJoey's account right now.\n\n315\n00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.840\nSo, let me see if I bring up\nOutlook on this computer and\n\n316\n00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.360\nshow you how to create\nsomething like this.\n\n317\n00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.766\nIf I can actually spell Outlook,\nit would help.\n\n318\n00:19:03.766 --> 00:19:08.600\nLooking for above OneNote, which is silly\nsince O-U is actually after O-N here.\n\n319\n00:19:11.104 --> 00:19:12.580\nAll right, so here it is.\n\n320\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:19.400\nI have now opened up the client itself\non Microsoft Outlook on Joey's computer.\n\n321\n00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.490\nNow we're gonna create this idea\nof a group inside of Outlook,\n\n322\n00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.760\nwhich really is that\ndistribution list idea.\n\n323\n00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.280\nWhat we're looking for is gonna be\nright up here on the actual bar.\n\n324\n00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.023\nSo instead of you take a look at the Home\ntab and you scroll over to right,\n\n325\n00:19:37.023 --> 00:19:40.284\nyou'll see a grouping called,\nwell, Groups.\n\n326\n00:19:40.284 --> 00:19:44.267\nAnd then I can select New Group.\n\n327\n00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:48.200\nWhen I do this,\nit will help me to create this group.\n\n328\n00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:53.430\nA group provides a place for\nshared conversations such as an email\n\n329\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:20:01.230\nthread if you want to, files to go into\nand here is a key, a group calendar, okay?\n\n330\n00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.530\nSo that we can set this up and\n\n331\n00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.410\nnow everybody has access to\nthis calendar if they do this.\n\n332\n00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.430\nAnd then you choose your name.\n\n333\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.270\nJust like what we talked about in Yammer,\nthis should be planned out.\n\n334\n00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.710\nWe shouldn't need a ton of\ngroups in our organization\n\n335\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.610\nunless we really need a ton of groups.\n\n336\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.700\nSo we don't just tend to create them just\nbecause we want to create them, okay?\n\n337\n00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.000\nBut you can if you choose to.\n\n338\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.657\nSo let's say for this one,\nlet's do this as IT for\n\n339\n00:20:27.657 --> 00:20:31.306\nsupport or let's say TierOne.\n\n340\n00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.060\nNow we'll take a look if\nthat's actually available.\n\n341\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.710\nIf my mouse doesn't lock up, there we go.\n\n342\n00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:46.510\nOkay, so here's a group name that\nI've created and here's a Group ID.\n\n343\n00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:52.220\nAlso, on the Privacy here, notice\nthe difference between Public and Private.\n\n344\n00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:57.010\nThe majority of times, as far as I know,\nI don't know of any reason for\n\n345\n00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.900\nus not to do this, is that we're probably\ngonna create these private groups.\n\n346\n00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.689\nOkay, so that only approved\nmembers can see what is inside.\n\n347\n00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.530\nThe reason why is if you don't\nthat essentially invites\n\n348\n00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.030\neverybody in your organization to look\nat whatever's actually in that inbox,\n\n349\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.910\nand that's probably not\nsomething you really want to do.\n\n350\n00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.665\nSubscribe new members, so that when they\nreceive conversations in their inbox.\n\n351\n00:21:19.665 --> 00:21:22.830\nOtherwise they'll only see\nthem in the group inbox.\n\n352\n00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:27.220\nSo you can have it where that might be\nthe easier one to be able to do that.\n\n353\n00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.760\nSo they actually end up\nreceiving the entire group\n\n354\n00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.900\nconversation in their inbox, as well.\n\n355\n00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.930\nAfter the group is created,\nyou can add members to it.\n\n356\n00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.840\nAnd once this is created,\n\n357\n00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.230\nthere are a couple of things that\nend up working out on Exchange.\n\n358\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.750\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, what do we need to have ready\nin order to start using the groups\n\n359\n00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:46.730\nwith Office 365?\n\n360\n00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:51.092\n&gt;&gt; Well, you have to have an account\nthat gives you that ability, right?\n\n361\n00:21:51.092 --> 00:21:56.110\nSo one of those Business Premium accounts\nis what you have to be able to have there.\n\n362\n00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.230\nIt's the Business Essentials or\nBusiness Premium Plan.\n\n363\n00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:05.612\nYou can also, of course,\nhave to have an e-based plan, right?\n\n364\n00:22:05.612 --> 00:22:07.971\nLike e-1, e-2, e-4, e-5,\n\n365\n00:22:07.971 --> 00:22:13.060\nall those are also possible when you\nhave something like this too, okay?\n\n366\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.100\nSo these groups, if you're gonna do that,\n\n367\n00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.980\nthey have to have users that\nhave those accounts in them.\n\n368\n00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.650\nSo this is a little bit more\nof an expensive venture but\n\n369\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.860\nit does give you that ability to do so.\n\n370\n00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n371\n00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.470\nwhen we create this account, if I go ahead\nand click OK when it's setting up here.\n\n372\n00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:32.530\nIt's setting up that common inbox,\nit's setting up that common calendar.\n\n373\n00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:39.360\nIt's creating for\nus a document library, a notebook.\n\n374\n00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.600\nA SharePoint team site and\na planner for that group.\n\n375\n00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.860\nSo, it's really essentially creating,\nI hate to say this, but another actual\n\n376\n00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:56.900\nfree subscription of Office 365 for\nyour group.\n\n377\n00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.630\nBut that's the easiest way to describe it.\n\n378\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.600\nCuz if you take a look at all the stuff\nthat I just talked about here, the inbox,\n\n379\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.020\nthe calendar, the document library,\nOneNote, Notebook,\n\n380\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.020\nSharePoint teams site, planner, we can do\nall that in my Office 365 subscription.\n\n381\n00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.440\n&gt;&gt; But we're really talking about\nselectively isolating individuals to\n\n382\n00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.090\nthose specific groups?\n\n383\n00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.250\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n384\n00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.720\nSo this is how we do it right here.\n\n385\n00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.967\nSo once I've created the group,\nlet's take a look here on the screen.\n\n386\n00:23:23.967 --> 00:23:27.821\nThis will help us out.\n\n387\n00:23:27.821 --> 00:23:31.362\nI don't really have a lot of people\nin here, so let's see, Lance.\n\n388\n00:23:39.055 --> 00:23:40.480\nMake sure I add him in there.\n\n389\n00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.871\nWe'll also add in JT, let's see if\nit actually, he doesn't have that.\n\n390\n00:23:45.871 --> 00:23:48.311\nThere's a reason why he doesn't have one.\n\n391\n00:23:48.311 --> 00:23:51.845\nAnd that is because his\nparticular account, yeah,\n\n392\n00:23:51.845 --> 00:23:54.334\nhis account is that Office Pro Plus,\n\n393\n00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:59.090\nwhich doesn't include that E1\nsubscription or anything like that.\n\n394\n00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:03.140\nOr that Business Premium or\nBusiness Basic type of account here.\n\n395\n00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.482\nSo if they don't have that access\nthey won't be able to join this,\n\n396\n00:24:06.482 --> 00:24:08.820\nthese are the only two\nthat I really have then.\n\n397\n00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:16.140\nAnd of course you can describe what this\ngroup is for to help them with the buy-in,\n\n398\n00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.220\nI'm gonna click OK.\n\n399\n00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.670\nOr at least I think I'm clicking OK.\n\n400\n00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.170\nAnd now there it is, the group is\ngonna now be updated and created.\n\n401\n00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:31.680\nAnd you can see here in Joey's account,\nwhere he's now received, and, Welcome to.\n\n402\n00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:37.190\nThe very fact that the new\nTierOne group is ready.\n\n403\n00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:41.770\nWe now have access to the conversation,\nadd to the teams site that I\n\n404\n00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.860\nhad just created, share files,\nconnect to different apps.\n\n405\n00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.820\nAnd it even gives you the ability to\ndo these mobile apps if you choose\n\n406\n00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.140\nto right away.\n\n407\n00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.850\nIt allows you to add in messages,\nyou name it.\n\n408\n00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:56.180\nEverything is now ready to go for\nsomething like this,\n\n409\n00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.690\nif we choose this type of group\naccess to be able to do this.\n\n410\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.970\nLet's check over on Joey's here,\nand let's see what's going on.\n\n411\n00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:05.730\nThere it is.\n\n412\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.320\nNotice it also showed up\nin this time on his online.\n\n413\n00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.280\nShowed up over here on the left hand side,\nunder groups.\n\n414\n00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.873\nAnd I get this little, neat green\nsnowflake, I guess is what that is.\n\n415\n00:25:17.873 --> 00:25:20.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's just say an asterisk.\n\n416\n00:25:20.791 --> 00:25:22.610\n&gt;&gt; That's not an asterisk.\n\n417\n00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.730\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like a special one.\n\n418\n00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.450\n&gt;&gt; That's a snowflake.\n\n419\n00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.140\nI'm joking, I don't care.\n\n420\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.390\nAll right.\n\n421\n00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:35.100\nSo now you can see that for Joey, it\nreally does look like that webpage, right?\n\n422\n00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.110\nHere's the shared,\nlet me see if I can click on it.\n\n423\n00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.860\nShared calendar.\n\n424\n00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.370\nLook at that!\n&gt;&gt; Nice, yeah.\n\n425\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.050\n&gt;&gt; Access files if we had any files.\n\n426\n00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.859\nThere's that shared OneNote\nnotebook that Cherokee loves.\n\n427\n00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.010\nI'm not so enamored by OneNote.\n\n428\n00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:57.380\nConnectors, you name it, it all fits in\nif you do need to create these groups.\n\n429\n00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.380\nYou can do this as well inside of Yammer.\n\n430\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.120\nNow remember, that if you do this inside\nof Yammer, you'll still get pretty much\n\n431\n00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.810\nthe same things, but\nyou won't get the Shared one inbox.\n\n432\n00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.720\nI was trying to remember\nwhat that term was.\n\n433\n00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.590\nYou don't get to share the inbox nor\n\n434\n00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:17.470\nthe calendar,\nis pretty much the one that you don't get.\n\n435\n00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.300\nSo let's just take a look at where\nwe go and do that just briefly here.\n\n436\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.870\nLet me launch Yammer up.\n\n437\n00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:35.560\nAnd hopefully in just a moment,\nand it is inside of Yammer.\n\n438\n00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.980\nI should be able to create a group here.\n\n439\n00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:38.730\nThere it is.\n\n440\n00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.190\nSuggested groups.\n\n441\n00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.860\nLet me see if I can select that.\n\n442\n00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.680\nThere we go.\nOnce I've selected that,\n\n443\n00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.240\nnotice I can create another\nYammer group right here.\n\n444\n00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.610\nAnd we are off and ready to go.\n\n445\n00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:56.060\nSo it brings us back to that same ability\nto do the same things at this point for\n\n446\n00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.330\nwhat we were just talking\nabout in terms of groups.\n\n447\n00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.090\nThis one gives you that same thing,\nability to create internal or\n\n448\n00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.640\nexternal groups as well, and\n\n449\n00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.630\nwe've already seen this earlier inside\nof just creating groups for Yammer.\n\n450\n00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.649\nBut all that is, it just shows\nyou a different focus, right?\n\n451\n00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.200\nDepends on your team and\nwhat they really need and\n\n452\n00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.990\nthat's why you have to plan this out.\n\n453\n00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.840\nIf they really like that\nconcept of the shared inbox and\n\n454\n00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.990\nthey don't like the social media thing you\nmight choose to go with creating in out.\n\n455\n00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:27.080\nIf they go no social media is perfectly\nfine it gives us everything that we need\n\n456\n00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.460\nto well then, we would go with the Yammer\nonce you have it turned on, of course,\n\n457\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.700\ninside of your group.\n\n458\n00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.630\nAnd that's kind of the key as we do this.\n\n459\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:40.920\nBut do especially be careful with\nthe public regardless of which one you do.\n\n460\n00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.480\nBecause that can expose more\ninformation than your realize.\n\n461\n00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.060\nSo usually the best practice is\ndon't create those unless you\n\n462\n00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.560\nabsolutely have to.\n\n463\n00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.890\nIn other words if there's another\nways that you can share stuff\n\n464\n00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.860\nwith people outside of your organization.\n\n465\n00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.460\n&gt;&gt; Like sending individual\nlinks to a particular file.\n\n466\n00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they recommend to do that right.\n\n467\n00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.250\nBut you can.\n\n468\n00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.830\nIt gives you the ability to do so.\n\n469\n00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.880\nBut you do have to be\nwary of the sensitivity\n\n470\n00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.590\nof those files that are shared.\n\n471\n00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.070\nSo do make sure that you\npay attention there.\n\n472\n00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ryan,\ndo you see that we need to look at\n\n473\n00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.770\nmigrating files to Office 365 for\nBusiness.\n\n474\n00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:18.610\nBut do we have time for that, or do you\nwant to go ahead and create a part two?\n\n475\n00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Actually it will be a part three.\n\n476\n00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:22.410\nYeah.\n\n477\n00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.290\nSo let's go ahead and wave on that-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n478\n00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:28.750\n&gt;&gt; Just a little bit and\nthen we'll do that as well as talk about\n\n479\n00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.830\nsome other things that we have\nto make sure that we understand.\n\n480\n00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.410\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for your time today and\nthank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n481\n00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:35.140\njoining us.\n\n482\n00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.980\nBut, for this show we are out of time.\n\n483\n00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.510\nSo we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n484\n00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.203\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n485\n00:28:40.203 --> 00:28:41.071\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n486\n00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:42.796\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

00:00:12.145\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.940\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Enabling Office\n365 services series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.130\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.480\nIn this episode, we will continue to\nlook at ways that we can plan for\n\n7\n00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.000\ncollaboration within our\nOffice 365 environment.\n\n8\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.470\nBack in studios with us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.030\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me\nback as we continue to take a look\n\n11\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.550\nat Office 365 Collaboration Solutions.\n\n12\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.780\nAnd this time we're actually gonna jump\ninto some of the other things that we\n\n13\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.210\nhave to kinda mention.\n\n14\n00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.510\nAnd maybe even some of the tools that you\nmay not have actually seen before as well.\n\n15\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.450\nSo let's go ahead and dive in as we\nstart to think about collaboration.\n\n16\n00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.190\nRemember that in today's society\nespecially on the computing side, right?\n\n17\n00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910\nThat desktop computers\nare no longer just the norm\n\n18\n00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.050\nin terms of where people work anymore.\n\n19\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.620\nWe've turned into almost\na 24 hours a day work cycle.\n\n20\n00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.570\nEven if you don't think that you have,\nyou might have actually done it,\n\n21\n00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.490\nand didn't realize it.\n\n22\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, sure.\nIf we think about our concept of BYOD,\n\n23\n00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.460\nbring your own device,\nwe can take that 40-hour-a-week employee.\n\n24\n00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.835\nAnd if we allow them access to their\nwork files, I'm assuming files,\n\n25\n00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:29.029\nthen we're turning essential that\n40-hour a week employee into\n\n26\n00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:34.950\nkind of like an almost on call or always\non type employee which sounds great for\n\n27\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.259\nthose employers but is there really a way.\n\n28\n00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.030\nI know we can install our work\nemail on these mobile devices.\n\n29\n00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.970\nWhat about these files?\n\n30\n00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.580\nCan we access them on\nthe mobile devices as well?\n\n31\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.470\n&gt;&gt; You definitely can, and that is because\nOffice 365 has become that solution\n\n32\n00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.340\nto essentially allow\nyou to stay connected.\n\n33\n00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.870\nAnd to get connected to your\noffice environment, right,\n\n34\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.810\nyour actual production network.\n\n35\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.570\nAs long as you're using\nthe shared folders and\n\n36\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.990\nthe shared collaboration solutions\nthat are up there in the cloud.\n\n37\n00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.100\nBut if you start storing stuff\nindividually on your own\n\n38\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.540\nwork computers than no.\n\n39\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.120\nBut that's really the key right?\n\n40\n00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.010\nIf you can gain access to any of those\ndevices that allow you to download and\n\n41\n00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.370\nwork with, of course the Office products\non your Android phone or your iPad or\n\n42\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.020\nyour iPod or\nwhatever other phone you want to,\n\n43\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.520\nWindows Mobile if you happen\nto choose to do that.\n\n44\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.190\nIt gives you the ability to have\nthe same types of connection\n\n45\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.390\nthat you would even though I'm on a laptop\nor I'm on the actual desktop computer.\n\n46\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.894\nNow for those you that live on\nthose devices like tablets and\n\n47\n00:02:37.894 --> 00:02:41.961\nsmart phones God bless you because I\nreally can hardly see my phone and\n\n48\n00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:45.278\nit's a bigger phone, but\nI really can hardly see them.\n\n49\n00:02:45.278 --> 00:02:48.635\nAnd me trying to type with my thumb of\nsome of the stuff that I normally end up\n\n50\n00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:49.370\ntyping out.\n\n51\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.930\nI don't know if I could do it but\n\n52\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.350\nit does give us that solution to\nbe able to do so we choose to.\n\n53\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.040\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie are you familiar with a\nsolution a different solution at Microsoft\n\n54\n00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.890\noffers called work folders and\nwe're really not tying or\n\n55\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.570\nmarrying that with a particular\nOffice 365 account.\n\n56\n00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.335\nSo I'm really excited to see how we're\ngonna go about this by using Office 365.\n\n57\n00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:13.195\n&gt;&gt; This is where we have to at least\nknow some of the terminology or\n\n58\n00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:16.100\nsome of the products that\nare gonna be offered here.\n\n59\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.523\nAnything that we can share from is pretty\nmuch the key inside of Office 365.\n\n60\n00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:25.074\nSo when it comes down to the idea of\nworking with files across multiple\n\n61\n00:03:25.074 --> 00:03:29.390\ndevices, mobile devices\nregardless of what they are.\n\n62\n00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.480\nYou then of course would need\nan application on the individual phones\n\n63\n00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.810\nthat will allow you to\naccess those files and\n\n64\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.880\nthen you would need that connection\ninto your Office 365 account.\n\n65\n00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.180\nSo you at least need those two things\nto make it happen on the mobile end or\n\n66\n00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.500\non the device end.\n\n67\n00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.250\nBut once you have that,\nyou also then need for all of your\n\n68\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.530\nfiles that you're going to be working with\nto be stored up in that cloud structure.\n\n69\n00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.902\nAnd this is where we have to be able\nto distinguish between something like\n\n70\n00:03:59.902 --> 00:04:05.420\nOneDrive itself as well as OneDrive for\nBusiness and even the idea of\n\n71\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.880\nusing a site collection such as the\nSharePoint Online site collection as well.\n\n72\n00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.110\nAnd this is kind of the different things\nthat we have to at least understand and\n\n73\n00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.220\nsee what ends up happening.\n\n74\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.930\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, I see in the chat here,\n\n75\n00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.360\nsomeone in our chat feels the same way you\ndo about having those smaller devices.\n\n76\n00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.890\nAnd they're saying, even a regular\nlike a smaller device like a laptop\n\n77\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.940\nscreen can be difficult\nto look at sometimes.\n\n78\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.870\nAnd just don't forget that you do\nhave other solutions out there.\n\n79\n00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.680\nI can think of one particular app\ncalled Duet that can allow you\n\n80\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.555\nif you already have a tablet for\nMac and Windows environments.\n\n81\n00:04:42.555 --> 00:04:45.285\nYou can download this application,\nit's ten bucks.\n\n82\n00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.065\nAnd then you could essentially use that\ntablet device as an extra monitor.\n\n83\n00:04:48.065 --> 00:04:51.995\nIt might not be a perfect solution, but\nat least it's kind of a workaround for\n\n84\n00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:54.535\npeople who are traveling, and\ndon't wanna carry a ton of equipment.\n\n85\n00:04:54.535 --> 00:04:57.825\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that today\nthere's more solutions than ever, and\n\n86\n00:04:57.825 --> 00:04:58.516\nyou hate to say this.\n\n87\n00:04:58.516 --> 00:05:03.380\nIn two months' time from now, there\nwill probably be even better solutions\n\n88\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.920\nthan what we have right now as well.\n\n89\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.730\nIt's kind of funny, I don't know,\nI'm going off on a tangent here.\n\n90\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.970\nBut it's just happening,\nand that's the way it goes.\n\n91\n00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.410\nWe went from the idea of super small\nphones now to super gigantic phones and\n\n92\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.610\nthen, along with the Apple Watch,\nwe got really tiny and small again.\n\n93\n00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.310\nAnd it's getting to that point where\nit's almost impossible to keep up with\n\n94\n00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.440\nwhether we're gonna go big, or\ngo large, or go small again.\n\n95\n00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.804\n&gt;&gt; Hashtag what's trending.\n\n96\n00:05:28.804 --> 00:05:31.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whatever's trending.\n\n97\n00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.850\nAnd the very fact is, they are.\n\n98\n00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.240\nThey're just changing\non such a daily basis.\n\n99\n00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.050\nIt's hard to know what's gonna be optimal\nand available six months from now,\n\n100\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.850\nbetter yet, a year from now\nwhat's gonna end up happening.\n\n101\n00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.310\nBut Office 365 says look,\n\n102\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.740\nas long as we can get the apps on there,\nthat's what we want.\n\n103\n00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.020\nBut kinda remember both ends of it, right?\n\n104\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.700\nThe user at one end,\n\n105\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.070\nhe has to have the application,\nhas to be able to connect in Office 365.\n\n106\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.600\nWhoever is sharing the document or\n\n107\n00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.470\nif you are from work,\nyou have to store it up there.\n\n108\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.530\nSo let's make sure we\nunderstand that side of it too.\n\n109\n00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.300\nSo let's go ahead and dive in,\nwe'll start talking about sharing.\n\n110\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.800\nAnd then we'll talk about\na couple solutions here\n\n111\n00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.810\nto help the collaboration effort go on.\n\n112\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.630\nLet's take a look here on my machine,\nI'm going to open up just.\n\n113\n00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.270\nLet's just use Excel as an example.\n\n114\n00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.900\nRemember that if you're users\nare unfamiliar, okay, with working with\n\n115\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.870\nthe idea of storing things online,\nOffice itself makes it relatively easy.\n\n116\n00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.050\nAnd this might be something you have to\ncommunicate to the end user to understand.\n\n117\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.780\nWhen they go to save,\nall they have to do is hit File And\n\n118\n00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.230\nnotice that it is here that\nyou have different options.\n\n119\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.120\nSo even though this says Open,\n\n120\n00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.200\nif I now choose Save, notice that I have\nthese different options under Save As.\n\n121\n00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.680\nAnd that's what we want to take a look at.\n\n122\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.970\nSo at this point, it's saying, hey,\nwhere are we actually going to save it?\n\n123\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.260\nThe default that I have right now, if you\ntake a look at this link here at the top\n\n124\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:12.890\nof my screen, notice it says\nofficeprodemoco-my.sharepoint.com,\n\n125\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.490\npersonal, and it actually gives me,\nof course, the account name that we have.\n\n126\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.070\nAnd you can see that list to there, so\n\n127\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.710\nthat's where is actually\ngoing to save it by default.\n\n128\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.070\nYou can set this up\ninside of group policy,\n\n129\n00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.910\nyou can do all that if you choose to but\nas an individual user though.\n\n130\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.760\nThey can actually choose\neither one of these.\n\n131\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.150\nNotice that this one says OneDrive and\n\n132\n00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.800\nthere's two options here for\nOneDrive if you choose this.\n\n133\n00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.460\nThis one says OfficeProDemoCo.\n\n134\n00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.750\nYours might actually have your name or\nyour own email address attached to it.\n\n135\n00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.500\nWell that's the difference between\nOneDrive and OneDrive for Business.\n\n136\n00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.326\nSo if I wanted to I could share\nthis underneath the OneDrive for\n\n137\n00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:53.585\nBusiness account.\n\n138\n00:07:53.585 --> 00:07:57.336\nOr if I'm connected\ninto Office 365 itself,\n\n139\n00:07:57.336 --> 00:08:01.273\nnotice the site here and\nthis is a SharePoint site.\n\n140\n00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:06.025\nSo, I have different options, and each one\nof them, even though they look similar,\n\n141\n00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:10.290\nthey are going to store them in\na little bit different of a location.\n\n142\n00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.510\nBecause they are representing\ndifferent areas that we can do this.\n\n143\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.783\nAs long as we are stored between OneDrive\nitself, which is your personal OneDrive.\n\n144\n00:08:19.783 --> 00:08:24.380\nOneDrive for Business, and\nthen your SharePoint site.\n\n145\n00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.080\nThe idea and\n\n146\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.770\nkey between your organization though is\nactually gonna be these two right here.\n\n147\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:39.610\nIf you yourself, are only needing to share\nfiles occasionally, with somebody else,\n\n148\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.680\nuse your OneDrive and then go in there and\nallow for the sharing to happen.\n\n149\n00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.240\nSo this is actually designed for you\nstoring everything up onto the cloud, but\n\n150\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.750\nsharing them every once in\na while if you need to.\n\n151\n00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.370\nIf you really want to share\nthem within your own business,\n\n152\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:02.760\nOneDrive for Business is kinda\nthe key to you, doing this, as well.\n\n153\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:10.310\nSo this is actually designed for you,\njust sharing this out, and having access.\n\n154\n00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:16.230\nAnd your entire company, essentially, also\nbeing able to have access to it, as well.\n\n155\n00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.610\nBut if you want to limit that a little\nbit more and have more control,\n\n156\n00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.430\nmore permissions that are set up, you can\nactually do these sites or team sites that\n\n157\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:30.460\nwill essentially allow you to limit to who\never you want to actually have limited to.\n\n158\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.200\nSo in those aspects,\nthat's what you need to decide.\n\n159\n00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.330\nIf you're doing the collaboration,\nit's probably gonna be one of these two.\n\n160\n00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.470\nThis one is probably gonna give you\nthe best in terms of collaboration and\n\n161\n00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.100\nlimiting the sharing here.\n\n162\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.350\nThis one will give you\nkind of the moderate.\n\n163\n00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.430\nAnd this one will be relatively\nrestricted to only your files.\n\n164\n00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.460\nAnd nobody else gets to get in that\nOneDrive on your own if you don't\n\n165\n00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.840\nlet them have access to it.\n\n166\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.350\nSo that's kinda the key when you do this.\n\n167\n00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.940\nSo I'm gonna select the OneDrive here.\n\n168\n00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.372\nAnd then, notice that theres actually\na folder in here called test share.\n\n169\n00:10:04.372 --> 00:10:07.788\nIm gonna select that one and\nheres my third test, so\n\n170\n00:10:07.788 --> 00:10:12.150\nI'm now gonna name this one test three and\nsave it in there.\n\n171\n00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.320\nOnce I have that saved, now I can\nshare it out to whoever I want to, and\n\n172\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.090\nif I wanted to I could\nshare it out to Cherokee.\n\n173\n00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.020\nIf Cherokee has on her iPhone,\nI think that's what she has.\n\n174\n00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.320\nShe has the Excel app if she wants to.\n\n175\n00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.840\nShe logs in with her Office 365 account.\n\n176\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.360\nShe'll be able to if she's part of\nmy same office infrastructure, and\n\n177\n00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.230\nI've actually got that shared out to her.\n\n178\n00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.487\nShe's gonna be able to access it,\nwhich makes it a lot easier,\n\n179\n00:10:40.487 --> 00:10:43.621\nwhether she's on her phone,\non her iPhone, iPad, Watch,\n\n180\n00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:46.217\nI don't think the watch\ncomes with the Excel app.\n\n181\n00:10:46.217 --> 00:10:47.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could be wrong.\n\n182\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.680\nBut you might have that\nability to do all that.\n\n183\n00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.000\nSo that is kinda the key\ndistinguishing feature here\n\n184\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.500\nin terms of getting access to it.\n\n185\n00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.420\nThe key then is the source,\n\n186\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.250\nit just has to be online somewhere,\nthe end user has to have the application.\n\n187\n00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.810\nAnd of course access to a 365 account\n\n188\n00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.760\nthat gives them the ability to\ndo what they want to share.\n\n189\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.890\nAnd that's kind of at\nleast the beginning part\n\n190\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:18.358\nof what we needed to know right\nhere when the sharing begins, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:18.358 --> 00:11:19.524\nAll right,\n\n192\n00:11:19.524 --> 00:11:23.760\nso once we have that established that\nwe now can get all of the files.\n\n193\n00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.660\nPretty much on any device that we want.\n\n194\n00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.540\nWe need to take a look\nat another topic here.\n\n195\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nis there a way we can take those\n\n196\n00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:36.310\npreexisting files from my organization,\nand move them into OneDrive for Business?\n\n197\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.830\n&gt;&gt; You do have that ability, right?\n\n198\n00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.880\nSo a lot of times what we have,\n\n199\n00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.680\nof course, is a couple of\nthings that end up going on.\n\n200\n00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.943\nWe may not have started off with anything\nin terms of sharing in one, in Office 365.\n\n201\n00:11:48.943 --> 00:11:52.458\nSo we may not have anything up on our\nSharePoint design yet or OneDrive for\n\n202\n00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:56.220\nbusiness or even our own OneDrive\npersonal account for that matter.\n\n203\n00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.160\nAnd we are now trying to\nmove everything in there.\n\n204\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.360\nWell, the great thing is that, is a\nrelatively simple aspect to be able to do\n\n205\n00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.578\nthis, it just really depends on\nhow you choose to do this as well.\n\n206\n00:12:07.578 --> 00:12:13.790\nNow, there are PowerShell\nscripts that allow you to\n\n207\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.970\ndo these types of copies if you want to,\nto move them to the right location.\n\n208\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.240\nBut there's also other ways\nthat we can do it, and\n\n209\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.540\nwe're just gonna show you a simple way for\nright now.\n\n210\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.568\nSo let's say, for example,\nthat on your own computer's desktop,\n\n211\n00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:33.152\nthat you do have files that are adjusting\nso let's take a look at my computer and\n\n212\n00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:37.262\nI already do have some files that I\ncreated a bit earlier for this demo.\n\n213\n00:12:37.262 --> 00:12:40.159\nAnd let me go to documents here and\n\n214\n00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:44.507\nyou'll see that right there\nthere is a FanClub but\n\n215\n00:12:44.507 --> 00:12:49.992\ndatabase that you can see that\nare Presentation-2017 and\n\n216\n00:12:49.992 --> 00:12:53.220\nExcel test file and Words2Liveby.\n\n217\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's fancy because-\n\n218\n00:12:55.197 --> 00:12:56.216\n&gt;&gt; When you type the number 2\n\n219\n00:12:56.216 --> 00:12:58.043\n&gt;&gt; When you actually take the number 2, so\n\n220\n00:12:58.043 --> 00:13:01.690\nthat's probably some artist that\ncreated that's what we have here.\n\n221\n00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.470\nBut if I already have existing files and\nI want to get them up into the cloud for\n\n222\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:12.990\nsharing, well the great thing is from\nthe Office itself let me zoom out so\n\n223\n00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.050\nI can restore this down just\na little bit so that we can see it.\n\n224\n00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.090\nWe've got a couple of options here.\n\n225\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.970\nLet me select the OneDrive cloud and\nthis is the one that is connected to of\n\n226\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.250\ncourse my OneDrive Business\nif I want to share them.\n\n227\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.210\nAnd it gives me a nice little\nlink right here that says,\n\n228\n00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.340\nhey drag files up here to upload.\n\n229\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.430\nSo fairly easily and quickly,\nI can simply say all right,\n\n230\n00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.570\nI want this one to go up here.\n\n231\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:46.500\nAnd in a moment, notice it tells me that\none of these files has been uploaded\n\n232\n00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.640\nis what we have available for us to do.\n\n233\n00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.980\nAnd once I select that, now I can change\nthe sharing where it says only you and\n\n234\n00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.030\nnow, I can share that out\nto whoever I want to.\n\n235\n00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.636\nOr I can select this link up here.\n\n236\n00:13:58.636 --> 00:14:02.330\nAnd that will lead me to the same one,\nif I choose to do that.\n\n237\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.550\nSo either way, we can do that.\n\n238\n00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:09.096\nLet me select another one, too.\n\n239\n00:14:09.096 --> 00:14:10.950\nLet's say that we have a SharePoint site.\n\n240\n00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.591\nWell, instead of going in one drive, then,\n\n241\n00:14:15.591 --> 00:14:19.430\nI would now select\nthe SharePoint icon should be,\n\n242\n00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.783\nof course it's not in alphabetical order\nlike my brain thinks it should be.\n\n243\n00:14:27.412 --> 00:14:31.454\nSo now that I have the SharePoint site for\nJoey,\n\n244\n00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:36.925\nwe can do the same thing if I wanna\nto do it for the OfficePro team.\n\n245\n00:14:38.973 --> 00:14:41.850\nI can select Documents over\non the left hand side.\n\n246\n00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:47.120\nAnd now inside of Documents,\nI can go into Band.\n\n247\n00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.340\nThen select Upload.\n\n248\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.820\nWe can choose Files.\n\n249\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.460\nAnd let's see which one,\nlet's do the fan club here.\n\n250\n00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.240\nAnd in a moment you end up seeing,\n\n251\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.910\nthere it is,\nsand clubs is already listed up there.\n\n252\n00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:09.040\nSo, it's not difficult, you can actually\nend up dragging, or creating a group and\n\n253\n00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:09.910\ndrag them all up there.\n\n254\n00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.260\nAnd it will take time just to get up\nthere, and you'll be able to do that.\n\n255\n00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:18.130\nThe other way of course, that you can do\nthis is by using a synchronization tool\n\n256\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.140\nthat is installed with OneDrive for\nBusiness too.\n\n257\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.880\nSo let's a look at my screen\njust one more time, and\n\n258\n00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.920\nthis time we'll have to go behind my\nhead just a little bit to help us out.\n\n259\n00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:36.560\nBy default, when you install OneDrive\nitself with the Office ProPlus.\n\n260\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:42.340\nYou'll get this icon over here, which\nwill say OneDrive for Business, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.530\nOnce you click on that, it may tell you\nthat you have to update the computer.\n\n262\n00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:51.698\nAnd if you do, it will be right here\nwhere you'll see here's a gray cloud\n\n263\n00:15:51.698 --> 00:15:57.819\nthat says OneDrive not signed in, and then\nhere's this kind of bluish cloud as well.\n\n264\n00:15:57.819 --> 00:15:59.227\nAnd if your link for\n\n265\n00:15:59.227 --> 00:16:04.240\nwhat came in on the one that you\nhad is out of date, it'll tell you.\n\n266\n00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.850\nGo ahead and update it right now.\n\n267\n00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.840\nAnd once you do,\nyou'll now have access to this.\n\n268\n00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.630\nNow Cherokee might actually see that\nthis looks a little bit familiar.\n\n269\n00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.930\nHere, at ITProTV, we use Dropbox.\n\n270\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.060\n&gt;&gt; A similar solution.\n\n271\n00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually does\nbecome a similar solution.\n\n272\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.290\nAnd now you can see that this OneDrive for\nBusiness is up to date.\n\n273\n00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:28.130\nIf I wanted to, I simply click on that,\nand now there it is.\n\n274\n00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.980\nI now have access to the OneDrive.\n\n275\n00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.280\nAnd now these files will actually end up\nbeing synchronized if we choose that.\n\n276\n00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.690\nSo if I select the Documents file,\nsee if I can open this in a new window so\n\n277\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.260\nthat we can see it.\n\n278\n00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.240\nI can now select that Test2 and\nbring it in there.\n\n279\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.010\nAnd now you can see,\n\n280\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.710\nit's now on this computer as well\nas up in the OneDrive cloud.\n\n281\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.780\nSo now we're actually\nbeing able to do that, and\n\n282\n00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.170\nthat will synchronize changes\nbetween them, as well.\n\n283\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.540\n&gt;&gt; And it's pretty cool how it's just\nintegrated right into File Explorer.\n\n284\n00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.710\nSo it seems pretty seemless as far as it\nbeing part of your operating system there.\n\n285\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like using it this way, too.\n\n286\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.730\nI don't synchronize everything\nthat we have because it's a large,\n\n287\n00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.980\ngigantic library.\n\n288\n00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.760\nBut I can pick and choose and\ndo what we call a selective sync here.\n\n289\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.025\nAnd that's what we've done at this point,\n\n290\n00:17:14.025 --> 00:17:14.834\ncuz [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n291\n00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:19.289\nyou bring up a good point because what if\nI have a tremendous amount of information\n\n292\n00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:21.200\nthat my organization is sharing?\n\n293\n00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.090\nI probably don't wanna pool all that\ndata onto my individual machine,\n\n294\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:24.830\nmy laptop or something.\n\n295\n00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could overwhelm your laptop,\n\n296\n00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.930\nespecially if you have more data up there\nthan what the size of your hard drive is.\n\n297\n00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.360\nThat's never a good thing, and\n\n298\n00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.570\nit will crash your laptop after\na while if you give it a chance to.\n\n299\n00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.010\nOr at least it will stop after a while.\n\n300\n00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.490\nSo this is something that you\ndo have to be aware of, right?\n\n301\n00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:46.320\nThe ability to pull those up,\nI'm neglecting the actual\n\n302\n00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.080\nPowerShell information for\nright now because it's a simple copy\n\n303\n00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.720\nand store in one location to the other.\n\n304\n00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.920\nBut it's something that you can do if you\nreally like running the PowerShell script.\n\n305\n00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.050\nThis is just an easy way that\nyou can show an end user\n\n306\n00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.180\nhow to run this if you need to.\n\n307\n00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.170\nNow if you are migrating everything for\n\n308\n00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:10.420\nthe user instead, you might want to\nscript it out inside of PowerShell.\n\n309\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.770\nAnd get all their files and\n\n310\n00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.560\nmigrate that up the way that you want to,\nas well, okay?\n\n311\n00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.227\nSo that at least gives you an example or\ndemonstration of fairly simply doing that.\n\n312\n00:18:20.227 --> 00:18:24.190\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, the next topic we have\non our list is Office 365 Video.\n\n313\n00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.383\nThis is a brand new term for me, so\nhopefully you can shed some light on this.\n\n314\n00:18:27.383 --> 00:18:33.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of strange at the same\ntime that video has become so important.\n\n315\n00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.930\nAnd that's what we are doing right here,\nright?\n\n316\n00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:38.570\nThe very fact is that now\nthe content that you used to go and\n\n317\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:43.680\nsit in the classroom for you can get it\nstreaming live if you're watching live?\n\n318\n00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.450\nOr you can go and\ndownload it from our library.\n\n319\n00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.840\nOr you can watch it from our library,\nas well.\n\n320\n00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:54.460\nAnd now inside of Office 365, with those\nhigher-paid premium accounts, those paid\n\n321\n00:18:54.460 --> 00:19:00.820\naccounts, you can also get access to what\nwe call the Office 365 Video here, okay?\n\n322\n00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.180\nThis allows you to literally create videos\n\n323\n00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:08.330\nthat you can share out inside of\nyour organization if you choose to.\n\n324\n00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.250\nStore them up in the cloud so\nthat it's readily and easily available.\n\n325\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:17.250\nNow in the background, this is using\nthe Azure CDN to help you to do this.\n\n326\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.860\nAnd the advantage of\nthis is that you're not\n\n327\n00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.930\nhaving to pay besides what your\nsubscription is to store it.\n\n328\n00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.150\nAnd to transcode it, and\n\n329\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.250\nto do all that stuff that makes\nit easy for viewing, okay?\n\n330\n00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.650\nSo without that, you normally have to\npay a separate service to do that.\n\n331\n00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:37.720\nAnd then you'd have to be able to get all\nthe stuff done the way that you need to.\n\n332\n00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.010\n&gt;&gt; So I can only imagine,\nif we are getting this storage space,\n\n333\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.530\nis there any kinda cap or\nlimit to what we're seeing here?\n\n334\n00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.460\n&gt;&gt; There probably is a cap or\nlimit, that's not been set up, yet.\n\n335\n00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.310\nAnd they'll probably announce\nit once you hit the limit.\n\n336\n00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.110\nMost people are not doing this\nbecause it takes a bit of time for\n\n337\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.950\nthat video to get encoded.\n\n338\n00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.600\nSo this is not like a free-for-all,\nif you had 100 videos and\n\n339\n00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.740\nyou want to upload them immediately.\n\n340\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.400\nIt takes time for each one of those videos\nto get transcoded and then up there.\n\n341\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.540\nMore than likely, it's gonna be\na limit in terms of how much you're\n\n342\n00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.590\nwilling to pay for storage is what you're\nactually going to end up seeing here.\n\n343\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.660\nBut this is based on whether or\nnot you have an E-based plan or\n\n344\n00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.490\nan A-based plan, the academic plans,\nis where they actually tend to shine\n\n345\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.920\na little bit more when you\nstart to do this, okay?\n\n346\n00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.830\nSo you have a portal then that\nallows you just to do this.\n\n347\n00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.620\nAnd let me show you where that is.\n\n348\n00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.080\nLet me click here on\nthe Office to get us back.\n\n349\n00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.100\nLet me shut out some of the stuff here,\n\n350\n00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.700\nand we'll have to go\nback to SharePoint again.\n\n351\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.130\nI know you're gonna find that string,\nwhy did I have to go to SharePoint?\n\n352\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.530\nWe'll see that in a moment.\n\n353\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.354\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But overall though,\n\n354\n00:20:41.354 --> 00:20:46.599\nif I were to start working with this,\nit's fairly easy to do.\n\n355\n00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:51.578\nLet's see, where is the 365 Video-\n&gt;&gt; I'm not really sure what that\n\n356\n00:20:51.578 --> 00:20:52.132\nicon looks like.\n\n357\n00:20:52.132 --> 00:20:54.890\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] There it is, yep,\nit actually looks like a V, for video.\n\n358\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.720\nSo I just have to look for\n\n359\n00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.534\nit, who would have thought that\nit came after D for delve?\n\n360\n00:21:01.534 --> 00:21:03.611\nAnd the next word would be video?\n\n361\n00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:05.170\nAnd you'll see right here, look at that.\n\n362\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.790\nWe already have a test video that's\nactually been loaded up there.\n\n363\n00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.160\nSo this is what I did to make sure\nthat it actually ended up working.\n\n364\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.736\nSo I took an 18-second video from\nwhere I was working at my workstation.\n\n365\n00:21:16.736 --> 00:21:18.048\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, you got seven views, Ronnie.\n\n366\n00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:18.584\n&gt;&gt; I know, and\n\n367\n00:21:18.584 --> 00:21:19.926\nall seven of those are mine-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:21:19.926 --> 00:21:20.731\n&gt;&gt; Except for this one,\n\n369\n00:21:20.731 --> 00:21:22.140\nwhich is now viewing out.\n\n370\n00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.380\nAnd this is from my phone, I just\nwanted to see how it ended up working.\n\n371\n00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.256\nSo you can see, there it is, I'm looking,\na little bit of delay there.\n\n372\n00:21:28.256 --> 00:21:29.310\n&gt;&gt; Pixelated.\n\n373\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.460\n&gt;&gt; Yep, but there it is,\nI'm at my workstation.\n\n374\n00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.140\nThere is some information,\nI'm viewing around, and now you can see.\n\n375\n00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.909\n&gt;&gt; There's Thomas.\n\n376\n00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:37.835\n&gt;&gt; Yep, barely.\n\n377\n00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:41.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And all that, of course,\n\n378\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.650\nwhen you see the pixelation, it depends\non the connection that you have and\n\n379\n00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.010\neverything else, too.\n\n380\n00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.070\nBut it is,\nit's actually quite a good-quality\n\n381\n00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.870\nvideo that's actually\nloaded up there to do this.\n\n382\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.690\nYou can manage it.\n\n383\n00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.670\nYou can also end up having, of course,\n\n384\n00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.440\nall the metadata that comes\nalong with that, as well.\n\n385\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.460\nIt's searchable,\nthen you can share this link out, as well.\n\n386\n00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.430\nAnd allow other people to connect in,\nI didn't mean to run it again.\n\n387\n00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.460\nYou can even put it in different channels.\n\n388\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.031\nAnd this one is on the Joey channel for\nright now.\n\n389\n00:22:12.031 --> 00:22:16.090\nSo that's only his channel,\nall his videos are my videos.\n\n390\n00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.720\nAnd then of course,\nthere's one that you put in the Community.\n\n391\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.098\nAnd nothing's been uploaded here yet,\nbut it does take a little bit of time.\n\n392\n00:22:23.098 --> 00:22:26.266\nEven that 18-second video,\nI can't remember,\n\n393\n00:22:26.266 --> 00:22:29.770\nI think it almost took 20 minutes for me.\n\n394\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.228\nAnd that of course, depends on how many\npeople are using it at the same time.\n\n395\n00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:36.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm just kinda curious, I wonder\nif you decide to move platforms and\n\n396\n00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.930\nsay cancel your Office\n365 membership here.\n\n397\n00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.690\nIf that encoding would affect it\nanother way, in which you store it.\n\n398\n00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, it could, but I doubt it, okay?\n\n399\n00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:51.040\nCuz they probably try to use the most\ncommon transcoding that they can.\n\n400\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.029\nSo the only thing you'd probably have to\ndo is make sure that you have a copy of\n\n401\n00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.788\nit, download it.\n\n402\n00:22:54.788 --> 00:22:57.814\nAnd if you end up not paying for\nthat subscription to store it for a while,\n\n403\n00:22:57.814 --> 00:23:01.270\nit will probably end up disappearing\nafter a while, anyways, okay?\n\n404\n00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.920\nSo let's talk about the idea of\ngetting this setup just briefly for\n\n405\n00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.790\nour organization here.\n\n406\n00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:11.344\nNow like everything else, you would\nthink that then all you have to do is,\n\n407\n00:23:11.344 --> 00:23:15.548\nif you need to set this up for\nyour organization, you select Admin.\n\n408\n00:23:15.548 --> 00:23:18.870\nAnd that, of course,\nbrings you to the Office Admin center.\n\n409\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.650\nAnd once you're inside the Office Admin\ncenter, you would, of course,\n\n410\n00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.310\ngo down to Admin centers.\n\n411\n00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.995\nAnd Cherokee,\nthis is where I get confused again.\n\n412\n00:23:27.995 --> 00:23:30.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because I end up looking for, well,\n\n413\n00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.530\nAdmin center for video.\n\n414\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.421\nAnd I'm gonna find something else,\nit's not here.\n\n415\n00:23:35.421 --> 00:23:35.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n416\n00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.980\n&gt;&gt; There is no Admin center for video.\n\n417\n00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.261\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda like Where's Waldo,\nbut without Waldo.\n\n418\n00:23:40.261 --> 00:23:43.190\n&gt;&gt; It pretty much is exactly like that.\n\n419\n00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.890\nAnd it's not even that Where's Waldo,\nWaldo is even in there.\n\n420\n00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.416\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna give you a hint,\n\n421\n00:23:47.416 --> 00:23:50.045\nyou're not ever gonna find\nhim because he's not in here.\n\n422\n00:23:50.045 --> 00:23:51.535\nWhere in the world do you have to go?\n\n423\n00:23:51.535 --> 00:23:56.535\nWhat my default now is, if I can find\nan Admin center from it, where am I going?\n\n424\n00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:57.130\nSharePoint.\n\n425\n00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.623\n[LAUGH] Who would have guessed?\n\n426\n00:23:58.623 --> 00:23:59.886\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n427\n00:23:59.886 --> 00:24:03.411\n&gt;&gt; I mean of all of the the things\nin the world that you would\n\n428\n00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:06.169\nguard where in the world\nwould a setting for\n\n429\n00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:10.650\nOffice 365 video be besides\nan Office 365 admin server?\n\n430\n00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.055\nMy number one guess would\nhave never been SharePoint.\n\n431\n00:24:13.055 --> 00:24:14.597\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But that's exactly where it is.\n\n432\n00:24:14.597 --> 00:24:15.940\n&gt;&gt; And now everyone else knows.\n\n433\n00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.541\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so now you go inside\nof SharePoint Admin Center and\n\n434\n00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:22.612\nthen you come down to where it says,\nsettings.\n\n435\n00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.110\nAnd hopefully I've clicked on it.\n\n436\n00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.970\nOnce you actually get to settings\nthis is where you have to search.\n\n437\n00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.350\nAnd after a while you actually see and\n\n438\n00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.530\nwe've actually seen this before\nin a previous episode as well.\n\n439\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.720\nSo let me kind of pull it up right here.\n\n440\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.680\nNotice this one.\n\n441\n00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.250\nWe saw this in an earlier episode,\n\n442\n00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.410\nCherokee the Enterprise\nSocial Collaboration.\n\n443\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.162\nWe turn on Yammer if we're gonna use it.\n\n444\n00:24:46.162 --> 00:24:47.041\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we did.\n\n445\n00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:50.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but look right, down here.\n\n446\n00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:50.887\nLook at that.\n\n447\n00:24:50.887 --> 00:24:53.840\n[CROSSTALK] Streaming Video Service.\n\n448\n00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.390\nWho would've imagined that it would've\nbeen right here in SharePoint?\n\n449\n00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:02.010\nControl if videos are stored and\nstreamed from Azure Media Services.\n\n450\n00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.554\n&gt;&gt; I can assume this is\ndisabled by default.\n\n451\n00:25:04.554 --> 00:25:08.058\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is actually enabled as\nfar as I'm, it might be disabled,\n\n452\n00:25:08.058 --> 00:25:09.315\nI think it's enabled.\n\n453\n00:25:09.315 --> 00:25:09.949\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n454\n00:25:09.949 --> 00:25:11.763\nI don't remember if I\nactually turned it on,\n\n455\n00:25:11.763 --> 00:25:13.990\nI don't think I actually\nturned it on here.\n\n456\n00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:17.790\nSo unless I change something let me\nsee that I actually mark that out.\n\n457\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.690\nNo, it's, yeah, it's right here.\n\n458\n00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:25.264\nSo once you actually select that and\nyeah, mine says verify.\n\n459\n00:25:25.264 --> 00:25:28.050\nSo I made a note that\nverify that it is enabled.\n\n460\n00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:32.007\nIf you can't see your videos\nmore than likely it is disabled.\n\n461\n00:25:32.007 --> 00:25:33.898\nSo my note here that I created for\n\n462\n00:25:33.898 --> 00:25:38.290\nmyself says that just verify that\nit is enabled for streaming.\n\n463\n00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:42.067\nAnd once it's enabled for streaming,\nscroll down to the bottom click OK.\n\n464\n00:25:42.067 --> 00:25:48.752\nAnd once you have that this is\nwhen you get to go back now\n\n465\n00:25:48.752 --> 00:25:54.413\ninto well Office 365 and your video icon.\n\n466\n00:25:57.001 --> 00:25:58.530\nMaybe.\n\n467\n00:25:58.530 --> 00:25:59.260\n&gt;&gt; Maybe?\n\n468\n00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.870\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.563\n&gt;&gt; I know it's always a challenge here\n\n470\n00:26:02.563 --> 00:26:03.752\njust clicking on stuff.\n\n471\n00:26:05.816 --> 00:26:10.520\nFrom this point it probably will lead you\nthrough a menu, if I remember correctly.\n\n472\n00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.860\nIf not you just wanna go ahead and create\na new channel, is what you wanna do.\n\n473\n00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.670\nSo I clicked on channels up here and\nthen you would select a new channel.\n\n474\n00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.940\nPick a color, give it a name and this way\nyou create a new channel for yourself.\n\n475\n00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:28.550\nAnd once you have that\nchannel now you will actually\n\n476\n00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:33.200\nbe able to see your particular\nvideos right there.\n\n477\n00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:39.370\nNow the problem of course comes\nwhen you want to share that video\n\n478\n00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.300\nto get it out to where you want it to go.\n\n479\n00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:48.360\nSo normally if we do something like\nthat it's probably gonna be something\n\n480\n00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.882\non Yammer is what we would actually think,\nright?\n\n481\n00:26:50.882 --> 00:26:54.570\nThat's usually platform I see videos\nshared out on on my own Facebook.\n\n482\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.780\nSo I'm gonna say it might be\nsomething like on Yammer here.\n\n483\n00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.726\nSo if I now select Yammer.\n\n484\n00:26:59.726 --> 00:27:03.995\n&gt;&gt; Or perhaps even those groups that we\nhad talked about in the previous episode\n\n485\n00:27:03.995 --> 00:27:08.531\nwhere we could just kind of, in one fell\nswoop send out to multiple people instead\n\n486\n00:27:08.531 --> 00:27:10.550\nof sending them individually.\n\n487\n00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can do that as well.\n\n488\n00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:15.840\nBut here let's say that you wanted\nto actually get your videos here.\n\n489\n00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.920\nWell it doesn't look like it really\ngives me anything to be able to do this.\n\n490\n00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.970\nSo you might be going all right so\nwhat in the world has to happen.\n\n491\n00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.060\nThis is part of that\nenterprise social media,\n\n492\n00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.100\nthe one that I said that\nwe had seen earlier.\n\n493\n00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.620\nI don't have it actually enabled yet.\n\n494\n00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:37.230\nSo without that working I can't\neven share my videos on the Yammer\n\n495\n00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.550\nbecause Yammer officially isn't turned on.\n\n496\n00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:40.672\nNow is it receiving stuff?\n\n497\n00:27:40.672 --> 00:27:42.150\nYes, okay.\n\n498\n00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:42.720\nIt really is.\n\n499\n00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.310\nIt is still actually there.\n\n500\n00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.900\nBut as far as being able\nto use it widely and\n\n501\n00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.270\nin the ways that we want to\nsuch as including in video.\n\n502\n00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.400\nIf it's not turned on it won't be there.\n\n503\n00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.890\nSo we go back into SharePoint.\n\n504\n00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.570\nWe go back into settings.\n\n505\n00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.660\nAnd from there we look for\nthat enterprise social media service.\n\n506\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.220\nWe enable it and about 30 minutes later.\n\n507\n00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:07.040\nAnd when I timed it last time it was right\nat 30 minutes is what it actually took.\n\n508\n00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.620\nAnd then at that point I could\nactually go into Yammer and\n\n509\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.275\nactually share those videos.\n\n510\n00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:14.005\nAnd that would actually give\nme the ability to do so.\n\n511\n00:28:14.005 --> 00:28:18.411\n&gt;&gt; And someone in chat here has mentioned\nthat their video service is enabled and\n\n512\n00:28:18.411 --> 00:28:20.799\nthey haven't messed with the settings.\n\n513\n00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:25.225\nSo by default it looks like\nit is set to be enabled.\n\n514\n00:28:25.225 --> 00:28:30.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as far as that video service\nit is set to be enabled here but\n\n515\n00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.560\nthe Yammer service isn't.\n\n516\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.337\nSo if we wanna do that we'd\nactually have to do that and\n\n517\n00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:37.379\nthat would take about 30 minutes for\nus to go and do that.\n\n518\n00:28:37.379 --> 00:28:41.783\nBut once you have that up then you'll\nactually see icons for being able to share\n\n519\n00:28:41.783 --> 00:28:46.430\nthat video across your Yammer service\nif you want to do that as well, okay?\n\n520\n00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:50.800\nSo that at least gets us\nthrough taking a look at all of\n\n521\n00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.970\nthose different ways that we can\nstart sharing out information\n\n522\n00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:59.360\nincluding video now without you having\nto go to a third party provider.\n\n523\n00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.354\nSo you can see Microsoft is trying\nto be incredibly comprehensive here.\n\n524\n00:29:02.354 --> 00:29:06.450\nBecause they realize that with\nsomething like this now, inside of HR.\n\n525\n00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.470\nWhoever the HR person is they can\ncreate a short video on doing this.\n\n526\n00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.206\nAnd now they send it over to Yammer and\neverybody can actually simply watch that\n\n527\n00:29:16.206 --> 00:29:18.535\ninstead of having to bring them in,\ndo all that.\n\n528\n00:29:18.535 --> 00:29:21.090\nSay, here it is watch this\nwhen you get a chance.\n\n529\n00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:25.000\nIt's a five minute video on\nthe next step in your process of\n\n530\n00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.010\nmoving through our company and\njoining us on boarding.\n\n531\n00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.444\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Being a great member of our team,\n\n532\n00:29:29.444 --> 00:29:30.044\nright?\n\n533\n00:29:30.044 --> 00:29:31.870\nOne of those.\n&gt;&gt; That's it, yeah..\n\n534\n00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.450\nNo doubt, so\ngreat solutions that are here.\n\n535\n00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.840\nIt does take a little bit of trickiness.\n\n536\n00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.316\nRemember if you can't find what you think\nthat it's gonna be under take a look under\n\n537\n00:29:41.316 --> 00:29:42.420\nshare point in settings.\n\n538\n00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.248\nSee if you're actually gonna find that\nservice there to enable it if you need to.\n\n539\n00:29:46.248 --> 00:29:48.980\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie you've already showed\nus a ton of great tools but\n\n540\n00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.130\nI don't think we're quite finished yet.\n\n541\n00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.180\nMicrosoft offers additional solutions.\n\n542\n00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.516\nSo we'll go ahead and make sure that we\ncreate a, what are we on now, part four.\n\n543\n00:29:57.516 --> 00:29:58.155\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n544\n00:29:58.155 --> 00:30:00.274\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For our viewers and our members.\n\n545\n00:30:00.274 --> 00:30:03.764\nSo ladies and gentlemen stay tuned but\nfor this show we are going to sign out.\n\n546\n00:30:03.764 --> 00:30:05.746\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n547\n00:30:05.746 --> 00:30:08.714\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here

00:00:10.447\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.447 --> 00:00:12.912\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:16.370\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.120\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.900\nAnd in today's episode we are coming\nback at you with more of our 70 3:47,\n\n8\n00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.260\ndid I get that correct?\n\n9\n00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.844\nThere's so, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n10\n00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:26.270\n&gt;&gt; Many Microsoft nomenclatures out there.\n\n11\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.800\nIt's so hard to keep track of.\n\n12\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.380\nBut I got it right so thank goodness.\n\n13\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.980\nAnd of course joining us in the studio\ntoday is our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n14\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.960\nRonnie, welcome back man.\n\n15\n00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.520\nHow's it going?\n\n16\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.440\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you again for having me\nback on the show as we're continuing on\n\n17\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.710\nthe different collaborations solutions.\n\n18\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.375\nAnd yes we are a short mini series here\ngoing into a part four on multiple\n\n19\n00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:49.898\ncollaboration solutions in which\nwe find inside of Office 365.\n\n20\n00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:54.042\nSo we've really dived into several\ndifferent solutions for us,\n\n21\n00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:58.560\nespecially when it comes down to being\nable to work on files together and\n\n22\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.290\nOffice 365 is designed for that.\n\n23\n00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.720\nAnd one of the features that we\ndefinitely want to look into.\n\n24\n00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.990\nIt's one that most of us\nprobably have not dealt with or\n\n25\n00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.480\nheard about, which is called Delve\nis the one that it's called.\n\n26\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.080\nSo Daniel in your vast experience with\nworking with Microsoft products over\n\n27\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.980\na decade have you heard of Delve?\n\n28\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.710\n&gt;&gt; I cannot say that I have\nhonestly heard of Delve.\n\n29\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.300\nThat's definitely a new technology\n\n30\n00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.770\nI'm guessing that it is\na new technology [LAUGH].\n\n31\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.606\n&gt;&gt; It is a newer technology.\n\n32\n00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:31.669\nIt's something that Microsoft has\nbeen working on for a long time, and\n\n33\n00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:33.670\nit's something that they're very proud of.\n\n34\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.320\nAnd it's because it works like\na search engine but better.\n\n35\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.830\nAnd you might be wondering like why\nthe heck do they need a search engine?\n\n36\n00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.261\nThere's so\nmany good one out there like Bing [LAUGH].\n\n37\n00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:44.075\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n38\n00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:45.955\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something.\n\n39\n00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:48.820\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you have these things,\n\n40\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.890\nright, but overall, though, the reason why\nwe need especially in organizations like\n\n41\n00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.920\nOffice 365 is now that we're\nhaving that infrastructure where\n\n42\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.460\nthings are partially stored on premises,\nright?\n\n43\n00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.490\nAnd they may be in different locations\nthroughout the entire globe.\n\n44\n00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.780\nAnd we also, of course,\n\n45\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.900\nthen have our SharePoint sites in\nwhich data is now stored in the cloud.\n\n46\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.490\nMaybe we would have our\nown personal One Drive for\n\n47\n00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.900\nbusiness that we're also using for\ncollaboration.\n\n48\n00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.890\nWe of course have SharePoint\nsites that we can use.\n\n49\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.950\nAnd all of these technologies then, in\nwhich you store data in, and I'm not sure,\n\n50\n00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.500\nDaniel, have you ever just lost a file\njust by storing it somewhere and\n\n51\n00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.710\ngo where did I end up\nsaving that somewhere?\n\n52\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we've all\nprobably been down that road.\n\n53\n00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.130\nI put that on my external drive, did I\nsave it one of the multitude of cloud\n\n54\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.120\nstorages that I have available to me.\n\n55\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.480\nBecause everybody gives you a chunk\nof storage for free in nowadays like,\n\n56\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.330\nhey, free storage, I'm going to use it.\n\n57\n00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.050\n&gt;&gt; And it makes sense that we do so.\n\n58\n00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.830\nWhat makes it more difficult\nthough is that If you start\n\n59\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.940\nusing multiple products right?\n\n60\n00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.440\nYou have to go to each one those and\ngo where the heck is that located?\n\n61\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.240\nIt's not on this one.\n\n62\n00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.360\nLet me try and check at the drop box.\n\n63\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.180\nIt's not in the drop box.\n\n64\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.140\nIt's in my OneDrive.\n\n65\n00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.840\nLet me go and check in OneDrive,\nit's not there.\n\n66\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.819\nI'm going to check into this\none box whatever it might be.\n\n67\n00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.410\nThere's so many different places and\nlocations it could be.\n\n68\n00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.790\nAnd of course, you end up finding out\nthat it was stored on your computer\n\n69\n00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.630\nsitting right there.\n\n70\n00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.440\nAnd you probably didn't even consider that\nat some point that it might be there, or\n\n71\n00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.180\na thumb drive just like what\nDaniel is talking about.\n\n72\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.510\nWell, Delve has this ability for\n\n73\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.400\nus to be able to take everything that we\ncan find the availability of storage in,\n\n74\n00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.520\non one drive, just like I said,\nSharePoint sites.\n\n75\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.830\nIt might actually end up in your Yammer\nfolders or files that are there.\n\n76\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.710\nIt might be in your one drive for\nbusiness that you might end up with.\n\n77\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.550\nIt might be stored in Outlook somewhere.\n\n78\n00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.660\nAnd it gives you that ability to find\nthat information, regardless of what\n\n79\n00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.560\nproduct it might be stored in,\nthrough your Office 365 account.\n\n80\n00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.750\nNow, if you think about it, that's\npretty amazing because it really does\n\n81\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.390\nallow you then to not have to keep track\nof something that you go yeah I worked\n\n82\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.680\non that file but that was six months ago\nDaniel how do you expect me to find that?\n\n83\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.520\nWell now, Daniel can just go and\nfind delv and\n\n84\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.980\ndelv can actually help him to find\nthat information as he needs it, and\n\n85\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.070\nit even helps more especially\nin this age of collaboration.\n\n86\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.000\nBecause now we can actually take a look\nand see not only where the file's located,\n\n87\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.970\nbut who's actually worked on it.\n\n88\n00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.290\nHow long has it been?\n\n89\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.690\nHow long have they actually\nworked on that file?\n\n90\n00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.710\nIt gives a lot more information\nwhen you start looking for\n\n91\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.900\nthe information that you're\nnormally going to search for.\n\n92\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.962\n&gt;&gt; So it's a bounty hunter for\nfiles, skip bail.\n\n93\n00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:39.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually,\n\n94\n00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.160\nthat's a good way to think about it,\nright?\n\n95\n00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.930\nSo, the very fact is and\nknow how to find stuff and\n\n96\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.110\nmake it really kind of suited toward to\nwhat you're only normally going to need,\n\n97\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.930\nso and not only tracks those files for\nus Daniel but\n\n98\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.190\nit makes it track it by relevant see\nto us during that point in time or\n\n99\n00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.440\nbut whatever we type in that\nwe need to search for it for.\n\n100\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.510\nSo it really is kind of neat and\nbehind all of this as a technology and\n\n101\n00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.980\nI'm going to throw another\none at Daniel here.\n\n102\n00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.170\nOne that is called Office Graph.\n\n103\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.890\nHave you heard of Office Graph?\n\n104\n00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.065\n&gt;&gt; Office Graph?\n\n105\n00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:18.224\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n106\n00:05:18.224 --> 00:05:19.912\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; No I think that's also new to me\n\n107\n00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:20.420\nas well.\n\n108\n00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so now you're starting\nto see it's like this is not,\n\n109\n00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.490\nit's not kind of a repackaged something.\n\n110\n00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.060\nRight?\n\n111\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.850\nO yeah I remember that technology.\n\n112\n00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.300\nThis is something that\nthey're really proud of\n\n113\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.260\nin the way that they've been able to\nindex all of those different files and\n\n114\n00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.810\ndocuments and whatever it is across\nmultiple different products and\n\n115\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.020\nit brings it to us in this one format and\n\n116\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.140\nthen that way we can actually pull\nit up and don't matter if I'm.\n\n117\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.260\nIf I'm not in SharePoint.\n\n118\n00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.960\nIf it's in SharePoint it will find it.\n\n119\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.650\nIf I'm in Outlook it\nwill find it from there.\n\n120\n00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.960\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n121\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.520\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at how the technology ends up\n\n122\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.635\nplaying out at the beginning here and then\nwe're not gonna dive super deep into it\n\n123\n00:05:59.635 --> 00:06:04.520\nbecause it's normally on as long as\nyour company has the proper SKU or\n\n124\n00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.040\nthe proper subscription to\nbe able to access Delve.\n\n125\n00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.780\nAnd usually those are enterprise accounts,\nit's not going to be free versions,\n\n126\n00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.470\nit's not going to be the student version\nI think, you know stuff like that, but it\n\n127\n00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.380\nhas to be kind of at least the enterprise\naccount before you'll get access to this.\n\n128\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.226\nSo let's take a look,\nI've logged into the Office 365 portal.\n\n129\n00:06:22.226 --> 00:06:26.920\nFrom here, of course we have\nthe different management tiles\n\n130\n00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.888\nthat we have with every account and\nif you have the Dell account,\n\n131\n00:06:31.888 --> 00:06:36.780\nor the Dell product,\nit should show up right here in are tiles.\n\n132\n00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.229\nNow, like everything else Microsoft is so\nlogical about this that you would think,\n\n133\n00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.370\nhey this should in alphabetical order.\n\n134\n00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.356\nIt is not.\n\n135\n00:06:44.356 --> 00:06:44.982\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n136\n00:06:44.982 --> 00:06:49.513\nnotice you kind of have to, there it is-\n&gt;&gt; Well, searching around [INAUDIBLE].\n\n137\n00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:50.890\n&gt;&gt; It takes just a little bit of time.\n\n138\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.683\nI'm pretty sure there is a logic behind.\n\n139\n00:06:53.683 --> 00:06:54.595\nI don't know what it is.\n\n140\n00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:56.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I haven't figured it out yet.\n\n141\n00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.930\nBut I'm sure there is a logic behind why\nthey choose to do something like this\n\n142\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.205\ninstead of alphabetically,\nwhich most of us would find easier.\n\n143\n00:07:04.205 --> 00:07:06.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe there's a setting, right,\n\n144\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.345\nthat we can change.\n\n145\n00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:11.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here I'm going to select the Delve\n\n146\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.510\ntile, and once I do it's\ngoing to take me into Delve.\n\n147\n00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.360\nNow I don't if you noticed it or not,\nthis is something I've complaining about,\n\n148\n00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.686\nDaniel, during the entire series.\n\n149\n00:07:22.686 --> 00:07:27.840\nI don't want to say complain, but\nI should say I have been emphasizing\n\n150\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.450\nthat everything essentially\nwraps back around to SharePoint.\n\n151\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.810\nThat it really is so big into that.\n\n152\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:39.510\nAnd as the tab was changing you actually\nsaw where it actually started out and\n\n153\n00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.200\nwhat my-sharepoint, so you know that in\nthe background that there is part of that\n\n154\n00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.790\nsearching and\npart of office graph it says, well,\n\n155\n00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.900\nSharePoint is really kind of\nthe key to making all this work.\n\n156\n00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.720\nSo this is where you start.\n\n157\n00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.941\nSo, if delve is on, which it normally is,\nby default with those subscriptions,\n\n158\n00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:59.696\nyou can then see that you're going to\nend up in these popular documents.\n\n159\n00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:03.920\nAnd what it's saying is Ronnie,\nyou haven't given me enough information.\n\n160\n00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.781\nTo work through everything.\n\n161\n00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:09.061\nNow, there's some documentation\ninside of my Office 365 subscription,\n\n162\n00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:11.050\nthere's some different documents.\n\n163\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.400\nBut now it's starting to say, hey, there's\nnothing really popular at this point.\n\n164\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.520\nSo the more that you continue\nto work with it, and\n\n165\n00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.760\nthe more that you allow\nDelve to work with it.\n\n166\n00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.430\nYou're gonna see that it's gonna bring\nthose things to the surface here.\n\n167\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.140\nPopular is normally the first\ndefault page that we land on.\n\n168\n00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.100\nBut if I wanted to see something specific,\nlet's say for example for me.\n\n169\n00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.670\nI would just click on the icon over here\non the left-hand side that says Me, and\n\n170\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.060\nthis is represented by Joey at this point.\n\n171\n00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.210\nThen I can start seeing\na little bit more information.\n\n172\n00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.717\nGet back to your recent documents.\n\n173\n00:08:44.717 --> 00:08:48.095\nOthers will only see documents\nthat they have access to.\n\n174\n00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:49.760\nAnd this is what you have access to.\n\n175\n00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.860\nSo I've created several\ndifferent documents for\n\n176\n00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.030\nus to be able to take a look here too.\n\n177\n00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.690\nNow, the other advantage\nof Delve that we also have\n\n178\n00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.290\nis notice that down here in the lower\nquadrant that you see On my screen.\n\n179\n00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.880\nClick a person to see\nwhat they are working on.\n\n180\n00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.875\nSo if you go look,\nthey're supposed to be working on this and\n\n181\n00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:12.713\nthis is probably something\nyou might be thinking about.\n\n182\n00:09:12.713 --> 00:09:16.490\nOr you might go, hey I'm curious,\nwhat is Lance actually working on?\n\n183\n00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.521\nI can simply click his icon there,\nor his avatar.\n\n184\n00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:21.720\nAnd then we can also see,\n\n185\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.000\nhey, there's some of the other documents\nthat Lance has been working on, too.\n\n186\n00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.136\nIf he's my teammate and we're supposed\nto work on the same things, or\n\n187\n00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:31.380\nif I wanna know if he's\nreally busy at this point.\n\n188\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.711\nLance has been creating things like,\nTest1, but not super busy,\n\n189\n00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:37.204\nthat was three days ago.\n\n190\n00:09:37.204 --> 00:09:41.455\nAnd there really hasn't been a lot of\nactivity for Lance, so maybe I can get him\n\n191\n00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:46.230\nto join part of my team as I become\nbusier, and start to see information too.\n\n192\n00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.570\nSo you can of course be able to\ncommunicate with Lance through his\n\n193\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.450\nemail as well as the Skype for\nBusiness as well.\n\n194\n00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:58.160\nAnd even look into Lance's OneDrive if\nhe's shared out any documents to you.\n\n195\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.970\nSo it gives you some of that information\nthat we want to actually be able to see.\n\n196\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.130\nSo it does, it allows you to\nstay connected not only with\n\n197\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:11.240\nyour own documents a lot of times,\nbut even your teammate's documents.\n\n198\n00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.790\nIf you actually want to\nmake sure that you're\n\n199\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.110\nable to see all of this information.\n\n200\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:22.010\nNow, the neat thing that I like is\nwhere it says MyAnalytics, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:27.248\nRight over here on the left-hand side,\nif I select MyAnalytics,\n\n202\n00:10:27.248 --> 00:10:30.627\nthen I can start to see\nmy particular time.\n\n203\n00:10:30.627 --> 00:10:34.085\nMy stats are based on my email and\nmy calendar.\n\n204\n00:10:34.085 --> 00:10:36.050\nAnd I didn't really have a lot of this,\n\n205\n00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.745\nbut it actually pulled in all of my\ndockets, so you can see that meetings,\n\n206\n00:10:39.745 --> 00:10:42.690\nI haven't spent a lot of\ntime on meetings at all.\n\n207\n00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.448\nBut I can select meetings and\nselect Edit the goal.\n\n208\n00:10:45.448 --> 00:10:50.809\nAnd now it says set your\nweekly Meeting goals here,\n\n209\n00:10:50.809 --> 00:10:53.559\nless than how many hours?\n\n210\n00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:57.931\nAnd then it will track you based on your\ncalendar of how many meetings that you've\n\n211\n00:10:57.931 --> 00:10:58.777\nactually had.\n\n212\n00:10:58.777 --> 00:11:01.165\nSame thing with working on email as well.\n\n213\n00:11:01.165 --> 00:11:04.981\nFocus hours, and you can see that for\nmy Focus hours, pretty good.\n\n214\n00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:10.279\nAnd that's because this is the account\nthat I've pretty much been using for\n\n215\n00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:15.630\ntesting as well as for\ndemonstrating during the 70-347 series.\n\n216\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.600\nSo the focus hours are pretty high when\nyou start seeing what I have there.\n\n217\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.800\nAnd then of course, oops, trying to\nscroll over to the right a little bit so\n\n218\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.120\nthat we can see everything.\n\n219\n00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.580\nAnd then even After hours report, too.\n\n220\n00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.510\nOf course if I scroll down we'll\nalso end up seeing other things,\n\n221\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:39.120\nsuch as what's important,\nwho to stay in touch with as well.\n\n222\n00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.600\nAnd then Top collaborators if I\nhad any collaboration going on,\n\n223\n00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.110\nwhich I don't have any at this point.\n\n224\n00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.470\nI can actually see that information too.\n\n225\n00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.100\nSo when you begin to say,\nhey, I need to work.\n\n226\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.029\nI need to be able to find\nall these documents and\n\n227\n00:11:53.029 --> 00:11:54.471\nthey're starting to spread out.\n\n228\n00:11:54.471 --> 00:11:56.631\nYou start realizing that you've saved so\nmany things and\n\n229\n00:11:56.631 --> 00:11:58.027\nyou can't remember where they are.\n\n230\n00:11:58.027 --> 00:12:03.310\nDelve is probably gonna be the tool in\nOffice 365 that you will depend on.\n\n231\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.650\nBut that means that we have\nto know two things about how\n\n232\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:12.500\nto let Delve find the information that\nit needs to find correctly, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.340\nSo the way that we do this,\nit really depends on our\n\n234\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.980\npurpose of trying to get the information.\n\n235\n00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.089\nAnd since we're talking\nabout collaboration,\n\n236\n00:12:23.089 --> 00:12:24.845\nthere's a couple of ways we can do this.\n\n237\n00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:28.434\nIf we're just sharing out the files, well,\n\n238\n00:12:28.434 --> 00:12:33.070\nwe can always just use our own\nOneDrive to share out files.\n\n239\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.167\nAnd then that way all we do is we grant\npermission to whoever needs to share that\n\n240\n00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:38.818\nout, and that's no big deal.\n\n241\n00:12:38.818 --> 00:12:41.520\nBut that's not gonna get\ntracked in Delve too much.\n\n242\n00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.479\nBut as long as you are using something\nlike Yammer, so Yammer's a big one.\n\n243\n00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:51.027\nSharePoint, collection sites,\nthe OneDrive for Business itself,\n\n244\n00:12:51.027 --> 00:12:54.970\nOutlook, you name it,\nthose are kind of the big ones there.\n\n245\n00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.520\nSharePoint and Yammer, OneDrive for\nBusiness, and Outlook.\n\n246\n00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.213\nIf you are using all of those,\nDelve will begin to help you.\n\n247\n00:13:03.213 --> 00:13:07.658\nBecause it actually now takes a look at\nthe collaboration between multiple people.\n\n248\n00:13:07.658 --> 00:13:10.711\nAnd then the more often that you're\nactually doing that it's gonna start\n\n249\n00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:11.950\nshowing up here, more data.\n\n250\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.321\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, is there one of those products\nthat would probably be better suited for\n\n251\n00:13:15.321 --> 00:13:16.590\nusing Delve than the others?\n\n252\n00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:21.100\nLike should I be, yeah all these work but\nthis really works kind of thing?\n\n253\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.680\n&gt;&gt; No, that's the neat thing about it.\n\n254\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.850\nSo like me, I always go of course,\nSharePoint, because that's what's on\n\n255\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:30.490\nthe back end of it\n&gt;&gt; But it really has kind of woven itself\n\n256\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.370\ninto all the products\ninside of Office 365.\n\n257\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.880\nThat, and then along with\nthe introduction of Office Graph.\n\n258\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.800\nThat's made it very much a tool that\ncan reach across those elements.\n\n259\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.740\nSo we don't have to worry about that.\n\n260\n00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.083\nNow there is kind of a little bit\nof a caveat here though, okay?\n\n261\n00:13:48.083 --> 00:13:51.257\nAs you start using this,\nespecially with documents,\n\n262\n00:13:51.257 --> 00:13:56.018\nit may not show up immediately in Delve,\nokay, so even if you start storing them.\n\n263\n00:13:56.018 --> 00:13:59.087\nAnd that's because it's\na cloud technology, and\n\n264\n00:13:59.087 --> 00:14:04.300\nit takes time because it's spread out\nall over their data centers everywhere.\n\n265\n00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.717\nThat it might take, let me see,\nmake sure I say up to an hour.\n\n266\n00:14:07.717 --> 00:14:11.045\nOkay, so I was thinking there's something\nelse we're going to talk about that's\n\n267\n00:14:11.045 --> 00:14:12.817\ngoing to take a little\nbit longer time here.\n\n268\n00:14:12.817 --> 00:14:15.137\nSo 30 minutes or 24 hours,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n269\n00:14:15.137 --> 00:14:16.850\nI was doing some other studying here.\n\n270\n00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.280\nBut up to about an hour before\neverything may show up.\n\n271\n00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:25.480\nSo don't be surprised if\nsomething doesn't show up in Delve\n\n272\n00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.700\nright away because it's indexing\neverything is what's happening here.\n\n273\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.680\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, really quickly, when I do\nactually share something out is it gonna\n\n274\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.660\nshow up immediately in Delve or\ndo I have to wait a while?\n\n275\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.200\n&gt;&gt; You may have to wait up until about\nan hour before anything shows up.\n\n276\n00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.940\nAnd that is because you are working\nin a cloud technology here and\n\n277\n00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.940\nthe data centers are pretty\nmuch everywhere on the planet.\n\n278\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.568\nSo before everything can get\nstructured out and then indexed, right?\n\n279\n00:14:52.568 --> 00:14:55.670\nWhich it's indexing a lot, it's not\nonly your files but everything else.\n\n280\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.178\nIt may take a little bit\nof time before it shows up.\n\n281\n00:14:58.178 --> 00:15:00.013\nBut once it shows up,\nit's going be there and\n\n282\n00:15:00.013 --> 00:15:02.348\nyou're going to actually be\nvery appreciative of this.\n\n283\n00:15:02.348 --> 00:15:06.500\nEspecially if you start working in\na tremendous amount of documents.\n\n284\n00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.180\nNow me on the show, I might have\ncreated 20 documents altogether.\n\n285\n00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.020\nAnd in that,\nDelve is not gonna really be helpful.\n\n286\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.746\nBut for those of you that are constantly\nworking where you're collaborating on\n\n287\n00:15:17.746 --> 00:15:22.487\nmultiple teams, where you're creating 50,\n60 documents a week or a day.\n\n288\n00:15:22.487 --> 00:15:24.848\nAnd you're not exactly\nsure where they are.\n\n289\n00:15:24.848 --> 00:15:27.580\nDelve is gonna be one of\nthose primary solutions for\n\n290\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.170\nyou that is really going to help you out.\n\n291\n00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.510\nJust make sure you understand that,\nin the background, when you do this.\n\n292\n00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.520\nThere's not a lot of configuration for\n\n293\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.940\nus, when it come down to Delve\nin the administration side.\n\n294\n00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.136\nThe whole key here, of course, is just to\nunderstand what the key technology is, and\n\n295\n00:15:44.136 --> 00:15:47.010\nwhy it's something that we\nwould choose to be able to use.\n\n296\n00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:51.376\nAnd understand that where our files\nare gonna be placed is how Delve gets\n\n297\n00:15:51.376 --> 00:15:56.353\nthe information it needs to to give you a\nbetter solution to find all of that data.\n\n298\n00:15:56.353 --> 00:16:01.251\nSo that is pretty much the, one of the\nother components of collaboration that we\n\n299\n00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:06.250\nreally wanted to make sure that we took\nat least a little bit of a dive into.\n\n300\n00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.434\nTo understand what goes on.\n\n301\n00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:12.676\nNow the other technology that\nwe also need to be familiar with\n\n302\n00:16:12.676 --> 00:16:17.640\nis something that is really helpful\nin terms of security, okay.\n\n303\n00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.590\nAnd we're starting to\nhear this term over and\n\n304\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:24.435\nover again because of the concentration\nnow on cybersecurity, right.\n\n305\n00:16:24.435 --> 00:16:28.070\nCybersecurity big new term on\nunderstanding security and\n\n306\n00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.480\nthe implications there and\n\n307\n00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.180\nthe key term here is what we call\ndata lost prevention or DLP.\n\n308\n00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:40.610\nYou'll hear both of them relatively often\ntoday as you're starting to work more and\n\n309\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.650\nmore in the cloud as well as with\ndocument that you have on hand.\n\n310\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:49.230\nBut this is really a big\nsecurity thing that we have to at\n\n311\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.560\nleast give some consideration to.\n\n312\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:58.341\nAnd understand how Office 365 helps us\nout in terms of data loss prevention.\n\n313\n00:16:58.341 --> 00:17:03.842\nSo when we start talking about\nthis idea of data loss prevention,\n\n314\n00:17:03.842 --> 00:17:07.090\nit sounds logical enough, right.\n\n315\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:11.650\nThe very fact is what we're saying\nis we don't want to lose data, and\n\n316\n00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:17.100\ntraditionally in the background,\nwhen I thought about this, especially when\n\n317\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.740\nI began my security professional career,\nin that sense.\n\n318\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.310\nThe only thing I really thought about,\nDaniel,\n\n319\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.070\nwas the idea of just running backups.\n\n320\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:30.010\nAnd that was kind of what I thought of\nis data lost prevention itself, but\n\n321\n00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.200\ntoday we're finding out that it they\nmean a lot more than that right?\n\n322\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're talking hot sites,\ndisaster recovery sites,\n\n323\n00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.530\nreplication tons of technologies\nthat go into making sure\n\n324\n00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:46.550\nthat data is available As fast and\nas with as much integrity as possible.\n\n325\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so when we start taking\na look at the technological side and\n\n326\n00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.630\nthe administrative side there's a lot\nof technology that goes into the back\n\n327\n00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.500\nend of that and not just simple backups.\n\n328\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.400\nBut this data loss prevention\nhelps us out in another way.\n\n329\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.220\nNot only thinking about making sure\nwe're running good backups and\n\n330\n00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.050\nthat we have all our\ninformation backed up.\n\n331\n00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.760\nBecause they're running on multiple sites,\nit's gonna be backed up.\n\n332\n00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.090\nWe're not so worried about that too much.\n\n333\n00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:15.340\nBut what we're really worried about,\nright, is the mistaking, or\n\n334\n00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.080\nthe ignorance, I hate to say that word,\nbut it works here.\n\n335\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.650\nOf somebody who accidentally\nforwards a email\n\n336\n00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.950\nof stuff that is not supposed to be\nforwarded out of the company, right?\n\n337\n00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.350\nSo when you start thinking about stuff\nlike that, stuff that says private,\n\n338\n00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:34.710\ndo not forward and somebody accidentally\nhits forward and there it goes.\n\n339\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:40.360\nIt's out in the email and now your\nproprietary data is exposed out there.\n\n340\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.685\nAnd so when we have stuff like that, that\nbecomes a little bit more frightening.\n\n341\n00:18:43.685 --> 00:18:45.948\nBut you gotta think that in this day and\n\n342\n00:18:45.948 --> 00:18:51.090\nage when we're working with cloud\ntechnology, how much easier that is right?\n\n343\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.950\nSo Daniel in the early days\nwhen we talk about just email\n\n344\n00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.010\nwe had our own email server inside.\n\n345\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.100\nWe could set up things and\ngo we would never allow that to happen.\n\n346\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.400\nBut now that things might be\non-premises and then in the cloud,\n\n347\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.340\nthe challenge might actually take\non a little bit more at this point.\n\n348\n00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.540\nAnd that's what we have to realize here\ntoo, is that that particular idea,\n\n349\n00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.240\nespecially when everything\nresides in the cloud,\n\n350\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.930\nif you said, we're pretty much\noffloading everything up to Office 365,\n\n351\n00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:22.400\nis there a way that we can\nprevent this from happening?\n\n352\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.670\nAnd the great thing is there is, and\n\n353\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.350\nthat's what we wanna make\nsure that we understand.\n\n354\n00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.560\nSo when do worry about is somebody\ngonna accidentally forward my data\n\n355\n00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.910\nout of my business?\n\n356\n00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:38.140\nAnd it can happen not only by accident but\nit could be intentional as well and\n\n357\n00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.780\na attacker could actually\ndo something like this\n\n358\n00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:46.130\nto the point were it becomes\nmuch more malicious that point.\n\n359\n00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.810\nAnd that's something we also want\nto make sure that we understand and\n\n360\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.350\ntake a look at.\n\n361\n00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:54.181\nSo let's talk about a couple of different\nways where we can actually think about\n\n362\n00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:57.580\nthis too and what we're normally\nalso trying to protect.\n\n363\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.630\nSo when it comes to data loss prevention,\nyou can protect anything that you want to,\n\n364\n00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.050\nguarantee it.\n\n365\n00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.231\nBut most of the time what\nare we worried about?\n\n366\n00:20:05.231 --> 00:20:09.330\nFinancial data,\npersonally identifiable data, okay?\n\n367\n00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.180\nThose are the types of things\nthat we're normally looking at.\n\n368\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:18.030\nSo, here in the United States, especially\nthings like our account numbers and\n\n369\n00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.872\nour own Social Security\nnumber are also part of it.\n\n370\n00:20:22.872 --> 00:20:27.030\nHealthcare information, you name it,\ncredit card information.\n\n371\n00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.298\nAny of this stuff that really we don't\nwant to kinda spread out over a public\n\n372\n00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:35.835\nviewing, well, this is stuff that we\ndon't want to get out, if it's actually\n\n373\n00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:40.467\nsupposed to be something I'm supposed to\nbe in charge of and keep charge of that.\n\n374\n00:20:40.467 --> 00:20:45.369\nI need to have something in place in my\nOffice 365 solution that may actually\n\n375\n00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:50.340\nhelp us out so that we don't end up\ndoing something like that as well.\n\n376\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.660\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look\nat a couple of options that we have.\n\n377\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:01.080\nOne is the idea of running what we call\nMicrosoft Azure Information Protection.\n\n378\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.980\nNow, that's a mouthful, isn't it, Daniel?\n\n379\n00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\n\n380\n00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.960\n&gt;&gt; The love the crazy long names\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n381\n00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.160\nthen you have to shorten that down to\nan acronym and remember what it means.\n\n382\n00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and this is where it\nbecomes trickier for the exam.\n\n383\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.800\nAnd the reason why I said it that way, the\nMicrosoft Azure information Protection,\n\n384\n00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:24.430\nit's strange because in\nthe earlier editions of\n\n385\n00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.305\nOffice365 It was just called\nAzure Rights Management, so.\n\n386\n00:21:28.305 --> 00:21:34.080\n[LAUGH] Why not make an acronym harder,\nthan anything else that we have?\n\n387\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.810\nSo you have to be able to\nfind this information,\n\n388\n00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.270\nand I can't tell you which version\non the exam, which one you'll get.\n\n389\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.883\nBut if you hear the term\nAzure Rights Management,\n\n390\n00:21:43.883 --> 00:21:48.278\nand you also hear\nMicrosoft Azure Information Protection.\n\n391\n00:21:48.278 --> 00:21:52.700\nIt's kind of about the same information as\nwhat we're taking a look at here, okay?\n\n392\n00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.770\nSo with the latest editions,\n\n393\n00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:58.490\nyou'll hear the Microsoft\nAzure Information Protection.\n\n394\n00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.750\nAnd so, you've got to just deal with that.\n\n395\n00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.620\nIt's just the way it's\ngonna be in one way or\n\n396\n00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.890\nthe other when you're getting ready for\nthe exam.\n\n397\n00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.310\nSo what do we need to do when we start\nto take a look at something like that.\n\n398\n00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.480\nWell, rights management, okay?\n\n399\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.860\nIs really again helping essentially\nthe end users to be able\n\n400\n00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:22.330\nto not have to worry about accidentally\nforwarding something out of the company.\n\n401\n00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:28.120\nNow it brings you peace of mind but\nmost of the time when that is something\n\n402\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.980\npolicy driven like the way that we do it,\nthe user is just given a warning.\n\n403\n00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.340\nBut in this way if you want to start\ntalking about Azure rights management, we\n\n404\n00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:43.480\nreally do let the end user see right there\nthat this is not going to be that way.\n\n405\n00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.950\nSo that way they have that, when they try\nto forward it by accident, it's gonna tell\n\n406\n00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.880\nthem, you're not supposed to do this,\nbecause the data cannot exist when you\n\n407\n00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.920\nsend, or is not gonna be there if you try\nto send it outside of this organization.\n\n408\n00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.160\nOr the data's not gonna be available\nto be sent outside the organization.\n\n409\n00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.100\nWhatever it is it really does prevent\nthat, and that is a nice thing to do,\n\n410\n00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:10.380\nright is to let the end user really\nknow what's going on in that point.\n\n411\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.160\nSo let's go ahead and set that up first so\n\n412\n00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.730\nthat we can at least see\nwhere you configure that.\n\n413\n00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.270\nSo let's go back to my screen and\n\n414\n00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.800\non my screen I'm going to\nclick on the Admin tile.\n\n415\n00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.490\nThat should of course\nbring us this list and\n\n416\n00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.200\nyou kind of saw the screen\npop out a little bit and\n\n417\n00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.210\nthen it reduced itself and that's\nbecause of the resolution that I have.\n\n418\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.130\nSo that you're able to see my\nscreen without having to squint.\n\n419\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:32.870\nSo mine's lower,\n\n420\n00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:36.670\nif your's is actually higher you'll\nsee the label beside the little icon.\n\n421\n00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:41.206\nBut where I'm going is I'm going to\nselect then where's actually the word\n\n422\n00:23:41.206 --> 00:23:44.950\nSettings and this is little gear\nthat you see right here is what\n\n423\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.706\nyou see if you have a real low\nresolution like I have right now.\n\n424\n00:23:48.706 --> 00:23:52.034\nI'm going to also select\nServices &amp; add-ins and\n\n425\n00:23:52.034 --> 00:23:56.469\ninside of Services &amp; add-ins,\nthis is where we would normally,\n\n426\n00:23:56.469 --> 00:24:02.170\nat one point in time, we would have\nlooked for Azure rights management.\n\n427\n00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.608\nBut today, we don't get to look for\nAzure rights management.\n\n428\n00:24:05.608 --> 00:24:12.770\nWhat we get to look for instead is\nMicrosoft Azure information protection.\n\n429\n00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:17.680\nYeah, that rolls right off the tongue\nlike nothing else in this world.\n\n430\n00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.564\nBut that is the one that we're looking for\nright there.\n\n431\n00:24:20.564 --> 00:24:28.470\nIf I select the Azure information, now it\nlets us know, offline or online, right?\n\n432\n00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.484\nWith Microsoft Azure\nInformation Protection,\n\n433\n00:24:31.484 --> 00:24:36.710\nyou can add another layer of protection to\nyour data that you store in Office 365.\n\n434\n00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:41.820\nThe rules you set protect your\nfiles whether they're being viewed.\n\n435\n00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:47.090\nWhether they're viewed using Office\nonline, or downloaded to a user's device.\n\n436\n00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:51.499\nPolicies and encryption let you\nsafely share the files in email or\n\n437\n00:24:51.499 --> 00:24:55.122\nOneDrive and\nsafeguard confidential information.\n\n438\n00:24:55.122 --> 00:24:57.580\nSo this sounds like a good idea.\n\n439\n00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.390\nSo what are we gonna do?\n\n440\n00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.334\nWe're gonna click right here\non these protection settings.\n\n441\n00:25:01.334 --> 00:25:02.694\nAnd then when you do so\n\n442\n00:25:02.694 --> 00:25:07.240\nthis is where you'll actually just\nget a button that you get to choose.\n\n443\n00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.695\nAnd you'll see that right here in rights\nmanagement they left this part exactly\n\n444\n00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:15.620\nthe way that it should be,\nwhich is the rights management.\n\n445\n00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.580\nAnd there it tells you,\nrights management is not activated.\n\n446\n00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.040\nSo if rights management is not activated,\nyou're not gonna be able to use this.\n\n447\n00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.450\nSo there we go,\nit safeguards emails, documents,\n\n448\n00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.380\nhelps you securely share this\ndata with your colleagues.\n\n449\n00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.810\nSo all I have to do is select Activate,\nand\n\n450\n00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.444\nnow it asks me if I want\nto be able to use this.\n\n451\n00:25:36.444 --> 00:25:40.090\nNow, this is not gonna be\na free feature either, okay?\n\n452\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.970\nSo you do need to remember\nthat It will probably be at\n\n453\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.200\nleast the enterprise types of\naccounts before you'll get this.\n\n454\n00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.745\nSo the business premium may not have this,\nbut usually the enterprise ones do.\n\n455\n00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:54.723\nWhen RMS, or the rights management,\nwhen you activate it,\n\n456\n00:25:54.723 --> 00:26:00.183\nyour organization can start to protect\nimportant documents an email is using RMS,\n\n457\n00:26:00.183 --> 00:26:05.424\nthis information protection solution\nintegrates with applications, okay?\n\n458\n00:26:05.424 --> 00:26:09.310\nExchange Online, SharePoint Online,\nShareExchange, and Microsoft SharePoint.\n\n459\n00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:13.794\nYou know it, so of course we want it to\ngo ahead and activate is what we want\n\n460\n00:26:13.794 --> 00:26:17.854\nto be able to do, so now it's\nverifying that everything is good.\n\n461\n00:26:17.854 --> 00:26:21.066\nI wanna make sure I see a green\ncheck mark over here for\n\n462\n00:26:21.066 --> 00:26:24.150\nthe rights management as well, okay?\n\n463\n00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:28.600\nNow if you do not have this you probably\nwon't see where it tells you about\n\n464\n00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.360\nthe Microsoft information protection.\n\n465\n00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.679\nIn other words you probably won't even\nsee that information right there.\n\n466\n00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:37.630\nBut overall though this is how you do it.\n\n467\n00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:42.630\nAnd if you choose to remove it as\nsimple as deactivating it as well.\n\n468\n00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:47.250\nSo this gives you then\nthose places inside of\n\n469\n00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.080\nthe Office products,\nwhere if you go into Outlook and\n\n470\n00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.980\nyou forward something out, it's gonna say,\nno, I don't want you to do that.\n\n471\n00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:59.603\nSo if you actually go in and set that for\nthose files, where they're not supposed to\n\n472\n00:26:59.603 --> 00:27:02.921\nbe outside the organization,\nthey won't be able to do so.\n\n473\n00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:04.150\nSo is a great thing here.\n\n474\n00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:08.680\nSo, the only other thing, I said\nenterprise only but I just looked down and\n\n475\n00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.420\nwanna make sure you can\nhave an academic version or\n\n476\n00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:16.160\nthe government types of, so\nthere's the e version, right.\n\n477\n00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.790\nThe enterprise version,\nthere's the academic versions, and\n\n478\n00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:21.220\nthere's the government types of versions.\n\n479\n00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:26.130\nThose are normally where you actually\nhave that ability to do what you want to\n\n480\n00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.365\ndo a for that part.\n\n481\n00:27:27.365 --> 00:27:32.885\nAnd if again your licence doesn't provide\nthat you even see the protection form,\n\n482\n00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:37.200\nso that's actually kind of neat\nwhen you do that too okay.\n\n483\n00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.983\nSo that is one part of the solution that\nyou have available to you is protection\n\n484\n00:27:41.983 --> 00:27:42.652\nthat way.\n\n485\n00:27:42.652 --> 00:27:46.766\nThe other part is fairly similar, but\nit gives you much more detail and\n\n486\n00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:48.940\ngranularity as well.\n\n487\n00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:54.065\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nwhere we begin to store the data,\n\n488\n00:27:54.065 --> 00:28:00.177\nor not the data, but to take a look\nat implementing data loss prevention,\n\n489\n00:28:00.177 --> 00:28:03.352\nwhich I apparently can't say today.\n\n490\n00:28:03.352 --> 00:28:05.210\nSo let's go ahead and do that as well.\n\n491\n00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.982\nI need to go back to the Office 365,\nAnd now, look at that,\n\n492\n00:28:09.982 --> 00:28:11.481\nit's changed up a little bit here.\n\n493\n00:28:13.146 --> 00:28:16.640\nLet's see if I can find,\nwhere's my Admin Portal.\n\n494\n00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.032\nWell that was unusual.\n\n495\n00:28:18.032 --> 00:28:20.249\nLet me just do it this way instead.\n\n496\n00:28:20.249 --> 00:28:22.813\nI don't like that view.\n\n497\n00:28:22.813 --> 00:28:23.950\nLet me close out of this.\n\n498\n00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:27.700\nAnd close out of that one, there we go.\n\n499\n00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.743\nLet's go back into Admin.\n\n500\n00:28:34.261 --> 00:28:36.594\nAnd if we need to do data loss prevention,\n\n501\n00:28:36.594 --> 00:28:41.110\nthis is where we're gonna scroll\ndown to the Admin center again.\n\n502\n00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.060\nSelect the final icon that's in that list.\n\n503\n00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:48.320\nInstead, and then we are going to look for\nsecurity and compliance.\n\n504\n00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.010\nAnd within security and\n\n505\n00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:56.900\ncompliance, you'll notice that there is a\nbig link over here on the left-hand side.\n\n506\n00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.360\nI'm kinda surprised this is\nactually hanging out for me.\n\n507\n00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.480\nCuz normally, once it actually\nfigures out my resolution,\n\n508\n00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.320\nit collapses everything down.\n\n509\n00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:08.025\nSo here in data loss prevention, you'll\nsee that there's three three things that\n\n510\n00:29:08.025 --> 00:29:11.935\nwe need to configure to begin to\nmake this work with my organization.\n\n511\n00:29:11.935 --> 00:29:17.590\nPolicy, permissions, and of course\nwith BYOD, even device management.\n\n512\n00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.792\nBut I can't really do that right now,\nbecause Daniel,\n\n513\n00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:22.779\nI think I've talked way too long.\n\n514\n00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:24.930\nAnd that means we need\nto do another part here.\n\n515\n00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's not a problem Ronnie.\n\n516\n00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.813\nWe can just continue on with this lovely\nlittle series that we've started on.\n\n517\n00:29:29.813 --> 00:29:31.770\nAnd create another episode for that.\n\n518\n00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.904\nSo hopefully we will see\nyou good folks there.\n\n519\n00:29:33.904 --> 00:29:37.510\nAs well as my good friend Ronnie here,\nand we'll be back for that.\n\n520\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.616\nSo definitely join us to see\nthe combination of how do we get data loss\n\n521\n00:29:40.616 --> 00:29:44.447\nprotection inside of Office 365 I know\nyou're riveted at the edge of your seat.\n\n522\n00:29:44.447 --> 00:29:46.117\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know I am.\n\n523\n00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:47.310\nSo definitely join us for that.\n\n524\n00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:50.810\nBut as for this episode we\nneed to go ahead and sign off.\n\n525\n00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.135\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n526\n00:29:53.135 --> 00:29:53.850\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n527\n00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.890\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n528\n00:29:55.890 -->

are watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:14.020\n&gt;&gt; All right Greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.210\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.580\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.690\nin today's episode we are back with\nmore on our Office 365 series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.748\nThat's right,\nwith the good old 73 47 series,\n\n9\n00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:28.910\nthat's what we've been\nembarking upon here.\n\n10\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.060\nAnd joining us in the studio, lending his\nmassive knowledge base on this very topic,\n\n11\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.290\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.640\nRonnie, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.800\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you again for\n\n14\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.110\nhaving me back on the show as\nwe continue on into a part five.\n\n15\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.130\nWe're getting close to the rocky range\nnow of series that we're having.\n\n16\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.280\nSo we're gonna continue on here,\n\n17\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.130\ntake a look at some of the different\ncollaboration solutions.\n\n18\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.650\nIn the previous episode, we got to this\npoint and I realized we were out of time.\n\n19\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.590\nSo now we're going to kind of back track\njust a little bit to talk about data\n\n20\n00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.040\nloss prevention, and\nhow we can set that up for Office 365 too.\n\n21\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.090\nRemember that for\nthe idea of data loss prevention,\n\n22\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.720\nwe are really trying to make sure that\nit's not only about losing files.\n\n23\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.660\nBut it's something that can\nexamine the contents of the files\n\n24\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.510\nto make sure that we don't\nallow that to get outside, and\n\n25\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.690\nin the hands of people that\nwe don't want to have happen.\n\n26\n00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.760\nSo we also then set a little bit of\nthe rights management information,\n\n27\n00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.800\nand the settings there to ensure\nthat we could control that.\n\n28\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.050\nAs well as now turning to\ntake a look at data loss\n\n29\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.610\nprevention policies that we have\nto actually take a look at, too.\n\n30\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.270\nSo the way that we do that is,\nlet's take a look at our computer and\n\n31\n00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.840\nthat will help us to get\non to the right place.\n\n32\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.510\nIn the last episode I showed you where you\ncould go to the admin tile and then inside\n\n33\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.660\nthe Office 365 admin you also look at\nlower left hand corner you can select\n\n34\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.560\nthe admin center there, and then you can\ngo in and select security and compliance.\n\n35\n00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.050\nThat is one of the ways that you can\ngo I want it cleaned up a little bit,\n\n36\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.260\ncuz it was getting a little bit,\nkind of busy.\n\n37\n00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.575\nYou can also select this\nown tile right here too.\n\n38\n00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:13.294\nEither way,\nbrings you to the same place, but\n\n39\n00:02:13.294 --> 00:02:18.271\nit's just kinda a reminder there's more\nthan one way to skin a cat in Office 365.\n\n40\n00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.870\nAnd this brings you into, well,\nthe Security and Compliance Center.\n\n41\n00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.475\nAnd when you take a look\nup here at the top,\n\n42\n00:02:26.475 --> 00:02:29.773\nI want you to kind of note the URL here.\n\n43\n00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:35.320\nOkay, protection.office.com,\nthis also gives you something\n\n44\n00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.820\nthat I hope will help you out\nin the future if you choose to.\n\n45\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.570\nEven if you don't need to always\nlog in to the Office Admin Center\n\n46\n00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.840\nitself in portal.office.com, if you wanted\nto go directly to the compliance center,\n\n47\n00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.040\nyou can always type in\nprotection.office.com, and\n\n48\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.070\nthat will bring you\ndirectly to this page too.\n\n49\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.060\nYou'll still have to log in,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n50\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.580\nBut at the same time, You can go directly\nhere if you choose to take a look.\n\n51\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.040\nOnce we're inside the security and\n\n52\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.950\ncompliance admin portal, that is when we\nscroll down on the left hand side and\n\n53\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.720\nnow you can see the link here for\ndata loss prevention.\n\n54\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.800\nOnce I select data loss prevention,\n\n55\n00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.160\nnotice that it gives me three of these\noptions and there's really the first two\n\n56\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.060\nthat we're gonna take a look\nat as far as setting up here.\n\n57\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.650\nThe device management portion\nof it essentially goes into\n\n58\n00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.810\nWindows Intune and of course SharePoint\nas well to get get everything set up for\n\n59\n00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.590\nthe bring your own device,\nmaking sure that we have this.\n\n60\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.406\nBut I want you to take a look at\nthe policy settings that are available,\n\n61\n00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:46.420\nand this is how you begin to set it up.\n\n62\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.130\nAll I have to do is click on policy,\nand once I have policy opened up.\n\n63\n00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.420\nThis is now where you can begin to\nsee the home of data loss prevention.\n\n64\n00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.980\nUse data loss prevention\npolicies to help identify and\n\n65\n00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.760\nprotect the organization's\nsensitive information.\n\n66\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.150\nFor example, you can setup policies\nto make sure information in email and\n\n67\n00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.994\ndocs isn't shared with the wrong people.\n\n68\n00:04:11.994 --> 00:04:16.060\nSo that's sounds like a math for\nyou, you are in the proper place.\n\n69\n00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.000\nYou can also see a little\nbit of a chart here,\n\n70\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.890\nwhere they're showing you what actually\nmatches any policies at all right now.\n\n71\n00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.260\nBecause that's how it actually knows to\nblock it, but we're doing pretty good\n\n72\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.830\nsince we don't have anything that\nmatches our data loss prevention policy.\n\n73\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.840\nIt probably means we're okay.\n\n74\n00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.580\nThe other thing about the data loss\nprevention is notice that right away,\n\n75\n00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.910\nthey also show this idea of\nfalse positives and overrides.\n\n76\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.850\nThis lets you know something\nelse that can go on, too.\n\n77\n00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.090\nYou can set it up, and\nI'll show you where you can do this.\n\n78\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.730\nWhere somebody takes a look at that data\nloss prevention policy that's there.\n\n79\n00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.380\nThey're given a notification that says,\n\n80\n00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.300\nhey, data loss prevention is\nstopping you from doing this.\n\n81\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.600\nBut you can override it if you choose.\n\n82\n00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.280\nSo it can give you that,\n\n83\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.150\nit may not be something an option\nthat you choose to use.\n\n84\n00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.660\nBut it might be an option that you have\nto use, especially if it's the owner of\n\n85\n00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.670\nthe company that says, I wanna share\nthis with whoever I want to share this.\n\n86\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.318\nI shouldn't be blocked by the policy.\n\n87\n00:05:10.318 --> 00:05:13.379\nSo if they're the ones saying it, you kind\nof got to do what they want you to do.\n\n88\n00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.733\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a little difficult to argue with\n\n89\n00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:18.487\nthe man that signs or\nwomen that signs checks, right?\n\n90\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.680\nThey are giving you your money,\nyou are probably gonna do what they say.\n\n91\n00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.810\n&gt;&gt; And it makes sense.\n\n92\n00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.580\nSometimes it might just be where it is\non a case by case basis where you go,\n\n93\n00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.218\nwe really wanna make sure that\npeople don't do this accidentally.\n\n94\n00:05:32.218 --> 00:05:36.420\nBut there maybe a reason why some of\nthis information is being shared out.\n\n95\n00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.170\nBut that will go through the security\npolicy for your organization.\n\n96\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.990\nSo that's not really about what we're\ndoing, which is setting policy.\n\n97\n00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.190\nSomebody else sets the policy and\n\n98\n00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.810\nall we have to do is go, I need to\nimplement the policy that's there.\n\n99\n00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.230\nSo it is something that we have to\nbe aware of, but if you do see that,\n\n100\n00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.450\nthose will show up on our screen too.\n\n101\n00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.440\nBut the great thing is,\n\n102\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.130\nit's not really a lot of different\nsettings available right away.\n\n103\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.130\nLet's take a look at the screen.\n\n104\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.750\nYou'll notice that when it comes down to\nit, if we don't have any policies set\n\n105\n00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.040\nthere's only one thing that we can\ndo which is to create a policy.\n\n106\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.020\nSo it's not like six different\nbuttons that we have to worry about.\n\n107\n00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.420\nIt is one, and\nwe simply select the create policy, and\n\n108\n00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.310\nnow this is where it gets a little\nbit more detailed and complex.\n\n109\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.750\nBut remember that that means that\nthere's planning that has to be done\n\n110\n00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.080\nbefore you set this up.\n\n111\n00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.800\nAnd this is when you do go to\nyour compliance officers, or\n\n112\n00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.150\nthe people in charge of compliance,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n113\n00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.350\nAnd it's something that we're\nvery scared of in today's world.\n\n114\n00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.780\nEspecially on the data losses and\n\n115\n00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.790\nthe breaches that have happened\nover the past few years.\n\n116\n00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.340\nEvery company, especially big companies,\ncompliance is kind of the key for\n\n117\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.680\neverything that they do.\n\n118\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.260\nAnd this is essentially a utility that\nhelps to maintain that compliance.\n\n119\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.720\nSo once you have the policy in hand,\nthat's when you can come in and now create\n\n120\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.120\nyour policies that can be implemented\nto enforce the policy that was created.\n\n121\n00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.330\nThe great thing is,\n\n122\n00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.520\nit shows us step by step on what we're\ngoing to do over on the left hand side.\n\n123\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.630\nWe're first, of course, going to\nchoose what information to protect.\n\n124\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.760\nWe're going to name our policy,\nwhere it's going to apply.\n\n125\n00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.170\nAnd the settings that are here.\n\n126\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.560\nAnd then we're going to review\nit before we implement anything.\n\n127\n00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.410\nSo at this point, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the steps here as we create\n\n128\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.410\na policy, so\nthat you can see what is available to you.\n\n129\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.510\nNotice it says,\nthat you can choose an industry regulation\n\n130\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.090\nto see the data loss policy templates\nthat you can use to protect, or\n\n131\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.100\ncreate your own custom one from scratch.\n\n132\n00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.613\nNow I recommend that you\nstart with a template, and\n\n133\n00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:40.831\nthen modify from the template.\n\n134\n00:07:40.831 --> 00:07:45.458\nYou can start from a custom,\n100% your own thing, but\n\n135\n00:07:45.458 --> 00:07:52.649\nthat's It's almost like trying to reinvent\nthe wheel when Microsoft and Office 365.\n\n136\n00:07:52.649 --> 00:07:56.396\nThey've gone ahead and they've tried to\nlook for the information that most of\n\n137\n00:07:56.396 --> 00:07:59.420\nthe time people find to be that\nsensitive type of information.\n\n138\n00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.350\nSo you're wondering,\nwhat are you talking about, Ronnie?\n\n139\n00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.599\nWhat is sensitive information?\n\n140\n00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:06.240\nWell, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at some of that.\n\n141\n00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.745\nNotice they give us a major category.\n\n142\n00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:12.340\nFinancial information, Medical and health,\n\n143\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.270\nPrivacy, those are kind of the three big\nones here that we have to worry about.\n\n144\n00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.100\nLet's select Financial,\njust as an example.\n\n145\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.140\nDepending on where you are in the world,\nthat may be different.\n\n146\n00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.430\nNotice that we have\nan Australian Financial Data.\n\n147\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:29.340\nAnd let's just select that one just as\nan example, and then I'll scroll out and\n\n148\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.900\nscroll over here just a little bit so\nthat we can see what we're talking about.\n\n149\n00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.870\nAnd now as I scroll in,\nnotice that for the Australia one,\n\n150\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.610\nhelps detect the presence of\ninformation commonly considered\n\n151\n00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:47.340\nto be financial data in Australia\nincluding credit cards and SWIFT codes.\n\n152\n00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.850\nAnd it tells you the actual categories\nof what they're actually protecting, so\n\n153\n00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.810\nthis is really good.\n\n154\n00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.860\nWhat if I'm here in the United States and\n\n155\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:01.260\nI'm actually in charge of setting this but\nI have a branch office in Australia.\n\n156\n00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.900\nIt wouldn't be great for\nme to set it for Germany.\n\n157\n00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.390\nBut I can actually set it and\n\n158\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.070\nnotice that these are actually by\ncountry which is very good for us.\n\n159\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.241\nBut let's say for\n\n160\n00:09:11.241 --> 00:09:16.471\nexample that we know that our company is\nsupposed to follow the PCI DSS, right,\n\n161\n00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:21.952\nthat payment card industry data security\nstandard that is available out here too.\n\n162\n00:09:21.952 --> 00:09:26.617\nHelps detect the presence of information\nsubject to the PCI Data Security Standard,\n\n163\n00:09:26.617 --> 00:09:30.116\nincluding information like credit card and\ndebit numbers, and\n\n164\n00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:33.970\nit shows you what those numbers\nare protecting as well.\n\n165\n00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.890\nAnd as we scroll down,\nyou can see a few of them.\n\n166\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.010\nSo as I scroll through here,\nyou actually notice it's not only based on\n\n167\n00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.540\ncountry because that's the way laws\nare and regulations normally are,\n\n168\n00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.160\nespecially on financial data.\n\n169\n00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.060\nHere is the US financial\ndata where we are located\n\n170\n00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.929\nright here in\nthe United States in Florida.\n\n171\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.940\nCredit card numbers,\nUS bank account numbers, the ABA,\n\n172\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.690\nAmerican Business Association routing\nnumbers, that are also there.\n\n173\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.784\nIf you're doing trade,\nright, stock market stuff,\n\n174\n00:10:03.784 --> 00:10:08.480\nnotice they have that,\nUS Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n\n175\n00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.070\nSo they even have some of the more\ncommon and up to date ones.\n\n176\n00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.080\nThis one, of course,\nincludes in your federal ID\n\n177\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.650\nnumber as well as your social security\nnumber to get everything in there.\n\n178\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.980\nSo all of this information\nis a nice little template,\n\n179\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:28.970\nat least at the beginning, that you and\nI can use to set some financial data\n\n180\n00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:33.300\nif we want to, and see what we want to\nblock from ever getting out of my company.\n\n181\n00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.730\nIf I'm in the healthcare industry or\nin the fields that support that,\n\n182\n00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.980\nnotice once again we have different acts\nthat are available all around the country.\n\n183\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.350\nAnd here in the US it would\nbe well the HIPA, right?\n\n184\n00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:51.180\nThe very fact that we have all of this\ninformation, the health insurance act and\n\n185\n00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.970\nthis actually is the US Social Security\nnumber, as well as the drug enforcement\n\n186\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:01.030\nagency number as part of HIPAA,\nthat we don't divulge out as well.\n\n187\n00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.190\nWe, of course, have different privacy\nstandards, and this all goes for\n\n188\n00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.770\nthat personally identifiable information.\n\n189\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.630\nEach one by the actual country here.\n\n190\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.880\nAnd the one that's kind of, look at that,\nthe US Patriot Act is also in here.\n\n191\n00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.500\nWhat are we actually\nprotecting from this one?\n\n192\n00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.653\nNotice it's kinda the same thing that\nwe saw in that Gramm-Leach-Bliley\n\n193\n00:11:22.653 --> 00:11:27.165\nexcept that it also includes\ncredit card information, I think.\n\n194\n00:11:27.165 --> 00:11:31.360\nSo you see that and then here's\na personally identifiable information.\n\n195\n00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:37.620\nOnce again, not exactly beyond our notion\nof understanding what's being protected.\n\n196\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.580\nBut you can see where you can at\nleast start off with a general idea,\n\n197\n00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.040\nand a general notion of\nwhat can be covered.\n\n198\n00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.960\nSo that when we set up a policy, we're at\nleast protecting that bit of information\n\n199\n00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.920\nwithout us having to create it all.\n\n200\n00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.420\nIf I start off from custom, remember,\n\n201\n00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.820\nit means I now am actually\ngonna create it from scratch.\n\n202\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.570\nAnd that can be a lot more\nchallenging than you'd think,\n\n203\n00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.970\nbecause most of us don't know what\nexactly needs to be protected.\n\n204\n00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:11.020\nBut in an industry in which is regulated,\nyou definitely will actually\n\n205\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.710\nhave some guideline and they tell you in\nthat guideline that this company has to\n\n206\n00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:23.600\nsupport the PCI data security standard,\nwell you simply select that one.\n\n207\n00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.950\nAnd once you select that one,\n\n208\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.140\nit doesn't allow you to actually select\nmultiple ones right here, right?\n\n209\n00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.400\nSo you'd actually create one for\nyour financial, you'd create one for\n\n210\n00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.350\nyour medical, your privacy standards.\n\n211\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.590\nYou click Next, and\nnow it gives you a name, and\n\n212\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.960\nyou can then have your name here.\n\n213\n00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:45.027\nAnd type into the description,\nthis is our,\n\n214\n00:12:48.658 --> 00:12:55.498\nPCI Security Standard, Security policy.\n\n215\n00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:03.790\nAll right, select Next, notice it\ngives us locations to protect too.\n\n216\n00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.730\nLocations all in Office 365 include\nExchange, email, OneDrive and SharePoint.\n\n217\n00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.152\nSo do we want this to actually be\nprotecting across all of those?\n\n218\n00:13:14.152 --> 00:13:18.102\nOr if I select choose specific\nlocation and I click Next,\n\n219\n00:13:18.102 --> 00:13:22.214\nnotice I can toggle them on or\noff on what I want to protect and\n\n220\n00:13:22.214 --> 00:13:25.890\nwhat I really don't want\nto protect as well.\n\n221\n00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:30.180\nSo you do have choices when\nyou start to do this and\n\n222\n00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.435\neven inside of SharePoint,\nit gets even more granular.\n\n223\n00:13:33.435 --> 00:13:36.440\nWhere you can choose certain\nparticular collection sites\n\n224\n00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.380\nas well as accounts if you want\nto under OneDrive for Business.\n\n225\n00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.360\nLet me click back there, and\nlet me select all the locations.\n\n226\n00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.130\nThen click Next again.\n\n227\n00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.805\nAnd now here is where\nyou are helping out or\n\n228\n00:13:50.805 --> 00:13:55.240\nyou're kind of told what's going\nto be done at some point too.\n\n229\n00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.180\nNotice that we have these simple settings\nwhich has fine content containing this\n\n230\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.070\ntype of information.\n\n231\n00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.814\nThen you can select credit card.\n\n232\n00:14:06.756 --> 00:14:11.060\nAnd any other types of classifications and\nthe match accuracy.\n\n233\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.010\nThis says minimum and maximum of a 100.\n\n234\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:19.360\nMinimum 85% or 85 of them when content\ncontains sensitive information.\n\n235\n00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.730\nSo you can set that up if you want to,\nI'm not gonna worry about that right now.\n\n236\n00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.161\nLet me cancel that one.\n\n237\n00:14:25.161 --> 00:14:29.458\nThe other one, of course,\nis detect when the content is shared and\n\n238\n00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:33.195\nthose are pretty simple settings, right?\n\n239\n00:14:33.195 --> 00:14:36.350\nLet's say that we don't worry\nabout the credit card information\n\n240\n00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.580\nfloating around inside\nof our organization.\n\n241\n00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.300\nBut we do worry about it when\nit actually gets to outside.\n\n242\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.560\nNotice I can, of course,\n\n243\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.120\nalso detect only when people\ninside my organization get it too.\n\n244\n00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.270\nAnd, of course,\nthere are advanced settings.\n\n245\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.960\nThat now allow you to setup low volume and\n\n246\n00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.710\nhigh volume content of that information\nthat needs to be protected too.\n\n247\n00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.540\nSo it just depends on the amount of\ninformation that you're really trying to\n\n248\n00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.960\nprotect as well.\n\n249\n00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.680\nSo it gives you all of those advances,\nand then this last one here.\n\n250\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.210\nThis is the one that we also\nwanted to make sure that we do.\n\n251\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:15.400\nWhat do you want to do if we detect\nthat sensitive information, okay?\n\n252\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.900\nSo we will automatically create\na detailed activity report so\n\n253\n00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.550\nthat you can see that and\nthen what else do you want to do.\n\n254\n00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.230\nNotify users when content\nmatches this policy.\n\n255\n00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.950\nShow policy tips, and that's a good\none because that means it kind of\n\n256\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.190\nhovers over there and says, hey,\nhere's what's going to happen.\n\n257\n00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.200\nSo just like the apps, when you see that.\n\n258\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.740\nWhen you hover over something,\nand it gives you a tool tip,\n\n259\n00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.000\nhere is a policy tip that will also\ngive you that ability to do this too.\n\n260\n00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.630\nYou can customize that tip, if you want\nto, to make it specific to your company.\n\n261\n00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.825\nYou can say, ITProTV doesn't allow for\nthis type of information,\n\n262\n00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:55.548\ninstead of the generic, this is not\nallowed, whatever it might be, okay?\n\n263\n00:15:55.548 --> 00:16:02.390\nNow, the other one Detect when a specific\namount of sensitive data is being shared.\n\n264\n00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.680\nSo you can limit it all\nthe way down to say, look.\n\n265\n00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.380\nTen instances in the same sensitive type,\nor one.\n\n266\n00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.850\nRemember, the lower that this number is,\nthe more increase that it's going to take.\n\n267\n00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.560\nAs far as,\nthe resource we don't worry about so much,\n\n268\n00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.020\nbecause it's cloud solution.\n\n269\n00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.400\nBut it does actually take up a lot\nof resources when you do this.\n\n270\n00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.300\nWhen you start seeing it too.\n\n271\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.040\nIncident email report, of course, and\n\n272\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:33.060\nchoose what to include in the report and\nwho receives it.\n\n273\n00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.200\nBlock people from sharing and restrict it.\n\n274\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.750\nThat's probably the big one that\nyou wanna make sure of, right?\n\n275\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.690\nYou don't want them to share\nthat information, you block it.\n\n276\n00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:50.870\nBut then, notice that this check mark does\nnot appear until you actually choose that.\n\n277\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.960\nSo, if you don't have it chosen,\nnotice it's gone.\n\n278\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.620\nThen if you do,\nthis is where you will allow for\n\n279\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.130\nthat tip override if you want to.\n\n280\n00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.890\nSo, if you want to do that,\nthen that's what you end up doing.\n\n281\n00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.210\nIt may be like we said, maybe it's the\npresident of the company that says, no,\n\n282\n00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.570\nI'm allowed to share this information.\n\n283\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.760\nNobody else may be able to, but he wants\nthat ability if the policy comes up,\n\n284\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.720\nto override that then we're off and\nready to go.\n\n285\n00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.280\nBut it does show you that\ninformation right there.\n\n286\n00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.880\nAnd this is kind of the very basics\nof what we want to get through and\n\n287\n00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.510\nunderstand as we set up the data\nloss prevention policies too.\n\n288\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.180\nAnd of course before you\nimplement it company wide,\n\n289\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.240\nhere's a setting that I used a little bit\nearlier before you put it out there, okay?\n\n290\n00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.190\nThis might be the setting to use.\n\n291\n00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.880\nLet me test this out first.\n\n292\n00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.670\nYou get some data.\n\n293\n00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.650\nAnd you see if it's actually\ngoing to work that way.\n\n294\n00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.820\nYou can turn it on right away which\naffects the entire organization, or\n\n295\n00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.140\nyou can choose when you're gonna\nturn it on a little bit later.\n\n296\n00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.820\nSo this gives you some time.\n\n297\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.350\nMake sure you review\nthe policy with security,\n\n298\n00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.970\nmake sure everything else is\nactually doing what we want to.\n\n299\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.470\nAnd that way you'll get the entire\npolicy ready to go when you're ready.\n\n300\n00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.970\nOkay?\n\n301\n00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.226\nFinally, in the end of course,\n\n302\n00:18:06.226 --> 00:18:10.050\nit gives you the ability now to\nmodify a little bit of the settings.\n\n303\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:14.990\nAs you go through, you can see\nwhat's actually going to apply and\n\n304\n00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.830\nwhat isn't, and\nwhether you wanna turn it on or not.\n\n305\n00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.868\nWell, once everything is setup the way\nthat you want to for right now,\n\n306\n00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:22.371\nyou can simply create the policy.\n\n307\n00:18:25.752 --> 00:18:30.306\nAnd hopefully, once the policy's created,\nthen you can go back in and test it and\n\n308\n00:18:30.306 --> 00:18:34.050\nverify everything is working\nthe way that you want to.\n\n309\n00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.930\nChange it if you need to.\n\n310\n00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.700\nTest it again,\nmake sure everything else is here.\n\n311\n00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.260\nAnd now notice there is the policy\nready to go, and we can all.\n\n312\n00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.230\nLet me close this out for a moment.\n\n313\n00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.890\nYou'll also see of course the names\nof the policy listed right here.\n\n314\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:53.870\nRemember it doesn't allow you to\nkind of merge together your privacy,\n\n315\n00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.420\nyour health information.\n\n316\n00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.600\nAnd of course the financial industry,\nif you're gonna do this as far as the data\n\n317\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.180\ngoes, you probably need to create\nseparate policies for each one of those.\n\n318\n00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.260\nAnd that will then combine and\ngive you what you need to overall for\n\n319\n00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.080\neveryone in your organization.\n\n320\n00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.870\nBut this is a very effective way then\n\n321\n00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:15.400\nto manage data loss prevention especially\nin a cloud based organization.\n\n322\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.040\nWhich you're probably going to if\nyou're interested in watching this show\n\n323\n00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.410\nis because everybody is moving towards it.\n\n324\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.060\nAnd you're the one that is\nactually right there saying,\n\n325\n00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.150\nyeah I got to learn this stuff.\n\n326\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.000\nWell if you're gonna do this that\nmeans you have to figure out a way to\n\n327\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.680\nprotect this data wherever it\nactually resides in the cloud.\n\n328\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.350\nAnd even if you're the end users, right?\n\n329\n00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.360\nAre working with Office\n2016 on the computers,\n\n330\n00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.790\nhow are you protecting the data\nthat the download from there.\n\n331\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.030\nAgain these are the methods that\nyou'd normally use to do that.\n\n332\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.480\nVery effective, works very well,\nis something that you need to make sure\n\n333\n00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.312\nthat you have a good grasp of before\nyou go on into the exams as well.\n\n334\n00:19:52.312 --> 00:19:54.790\n&gt;&gt; All right, it seems like Microsoft has\ndone everything they can to take a lot of\n\n335\n00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.180\nheavy lifting out of us.\n\n336\n00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.740\nCreating these types of policies,\n\n337\n00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.120\nespecially when you're\nin a regulated industry.\n\n338\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.060\nSomething like medical field or\nfinancial institutions.\n\n339\n00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.190\nNow if we create a policy and\nwe need to go back later and edit it,\n\n340\n00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.480\ndo we have that option as well?\n\n341\n00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.230\n&gt;&gt; You definitely do.\n\n342\n00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:13.450\nIn the same location all you do is you\nwould select the policy itself and\n\n343\n00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.960\nthen you just simply find\nthe information here.\n\n344\n00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.140\nAnd once you do so, notice you can go and\nthen Edit the policy directly here.\n\n345\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.420\nSo it gives you that right away.\n\n346\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.200\nNow, I told you, and\n\n347\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.350\nI kinda forgot about this because\nthe policies were so interesting.\n\n348\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.370\nBut notice these other two options\nwhich I don't mean to leave out.\n\n349\n00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.450\nWe're just gonna take\na look at them briefly.\n\n350\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.390\nThere's not a lot of configurations\nwe're going to do here.\n\n351\n00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.900\nBut let me select the app\npermissions here just for a moment.\n\n352\n00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.210\nAnd this is where you have to pay\nattention to your subscription\n\n353\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.940\non Office 365 of how this is gonna work.\n\n354\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.340\nIt says it allows you to use\nadvanced security management okay.\n\n355\n00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.160\nTo take advantage of these\nfeatures such as alerts,\n\n356\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:00.220\nproductivity application discovery,\nas well as app permissions as well.\n\n357\n00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:05.290\nSo, if you go, that's not granular enough,\nit gives you the ability to go deeper, and\n\n358\n00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:10.650\nto make it much more cookie cutter\nshaped the way that you want to.\n\n359\n00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.050\nTo give you more and\nmore access and control into that.\n\n360\n00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:14.990\nSo you can do that.\n\n361\n00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.900\nWe're not really getting into that for\nright now because\n\n362\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.620\nthat gets into just creating more and\nmore policies and you can do that as well.\n\n363\n00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.930\nBut the device management,\n\n364\n00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:28.030\nas I select that you'll see where it\nturns into Intune up here very quickly.\n\n365\n00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.560\nAnd now notice we have switched over into\nIntune, and the nice thing about most of\n\n366\n00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.920\nthe Intune stuff today you follow their\nwizard and you set it up, is what you do.\n\n367\n00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.620\nSo you don't really have to do a lot, and\n\n368\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.300\nwe're not going to take the time\nto really get into this.\n\n369\n00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.520\nBecause this goes into another portion of\nsomething else that you saw in the 346,\n\n370\n00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.880\nwhen we talked about\nmobile management as well.\n\n371\n00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.540\nBut it's essentially the same things.\n\n372\n00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.210\nYou apply those settings and\nrestrictions, you control the access and\n\n373\n00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.410\nthen you have that ability to\nwipe the data as it goes on.\n\n374\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.270\nAnd that's a big part of it right?\n\n375\n00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.330\nIs making sure that if somebody ends\nup stealing my phone that you can go on\n\n376\n00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.770\nthe internet and zap the information and\n\n377\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:11.570\nwe're done and that's what really helps\nus out when we start doing that as well.\n\n378\n00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.590\nSo just kinda realize that you do have\nprotection regardless of where the data\n\n379\n00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:20.580\nresides and of being all set these\npolicies up and change them and\n\n380\n00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.930\nconfigure them to meet\nthe needs of your organization.\n\n381\n00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.360\nVery powerful tool,\n\n382\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.960\nsomething we should not neglect especially\nwe're handling healthcare information,\n\n383\n00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.020\ncredit card information Personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n384\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.570\nAll that's gonna be right there and\n\n385\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:40.120\nit's something that we definitely\nneed to consider at all points.\n\n386\n00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.950\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff Ronnie.\n\n387\n00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:45.030\nWe do thank you for showing us how we\ncan actually do that and not have to\n\n388\n00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.350\nkick our clumsy little feet around\ntil we figure out what we have to do.\n\n389\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.100\nKind of been a great guide to\nsee where we need to go and\n\n390\n00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.610\nsome of the obstacles we may encounter and\nhow to overcome them.\n\n391\n00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.950\nPick the right choices as\nwe create our policies.\n\n392\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.420\nRonnie, thanks so much for\njoining us today,\n\n393\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.170\nwe appreciate your knowledge on this.\n\n394\n00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.000\nWe do appreciate our viewers watching as\nwell but it looks like it's that time for\n\n395\n00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.280\nus to sign off.\n\n396\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.490\nFor ITProTV I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n397\n00:23:07.490 -->

00:00:08.441\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:12.239\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:17.070\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone, welcome\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.860\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.517\nin today's episode we are coming back\nat you with more on our 70-347 series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:27.648\nThe old Microsoft Office 365, and\njoining us in the studio yet again,\n\n9\n00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:29.730\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.290\nRonnie, glad to have you back, man.\n\n11\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.980\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.168\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, thank you, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:38.514\nGlad to be back as we take a look\nnow at a neat process that we call,\n\n14\n00:00:38.514 --> 00:00:41.090\nof course, eDiscovery here.\n\n15\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.640\nAnd our goal, of course,\n\n16\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.440\nis not only to explain to you what\neDiscovery is, but also configure it too.\n\n17\n00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.877\n&gt;&gt; That's a channel on cable right,\nthat's the old eDiscovery.\n\n18\n00:00:49.877 --> 00:00:51.415\n&gt;&gt; I think it may be that's right.\n\n19\n00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:55.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now that I think about it yeah it's\n\n20\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.893\nclose but\neDiscovery is a very neat feature and\n\n21\n00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:02.460\nside of the Office 365\ntenant that we have.\n\n22\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.490\nAnd it's also something that for those of\nyou that have worked with Exchange for\n\n23\n00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.520\na long time.\n\n24\n00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.581\nYou've also done some\nof the stuff here too.\n\n25\n00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:15.733\neDiscovery is essentially an enterprise\nfeature that allows us first and\n\n26\n00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:21.370\nforemost to be able to identify certain\ntypes of information that we want.\n\n27\n00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.370\nAnd of course to be able\nto get that information.\n\n28\n00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.596\nIn other words deliver the information\nIn a way that is going to be, well,\n\n29\n00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:32.370\nthat needs to be presented,\nlet's say, legally.\n\n30\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.370\nSo if there's a court case that\ncomes up and we need certain data,\n\n31\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.700\nwe might actually use eDiscovery to\nhelp us out, especially in a legal case.\n\n32\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.540\nNow, this brings up the notion\nthat the idea here of well,\n\n33\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.810\nthat should be simple enough.\n\n34\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.337\nWhy don't we just use the search\nfeatures that are available to\n\n35\n00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:51.632\nus inside of our Office client?\n\n36\n00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:55.531\nThat should find every piece of\nemail that we have ready to go.\n\n37\n00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:58.420\nAnd you might think, yeah, why not?\n\n38\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.609\nWhy is eDiscovery so important?\n\n39\n00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.620\neDiscovery works in this way instead,\n\n40\n00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.540\nwhere we're not only looking at\nan isolated inbox, or a mailbox, per se.\n\n41\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.593\nBut we're looking across\nthe entire organization.\n\n42\n00:02:11.593 --> 00:02:15.740\nSo even though i have permission\nto view my own inbox and\n\n43\n00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.890\nmy own mailbox, I dont have\npermission to view Daniel's mailbox.\n\n44\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.350\nI don't have the permission\nto view one of my\n\n45\n00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.400\nother peers mailbox and\ngather the information if that happens.\n\n46\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.500\nSometimes what ends up happening of course\nin the legal case, it might be where what\n\n47\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.250\nis request of them is that we need\nevery single email in the organization\n\n48\n00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.720\nthat involves these specific words okay.\n\n49\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.365\nThis particular criteria that we have.\n\n50\n00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:51.981\nAnd that's not only stuff that was sent\ndirectly to me, but it might be even\n\n51\n00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:57.040\nperipheral emails between Daniel and\nsomebody else, between two other people,\n\n52\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.980\nbut it went through our Exchange Server\nand it went through that process.\n\n53\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.860\nWell, eDiscovery can help us to look\nacross the entire tenancy at that point,\n\n54\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.930\nand look for\ncontents within the Exchange mailboxes,\n\n55\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.140\nwithin Office 365 groups, Microsoft teams,\n\n56\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.850\nSharePoint Online sites, and\neven Skype for Business Communications.\n\n57\n00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.750\nSo, even the instant messaging process\nthere, it can go through and look for\n\n58\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.350\nthose same words and\nthat same criteria, if we want to.\n\n59\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.020\nTo allow them to be able to gather all\nthat information as far as communication\n\n60\n00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.160\ngoes, regardless of who sent it,\nto do something like this.\n\n61\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.890\nAnd that's a big part of why\neDiscovery is an important concept\n\n62\n00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.060\nthat we may have to get involved in.\n\n63\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.700\nWe'd love to be able to say there's\nnever gonna be a need of that,\n\n64\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.950\nbecause our organization,\nwe're never gonna have issues like that.\n\n65\n00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.015\nBut people can sue,\nit is a litigious type of society.\n\n66\n00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:53.853\nAnd they can say no, I believe that inside\nthe organization there are emails that\n\n67\n00:03:53.853 --> 00:03:57.692\nrelate to something, and all of a sudden\nyou are pulled into this, and you do have\n\n68\n00:03:57.692 --> 00:04:01.670\nto produce those records, eDiscovery\nis what's gonna help us to do that.\n\n69\n00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.760\nSo a very neat process, in what's done.\n\n70\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.380\nIt does take a little bit of setup,\nI'm not gonna lie to you about that,\n\n71\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.200\nit's It's not like just a lot\nof things in Office 365.\n\n72\n00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.115\nClick, you just move the toggle button and\nit's off and you're ready to go.\n\n73\n00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:18.430\nThis requires a bit more setup to do.\n\n74\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.450\nAnd we're gonna take you\nthrough that process as well.\n\n75\n00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.114\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie actually answered\na question I was gonna ask which is do we\n\n76\n00:04:24.114 --> 00:04:27.922\nhave to set this up or is it just\ninherent to the nature of Office 365.\n\n77\n00:04:27.922 --> 00:04:31.405\nObviously, there's a little bit of\npointing, and clicking, and pressing, and\n\n78\n00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:32.461\nticking going on there.\n\n79\n00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:36.369\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit is something that once it gets set up,\n\n80\n00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:40.690\nthe hard thing is when you\nget that request, right?\n\n81\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.570\nAnd to actually be able to pull in\nthe information that they need, and\n\n82\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.430\nthen, of course,\nturn it over when it's needed, as well.\n\n83\n00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.293\nSo there is a bit of time involvement in\nit, there's also a bit of technicality\n\n84\n00:04:52.293 --> 00:04:56.099\nthat's involved, when you start talking\nabout complying with a subpoena or\n\n85\n00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.224\nsomething else that comes across\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n86\n00:04:59.224 --> 00:05:04.769\nBut the setup in itself, some of it is\nrelatively straight forward to do and\n\n87\n00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:09.470\nsome of it really isn't\nthat straightforward to do.\n\n88\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.249\nOne of the requirements though,\nwhen we start to do this,\n\n89\n00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.708\nis that we have to realize, especially\non the way that it called us out for\n\n90\n00:05:15.708 --> 00:05:18.059\nthe exam,\nis that you have to know it in two ways.\n\n91\n00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:23.220\nAnd that means, it's gonna require\na lot more time and effort for us.\n\n92\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.490\nAnd that requires you knowing how\nto do some of this in the GUI,\n\n93\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.100\ninside of the web UI, As well as,\nof course, inside of PowerShell.\n\n94\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.010\nSo there is no getting\naway from either one.\n\n95\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.536\nYou can't just abandon one for\nthe other, so\n\n96\n00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:41.143\nit does require you to\nat least know them both.\n\n97\n00:05:41.143 --> 00:05:43.909\nThe good thing is, on the web UI portion,\n\n98\n00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:49.490\nit's relatively intuitive in how you\ncan figure the majority of this out.\n\n99\n00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.950\nBut on the SharePoint portion though,\nis not as intuitive to\n\n100\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.280\nfigure everything out that you need to to\nget everything processed in the way and\n\n101\n00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.420\nto get handled and set up for\neDiscovery to begin to happen.\n\n102\n00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.540\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at what\nwe can normally in depth doing when we\n\n103\n00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.834\nstart talking about the idea of trying\nto just search out information, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:17.861\nIf the only thing I really need to\nsearch out are mailboxes, well I can\n\n105\n00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:23.420\ngo into the Exchange Admin Center,\nthe EAC, to help me out to do that.\n\n106\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.100\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nwhere we can find that information.\n\n107\n00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.031\nOn my screen, if I select Admin tab, and\n\n108\n00:06:30.031 --> 00:06:34.861\nonce I get into the Admin tab I'm\ngonna look for the same icon over on\n\n109\n00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:39.796\nthe left hand side of the screen\nwhich is gonna be at the very bottom.\n\n110\n00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:43.660\nAnd it's tiny cuz it's\nkinda hidden down here.\n\n111\n00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.220\nI'm going to select Exchange.\n\n112\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.040\nThis should bring me to the EAC,\nthe Exchange Admin Center.\n\n113\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.951\nInside of the exchange admin center\nif all I'm doing is searching in\n\n114\n00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:59.606\nin boxes themselves all I really\nneed is well this link right here\n\n115\n00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:03.506\nwhere actually says in-place\neDiscovery and hold.\n\n116\n00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:07.859\nI'm gonna click on this and will see\na weird message that pops up in yellow and\n\n117\n00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:12.350\nthis something else that you might\nneed to get ready for the exam too.\n\n118\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.850\nSo this appeared not too long ago, but\n\n119\n00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.690\nit is something that you should\npay attention to as well.\n\n120\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.235\nIf I'm just looking in inboxes,\nthis is the perfect place to go,\n\n121\n00:07:21.235 --> 00:07:23.947\nwhich is the in-place eDiscovery and\nhold here.\n\n122\n00:07:23.947 --> 00:07:29.410\nSearches mailboxes in your organization\nfor email and other messages.\n\n123\n00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.160\nThat contains specific keywords or\n\n124\n00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.050\nmeet other search criteria, you can\ncreate a new search, edit, or restart\n\n125\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.680\nan existing one to update your search\njust go ahead and click refresh below.\n\n126\n00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.100\nSo once you set that up,\nyou are ready to go.\n\n127\n00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.589\nBut now notice they're changing\nthis as of July, 1st 2017 and\n\n128\n00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:55.151\nthat's still ahead of the recording time\nthat we are at currently for this show.\n\n129\n00:07:55.151 --> 00:08:00.689\nSays you wont be able to use the EAC\nto create searches, in Exchange Online.\n\n130\n00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:05.980\nPlease start using the Content Search\ninside our Security and Compliance.\n\n131\n00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.470\nAnd this is where you actually go for\nthat.\n\n132\n00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.660\nSo at this point you have two options and\nwhat you know Office\n\n133\n00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.940\n365 is recommending is that you\nselect the Content Search instead.\n\n134\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.010\nAnd once we do that we'll actually be back\nin the security and compliance center,\n\n135\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.350\nwhich I wont be able to say.\n\n136\n00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.400\nAnd then you simply select search and\ninvestigation.\n\n137\n00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.340\nAnd this will bring you\ninto the content search for\n\n138\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.730\nyou to add in the criteria that\nyou want to search through.\n\n139\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.200\nAnd this one will help you do it as well.\n\n140\n00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.800\nNow this one's a little bit more\ncomprehensive whereas the in place search\n\n141\n00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.200\nthat we were talking about,\nsearched only the mailboxes.\n\n142\n00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.350\nNotice this one it says searches for\ncontent and email in documents,\n\n143\n00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.550\nwhich means they're stored somewhere\nin my organization, inside of Skype for\n\n144\n00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:00.160\nBusiness conversation Teams data and\neven more.\n\n145\n00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.150\nSo this of course is\nthe more comprehensive tool\n\n146\n00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.980\nthat you may want to use.\n\n147\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:11.550\nAnd there is no way for me to tell you on\nthe exam it's gonna be one or the other.\n\n148\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.330\nYou just have to know about both.\n\n149\n00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:18.340\nBut the easy distinguishing feature\nhere right Is the content search here,\n\n150\n00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.480\nit does everything.\n\n151\n00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.430\nWhereas an in-place discovery and hold,\nit really is looking at mailboxes alone.\n\n152\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:30.330\nSo make sure you kind of understand\nthat one when you go in there,\n\n153\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.090\nand you take a look at\nthat search information.\n\n154\n00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.650\nThe great thing is,\nrelatively easy to do the search.\n\n155\n00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.820\nSo let's take a look at this contents\nsearch here for just a moment.\n\n156\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.170\nThat way if I click on new, it is here.\n\n157\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.080\nI can begin a search based on\nwhat I want it to look for.\n\n158\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.300\nSo I give this search a name.\n\n159\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.130\nSo it might be where I'm looking for\nDaniels search for whatever it might be.\n\n160\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.510\nAnd notice how long this name box is.\n\n161\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.980\nBecause I want you to be very\ndescriptive at the name box as well\n\n162\n00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.820\nespecially if you have multiple\nones of these going on.\n\n163\n00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.530\nNotice you can limit where you want it\nto look, you wanna search everywhere or\n\n164\n00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.690\ndo you want it to actually go\nto those custom locations.\n\n165\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.887\nBy default the custom location\nis the one that was set up.\n\n166\n00:10:16.887 --> 00:10:19.526\nBut notice that if I search everywhere,\n\n167\n00:10:19.526 --> 00:10:24.270\nI can actually select what I want\nit to search out, as well, okay?\n\n168\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.720\nSo those are the options that\nyou do have available to you.\n\n169\n00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:35.440\nSo let's take for example,\nthis is a simple test search,\n\n170\n00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.740\njust as an example And\nnow I could choose all mail boxes or\n\n171\n00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.870\nwhat mail boxes to actually look into,\nevery site or a specific share point site.\n\n172\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.060\nDon't search any public folders, or\ndo I still want to go into public folders.\n\n173\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.820\nSo you can see how comprehensive that they\nare willing to go throughout and do this.\n\n174\n00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.725\nAnd that makes it very valuable, right.\n\n175\n00:10:57.725 --> 00:11:01.230\nCuz we're no longer limited\nby my user account, or\n\n176\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.090\nyour user account when\nwe're doing the search.\n\n177\n00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:09.510\nThe eDiscovery is actually going to help\nus out here, to do what we need to, okay.\n\n178\n00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.760\nSo from that point,\nonce I select that I can click next.\n\n179\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.320\nAnd now I would actually have a list of\n\n180\n00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.630\nkey words that I would actually like\nto leave in there or I can do blank.\n\n181\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.450\nWell I'm not going to actually worry\nabout selecting key words cuz we're not\n\n182\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.890\ngonna save this too much here.\n\n183\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.350\nBut let's do it,\nI'm gonna do the word test.\n\n184\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.300\nCuz if there's any word that's\nappeared in my test emails.\n\n185\n00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:29.990\n&gt;&gt; Probably test.\n\n186\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.440\n&gt;&gt; It gonna be test, [LAUGH] more than\nlikely that is what is gonna be here.\n\n187\n00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.270\nAnd of course, you can add in\ndifferent conditional statements here.\n\n188\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.640\nIf you wanted to be able to help you out.\n\n189\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.700\nSo you can do for\na particular date and time.\n\n190\n00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:51.450\nSubject to who, message class,\ndocuments, authorship, you name it.\n\n191\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.950\nIt is all available to you to\ndo whatever you want And so\n\n192\n00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.192\nat that point that's what you do.\n\n193\n00:11:56.192 --> 00:12:00.098\nAnd then you would begin that search\nprocess which there's a search button\n\n194\n00:12:00.098 --> 00:12:01.836\nright there underneath delete.\n\n195\n00:12:01.836 --> 00:12:05.742\nAll right, so I'm gonna select cancel at\nthis point because we don't really need to\n\n196\n00:12:05.742 --> 00:12:09.580\nassert, there's nothing really there for\nus to have to look for.\n\n197\n00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.790\nBut overall though this may help you out\nat least in a beginning search if you\n\n198\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.490\nDo everything else.\n\n199\n00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.010\nNow most of us are not gonna sit here and\nwait for these results.\n\n200\n00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.996\nBecause if your organization is huge,\nit's gigantic,\n\n201\n00:12:22.996 --> 00:12:26.862\nit's not like I'm gonna sit here and\ngo all right, come on now just wait.\n\n202\n00:12:26.862 --> 00:12:31.775\nIt may take days, it may take longer\nbefore it actually finds every\n\n203\n00:12:31.775 --> 00:12:35.700\ninstance of the word\nWhatever we're looking for.\n\n204\n00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.660\nAnd that way it has to correlate and\n\n205\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.290\nwe have to actually bring that data\ninto place where now it can be managed.\n\n206\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.830\nWhat that means we have to be able\nto send it some place as well.\n\n207\n00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:52.130\nSo our next particular way of\nactually getting this set up Not only\n\n208\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.230\ndo we understand how to search for it and\nwhat our limitations are with the tools.\n\n209\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.710\nBut now we also have to set up\nwhat we call an eDiscovery site.\n\n210\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.060\nNow when we start talking\nabout an eDiscovery site,\n\n211\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.970\nthat's gotta bring into your mind, sites.\n\n212\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.380\nAre we talking about SharePoint?\n\n213\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:14.890\nWell, you definitely are beginning to talk\nabout then creating a SharePoint site.\n\n214\n00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.290\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n215\n00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.420\ndo that, the great thing is,\nSharePoint sites are not exactly complex.\n\n216\n00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.900\nAnd if we're using the web UI,\nit's relatively easy to configure,\n\n217\n00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.527\nif it actually lets me change over.\n\n218\n00:13:29.527 --> 00:13:31.960\nLet me get out of some of these tabs here.\n\n219\n00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.030\nI love the number of tabs it\njust brings up automatically.\n\n220\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.599\nIt's like you don't have anything\nelse better to do with your screen or\n\n221\n00:13:38.599 --> 00:13:40.273\nthe resources on your computer.\n\n222\n00:13:40.273 --> 00:13:41.072\nAll right, so\n\n223\n00:13:41.072 --> 00:13:45.680\nonce I'm in here, I need to go into well\nthe SharePoint admin center of course.\n\n224\n00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.100\nWhich means I come back down to\nthe admin icon, select share point.\n\n225\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.790\nAnd it's telling me, hey, Ronnie,\nyou have to sign back in to your account.\n\n226\n00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.275\nI just realized something,\nI mis-typed it, and\n\n227\n00:14:06.275 --> 00:14:11.976\nlet's see if I can actually type it\ncorrectly that time, there we go.\n\n228\n00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.810\nSo once I'm inside of my SharePoint site,\nmy site should populate right here.\n\n229\n00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.220\nAll we're going to do is we are going\nto create another SharePoint site\n\n230\n00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.230\nlike we did in previous episodes\nwhere we were talking about\n\n231\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.910\ncreating SharePoint\ncollection sites as well.\n\n232\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.000\nSo you can see the ones\nthat we created here.\n\n233\n00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.200\nGNV for Gainesville,\nLondon, NYC, TPA for Tampa.\n\n234\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.830\nThese are the ones that I've\nactually created in the past before.\n\n235\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:46.279\nHere's one for a search, but\nwe wanted to make one specifically just to\n\n236\n00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:50.150\nhandle the information from\nour eDiscovery searches, too.\n\n237\n00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.000\nAnd that is what we want to do next.\n\n238\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.970\nSo here, I'm going to select New.\n\n239\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.470\nWhen I do so,\nit is simply a private collection.\n\n240\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.840\nSo even though an e discovery collection\nit sounds like something fancy or\n\n241\n00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.520\na need discovery site sounds something\nfancy, it really isn't that fancy.\n\n242\n00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.220\nIt just sounds fancier here.\n\n243\n00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.320\nBut there is one difference\nthat we'll do here.\n\n244\n00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:18.360\nSo let's go ahead and\njust call this one our eDiscovery here.\n\n245\n00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.313\nYeah, let's do that, eDiscovery,\nand then for the site and\n\n246\n00:15:24.313 --> 00:15:26.298\nagain, we'll do eDiscovery.\n\n247\n00:15:29.805 --> 00:15:34.952\nAll right, now once we have this,\nthe difference Instead of doing what we\n\n248\n00:15:34.952 --> 00:15:41.560\nwould normally do which is a team site\nthat we'd have here under collaboration.\n\n249\n00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.980\nWe are gonna choose the enterprise tab.\n\n250\n00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.621\nAnd inside of enterprise tab what I\nwant is this one, the eDiscovery center.\n\n251\n00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:54.118\nBecause this is a template that's\nessentially saying, when you go and\n\n252\n00:15:54.118 --> 00:15:58.036\ndo the eDiscovery searches, you're gonna\npopulate the data and put it where?\n\n253\n00:15:58.036 --> 00:16:01.646\nWell, let me go ahead and set that up for\nyou in the format it needs to be in.\n\n254\n00:16:01.646 --> 00:16:05.270\nSo that's very nice of them to actually\ngo ahead and give us the template.\n\n255\n00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.380\nSelecting the time zone, so this is\nup to you where you want it selected.\n\n256\n00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.890\nI'm gonna put it in\nthe time zone that I'm in.\n\n257\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.649\nAnd of course, using the administrator\nwho's gonna own this site.\n\n258\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.350\nCheck the, there we go, Joey.\n\n259\n00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.510\nAnd then the storage coda.\n\n260\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.990\nOnce again, in terms of size.\n\n261\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.160\nThis depends, well,\nhow much you've actually bought,\n\n262\n00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.230\nis what this one depends on.\n\n263\n00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.920\nI'm not going to make it really big,\nbecause we're not really going to use it\n\n264\n00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.370\nthat much, and then change this\none down to about 100 here.\n\n265\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:34.770\nSo I'm not taking up a whole third.\n\n266\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.780\nBut you can actually do\nthat if you choose to.\n\n267\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.850\nSo that will go ahead and\ncreate this particular type.\n\n268\n00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.010\nThere's one or more pages.\n\n269\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.800\nIt exists already.\n\n270\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.490\nAll right,\nthat's because I probably made one.\n\n271\n00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.800\nSo we'll just call this\none ediscovery1 instead.\n\n272\n00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.810\nAnd we're actually gonna do another one\ninside of a PowerShell in just a moment,\n\n273\n00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.740\ntoo, so don't mistake that.\n\n274\n00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.510\nLet me go ahead and click OK.\n\n275\n00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.580\nAnd now,\n\n276\n00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.790\nyou'll notice it says it can take up to\n15 minutes before it creates the site.\n\n277\n00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:10.050\nAnd that will continue to kind of go\naround and round until it's done.\n\n278\n00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.560\nSo it does take a little bit of\ntime because it is SharePoint site\n\n279\n00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.290\nthat's getting replicated where?\n\n280\n00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.280\nThroughout your entire organization.\n\n281\n00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.830\nAnd even though you're\nonly connected to one,\n\n282\n00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.970\nyou don't have a clue where you're\nconnecting next, so it has to replicate\n\n283\n00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:27.080\nthroughout your entire structure there\nas everything is going on here, okay?\n\n284\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.340\nSo that's kind of the beginning, right?\n\n285\n00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.920\nBut like everything else,\nremember that for the exam.\n\n286\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.700\nThey test heavily using PowerShell and\n\n287\n00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.490\nthis is one of things you have to\nknow how to create in PowerShell.\n\n288\n00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.720\nThe great thing is you've seen it one\ntime already when we also created\n\n289\n00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.070\nthe SharePoint site using\nPowerShell as well, okay.\n\n290\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.810\nSo, but we're gonna show you this\none because it also includes\n\n291\n00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.120\nadding in a template to\nhelp us out as we do this.\n\n292\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.820\nWe're simply going to change it though,\nas this one is getting created here, I'm\n\n293\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.490\ngoing to go ahead and use the PowerShell\nconnection that I've already made.\n\n294\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:11.300\nSo, right here, hopefully everything is\nstill going on here, so let me make sure.\n\n295\n00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.720\nAnd you can see there it is.\n\n296\n00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.090\nThere's the one for Outlook.Office365.\n\n297\n00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.790\nAnd it is available.\n\n298\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.750\nAnd it's for Microsoft Exchange.\n\n299\n00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.050\nWe have to make that connection first.\n\n300\n00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.160\nWe don't make that connection,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n301\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.700\nWhatever you run, it's not gonna\nwork the way that we want to.\n\n302\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.570\nSo once I have it here and\n\n303\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:40.180\nwe are ready to go, I now need to\ncreate a new SharePoint site as well.\n\n304\n00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.862\nNow, on the SharePoint site,\n\n305\n00:18:41.862 --> 00:18:45.760\nit's supposed to actually have\nconnected to the SharePoint site too.\n\n306\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.870\nWell, if I don't have the SharePoint site,\n\n307\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.170\nlet me verify that I actually\ncan get back in here.\n\n308\n00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.690\nSo, let's do an import.\n\n309\n00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.480\nSo this is kind of a review then just in\ncase it didn't actually come through.\n\n310\n00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.405\nPut module,\nI thought it would show up here.\n\n311\n00:19:06.405 --> 00:19:11.100\nMicrosoft.online.sharepoint.\n\n312\n00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.910\nSo this is us connecting into SharePoint.\n\n313\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.210\nWe're going to disable the name\nchecking for right now,\n\n314\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.770\nand that looks like it took it there.\n\n315\n00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.150\nThen I'm going to connect to the actual\nSharePoint site or service, I should say.\n\n316\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:33.246\nI need a URL, and this one is going\n\n317\n00:19:33.246 --> 00:19:41.983\nto be\nhttps//officeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com,\n\n318\n00:19:41.983 --> 00:19:45.987\noops, I'm lying to you,\n\n319\n00:19:45.987 --> 00:19:51.265\nit's SharePoint, see -admin,\n\n320\n00:19:51.265 --> 00:19:57.110\nand instead, this is SharePoint.\n\n321\n00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.420\nThat's probably what I\ndid wrong the first time,\n\n322\n00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.940\nwhen I thought I connected\ninto SharePoint.\n\n323\n00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.570\nOnce I have that, I need to tell\nit credentials that I'm using,\n\n324\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.630\nand I've already set up the variable for\nmy credentials.\n\n325\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:11.180\nSo that should be good.\n\n326\n00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.285\nAnd we'll see here in a moment if\neverything is actually good or not,\n\n327\n00:20:15.285 --> 00:20:21.750\nget-SPOsite.\n\n328\n00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.830\nAnd we'll see if it actually lists\nout some SharePoint sites for me.\n\n329\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:32.630\nSo it is there, and you can see right\nhere, at least the last bit of it.\n\n330\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.690\nThe e-discovery site was created\ninside the EAC which is good.\n\n331\n00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:40.710\nNow, we have to create one inside or\nusing PowerShell, and\n\n332\n00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:44.790\nthat's just part of the exam requirements\nthat we have to be able to do.\n\n333\n00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.843\nSo let's make sure we get that one right,\ntoo.\n\n334\n00:20:47.843 --> 00:20:52.465\nNow, new-spo,\n\n335\n00:20:52.465 --> 00:20:57.087\noops, sposite,\n\n336\n00:20:57.087 --> 00:21:00.790\ncreate a URL.\n\n337\n00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:06.233\nAnd this one would be HTTPS, same thing,\n\n338\n00:21:06.233 --> 00:21:10.760\nofficeProdemoco.SharePoint.\n\n339\n00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.400\nNow this time I'm not\ndoing the admin side.\n\n340\n00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.659\nI'm not connecting in there.\n\n341\n00:21:14.719 --> 00:21:15.949\nI'll call it sites.\n\n342\n00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.240\nAnd then eDiscovery.\n\n343\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.910\nWe'll call this one 2, so\nwe can distinguish it.\n\n344\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.510\nAnd now I'm gonna set an owner for\nit and this will be Joey.\n\n345\n00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:30.050\nIf I can spell his name right,\n\n346\n00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:35.143\n@officeprodemoco on Microsoft\n\n347\n00:21:37.974 --> 00:21:39.316\n.com.\n\n348\n00:21:40.862 --> 00:21:43.060\nAnd then, I have to end with template.\n\n349\n00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.120\nNow, you can go out onto the internet and\n\n350\n00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.640\nyou can find a listing\nof the 50 templates.\n\n351\n00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:54.370\nI could be wrong, it's probably 30\ntemplates that you have available to you.\n\n352\n00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.770\nOff to do these sites.\n\n353\n00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:59.025\nThis one is EDISC and\n\n354\n00:21:59.025 --> 00:22:04.580\nwe're using the basic template,\n\n355\n00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.810\nwhich is going to be #0.\n\n356\n00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.760\nThis will be inside of our show notes.\n\n357\n00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.480\nSo if you're trying to scramble and copy\nthis all down, be careful because more\n\n358\n00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:20.820\nthan likely, and Daniel will tell you this\nfor sure, if anybody can mistype this,\n\n359\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.176\neven though I'm staring at it right in\nfront of me, it's gonna be me, okay?\n\n360\n00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:29.040\n[LAUGH] So\nI'm just trying to make sure before I hit\n\n361\n00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.210\nenter that I don't have any typo's\nleft over as far as I know,\n\n362\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.710\nit looks good, but if there's anybody\nthat can create a typo, it is myself.\n\n363\n00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.010\nAnd now it's gonna ask me for\na storage quota which is good.\n\n364\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.920\nI'm gonna set it for 100.\n\n365\n00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.510\nAnd now, the process of\nthe creation should begin and\n\n366\n00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:50.185\nwe should actually have that\nSharePoint collection site for\n\n367\n00:22:50.185 --> 00:22:54.010\ne-discovery setting up for\nus the way that we need to.\n\n368\n00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.840\nSo, we are having this process, and\n\n369\n00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.760\nthe whole reason behind this,\nright, is because more than likely,\n\n370\n00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.080\nscripting it out will be much faster for\nadmins to be able to do this,\n\n371\n00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:10.050\nrather than just going through\nthe SharePoint collection site to do so.\n\n372\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:14.500\nBut they do require you to at least know\nboth ways if you're going to begin to do\n\n373\n00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.670\nthis and that's what we'll actually\nend up seeing as we begin.\n\n374\n00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.860\nNow, there is another one that we're gonna\ntake a look at, but we're gonna go back\n\n375\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.860\ninto the Admin Center and the reason for\nthis is because you're more than\n\n376\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.830\nlikely going to see that the next step\nthat we have to do is we now need to\n\n377\n00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:37.790\nconfigure what is gonna be the source\nof what we were going to pull in here.\n\n378\n00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.440\nWhere as before, when we did the search,\nwe selected everything, well,\n\n379\n00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.460\nif you do that right, you're doing it\nthrough PowerShell, you have to do it for\n\n380\n00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.690\nall of the different services\nthat are available, each one.\n\n381\n00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:56.080\nSo, if I wanted to do it for exchange,\nI'd have to actually go through and\n\n382\n00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.540\nset it up for exchange in PowerShell.\n\n383\n00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.240\nThen, I'd also have to do\nthe same thing for SharePoint.\n\n384\n00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.600\nI'd have to do the same thing for\nOneDrive Business.\n\n385\n00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.600\nI need to do all those.\n\n386\n00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.710\nThere's not one single command that just\nsays, take all of Office 365 and do this.\n\n387\n00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:15.040\nSo, more than likely it's a little\nbit more of a bear and in that sense,\n\n388\n00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:20.690\nI doubt you're gonna see it on the exam,\nbut you still need to be able to configure\n\n389\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.660\nthe idea of the source of what we're\ntaking a look at so that we can do this.\n\n390\n00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:30.090\nSo we're gonna configure\nExchange as our result source,\n\n391\n00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.900\nis what we're going to do here.\n\n392\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:37.790\nSo let's go ahead and navigate in\nthen to one of our SharePoint sites.\n\n393\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:42.930\nNow right now, search is still search is\nbeing created, but as I thought I was done\n\n394\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:47.960\nsince it actually showed up, but it looks\nlike it's still taking us just a moment\n\n395\n00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.950\nand time here as it's winding\nits way through everything.\n\n396\n00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.560\nLet's see if it let's me click on it yet.\n\n397\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.880\nNope, not exactly yet.\n\n398\n00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.930\nSo once that gets through, I should be\nable to click on it and let's see if.\n\n399\n00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.670\nNope, it's still creating this one too.\n\n400\n00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:04.450\nSo hopefully I didn't.\n\n401\n00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.490\nI know I did eDiscovery too I was like\nhopefully I didn't name it the same\n\n402\n00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.570\nexact thing.\n\n403\n00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.230\nSo here e discovery one\nthat's what should happen.\n\n404\n00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.350\nIn just a few minutes here,\nwe should be able to go on but\n\n405\n00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.070\nit has to be done inside\nof that particular site.\n\n406\n00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.080\nWe can't just do it without.\n\n407\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.860\nSo we'll just have to wait here just for\na little brief\n\n408\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.680\nmoment as TV kind of allows us to kind\nof make the time go a little bit faster.\n\n409\n00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:33.960\nAnd so there's the quota that we're gonna\nenter in and that allows us to now create\n\n410\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.160\nthat second site that I have,\nbut I just realized something,\n\n411\n00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.980\nwe are running really short on time and\nI'm not gonna be able to complete it.\n\n412\n00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.130\nSo, Daniel, I think we may need to be\nable to pick up on another episode.\n\n413\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.940\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwhat a perfect stopping spot, right?\n\n414\n00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.360\nRonnie's got us right on the edge of our\nseat wondering what's gonna happen next\n\n415\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.455\nand then the clock ticks down to nothing,\nso.\n\n416\n00:25:52.455 --> 00:25:56.980\n[LAUGH] That is a really good natural\ntransition to move us into our lovely\n\n417\n00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.120\npart twos that we love so much, sir.\n\n418\n00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.570\nSo, Ronnie, thank you for\ngetting us this far.\n\n419\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.360\nWe look forward to seeing what\nhappens in the next show.\n\n420\n00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.040\nSo definitely come back for that.\n\n421\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.960\nAs for this one, looks like it's time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n422\n00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.800\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n423\n00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.680\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n424\n00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.066\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n425\n00:26:13.066 --> 00:26:19.090\n[MUSIC]\n\n426\n00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.180\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:08.289\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.330\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.782\n&gt;&gt; Hello welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.570\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\n\n7\n00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.299\nand today we're doing our\nenabling Office 365 Services.\n\n8\n00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:25.084\nAnd in this episode we're actually\ncontinuing our thought process on\n\n9\n00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:26.570\nconfiguring eDiscovery.\n\n10\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.496\nThis is a part two, so if you missed\npart one, make sure you go back and\n\n11\n00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:30.310\nwatch that first.\n\n12\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.160\nCuz we did a lot of the important setup,\nright?\n\n13\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.340\nWe talked about why we would do\neDiscovery, and we got those SharePoint\n\n14\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.800\nsites set up so that we can go on and\nconfigure our eDiscovery.\n\n15\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.152\nHere to show us how to do all that is Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n16\n00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:44.240\nWelcome back, Ronnie.\n\n17\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.230\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you again for\n\n18\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.860\nhaving me on the show as we take\na look at this part two on eDiscovery.\n\n19\n00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.170\nAs we finished up the initial part,\nwe were kind of right in the middle,\n\n20\n00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.340\nand we had to take a fairly long pause to\nmake sure that everything was working.\n\n21\n00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.349\nBut the reason why we actually had\nto do that, and it gives us a great\n\n22\n00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:09.303\nlead in to the part two here, is that we\nwere configuring those SharePoint sites.\n\n23\n00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:14.640\nAnd we showed you how to do that using,\nof course, the SharePoint Admin Center.\n\n24\n00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.471\nWhen you go into site collections and\ncreating it there.\n\n25\n00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:19.419\nBut then we also switched over, of course,\n\n26\n00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:24.449\nto the PowerShell connection,\nthat we also have into SharePoint Online.\n\n27\n00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:26.680\nAnd we showed you how to create it there.\n\n28\n00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.810\nAnd there is something that\nI can now tell you, and\n\n29\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.490\nsomething that you should think\nabout before you do this.\n\n30\n00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.790\nDo not create two sites at the same time.\n\n31\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.470\nIt takes a lot longer, even though you get\na message in the Admin Center that says,\n\n32\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410\nit should only take 15 minutes.\n\n33\n00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.190\nIt took over an hour before\neverything really did get completed.\n\n34\n00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.860\nSo, I wasn't thinking that.\n\n35\n00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860\nI was just thinking about getting\nthe show done and I thought, that's fine.\n\n36\n00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.900\nWe'll create one in the admin center\nthrough the web UI and then, we'll come\n\n37\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.830\nover to PowerShell and we'll create\nanother one, should take 15 minutes.\n\n38\n00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.640\nIt took over an hour before\neverything was completed.\n\n39\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.700\nSo we kind of wrapped that up and\n\n40\n00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.070\nsaid, it will complete, and we'll be able\nto see the results of that fairly easily.\n\n41\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.190\nSo that's what we're actually taking\na look at right here at the beginning.\n\n42\n00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.514\nAnd then we need to move on to\ntake a look, of course, then,\n\n43\n00:02:13.514 --> 00:02:16.909\nonce we got the set up of where\nthe data's gonna end up going.\n\n44\n00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.133\nWe now need to set up where\nthe data's coming from as well, and\n\n45\n00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.490\nthat's what we're gonna be tackling next.\n\n46\n00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.546\nSo let's go ahead and see.\n\n47\n00:02:23.546 --> 00:02:28.700\nI left the screen as close as I could\nto where it was when I left off.\n\n48\n00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.130\nSo if you pick up from part one, and\n\n49\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.490\nif you haven't,\nI'll show you exactly what we did.\n\n50\n00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.430\nRight down here was kinda the last\nline that we took a look at,\n\n51\n00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.690\nwhat I had typed it.\n\n52\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.470\nSo here it is, New-SPOSite, remember\nthat an eDiscovery site is really just\n\n53\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.490\na private site collection, but\nusing the eDiscovery template, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.660\nSo this is where you see SPO and,\nof course, the URL.\n\n55\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.890\nThe owner, but\n\n56\n00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.940\nhere's where I wanted to concentrate on,\nwhich is this idea of the template.\n\n57\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.900\nAdding that template in,\nit can cause issues,\n\n58\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.990\nsometimes it might take\na little bit longer.\n\n59\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.610\nBut overall though, what really got\nme is two sites at the same time.\n\n60\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.040\nThat's what really got me.\n\n61\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.000\nNow at the very end, you end up seeing\nsomething that looks pretty much,\n\n62\n00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.850\nyou'll get the blinking cursor\nright here at your prompt.\n\n63\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.160\nAnd I wanted to check as we came back in,\nbecause it's actually the following day\n\n64\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.950\nthat we're doing this,\nwhether it was still connected or not.\n\n65\n00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.410\nSo I ended up just running\nthe Get-SPOSite, so that way I can see.\n\n66\n00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.760\nAnd now you can see a couple of things,\nright?\n\n67\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.020\nHere is that eDiscovery 2 in which this\nparticular line was allowing me to create.\n\n68\n00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.650\nSo there is the PowerShell command\nthat allowed me to create this site.\n\n69\n00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.326\nYou can see owner and\nowner shows up here too.\n\n70\n00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:51.760\nAnd then it used that template,\nlike we said, for the eDiscovery.\n\n71\n00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.300\nAnd that is key if you're gonna\ncreate a SharePoint discovery site,\n\n72\n00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.290\nespecially inside of PowerShell.\n\n73\n00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.690\nWithout that template, you'll create\na regular document collection but\n\n74\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.940\nit won't have the templates\nkind of preset so\n\n75\n00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.410\nit can accept all of that discovery\ndata that's gonna come in.\n\n76\n00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.620\nSo we wanna make sure that that's good.\n\n77\n00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.460\nAnd we also the see the one\nthat I created inside of\n\n78\n00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.490\nthe SharePoint admin center as well.\n\n79\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.010\nThe same thing, I mean,\nit's pretty much identical.\n\n80\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.710\nThe only thing that I\ndid differently here,\n\n81\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.430\nwhich I thought was probably what\nheld me up, is the storage quota.\n\n82\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.268\nI apparently made this 100 GB instead.\n\n83\n00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:30.065\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which I made this one 1 GB and\n\n84\n00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:32.573\nthis one I think I made 102.\n\n85\n00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:37.041\nSo 100 GB, I thought it was 10\nGB when I first looked at it.\n\n86\n00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:39.140\nI was like, that shouldn't take long.\n\n87\n00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.510\nI realized something in earlier episodes\nthat if I created a 1 GB storage quota,\n\n88\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.110\nit created within two or three minutes.\n\n89\n00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.156\n10 GB or 100 GB, it took it\na lot longer to actually create.\n\n90\n00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.220\n&gt;&gt; A lot of space to allocate.\n\n91\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.052\n&gt;&gt; A lot of space to allocate.\n\n92\n00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:56.762\nThe other thing that I knew we were\ngoing to be doing on the show,\n\n93\n00:04:56.762 --> 00:05:00.710\nis that I had to get connected\ninto Exchange Online as well.\n\n94\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.840\nSo I had to see if that happened,\nand even during that point, right,\n\n95\n00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.460\nit ended up broken.\n\n96\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.447\nSo I simply ran the commands again and\nyou're gonna see, here it is saying,\n\n97\n00:05:09.447 --> 00:05:11.190\nhey look, you've already run this stuff.\n\n98\n00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.660\nAnd then at the end here you\nmight see a little bit of red.\n\n99\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.340\nSo it's adding all that in.\n\n100\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.700\nBut it's just saying look,\neverything is there, but\n\n101\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.470\nnow notice now it's showing as opened.\n\n102\n00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.710\nSo we still need to do\nsome Exchange stuff, and\n\n103\n00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.370\nthat's why we're seeing what\nwe're seeing here, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.780\nBut the next thing that we're gonna take a\nlook at though is what I was talking about\n\n105\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.160\nhere, which is getting to the idea\nof setting a result, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160\nA source for the results to come in.\n\n107\n00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.320\nSo if I switch back over to\nthe SharePoint admin center,\n\n108\n00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.000\nyou can now see there are the two sites,\nand they're both listed as new for me.\n\n109\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.670\nAnd of course there is that\n100 GB resource quota for\n\n110\n00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.590\nthe storage limit under here.\n\n111\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.158\nAnd I set this one up as 100 for\nthe resource.\n\n112\n00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:02.003\nNow the eDiscovery two is\ngonna be problematic, and\n\n113\n00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:05.634\nthat's because I forgot to set\nthe resource quota over here to 0.\n\n114\n00:06:05.634 --> 00:06:09.320\nI probably should have at least set it\nto 100, is what I should have done.\n\n115\n00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.252\nSo we're primarily gonna\nwork with eDiscovery 1.\n\n116\n00:06:11.252 --> 00:06:13.450\nNow can I change that if I want to?\n\n117\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.760\nSure, I can select that and in here,\n\n118\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.350\nlet's see if I get to the properties,\nis inside of the web address here.\n\n119\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.920\nBut I can probably set the usage limit.\n\n120\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.910\nBut for right now,\nthat's what we really wanted to see,\n\n121\n00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.960\nis that ability to understand\nthat this is going on.\n\n122\n00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.470\nI didn't really need that eDiscovery tool.\n\n123\n00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.940\nI just wanted to show you\nthat to us in PowerShell.\n\n124\n00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.525\nMake sure you remember\nthat template little tag.\n\n125\n00:06:38.525 --> 00:06:44.350\nThe EDISC#0, or hash.\n\n126\n00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.190\n&gt;&gt; And did you use the same template no\nmatter which way you created the site?\n\n127\n00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.550\nWhether you created it through the GUI,\n\n128\n00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.480\nwhether you created it through PowerShell,\nstill the same template?\n\n129\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's the same thing.\n\n130\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.260\nAnything you can see inside\nof the actual web UI,\n\n131\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.450\nyou're pretty much going to guarantee\nthat it's gonna be in PowerShell first.\n\n132\n00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.450\nNow, some of these templates\nhave changed over time.\n\n133\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.850\nBut that e 0 is pretty much\nsaying first template.\n\n134\n00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.710\nAnd usually the default that you create\nespecially on eDiscovery site inside of\n\n135\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.000\nthe web UI is gonna be\nthat default template.\n\n136\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.380\nSo that's the one that I ended\nup choosing for that one, too.\n\n137\n00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:24.160\nSo now let's get into the idea here of\nmaking sure that we can now configure\n\n138\n00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.750\nExchange Online as our source,\nright, of the data that's coming in.\n\n139\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.750\nNow inside of eDiscovery,\n\n140\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.950\nremember that you can do this\nnot only in Exchange, right?\n\n141\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.146\nWe can also do this for SharePoint\ncollections that we want eDiscovery to be\n\n142\n00:07:40.146 --> 00:07:43.421\nable to go through what it wants\nto as well as our OneDrive.\n\n143\n00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.421\nOneDrive, yeah, that's right.\n\n144\n00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:48.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking of SkyDrive and\n\n145\n00:07:48.045 --> 00:07:49.650\nI was like, SkyDrive?\n\n146\n00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.150\nNo, that's not right anymore.\n\n147\n00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.615\nBut OneDrive for Business, we can tell it,\ndon't just look in Exchange.\n\n148\n00:07:55.615 --> 00:08:00.194\nBut we want to actually be able to do\nExchange here, is what we want to do.\n\n149\n00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:02.955\nBut if you do the other ones,\nyou have to make sure that you,\n\n150\n00:08:02.955 --> 00:08:04.293\nThat you do set it up for H1.\n\n151\n00:08:04.293 --> 00:08:07.530\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, this is something\nmaybe the organization would decide.\n\n152\n00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.070\nOr maybe industry regulations like hip or\nsomething would determine\n\n153\n00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.570\nwhat inforamation we need to\nsend this eDiscovery site?\n\n154\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.690\n&gt;&gt; That's normally what will end up\nhappening, is if it's not something like\n\n155\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.410\na regulation, it's because of a lawsuit or\na case that's been brought that says\n\n156\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.040\nexactly what we needed to have\ninside of that eDiscovery site.\n\n157\n00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.320\nNow, that, of course,\nwill also determine other things,\n\n158\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.020\nsuch as your storage quota and\nhow much storage that you actually need.\n\n159\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.330\nIt would be a shame of me to actually\nset like a 1 gig quota like I did,\n\n160\n00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.460\nand then realize that I have to\npull email, as well as files, and\n\n161\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.490\neverything from OneDrive for Business and\nSharePoint, as well as emails.\n\n162\n00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.810\nAnd then, there it is.\n\n163\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.740\nMy storage limit is 1 gig.\n\n164\n00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.380\nThat would be silly.\n\n165\n00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.460\nBut the great thing is, you can\nchange those like what we said here.\n\n166\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.370\nAnd that's something that\nwe do have to realize.\n\n167\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.200\nBut at the very beginning when we start\ntalking about that idea of setting\n\n168\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.680\nthe source, this again could be determined\nonce again like what we said here.\n\n169\n00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.210\nWhether it's the regulation or\n\n170\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:14.130\nit's going to be something like here's the\nlegal case and what they're asking for and\n\n171\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.500\nare they only asking me for\nemails or are they asking me for\n\n172\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.020\neverything that has an election to\nthis particular keyword that I have.\n\n173\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.460\nWell, if I have to do a search line that\nI can't just limit it to exchange but\n\n174\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.950\nany company would probably tell\nyou in terms of their security and\n\n175\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.290\nlegal team like, only give what's asked,\ndon't open the door and\n\n176\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.530\njust go, here, let me volunteer more and\nmore information.\n\n177\n00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.320\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n178\n00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.090\nI am not a legal scholar.\n\n179\n00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.477\nI'm not a lawyer so\ndon't quote me on that and go, but\n\n180\n00:09:42.477 --> 00:09:45.012\nRonnie said you should of course do that.\n\n181\n00:09:45.012 --> 00:09:48.219\nBut I'm just saying,\nat least from my prospective,\n\n182\n00:09:48.219 --> 00:09:52.142\nI would think that at least you're\nlegal advisor would say, no,\n\n183\n00:09:52.142 --> 00:09:55.870\nthey said emails,\nlet's just limit it to exchange.\n\n184\n00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.770\nSo you wanna be able to do that.\n\n185\n00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.220\nAnd the great thing is,\nyou can do all three.\n\n186\n00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.750\nBut the idea of actually saying,\n\n187\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.380\nlook, we're gonna limit this to Exchange\nmeans it's gonna take a lot faster,\n\n188\n00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.930\nbecause really only indexing\nExchange to do this then.\n\n189\n00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.340\nIf you do all three it may\ntake a long time before\n\n190\n00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.850\nthat eDiscovery finishes doing\neverything that it needs to.\n\n191\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.410\nBecause when you start thinking about\nindexing One Drive for Business and\n\n192\n00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.003\nyou have thousands, a hundred thousand,\nmillions of files, and\n\n193\n00:10:23.003 --> 00:10:28.080\nyour SharePoint and you've got 20, 30\nsites that have a ton of stuff in it and\n\n194\n00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.860\nemails and hundreds of thousands\nif not millions at some point.\n\n195\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.797\nThen it has to go through an index of\neverything then pull out all the ones with\n\n196\n00:10:37.797 --> 00:10:42.620\nthose keywords in it, I mean that\ncan take an insane amount of time.\n\n197\n00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.570\nSo for you in terms of efficiency,\n\n198\n00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.970\nlimiting it to what you want is pretty\nmuch what you'd want to be able to do.\n\n199\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.600\nSo we're just gonna use\nExchange to really focus in\n\n200\n00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.290\non what we want because let's face it.\n\n201\n00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:02.680\nIf anything, especially in communication\nmatters, Exchange is probably gonna\n\n202\n00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.070\nbe the basic one at least as far as\nall the communication processes go on.\n\n203\n00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.366\nSo that's the one we're gonna configure.\n\n204\n00:11:09.366 --> 00:11:14.260\nNow, we're going to do this inside of\nthe Web UI and that is because, well one,\n\n205\n00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:19.280\nthe PowerShell itself is a little bit\nmore of a nightmare than we think.\n\n206\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.660\nIt's not only three or four commands.\n\n207\n00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.300\nIt's like six or seven and\nnone of them are easy in that sense.\n\n208\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.620\nCan you go and find the way to do this?\n\n209\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.304\nYes, you definitely can.\n\n210\n00:11:30.304 --> 00:11:32.970\nBut the very fact is,\nyou're preparing for the exam.\n\n211\n00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.840\nI'd really hate to make you go, here's\nwhat you need to know for the exam for\n\n212\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.390\nthis one, and\nnow you're saying are you joking me?\n\n213\n00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.963\nI really have to be able to do all, and\nI think that the complexity of it really\n\n214\n00:11:44.963 --> 00:11:48.107\nrules it out as something\nthat is gonna be able to go,\n\n215\n00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:52.838\nlet me examine the whole thing here, and\nsee what is actually wrong with this.\n\n216\n00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:55.735\nEspecially if they list four or five of\nthem for you to pick through, which of\n\n217\n00:11:55.735 --> 00:11:57.439\nthe following is gonna enable this-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:11:57.439 --> 00:11:58.480\n&gt;&gt; In PowerShell?\n\n219\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.320\nSo I could be wrong, but I don't\nbelieve I am going to be wrong on this.\n\n220\n00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.720\nSo let's take a look at how we make sure\nthat we go and configure what we need to.\n\n221\n00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.888\nSo let's take for\nan example as we do this,\n\n222\n00:12:11.888 --> 00:12:15.059\nI'm gonna pick my eDiscovery here, one.\n\n223\n00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:17.136\nNow, I just realized something now, Mike,\n\n224\n00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:20.688\nI pointed at the wrong place when I said\nthat we could set that resource quota,\n\n225\n00:12:20.688 --> 00:12:23.500\nwhere you actually see it\nover here as being zero.\n\n226\n00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.730\nI clicked on it and I said, it's probably\nup here in and like ooh, it's not there.\n\n227\n00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.590\nBut I just realized something just\nby looking at it, look at that,\n\n228\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.600\nit's actually right here,\nserver resource quota.\n\n229\n00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.335\nSo let me make sure that everybody\nsees that before they go,\n\n230\n00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:40.170\nRonnie didn't know exactly what\nhe was talking about here.\n\n231\n00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.308\nI did, I just didn't remember\nwhere it was right then.\n\n232\n00:12:42.308 --> 00:12:44.296\nBut if I put a check mark there, and\n\n233\n00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:47.720\nthen I can select the set\nserver resource quota.\n\n234\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.880\nNotice on this one where I set to 0,\nI can set it to 100 at this point.\n\n235\n00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.070\nI'm not worried about sending\nan email off right now.\n\n236\n00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.350\nThen, I'm gonna click\nSave on that if I can.\n\n237\n00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.054\nAnd it should be setting it so\n\n238\n00:13:02.054 --> 00:13:06.248\nit's gonna take a little bit of time\nas its being loaded which is fine.\n\n239\n00:13:06.248 --> 00:13:08.960\nSo that may take up to 15 minutes,\nfor all I know.\n\n240\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.720\nBut if I want to set a resource, or\n\n241\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.590\na source for eDiscovery one,\nthis is where I do have to select\n\n242\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:25.180\nthe side collection, and I also have to go\ninto it's own admin portal essentially.\n\n243\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.289\nSo I'm gonna click on the website address.\n\n244\n00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.850\nAnd once I'm in the website address,\nI love how all these tabs keep popping up.\n\n245\n00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.930\nMike, you've heard me say this\nbefore in a previous episode,\n\n246\n00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.660\nit is one of the things\nthat bugs me to no end.\n\n247\n00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:44.100\nBut that's just the way, at least default\nin my settings here, allow me to do this.\n\n248\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.290\nNow, once we get here,\n\n249\n00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.380\nthere are a couple of funny things\nthat can happen here, Mike.\n\n250\n00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.020\nIt didn't happen to me today and I don't\nknow if it's because I'm using the Edge\n\n251\n00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.990\nbrowser or not but I have began to do some\nof these different things where I have had\n\n252\n00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:03.190\nto come in and change site\nsettings inside of SharePoint and\n\n253\n00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.770\nthese buttons were gone,\nin other words, they did not appear.\n\n254\n00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.240\nAnd like I said, it could be my machine or\nit could be something with Edge.\n\n255\n00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.557\nSo there are times when these didn't even\nshow up, like the first time I tried to go\n\n256\n00:14:15.557 --> 00:14:20.064\nin and change some of the settings, it was\nsaying, click on settings, and I looked,\n\n257\n00:14:20.064 --> 00:14:24.520\nand it says, click on the gear, and\nI was like, where the heck is the gear?\n\n258\n00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.110\nAnd then, I hovered over and\nit finally showed up, so\n\n259\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.880\nI don't know if that's\na version issue with\n\n260\n00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.320\nwhatever Edge version I was using at\nthe point, but it was the same one, but\n\n261\n00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.130\nI did see it actually not appear so\nsometimes you have to search for it.\n\n262\n00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.450\n&gt;&gt; That's a good little gotcha there.\n\n263\n00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.633\nSo don't panic if you don't see\nthose icons, maybe refresh the page,\n\n264\n00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:47.922\nclose your browser, open it again,\nor even try a different browser, but\n\n265\n00:14:47.922 --> 00:14:49.908\neventually they'll show up, fantastic.\n\n266\n00:14:49.908 --> 00:14:51.592\nAnd that's the results of our template,\n\n267\n00:14:51.592 --> 00:14:53.492\nyou haven't don't\nanything to the site yet.\n\n268\n00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:57.460\n&gt;&gt; Nothing yet, so right now we just\npretty much have this basic template and\n\n269\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.580\nit's really not a lot that's going on.\n\n270\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.660\nYou can see where it gives you access\nto be able to create cases, and\n\n271\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.970\nof course, the site contents.\n\n272\n00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.130\nWe're not gonna get\ninto that right now but\n\n273\n00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.310\nwe do need to set up because\nthere's nothing there.\n\n274\n00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.360\nWe do need to at least set up where that\nresource is gonna be which is gonna be\n\n275\n00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.930\nthe gear.\n\n276\n00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.452\nAnd once I actually select the gear,\nI'm going to select site settings.\n\n277\n00:15:19.181 --> 00:15:20.740\nAnd now, this is it.\n\n278\n00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.390\nSo it's strange where you see that site.\n\n279\n00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.270\nBut they really did hide\nthe Admin Center very well,\n\n280\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.420\neven from the admins, where you're\nnot gonna find it very easily.\n\n281\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.920\nAnd like I said, the first time I did it,\nwhen I was trying to do the eDiscovery,\n\n282\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.050\nI was like, wait a minute, there is no\nsetting here for admin settings at all,\n\n283\n00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.570\nor for site settings,\nwhere in the world is this thing?\n\n284\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:41.610\nAnd I did.\n\n285\n00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.340\nI hunted all over this page,\nI was like, there is nothing there.\n\n286\n00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.680\nI clicked on every link, finally,\nI happened to hover over it and\n\n287\n00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.200\nit kinda showed up and then when I took\nit away, it didn't show up anymore.\n\n288\n00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.068\nI was like, that's kinda weird\nto hide it that way, but\n\n289\n00:15:54.068 --> 00:15:56.584\nsomething like that can happen so\njust be aware.\n\n290\n00:15:56.584 --> 00:15:57.953\n&gt;&gt; It was a blink button.\n\n291\n00:15:57.953 --> 00:16:01.786\n&gt;&gt; I know, it does kinda set that\nup a little bit unusually here.\n\n292\n00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:05.131\nNow once we're in here, you can see, Mike,\n\n293\n00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:10.160\nthat where this might be a little\nbit more of a challenge for us.\n\n294\n00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.120\nNow if you're masterful at exchange,\nat setting up eDiscovery there,\n\n295\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.310\nespecially on exchange online,\nit's not really big, or indifferent.\n\n296\n00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.260\nBut the problem is,\nif this is your first time doing it, Mike,\n\n297\n00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.020\nlook at all the stuff\nthat's actually right here.\n\n298\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.240\nAnd it's not like it's a small grouping,\nright.\n\n299\n00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.580\nAll the sudden I go from users and\npermissions, and notice, people, groups,\n\n300\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.710\nsite permissions, site collections and\nadministrators, site app permissions.\n\n301\n00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.750\nLook and feel has five different options.\n\n302\n00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.090\nSite actions has five.\n\n303\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.670\nWeb does, all the sudden.\n\n304\n00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.470\nCrud, look at that.\n\n305\n00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.080\nSite collection and administration.\n\n306\n00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:49.970\nAll of these different ones that we had\nset up here, it now begins to get a little\n\n307\n00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.800\nbit more challenging on what we're\nlooking for, to give us what we need.\n\n308\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.630\nI mean, that is now going to be were,\nlike so\n\n309\n00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.100\nwhat in the world are we\nactually looking for.\n\n310\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.987\nWell, it comes down to, when we're\nsetting up a resource, it's gonna be\n\n311\n00:17:04.987 --> 00:17:09.894\nunder Site Collection Administration,\nand then Search Result Sources.\n\n312\n00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.500\nYeah, it's-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just gonna say, Ronnie,\n\n313\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.850\nwhen you first pulled up that list,\nit was a little bit daunting,\n\n314\n00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:19.871\nbut I know you're here and\nyou're gonna guide us.\n\n315\n00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:21.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And show us which ones we actually need\n\n316\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.490\nto pay attention to, right?\n\n317\n00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.080\nBecause we don't need to go through\nevery single one of those options\n\n318\n00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.330\nto get this done, right?\n\n319\n00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kind of the key.\n\n320\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.750\nAnd if you think about it as\nyou're getting ready for the exam,\n\n321\n00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:36.500\nif they show you something like this, you\ncan imagine that, again, I can't tell you\n\n322\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.590\nexactly what they're gonna show you on\nthe exam, but you can imagine, let's say,\n\n323\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:44.560\nthey might show a screen shot of,\nyou know, something like this, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.560\nOr just ones with search in it.\n\n325\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.830\nLet's just put it that way, and\n\n326\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.750\nthey're saying which of the following\nis going to give you that?\n\n327\n00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.280\nAnd you can at least limit it down to,\n\n328\n00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.160\nlet's say, these first three or\ntwo, right?\n\n329\n00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.360\nSo, if you go to Search Result Sources,\nand\n\n330\n00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.810\nsearch result types,\nyou now at least have a 50-50 chance.\n\n331\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:09.110\nBut if I were to say, all right,\nhere's your kind of screenshot and\n\n332\n00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.400\nyou've never seen it before and, Mike,\n\n333\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.590\nthis is kind of a big thing that\nI wanna emphasize for the exam.\n\n334\n00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.570\nThere's no way on this exam in particular\n\n335\n00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.990\nthat we are gonna get away with\njust going, I read that in a book.\n\n336\n00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.610\nI memorized exactly which one,\nwhen they show you this,\n\n337\n00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.910\nall of a sudden that memory just\nkind of disappears very quickly.\n\n338\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.380\nAnd then Search Result Sources and\n\n339\n00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.420\nSearch Results Types,\nthey almost blur in your mind.\n\n340\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.750\nSure, it's this one and\nthen you make the wrong selection.\n\n341\n00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.890\nSo you gotta spend time.\n\n342\n00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.535\nThere is no other way that you're\ngonna be able to do this if you don't\n\n343\n00:18:42.535 --> 00:18:43.540\nspend time in it.\n\n344\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just looking at it for\nme for the first time,\n\n345\n00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.310\nif you zoom back out, I see under the site\ncollection administration there is\n\n346\n00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.330\nSearch Result Sources and\nSearch Result Types.\n\n347\n00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.270\nBut under search there is\nalso result sources and\n\n348\n00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.230\nresult types over in\nthe bottom left hand side.\n\n349\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.310\nSo it really looks like I have\ntwo search result sources and\n\n350\n00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.280\ntwo search result sites,\nthat can get very confusing.\n\n351\n00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.190\n&gt;&gt; It really can.\n\n352\n00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.410\nAnd so this is why, especially because\nwe're doing this for the administration\n\n353\n00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:13.420\npart, we've got to make sure that we\nset this up correctly for that side.\n\n354\n00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.850\nNow on this side, when you do this search,\nyou're kind of setting this one up for\n\n355\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:21.040\nthe end user to go, here's how you're\ngoing to do your searches, but\n\n356\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.890\nit is under the administration part and\nwe're saying.\n\n357\n00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.024\nAll right, this is for\n\n358\n00:19:24.024 --> 00:19:27.380\nstuff that we really need to make\nsure that happens in what we want.\n\n359\n00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.050\nSo we're gonna select of course,\nthe Search Result Sources and\n\n360\n00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.940\nlet me make sure I said that correctly.\n\n361\n00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.250\nAnd once I do that,\nlet's see it's going to change.\n\n362\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:42.690\nAnd now, we have the site collection\nadministration and manage result sources.\n\n363\n00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:47.130\nSo it's from this particular\npoint that as we take a look\n\n364\n00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.650\nthen I can select this tiny little link.\n\n365\n00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.860\nYou would think,\n\n366\n00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.380\nMike, as low as my resolution is,\nthis thing would be gigantic.\n\n367\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.510\nBut notice that even in comparison and\nI know Mike has excellent eye sight,\n\n368\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.795\nthat's why I'm pointing this out.\n\n369\n00:20:01.795 --> 00:20:03.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But even in comparison to this,\n\n370\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.570\nand it looks small on\nthe screen right now, right?\n\n371\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.780\nBut look, doesn't that look smaller?\n\n372\n00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.400\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n373\n00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.770\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it really does.\n\n374\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.070\nAnd if I zoom in, you can see, it is.\n\n375\n00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.100\nIt's a much smaller font.\n\n376\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.590\nIt's like they really don't want you\n\n377\n00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.570\ndoing anything like this even though\nthey've listed it at the top.\n\n378\n00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:24.480\nThey've made it so diminutive,\nit is amazing as we start to see this.\n\n379\n00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.860\nSo I know you'll probably say,\nRodney, I don't care.\n\n380\n00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.080\nJust click on the button and let's go on.\n\n381\n00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.770\nWell, that's the fun that I get to have,\nright?\n\n382\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.530\nThis is what we're taking a look at here.\n\n383\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.240\nSo, here it is.\n\n384\n00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.240\nWe've got a nice little note that says,\nresult source will be available to all\n\n385\n00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.690\nsites in this collection to make one just\nfor this site, use site result sources.\n\n386\n00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.860\nSo this is a little bit different\nhere where it's saying,\n\n387\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.480\nhey, are you sure you want\nthis available for everyone or\n\n388\n00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.375\ndo you want it just only available for\nyour one eDiscovery site?\n\n389\n00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:58.380\nSo for us, we're actually gonna just\nleave it at the default for right now.\n\n390\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.540\nAnd make sure that we\ndo a couple of things.\n\n391\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.750\n&gt;&gt; So we did basically have\nto go through this for\n\n392\n00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.900\neach source that we wanted to setup for\nour eDiscovery?\n\n393\n00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.790\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, Mike,\nthat's a great point to make,\n\n394\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.470\nthat if we're going to do this for more\nthan the exchange that we're going to do,\n\n395\n00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.340\nwe would have to do this for\nevery one of those resources as we do so.\n\n396\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.560\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat how we are going to this and\n\n397\n00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.550\nit's just really filling it in as\nwhat we have access to be able to do.\n\n398\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.160\nLet me just make sure I'm zoomed out so\n\n399\n00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.270\nI can get access to the bar here,\nto the scroll bar.\n\n400\n00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.370\nAnd now notice it says a name.\n\n401\n00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.430\nName must be unique at each\nadministrative level, for\n\n402\n00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.310\nexample, two result sources\nin site can't share a name.\n\n403\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:42.580\nBut one in a site, and\none provided by the site collection can.\n\n404\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.980\nSo if you have two different levels,\nrealize no big deal.\n\n405\n00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.540\nYou can do the same name, but two of them\nat the same time, don't just set up like\n\n406\n00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.970\nI'm trying to think of a name that I\nwanna set up and can't even think about.\n\n407\n00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.560\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say you know while it\nmight be possible if there are different\n\n408\n00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.470\nadministrative levels\nto use the same name.\n\n409\n00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not a good idea.\n\n410\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.640\n&gt;&gt; Why yeah that's just\ngonna cause confusion,\n\n411\n00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.792\nget creative if you're not\ncreative enough like me,\n\n412\n00:22:07.792 --> 00:22:11.014\nif I'm Ronnie, he'll come up with\nsome really cool name for your site.\n\n413\n00:22:11.014 --> 00:22:12.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there you go.\n\n414\n00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:17.332\nSo on this one, I'm just gonna\ncall it Exchange, let's just do,\n\n415\n00:22:17.332 --> 00:22:23.123\nI was trying to do eDiscovery, but\nthe only way I can do it is eDiscovery.\n\n416\n00:22:23.123 --> 00:22:24.960\nSo, we'll do that.\n\n417\n00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.810\nGive it, of course,\n\n418\n00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.960\na description if you really can't\ncome up with something creative.\n\n419\n00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.480\nThis is at least descriptive for\nyour choices here too.\n\n420\n00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.730\nNow of course,\n\n421\n00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.910\nyou actually do need to know what\nparticular SharePoint you're looking for.\n\n422\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.840\nResults from the index of\nthis search service itself or\n\n423\n00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.190\nare you running at a guest a remote one.\n\n424\n00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.960\nSelect the exchange for\nresults from exchange.\n\n425\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.390\nI'm thinking that this description\nat least as intuitive here.\n\n426\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking Exchange\n\n427\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.440\nmight be the good choice for\nsetting up Exchange as a source.\n\n428\n00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that I think you are correct, so\nI'm not gonna contradict that one as well.\n\n429\n00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.790\nNow this one especially for Exchange is,\nthe only one that is actually kind of\n\n430\n00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.540\nreally neat to,\non the Exchange source URL.\n\n431\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.310\nYou can't type in the URL, but why?\n\n432\n00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.450\nAnd you can just do this.\n\n433\n00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.130\nUse auto discover.\n\n434\n00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.080\nYour DNS records are set up,\nyou're off and you're ready to go.\n\n435\n00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.250\nUsing this just makes it so\n\n436\n00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.710\nmuch easier because it was simply do\nthe AutoDiscover for us, ready to go.\n\n437\n00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nit eliminates human error, right?\n\n438\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.900\nNo typos in my name and then,\nwhy isn't this working?\n\n439\n00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.330\nWhy can't it find my Exchange Server?\n\n440\n00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.616\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nFrom that point,\n\n441\n00:23:33.616 --> 00:23:35.785\nI'm gonna leave the query transform here.\n\n442\n00:23:35.785 --> 00:23:39.790\nCuz I'm not gonna worry about\nincluding anything right now,\n\n443\n00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.340\nto limit my particular scope of things.\n\n444\n00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.470\nLet me turn off that auto complete.\n\n445\n00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:48.200\nAnd the only odd thing is,\nright behind my head there,\n\n446\n00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.966\nis a button there that says, Save.\n\n447\n00:23:50.966 --> 00:23:56.273\nAnd once we have that now at this point,\nwe will see there it is,\n\n448\n00:23:56.273 --> 00:24:01.998\ndefined for this particular site\ncollection The eDiscovery here.\n\n449\n00:24:01.998 --> 00:24:04.280\nAnd this one is now active.\n\n450\n00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.423\nSo the great thing is now that we\ngot the site collections setup,\n\n451\n00:24:08.423 --> 00:24:12.721\nwe now have also said,\nhere's where the source of that eDiscovery\n\n452\n00:24:12.721 --> 00:24:18.130\ninformation is going to come from as well\nand that's what we want to do, okay?\n\n453\n00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.020\nWe still got [INAUDIBLE]\nset up a little bit more,\n\n454\n00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.890\nbut overall though that was at\nleast some of the basics here.\n\n455\n00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.500\n&gt;&gt; And it looks like SharePoint might give\nus some sources already out of the box?\n\n456\n00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.290\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; A template.\n\n457\n00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does give you that idea of\nthe different templates that you also have\n\n458\n00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.070\nprovided if you want to.\n\n459\n00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:38.070\nSo it can give you those because\nthere already expecting just for\n\n460\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.560\nregular searching,\nnot just for eDiscovery.\n\n461\n00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.950\nThat this is more than likely what\nyou're gonna look for anyways.\n\n462\n00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.040\nAnd that's true, right?\n\n463\n00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.170\nI don't know of a time when I\nwouldn't be looking for documents.\n\n464\n00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.010\nBut conversations,\nI probably wouldn't have thought about.\n\n465\n00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.297\nIt's great that they've set that up for\nme to not have to worry about it.\n\n466\n00:24:54.297 --> 00:24:57.600\nLocal people searches, matching tags here.\n\n467\n00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.115\nStuff that I wouldn't think about that now\nit appears in a nice drop down menu, and\n\n468\n00:25:02.115 --> 00:25:05.300\nthat gives me that ability\nto be able to do that.\n\n469\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.940\nSo remember that as we start\nthis entire process, right?\n\n470\n00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:16.590\nWe got kind of the basic infrastructure\nthat we need set up and ready to go now.\n\n471\n00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.670\nBut, the thing that we don't\nhave is that we don't have any\n\n472\n00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.380\nrights to do anything with it yet.\n\n473\n00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.630\nSo, it means that we have to go now and\nbegin to say, all right,\n\n474\n00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.290\nwho's gonna be in charge of this?\n\n475\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.010\nHow is this going to run in permissions?\n\n476\n00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.140\nAnd how we're gonna get this to happen?\n\n477\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.790\nAnd that's a lot more for\n\n478\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:41.410\nus to actually deal with than what we have\ntime for in the remainder of this episode.\n\n479\n00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.610\nSo we're actually, probably gonna\nhave to move into a part three.\n\n480\n00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.470\nI know Mike's surprised that I\nwould end up doing a part three.\n\n481\n00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.790\nBut overall though [LAUGH] he's\nlaughing like crazy, are you joking me?\n\n482\n00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.400\nThat's a norm-\n&gt;&gt; Can you see the shocked look\n\n483\n00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.655\non my face, right now?\n\n484\n00:25:53.655 --> 00:25:54.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Really?\n\n485\n00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.730\n&gt;&gt; No way.\n&gt;&gt; Is that possible?\n\n486\n00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.180\n&gt;&gt; No, we love it Ronnie,\n\n487\n00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.240\ncuz you've got all this information that\nyou're sharing with us, fantastic stuff.\n\n488\n00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.530\nSo, so far we've seen why\nwe'd want to do eDiscovery.\n\n489\n00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.440\nWhat it is, why we would want to do it?\n\n490\n00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.090\nAnd we've created the site\ncollections to support it.\n\n491\n00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.770\nWe've now set up the source, right?\n\n492\n00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:16.880\nWhere are we gonna pull the information\nfrom that we need to do the eDiscovery on.\n\n493\n00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.490\nBut as Ronnie said\nthere's a lot more to it.\n\n494\n00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.140\nWe still got to work on permissions.\n\n495\n00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.491\nI'm assuming Ronnie, both permissions\nto one to reach out to Exchange,\n\n496\n00:26:23.491 --> 00:26:26.635\nand gather all those emails from\nall these different users, right?\n\n497\n00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:29.450\nWe're gonna be reaching into\nmultiple user's emails.\n\n498\n00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.650\nSo who has permission to do that?\n\n499\n00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.240\nAnd then once that\ninformation is gathered,\n\n500\n00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.275\nwe probably need to control\nwho can access that.\n\n501\n00:26:36.275 --> 00:26:38.340\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I just can't have just Joe Anybody\n\n502\n00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.250\nreading through everybody's emails,\nor accessing that information.\n\n503\n00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.710\nSo we've got a lot more to do\nto configure the eDiscovery.\n\n504\n00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.010\nSo we appreciate you hanging\nout with us Ronnie, and\n\n505\n00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.680\nshowing those great demonstrations,\nand coming back for part three.\n\n506\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.000\nSo that we can continue on\nwith setting up eDiscovery.\n\n507\n00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.370\nBut for now we are out of time.\n\n508\n00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:58.620\nSo signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n509\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.370\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n510\n00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.671\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n511\n00:27:01.671 --> 00:27:08.436\n[MUSIC]\n\n512\n00:27:08.436 --> 00:27:14.800\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

00:00:09.554\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:12.205\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:15.435\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:17.430\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\n\n7\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.928\ntoday we're doing our\nenabling Office 365 Services.\n\n8\n00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:25.455\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're configuring eDiscovery.\n\n9\n00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:28.870\nNow this is a part 3, so if you missed\npart 1 and part 2 make sure you go back\n\n10\n00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.248\nand check those out first cuz we've\nalready done a lot of the ground work.\n\n11\n00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:36.973\nWe talked about why we needed eDiscovery,\nWe've got it kind of set up, right, we've\n\n12\n00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:41.265\ncreated a site to support our eDiscovery,\nor site collection, I should say.\n\n13\n00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:44.671\nBut now we're gonna go back and do some\nmore configuration and get it ready to go.\n\n14\n00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.590\nAnd here to help us out with that of\ncourse, is the master Ronnie Wong.\n\n15\n00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.760\nWelcome back Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.570\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n17\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.450\nas we continue on to take a look at this\nvery important topic of eDiscovery, and\n\n18\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.190\nmaking sure that we're configuring it to\nwork the way that need to for Office 365.\n\n19\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.030\nAs we do so, we've already set up, like\nwe said, the different site collections.\n\n20\n00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.892\nWe even showed you last time how to\nset up the source where that data's\n\n21\n00:01:09.892 --> 00:01:13.356\ngonna come from, so\nwe can population the information inside\n\n22\n00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:16.035\nthose SharePoint sites in\na way that we need to.\n\n23\n00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:19.983\nBut now we've got this issue that\nwe really need to take care of.\n\n24\n00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:24.250\nWhich is now that we've got that set up,\nwell, who's gonna be issuing the commands?\n\n25\n00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.225\nWho's actually going to be doing these\nthings that we need to gather all that\n\n26\n00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:29.167\ninformation in?\n\n27\n00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:32.910\nAnd that comes down to now adding,\nessentially, users.\n\n28\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.330\nThat really have the permissions that they\nneed to be able to run the actual search.\n\n29\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.715\nTo be able to do all\nthe stuff that we need to do.\n\n30\n00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:43.887\nThere's a couple of different\nways that you and I can do this.\n\n31\n00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:46.030\nAnd it's something that we\ndefinitely need to know.\n\n32\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.273\nAnd then we're gonna talk about\nthe best practice of doing this.\n\n33\n00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:53.310\nSo when we set up from our last episode.\n\n34\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.361\nWe had only really\nconfigured one source for\n\n35\n00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:00.000\nthe results that we want\nwhich was Exchange Online.\n\n36\n00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.621\nAnd we did tell you that you can\ngo of course and set this up for\n\n37\n00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:06.980\nSharePoint as well as for\nOneDrive for Business.\n\n38\n00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.230\nAnd getting all those different\nservices where it can search throughout\n\n39\n00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.400\neverything that we need to and\nthroughout our entire tenancy.\n\n40\n00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.290\nAnd that way we can get everything we want\nto, and you just set it up for one and\n\n41\n00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.935\nif you want to you set it up for\nthe reminder.\n\n42\n00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:23.330\nBut, remember that when we start to\ndo this and we start to not assign to\n\n43\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.520\ndifferent permission or users to do this,\nwe wanna be smart about it as well.\n\n44\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.000\nAnd that's why we wanna\ntake a look at this,\n\n45\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.855\nand I'm gonna see if Mike can figure\nout what I'm trying to get to.\n\n46\n00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:35.099\nAnd Mike's probably like,\nwhat is he talking about here?\n\n47\n00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.941\nBut this way I'm hoping,\nit's a little bit of mystery, but\n\n48\n00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:41.130\nI'm hoping that you'll also\nsee the logic behind this.\n\n49\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.010\nSo, let's show you how to do this,\ninside the web UI, and then,\n\n50\n00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.490\nwe're gonna go back and\n\n51\n00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.700\nreally do it inside the Power Shell, cuz\nthat's where they test heavily on as well.\n\n52\n00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.770\nBut you at least need to know both\nthey call them out both on the exam.\n\n53\n00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.573\nBut it is heavily tested in PowerShell.\n\n54\n00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:56.330\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n55\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.907\nI am logged in as the site or\nactually the tenant administrator\n\n56\n00:03:00.907 --> 00:03:04.260\nessentially which is\nJoey Fatone over here.\n\n57\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.739\nThen I'm going to click on admin and\n\n58\n00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.735\nthe first thing that I am going to do\nnow that I have the sites ready to go.\n\n59\n00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:16.421\nIs I'm going to create a security\ngroup is what I'm going to do.\n\n60\n00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:21.580\nNow that means that we're leaving that\nSharePoint realm for just a moment.\n\n61\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.698\nBecause something in eDiscovery,\nthe way they've got this setup,\n\n62\n00:03:25.698 --> 00:03:29.819\nis that the people that are managing\nthe collection sites to do this.\n\n63\n00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.230\nThere's only one or two possibilities,\nyou can use individual users, okay.\n\n64\n00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.092\nSo a single user, they can be the ones\nthat are the administrators and\n\n65\n00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:40.497\nof course the owners to a particular site.\n\n66\n00:03:40.497 --> 00:03:42.413\nThat means they can do\nanything that they want to and\n\n67\n00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:45.690\nif it's eDiscovery site it means they\ncan do everything that they want.\n\n68\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.047\nBut the other thing that can happen\nthough is that we can set up\n\n69\n00:03:50.047 --> 00:03:52.023\na security group instead.\n\n70\n00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:55.966\nAnd that way,\nwhoever we assign to that security group,\n\n71\n00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:59.180\ncan also have those permissions as well.\n\n72\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.600\nNow Mike, why would it,\n\n73\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.730\ncuz Mike's an Active Directory expert\nhere, that's I'm testing him out on this.\n\n74\n00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.510\nMike why is it better to create\na group instead of just saying,\n\n75\n00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.228\nwhy don't we put Joey on everything?\n\n76\n00:04:11.228 --> 00:04:14.421\n&gt;&gt; One of the problems that you're\ngonna run into if you assign it to\n\n77\n00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.510\nan individual user is,\nwhen it comes time to change, right?\n\n78\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.390\nWhat if that person no longer\nneeds those permissions or right?\n\n79\n00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.240\nI've gotta manually undo all of that.\n\n80\n00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.200\nWhereas if I use a group to\nassign the permissions to,\n\n81\n00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.150\neven if it's just one person,\nI can now put that one person in there.\n\n82\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.670\nBecause tomorrow, a month from now,\na year from now, you might have two or\n\n83\n00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.300\nthree people that need those provisions or\nten people and\n\n84\n00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.880\nI don't have to give\nan assignment to each one.\n\n85\n00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.350\nI can simply add them to the group and\nwe're good to go.\n\n86\n00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.955\nAnd if Joey leaves the organization or\nchanges roles and\n\n87\n00:04:42.955 --> 00:04:47.263\nno longer should have access to\nthat eDiscovery site collection.\n\n88\n00:04:47.263 --> 00:04:50.200\nThen I can just pull him out of the group\nand he no longer has those permissions.\n\n89\n00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.946\nI don't have to go back and double\ncheck and undo access control lists and\n\n90\n00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:53.677\nthings like that.\n\n91\n00:04:53.677 --> 00:04:59.190\nSo groups really help simplify\nadministration and permissions.\n\n92\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.230\n&gt;&gt; And that is absolutely the gold\nstar answer that we were looking for.\n\n93\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.899\nThe very fact is we can\nindividually assign every user\n\n94\n00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:07.570\nthat we want to be able to do this.\n\n95\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.333\nBut now if it does change,\nit also means exactly what Mike said,\n\n96\n00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:15.610\nI'd have to go back in every place\nthat I assigned him and remove him.\n\n97\n00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.870\nWell instead, assigning it to a group,\nthen we can just remove\n\n98\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.530\nusers from the group,\nit's not really such a big deal anymore.\n\n99\n00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.034\nIt makes it administratively easier And\n\n100\n00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:29.672\none of the key points in managing\neDiscovery is that the owners which we're\n\n101\n00:05:29.672 --> 00:05:34.395\ngonna assign as far as permissions over\nthat site that we have to do this for.\n\n102\n00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:37.197\nIs gonna be those eDiscovery\nmanagers that we're gonna create.\n\n103\n00:05:37.197 --> 00:05:39.672\nBut we wanna actually\ncreate that group but\n\n104\n00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:43.560\nthey also have to be mail\nenabled type of security groups.\n\n105\n00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.083\nSo it's not just that we can create\njust any group that we want to.\n\n106\n00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:49.791\nIt's not a Yammer group,\nit's not a distribution group,\n\n107\n00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:54.355\nit is a security group and\nthat is a key point that we want to make.\n\n108\n00:05:54.355 --> 00:05:58.861\nIf is not a mail enabled group,\nnow when I say that right, M-A-I-L.\n\n109\n00:05:58.861 --> 00:06:02.120\nI know that sounds weird but\nyou know people go,\n\n110\n00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.110\nwhy does it have to be a mail, why,\nso an email enabled group here.\n\n111\n00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.490\nAnd Mike laughs at me, but the questions\nthat we have heard over time.\n\n112\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.280\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n113\n00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.229\n&gt;&gt; And you're just shaking your head.\n\n114\n00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.278\nAnd they're like,\nwhy are you shaking your head?\n\n115\n00:06:15.278 --> 00:06:18.220\nIt's no, email.\n\n116\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.130\nI should have said email, you're right.\n\n117\n00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.540\nI should have said email not mail enabled.\n\n118\n00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.410\nBut that's what we're\nnormally talking about here.\n\n119\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.110\nSo, the only way for\nus to create that of course,\n\n120\n00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.880\nis gonna be an exchange,\nis what we're going to do.\n\n121\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.870\nSo let's take a look at how\nwe do that in a web UI,\n\n122\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.000\nthen we'll switch on over into\nthe PowerShell to help us out.\n\n123\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.347\nSo here I am at the Admin Center,\nsince I clicked on the admin tile.\n\n124\n00:06:39.347 --> 00:06:43.506\nI'm going to scroll down here to the lower\nleft hand corner, I'm going to look for\n\n125\n00:06:43.506 --> 00:06:47.320\nthat little tiny admin center tile\nas well that you're gonna see.\n\n126\n00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.250\nRemember that my screen\nthe resolution is set really low so\n\n127\n00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.770\nthat you don't have to squint to\nsee what I'm clicking on here.\n\n128\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.907\nSo that way we can actually\nsee what we're looking for.\n\n129\n00:06:56.907 --> 00:07:04.000\nSelect then if I can say that under\nAdmin Centers Exchange is where I'm going.\n\n130\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.947\nSo inside of Exchange once we're here\nwe are gonna see a ton of options and\n\n131\n00:07:09.947 --> 00:07:15.522\nyou can see why Exchange is such a big,\ngigantic product in itself.\n\n132\n00:07:15.522 --> 00:07:20.752\nIt's less intimidating in the web ui then\nit is from the PowerShell perspective But\n\n133\n00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:24.500\nwe're not really focusing in\non every detail of Exchange.\n\n134\n00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.085\nIf you do,\n\n135\n00:07:25.085 --> 00:07:29.313\nmake sure you check out our exchange\nshowed that we did with Brian Swidergal.\n\n136\n00:07:29.313 --> 00:07:34.290\nThat man is a whiz at Exchange, and he'll\nshow you every single PowerShell command.\n\n137\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.770\nI think you can absolutely\nrun in Exchange.\n\n138\n00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.799\nThat man did a lot.\n\n139\n00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:42.900\nSo over here on the left-hand side,\nwe're gonna begin with this navigation.\n\n140\n00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.609\nRemember to make sure you go in and\n\n141\n00:07:44.609 --> 00:07:47.542\nexperience even if you're\ngetting ready for that exam,\n\n142\n00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:51.535\nif you don't have any experience at all,\nyou've got to start at least here.\n\n143\n00:07:51.535 --> 00:07:55.834\nWe wanna get inside a recipients,\nand now notice, of course,\n\n144\n00:07:55.834 --> 00:07:58.770\nyou have different options that you have.\n\n145\n00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.715\nMailboxes is usually the basic unit,\nright, where we can send and\n\n146\n00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:03.950\nreceive emails.\n\n147\n00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.080\nAnd then we have groups, which is what\nwe're going to get access to resources,\n\n148\n00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.410\ncontacts, shared, and migration.\n\n149\n00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.680\nThis is set up so that if you are\nmigrating you're ready to get in there.\n\n150\n00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.970\nIt's got everything that we need.\n\n151\n00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.409\nBut what we're going to set up right\nhere is going to be the groups.\n\n152\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.790\nSo once I select Groups at this point,\n\n153\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.260\nnow I'm gonna end up in\na moment here creating a group.\n\n154\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.000\nAnd you can see where I've\nalready created one as a,\n\n155\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.440\nmaking sure that everything\nended up working here.\n\n156\n00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.470\nSo here is the security group,\n\n157\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.510\nlet's go ahead we'll kind of just get\nrid of this one so that we'll do it\n\n158\n00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.710\nfrom scratch here, make sure that\neverything is working the same way.\n\n159\n00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.910\nIf it ever finishes updating,\nwe'll be fine.\n\n160\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:46.960\nBut that's what we're going to do.\n\n161\n00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.380\nWe're going to create this\nnew security group, and\n\n162\n00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.260\nonce we create the new security group,\nwe also need to add in members.\n\n163\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.540\nThe great thing is in the web UI,\nit allows us to do it all in one place,\n\n164\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.070\nwhich is kind of neat.\n\n165\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.370\nSo the way that we create a new\ngroup is we click on the new,\n\n166\n00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.030\nwhich is the plus sign and now,\nwe have this chance to actually see\n\n167\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.590\nsome of the different groups\nthat we have available.\n\n168\n00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:17.030\nYou definitely need to know which group\nyou would pick in e-discovery to do this.\n\n169\n00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.360\nIf you choose this one, you're wrong.\n\n170\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.040\nOkay?\n\n171\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.860\nIf you choose this one,\nyou're gonna be wrong.\n\n172\n00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.640\nThe dynamic distribution group,\nyou're still wrong.\n\n173\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.970\nThat's why I wanted to emphasis\nthis as you're going, no,\n\n174\n00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.880\nthere's not that many groups,\nthere's more than you'd think.\n\n175\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.540\nSo if you need to create\none remember that this\n\n176\n00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.120\nis the weird thing about the exams, right?\n\n177\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.580\nIt's not that they don't test you\non things that are relevant but\n\n178\n00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.820\nif you don't pick the right group,\nit doesn't work.\n\n179\n00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.540\nThey do test you on stuff like this where\nit's saying which of the following groups\n\n180\n00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.270\nwould you create to actually be\nable to manage e discovery here.\n\n181\n00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:56.600\nWell, you've gotta know which one or\nit's not going to work correctly for you.\n\n182\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.526\nSo you are going to select\nthen the security group.\n\n183\n00:10:01.526 --> 00:10:05.473\nAnd once I do, you'll see it actually\nbrings up this nice dialog box.\n\n184\n00:10:05.473 --> 00:10:09.585\nNotice here's the proper\nterminology again,\n\n185\n00:10:09.585 --> 00:10:13.707\njust in case, mail-enabled security group.\n\n186\n00:10:13.707 --> 00:10:17.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know it's so strange but I've heard\n\n187\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.940\nit more than once here, so there we go, so\nnow we'll go ahead and do our e discovery.\n\n188\n00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.450\nAnd I'm gonna do MGR here\njust as we did before.\n\n189\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:34.740\nLet's see, it says value can't\nbe duplicated there, or empty.\n\n190\n00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.030\nNow an alias, I'm just gonna do the same\nthing, just the same alias again.\n\n191\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:44.920\nI should do MGR, manager's I'll probably\nmess that up at some point in the future.\n\n192\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.420\nSo there we go.\n\n193\n00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:53.610\nNow, once I have that group,\nI can also of course create an owner.\n\n194\n00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.510\nBut notice it realizes who created\nthe group which is me right here and\n\n195\n00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.380\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n196\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.550\nBut at this point, let see if I\nscroll down, a little bit more.\n\n197\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.540\nThat's what we want to get to.\n\n198\n00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:12.010\nIf I am doing this quickly such as I\nmight see this someplace and just think,\n\n199\n00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.890\nyou hate to say it like, everything else\nwe do is just click, click, click, click.\n\n200\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.930\nWe get click happy and\nwe don't think about this,\n\n201\n00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:22.120\nwe may just scroll right down through\nhere and click save and when I do that,\n\n202\n00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:28.620\nMike, what happens if I don't actually\nhave any members in that group and\n\n203\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.290\nI start assigning them to things?\n\n204\n00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.305\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna work out to well for\nyou, is it?\n\n205\n00:11:32.305 --> 00:11:33.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, and\n\n206\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.120\nthat is another point we want to make.\n\n207\n00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.970\nThe very fact that you create a group\ndoesn't necessarily mean that, what?\n\n208\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.690\nMembers are automatically assigned to it.\n\n209\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:46.580\nSo, you do need to make sure that\nyou fill out every part of this,\n\n210\n00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.500\nto make it effective in the way\nthat you want it to as well, okay?\n\n211\n00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.060\nAlso, at the end here,\nnotice it says owner approval is required.\n\n212\n00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.250\nSo this is where you would do it.\n\n213\n00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.850\nYou would simply click add,\nand once you click add,\n\n214\n00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.920\nit should bring up the list of\npeople inside of your organization.\n\n215\n00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.360\nAnd then you can select that one,\nclick add, click ok,\n\n216\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.490\nand that adds in your\nmember at least one member.\n\n217\n00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.310\nYou wanna add yourself in there\nmake sure you add yourself in there\n\n218\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.440\nto make sure that it's all done.\n\n219\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.350\nBut notice that we can also do this.\n\n220\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.230\nChoose whether the owner approval\nis required to join the group.\n\n221\n00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:25.160\nNote that only owners can remove members.\n\n222\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.330\nNow that's also another key for us too.\n\n223\n00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.120\nIt is not necessarily just\nthe person that says,\n\n224\n00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.260\nI just wanna remove him from the group.\n\n225\n00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.060\nIt has to be the owner of\nthe group that removes them.\n\n226\n00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.130\nSo you can require this too.\n\n227\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.740\nSo just kind of be aware.\n\n228\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.820\nNow, that's pretty much the set\nup from the web UI side and\n\n229\n00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.970\nthat seems easy enough.\n\n230\n00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.800\nSeems intuitive, make sure that\neverything actually ends up working.\n\n231\n00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.470\nThat is at least the beginning, we now\nhave a security group and then we're gonna\n\n232\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.710\ntake that security group and we're gonna\nassign them to those site collections and\n\n233\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.730\nto whatever else that we need to.\n\n234\n00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.570\nBut we want to begin right there.\n\n235\n00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.369\nNow I'm not gonna create it right here,\nand\n\n236\n00:13:04.369 --> 00:13:08.606\nthe reason why is that as nice as it is,\nas much work as Microsoft and\n\n237\n00:13:08.606 --> 00:13:11.802\nthe Exchange team have\nput into developing this.\n\n238\n00:13:11.802 --> 00:13:14.347\n&gt;&gt; And as much as Ronnie would\nlike to skip the next part.\n\n239\n00:13:14.347 --> 00:13:15.703\n&gt;&gt; I would, I really would.\n\n240\n00:13:15.703 --> 00:13:17.084\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n241\n00:13:17.084 --> 00:13:22.410\nwe've gotta remember that on the exam\nthey test heavily on the PowerShell.\n\n242\n00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:22.940\nAnd Mike,\n\n243\n00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.670\nI think I shared this with you too,\nis that I was talking to Bryan about this.\n\n244\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.080\nThat the very fact is\n\n245\n00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:36.110\nMicrosoft essentially they love\nthe PowerShell test because there is no\n\n246\n00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:41.130\nThere's no guessing on how you arrived\nat how you got the right answer.\n\n247\n00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.830\n&gt;&gt; Not a lot of ambiguity,\nlike in the GUI,\n\n248\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.538\na lot of times there's more than\none way to get to the same place.\n\n249\n00:13:45.538 --> 00:13:48.222\nBut with Powershell, you either\nknow the command or you don't, and\n\n250\n00:13:48.222 --> 00:13:51.170\nit's either gonna work or it's not,\nso it's pretty straight forward.\n\n251\n00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's what he said.\n\n252\n00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.970\nHe said the testing is fairly\nsimple on the syntax, right?\n\n253\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.000\nEither the syntax is 100% right or\nit doesn't work.\n\n254\n00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.490\nSo that's why they like testing on it.\n\n255\n00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:04.560\nAs many different theories that\nI've heard about why they use that,\n\n256\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.980\nthat is the most logical\ntesting theory that there is.\n\n257\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.790\nThey're saying it's easier to test on and\nthat makes a lot of sense.\n\n258\n00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:16.010\nThey're not so much concerned that you\nknow how to actually get around in it.\n\n259\n00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.590\nThey just wanna know,\ndo you actually know the command to do so.\n\n260\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.522\nSo you gotta spend time in\nboth if you're doing this.\n\n261\n00:14:21.522 --> 00:14:25.680\nThis is probably the way that I\nwould do it, 100% is the web UI.\n\n262\n00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.748\nBut the very fact is if you love\nPowerShell, and there are people out there\n\n263\n00:14:29.748 --> 00:14:33.870\nthat love it to no end, this is what\nyou would actually end up doing.\n\n264\n00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.100\nSo I'm gonna bring up\nthe PowerShell Command here.\n\n265\n00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:42.300\nI wanna make sure that I am still\nconnected to Exchange Online.\n\n266\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.740\nNow if I'm not,\nI definitely will need to be connected.\n\n267\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.990\nSo here's where we saw that and\nthis does happen.\n\n268\n00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.760\nSo if you're like me you might\nthink I'll just make the connection\n\n269\n00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.660\none time during the day.\n\n270\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.450\nNo big deal, and\nyou start running these commands remotely,\n\n271\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.220\nand then you realize,\nit's not accepting it.\n\n272\n00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.550\nWell, run that Git PS Session, and\nthen figure out is the state broken.\n\n273\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.770\nIf it is, it doesn't matter how\noften you run those commands.\n\n274\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.540\nIt's just not going to work.\n\n275\n00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.430\nSo that's why we might\nhave to actually run and\n\n276\n00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.990\nmake that connection\nagain in due exchange.\n\n277\n00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.950\nUnless we do so, we should see this\nsecond one here that says opened.\n\n278\n00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.460\nSo as long as it's opened and\n\n279\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:26.150\nwe are ready to go, we can now create\nthe idea of the security group.\n\n280\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.080\nNow, this is where you definitely\nneed to pay attention again.\n\n281\n00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.560\nRemember what I showed you in the GUI,\n\n282\n00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.610\nthe very fact is we can create a group\nwhich is what we need to do but\n\n283\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.790\nthe hard part about this is thinking that\nonce you read the syntax out for that and\n\n284\n00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:43.040\nyou think that you're done, you gotta\nstill add a member into that group.\n\n285\n00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.110\nAnd that's where I fail in PowerShell.\n\n286\n00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.810\nI'll remember the first part.\n\n287\n00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.569\nThe second one I'll go [SOUND] let\nme just go on and not do that.\n\n288\n00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:55.076\nSo in an answer like this, especially\nwhen you're getting ready for the exam,\n\n289\n00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:57.580\nthis may take two commands and\nnot just one.\n\n290\n00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.053\nAnd I can't tell you that you'll see\nthat on the exam, but I can tell you,\n\n291\n00:16:01.053 --> 00:16:04.976\nthat sounds like Microsoft where they'll\nsay, well let's see if Ronnie actually\n\n292\n00:16:04.976 --> 00:16:07.745\nremembers that you have to add\nin a member in to that group.\n\n293\n00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:12.459\nOr is he just gonna leave a blank group to\nget added in everywhere and then try and\n\n294\n00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:13.758\nfigure it out later.\n\n295\n00:16:13.758 --> 00:16:14.364\nDon't do that.\n\n296\n00:16:14.364 --> 00:16:16.012\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Make sure that you actually\n\n297\n00:16:16.012 --> 00:16:17.580\ndo both if you're going to do this.\n\n298\n00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.692\nSo from the PowerShell since\nwe are going to do this,\n\n299\n00:16:21.692 --> 00:16:24.598\nI am going to go ahead and select New.\n\n300\n00:16:24.598 --> 00:16:26.859\nAnd then this one,\nit's gonna be a distribution group.\n\n301\n00:16:26.859 --> 00:16:29.937\nNow I say that, let me see,\nis there a security group?\n\n302\n00:16:29.937 --> 00:16:30.669\nThat's why.\n\n303\n00:16:30.669 --> 00:16:35.642\nI was just trying to make sure as I read\nmy own command I thought maybe I added in\n\n304\n00:16:35.642 --> 00:16:39.559\nthe wrong one, but\nIt is gonna be a new distribution group.\n\n305\n00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:43.707\nAnd you'll see why here in a moment, why\nwe'll actually add in the type at the end\n\n306\n00:16:43.707 --> 00:16:46.148\nhere, which is called a security group,\ntoo.\n\n307\n00:16:46.148 --> 00:16:51.597\nNow that I have that, I now need to add\nin a name for this new security group.\n\n308\n00:16:51.597 --> 00:16:55.930\nSo I'm going to type in Name, and the name\nneeds to go inside of quotation marks.\n\n309\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.123\nI don't know if that is actually\nbig enough for us to see,\n\n310\n00:16:58.123 --> 00:16:59.689\nhopefully that's a little bit better.\n\n311\n00:16:59.689 --> 00:17:05.513\nSo inside of quotes I'm gonna\ncall it ediscovery mgr is here,\n\n312\n00:17:05.513 --> 00:17:07.978\njust like I had in the GUI.\n\n313\n00:17:07.978 --> 00:17:11.551\n&gt;&gt; Remember we can reuse that name\ncuz he didn't actually click Save and\n\n314\n00:17:11.551 --> 00:17:14.151\ncancelled it, so\nthat group doesn't exist yet.\n\n315\n00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:16.346\nYeah, if I tried to do this with\nthe group exists, I don't know what,\n\n316\n00:17:16.346 --> 00:17:17.366\nI don't think they'd love me.\n\n317\n00:17:17.366 --> 00:17:20.398\n[CROSSTALK] They'd probably say yeah\nyou're not gonna be able to do this.\n\n318\n00:17:20.398 --> 00:17:23.790\nThe other thing of course is\nto also allow for an alias.\n\n319\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.188\nAnd this is nice.\n\n320\n00:17:25.188 --> 00:17:28.518\nIf you can abbreviate this and\nshorten it up,\n\n321\n00:17:28.518 --> 00:17:32.471\nyour typing in PowerShell becomes very,\nvery good.\n\n322\n00:17:32.471 --> 00:17:37.418\nFor me I wasn't creative and I just simply\nsaid I don't know how to actually shorten\n\n323\n00:17:37.418 --> 00:17:38.981\nthis up, so what did I do?\n\n324\n00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:42.012\nI just went ahead and said,\nlet me just make the alias the same thing.\n\n325\n00:17:42.012 --> 00:17:45.228\nAnd I was thinking, that would\nactually be easier for most people.\n\n326\n00:17:45.228 --> 00:17:49.173\nIt doesn't have to be identical, if you\nknow of an abbreviation that will work for\n\n327\n00:17:49.173 --> 00:17:51.359\nyou and you can remember it,\nthat is the key.\n\n328\n00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:55.079\nIf you're like me, you're not\ngonna remember the abbreviation,\n\n329\n00:17:55.079 --> 00:17:58.356\nthen the alias of being the same\nis also gonna be fine, too.\n\n330\n00:17:58.356 --> 00:18:02.315\nLastly then, we need type.\n\n331\n00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:06.941\nNow, the other thing of course that I\nrecommend that you're probably not going\n\n332\n00:18:06.941 --> 00:18:09.839\nto have to worry about when\nthe exam comes along and\n\n333\n00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:12.618\nprobably not gonna be able\nuse is tab auto fill?\n\n334\n00:18:12.618 --> 00:18:13.979\nIt helps out with typos.\n\n335\n00:18:13.979 --> 00:18:18.098\nAnd if anybody makes typos on\nthe ITProTV team on a show,\n\n336\n00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:20.738\nit's gonna be this guy right here.\n\n337\n00:18:20.738 --> 00:18:27.509\nSo using that tab fill is absolutely one\nof the essential things that I recommend.\n\n338\n00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:32.199\nAnd at least, if there is something case\nsensitive, it's gonna fix it for you.\n\n339\n00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:34.179\nJust kind of make sure you do that.\n\n340\n00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:39.223\nAnd this is where, even though it says new\ndistribution group here at the beginning,\n\n341\n00:18:39.223 --> 00:18:40.917\nwe simply type in Security.\n\n342\n00:18:40.917 --> 00:18:43.470\nLet me zoom out so\nthat we can see the whole thing,\n\n343\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.411\nmake sure I actually have\neverything that I want there.\n\n344\n00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:50.563\nFrom that point it tells me it's\ncreating it, and now it's asking me.\n\n345\n00:18:50.563 --> 00:18:55.959\nLet's see, I need to check on who I\nsigned in as, and this says Joey.\n\n346\n00:18:55.959 --> 00:19:00.078\nSo it's asking me for\na credentials to be able to do this.\n\n347\n00:19:00.078 --> 00:19:04.444\nAnd here is,\nif I can get it right, is the key.\n\n348\n00:19:08.766 --> 00:19:12.433\nOops, let me see, my mouse sometimes\nlocks up on the screen here.\n\n349\n00:19:14.259 --> 00:19:16.485\nSo this is where I'll have to take a look.\n\n350\n00:19:16.485 --> 00:19:19.796\nSo apparently, let's see, did I?\n\n351\n00:19:19.796 --> 00:19:25.894\nAnd time failed following server access.\n\n352\n00:19:25.894 --> 00:19:32.850\n&gt;&gt; No session with this implicit-\n&gt;&gt; Let me see here.\n\n353\n00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.080\nIt's stuck.\n\n354\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:40.769\nSession has been associated\nwith this implicit something.\n\n355\n00:19:43.936 --> 00:19:46.782\nAll right, let me make sure I typed\nin everything correctly here.\n\n356\n00:19:48.777 --> 00:19:55.846\nNew distribution group, E Discovery\nManagers, alias and type of security.\n\n357\n00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:57.840\nIt asks me for their credentials.\n\n358\n00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.923\nSo I'm assuming that at this\npoint it is a typo, but\n\n359\n00:20:00.923 --> 00:20:03.378\nI would think I'd get an access denied.\n\n360\n00:20:03.378 --> 00:20:05.347\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe a typo in the password.\n\n361\n00:20:05.347 --> 00:20:07.520\n&gt;&gt; Yep, let's try this out again.\n\n362\n00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:14.003\n[LAUGH] I told you, if anybody can make\na typo on the show it's gonna be me.\n\n363\n00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:21.380\nAnd, there we go, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.657\nSo it was just simply a typo, which is\na good thing for me to actually know.\n\n365\n00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:29.055\nAnd you can tell now, so\nit says it's creating a new session for\n\n366\n00:20:29.055 --> 00:20:32.598\nthe implicit remoting of\nthe New-DistributionGroup command.\n\n367\n00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:34.169\nLet's see, anything else?\n\n368\n00:20:34.169 --> 00:20:37.742\nNew office groups are the next\ngeneration of distribution list.\n\n369\n00:20:37.742 --> 00:20:40.047\nGroups give teams shared tools.\n\n370\n00:20:40.047 --> 00:20:43.947\nNow it says you can start using\nthem right away if you choose to.\n\n371\n00:20:43.947 --> 00:20:48.003\nSo it's already saying hey look,\nthere's a new command that you should\n\n372\n00:20:48.003 --> 00:20:52.008\nbe using right now, cuz things\nare beginning to change in PowerShell.\n\n373\n00:20:52.008 --> 00:20:54.406\nBut the key here is at the end.\n\n374\n00:20:54.406 --> 00:20:58.289\nWhat we're looking at right down here,\nwhere it says what I've created, right?\n\n375\n00:20:58.289 --> 00:21:02.447\nSo there it is, there's the name,\nthere's a display name, the group type,\n\n376\n00:21:02.447 --> 00:21:04.727\nsecurity enabled, which is what we want.\n\n377\n00:21:04.727 --> 00:21:05.673\nAnd there it is,\n\n378\n00:21:05.673 --> 00:21:10.548\nthere's that mail-enabled group that we\nwanted to create at the beginning, okay?\n\n379\n00:21:10.548 --> 00:21:13.028\nSo once I have that,\nI'm not done yet, right Mike?\n\n380\n00:21:13.028 --> 00:21:13.842\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n381\n00:21:13.842 --> 00:21:18.279\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if I finish now, if this is\nwhat I do, I'm gonna be wrong, okay?\n\n382\n00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:23.623\nBecause now I have a security group with\nno users in it, that's always a bad thing.\n\n383\n00:21:23.623 --> 00:21:25.846\nSo make sure you remember this, too.\n\n384\n00:21:25.846 --> 00:21:29.688\nNow, of course, now that we have\nthe new distribution group,\n\n385\n00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:33.940\nwe now need to add a member into\nthis new distribution group.\n\n386\n00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:39.828\nSo this is where we type in add,\nDistribution group member.\n\n387\n00:21:39.828 --> 00:21:42.831\nNow, MIke, you remember this\ncommand [CROSSTALK] don't you?\n\n388\n00:21:42.831 --> 00:21:43.653\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n389\n00:21:43.653 --> 00:21:46.699\n&gt;&gt; That's where the autofill\nreally does help us out.\n\n390\n00:21:46.699 --> 00:21:49.487\nSo I would never remember\nthis command except for\n\n391\n00:21:49.487 --> 00:21:52.078\nthe very fact that auto\ndistribution group.\n\n392\n00:21:52.078 --> 00:21:55.866\nI might remember auto distribution member,\nor add,\n\n393\n00:21:55.866 --> 00:22:01.859\nexcuse me distribution member, but the add\ndistribution group member I might not.\n\n394\n00:22:01.859 --> 00:22:05.088\nFrom here I'm going to\nadd in the identity.\n\n395\n00:22:05.088 --> 00:22:09.599\nNow it's asking me well, what group\nare you actually adding this for?\n\n396\n00:22:09.599 --> 00:22:16.200\nSo inside of quotes I'm gonna\ntype in E discovery MGRs.\n\n397\n00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.809\nHopefully I've typed that incorrectly.\n\n398\n00:22:18.809 --> 00:22:19.511\nAnd then,\n\n399\n00:22:19.511 --> 00:22:24.271\nI need to tell it the member that I'm\nadding into this particular group.\n\n400\n00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:28.085\nNow, once I do this, I'm gonna select\nthe other member, the other, only person\n\n401\n00:22:28.085 --> 00:22:30.600\ninside of my entire tenancy here-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.729\n&gt;&gt; By his email address, which is going to\n\n403\n00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:42.264\nbe lance@officeprodemoco on microsoft.com.\n\n404\n00:22:42.264 --> 00:22:45.764\nOnce I've got that setup and ready to go,\n\n405\n00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:50.679\nwhat I should now be able to do\nis get that displaying here.\n\n406\n00:22:50.679 --> 00:22:54.910\nAnd now, I've added in a member\ninto the distribution group.\n\n407\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.183\nLet's see if he actually shows up,\n\n408\n00:22:58.183 --> 00:23:02.556\nI'm going to get back into the GUI,\nthe web UI.\n\n409\n00:23:02.556 --> 00:23:05.757\nAnd now let's refresh the group here for\na moment.\n\n410\n00:23:05.757 --> 00:23:08.071\nWell maybe, if I can.\n\n411\n00:23:08.071 --> 00:23:10.239\nCan I not refresh?\n\n412\n00:23:10.239 --> 00:23:11.766\nAll right, let's try it again.\n\n413\n00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:12.424\n&gt;&gt; Right down there.\n\n414\n00:23:12.424 --> 00:23:14.116\n&gt;&gt; Right there.\nSorry.\n\n415\n00:23:14.116 --> 00:23:18.310\nI'm looking right at it and\nit's still, wait, let's see.\n\n416\n00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.981\nThere it goes.\n\n417\n00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:20.389\nI was gonna say, it's not there.\n\n418\n00:23:20.389 --> 00:23:21.982\nWhy did it not show up?\n\n419\n00:23:21.982 --> 00:23:30.138\nSo it's in here, if I Edit,\nI should now see membership now.\n\n420\n00:23:30.138 --> 00:23:33.300\nIf I typed it in right,\nI should see whose name here.\n\n421\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.600\nHopefully, Lance Bance!\n\n422\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.340\nSo Lance is in here and\nwe are off and ready to go.\n\n423\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.791\nI'm going to also use this,\nand add Joey in there as well.\n\n424\n00:23:43.791 --> 00:23:46.158\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's one difference\nwe probably should point out.\n\n425\n00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:49.788\nLook when he did it through the GUI,\nthere was a check mark that was enabled by\n\n426\n00:23:49.788 --> 00:23:53.194\ndefault that said, hey whoever's\ncreating this, in your case Joey,\n\n427\n00:23:53.194 --> 00:23:55.153\ngo ahead and add yourself, basically.\n\n428\n00:23:55.153 --> 00:23:58.368\nBecause you're the one that's\nwriting that GUI to the group, and\n\n429\n00:23:58.368 --> 00:24:00.910\nthen you added Lance on\nthe bottom with PowerShell.\n\n430\n00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.127\n&gt;&gt; Nothing.\n&gt;&gt; It didn't give you that option, right?\n\n431\n00:24:02.127 --> 00:24:04.921\nIt's not as friendly, if you will.\n\n432\n00:24:04.921 --> 00:24:06.949\nYou have to specify everything.\n\n433\n00:24:06.949 --> 00:24:09.032\nSo when you created a group,\nit didn't automatically add you.\n\n434\n00:24:09.032 --> 00:24:09.754\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n435\n00:24:09.754 --> 00:24:12.744\n&gt;&gt; You could add Lance, and\nthen go back later as yourself and\n\n436\n00:24:12.744 --> 00:24:15.629\ntry to access this stuff and\ngo, why can't I access it?\n\n437\n00:24:15.629 --> 00:24:17.052\nI'm the one that created it.\n\n438\n00:24:17.052 --> 00:24:19.208\nThat's because you didn't\nadd yourself to that group.\n\n439\n00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:23.844\nIt's really strange how detailed you have\nto be if you're gonna be doing this, and\n\n440\n00:24:23.844 --> 00:24:26.837\nit's just stuff you gotta get ready for\nfor the exam.\n\n441\n00:24:26.837 --> 00:24:28.378\nThere's no other way to put it.\n\n442\n00:24:28.378 --> 00:24:32.698\nSo without you spending time both in\nthe PowerShell as well as in the web UI,\n\n443\n00:24:32.698 --> 00:24:35.588\nit's not gonna be an easy\npart of the exam for you.\n\n444\n00:24:35.588 --> 00:24:38.184\nAnd I recommend that if you're\nnot comfortable with it,\n\n445\n00:24:38.184 --> 00:24:41.874\ndon't just think I'm just gonna just\ntake my luck and chance it doing this.\n\n446\n00:24:41.874 --> 00:24:44.167\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because the majority of the exam,\n\n447\n00:24:44.167 --> 00:24:47.461\nyou're gonna find out,\nis gonna be you trying to figure out what\n\n448\n00:24:47.461 --> 00:24:51.493\nthe PowerShell commands are, and making\nsure that we can do all of that, too.\n\n449\n00:24:51.493 --> 00:24:53.899\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI like your thought about doing both.\n\n450\n00:24:53.899 --> 00:24:58.760\nFor me, I love going through the GUI\nbecause you've got the fields.\n\n451\n00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.707\nIt's showing you what\ninformation you need to provide.\n\n452\n00:25:01.707 --> 00:25:05.179\nAnd really what's happening is when you\nclick Save, it's executing PowerShell\n\n453\n00:25:05.179 --> 00:25:08.680\ncommands in the background,\nyou're just not typing them out, right?\n\n454\n00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.164\nSo now, when you go back\nto the PowerShell command,\n\n455\n00:25:11.164 --> 00:25:14.492\nI can think about that form I filled\nout in the GUI, and I think, okay,\n\n456\n00:25:14.492 --> 00:25:16.805\nthe first thing was the name,\nthen it asked me for\n\n457\n00:25:16.805 --> 00:25:20.443\nan alias, then it asked me, I had to\nclick on the type, and then my members.\n\n458\n00:25:20.443 --> 00:25:22.440\nAnd so,\nI know now when I go to PowerShell,\n\n459\n00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.839\nI'm gonna have to provide\nthat same information.\n\n460\n00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:28.754\nSo again, it kinda helps remind you what\nparameters maybe you need to go along with\n\n461\n00:25:28.754 --> 00:25:29.500\nthat command.\n\n462\n00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.960\nThere's no doubt, it's just,\nI don't know how else to emphasize that.\n\n463\n00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.660\nThe great thing is,\nmost people that are taking this exam,\n\n464\n00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.738\nthey're already familiar with PowerShell,\nthat's the key, and\n\n465\n00:25:40.738 --> 00:25:44.308\nwe're just giving them reminders and\npoints, as they get ready for the exam.\n\n466\n00:25:44.308 --> 00:25:49.409\nBut if you're brand new and go I'd love\nto make sure I can do this the only way.\n\n467\n00:25:49.409 --> 00:25:52.985\nSpend time in each, test it out,\nlike what we're showing you,\n\n468\n00:25:52.985 --> 00:25:55.700\nmake sure it works the way you want it to.\n\n469\n00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.070\nIf it doesn't, that's where\nyou're gonna have some issues.\n\n470\n00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:03.249\nBut Mike, I wish I could say that we were\ndone, but the very fact is we're not done.\n\n471\n00:26:03.249 --> 00:26:05.179\nBut we are out of time for this episode.\n\n472\n00:26:05.179 --> 00:26:05.805\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie.\n\n473\n00:26:05.805 --> 00:26:10.322\nAgain, fantastic demonstrations, a lot of\ngreat information there, but as you said,\n\n474\n00:26:10.322 --> 00:26:11.658\nthere is still more to do.\n\n475\n00:26:11.658 --> 00:26:14.357\nSo we're gonna have to come back,\nwe're the part four.\n\n476\n00:26:14.357 --> 00:26:18.003\nSo everybody out there enjoy watching\nthis one signing off for ITPro TV,\n\n477\n00:26:18.003 --> 00:26:19.812\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n478\n00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:20.651\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n479\n00:26:20.651 --> 00:26:22.827\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n480\n00:26:22.827 --> 00:26:28.841\n[MUSIC]\n\n481\n00:26:28.841 --> 00:26:30.850\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV\n\n",

So a real easy thing so far.\n\n19\n00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.069\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It takes a little bit of time and\n\n20\n00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:54.577\nI'm going slow because\nmost people probably,\n\n21\n00:00:54.577 --> 00:00:59.370\nif this is your first time doing it,\nit's probably a little bit overwhelming.\n\n22\n00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.918\nUsually what ends up happening\nin the reality of things,\n\n23\n00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:08.669\nright, is probably the Exchange\nadministrator, right.\n\n24\n00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:09.862\nThe guy that does the email,\n\n25\n00:01:09.862 --> 00:01:13.059\nif there's anybody that's probably\ndoing the majority of it, it's him.\n\n26\n00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:19.011\nBut, because Office 365 gives us the\nability to go tenant-wide, in other words,\n\n27\n00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:24.474\nnot just searching, Exchange email boxes,\nbut of course SharePoint Online,\n\n28\n00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:29.800\nas well as your OneDrive for Business,\nto do that, well, it's right here.\n\n29\n00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.370\nIf everything is managed online, you\nas the actual office 365 administrator,\n\n30\n00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.610\nit may become your particular little\nnuance of what you have to be able to do.\n\n31\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.370\nSo we've gone ahead and started to\nshow you of course how to do that.\n\n32\n00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.150\nSo far we've created of course\nthe different SharePoint sites using those\n\n33\n00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.873\ntemplates that allow us to create what\nare called the eDiscovery Center.\n\n34\n00:01:52.873 --> 00:01:56.825\nWe also created a security group in\nExchange Online to be able to do this, so\n\n35\n00:01:56.825 --> 00:02:00.401\nthat we can add them in with\nthe permissions that we'll need to, and\n\n36\n00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:03.825\nwe're actually at that point of\nadding in permissions as well.\n\n37\n00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:07.702\nBut we talked about the importance\nof why we tend to do eDiscovery,\n\n38\n00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:10.200\nas well as how to begin to set it up.\n\n39\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.300\nAnd so that's where we\nare at this particular point\n\n40\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.390\nin which we're taking a look\nwhich is of course assigning\n\n41\n00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.260\nthe different SharePoint eDiscovery\npermissions that we are going to\n\n42\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.480\nneed to have on the different sites that\nmake sure that we get everything done.\n\n43\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.700\nSo we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand how to do that.\n\n44\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.412\nAnd don't forget that for the exam itself,\n\n45\n00:02:32.412 --> 00:02:36.368\nit is an emphasis on both understanding\nwhere to go in the web UI,\n\n46\n00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:40.649\nwhich is never intuitive,\nespecially when it comes to SharePoint.\n\n47\n00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:42.710\nAnd I really do mean this, Daniel,\n\n48\n00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.675\nthat one of the hardest things is not that\nyou can't understand why you're doing it.\n\n49\n00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:52.161\nIt's finding where on this\nplanet where inside the web UI.\n\n50\n00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:53.571\n&gt;&gt; They hide things very well don't they?\n\n51\n00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:57.330\nIt's like they don't want you to be able\nto do this or something but it is there.\n\n52\n00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.299\n&gt;&gt; It is there it just takes\na lot of searching and\n\n53\n00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.888\nmost of the time as you're doing this.\n\n54\n00:03:02.888 --> 00:03:06.700\neDiscovery is probably something you're\ngonna take a good bit of time to make sure\n\n55\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.335\nyou set up correctly and\ndo everything that you need to.\n\n56\n00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:12.109\nBut there's a lot of times,\nespecially in the midst of triage and\n\n57\n00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.786\nsome of the things that you're doing.\n\n58\n00:03:13.786 --> 00:03:17.840\nYou're trying to do it snap fast,\nand it's just not gonna be that way.\n\n59\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.439\nIf you don't know where things are,\nit's just not gonna happen.\n\n60\n00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.910\nSo that is what we are trying to do.\n\n61\n00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.258\nSo we're at this point where we\nare now configuring those permissions.\n\n62\n00:03:27.258 --> 00:03:31.390\nSo we have our security group and now we\nneed to make sure that there's a couple\n\n63\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.095\nthings that end up happening with\nthe security group that we can use.\n\n64\n00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:37.531\nAnd you might be wondering like why\nin the world would we choose to use\n\n65\n00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:38.580\na security group?\n\n66\n00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.638\nBecause it doesn't matter\nwhere we work in Office 365.\n\n67\n00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:46.560\nThat security group will work for\nus instead of me having to assign a single\n\n68\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.750\nadministrator and then if I realize that\nan administrator now leaves my team.\n\n69\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.457\nNow I have to go and\nassign an administrator to something else,\n\n70\n00:03:53.457 --> 00:03:57.330\nI can create a security group, it works\nwith Exchange, it works with SharePoint.\n\n71\n00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.350\nIt seems to be kind of the ideal\nchoice for us to make.\n\n72\n00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.989\nThen that way if Daniel is part of\nthat group, then he goes, Ronnie,\n\n73\n00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.684\nI'm not gonna work with your team anymore.\n\n74\n00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:07.495\nI just have to remove\nDaniel from that group and\n\n75\n00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:10.968\nthen replace Daniel with\nwhoever's name that I want to.\n\n76\n00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:16.328\nAnd that's as easy as it is, instead if we\nassign Daniel to every single one of them.\n\n77\n00:04:16.328 --> 00:04:20.244\nNow it's having to go back and actually\nre-assign every time I use Daniel's name\n\n78\n00:04:20.244 --> 00:04:23.796\nin a PowerShell script, and Daniel,\nyou know how much I love to type.\n\n79\n00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:26.810\n&gt;&gt; It is your favorite thing on this\nwhole entire earth, that's for sure, and\n\n80\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.716\nyou're so good at it.\n\n81\n00:04:27.716 --> 00:04:29.798\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm amazing at it.\n\n82\n00:04:29.798 --> 00:04:32.250\nSo, but\nthat's one of the reasons is why so\n\n83\n00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.263\nnow we're heading in this\npoint on the permission.\n\n84\n00:04:35.263 --> 00:04:38.274\nNow let's make sure we understand\nthat before we can issue any of\n\n85\n00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:41.397\nthe commands that you've seen in\nthe first three parts are ready as\n\n86\n00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:42.872\nwell as what we gonna see here.\n\n87\n00:04:42.872 --> 00:04:48.488\nWe need to be connected to Office\n365 through PowerShell okay so\n\n88\n00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:54.121\ndon't forget you'll need any of\nthose commands for connecting.\n\n89\n00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:59.111\nBoth to SharePoint as well as to Exchange\nOnline if everything's gonna work.\n\n90\n00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:02.933\nOne for the security group that you\nmake if you're gonna be doing it through\n\n91\n00:05:02.933 --> 00:05:03.670\nPowerShell.\n\n92\n00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.721\nAnd you might wonder,\nwhy wouldn't I do it through PowerShell?\n\n93\n00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:10.610\nWell for me, if I have a web UI I'm\ngonna do it through the web UI.\n\n94\n00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.050\nBut the exams, as they call it out,\nwe're gonna enable it.\n\n95\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.266\nWe've already enabled it\nthrough PowerShell here.\n\n96\n00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:16.910\nAnd the same thing with\nall the other ones.\n\n97\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.243\nSo make sure you go back and\ncheck those first three in this\n\n98\n00:05:20.243 --> 00:05:24.550\nparticular mini series inside of our\nseries that we're doing so far, and\n\n99\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.057\nmake sure that you go through and\nsee that.\n\n100\n00:05:27.057 --> 00:05:31.632\nAnd if you're going, hey, I don't remember\nhow to connect to that, the good thing is,\n\n101\n00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:33.218\nI've got my list of commands.\n\n102\n00:05:33.218 --> 00:05:36.399\nLet me see if I can just show that,\nI know, it's a little bit terrible,\n\n103\n00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:37.256\nhere on the notes.\n\n104\n00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:44.456\nBut this will actually be included in\na PDF on site for us, so don't go crazy.\n\n105\n00:05:44.456 --> 00:05:48.480\nYou can also, of course, look online and\nfind all of those different scripts out.\n\n106\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.760\nNow you could script out, but\nI the commands, I should say out for you.\n\n107\n00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.940\nAnd that way you'll know\nwhich ones to connect to.\n\n108\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.500\nIt just makes it easy for you to do.\n\n109\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.900\nSo I've already connected,\nand that's what we are doing.\n\n110\n00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.480\nSo let's take a look at my screen, and\nthis way we will kind of remind ourselves\n\n111\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.560\nof where we are and\nwhat we are trying to do here okay.\n\n112\n00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.485\nSo right now Here are the two eDiscovery\nsites that I created in one of our\n\n113\n00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:12.809\nparts that we had.\n\n114\n00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.692\nAnd this is where I also ran\ninto some trouble again and\n\n115\n00:06:15.692 --> 00:06:19.616\nyou heard me mention it now even with\nthat little series that I've done.\n\n116\n00:06:19.616 --> 00:06:23.467\nThe first couple of episodes here with\nMike, or one of the episodes here with\n\n117\n00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:26.910\nMike where I said I realized\nsomething after doing this.\n\n118\n00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.573\nDoing two sites at one time.\n\n119\n00:06:28.573 --> 00:06:32.034\nApparently when you do that\nwith SharePoint, it says, hey,\n\n120\n00:06:32.034 --> 00:06:35.443\nI know it's supposed to take 15 minutes,\nit takes hours.\n\n121\n00:06:35.443 --> 00:06:38.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once you actually do two at one time.\n\n122\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.955\nAnd that's partly my fault,\nI'll admit that, but\n\n123\n00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:42.925\noverall it's something I wasn't expecting.\n\n124\n00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:46.530\nI was just assuming 15 minutes,\n15 minutes no big deal, we'll do that.\n\n125\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.530\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; Even if it took 30 minutes, yeah.\n\n126\n00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.345\nIt's no big deal,\nbe a nice time out, right?\n\n127\n00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:52.790\n&gt;&gt; But on ours it took hours.\n\n128\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.460\nSo that's pretty much what it did.\n\n129\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.860\nAlso made these things consistent.\n\n130\n00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.549\nOne I made like 100 gigs\non the storage limit.\n\n131\n00:06:58.549 --> 00:07:00.868\nI didn't need it to be that big so\nI just made them,\n\n132\n00:07:00.868 --> 00:07:03.206\nthat's the only thing I\ndid is I changed the size.\n\n133\n00:07:03.206 --> 00:07:05.750\nBut those are the two that\nwe'll be working with.\n\n134\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.123\nLet's go ahead and check out the idea of\nthe ownership of these sites, so far.\n\n135\n00:07:10.123 --> 00:07:14.240\nSo I'm gonna select eDiscovery1,\nby putting a check mark here.\n\n136\n00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.544\nAnd the great thing is, we can find this\nout in a couple of different places.\n\n137\n00:07:17.544 --> 00:07:22.278\nBut this is where you're not\nsure what you're looking at.\n\n138\n00:07:22.278 --> 00:07:25.570\nAnd Daniel I wanna show you\nsomething right up here at the top.\n\n139\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.759\nAs we zoom in.\n\n140\n00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:27.784\n&gt;&gt; Show me Ronnie.\n\n141\n00:07:27.784 --> 00:07:30.431\n&gt;&gt; As far as ownership goes,\nyou would think this, right?\n\n142\n00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:30.943\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n143\n00:07:30.943 --> 00:07:35.679\n&gt;&gt; Manage ownership of the collective\nsite collection, go bingo.\n\n144\n00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:36.439\n&gt;&gt; You nailed it.\n\n145\n00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:41.349\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what we should be\ntaking look at here, so if I click,\n\n146\n00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:43.818\nnow notice what it says, Daniel.\n\n147\n00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:44.777\n&gt;&gt; Manage Administrators.\n\n148\n00:07:44.777 --> 00:07:46.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n149\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.605\n&gt;&gt; That's not owners per se.\n\n150\n00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:51.140\n&gt;&gt; Add,\nthat is a little bit confusing isn't it?\n\n151\n00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.849\n&gt;&gt; It might lead one to have\na little head scratch moment.\n\n152\n00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:57.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so you start looking at it,\nis this right or not?\n\n153\n00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:58.799\nSo what do I do?\n\n154\n00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:03.473\nI'm like well let's check on it,\nlet's see what happens here And\n\n155\n00:08:03.473 --> 00:08:06.486\nnow, it gets a little bit more confusing.\n\n156\n00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.458\n&gt;&gt; Joey Fatone.\n\n157\n00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:09.559\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's not a very nice\n\n158\n00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:10.783\nlast name you gave him.\n\n159\n00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:13.428\n&gt;&gt; I know, wow, there we go.\n\n160\n00:08:13.428 --> 00:08:14.920\nAll right, so, here it is.\n\n161\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.578\nYou know his fans are gonna write you now.\n\n162\n00:08:16.578 --> 00:08:18.130\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nI'm totally getting hammered.\n\n163\n00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.276\nI actually like Joey Fatone a lot,\nactually.\n\n164\n00:08:20.276 --> 00:08:22.325\nHe's a very entertaining man.\n\n165\n00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:25.090\n[LAUGH] I think he would\nlaugh at that joke.\n\n166\n00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:31.120\n&gt;&gt; If he's the guy I'm thinking of, he\nwas the one that was in the Greek movie.\n\n167\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.760\n&gt;&gt; I think he was, yeah.\n\n168\n00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.010\n&gt;&gt; If he was, he was really funny in that.\n\n169\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:33.635\n&gt;&gt; He is, he's really funny.\n\n170\n00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:34.990\n&gt;&gt; So there we go.\n\n171\n00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.940\nPrimary site collection administrator,\nsite collection administrators, Daniel,\n\n172\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.540\nI don't see owner anywhere, except for\nthe label on the button that we pushed.\n\n173\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.820\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n174\n00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so.\n\n175\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.560\n&gt;&gt; Totally misleading.\n\n176\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.900\n&gt;&gt; Is there where we need to go?\n\n177\n00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.310\nWell, let me show you one other\nplace that we can also go here, too.\n\n178\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.230\nSo right now,\nyou can see at least Joey is listed here.\n\n179\n00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.480\nBut let me click Cancel for a moment.\n\n180\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.810\nNow I wanna get into the admin center,\nfor this site.\n\n181\n00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:09.120\nSo if I click on eDiscovery1 again,\nand now notice the website address.\n\n182\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.970\nAnd I'm going to select\nthe website address.\n\n183\n00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:17.890\nAnd hopefully, it'll come in in just\na moment, as we start to see this.\n\n184\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.410\nYeah, and of course everything is\nslow in SharePoint, at this point.\n\n185\n00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.325\nSo what we should see of course,\nis the eDiscovery site,\n\n186\n00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:29.258\nthe one that we created with\nthe template sets out there.\n\n187\n00:09:29.258 --> 00:09:32.398\nAnd it is just, there it goes,\nI was like, man.\n\n188\n00:09:32.398 --> 00:09:36.080\nI think it's just crawling, just because\nI said it's crawling, at this point.\n\n189\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.640\nSo here's the template\nthat was essentially set.\n\n190\n00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.421\nThere's nothing really in there,\nexcept for setting all this stuff up, so\n\n191\n00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:45.670\nthat we can have it easier and\nthe way that we want to.\n\n192\n00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.580\nNotice that you also have cases and the\nsite contents, over on the left-hand side,\n\n193\n00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.760\nand that's part of\nthe template that it gives us,\n\n194\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.370\nnot just a regular document\nsite that we have.\n\n195\n00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.170\nBut if I need to come in here,\nand I need to adjust this for\n\n196\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.460\nthe ownership,\nI need to get into Site Settings.\n\n197\n00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.500\nAnd Site Settings is not\nexactly easily found,\n\n198\n00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.045\nexcept by going to this gear, which again,\nfairly intuitive, no, not at all.\n\n199\n00:10:08.045 --> 00:10:10.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And select Site Settings, down here,\n\n200\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.890\nwhich is the last one listed.\n\n201\n00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:17.940\nOnce I'm inside, now you start to see,\nwell a lot of different things, right?\n\n202\n00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.730\nLook at all of these different options\nthat I have set up and available, as well.\n\n203\n00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.060\nSo here's where it gets\na little bit confusing.\n\n204\n00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.170\nSite Collection Administration,\nSite Collection Administrators.\n\n205\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.740\nDaniel, what in the world,\nwhich one would you choose?\n\n206\n00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.300\n&gt;&gt; I'm back to the, that's a good\nquestion you got there Ronnie,\n\n207\n00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.310\nI'm not 100% sure on that.\n\n208\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.310\n&gt;&gt; Once again, this is what\nI'm trying to tell you, right?\n\n209\n00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.080\nIt's not as-\n&gt;&gt; Intuitive, yeah.\n\n210\n00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.320\n&gt;&gt; You would think that it'd say Owners.\n\n211\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.173\n&gt;&gt; Owners.\n&gt;&gt; Owners,\n\n212\n00:10:47.173 --> 00:10:50.157\nI think that that would be kinda key here.\n\n213\n00:10:50.157 --> 00:10:52.159\nBut under Permissions,\nsince that's what we're assigning,\n\n214\n00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:54.210\nwe're gonna stick with the users and\npermissions.\n\n215\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:59.400\nThis time, we select, make sure I'm\nsetting this one correctly here.\n\n216\n00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.323\nYes, the Site Permissions here.\n\n217\n00:11:03.323 --> 00:11:05.480\nSo I'm gonna go to Site Permissions first.\n\n218\n00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.420\nAnd then we'll come back to\nthe Site Administrators in a moment.\n\n219\n00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.416\nAnd this is finally, look at that Daniel.\n\n220\n00:11:10.416 --> 00:11:11.956\n&gt;&gt; There's actual eDiscovery owners.\n\n221\n00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:14.001\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now we've been down this road before.\n\n222\n00:11:14.001 --> 00:11:16.364\nWe might be being fooled,\nhit this and it's, I don't know,\n\n223\n00:11:16.364 --> 00:11:18.059\npeople that own a CVS or something, right?\n\n224\n00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:19.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah for all we know, right?\n\n225\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.400\nBut this one is definitely\nnamed after at least the site.\n\n226\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.578\nAnd now we have the Owners here.\n\n227\n00:11:24.578 --> 00:11:27.635\nIt's the first time we've seen Owners\nmentioned, since that one little button.\n\n228\n00:11:27.635 --> 00:11:30.830\nAnd everything else is like administrator,\nadministrators, administrator.\n\n229\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.870\nMost of us might make that argument and\ngo, of course an administrator can\n\n230\n00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.560\nact as they're the owner, but\nare they really the owner?\n\n231\n00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.940\nWell according to this, it may be a little\nbit different, but let's see here.\n\n232\n00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.735\nIf I now select eDiscovery Owners,\nnotice at this point here,\n\n233\n00:11:45.735 --> 00:11:52.172\non the eDiscovery Owners, it is showing no\none's actually the owner at this point.\n\n234\n00:11:52.172 --> 00:11:53.246\nSo that's a little bit strange here.\n\n235\n00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:54.890\n&gt;&gt; It's an orphaned site.\n\n236\n00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.050\n&gt;&gt; It looks like it is kind of orphaned\nout there, for what we're seeing.\n\n237\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.598\nBut let's check out something else.\n\n238\n00:12:00.598 --> 00:12:04.493\nLet me go to the PowerShell for\na moment, and\n\n239\n00:12:04.493 --> 00:12:08.507\nlet's do our get- SharePoint online site.\n\n240\n00:12:11.018 --> 00:12:16.542\nSo if I've typed this incorrectly,\nnow Daniel,\n\n241\n00:12:16.542 --> 00:12:23.521\nnotice that inside of the PowerShell,\nlook at this, Daniel.\n\n242\n00:12:25.249 --> 00:12:31.251\nIt tells me exactly who the owner is,\nbut inside of the web UI,\n\n243\n00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:35.649\nit didn't look like it listed anybody, so.\n\n244\n00:12:35.649 --> 00:12:36.584\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n245\n00:12:36.584 --> 00:12:41.050\nlet me just make sure I'm picking up\nwhat you're laying down here, Ronnie.\n\n246\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.730\nIf you go to the GUI, right?\n\n247\n00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.400\nYou're in the web interface, you go to\nOwners, which isn't actually owners, it's\n\n248\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.000\nadministrators, you have to follow a bunch\nof crazy links to actually find the owners\n\n249\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.570\narea, and when you do find it, it doesn't\nactually show the owner of the thing.\n\n250\n00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.350\nAre they just saying, you know what,\nforget this web UI stuff,\n\n251\n00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.890\njump into PowerShell is that\nwhat they're trying to say?\n\n252\n00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:02.760\n&gt;&gt; You would think that.\n\n253\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:05.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthat seems logical to me, right?\n\n255\n00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.670\nSo as I walked through this,\nI was like, this is\n\n256\n00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:15.130\nnot showing what I'm thinking it should\nshow and everything else is going on.\n\n257\n00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:19.010\nSo now if you needed to actually\nchange the owner, okay, or\n\n258\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:24.450\nassign ownership permissions, well,\nnormally, we already see who the owner is.\n\n259\n00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.310\nWe now need to make sure that Joey\nis part of that ownership group.\n\n260\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.490\nSo, strange enough, right?\n\n261\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.156\nThat even though there's\na eDiscovery Owners,\n\n262\n00:13:34.156 --> 00:13:37.480\nright, Joey isn't a part of it, even\nthough he was the one that created it.\n\n263\n00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.806\nSo, but\nhe's not given all the permissions to it.\n\n264\n00:13:40.806 --> 00:13:46.980\nSo in eDiscovery, if we're to do this for\nthis site, we actually have to take Joey,\n\n265\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.328\nand even though he's the owner,\nassign him into that Owners group.\n\n266\n00:13:51.328 --> 00:13:52.434\nGo figure.\n\n267\n00:13:52.434 --> 00:13:55.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think my brain just melted.\n\n268\n00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.318\nI feel the fizzing and the bubbling\nof the boiling brains right now.\n\n269\n00:13:58.318 --> 00:14:01.517\n&gt;&gt; Well that's because you and I would\nthink, if we're the ones that created it,\n\n270\n00:14:01.517 --> 00:14:02.102\nwe have what?\n\n271\n00:14:02.102 --> 00:14:05.370\nPermissions, full control,\neverything that we need to do.\n\n272\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.720\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I created the thing.\n\n273\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.025\n&gt;&gt; You created the thing,\n[LAUGH] you should be able to do this.\n\n274\n00:14:10.025 --> 00:14:12.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Makes sense that that\nwould be how it would work.\n\n275\n00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.610\n&gt;&gt; But in eDiscovery,\nmaybe not so much, right?\n\n276\n00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.556\nSo in eDiscovery, even though you\nmight be the one that created it,\n\n277\n00:14:18.556 --> 00:14:22.508\ndoesn't necessarily mean in eDiscovery, in\nthe action itself, you have full control.\n\n278\n00:14:22.508 --> 00:14:25.256\nGo figure [LAUGH].\n\n279\n00:14:25.256 --> 00:14:29.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm feeling a little taken\naback here, I don't know what to say.\n\n280\n00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.965\nTo me, logic and reason are apparently\na part of my makeup, but\n\n281\n00:14:32.965 --> 00:14:35.621\nnot the person that developed\nthis at Microsoft, so.\n\n282\n00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:41.168\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's got to be some reason for\nit, okay?\n\n283\n00:14:41.168 --> 00:14:44.202\n&gt;&gt; What those could be,\nI'd be interested in hearing.\n\n284\n00:14:44.202 --> 00:14:47.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not gonna say that I know\neverything that there is about that.\n\n285\n00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.950\nBut that one is a little bit confusing.\n\n286\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.130\nAnd that's why I wanted to show that.\n\n287\n00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.190\nSo even though everybody's like, Ronnie,\nyou just confused the heck out of me.\n\n288\n00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.400\nI meant to do that, because you might\nthink that I'm gonna type this in,\n\n289\n00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.230\nand it's gonna show up exactly where.\n\n290\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.513\nAnd then you're gonna go it's not there,\nand you're gonna say, it didn't show up.\n\n291\n00:15:04.513 --> 00:15:08.303\n&gt;&gt; Right, if you're unaware that this\nis how this works by nature, yes,\n\n292\n00:15:08.303 --> 00:15:11.538\nthe confusion is gonna be a part\nof your life, at that point.\n\n293\n00:15:11.538 --> 00:15:14.651\nSo Ronnie's using a little bit\nof over-stepping his boundaries,\n\n294\n00:15:14.651 --> 00:15:17.543\njust to make sure that we understand\nthis could get confusing,\n\n295\n00:15:17.543 --> 00:15:19.480\nif we don't know the proper channels.\n\n296\n00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so think about it this way.\n\n297\n00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.310\nWhen we create that eDiscovery\nsite itself, right,\n\n298\n00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.250\nwe're just really a site\ncollection creator.\n\n299\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.440\nBut when we come down to eDiscovery and\nwhat it's gonna really do,\n\n300\n00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.230\nwe're not really owning that\nprocess inside of SharePoint yet.\n\n301\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.700\nSo the only way to do that, then, is to\ncome here, let's go back to our screen.\n\n302\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.450\nAnd I've just selected the web UI again,\ncuz I knew that that would throw us off.\n\n303\n00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.528\nDo you wanna know how I knew?\n\n304\n00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:46.868\nCuz it threw me off.\n\n305\n00:15:46.868 --> 00:15:47.924\n&gt;&gt; It works very well.\n&gt;&gt; I did not do that.\n\n306\n00:15:47.924 --> 00:15:49.565\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So of course,\n\n307\n00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:53.798\nall you have to do is you click on New,\nand once you do so,\n\n308\n00:15:53.798 --> 00:15:58.600\nthis is where you can now enter\nin people's names, to do this.\n\n309\n00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.640\nSo, if I were to do this,\nI could enter in Joey's name.\n\n310\n00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.383\nAnd there it is.\n\n311\n00:16:04.383 --> 00:16:08.261\nJoey is now part of that eDiscovery 1,\n\n312\n00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:14.500\nin what it needs to do in the owners\ngroup here has full control.\n\n313\n00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.700\nEven though he wasn't\nthe one that created it.\n\n314\n00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.730\n&gt;&gt; He's already there, yeah.\n\n315\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.380\n&gt;&gt; He's not officially there.\n\n316\n00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.380\nSo, there we go.\n\n317\n00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:28.450\nNow, what we really want to do\nthough is we want to make sure,\n\n318\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:35.090\nthat since we created that group,\nif I can spell eDiscovery, there we go.\n\n319\n00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.830\nThat eDiscovery's manager,\nthat's the security group we created,\n\n320\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.300\nthat they also have these\npermissions here too.\n\n321\n00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.070\nWhy?\nBecause with the owners,\n\n322\n00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:50.380\nthe eDiscovery owners permissions,\nit gives them, whoever's in this group,\n\n323\n00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.110\nthat's Joey and the eDiscovery manager,\nwhoever is in there.\n\n324\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.300\nI don't know if I actually\nassigned anybody in there,\n\n325\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.940\nI think I assigned Lance in there.\n\n326\n00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.820\nBut whoever's actually in there, right,\n\n327\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.450\nthat gives them the permission to be\nable to put holds on mailboxes and\n\n328\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.180\non SharePoint stuff, it gives them the\nability to search through the different\n\n329\n00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:13.520\nlogs, it allows them to be able\nto crawl through SharePoint.\n\n330\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.120\nYou name it, it gives them what they need.\n\n331\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.870\nSo when they're doing this,\nthat's what we want.\n\n332\n00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:20.370\nWe want them to have that.\n\n333\n00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.610\nWithout those permissions,\nit doesn't happen.\n\n334\n00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:23.840\nAnd that the key.\n\n335\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.690\nSo this is where you would then\nclick here, where it says, Share.\n\n336\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.670\nAnd now, it allows that to do that and\n\n337\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.680\nthen those people will get\nan email that says, hey,\n\n338\n00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.470\nyou've been invited into this group and\nnow you can see where it's both of these.\n\n339\n00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:42.200\nRemember that security group has to\nhave an email enabled security group.\n\n340\n00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.280\nIt can't just be an Office 365 group,\n\n341\n00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.629\nit can't be a distribution group,\nit has to be email enabled.\n\n342\n00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.670\nThat's just a part of it, and that's\nsomething that you want to make sure of.\n\n343\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.800\nNow, let's see what happens\ninside of the PowerShell.\n\n344\n00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.900\nIf I run this again,\n\n345\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.670\nyou think that anything's been\nadded here in the owner now?\n\n346\n00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.500\nLet's see if anything changes,\njust by doing that.\n\n347\n00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.550\nNo, okay?\n\n348\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.360\n&gt;&gt; Looks identical.\n\n349\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's identical,\nthat's because what?\n\n350\n00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:09.910\nThe eDiscoveries didn't do what?\n\n351\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.870\nThey didn't create the site,\nthey weren't the ones that created it.\n\n352\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:18.190\nAll the rest of these that have no\nowner in them at all right here, okay,\n\n353\n00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.560\nwell they're not actually\nthe ones that created this.\n\n354\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.170\nSo that's the system that created these.\n\n355\n00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.426\nSo the ones that don't have an owner,\n\n356\n00:18:26.426 --> 00:18:31.080\nthat's when we kind of first kind of\nlogged in and SharePoint was generated for\n\n357\n00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.370\nus and it does a search,\nand then this IT tier one.\n\n358\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.380\nThis was something that I did\na little bit earlier as well.\n\n359\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.470\nBut you can kind of see\nwhere this changes up and\n\n360\n00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.890\ndoes some of the different\nstuff that you want.\n\n361\n00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.370\nSo that's kind of a key when\nwe start to do this, and\n\n362\n00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.390\nit's something that we definitely\nneed to pay attention to\n\n363\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.151\nbecause this is where it gets stranger,\nDaniel.\n\n364\n00:18:52.151 --> 00:18:54.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know it's strange, right?\n\n365\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:59.540\nWe really haven't done the justice\nin terms of assigning the ownership\n\n366\n00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:06.650\npermissions then to who we needed to here,\nokay.\n\n367\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:10.330\nNow, when you do something like this,\nit's gonna end up doing this.\n\n368\n00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:15.540\nSo we're gonna take eDiscovery two here,\nand we are actually gonna change the owner\n\n369\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.040\nof the eDiscovery site\nright here in PowerShell.\n\n370\n00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.110\nAnd this one will actually have\na little bit of a different change\n\n371\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.390\nwhen we start to take a look\nin the web GUI as well.\n\n372\n00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:29.680\nSo that is what we are going to do.\n\n373\n00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.255\nSo let's set the owner now,\n\n374\n00:19:34.255 --> 00:19:40.543\nif I do this it's gonna be set dash spo,\n\n375\n00:19:40.543 --> 00:19:47.445\nsite https officeprodemoco Sharepoint.\n\n376\n00:19:47.445 --> 00:19:52.950\nSharePoint.com, sites and\nthis one I'm gonna do for\n\n377\n00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:58.750\neDiscovery2 this time.\n\n378\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:02.330\nI'm gonna use the dash here and\nthen the owner.\n\n379\n00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:06.187\nNow when I set this up,\n\n380\n00:20:06.187 --> 00:20:11.265\nI instead am actually gonna do\n\n381\n00:20:11.265 --> 00:20:16.749\nthe eDiscovery Managers here,\n\n382\n00:20:16.749 --> 00:20:21.625\nMGR@officeprodemoco on,\n\n383\n00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:26.094\noops, Microsoft.com,\n\n384\n00:20:26.094 --> 00:20:32.310\nmake sure I get all that on there.\n\n385\n00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.530\nAnd here's something that will\nkind of chip you up as well.\n\n386\n00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.950\nNotice at the very end I also\nadded in this command NoWait.\n\n387\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:45.810\nIf I don't do that, it can take,\nin theory up to 15 minutes.\n\n388\n00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.720\nBut it can take much longer and I know\nbecause I did this the other day as well\n\n389\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.230\nand it took much longer than I thought,\nbut if I issues this no way command here,\n\n390\n00:20:55.230 --> 00:21:00.420\nit shouldn't take super\nlong before we actually\n\n391\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.820\nsee what finishes this particular command,\nbut it might take a moment here.\n\n392\n00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:09.090\nSo now, let's see,\nit added in a weird command there.\n\n393\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.990\nLet's see what happens.\n\n394\n00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.760\nWell that's unusual.\n\n395\n00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.971\nLet me see, get, SPO site.\n\n396\n00:21:21.629 --> 00:21:26.180\nNow notice this, okay, so even though it\ngave me an error, it did change something.\n\n397\n00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.980\nIt doesn't like the no wait,\nthat's what it's telling me.\n\n398\n00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:28.590\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n399\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:33.440\n&gt;&gt; But, remember that we were looking at\neDiscovery2 and look at who the owner is.\n\n400\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.180\nMakes sense.\n\n401\n00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.240\nCuz he's the one that created it.\n\n402\n00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.440\nNow, as we look at eDiscovery\nafter that command with a no wait,\n\n403\n00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.700\nnotice it has disappeared.\n\n404\n00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.350\nSo now that it has disappeared,\nyou're probably like saying, well,\n\n405\n00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.570\nwho is the owner and whether or\nnot we actually do have those permissions?\n\n406\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:53.050\nWell, let's check it out back the way that\nI showed you a little bit earlier here.\n\n407\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.690\nLet's go back in and\nnow I have to switch the sites again.\n\n408\n00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.090\nSo I need to get let me close that out and\n\n409\n00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:03.178\nlet's get back into, it's telling\nme I haven't paid my phone bill.\n\n410\n00:22:03.178 --> 00:22:04.787\n&gt;&gt;

It's a group.\n\n445\n00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.273\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it now is a group.\n\n446\n00:23:54.273 --> 00:23:58.289\nAnd normally, when we start doing this,\njust because I change the owner,\n\n447\n00:23:58.289 --> 00:24:02.561\nnotice it actually changed it here, the\nprimary site collection as well as this\n\n448\n00:24:02.561 --> 00:24:06.668\nNow let's see what happens in that\nowner's group and see what we get there.\n\n449\n00:24:06.668 --> 00:24:09.260\nThat's where we had to\ngo to the site itself.\n\n450\n00:24:13.042 --> 00:24:15.360\nAnd I love the number of tabs\nit keeps opening for me.\n\n451\n00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.780\nI'm gonna be able to keep track\nof that when they're that crazy.\n\n452\n00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.573\n&gt;&gt; Why is this Internet Explorer\nusing 17 gigs of RAM?\n\n453\n00:24:21.573 --> 00:24:23.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, why is that happening?\n\n454\n00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.900\nSo here we go, now that we're up,\nselect the gear.\n\n455\n00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.440\nAnd then we'll select Site Settings.\n\n456\n00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.040\nSo we're taking you through\nthe same thing again just so\n\n457\n00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.580\nthat we can see this at this point.\n\n458\n00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:40.526\nOnce we have it to this particular point\nhere, let's go into Site Permissions for\n\n459\n00:24:40.526 --> 00:24:43.578\ne-discovery 2.\n\n460\n00:24:43.578 --> 00:24:50.895\nAnd this time, Oops,\nlet me select that, come on.\n\n461\n00:24:54.416 --> 00:24:58.290\nMaybe it didn't refresh yet,\nor it's not come in yet.\n\n462\n00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.870\nNow, this is what I need to tell you.\n\n463\n00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.380\nDid this a little bit earlier, and\n\n464\n00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.160\nit absolutely did show up\nthe eDiscovery owners here too.\n\n465\n00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.200\nSo at this point, I'm gonna say it's\na timing issue that may be happening.\n\n466\n00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.630\nLet me see if I just refresh it and\nsee if it comes in.\n\n467\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:17.690\nIf I can't prove it there,\n\n468\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.820\nI'll prove it in another way,\nbecause that's the other thing I want to.\n\n469\n00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.760\nBut it should come in here, sooner or\nlater it's probably gonna pop up here.\n\n470\n00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.360\nI was assuming it would\ndo it very quickly.\n\n471\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.330\nBut let's check it out\nanother way as well.\n\n472\n00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.720\nWe'll go back to PowerShell here, and\n\n473\n00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.400\nthis is another definitive\nway to check this out too.\n\n474\n00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.700\nSo If I want to verify this,\nI now do that get sposite,\n\n475\n00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:44.800\nand let's see if I can do this.\n\n476\n00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.913\nAnd instead, what we are going\nto do is take away the owner and\n\n477\n00:25:49.913 --> 00:25:55.327\ntype in detailed, oops maybe,\nI'm using the tabfill here,\n\n478\n00:25:55.327 --> 00:26:00.080\nit's not the site that I need actually,\nit is site.\n\n479\n00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:07.361\nJust wanted to make sure eDiscovery,\nSites.\n\n480\n00:26:07.361 --> 00:26:08.510\nYeah.\n\n481\n00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.108\nJust want to make sure I'm\ntyping it in right here.\n\n482\n00:26:10.108 --> 00:26:14.430\nDetailed time\n\n483\n00:26:20.068 --> 00:26:24.870\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie I think your Achilles' heel\nmay be Achilles healing you again.\n\n484\n00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.940\nI think you have a typo there at\nthe very beginning of your command.\n\n485\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:32.410\n&gt;&gt; Daniel as I look at it now,\nI think you're absolutely right.\n\n486\n00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.490\n&gt;&gt; That shouldn't say set sposite.\n\n487\n00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.430\nThat should be get sposite.\n\n488\n00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:40.420\n&gt;&gt; An important difference.\n\n489\n00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.040\n&gt;&gt; It is very actually an important\ndifference here between set and get.\n\n490\n00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.570\nAnd let's see now.\n\n491\n00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.330\nThat's exactly what I was looking for.\n\n492\n00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.870\n&gt;&gt; Things you were looking for.\n\n493\n00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:50.940\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n494\n00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.640\nSo remember that when we saw\nthe SPO sites listed earlier, and\n\n495\n00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.550\nI showed you where there's no\nowner here on eDiscovery 2.\n\n496\n00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.690\nBut if I run this where I'm telling you,\nget the site and\n\n497\n00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.570\ngive me all the details behind it.\n\n498\n00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.710\nNow notice Daniel, I have an owner\n\n499\n00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:11.380\nwith their security\nidentifier listed right here.\n\n500\n00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.960\nSo I know that ownership's been assigned.\n\n501\n00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.700\nBut who is that owner?\n\n502\n00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.540\nThere are people that are better\nat PowerShell than I am that can\n\n503\n00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.050\nactually pipe that into something useful.\n\n504\n00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.500\nRonnie has to do it in two commands.\n\n505\n00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So that's what it comes down to.\n\n506\n00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.080\nSo when it comes down to this,\n\n507\n00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.910\nwe'll kind of do the same thing again,\nI'm just gonna hit the up arrow.\n\n508\n00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:38.970\nAnd this time what I'm going to do is just\nsimply run without the detail there this.\n\n509\n00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.678\nAnd let me verify that I'm actually\ngetting that one correctly.\n\n510\n00:27:41.678 --> 00:27:47.430\nAnd now, If I take a look here.\n\n511\n00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.570\nWhere's the, oops, hold on.\n\n512\n00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:54.384\nAgain it was my typo.\n\n513\n00:27:54.384 --> 00:27:56.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like wait a minute,\n\n514\n00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.670\nit got me the site.\n\n515\n00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:58.800\nI need spouser.\n\n516\n00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.000\nSee, that's what I get for reading and\ntrying to type at the same time too.\n\n517\n00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.340\nNow there we go.\n\n518\n00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.690\n&gt;&gt; Hey look, there's a user there.\n\n519\n00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see where we'll just\nkind of take the first little bit.\n\n520\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.260\nNotice that one ends in let's say 3-7-\n&gt;&gt; 3-7-6-0.\n\n521\n00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do that.\n\n522\n00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.270\nAnd if I come down here and\nlet's say, look at that.\n\n523\n00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:16.800\n&gt;&gt; 3760.\n\n524\n00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.260\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n525\n00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.730\nSo now the ownership is actually there.\n\n526\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.230\nIt's taking a little bit of time\nbefore it actually gets up there\n\n527\n00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:24.710\ninto that eDiscovery owners.\n\n528\n00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.630\nBut if it doesn't get up there,\nyou've got to make sure it gets in there.\n\n529\n00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:32.740\nSo even if something happens like mine,\nit's just waiting its time.\n\n530\n00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.730\nAnd you're going, I know it's gonna\nappear at some point in time.\n\n531\n00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.160\nOr, Ronnie is just totally wrong.\n\n532\n00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.030\nMake sure it gets into\nthe eDiscovery owners group,\n\n533\n00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.430\nis what we wanna make sure of,\nwhen we start to see that.\n\n534\n00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.850\nSo very important part of\nwhat we need to happen here.\n\n535\n00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.570\nBut just understanding that\nthat owner thing, it's trippy.\n\n536\n00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.090\nThat's the only way to describe it.\n\n537\n00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.430\nAnd once you get that down, you actually\nshould be able to see that hey,\n\n538\n00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.730\nat this point, it's gonna end up working,\nand you're gonna be fine.\n\n539\n00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:07.060\nBut at least that, and\nwe still got a bit to go, but I think,\n\n540\n00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:11.730\nDaniel, I have, once again, talked so\nmuch that we've run out of time.\n\n541\n00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:15.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, in your defense, we had to\ncircle the wagons 25 times and go through\n\n542\n00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.130\nthe Amazon jungle just to figure out\nwhere the heck we were supposed to go so\n\n543\n00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.510\nthat we can verify and set the owner and\nthat thing for these sites.\n\n544\n00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.560\nSo I'm not gonna blame Ronnie on this one,\nbut he's right, we are out of time for\n\n545\n00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.450\nthis episode.\n\n546\n00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:30.120\nWe will have to trudge on in to part five.\n\n547\n00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.220\nPart five ladies and gentlemen.\n\n548\n00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.120\nIt's like a Rocky series at this point.\n\n549\n00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.420\nRambo, Rocky,\nyou guys ain't got nothing except for\n\n550\n00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.100\nthe multibillions of\ndollars that you make.\n\n551\n00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.500\n&gt;&gt;

studio again,\nright, we have to continue,\n\n11\n00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:32.660\nwe couldn't leave you guys hanging.\n\n12\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.620\nThis is definitely a part\nfive of eDiscovery.\n\n13\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.764\nHere to finish it out, the culmination at\nleast fingers crossed, right everyone?\n\n14\n00:00:39.764 --> 00:00:41.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n15\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.410\nRonnie, welcome back.\n\n16\n00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.470\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you again.\n\n17\n00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.500\nI can't promise you-\n&gt;&gt; He's not making any promises.\n\n18\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.600\n&gt;&gt; No, there's no way y'all.\n\n19\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.660\nI'm gonna assume it's the end, but\nif not it will be a Harry Potter series.\n\n20\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.299\n&gt;&gt; We'll call it the culmination part two.\n\n21\n00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:54.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.550\n&gt;&gt; That would be a neat horror story.\n\n23\n00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That could end up coming out here.\n\n24\n00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.210\nLet's continue on as we talk\nabout more eDiscovery and\n\n25\n00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.540\nsome of the things we have to set up.\n\n26\n00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.200\nSo in our last episode,\nshowed you the kind of little weird\n\n27\n00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.150\nthings about setting up the ownership for\nthose sites, and that's very important\n\n28\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.720\nbecause without the ownership in\nthe eDiscovery owner's group for that site\n\n29\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.220\nWe really can't do some of the things\nthat we need to do in need discovery.\n\n30\n00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.990\nSo that has to be set up and\nmake sure that it's also in there too.\n\n31\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.430\nSo we showed you of course inside the GUI,\ninside of the web GUI,\n\n32\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.180\nas well as on PowerShell\nitself on how to get your\n\n33\n00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.690\nparticular security group\ninto that owners group too.\n\n34\n00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.654\nNow, you might end up seeing that if it\ndoesn't get into that eDiscovery group,\n\n35\n00:01:41.654 --> 00:01:45.034\njust make sure you know how to get\nthere to verify that it's in there in\n\n36\n00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:45.694\nthe web DUI.\n\n37\n00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:48.610\nAnd that will be helpful as well.\n\n38\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.700\nSo just make sure you check that out.\n\n39\n00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.870\nBut before you move on\nto the next portion.\n\n40\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.280\nNormally, once we have\nthe ownership permissions on,\n\n41\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.900\nthis is where we have to kind of know\na couple of things are going to happen.\n\n42\n00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.310\nIf everything is set up the way that it\nshould be set up and everything is working\n\n43\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.050\nright, the great thing is we now\nneed to set up what we call,\n\n44\n00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.630\nof course,\nsite collection administrators also.\n\n45\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.130\nSo our E discovery manager is\na security group that we created and\n\n46\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.290\nwe also need them to be in the site\ncollection administrators group.\n\n47\n00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.920\nLet's go ahead and\nmake sure we know where to find the site\n\n48\n00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.100\ncollection administrators group too.\n\n49\n00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.400\nSo as we take a look back at my screen,\nwe'll go ahead and see this option too.\n\n50\n00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.873\nSo I'm gonna use eDiscovery1.\n\n51\n00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:37.950\nI've kinda been going back and forth.\n\n52\n00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.350\nAnd once again, it's logging me out,\nsaying hey Ronnie.\n\n53\n00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.650\nLet's see if this one shows up any.\n\n54\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.160\nNope, so\n\n55\n00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.270\nit really is timing out in between\njust about everything that I'm doing.\n\n56\n00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.080\nI'll see if it actually allows me\nto get back into the SharePoint for\n\n57\n00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.020\njust a moment, and\nthen we'll go from there as well.\n\n58\n00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.240\nSo the only thing I'm gonna do\nis head to the site settings.\n\n59\n00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.197\nAnd once I'm inside the site settings,\nthat is where we'll discover our,\n\n60\n00:03:06.197 --> 00:03:10.347\nSite collection administrators group that\nwe see under Users and Permissions and\n\n61\n00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:12.280\nthat's what we need to set up as well.\n\n62\n00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.009\nSo the good thing is, this is not locked\nout now when we select eDiscovery.\n\n63\n00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:20.601\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n64\n00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:21.750\n&gt;&gt; And then, of course,\n\n65\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.590\nthe web address that we need to\nget to that particular site.\n\n66\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.430\nOnce I'm inside of eDiscovery, I'm going\nto select the gear then site settings.\n\n67\n00:03:32.718 --> 00:03:37.850\nOnce we're in site settings,\ngreat thing is, it is listed right here.\n\n68\n00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.900\nSite collection administrator is\nthe one that we're looking for.\n\n69\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.260\nIf I select the site\ncollection administrator,\n\n70\n00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.570\nnow you can see at least for\nthe first one, the E Discovery one.\n\n71\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.530\nHere is the site collection administrator.\n\n72\n00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.860\nNow this is fine if only Joey is\ngonna be doing the e-discovery.\n\n73\n00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.660\nIf Joey is not the only one doing the\ne-discovery, this is instead when we do,\n\n74\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.830\nwe wanna make sure we select\nthe security group that we created.\n\n75\n00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.890\nAlso, add him in here, too.\n\n76\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.940\nAnd this will go ahead and\nallow us to do that.\n\n77\n00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.350\nThat can be done fairly quickly,\nfairly easily.\n\n78\n00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.497\nNot exactly a big deal.\n\n79\n00:04:18.497 --> 00:04:21.990\nYou're probably saying Ronnie that was\nthe easiest thing that we had to do.\n\n80\n00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.050\nAs easy as it is to do,\nit also means that there's a Power\n\n81\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.280\nshell side of this thing too which\nis not much more difficult but\n\n82\n00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.850\nit is a little bit more challenging\nas we also need to set this one up.\n\n83\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.000\nSo there is a couple of ways where\nyou can do this as you set it up and\n\n84\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.130\nwhat I've chosen to do instead is\nkinda show you a nice little I wanna\n\n85\n00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.480\nsay it's a script that I found right there\non Microsoft's documentation, instead.\n\n86\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.080\nNow, you might be wondering why in\nthe world would I do something like\n\n87\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.230\nthis instead?\n\n88\n00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.070\nWell, let's imagine that you\nactually do host multiple sites\n\n89\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.230\nthat you want to be able to do\nthe eDiscovery on, as well.\n\n90\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.170\nWell, instead of you having to type\nin this last line every time for\n\n91\n00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.410\nevery single site,\nyou can go ahead and script this out.\n\n92\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.950\nAnd instead change these\ndifferent variables up here,\n\n93\n00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.180\nto where you actually change it to\nthe tenant name, and then, of course,\n\n94\n00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.560\nyour different sites, and the user that\nyou want to become the site owner.\n\n95\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.610\nSo on this one,\nI've selected eDiscovery 1 so\n\n96\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.160\nthat we can see that it really\nis adding this in here.\n\n97\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.320\nI'm gonna use lance as the user\nthat we're gonna add in.\n\n98\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:41.190\nAnd once I do that we'll also add him\nin here and the key on the Power Shell\n\n99\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.680\nis this very last section right here that\nyou want to make sure that you do see.\n\n100\n00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.710\nSo if you are gonna add in someone, at\nleast a particular user, you can also of\n\n101\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.960\ncourse use the eDiscovery managers\ngroup to also add it in here as well.\n\n102\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.260\nSo I can do that too but I'm just gonna\nuse Lance as an example of how to do this\n\n103\n00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.910\ninstead is site collection admin.\n\n104\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.560\nThat's different from site admin.\n\n105\n00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.530\nMake sure you note that so it is site\ncollection admin and that you equals true.\n\n106\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.470\nThe way to run this, I just put into\na regular Notepad file is what I did.\n\n107\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.330\nSo I've selected everything,\na copy of the whole thing.\n\n108\n00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.780\nCome down here and\n\n109\n00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.730\nthen simply paste it, well maybe if\nI actually copied it it would help.\n\n110\n00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.040\nWell maybe not, maybe I didn't copy it.\n\n111\n00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.271\nThought I did.\nLet's try one more time, Edit &gt; Copy.\n\n112\n00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:43.300\n[LAUGH] If not I'll have to type it in.\n\n113\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.390\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n114\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.810\n&gt;&gt; And let that all run, and\nnow you can see where it went ahead and\n\n115\n00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.340\nran everything.\n\n116\n00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.710\nSo that's all you're doing, is you're\njust changing these variables out and\n\n117\n00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.090\nthen running this generic script instead.\n\n118\n00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.340\nAnd now we have that site collection\nadministrator and it's displayed as Lance.\n\n119\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.440\nThe easy way to verify\nthis is to go back into\n\n120\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.360\nour site settings and\nI did select the discovery one.\n\n121\n00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.090\nI wanna make sure I do that correctly.\n\n122\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.370\nThen we'll actually take\na look underneath the site.\n\n123\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.800\nIf it kicks me out again,\nI'm gonna be kind of upset but\n\n124\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.160\nit looks like it may and\ndo that for just a moment there.\n\n125\n00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.970\nBut once we go in,\n\n126\n00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:30.070\nwe should also see of course Lance inside\nthe site collection administrators too.\n\n127\n00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.320\nAnd this will also help when we do this.\n\n128\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.260\nSo now notice that along\nwith that It added in,\n\n129\n00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.190\nwhen I added in the eDiscoveryMgrs,\nthere it is, Lance was also added in here.\n\n130\n00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.910\nSo that gives you that ability to\nmake sure that that's added in.\n\n131\n00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.405\nWe can try this and let's see what\nhappens if we change this up.\n\n132\n00:07:55.387 --> 00:08:00.272\nAnd then we'll do the eDiscovery2 site.\n\n133\n00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:02.385\nThis time for the user here.\n\n134\n00:08:02.385 --> 00:08:09.996\nI'll just type in ediscovery mgr is here.\n\n135\n00:08:14.455 --> 00:08:17.506\nAnd we'll select the whole thing again,\nor maybe,\n\n136\n00:08:24.696 --> 00:08:27.100\nLet's see if it errors out this time.\n\n137\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.770\nYeah, it doesn't like this\nparticular aspect of it.\n\n138\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.390\nSo you might find out something\njust like I did here,\n\n139\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.320\nis that it doesn't like that\ngroup to be added in that way.\n\n140\n00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.040\nSo there may be a way to do this,\nbut if it were me\n\n141\n00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.690\nI would just make sure that in the web UI\nthat I add them in just like I did here.\n\n142\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.580\nAnd that's probably something you'll\nhave to actually be able to do\n\n143\n00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.140\nmanually instead.\n\n144\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.320\nSo I didn't, I wasn't able to find\nan actual PowerShell equal command\n\n145\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.240\nthat would allow me to do a regular group,\nbut I still wanted to try and see\n\n146\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.040\nif that would work just by substituting\nin the name to make it happen.\n\n147\n00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.620\nSo make sure that you understand that\nthis is where you would set it up\n\n148\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.030\nas being that site\ncollection administrator.\n\n149\n00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.500\nNow the reason why this is important is,\n\n150\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.660\nbecause there's a couple things that\nwill also end up happening here.\n\n151\n00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.830\nWe need this administration so\n\n152\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.670\nthat we can access all the content\nwithin SharePoint organization first.\n\n153\n00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.510\nSo we're not just talking about\na single SharePoint site as well,\n\n154\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.720\neven though it's actually\nright there in that site.\n\n155\n00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.220\nBut this site collection administrator\nitself, is actually global at this point.\n\n156\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.926\nSo that way, I can crawl through\neverything If I need to.\n\n157\n00:09:32.926 --> 00:09:37.425\nAt the same time, I also can view\ndifferent results by having these in site\n\n158\n00:09:37.425 --> 00:09:40.940\ncollection administrator permissions too.\n\n159\n00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.200\nIf you do this at the entire top level,\nit will also allow you to\n\n160\n00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.890\ncrawl the error logs if you need to,\nas well as export or\n\n161\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:55.000\nsee the results of the export\nthat you have available.\n\n162\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.050\nSo that is something that\nis very important for\n\n163\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.730\nus as we get started here, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.920\nNow once that's done, I'm gonna cancel\nthat, cuz I don't really need it anymore.\n\n165\n00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.800\nWe also need the second part, and\nI just mentioned the word crawl.\n\n166\n00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.730\nAnd this might be, I don't wanna say it's\na brand new term, most of us are probably\n\n167\n00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.270\nnot familiar with that if we've come just\nfrom the world of server administrator.\n\n168\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:20.120\nAnd not anything with databases so much,\nor even exchange, the idea of actually\n\n169\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.476\ngoing through what we call a crawl is\nsomething that we have to be able to do.\n\n170\n00:10:23.476 --> 00:10:26.740\nSo the e-discovery manager's group itself,\n\n171\n00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.240\nwe also need to assign what we call read\npermissions, so that they can actually\n\n172\n00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.710\nuse crawl log information for\nthe entire organization as well.\n\n173\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.566\nAnd once we start talking about the idea\nof crawling through the organization,\n\n174\n00:10:40.566 --> 00:10:45.460\nthis is what e-discovery is\npretty much designed for,\n\n175\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.110\nwhen it comes down to it, Daniel.\n\n176\n00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:52.570\nThe idea is simple, right now if I do a\nsearch, it's really limited to what I own,\n\n177\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.000\nand what's shared to me,\nI can actually look through that.\n\n178\n00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.290\nBut I am pretty much limited to that.\n\n179\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.770\nEven if we go to emails, I'm actually\nlimited only to my own emails.\n\n180\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.180\nBut when we're doing e discovery\nwhich is normally brought up,\n\n181\n00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.560\nbecause there's some regulation or some\ntype of case that has been brought up.\n\n182\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.560\nAnd they're requesting let's say every\nemail that has Daniel's name mentioned\n\n183\n00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.470\nin it, and it might be where\nDaniel did sent a lot of those.\n\n184\n00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:25.130\nBut there may actually be emails between\nme and somebody where we mentioned Daniel,\n\n185\n00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.690\nand Daniel had nothing involved in\nthat as far as in that chain but\n\n186\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.440\nyou still want that in part of that case.\n\n187\n00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.540\nWell that's where the crawl comes through,\nright?\n\n188\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.980\nIt actually crawls through everything.\n\n189\n00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.900\n&gt;&gt; So it finds related data as\nwell as not just owned data.\n\n190\n00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n191\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.203\nYeah, and\nthat's a good way to put it, Daniel.\n\n192\n00:11:42.203 --> 00:11:46.642\nA great way to put it, cuz my mind wasn't\ncoming up with a great way to put it.\n\n193\n00:11:46.642 --> 00:11:47.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, it's looking for\n\n194\n00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.890\neverything that might do that.\n\n195\n00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.790\nSo, it takes a look at keywords.\n\n196\n00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.850\nIt allows us to look at that\ninformation and then we do that.\n\n197\n00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.710\nYou can also do it by a particular\nrange of dates if you want to, or\n\n198\n00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.090\nyou do that in combination with\nthe keywords that you want.\n\n199\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.430\nAnd that may pull it up,\nyou might even limit it to exchange email,\n\n200\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.730\nyou might limit it across SharePoint only,\nor just OneDrive, or you may say no,\n\n201\n00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.740\nwe need to look through everything.\n\n202\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.899\nSo once the indexing for e-discovery is\nset up, that's where the crawl helps.\n\n203\n00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:20.596\nNow, we don't really want\nsomebody to change that,\n\n204\n00:12:20.596 --> 00:12:25.117\nso even the e-discovery managers,\nwe don't want them actually\n\n205\n00:12:25.117 --> 00:12:29.327\naffecting it to what they can\nrewrite the way that it crawls.\n\n206\n00:12:29.327 --> 00:12:33.808\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna sign\nthose re permissions instead to be able to\n\n207\n00:12:33.808 --> 00:12:35.190\ndo this.\n\n208\n00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.230\nAnd so let's take a look at how\nwe do this and now this one,\n\n209\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.200\nI'm not going to worry trying to\ndo this inside of the PowerShell.\n\n210\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.160\nBecause it's a little bit more unusual\nin what has to happen when we start\n\n211\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.130\nto do this.\n\n212\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:52.712\nSo I'm gonna get out of\nthe SharePoint site completely, and\n\n213\n00:12:52.712 --> 00:13:00.059\nnow this is where the nature of Office\n365 being as massive as it is hurts you.\n\n214\n00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:06.039\nSo, if I were to say, just on the exam,\nDaniel and I were to say here it is,\n\n215\n00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:11.736\nokay, if you needed to implement\npermissions, crawl permissions.\n\n216\n00:13:11.736 --> 00:13:14.694\n[LAUGH] where would you go?\n\n217\n00:13:14.694 --> 00:13:17.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing my best get would be\n\n218\n00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.610\nunder admin.\n\n219\n00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.150\n&gt;&gt; You are getting closer, okay?\n\n220\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.930\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n221\n00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.290\nSo Daniel, one point for you,\nyou are heading in the right direction.\n\n222\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:26.890\nSo, Daniel,\n\n223\n00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.400\nnow that you're at the Admin Center-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n224\n00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYou now have users, home, groups,\n\n225\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:40.254\nresources, billing, support,\nsettings, setup, reports, and help,\n\n226\n00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:46.015\nand of course the Admin Center\nis down here at the very bottom.\n\n227\n00:13:46.015 --> 00:13:50.710\nAll of these are, I mean that's still\nquite a lot to have to search through.\n\n228\n00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.275\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not really helping me.\n\n229\n00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:54.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I might use any kind of search feature\n\n230\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.130\nif they have one.\n\n231\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.460\nOther than that,\nI'd probably give it to the Admin Center.\n\n232\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's what you would think, right?\n\n233\n00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.210\nBut this is where it becomes\na little bit more unusual.\n\n234\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.300\nDepending on which product\nthat you're using you've gotta\n\n235\n00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.290\nkind of do a couple of different things.\n\n236\n00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.890\nSo let's say that what\nwe're gonna do of course\n\n237\n00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.260\nis that we're gonna learn something just\nlike we have throughout the entire series.\n\n238\n00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.390\nEverything revolves pretty\nmuch back to SharePoint, okay?\n\n239\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.990\nIn Office 365 when it comes down to it,\nyou think whether we're crawling\n\n240\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.350\nin Exchange, or\nwhether we're crawling in OneDrive for\n\n241\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.830\nBusiness we're going select\nthose individuals to do that.\n\n242\n00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.160\nBut where it really comes back\ndown to this SharePoint again\n\n243\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.030\nwhich is strange to me but\nthat's the way we do it.\n\n244\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.490\nSo we select SharePoint and\n\n245\n00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:43.400\nonce we're actually in SharePoint in the\nAdmin Center this is where we scroll down.\n\n246\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.430\nAnd we look for the search feature.\n\n247\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.830\nSo back to the original point\nhere of what we're looking for.\n\n248\n00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.960\nSo this is where I think that, you\n\n249\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.340\nsometimes the scope of exams get so-\n&gt;&gt; A little bit too broad, yeah.\n\n250\n00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.850\n&gt;&gt; And now whereas like, the challenge\nis not what needs to be done anymore.\n\n251\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.880\nIt's like, where the heck do you find it?\n\n252\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.090\nThat's really the big challenge.\n\n253\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.082\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft, they love those, with\nthe least administrative effort because\n\n254\n00:15:13.082 --> 00:15:15.982\nthere's actually six ways in which you\ncan do this, but we're looking for\n\n255\n00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:17.148\nthe way that we think is best.\n\n256\n00:15:17.148 --> 00:15:18.939\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n257\n00:15:18.939 --> 00:15:20.490\n&gt;&gt; Dude, tell me which one is right.\n\n258\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.840\n&gt;&gt; So, look at this Daniel.\n\n259\n00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:28.037\nEven with the search [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That really helped.\n\n260\n00:15:28.037 --> 00:15:29.441\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you narrowed it down for me,\n\n261\n00:15:29.441 --> 00:15:30.110\nI appreciate it.\n\n262\n00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.519\n&gt;&gt; I did, yeah,\nwe did narrow it down to the last-\n\n263\n00:15:32.519 --> 00:15:33.416\n&gt;&gt; 3,000, right?\n\n264\n00:15:33.416 --> 00:15:35.572\n&gt;&gt; 12 or 13, 14-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n265\n00:15:35.572 --> 00:15:37.035\n&gt;&gt; You know, different ones.\n\n266\n00:15:37.035 --> 00:15:41.402\nLook at that, yep, there it is,\nand not in alphabetical order.\n\n267\n00:15:41.402 --> 00:15:42.520\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz that would have been easy.\n\n269\n00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n270\n00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:49.535\nIt's actually the very last one that we\nneed, which is Crawl Log Permissions.\n\n271\n00:15:49.535 --> 00:15:52.027\nSo, go figure, of all the things,\n\n272\n00:15:52.027 --> 00:15:56.363\nthey really didn't make this\nparticular way to make it easy.\n\n273\n00:15:56.363 --> 00:15:59.550\nI think most of us though,\nwe would probably have searched for\n\n274\n00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.570\nanything In alphabetical order and\nbeing able to find it.\n\n275\n00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:08.490\nBut out of alphabetical order, it becomes\na little bit more challenging like this.\n\n276\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.440\nSo I'm going to select\nCrawl Log Permissions here, maybe.\n\n277\n00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.560\nI click on it, apparently,\nI had to be out of zoom to do so.\n\n278\n00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.347\nAnd in a moment, we'll see our options\nthat are available to us to be able to do\n\n279\n00:16:22.347 --> 00:16:24.210\nthis Crawl Log Permissions.\n\n280\n00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.280\nNow without setting this,\nwe can't crawl, which-\n\n281\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:27.942\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense, yeah.\n\n282\n00:16:27.942 --> 00:16:30.656\n&gt;&gt; Makes eDiscovery fairly useless.\n\n283\n00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.920\nSo of course, I was waiting,\nthere we go, finally.\n\n284\n00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.450\nI was like, man, this thing,\nis it really gonna ever come up?\n\n285\n00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.615\n&gt;&gt; Did you click-click it?\n\n286\n00:16:36.615 --> 00:16:39.350\nBecause you can't just click,\nyou gotta click-click.\n\n287\n00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.564\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, apparently double-click times,\n\n288\n00:16:41.564 --> 00:16:44.090\neven though it says that\nit's doing something.\n\n289\n00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.700\nAnd the great thing is,\nit's not really a ton of options.\n\n290\n00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.847\nYou would think that as easy as this is,\nthey could've put this and\n\n291\n00:16:51.847 --> 00:16:54.230\nten others all on one line or one page.\n\n292\n00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:59.920\nBut no, look, isn't that diminutive\nterms of all the things right here?\n\n293\n00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.570\nBut there it is.\n\n294\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.547\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, this is Microsoft\nwe're talking about right here,\n\n295\n00:17:02.547 --> 00:17:03.840\nthey're the king of the wizards, right?\n\n296\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.561\nYou go on any server software,\nyou try to install a role or a whatever,\n\n297\n00:17:07.561 --> 00:17:11.930\nthere's a wizard guides you through every\nsingle step, gives you every detail.\n\n298\n00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.704\nYou think that they would have thrown\na wizard on top of something as complex as\n\n299\n00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:16.435\neDiscovery.\n\n300\n00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:18.229\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But they, in their infinite wisdom,\n\n301\n00:17:18.229 --> 00:17:19.520\ndecided against that apparently.\n\n302\n00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for all we know,\nthey're working on it right now.\n\n303\n00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.490\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n304\n00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm serious.\n\n305\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:23.898\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They may be working on that.\n\n306\n00:17:23.898 --> 00:17:24.870\n&gt;&gt; They need to.\n\n307\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.780\n&gt;&gt; Because some of the things that, when I\nfirst started working with the Office 365,\n\n308\n00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.818\nit was really challenging just to\nget the synchronization between your\n\n309\n00:17:33.818 --> 00:17:38.160\nn-premises Active Directory and\nAzure Active Directory synced up.\n\n310\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.100\nBut today, it's a bit easier,\nit really doesn't require a lot.\n\n311\n00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.560\nIt used to be where even if you didn't\ncapitalize it and then you capitalize it,\n\n312\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.540\nit actually created two different domains.\n\n313\n00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.630\nEven though they were identical,\nit was so strange.\n\n314\n00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.970\nBut now, they've fixed that and\neverything is good to go.\n\n315\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.229\n&gt;&gt; It's a work in progress, right?\n\n316\n00:17:55.229 --> 00:18:00.220\n&gt;&gt; But, yeah, this is where you go,\nman, as hidden, as buried as it is,\n\n317\n00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.880\nmaybe they really don't\nwant you doing this.\n\n318\n00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.890\nBut when it comes down to it,\nit's pretty much right here.\n\n319\n00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.980\nNotice you do not get\nthe chance to do anything else.\n\n320\n00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.128\nIt's not saying, you can grant read and\nwrite permissions, or read and\n\n321\n00:18:14.128 --> 00:18:15.490\nexecute permissions.\n\n322\n00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.855\nIt just says, you're gonna do one thing,\nwhich is write persmissions,\n\n323\n00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:22.290\nread permissions, excuse me,\nbefore I say that completely wrong again.\n\n324\n00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:27.920\nGrant users read access to crawl\nlog information for this tenant.\n\n325\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.510\nSo we're no longer talking about\nan individual site or a single product.\n\n326\n00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.720\nIt will do it across\nthe entire tenancy itself.\n\n327\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.210\nAnd that is key if I want\nto enable that to go on.\n\n328\n00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.520\nSo let me select that, and\nin a moment, there we go.\n\n329\n00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.980\nAnd a nice little success or\nsomething would be nice.\n\n330\n00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.346\nBut the only thing you can do is just\ngo back and check that it's in there.\n\n331\n00:18:50.346 --> 00:18:51.156\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that it's still in there.\n\n332\n00:18:51.156 --> 00:18:52.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty much it.\n\n333\n00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.080\nSo that is a big part\nof what we have to do.\n\n334\n00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.020\nSo we now have, of course, pretty much\nall the proper permissions in SharePoint.\n\n335\n00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.760\nSo remember that there's three of them,\nright?\n\n336\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.130\nWe have to have the ownership\npermission on the site.\n\n337\n00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.065\nAnd each site that we really\nare going to be making sure that we\n\n338\n00:19:08.065 --> 00:19:10.548\nget everything that we need, right?\n\n339\n00:19:10.548 --> 00:19:13.720\nSo in other words, which site do\nwe want to be able to do that?\n\n340\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.790\nAnd that's gonna be our eDiscovery sites,\npretty much, is what we're gonna have.\n\n341\n00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.492\nThen, we also, of course, have to make\nsure that we already have the site\n\n342\n00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:23.870\ncollection administrator permissions\nalso assigned there too.\n\n343\n00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.828\nAnd usually that's done, once we make that\npart of that eDiscovery owners, usually,\n\n344\n00:19:28.828 --> 00:19:33.260\nthose also, by default, become the site\ncollection administrator as well.\n\n345\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:38.550\nBut then, we also need these read\npermissions for the crawl logs as well.\n\n346\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:42.813\nNow once we're done with that,\nas far as eDiscovery goes,\n\n347\n00:19:42.813 --> 00:19:47.780\nthe permissions now switch on over for\nus into the realm of Exchange.\n\n348\n00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.670\nAnd the reason why we're doing\nExchange instead of everything.\n\n349\n00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.912\nNow if we actually had turned on for\nsources, right?\n\n350\n00:19:53.912 --> 00:19:58.509\nExchange, SharePoint and\nOneDrive for Business,\n\n351\n00:19:58.509 --> 00:20:06.110\nwe'd have to go into each one of them and\nalso give the permissions that we need.\n\n352\n00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:10.240\nBut we only chose Exchange as our example\nhere, that we're gonna only hunt for\n\n353\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.630\ninformation through Exchange\nis what we've said here, okay?\n\n354\n00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:20.260\nSo this time, I need to go into\nthe Exchange PowerShell itself to do this.\n\n355\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.560\nNow, when we start to see this,\nwhat are we actually going to do?\n\n356\n00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:28.366\nWe wanna make sure that we're allowing\nthe members of that security group,\n\n357\n00:20:28.366 --> 00:20:30.094\nthe eDiscovery Managers,\n\n358\n00:20:30.094 --> 00:20:35.051\nto be able to use that eDiscovery Center\nthat we created inside of SharePoint to\n\n359\n00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:40.580\nsearch through all the mailboxes to be\nable to place them on hold if we need to.\n\n360\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.940\nAnd of course, to be able to export\nthose searches if we need to as well.\n\n361\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.140\nSo all of that can be done,\nfrom the GUI, it's relatively easy.\n\n362\n00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.810\nLet's go into our Exchange Center here.\n\n363\n00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.380\nSo I'm gonna select Admin and\nthen Exchange.\n\n364\n00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:01.067\nAnd once we see this, when we start\nto get into Exchange, at this point,\n\n365\n00:21:01.067 --> 00:21:06.560\nonce I'm actually in the Exchange Admin\nCenter, I'm going to select Permissions.\n\n366\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:15.590\nAnd once we have the permissions,\nnotice that, in this group, look at that.\n\n367\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.180\nYou have Discovery Management.\n\n368\n00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:23.910\nSo inside of Exchange, in that\nDiscovery Management, I need to edit.\n\n369\n00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.666\nAnd it is here that I\nwould scroll down and\n\n370\n00:21:29.666 --> 00:21:34.230\nI would add my eDiscovery Managers here,\nokay?\n\n371\n00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:39.200\nFairly easy, very much able to do\nwithout a lot of hassle, right?\n\n372\n00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.811\nSo the great thing is, you can find\nthat one on your own relatively easy,\n\n373\n00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:44.880\nshould be good.\n\n374\n00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.780\nBut you've gotta remember how to get here.\n\n375\n00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:52.320\nSo you really didn't need me too much for\nthat, but at least you know where to go.\n\n376\n00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.000\nLet's go ahead and\nclear the screen out here.\n\n377\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.564\nAnd let me verify that I am still\nconnected to the PowerShell online\n\n378\n00:21:59.564 --> 00:22:00.468\nbefore I go.\n\n379\n00:22:00.468 --> 00:22:04.320\nAnd yep, I'm still connected,\nit's still open, which is what I need.\n\n380\n00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.180\nWe need to also go through PowerShell\nhere to get us into that group as well.\n\n381\n00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:14.535\nSo for us,\nit's gonna be Add RoleGroupMember,\n\n382\n00:22:14.535 --> 00:22:18.713\ndo identity, and this is gonna be that\n\n383\n00:22:18.713 --> 00:22:23.820\nDiscovery Management\nthat we just looked at.\n\n384\n00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:34.760\nNow, I simply say what\nthe membership is going to be.\n\n385\n00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.635\nSo I just simply type in Member, and then,\n\n386\n00:22:38.635 --> 00:22:43.710\nthe name of that group,\neDiscovery and, oops, Mgrs.\n\n387\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.158\nAnd once I do that,\nit's gonna ask me, of course, for\n\n388\n00:22:53.158 --> 00:22:57.200\npermissions or for\nmy credentials to do this.\n\n389\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.030\nAnd as long as I typed it in correctly,\n\n390\n00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.760\nKinda gotta zoom out every\nonce in a while to do that.\n\n391\n00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.199\nSo now you're seeing where it's\ncommand creating a new session for\n\n392\n00:23:14.199 --> 00:23:17.240\nimplicit remoting of\nthe Add RoleGroupMember command.\n\n393\n00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.790\nSo it's gonna just take a little\nbit of time here to add that in.\n\n394\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.294\nAnd once we're done with this,\n\n395\n00:23:22.294 --> 00:23:25.310\ndepending on the amount of time\nthat it takes to add this in here.\n\n396\n00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.409\nIt shouldn't be too long,\nbut every time I say that,\n\n397\n00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:28.852\nit's taking way longer-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:23:28.852 --> 00:23:29.907\n&gt;&gt; Than I ever expect it to.\n\n399\n00:23:29.907 --> 00:23:32.956\nBut the great thing is,\nit just finished up here, okay?\n\n400\n00:23:32.956 --> 00:23:37.955\nSo now, if I need to verify it, This time,\n\n401\n00:23:37.955 --> 00:23:40.934\ninstead of add or set, [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n402\n00:23:40.934 --> 00:23:43.115\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna get RoleGroupMember.\n\n403\n00:23:47.842 --> 00:23:54.468\nAnd with the identity,\nDiscovery Management,\n\n404\n00:23:56.639 --> 00:23:58.665\nAnd now we can see, there it is,\n\n405\n00:23:58.665 --> 00:24:01.760\nthe eDiscovery Managers\nhave now been added in.\n\n406\n00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.084\nTo that particular group.\n\n407\n00:24:04.084 --> 00:24:08.725\nSo, now we have the clear ability,\nto ensure that all the permissions\n\n408\n00:24:08.725 --> 00:24:12.421\nwe needed set for their source,\nas well as SharePoint,\n\n409\n00:24:12.421 --> 00:24:17.378\nwhere the information logs are gonna\nbe pretty much gathered and kept, and\n\n410\n00:24:17.378 --> 00:24:21.783\nthen we also have the ability to\nplace things on hold, you name it,\n\n411\n00:24:21.783 --> 00:24:25.520\nthis is what we actually\nneeded to have happen.\n\n412\n00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.080\nNow, in this particular series,\nwe're not going into running\n\n413\n00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:35.650\nthrough an actual entirety\nof an e-discovery set up.\n\n414\n00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:40.186\nIf you want to do that, make sure you\ncheck out the Exchange show, the 70-345,\n\n415\n00:24:40.186 --> 00:24:43.336\nwhere Brian Svidergol and I,\nwe go through that process and\n\n416\n00:24:43.336 --> 00:24:47.620\nshow you how to run that e-discovery,\nas well and you all should check that out,\n\n417\n00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.086\ncuz there's a lot more\nPowerShell to do that.\n\n418\n00:24:50.086 --> 00:24:54.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Than what I have here too.\n\n419\n00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:58.800\nSo, in that one this is only about the\nconfiguration inside of Office 365 you're\n\n420\n00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.420\ngonna do that, and there's some basic\nsetup, it's really five or six steps, but\n\n421\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.040\nit does take some time and\n\n422\n00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.080\nsome understanding of the logic,\nto make it work the way we want to.\n\n423\n00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.330\nThere's only one last cleanup that\nI want us to be able to do, and\n\n424\n00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.060\nit's because of some net that bugs\nme every once in a while, and\n\n425\n00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.770\nlet's see if I can show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n426\n00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.428\nEvery time I think I can do this,\nall of a sudden it changes up,\n\n427\n00:25:21.428 --> 00:25:24.494\nlet me get back out here just for\na second, we got just a few minutes, and\n\n428\n00:25:24.494 --> 00:25:26.206\nthis is one last thing that I want to do.\n\n429\n00:25:26.206 --> 00:25:31.691\nI'm gonna click on Mail icon here for\na moment, to bring up the email.\n\n430\n00:25:34.207 --> 00:25:37.535\nNow, you actually see that there's\na couple of emails, if I select New.\n\n431\n00:25:40.954 --> 00:25:44.698\nAll right, notice here something Daniel,\nwhen I first started to type this out, and\n\n432\n00:25:44.698 --> 00:25:46.650\nlet's say I wanted to send an email.\n\n433\n00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.670\nLook at this group that's\nactually right here,\n\n434\n00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:54.890\nokay, so it's automatically inside\nof the organization's address book.\n\n435\n00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:59.490\nNow, not saying you can't use it, okay,\nnot saying it won't actually make it\n\n436\n00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.080\ninto a distribution group and\nsend it out to everybody, but\n\n437\n00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.700\nwhat are the chances that an accidentally\nsomebody in my Office 365 organization\n\n438\n00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.540\nhits this, and they just start sending\nrandom emails, just by accident.\n\n439\n00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.180\n&gt;&gt; It's possible.\n\n440\n00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.300\n&gt;&gt; It is possible, right?\n\n441\n00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.280\nThe very fact that it doesn't\nneed to be there, okay,\n\n442\n00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.750\nit just really doesn't need to be there.\n\n443\n00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.580\n&gt;&gt; It's not really being used\nas a distribution group.\n\n444\n00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.770\n&gt;&gt; Right, so why have it out there, so\nthat somebody can go, what is this about?\n\n445\n00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.920\nLet me see what happens here if I do this,\n\n446\n00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.468\nI don't want it to be searched in\ndirectory, I don't wanna do any of that.\n\n447\n00:26:28.468 --> 00:26:32.210\nSo, let's start change that up, and\n\n448\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.850\nlet me go ahead and leave this page,\nget back over here.\n\n449\n00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.590\nWe'll go back into our\nExchange Admin Center,\n\n450\n00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:44.540\nand the great thing is a simple check\nmark, but it's sign that really does clean\n\n451\n00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:49.500\neverything up at the very end, and most of\nthe time, at least I know I appreciate it,\n\n452\n00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.060\nbecause I start wondering like why\nis that actually like out there.\n\n453\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.527\nSo I'm just gonna select Exchange.\n\n454\n00:26:58.331 --> 00:27:01.977\nAnd once we get into\nthe Exchange Admin Center,\n\n455\n00:27:01.977 --> 00:27:06.811\nI'm going to look for\ngroups underneath the recipients here,\n\n456\n00:27:06.811 --> 00:27:11.390\nso if I select, oops, you see,\ngroups under recipients.\n\n457\n00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.060\nAnd now there's the e-discovery manager,\nso\n\n458\n00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.050\nlet me click on the little pencil for\nedit.\n\n459\n00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:23.390\nScroll out, all I need to do is, Hide\nthis group from the address list, and you\n\n460\n00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:27.260\ncan see, If you select this option, the\ngroup won't appear in your organization's\n\n461\n00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.730\naddress book and other lists, but groups\nwill still receive email sent to it.\n\n462\n00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:36.650\nSo, as long as it's no big deal if\nemails get sent to it too much, but\n\n463\n00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:41.560\nwe don't want somebody including that,\nand just wondering why is this out there.\n\n464\n00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.280\nSo, at least just putting that check box\nthere will help you, to hide this group\n\n465\n00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.500\nfrom the address list, it just makes\nit a little bit cleaner overall and\n\n466\n00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.350\neverything that we do, but that's just\nkind of a personal thing as I saw,\n\n467\n00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:57.190\nthat's actually a good thing for\nus to do at the very end, especially\n\n468\n00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:01.980\nif we're going to be administrating us\nunderstanding that that's a part of it.\n\n469\n00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.152\nPeople not just going, hey, every 15\nminutes you know Daniel going, hey who's\n\n470\n00:28:05.152 --> 00:28:08.235\nthe e-discovery managers, I was like\nthat's really not involving you at all,\n\n471\n00:28:08.235 --> 00:28:09.604\nwhat does it matter,\n&gt;&gt; Nobody.\n\n472\n00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:12.590\n&gt;&gt; Who they are, yeah, so, but\nat the same time, take it out,\n\n473\n00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.430\nthey're not even going to notice it,\nthat's the key.\n\n474\n00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:17.600\n&gt;&gt; That's right, if it's not there for\nit to be a problem,\n\n475\n00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.380\nthen it won't be a problem.\n\n476\n00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.010\nRonnie, thanks for adding your personal\npro-philosophy on top of this whole entire\n\n477\n00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.697\nthing of doing e-discovery, obviously,\nit's a bit of a involved procedure,\n\n478\n00:28:27.697 --> 00:28:32.470\nright, and it takes a little bit of\nknow-how, understanding what to do next,\n\n479\n00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.911\nand why you're gonna do what next,\nand of course having your typos.\n\n480\n00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:37.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Out of the way,\n\n481\n00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.070\nto get those PowerShell\ncommands to work correctly.\n\n482\n00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:44.991\nRonnie is a fantastic example of\nshowing you how to type incorrectly.\n\n483\n00:28:44.991 --> 00:28:46.738\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n484\n00:28:46.738 --> 00:28:48.583\n&gt;&gt; You don't do what Ronnie does\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n485\n00:28:48.583 --> 00:28:51.443\n&gt;&gt; The first time, you do what Ronnie\ndoes the second or third time,\n\n486\n00:28:51.443 --> 00:28:52.958\neasily, then everything works.\n\n487\n00:28:52.958 --> 00:28:55.809\nRonnie, thanks so much for\nwalking us through e-discovery,\n\n488\n00:28:55.809 --> 00:28:58.174\nI know it's been a trudging\nbit of monstrosity, but\n\n489\n00:28:58.174 --> 00:29:01.265\nwe've finally made it to the end,\nand we have you to thank for that.\n\n490\n00:29:01.265 --> 00:29:02.944\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have you guys to thank for\n\n491\n00:29:02.944 --> 00:29:06.661\nhanging in there with us, thank you so\nmuch, but it looks like it is time for\n\n492\n00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:10.100\nus to sign off, For ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel

greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:17.640\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.460\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.440\nAnd in today's episode,\nwhat's making it so\n\n10\n00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.590\ngreat is that we are stepping\nback into our 70-347 series and\n\n11\n00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.150\njoining us in the studio yet again,\nour good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.180\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.980\nI'm glad to have you again.\n\n14\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you again, Daniel, for\nhaving me back in the studio as we now\n\n15\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.810\ncontinue to take a look at other\nelements inside of Office 365,\n\n16\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.670\nwe've spent a bit of time talking\nabout collaboration services and\n\n17\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.710\nin the last few episodes, we took a lot\nof time here taking a look at eDiscovery,\n\n18\n00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.070\nnow we're moving into the realm\nof well Exchange, right?\n\n19\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.200\nReally mailboxes and\nmanaging those mailboxes and\n\n20\n00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.360\nthat's what we're gonna begin with today,\nespecially email addresses.\n\n21\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.590\nWhat we wanna do, of course, is look at\nthe idea here of configuring additional\n\n22\n00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.080\nemail addresses to what we\nhave in existence right now.\n\n23\n00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.390\nAnd this is something that you're\ngoing to experience throughout\n\n24\n00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.740\nthe life cycle of your organization\nas it continues to grow and\n\n25\n00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.910\nchange and\ndo other things that may end up happening.\n\n26\n00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.560\nSo for\nexample probably the most common one,\n\n27\n00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.010\nprobably one that you're gonna\nexperience right at some time or another\n\n28\n00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.420\nis that you're gonna have a user that has\nhad their email address for a long time.\n\n29\n00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.040\nBut now all of a sudden,\n\n30\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.180\nlet's say that someone ends up\ngetting married, their name changes.\n\n31\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.930\nAnd now inside your organization, the\nemail address also normally changes to,\n\n32\n00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.570\nwell, how do you do that without\nactually creating another email or\n\n33\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.470\nanother mailbox and doing everything else\nthat you have there that's happening.\n\n34\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.990\nYou might be saying, well,\nwhat's the big deal?\n\n35\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.790\nWe're just making a email box for her,\nshe'll be off and ready to go, or\n\n36\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.070\nhim if he changes her name for\none reason or another, and you're fine.\n\n37\n00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.100\nWell, what happens if you end up\ndeleting the previous email box and\n\n38\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.370\npeople are still sending\nemails to the old address?\n\n39\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.600\nWell, that doesn't work either.\n\n40\n00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.840\nSo we definitely need to take\na look at some of the situations\n\n41\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.290\nthat we are going to encounter when\nit comes down to email addresses and\n\n42\n00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.240\nsome of the things that we have\nto actually think about which is,\n\n43\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.160\nof course, how do we do this without\nbreaking the things that already exist.\n\n44\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.020\nI think that's kind of the key here,\nit is what we're talking about.\n\n45\n00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.760\nSo, of course, there's a couple of\nways that we have to think about it.\n\n46\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.720\nAnd it again involves PowerShell which\nis kind of the big one on the exam.\n\n47\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.070\nAnd, of course, the web UI.\n\n48\n00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.020\nOn the web UI side, I'm gonna kind of\nleave that alone this particular time.\n\n49\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.240\nBecause I believe that at this\npoint you can probably figure out\n\n50\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.310\nhow to do this fairly easily.\n\n51\n00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.050\nWe'll go in there and\nwe'll show you where to verify and stuff.\n\n52\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.990\nBut you'll see along the lines yeah,\nthis is where I would configure that.\n\n53\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.550\nIt makes a little bit more sense.\n\n54\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.950\nBut on the other stuff\nwhere I showed both,\n\n55\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.220\nit was probably more than likely\nbecause it was not as intuitive.\n\n56\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.080\nIt took a lot more for you to go I\nwould not have found that here or\n\n57\n00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.050\nI would not have even\nthought about looking here.\n\n58\n00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.120\nBut on the email side, you're probably\ngonna see it's relatively more intuitive.\n\n59\n00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.720\nSo when it comes out, there's a couple\nthings we have to just keep in\n\n60\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.436\nmind before we move forward\nwith saying these change,\n\n61\n00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:30.798\nmaking the changes happen,\nespecially with Office 365, so\n\n62\n00:03:30.798 --> 00:03:36.557\nthere's no need two configurations that\ngo on Daniel we start using Office 365.\n\n63\n00:03:36.557 --> 00:03:43.353\nOne of them is, of course, just playing\nout everything is 100% Exchange online.\n\n64\n00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:45.636\nSo that means that your\norganization has said,\n\n65\n00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:48.820\nI'm not keeping an Exchange\nserver right here online.\n\n66\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.480\nWe're just gonna make sure everybody\nis actually up in the cloud.\n\n67\n00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.720\nAnd that is an easier manager.\n\n68\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.470\nEven right here at IT Pro TV,\nthat's what we do.\n\n69\n00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.090\nAs we don't have an exchange\nserver right here,\n\n70\n00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.530\nwe're not managing anything\non premises at this point.\n\n71\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.590\nEverything is up in the cloud,\nand we like it.\n\n72\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.000\nIt works fairly well.\n\n73\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.780\nWe're not having to actually deal with\ndata or loss or anything like that.\n\n74\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.780\nEverything is done that way.\n\n75\n00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.839\nBut organizations do not tend to\njust [NOISE] one day they've got\n\n76\n00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:21.909\non premises server and then tomorrow,\nnope we are all online.\n\n77\n00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.340\nIt doesn't happen that way.\n\n78\n00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.975\nSo usually we end up with\na hybrid at least for\n\n79\n00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:30.819\na period of time,\nif not forever at that time.\n\n80\n00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.380\nAnd that's what ends up happening,\nis now that we have maybe a on\n\n81\n00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.858\npremises Exchange server as well\nas that also possibly means,\n\n82\n00:04:39.858 --> 00:04:44.673\nwhich is probably more likely what\nhappens is that you also have an on\n\n83\n00:04:44.673 --> 00:04:49.083\npremises active directory\ninfrastructure setup there too.\n\n84\n00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:53.405\nAnd what you're doing now is you're\nstarting to do what we call directory\n\n85\n00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:57.870\nsynchronization with your on premises\ninfrastructure to the Office 365\n\n86\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.500\ncloud as well.\n\n87\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.860\nWell, if we're gonna do that, right,\nthat actually involves a little bit of\n\n88\n00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.070\na different type of command that\nyou'll have to be able to run.\n\n89\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.310\nAnd also, when you do something like that,\nyou'll also end up\n\n90\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.140\nhaving to run all of the PowerShell\nstuff that we're gonna show you.\n\n91\n00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.410\nAnd there's not a ton of commands, but\n\n92\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.990\nthere are a few that you wanna\nmake sure that you understand.\n\n93\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.400\nYou'll need to run them from the Exchange\non premises Powershell command there.\n\n94\n00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.910\nSo you'll get access to that EAC on\nyour Exchange on premises server.\n\n95\n00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.900\nBut at the same time, you'll also see\nthere's going to be an Exchange Powershell\n\n96\n00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.320\nlink right there for you to also use.\n\n97\n00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.456\nSo anything that we end up showing you for\nthat particular part,\n\n98\n00:05:40.456 --> 00:05:42.500\nthat's where you'll run that instead.\n\n99\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.686\nNow, I don't have that setup for\nright now, and\n\n100\n00:05:45.686 --> 00:05:49.266\nthat's because in\nthe previous 70-346 class,\n\n101\n00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:54.245\nwe did see the setup of the active\ndirectory synchronization and everything\n\n102\n00:05:54.245 --> 00:05:59.177\nthat was involved in making sure that\nthat worked the way that we needed to.\n\n103\n00:05:59.177 --> 00:06:02.300\nBut on this one, we've been, pretty much,\njust talking about the services.\n\n104\n00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.850\nBut you do need to know\nthat those are different.\n\n105\n00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.450\nAnd you want to make sure that\nyou understand that context.\n\n106\n00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.440\nSo, for example,\nDaniel as we prepare for the exam.\n\n107\n00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.500\nYou can guess that the commands that\nyou'll generally end up seeing,\n\n108\n00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.130\nit really is gonna depend on what you see\nin that kind of paragraph thing right?\n\n109\n00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:26.030\nYou're running this on-premises or you're\ntotally 100% exchange online, you've\n\n110\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.810\ngot to change your thinking and not say,\nthis command will work here and there.\n\n111\n00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.020\nIt doesn't, especially in\nsomething we're about to do here.\n\n112\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.120\nSo it's an important fact that we\nneed to make sure that we zoom in on.\n\n113\n00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've got to remember,\n\n114\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.830\njust because things are similar doesn't\nmean that they're exactly the same.\n\n115\n00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.103\nSo if you're in a specific environment\nyou're in a hybrid environment,\n\n116\n00:06:45.103 --> 00:06:48.587\nyou have to be able to work within certain\nenvironment where the specific steps\n\n117\n00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:50.517\nwhen that is the case and\nso on and so forth.\n\n118\n00:06:50.517 --> 00:06:54.615\nIf you're exchanged online only or\nif you're completely on premise\n\n119\n00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:57.509\nchange which keeping that\nkind of data as bare but\n\n120\n00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:02.790\nworking with it is easy where you have\nthe opposite effect with exchanged online.\n\n121\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.840\nLet's say you've made it\npretty easy to administer, but\n\n122\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.030\nyou don't have to do any of the upkeep.\n\n123\n00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.580\nThey do all that stuff for you.\n\n124\n00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.190\nSo depending on which\nenvironment you're in,\n\n125\n00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.610\nyou're gonna have to set your skill set\nappropriately to answer your questions.\n\n126\n00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.435\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's gonna be key.\n\n127\n00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.975\nAnd again, I can't reveal too\nmuch about what's on the exam.\n\n128\n00:07:19.975 --> 00:07:22.705\nBut I can tell you that you've gotta\npay attention to that context that\n\n129\n00:07:22.705 --> 00:07:23.555\nthey give you.\n\n130\n00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:26.625\nIf you don't, you end up seeing the\ncommand that you think will work, because\n\n131\n00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:30.665\nyou'll logically walk through the command\nand go, yeah no, that's exactly right.\n\n132\n00:07:30.665 --> 00:07:33.450\nAnd then you forget to actually look\nat the very beginning when they say,\n\n133\n00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.760\nyou're running a hybrid environment or\nyour Exchange Online is doing this,\n\n134\n00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.250\nmake sure you check that out, all right?\n\n135\n00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.000\nIt's an emphasis here that makes the\ndifference, and then that's the key, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.540\nSo everything that we're gonna show you\nat the beginning is pretty much gonna be\n\n137\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.000\njust all Exchange Online stuff.\n\n138\n00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.764\nAnd then, we'll show you one or\ntwo commands.\n\n139\n00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:57.172\nWe're not gonna run them because I don't\nhave the on-premises Directory sync, or\n\n140\n00:07:57.172 --> 00:08:00.895\nanything like that setup, but\nat least you'll know the beginnings and\n\n141\n00:08:00.895 --> 00:08:02.773\nwhat that will end up looking like.\n\n142\n00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:05.981\nSo always think about those\ncontexts that you're put in and\n\n143\n00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:07.850\nwhich one you should run.\n\n144\n00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.670\nAny time that there is administrative\nchanges, especially with the mailboxes.\n\n145\n00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.070\nIf you're gonna do that, you're gonna\nfind out something with Exchange Online.\n\n146\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.440\nYou go and make some type of change to\na mailbox, it's gonna give you a nice, not\n\n147\n00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.210\na nice, it's gonna give you a big warning\nin kind of a yellowish, or a red box.\n\n148\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.820\nThat says, hey, this stuff that\nyou're trying to do to manipulate and\n\n149\n00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.010\nchange this,\nyou gotta do it on the premises.\n\n150\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.670\nIn your Active Directory premises or\non your Exchange premises instead.\n\n151\n00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.840\nIt's not gonna allow you\nto do it in the cloud.\n\n152\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.360\nWell, you're not gonna have that reminder\non the exam, so just kind of be aware.\n\n153\n00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.750\nThis one, when we start talking\nabout changing email addresses.\n\n154\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.730\nLet's say for example the default email\naddress, or the primary email address.\n\n155\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:58.270\nThis is something that we want to make\nsure that we can do when necessary,\n\n156\n00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.170\nand there's a couple of things\nthat we have to consider.\n\n157\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.800\nBecause the command is\nrelatively simple but\n\n158\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.830\nthere's options that you have to\npay attention to as you do this.\n\n159\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.897\nSo let's take a look at what I'm\ngo to look on my machine here,\n\n160\n00:09:11.897 --> 00:09:14.812\nwhich is of course gonna\nbe the PowerShell.\n\n161\n00:09:14.812 --> 00:09:18.970\nAnd I am connected in to\nExchange Online already.\n\n162\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.593\nSo if I do the get Get-PSSession,\n\n163\n00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:26.320\nthat way I can see, there it is,\nI'm still connected.\n\n164\n00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.852\nI am still in the open state and there it\nis, Microsoft Exchange, so I am connected.\n\n165\n00:09:30.852 --> 00:09:32.980\nEverything that I'm gonna do is\nonly gonna to the cloud, and\n\n166\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.700\nthat means I'm on Exchange only as\nwell up there on the Exchange Online.\n\n167\n00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.230\nNow let's go ahead and\nget a mailbox first.\n\n168\n00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.060\nI'm gonna do Get Mailbox, and\n\n169\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.930\nthis time we're just gonna\npull up the one for Lance.\n\n170\n00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.860\nNow it's gonna say hey,\ngive me some credentials.\n\n171\n00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.450\nAnd once again, my typing, Is the key.\n\n172\n00:09:58.273 --> 00:09:59.406\nOf course, I can't type it in.\n\n173\n00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:06.738\n[INAUDIBLE]\nTry it again.\n\n174\n00:10:06.738 --> 00:10:13.180\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.540\nSo now I'm just trying to show that,\nhey, everything is working.\n\n176\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.570\nI've got the mailbox right here for Lance.\n\n177\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.760\nI can actually see what\nwe're doing at this point.\n\n178\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.202\nNow for\nhis particular mailbox that he has,\n\n179\n00:10:24.202 --> 00:10:27.640\nlet's take a look at that through\nthe Exchange Admin Center.\n\n180\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.408\nSo if I come back to\nthe Exchange Admin Center I'm gonna select\n\n181\n00:10:32.408 --> 00:10:35.430\nthe recipients, Lance Bass here.\n\n182\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.510\nAnd here's his regular\ndefault email address, right?\n\n183\n00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.730\nPretty long, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.580\nCuz we hadn't changed it\nfrom the on Microsoft\n\n185\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.908\ndirectory that gives us access to that for\nfree.\n\n186\n00:10:46.908 --> 00:10:50.330\nWe can change that, but for\nright now we're just gonna leave it alone.\n\n187\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.010\nI'm going to click on the edit pencil.\n\n188\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.040\nFrom here, notice that I have,\n\n189\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.240\nwell, multiple options within\nLance's mailbox as well.\n\n190\n00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.280\nHis usage, his contact information,\norganization.\n\n191\n00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.930\nSince we're dealing with email addresses,\nlet's select email addresses right here.\n\n192\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.570\nAnd now, you can see that there's\nactually different types of addresses\n\n193\n00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.300\nthat are available to us.\n\n194\n00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.950\nEach email address type has\none default reply address.\n\n195\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.145\nThe default reply address\nis displayed in bold.\n\n196\n00:11:21.145 --> 00:11:23.238\nNow when you take a look at all of these,\n\n197\n00:11:23.238 --> 00:11:26.166\nnotice that all three of them\nare in bold for right now.\n\n198\n00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:31.502\nOne, of course, is for your SIP\nconnection, the other one is your mail,\n\n199\n00:11:31.502 --> 00:11:35.910\nand SPO, your SharePoint Online\nsite particular address.\n\n200\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.060\nAll that's actually right there for us.\n\n201\n00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.020\nSo it can answer in any one of those.\n\n202\n00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.040\nIf I were just doing this through the GUI,\nyou click on Add and there you go.\n\n203\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.878\nNow you actually do have an email\naddress that you can now type in.\n\n204\n00:11:49.878 --> 00:11:52.400\nAnd you can make this\nthe reply email address,\n\n205\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.290\nessentially also making it the default\nemail address at the same time.\n\n206\n00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.831\nSo it gives you that ability to do so\nif you want to, so\n\n207\n00:12:00.831 --> 00:12:03.324\nnot difficult from the GUI.\n\n208\n00:12:03.324 --> 00:12:07.645\nBut of course, like we've said\nbefore in previous episodes too,\n\n209\n00:12:07.645 --> 00:12:11.980\nusually though on the exam they\nlove testing from the PowerShell.\n\n210\n00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.130\nAnd there are a couple of different\nones that you're likely to see.\n\n211\n00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.537\nThat will get you the result\nthat you want to get, but\n\n212\n00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:23.070\nit may give you too much, more than\nyou want to deal with here, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.100\nSo let's go ahead and\ntalk about them as we do this.\n\n214\n00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.660\nSo usually, the fairly easy one\n\n215\n00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.860\nis to set the mailbox for Lance here.\n\n216\n00:12:38.778 --> 00:12:40.470\nAnd then all I have to\ndo is type in Lance.\n\n217\n00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.480\nAnd then the mailbox that I want it to\nactually turn in, or the email address,\n\n218\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.665\nexcuse me, that I want it to turn into.\n\n219\n00:12:48.665 --> 00:12:54.650\nWhich is gonna be Office,\nlet's just do officeprodemocode.com.\n\n220\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:58.322\nAll right, now if I hit Enter right here,\nI'm not gonna do it yet\n\n221\n00:12:58.322 --> 00:13:02.120\nbecause this may not be the one\nthat we want to be able to use.\n\n222\n00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.660\nBut it is one that you want to\nmake sure that you understand.\n\n223\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.440\nIt's not so much that this\ncan't do what we want it to do.\n\n224\n00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:17.150\nBut when we select the Set-Mailbox lance\nand just the email address, well this is\n\n225\n00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:23.220\nactually gonna setup that particular email\naddress, which is perfectly fine for us.\n\n226\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.510\nBut let me make sure I\nactually have that right,\n\n227\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.150\nyeah, I think that's actually right here.\n\n228\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.700\nWhen you actually do something like this,\nwhat should end up happening\n\n229\n00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:38.030\nis that the new email address is now going\nto turn into the default email address.\n\n230\n00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:42.452\nWhich is what we want, we want to change\nthat default, or that primary one.\n\n231\n00:13:42.452 --> 00:13:47.239\nThis particular old email\naddress which I showed you,\n\n232\n00:13:47.239 --> 00:13:52.036\nwhich was\nthe officeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n233\n00:13:52.036 --> 00:13:55.144\nThat will end up being\nwhat we call an alias, or\n\n234\n00:13:55.144 --> 00:13:59.770\na secondary email address,\nis what will end up happening.\n\n235\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.000\nAnd then all the other addresses\nthat we also have assigned here,\n\n236\n00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.370\nthis is the key,\nit will get removed, okay?\n\n237\n00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.920\nNow why is that important, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.800\nThat is important because even though\nit might get a secondary address,\n\n239\n00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.690\nremember we saw SIP and SPO?\n\n240\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.890\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n241\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, if those are tied to different\nservices, such as the phone or\n\n242\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.610\nphones that are connected in.\n\n243\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.560\nAnd of course, SharePoint, that's there.\n\n244\n00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.860\nAnd those get removed\nautomatically when you do this.\n\n245\n00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.315\nThat could cause some disruption\nof services, Daniel, you think?\n\n246\n00:14:35.315 --> 00:14:37.770\n&gt;&gt; They might,\nyou never know with these things, right?\n\n247\n00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.340\nYes, it's going to cause\ndisruption of services, so\n\n248\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.040\nthis is a very important fact.\n\n249\n00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.450\nIf we could, maybe even put some blinking\nlights around all this and warning signs,\n\n250\n00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.610\nmaybe a bell or a buzzer happening.\n\n251\n00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:52.765\nRemind yourself, make sure that you\nunderstand that this is happening.\n\n252\n00:14:52.765 --> 00:14:57.327\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's something that we\nwanna make sure that we definitely pay\n\n253\n00:14:57.327 --> 00:14:58.956\nattention to as I do that.\n\n254\n00:14:58.956 --> 00:15:01.023\nNow I just realised something,\nI typed in the command wrong so\n\n255\n00:15:01.023 --> 00:15:01.954\nlet's go back the screen.\n\n256\n00:15:01.954 --> 00:15:02.940\n&gt;&gt; I don't believe you.\n\n257\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.450\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; You never type a command wrong.\n\n258\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.870\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I even typed in a wrong here-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n259\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.177\n&gt;&gt; I was wondering,\n\n260\n00:15:07.177 --> 00:15:10.580\nI was like,\nwhy did that dash do a funny color?\n\n261\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.906\nThat's because I forgot, I need to\nactually change the email address and\n\n262\n00:15:14.906 --> 00:15:18.550\nthen I can do the lance@officeprodemoco,\nmaybe, democo.\n\n263\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.704\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n264\n00:15:19.704 --> 00:15:20.903\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n265\n00:15:20.903 --> 00:15:25.990\ncuz once I saw the two colors like, that's\nnot right, so I was looking at it like,\n\n266\n00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:30.180\nI forgot the actual little,\nyou know, option that was there.\n\n267\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:35.010\nSo this will give me that email address,\nbut it will wipe out those others.\n\n268\n00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.527\nThat could be problematic,right?\n\n269\n00:15:36.527 --> 00:15:43.840\nSo if you don't mind wiping out others,\nother services, have at it, there you go.\n\n270\n00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.829\nYou wanna make sure that you do pay\nattention when you do something like this\n\n271\n00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:48.960\ninstead.\n\n272\n00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.580\nSo that's a warning, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.346\nBecause I can see this,\nfor example, Daniel.\n\n274\n00:15:54.346 --> 00:15:58.781\nOn the exam, they might say, which of\nthe following is going to do this?\n\n275\n00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:01.026\nWell, if you select this one,\nit may do exactly that.\n\n276\n00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:04.599\nIt will replace the primary address,\nmake this the default.\n\n277\n00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:06.828\nThat does exactly what it says.\n\n278\n00:16:06.828 --> 00:16:10.081\nBut what if it tells you something like,\nmake sure you do this and\n\n279\n00:16:10.081 --> 00:16:12.620\nthat no services are disrupted?\n\n280\n00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.540\nWell, does this do that?\n\n281\n00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.570\nNo it disrupts quite a bit.\n\n282\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.210\nSo it may not be the one that you want,\nand\n\n283\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.256\nthat's why I wanted to\npoint that out as well.\n\n284\n00:16:24.256 --> 00:16:27.346\nSo when we start to take\na lot at something like this,\n\n285\n00:16:27.346 --> 00:16:30.650\nwe have to take a look at\nanother option instead.\n\n286\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.720\nAnd this is where we're gonna\njust change this up a little bit.\n\n287\n00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.380\nSo instead of set email addresses here,\nwhat I'm gonna do is\n\n288\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:45.590\nset what we'd call,\nwindows email address instead.\n\n289\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:50.310\nOnce I do that, now I can\n\n290\n00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.470\ntype in my lance@officeprodemoco.com,\nlike this.\n\n291\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.894\nAnd this one will actually do\nwhat we want it to do as well.\n\n292\n00:17:00.894 --> 00:17:05.970\nIt will make this the primary address,\nwhich is what we want instead.\n\n293\n00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.171\nAnd now the great thing is,\n\n294\n00:17:08.171 --> 00:17:14.018\nit will not get rid of the replaced\naddresses nor those other addresses.\n\n295\n00:17:14.018 --> 00:17:18.320\nSo the great thing is that means that\nthose addresses will be left in the order\n\n296\n00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.205\nthat I want to.\n\n297\n00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.493\nYou're probably wondering why, Ronnie,\n\n298\n00:17:20.493 --> 00:17:22.140\nwhy didn't you just press\nthe command on the other one?\n\n299\n00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.119\nBecause on those,\nthat SIP address, did we see that?\n\n300\n00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.950\nHold on a minute, let me make sure.\n\n301\n00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:32.150\nDaniel the chances of me recovering,\njust by thinking about and\n\n302\n00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.250\njust pressing that on a WIM.\n\n303\n00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.078\nIf you remember,\nI was looking at this here.\n\n304\n00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:39.448\nWhat are the chances that\nI'm gonna remember that SPO?\n\n305\n00:17:39.448 --> 00:17:41.125\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with slim to none.\n\n306\n00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:42.187\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n307\n00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:43.162\n&gt;&gt; That's my final answer.\n\n308\n00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:47.602\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nYeah, Daniel it's I'm definitely not\n\n309\n00:17:47.602 --> 00:17:50.845\ngonna be able to remember that.\n\n310\n00:17:50.845 --> 00:17:55.440\nI think even rain man might be challenged\nat this particular one that we see.\n\n311\n00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.750\nBut as a joke, right?\n\n312\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.280\nBut overall though,\nif I were to be like, yeah look at this.\n\n313\n00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.530\nAnd then I had to get back in here and\nget that for something else we were doing.\n\n314\n00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.670\nI probably wouldn't have recovered\nthat at all, ever at any point.\n\n315\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.150\nSo remember that when we\nstart doing stuff like this.\n\n316\n00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:14.228\nYou want to be careful as you start\nto see information like this.\n\n317\n00:18:14.228 --> 00:18:18.667\nSo don't always, make sure you read up\non this stuff as you start to do this.\n\n318\n00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:22.681\nBut on this one because I know\nwhat the result is gonna be, and\n\n319\n00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:25.060\nthat's gonna be key for you.\n\n320\n00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.057\nBefore you do this, is that you\nunderstand what the results are gonna be,\n\n321\n00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:30.291\nbefore you hit Enter.\n\n322\n00:18:30.291 --> 00:18:33.434\nSo on this one, I went ahead and\npressed Enter, cuz on this one,\n\n323\n00:18:33.434 --> 00:18:36.770\nit says it's not an accepted domain for\nmy organization.\n\n324\n00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.540\nIt's saying Ronnie,\nyou haven't actually purchased this one.\n\n325\n00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.253\nSo, and it's saying if you wanna go in and\ndo that,\n\n326\n00:18:42.253 --> 00:18:45.429\nyou have to change the other organization,\nwhich is fine.\n\n327\n00:18:45.429 --> 00:18:47.573\nWe're not really doing this at this point,\nbut\n\n328\n00:18:47.573 --> 00:18:50.841\nI'd have to come down to organization or\ndomain, wherever that is, and\n\n329\n00:18:50.841 --> 00:18:53.940\nactually be able to purchase\nthat domain for right now.\n\n330\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.540\nI haven't done that, and\nthat's why it's actually balking at me,\n\n331\n00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.650\nbecause it's not really\nan acceptable one it can find.\n\n332\n00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.637\nBut you kind of get the idea at least.\n\n333\n00:19:02.637 --> 00:19:04.857\nIs what you're looking for\n\n334\n00:19:04.857 --> 00:19:09.882\nis this one by comparison to one\nthat you normally would have.\n\n335\n00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:14.060\nSo, it is important that you understand\nwhat the differences are going to be\n\n336\n00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.080\nthere, when you select which\none you're actually doing.\n\n337\n00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.090\nAnd, once you have that in mind,\n\n338\n00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.650\nit's gonna be a lot easier when\nyou do face the exam to do this.\n\n339\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:29.230\nSo don't always take for granted that\nthe very first one that we kind of,\n\n340\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.500\nlet me see which one,\nwhere was it that we were doing this?\n\n341\n00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.310\nI actually kind of deleted it out,\ndidn't I?\n\n342\n00:19:36.822 --> 00:19:37.700\nYeah I deleted it out.\n\n343\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:43.032\nI was trying, it was email addresses.\n\n344\n00:19:43.032 --> 00:19:45.913\nLet me make sure that we\ncan see both of them here.\n\n345\n00:19:45.913 --> 00:19:47.760\nLet me clear the screen\ncuz it's looking ugly now.\n\n346\n00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.655\nSo remember that this one set mailbox, For\n\n347\n00:19:54.655 --> 00:19:57.770\nlance and then there is an email address.\n\n348\n00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:04.317\nAnd as an example lance@officeprodemo.co,\n\n349\n00:20:04.317 --> 00:20:08.377\nthis is the one that we don't want to do.\n\n350\n00:20:08.377 --> 00:20:11.639\nAnd I can't even run that\nwithout making it red.\n\n351\n00:20:11.639 --> 00:20:20.060\nAnd then, the other one instead,\nWould be the Windows email address.\n\n352\n00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.838\nAnd this is probably the one that you\ndefinitely want to make sure you take\n\n353\n00:20:25.838 --> 00:20:27.110\nadvantage of instead.\n\n354\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.497\nThat will leave everything alone,\nallow things to happen without disruption.\n\n355\n00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:36.182\nAnd that is going to be a key aspect of\nsomething that we wanna make sure that\n\n356\n00:20:36.182 --> 00:20:39.746\nwe understand and\nthat we do try when we start to do this.\n\n357\n00:20:39.746 --> 00:20:43.390\nWithout something like this\nyou're gonna break stuff and\n\n358\n00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:47.240\nthen trying to fix it may\nbe harder than you realize.\n\n359\n00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.740\nHopefully you've got good\nways to back everything up.\n\n360\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.440\nBut don't just randomly go let me just\ntry this out and see what happens.\n\n361\n00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.198\nYou can do that as long as you\ndo it on a test email account.\n\n362\n00:20:58.198 --> 00:21:01.799\nDon't ever do it on an account\nthat's active, is what I'm saying,\n\n363\n00:21:01.799 --> 00:21:02.615\nif you do that.\n\n364\n00:21:02.615 --> 00:21:04.832\nSo make sure you just test it out here.\n\n365\n00:21:04.832 --> 00:21:08.275\nI only have two accounts in this machine,\nso I'm gonna ruin one or the other and\n\n366\n00:21:08.275 --> 00:21:11.369\nthat's why I'm trying to avoid doing\nsomething like that right now.\n\n367\n00:21:11.369 --> 00:21:12.846\nBut remember to take a look,\n\n368\n00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:17.030\nvery much something that can get us right\non the exam when we're not thinking.\n\n369\n00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.168\nAnd it's easy enough to avoid.\n\n370\n00:21:20.168 --> 00:21:24.585\nNow the last particular command that\nI want to show you, at least for\n\n371\n00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:30.060\nthis segment here, is I told you about\nthe on premises side of this, right?\n\n372\n00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.050\nThat if you end up getting\nto this point where,\n\n373\n00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:38.390\nwhen you try to do something to\na mailbox in here, and I have seen this.\n\n374\n00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:43.250\nLet's take for an example that\nI decide that I'm going to add\n\n375\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:48.120\nin an email address, Here.\n\n376\n00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.630\nAnd then I fill the whole thing out\nexactly the way that I want to.\n\n377\n00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:52.688\nLet's see, Lance.\n\n378\n00:21:52.688 --> 00:21:58.090\nLet's say,\nlet's just do lbass instead, lbass.\n\n379\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.437\nIf I can spell bass.\n\n380\n00:22:01.437 --> 00:22:11.437\nLBass@officeprodemocoonmicrosoft.com.\n\n381\n00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.668\nSo there's the email\naddress that I put in.\n\n382\n00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:19.450\nSMTP click OK.\n\n383\n00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:23.428\nNotice that there're two options\nthat you end up seeing right?\n\n384\n00:22:23.428 --> 00:22:26.893\nSo that's kinda the same thing that's\nthe Windows option that we're also\n\n385\n00:22:26.893 --> 00:22:28.860\nseeing when we start doing this.\n\n386\n00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.470\nDaniel do you know what\nthe difference is between these?\n\n387\n00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.760\nIt looks identical just about right?\n\n388\n00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.790\nExcept for the email address but\ndoes that actually make\n\n389\n00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:42.720\nany difference between the capitalized\none and the lowercase one?\n\n390\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.341\nIt really does, and that's the key.\n\n391\n00:22:44.341 --> 00:22:46.050\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n&gt;&gt; It really does, yep.\n\n392\n00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:46.880\n&gt;&gt; That's surprising.\n\n393\n00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.\n\n394\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.914\nThis one marks it as\nbeing the actual primary\n\n395\n00:22:50.914 --> 00:22:51.680\ndefault-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n396\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.690\nthat's the bolding that they\nwere talking about earlier.\n\n397\n00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:54.249\n&gt;&gt; That's the bolding, yep.\n\n398\n00:22:54.249 --> 00:22:55.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, that makes sense.\n\n399\n00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does when you look at it.\n\n400\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.950\nSo, here's another kind of exam tip,\nright?\n\n401\n00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.270\nIf they show you something like this,\n\n402\n00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.690\nkind of understand that that's\nalso what's happening here.\n\n403\n00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.840\nNotice it says the default\nreply address is in bold, and\n\n404\n00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.120\nthat's telling you that that\nis the default address.\n\n405\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.970\n&gt;&gt; And capitalized.\n\n406\n00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:15.640\n&gt;&gt; And capitalized.\n\n407\n00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.489\n&gt;&gt; Something they forgot to mention\nthere in their little aside.\n\n408\n00:23:18.489 --> 00:23:21.010\n&gt;&gt; I know, you would think that\nwould be there, but it's not.\n\n409\n00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.920\nIt's something you're supposed to know.\n\n410\n00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.818\nSo that's how you know which one is\nthe primary address when you do this.\n\n411\n00:23:26.818 --> 00:23:30.610\nAnd notice this one is all in\nlower case and not that way.\n\n412\n00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:36.530\nIf you select that then at this\npoint you can actually change this.\n\n413\n00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:40.290\nWe're gonna see that a little\nbit later on as well.\n\n414\n00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.286\nWe're not gonna do it right now, but\nwe're gonna see this in a part two.\n\n415\n00:23:43.286 --> 00:23:47.079\nWhen we start to look at how we can\nadd in additional addresses and\n\n416\n00:23:47.079 --> 00:23:51.590\nthen change that additional address\nto a primary if we want to as well.\n\n417\n00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.702\nBut you can see where this happens too.\n\n418\n00:23:53.702 --> 00:23:58.248\nOkay, so that is something that will\nhelp you to distinguish that this is now\n\n419\n00:23:58.248 --> 00:23:59.605\na secondary address.\n\n420\n00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:04.976\nSo in theory whether Daniel sends\nit to Lance at Office Pro Demo\n\n421\n00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:10.370\ndot whatever or he sends it to Lbass,\nit will still work.\n\n422\n00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:14.470\nIt should actually work out for him\nbecause now we have that secondary address\n\n423\n00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.460\nand you'll actually be able to see that.\n\n424\n00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.690\nHere it is, look at that Daniel\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.480\n&gt;&gt; You need to pay attention right here.\n\n426\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.180\nYou can add change or delete an email\naddress associated with it's user.\n\n427\n00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.741\nThe user's primary email address\nis displayed in bold, but\n\n428\n00:24:26.741 --> 00:24:31.230\nthey'll receive an email address\nsent to any address in this list.\n\n429\n00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:37.080\nSo they do kind of give you you know,\nI can't, this is what they are doing But\n\n430\n00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.250\nif you haven't experienced it\nbefore if you're not that familiar\n\n431\n00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:44.440\nit doesn't make sense why the heck\nare both of them SMTP and doing that.\n\n432\n00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.410\nBut that's how you end up seeing that.\n\n433\n00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.220\nNow, one of the things I was\ntalking about was that on premise.\n\n434\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.785\nI don't know why I got\ndistracted I just did.\n\n435\n00:24:52.785 --> 00:24:55.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just to show us Is the idea here of\n\n436\n00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.593\nwhat I would have to do if I were to\nrun this from the on-premises exchange\n\n437\n00:25:00.593 --> 00:25:03.380\nPowerShell center instead.\n\n438\n00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.390\nNow if you do that,\nthis is different, right?\n\n439\n00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:10.350\nYou make sure that you go to the server\nthat's running exchange or wherever you\n\n440\n00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.320\nactually have the management console\nset up to get connected to exchange.\n\n441\n00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.880\nMake sure you have access to that\nExchange PowerShell center for\n\n442\n00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.770\nyour on premises stuff as well.\n\n443\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.666\nFrom that point you would\ntype in instead set\n\n444\n00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:30.388\nremote, Mailbox.\n\n445\n00:25:30.388 --> 00:25:33.167\nI was trying to see if it actually\ndid the autofill for me but\n\n446\n00:25:33.167 --> 00:25:37.120\nit doesn't cuz I know that this\ncommand is not actually gonna show up.\n\n447\n00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.554\nIt's here that you would still assume\nlance and then you could do the email.\n\n448\n00:25:45.087 --> 00:25:52.841\nAddress and\nthen Lbass at office pro demo co dotcom.\n\n449\n00:25:52.841 --> 00:25:56.269\nI'm just gonna shorten this up for\na moment.\n\n450\n00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.134\nAnd we need to actually disable\nthe email address policy.\n\n451\n00:26:07.854 --> 00:26:11.310\nAnd that's gonna be enabled but\nthen we're gonna set that to false,\n\n452\n00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.910\nis what we're gonna end up doing.\n\n453\n00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.970\nSo when we start to take a look\nat this particular address.\n\n454\n00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.300\nLet me see if I can get the whole\nthing on screen there at the top.\n\n455\n00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.950\nThis is the one that you would\nrun on your on premises side.\n\n456\n00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:28.630\nSo if you are inside that hybrid domain or\nthat directory synchronization, you've got\n\n457\n00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.840\nto make sure that you are running it from\nthat exchange on premises power shell.\n\n458\n00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.010\nI can't remember exactly.\n\n459\n00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.430\nI think that's what they call it.\n\n460\n00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.760\nYep, just wanted to make sure here.\n\n461\n00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.080\nExchange on premises PowerShell,\nyou need to run it from that and\n\n462\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.780\nmake sure that it's actually from\nthat one, or you'll not get it.\n\n463\n00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.880\nSo this command doesn't actually\nshow up in my exchange only.\n\n464\n00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.100\nYou're gonna select that email address\nthat you want to actually change.\n\n465\n00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.650\nSee another typo even in\nthe middle of all that.\n\n466\n00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.830\nThat's so sad, Ronnie,\n[LAUGH], even on a fake demo,\n\n467\n00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.400\nI still made a terrible typo right here.\n\n468\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.580\nAnd then you wanna disable\nessentially the email address policy\n\n469\n00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.730\nthat it sets up for us.\n\n470\n00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.260\nAnd that's kinda difference.\n\n471\n00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.930\nSo it shouldn't be much, but\nnotice how this one says remote mailbox.\n\n472\n00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.410\nIf you're gonna be connecting\nthe Office 365 online to do that,\n\n473\n00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.890\nwhere it's gonna be synchronized\nHas to be done that way.\n\n474\n00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.020\nRemember that everything you do\nin that hybrid organization,\n\n475\n00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:30.180\nif it's gonna be an administrative\nchange for, exchange or anything.\n\n476\n00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.200\nIt's gonna be done through\nthe on premises side, and\n\n477\n00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.070\nnot necessarily in the cloud\ninterface like we saw in the web UI.\n\n478\n00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.420\nAnd it's definitely not gonna be\ndone even in PowerShell remoting and\n\n479\n00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.690\njust going through Exchange online.\n\n480\n00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:48.480\nAll of that stuff is valuable and\nimportant when facing the exam.\n\n481\n00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.610\nThere's no other way to emphasize that.\n\n482\n00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:54.200\nIf I were to just say, all right, here's\nall the commands that you need to type in,\n\n483\n00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.810\nand you didn't have a clue where I was\nconnecting to, it would definitely not\n\n484\n00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.810\nhelp you out so that's why we want to\nshow at least even those three commands.\n\n485\n00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.200\nBut talk about those contexts so much.\n\n486\n00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.930\nBecause without that it\nreally does fail and\n\n487\n00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:08.610\nit's really gonna hurt you on the exam.\n\n488\n00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.550\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie,\nwe have definitely jumped feet first\n\n489\n00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.980\ninto configuring email addresses\nworking with Multiple addresses,\n\n490\n00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.230\nunderstanding what primary is,\nhow we can get aliases in there.\n\n491\n00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:23.760\nThere's a lot of good information here\ninside of that Office 365 environment.\n\n492\n00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.250\nBut I know you have\na wee-bit more to go on but\n\n493\n00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.750\nwe are fresh out of time for\nus to continue this.\n\n494\n00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.310\nIt looks like we're going into\na part two ladies and gentlemen.\n\n495\n00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.390\nSo strap in and grab your crash helmets.\n\n496\n00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.470\nCuz we are definitely\ngonna have to do that.\n\n497\n00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.360\nRonnie we do thank you though for\ngetting us this far.\n\n498\n00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.500\nWe're gonna continue on in that part two.\n\n499\n00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.630\nHopefully, we'll see you good folks\nthere to learn something new hopefully.\n\n500\n00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.500\nAnd that being said it's time for\nus to sign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n501\n00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.240\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n502\n00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:50.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n503\n00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.764\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n504\n00:28:53.764 -->

00:00:08.166\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.580\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.712\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:18.555\nwelcome to another exciting episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:23.497\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\non with more on our enabling services for\n\n8\n00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:28.120\nOffice 365 series,\nthe good old 70-347 as we like to call it.\n\n9\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.570\nAnd joining us in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.310\nthe we aforementioned is our\ngood friend Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.150\nRonnie, welcome back, man.\n\n12\n00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.910\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.110\n&gt;&gt; It is going great today as we\ncontinue on to taking a look, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.930\nat the exciting world of Office 365,\nyou've gotta love every bit of it.\n\n15\n00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.730\n&gt;&gt; I've been on the edge of my sit,\nRonnie.\n\n16\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.564\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes we have and\nwe're continuing today in a part two,\n\n17\n00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:52.400\nwhere we're talking about configuring\nadditional email addresses for,\n\n18\n00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.160\nof course, existing users inside\nof our Office 365 domain.\n\n19\n00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.940\n&gt;&gt; Now in our previous, right, we really\ndid emphasize the use, of course,\n\n20\n00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.720\nof PowerShell and\nthat's something you've gotta get used to.\n\n21\n00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.910\nThere's no way around it.\n\n22\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.710\nBut also on the exam objective itself,\n\n23\n00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.610\nthey've called out of course\nfamiliarity also with the Web UI.\n\n24\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.100\nAnd if there's a question that\nwe were always get post about\n\n25\n00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.360\nin our forums is always,\nhey, do I have to know both?\n\n26\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.060\nWell, on this exam, yes,\nyou definitely need to know both.\n\n27\n00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.057\nThey're really trying to\npush it to that end whereas,\n\n28\n00:01:28.057 --> 00:01:31.065\nnot just familiarity with one or\nmemorization of one.\n\n29\n00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:35.175\nThey really want to see if you really do\nknow how to be able to get around, and\n\n30\n00:01:35.175 --> 00:01:39.360\nmake sure that you understand what\nthe commands are doing for you.\n\n31\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.580\nSo we're at this point,\n\n32\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.990\nwhere now what we're doing is not only\nadding in additional email addressing.\n\n33\n00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.257\nWe also showed you how to replace\nthe primary email address, or\n\n34\n00:01:49.257 --> 00:01:53.943\nthe default email address inside\nof Office 365 or Your Exchange.\n\n35\n00:01:53.943 --> 00:01:56.651\nAnd now, we're actually going on and\n\n36\n00:01:56.651 --> 00:02:00.660\nwe are taking a look at\nmanaging aliases as well, okay.\n\n37\n00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.570\nAnd, what we'd also call secondary\naddresses and even SIP addresses\n\n38\n00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.760\nwhen it comes down to some of the things\nthat we have to be able to do.\n\n39\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.560\nRemember that, the email address inside\n\n40\n00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.510\nof Office 365 that is technically\nconsidered the SMTP address.\n\n41\n00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.360\nThat's the way that you and\n\n42\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.990\nI get email but also, in exchanging\nother things that are going on.\n\n43\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.610\nWe also have a SIP address.\n\n44\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.430\nWe also have a SharePoint address.\n\n45\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.320\nSo let me remind you of that.\n\n46\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.470\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer and\n\n47\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.060\nthat will help us in our\nmemory here a little bit.\n\n48\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.855\nSo I'm at the Exchange admin center\nas you can see over here on the upper\n\n49\n00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:36.040\nleft-hand corner.\n\n50\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.370\nThen underneath the recipients listing\nhere, I'm going to select mailboxes.\n\n51\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.210\nInside of mailboxes,\nI'm going to pick one of the other.\n\n52\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.110\nI'm just gonna pick up,\nlet's pick Joey this time.\n\n53\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.800\nI think I was using Lance the whole\ntime last time, so I'll pick on Joey.\n\n54\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.259\nHere, I'm gonna click on the pencil for\nedit.\n\n55\n00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:58.826\nAnd once I'm in here, I am looking at\nthis list of all of the attributes that\n\n56\n00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:01.219\nare also assigned to Joey himself, and\n\n57\n00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.610\nexchange, I'm looking for\nthe email address.\n\n58\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.190\nAnd you'll notice right down here that,\n\n59\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.520\nthere are three separate email\naddresses that it looks like, right?\n\n60\n00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.030\nHere's the SIP email address.\n\n61\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.520\nSMTP for our mail and\nthen also SPOwhich a SharePoint online.\n\n62\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.080\nAll these are different types of\nemail addresses that can be used.\n\n63\n00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.800\nAnd, even inside of Office 365 is using\nsome of this for the basic communication.\n\n64\n00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.080\nAnd later on as you go on to Skype,\n\n65\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.090\nyou actually even get some other\nadditional addresses in here too.\n\n66\n00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.590\nSo there's a lot of different things\nthat can go on in here, and for\n\n67\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.010\nus to add them in,\nit's fairly simple inside of the Web UI.\n\n68\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.720\nWe simply click add, and\nonce we click on add,\n\n69\n00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.880\nthis is where we can come in and we can\nactually use these options for us, right?\n\n70\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.590\nThe simple mail transport protocol, or\n\n71\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.050\nthat exchange unified\nmessaging addresses there.\n\n72\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.887\nOr you can enter in a custom one and this\nis where we can also enter in that SPO one\n\n73\n00:03:58.887 --> 00:04:01.061\nif we wanted to to be able to add in.\n\n74\n00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:04.152\nBut notice that there are other ones\nthat are also available in here,\n\n75\n00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:07.992\nif you happen to be using any of these\nother ones that are out here as well.\n\n76\n00:04:07.992 --> 00:04:11.730\nSo with that, we did show and\nmake sure that you remember\n\n77\n00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.350\nthat it is more than just the idea of\njust a simple email address that we have.\n\n78\n00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.690\nBut sometimes, let me go ahead and\ncancel all this.\n\n79\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.920\nWe need to be able to make\nsure that we can either add or\n\n80\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.600\nreplace an existing SIP\naddress that we may have.\n\n81\n00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.910\nNow, that one's actually fairly easy, you\ncan type it in exactly what I showed you.\n\n82\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.980\nBut the other one, of course,\nis gonna be going through PowerShell.\n\n83\n00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.130\nAnd this is what we want to make\nsure that we know how to do, and\n\n84\n00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.460\nhow you do this from PowerShell and\n\n85\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.010\ncan verify it from PowerShell,\nas well in terms of seeing this.\n\n86\n00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.080\nSo let's take a look at the PowerShell\ncommand to help us to do this,\n\n87\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.270\nright now, too.\n\n88\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.060\nSo let's take for\nan example that as we go in here I'm,\n\n89\n00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.880\nlemme make sure I'm actually connected,\nand sometimes these sessions do time out.\n\n90\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.950\nSo I'm verifying my state as open,\n\n91\n00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.289\nwhich is what I want, I have the available\nconnection for Microsoft Exchange Online.\n\n92\n00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.980\nSo I know I am good here.\n\n93\n00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.010\nAnd now that everything is up,\nI can now begin to type in for my mailbox.\n\n94\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.970\nIf I do a get mailbox and\nI said, let's do it from here.\n\n95\n00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.249\nLet's see what happens.\n\n96\n00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.779\nIt's asking me for credentials.\n\n97\n00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.379\nLet's see if I can type this\nin without too many mistakes.\n\n98\n00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:28.970\nNope, apparently I can't.\n\n99\n00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:35.101\nTry it one more time here.\n\n100\n00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:39.760\nAnd now, it's just creating\na new session and there we go.\n\n101\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.670\nSo we're pulling this up,\nI want us to see the alias.\n\n102\n00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.500\nAnd I want us to be able\nto check it here too.\n\n103\n00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.670\nHere's the mailbox that we're\ngonna be affecting at this point.\n\n104\n00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.230\nIf I wanted to change the current SIP, so\n\n105\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.080\nlet's say that we're changing\nthe standard that we're using, right?\n\n106\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.555\nInstead of using the\nfirst_name@OfficeProDemoCode.onMicrosoft-\n\n107\n00:06:04.555 --> 00:06:08.180\n.com that we're just simply gonna use,\nfirst letter,\n\n108\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.700\nlast name as the one that we're gonna use,\neven for SIP and everything instead.\n\n109\n00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.428\nWell from here,\nI am now setting this mailbox.\n\n110\n00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:22.780\nAnd I can use the alias or\nthe name itself.\n\n111\n00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.082\nAnd now,\nI'm going to type in EmailAddresses.\n\n112\n00:06:27.082 --> 00:06:32.245\nNow, if you're kind of looking at this and\nyou just watched the previous episode,\n\n113\n00:06:32.245 --> 00:06:37.113\nthe part one of this, it's probably\nbringing back a little bit of trepidation\n\n114\n00:06:37.113 --> 00:06:41.197\nfor you, because I told you what\ncan happen if we do this, right?\n\n115\n00:06:41.197 --> 00:06:43.090\n&gt;&gt; You said very bad things would occur,\nRonnie.\n\n116\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.580\n&gt;&gt; I said that some bad\nthings could occur.\n\n117\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.470\n&gt;&gt; The end of the world.\n\n118\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.600\nDogs and cats living together.\n\n119\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.890\nTotal anarchy, that kind of thing.\n\n120\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.890\n&gt;&gt; Well it could be, right?\n\n121\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.230\nEspecially if you do this and\nthe persons on the phone.\n\n122\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It could be a really bad day.\n\n123\n00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.920\n&gt;&gt; Because we,\nwe lose if I remember correctly.\n\n124\n00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.700\nWe lose the SIP address, right?\n\n125\n00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.740\nIf we don't have that written down or\nsave in somewhere safe it perform.\n\n126\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.034\nIf you do this, that's gonna be gone and\nit's gonna replace it.\n\n127\n00:07:05.034 --> 00:07:06.930\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, it really does.\n\n128\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.560\nIf just did this and\nthen add in our primary email address, you\n\n129\n00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.030\nwould go ahead and set that as being what\nthe default SMTP address is what we want.\n\n130\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.590\nBut then, it goes ahead and\n\n131\n00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.940\nremoves essentially SIP addresses and\nthose SPO addresses.\n\n132\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.545\nSo if you're in the middle\nof doing something,\n\n133\n00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:27.200\nwell now if there's anything\ndependent on that, now it's gone.\n\n134\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.586\nSo that's why you wanna be careful,\nbut because we're specifically\n\n135\n00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:37.150\ntalking about using the SIP\naddress instead, te way that we\n\n136\n00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.916\nmodify that is by specifying that\nthis is going to be a, oops.\n\n137\n00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:43.112\n&gt;&gt; Saved games [LAUGH].\n\n138\n00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:47.424\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, interesting here is actually\nlooking through my directory and\n\n139\n00:07:47.424 --> 00:07:48.820\ngoing through there.\n\n140\n00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:54.858\nSIP and then : and it is now,\nI want to make sure I type this in,\n\n141\n00:07:54.858 --> 00:07:59.754\nright, that I'll go\nlbass@ Officeprodemoco.\n\n142\n00:07:59.754 --> 00:08:00.890\nStill gotta spell that.\n\n143\n00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.869\n&gt;&gt; That's always fun.\n\n144\n00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:03.040\n&gt;&gt; That's always fun.\n\n145\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.370\n&gt;&gt; The good thing is they made it\na very short and easy thing to do.\n\n146\n00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:05.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know.\n\n147\n00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.580\nWe gotta.\n&gt;&gt; That was long.\n\n148\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.451\n&gt;&gt; We gotta shoot thank\nwhoever stood up our.\n\n149\n00:08:10.451 --> 00:08:11.586\n&gt;&gt; And that's gonna be Mr. Don.\n\n150\n00:08:11.586 --> 00:08:12.319\n&gt;&gt; That would be Don Pezet.\n\n151\n00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:13.099\n&gt;&gt; That would be Don Pezet.\n\n152\n00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:15.580\nHe loves doing this stuff for that.\n\n153\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.060\nSo that way I get in my\npractices in terms of typing.\n\n154\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.210\nSo this will actually end up\nreplacing that zip address for us.\n\n155\n00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.500\nSo we do need to add that in, that is\nthe way that that would end up happening\n\n156\n00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.570\nto do that one, and go ahead run that.\n\n157\n00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.240\nAnd let's see, now it's saying,\n\n158\n00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.760\nhey there is a argument transfer I\ncannot convert this to that address.\n\n159\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.910\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie,\nany time these things happen I've noticed,\n\n160\n00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.910\nespecially on shows that I'm with you.\n\n161\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.740\nThe first troubleshooting move that you're\ngonna wanna pull is, check that typing,\n\n162\n00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.170\ncuz I know Ronnie,\nnot the greatest of typists.\n\n163\n00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.140\nWe don't like to harp on that.\n\n164\n00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.720\nBut we do, cause it happens.\n\n165\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.422\nI'm gonna go with that; I'm gonna go with,\nlet's check the syntax first.\n\n166\n00:08:56.422 --> 00:08:57.640\nAll right, so, let's go ahead and\n\n167\n00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.140\ntake a look at exactly what\nhappened here as we look down.\n\n168\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.960\nAnd so\nI'll show you exactly what I typed in.\n\n169\n00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.950\nSo there it is.\n\n170\n00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:11.980\nI typed this in, and I tell you what,\nthat to me that is 100% correct,\n\n171\n00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.570\nexcept for one thing-\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n172\n00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.640\n&gt;&gt; Which is right here.\n\n173\n00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.950\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n174\n00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.880\n&gt;&gt; There was a space, and when you have\nthat space in there, that would mean-\n\n175\n00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.220\n&gt;&gt; It actually interprets that space.\n\n176\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit really does interpret that space.\n\n177\n00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.765\nSo if you take a look down at\nthe bottom of the screen though,\n\n178\n00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:33.490\nyou'll notice that without the space,\nI went ahead and put a backspace in here.\n\n179\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.850\nThen it was able to take it and set it.\n\n180\n00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.270\nNow this brings up a good exam point for\nus and\n\n181\n00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:44.790\nthis is why the exam writers at\nMicrosoft really do love this.\n\n182\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.904\nAnd I'm hoping that they\nwouldn't be that picky.\n\n183\n00:09:46.904 --> 00:09:49.547\nI really am hoping that but-\n&gt;&gt; Fingers crossed.\n\n184\n00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:51.982\nYeah, but at the same time, right,\n\n185\n00:09:51.982 --> 00:09:56.384\nthere is a difference between\neasily identifiable wrong syntax,\n\n186\n00:09:56.384 --> 00:10:00.640\nwhich is something that this one\nis not as easily identifiable.\n\n187\n00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.100\nI probably would have pulled my\nhair out for another three or\n\n188\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.550\nfour minutes before I went back up.\n\n189\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.700\nIt wouldn't just be the space I look down,\nit's like, yeah,\n\n190\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.780\nthe only difference that I\ncan see is a space here.\n\n191\n00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.530\nSo I said let me try without the space.\n\n192\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.190\nSo when I did it,\nit accepted it right away.\n\n193\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.611\nBut you've got to know stuff like that and\n\n194\n00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:19.670\nthe only way you're gonna\ndo that is not through.\n\n195\n00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.300\nJust to show like this, but it's by you\npracticing it and getting it wrong like\n\n196\n00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.980\nthis a couple of times,\ngetting red all over the actual screen.\n\n197\n00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.270\nAnd then when you hit it and\nit's right you're not gonna forget that.\n\n198\n00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.920\nThat's essentially what it comes down to,\n\n199\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.240\nas when you see something like this on\nthe exam, you're gonna pay more attention\n\n200\n00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.650\nto what you're reading and it's gonna\nreally help you out when you do this.\n\n201\n00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:45.200\nSo that is one of the things that we wanna\nmake sure that we end up doing here.\n\n202\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.470\nIs that now we can see where we;ve\nreplaced this, and there it is.\n\n203\n00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.750\nSo it gives us that ability to do so.\n\n204\n00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.780\nAnd this is something that\nyou are going to see,\n\n205\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.130\nI'm not gonna say specifically\nthis one on the exam.\n\n206\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.360\nBut as you see this,\nyou can replace this with anything.\n\n207\n00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.070\nIf you wanted to add in or\nchange the SMTP address,\n\n208\n00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.980\nyou could do the same thing right here.\n\n209\n00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.170\nYou definitely can do any of\nthat using this same command.\n\n210\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.140\nThis one because it's specifically\ncalled out on the exam I used SIP.\n\n211\n00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.720\nAnd that's the idea here,\nis that we do have this change.\n\n212\n00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.908\nSo let's take a look and\nsee if that change has already occurred.\n\n213\n00:11:19.908 --> 00:11:24.860\nSometimes the GUI or\nthe webui might be a little bit slower,\n\n214\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.770\nand maybe even me, which is unusual.\n\n215\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.150\nBecause I'm pretty slow.\n\n216\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.440\nSo I'm gonna select Lance Bass.\n\n217\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.670\nHopefully I selected the right name.\n\n218\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.160\nThat's the key.\n\n219\n00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.010\nDon't put it past me like the other guy.\n\n220\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.490\nMy accident as we check this out.\n\n221\n00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.120\nThen I select email address here.\n\n222\n00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.640\nAnd now you can see what happened here.\n\n223\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.310\nNow look because I wasn't super careful,\n\n224\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.670\ndo you remember that there was\nanother address that was right here?\n\n225\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.130\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n226\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:53.630\n&gt;&gt; Now notice because I use\nthat email address as my SPO,\n\n227\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.010\nmy SharePoint online address went away.\n\n228\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.200\n&gt;&gt; Has been wiped out.\n\n229\n00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.231\n&gt;&gt; That is not good, okay.\n\n230\n00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:03.012\nThat could be terrible and\nthat's why you have to slow down and\n\n231\n00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:05.200\nfigure out what goes on here.\n\n232\n00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.650\nNow this is probably the most\npopular way to do this.\n\n233\n00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.320\nBut the other command would\nhave worked just as well.\n\n234\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.280\nBut I wanna show this because in previous\nepisodes I showed you the windows one.\n\n235\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.750\nI said I'm not gonna do this right\nnow because it could break something.\n\n236\n00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.621\nBut now that I know that we're kind of\ndone with that portion of the show,\n\n237\n00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:26.332\nI don't really mind breaking it so much\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n238\n00:12:26.332 --> 00:12:27.147\nBreak it good Ronnie.\n\n239\n00:12:27.147 --> 00:12:27.797\n[LAUGH] Snap it in half.\n\n240\n00:12:27.797 --> 00:12:29.334\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm not gonna be able to use it.\n\n241\n00:12:29.334 --> 00:12:31.277\nThat would even be more awesome.\n\n242\n00:12:31.277 --> 00:12:31.802\n&gt;&gt; That would be a fun show.\n\n243\n00:12:31.802 --> 00:12:32.928\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n244\n00:12:32.928 --> 00:12:35.747\n&gt;&gt; So here you see the result.\n\n245\n00:12:35.747 --> 00:12:39.859\nNow, could I have just replaced it\nwith that Windows address instead.\n\n246\n00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:41.710\nYou better believe it, okay.\n\n247\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.380\nIf I would have done that, it would\nhave left that other address alone.\n\n248\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:50.160\nIt would have replaced this one, too, but\nit would have left the other ones alone.\n\n249\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.250\nSo be aware,\nas you start thinking through this.\n\n250\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.970\nMake sure you read the context of what\nyou're given when you're preparing for\n\n251\n00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.090\nthe exam.\n\n252\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:04.330\nIn real life you got to know that as well,\nright?.\n\n253\n00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.940\nThat something like this could again cause\nissues in the midst of SharePoint and\n\n254\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.790\nstuff like that and other things that\nare going on here too so just be aware.\n\n255\n00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.240\nAs things like this may\nend up happening for you.\n\n256\n00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.410\nHopefully it won't happen to often.\n\n257\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.840\nBut it can and that's something\nyou also want to pay attention to.\n\n258\n00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.470\nNow the other thing that we\nwant to also be able to do\n\n259\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.940\nis make sure that we can add\nan additional email address.\n\n260\n00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.100\nNow I did show this.\n\n261\n00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.010\nBut only when we replace\nthe primary address.\n\n262\n00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:40.404\nSo in part one I showed you where we are\nrunning essentially the set mailbox lance,\n\n263\n00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:42.837\nand then instead this\nemail address is here.\n\n264\n00:13:42.837 --> 00:13:45.762\nWe typed in that Windows address,\nand we did so\n\n265\n00:13:45.762 --> 00:13:48.395\nthat replaced a primary address itself.\n\n266\n00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:53.240\nAnd then it also made whatever was\nthere before my kind of back up, or\n\n267\n00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.330\nsecondary address,\nan alias is what it ended up making.\n\n268\n00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.560\nAnd then it left all those\nother addresses alone.\n\n269\n00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.130\nBut now as we do this,\n\n270\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.730\nwhat if I just didn't want to\nreplace the primary address?\n\n271\n00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.520\nSo for Lance,\nhis is still called Lance, right?\n\n272\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:14.520\nAnd I wanted to add in this\nlbass Office Pro on Microsoft,\n\n273\n00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.860\nOffice Pro democo, on microsoft.com.\n\n274\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:24.590\nWell, this where I would go back in, and\nnow I would type in mailbox for lance.\n\n275\n00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.470\nAnd this time it's going\nto be the same thing,\n\n276\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.470\nemail addresses is what I want for\nthis one.\n\n277\n00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.290\nAnd now we have to change\nit up a little bit.\n\n278\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:39.330\nSo, let's see, I'm going to kind of zoom\nin just a little bit more as we get here.\n\n279\n00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.850\nWe have to start off with an at symbol,\nthen the fancy brackets or\n\n280\n00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.730\nthe curly braces,\nwhatever you wanna call them I don't know.\n\n281\n00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:51.750\nThen you do an add= and now\n\n282\n00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.570\nI'm gonna give it a different name cuz-\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n283\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:02.360\n&gt;&gt; This particular guy I think in\nthe group was actually a backup singer,\n\n284\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.597\nso I'm gonna call him backup singer.\n\n285\n00:15:06.597 --> 00:15:11.515\nOkay at oops office pro, yeah.\n\n286\n00:15:11.515 --> 00:15:19.900\nDemoco.onmicrosoft.com of course,\n\n287\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:24.680\nthat means I'll also need to close\nout of those fancy brackets.\n\n288\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.950\nSo if everything is spelled right,\nthat's what should be also added in but\n\n289\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.230\nnot replacing anything.\n\n290\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.538\nSo here it's saying the term,\nlet's see, is not recognized.\n\n291\n00:15:37.538 --> 00:15:39.110\nOops, let's see.\n\n292\n00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.620\nWhat did I type in?\n\n293\n00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.440\nAs the name of a commandlet.\n\n294\n00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.279\nSo it did not like my,\nmy email address here.\n\n295\n00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:51.968\n&gt;&gt; Rodney yeah, actually let's take a look\nat your syntax on that email address there\n\n296\n00:15:51.968 --> 00:15:54.670\nbecause I know sometimes they\nlike quotations around them.\n\n297\n00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.448\nSo maybe that might be\ncausing the problem.\n\n298\n00:15:56.448 --> 00:15:58.708\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this again.\n\n299\n00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:01.507\nSo as we start to see,\nthere is the original syntax,\n\n300\n00:16:01.507 --> 00:16:03.109\nthe one that it didn't like.\n\n301\n00:16:03.109 --> 00:16:07.085\nAnd I'm leaving the red up here because I\ndon't want you to be afraid of the red.\n\n302\n00:16:07.085 --> 00:16:08.732\nDon't get me wrong-\n&gt;&gt; It does look scary.\n\n303\n00:16:08.732 --> 00:16:11.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does look scary,\nespecially red on black.\n\n304\n00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.020\nIt seems to indicate something\nvery ominous at times.\n\n305\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.820\nBut on this one, Daniel's right.\n\n306\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.620\nNormally, when you have something like\nthis, especially like an email address,\n\n307\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.690\nwe normally do include\nthem with quotes instead.\n\n308\n00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:28.140\nSo let's see either completely wrong or\nit works.\n\n309\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.160\nSo we'll see here too so let me go\nahead and see if I can add in quotes.\n\n310\n00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.370\nOops, that's not gonna work.\n\n311\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.480\nLet's do the double quotes.\n\n312\n00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.670\nI don't know,\na single quote might have worked.\n\n313\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.589\nBut I'm gonna do it in double quotes.\n\n314\n00:16:38.589 --> 00:16:40.300\n&gt;&gt; I would do it double quotes,\nI like double quotes.\n\n315\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.345\nThey seem safer to me, I don't know why.\n\n316\n00:16:42.345 --> 00:16:45.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, that's different, and it took it.\n\n317\n00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.171\nGood job, Daniel.\n\n318\n00:16:47.171 --> 00:16:50.180\nSometimes again, yeah,\nyou have to pay attention.\n\n319\n00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.428\nIt's the same thing, right?\n\n320\n00:16:53.428 --> 00:16:55.320\nIf we did a display name, right?\n\n321\n00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.410\nAnd we have actually put like,\nRonny Wong and\n\n322\n00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.800\nput a space in, we'd also have\nto include an in quotes as well.\n\n323\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.430\nAnd email addresses, sometimes,\nthey are notorious for\n\n324\n00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.760\nthis, where they're like look,\nyou're gonna need to use quotes here.\n\n325\n00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.610\nSometimes, you'll end up seeing where you\ndon't use quotes at all, for example,\n\n326\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:12.880\nlike the sip up here didn't need quotes.\n\n327\n00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.100\nBut yet, the very next command\nthat I typed in right here,\n\n328\n00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.610\nit needed the quotes, so\n\n329\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:23.450\njust pay attention when you're starting to\nsee some of this stuff as it adds it in.\n\n330\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.570\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for the consistency, Microsoft.\n\n331\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:27.830\n&gt;&gt; It probably makes sense somewhere.\n\n332\n00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.740\nI'm pretty sure somewhere along the line-\n&gt;&gt; There's a guy.\n\n333\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.746\n&gt;&gt; There is a guy that-\n&gt;&gt; Out of his mind going this is totally\n\n334\n00:17:34.746 --> 00:17:35.698\nawesome.\n\n335\n00:17:35.698 --> 00:17:39.160\n&gt;&gt; The strange thing is you and I listen\nto him, we'd probably go that makes sense.\n\n336\n00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.949\n&gt;&gt; Right, he'd have some great,\ngrand design on why this is occurring.\n\n337\n00:17:42.949 --> 00:17:43.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n338\n00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.240\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's see what happens\nthen as I now have added in this.\n\n339\n00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.670\nNow if I'm completely wrong,\nit's replaced everything and now all-\n\n340\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.763\n&gt;&gt; It'll be a fun show.\n\n341\n00:17:53.763 --> 00:17:56.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is backup addresses here.\n\n342\n00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.820\nBut there you go.\n\n343\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.130\nNotice once again, there it is,\nthe backup singer, but now notice,\n\n344\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.320\nwe have two SMTP addresses.\n\n345\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.210\nIt didn't modify any of the other things.\n\n346\n00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.450\nIt didn't replace this one with,\nexcuse me.\n\n347\n00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:16.500\nIt didn't replace this one with this one\nand then make the other one the secondary.\n\n348\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.720\n&gt;&gt; So, this is exactly what I needed.\n\n349\n00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.310\nSometimes, we do want the replacement\nof a primary address.\n\n350\n00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.666\nBut there are other times where we don't.\n\n351\n00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:27.232\nWe just needed a secondary one,\nanother alias that we add in and\n\n352\n00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:29.061\nthat happens from time to time.\n\n353\n00:18:29.061 --> 00:18:33.726\nSo, let me give a kinda of good\nexample for us right here so\n\n354\n00:18:33.726 --> 00:18:39.310\nlet's say for ITproTV,\nmy email address is ronnie@itprro.tv.\n\n355\n00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:43.940\nBut we know something that people\nare used to typing in .com.\n\n356\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:50.668\nSo what there is is there's another email\naddress that's added into my account,\n\n357\n00:18:50.668 --> 00:18:54.871\nwhich is I believe it is,\nronnie@itprotv.com.\n\n358\n00:18:54.871 --> 00:18:57.292\nAnd so\nyou might even see variations of that,\n\n359\n00:18:57.292 --> 00:19:01.753\nwhere we where we've added in those other\naddresses in there because we've bought\n\n360\n00:19:01.753 --> 00:19:06.168\nall those domains that somebody would go\nhow are they going to mistakenly do this?\n\n361\n00:19:06.168 --> 00:19:08.515\nAnd we add those things in and\nonce you have that,\n\n362\n00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:10.450\nthen you can do stuff like that.\n\n363\n00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.310\nBut that gives us that\nflexibility regardless of\n\n364\n00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:17.070\non your end whether you remember\nmy entire email address or not.\n\n365\n00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.010\nIf you get close to it,\n\n366\n00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.680\nyou're more than likely to hit me\nas far as an email address goes.\n\n367\n00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.940\nSo there are good reasons for doing that.\n\n368\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.088\nBut make sure you pay\nattention again to the syntax.\n\n369\n00:19:26.088 --> 00:19:28.640\nRemember, we emphasized the difference\nbetween the capital letters and\n\n370\n00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.990\nthe bold versus the lower case and\nnot bold as well.\n\n371\n00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.590\nOne's gonna indicate the primary and\n\n372\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.160\nthe other one's gonna be\nthat alias that we have too.\n\n373\n00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.791\nSo that's kind of the part of all the\nstuff that we wanted to at least be able\n\n374\n00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:41.623\nto get into.\n\n375\n00:19:41.623 --> 00:19:44.150\nAs far as replacing or\nadding in addresses,\n\n376\n00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:48.656\nwe've already seen a lot of that, but\nthis is kind of the end of that particular\n\n377\n00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:51.960\nportion of what we need to\ndo with email addresses.\n\n378\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.520\nBut that doesn't mean that we're done\nbecause we still have to go into the other\n\n379\n00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.430\nside of this, where working with\nindividuals that need this replaced.\n\n380\n00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.370\nAnd we can see when, right,\nsomebody changes their name,\n\n381\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.750\nsomebody gets married\nthen you change the name.\n\n382\n00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.330\nDoing that or we change companies,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n383\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.330\nOr we move from one place to another,\nwhatever it is.\n\n384\n00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:14.868\nWe decide something like\nthat's gonna happen.\n\n385\n00:20:14.868 --> 00:20:19.333\nWell, all that can be changed a user at\na time, but if there are multiple users,\n\n386\n00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:23.464\nif there are bulk users, we need to\nunderstand that there has to be a way for\n\n387\n00:20:23.464 --> 00:20:24.720\nus to do that.\n\n388\n00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.529\nWell, one is fairly simple.\n\n389\n00:20:26.529 --> 00:20:29.888\nDaniel and I,\nwe split up a list of 500 people and\n\n390\n00:20:29.888 --> 00:20:33.820\nwe manually start typing this\nstuff in one line at a time.\n\n391\n00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.710\nDaniel, sound fun?\n\n392\n00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.378\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'd probably get about 10,\n\n393\n00:20:36.378 --> 00:20:39.979\n15 users in and then you start typing your\nresume, [LAUGH] looking for another job.\n\n394\n00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:43.898\nCuz that is monotonous, boring work and\nkind of defeats the purpose of us\n\n395\n00:20:43.898 --> 00:20:49.120\nhaving things like computers, supposed to\nmake repetitive tasks a whole lot easier.\n\n396\n00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.410\nI'm guessing they've built in some\nsort of functionality like that.\n\n397\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:56.630\n&gt;&gt; They have, and it makes it easy in\na couple of different ways for us.\n\n398\n00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:00.750\nOne of course, is built right\nin to the GUI interface itself.\n\n399\n00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:05.890\nBut that's not as easy as it seems because\nlet's take a look at my machine here and\n\n400\n00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.290\nI'll show you what I'm talking about.\n\n401\n00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:12.080\nSo Daniel, just right from scratch, let's\nsay that we're migrating users over but\n\n402\n00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.960\nwe haven't decided to do\nthe on-premises synchronization,\n\n403\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.480\nthe directory synchronization and\nall that.\n\n404\n00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.070\nWe're just gonna start adding\npeople into Exchange here.\n\n405\n00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.930\n&gt;&gt; Fire away.\n\n406\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.810\n&gt;&gt; Well now, look up here.\n\n407\n00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:24.990\nThis is mailboxes, right?\n\n408\n00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.100\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda the primary basic\n\n409\n00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.720\nindividual unit inside of Exchange.\n\n410\n00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.640\nYou and I both know that.\n\n411\n00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.650\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; But look here,\n\n412\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.620\nDaniel, there is no plus symbol, okay?\n\n413\n00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.760\nSo if you've take a look\neven behind the three dots-\n\n414\n00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.450\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you right-click somewhere.\n\n415\n00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no right.\n\n416\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.400\nAdd remove columns,\nset default messaging size,\n\n417\n00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.250\nrestrictions, export data\nto a CSV advanced search.\n\n418\n00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.370\nI have a search and I have a-\n&gt;&gt; Not add new mail box.\n\n419\n00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:52.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no add new mailbox.\n\n420\n00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.910\n&gt;&gt; That's strange.\n\n421\n00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.920\n&gt;&gt; Inside of the GUI, it's not there.\n\n422\n00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.090\n&gt;&gt; So you can't actually add new\nmailboxes through the GUI itself?\n\n423\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.320\n&gt;&gt; Well, not here.\n\n424\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:02.828\n&gt;&gt; Not this way.\n\n425\n00:22:02.828 --> 00:22:05.197\n&gt;&gt; You can but you have to go and\n\n426\n00:22:05.197 --> 00:22:10.077\nadd them in as a user inside\nyour Office 365 domain.\n\n427\n00:22:10.077 --> 00:22:12.710\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; And then you assign a subscription.\n\n428\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.620\nAnd if there's subscription has mail\nenabled, it will create their mailbox.\n\n429\n00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:18.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah.\n\n430\n00:22:18.215 --> 00:22:18.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no.\n\n431\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n432\n00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.832\nThat's no, no.\n\n433\n00:22:23.832 --> 00:22:28.190\nWe're kinda taking this to a conclusion.\n\n434\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.843\nIs there a way to add bulk\nusers in the Office 365?\n\n435\n00:22:30.843 --> 00:22:31.810\nAre we able to do that?\n\n436\n00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.740\nI mean-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n437\n00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:38.380\nSo it could be that but still a little\nmore work than I really wanna do.\n\n438\n00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.762\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is workable and\nwhen you do something like that,\n\n439\n00:22:41.762 --> 00:22:44.877\nright, you'd come up with CSV,\nthe limited files.\n\n440\n00:22:44.877 --> 00:22:46.680\nAnd then you'd have to\nsplit them up though.\n\n441\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.440\nI think it only allows you\nto do like 250 at one time.\n\n442\n00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.874\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So [CROSSTALK] there are limitations to\n\n443\n00:22:51.874 --> 00:22:55.089\nit but once you do that,\nyou will get them in there, okay?\n\n444\n00:22:55.089 --> 00:22:58.860\nIt will end up happening that\nwill give you what you need.\n\n445\n00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.760\nBut what we're really\ntalking about at this point,\n\n446\n00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.320\nthough, is just making sure\nthat we can do this but\n\n447\n00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.210\nreally like additional email addresses\nis what we're talking about.\n\n448\n00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:12.540\nNow if we do something like this,\nit's also about that new domain thing.\n\n449\n00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:17.377\nWhat did my company now, Daniel,\nis gonna be bought out, right?\n\n450\n00:23:17.377 --> 00:23:20.528\nAnd here it is, I'm-\n&gt;&gt; The emerging companies.\n\n451\n00:23:20.528 --> 00:23:21.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we're emerging companies and\n\n452\n00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:25.210\nwe've decided that my company's\nname is not gonna be there anymore.\n\n453\n00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.680\nBut now we have to change to\nwhat you're company's name or\n\n454\n00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.550\nsomebody else's company's name.\n\n455\n00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.850\nBut now I already have\nan account in there.\n\n456\n00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.120\nWhat happens then?\n\n457\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.710\nWe wanna be able to go through and\n\n458\n00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:40.990\nessentially assign a new domain to\nthe users that currently exist.\n\n459\n00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.440\nSo we can do this one at a time.\n\n460\n00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.001\nThere's no doubt we can\ndo this one at a time.\n\n461\n00:23:45.001 --> 00:23:49.497\nOnce we have those domains in there,\nwe can do that all day long and create\n\n462\n00:23:49.497 --> 00:23:54.674\naliases, replace the primary, replace\nwhatever the new one is with the primary.\n\n463\n00:23:54.674 --> 00:23:57.172\nWe've shown you how you can do that,\nthat's easy.\n\n464\n00:23:57.172 --> 00:24:01.422\nBut what we need though As something\nthat can not only do that one time.\n\n465\n00:24:01.422 --> 00:24:03.598\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We need it to actually go through\n\n466\n00:24:03.598 --> 00:24:06.320\nour entire exchange email boxes.\n\n467\n00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.610\nEssentially looping through each one,\nfinding the domain that we want to\n\n468\n00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:16.090\nreplace, putting a new domain in its\nplace, and then writing it back in.\n\n469\n00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.190\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie,\nyou said the magic word there, looping.\n\n470\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; This makes me think we're heading\n\n471\n00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:22.390\nstraight to Power Shell for\nsome sorts of script.\n\n472\n00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:25.210\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna be headed\ninto Power Shell to do this.\n\n473\n00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.960\nAnd that's pretty much the only way that\n\n474\n00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.150\nwe can really start to\ntake a look at doing this.\n\n475\n00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.780\nSo that is some that we've got to realize.\n\n476\n00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.250\nBut you have got to understand\nthe process because if not,\n\n477\n00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.630\nwhat we're about to show you, if not,\nif I'm about to run out of time,\n\n478\n00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.180\nI maybe about to run out of time here.\n\n479\n00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.060\nWhat we may actually have to do is,\nwe may have to go to a part two.\n\n480\n00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.853\nBut overall though, is that if\nyou don't understand the process,\n\n481\n00:24:48.853 --> 00:24:51.455\nthen you're just watching\nthe script that we're about to do.\n\n482\n00:24:51.455 --> 00:24:52.740\n&gt;&gt; Part three, Ronnie, part three.\n\n483\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe a part three is possible.\n\n484\n00:24:53.885 --> 00:24:55.631\n&gt;&gt; We're in part two.\n\n485\n00:24:55.631 --> 00:24:56.761\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right,\n\n486\n00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:57.469\nthis isn't part three.\n\n487\n00:24:57.469 --> 00:24:59.218\nGod, see,\nlook at how much I've forgotten already.\n\n488\n00:24:59.218 --> 00:25:00.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n489\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.205\nSo overall though.\n\n490\n00:25:01.205 --> 00:25:02.708\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to the show Ronnie,\nit's great to have you [LAUGH].\n\n491\n00:25:02.708 --> 00:25:04.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which show am I doing now?\n\n492\n00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.570\nSo on this one,\nit is something that if I just show you,\n\n493\n00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.040\nyou'll probably look at me and\ngo, I'm never gonna do that.\n\n494\n00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.780\nAnd you're probably right at some point.\n\n495\n00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.110\nBut somebody out there is\ngonna do this and at least,\n\n496\n00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:18.450\nif you understand the process\nof what needs to go on,\n\n497\n00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:23.590\nit'll make more logical sense to you for\nwhat we're about to enter into as well.\n\n498\n00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.592\nBut since I am running low on time,\nlet me go head and\n\n499\n00:25:25.592 --> 00:25:28.491\nmake sure that we've got everything\nset up the way that we need to, okay?\n\n500\n00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:32.371\nFirst, if we're gonna do something\nlike this where we know it's gonna be\n\n501\n00:25:32.371 --> 00:25:35.700\na replacement of the part to\nthe right of the at symbol, right?\n\n502\n00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.391\nSo our domain name,\nI have to have that particular domain\n\n503\n00:25:40.391 --> 00:25:43.527\nname registered in my Office 365.\n\n504\n00:25:43.527 --> 00:25:45.300\nSo let's see if I've got that yet.\n\n505\n00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.190\nSo I've done this a little bit earlier,\nbut\n\n506\n00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.530\nit can take a little\nbit of time to do this.\n\n507\n00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:54.050\nSo over in Office 365,\nlet me click on the admin up here.\n\n508\n00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.910\nLet me get out of Exchange,\nlet me go over here.\n\n509\n00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:01.416\nAnd then I'm going to scroll down to,\non the left-hand side,\n\n510\n00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:04.828\nI am looking underneath Settings for\nDomains.\n\n511\n00:26:08.463 --> 00:26:12.170\nNow right here, you can see\nI've got two different domains.\n\n512\n00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:16.330\nHere is my default one that I've been\nusing throughout the entire series.\n\n513\n00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:23.590\nAnd here, this one right here, this\nitprotvdemo.com, and I've set this up but\n\n514\n00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:28.900\nit's still in progress, so it may not\nable to be use for my show right now.\n\n515\n00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.770\nBut once you get that setup and they have\na nice little guide for you to do this.\n\n516\n00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.600\nOnce you add it in, it will have to\nverify that you own that domain.\n\n517\n00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.671\nAnd once that's done, now you have\naccess to both of those domains.\n\n518\n00:26:40.671 --> 00:26:46.258\nIf you try and run this and you don't have\nthat domain in there, it'll tell you yeah,\n\n519\n00:26:46.258 --> 00:26:51.089\nyou don't own this domain, I can't\ncomplete the process in doing this.\n\n520\n00:26:51.089 --> 00:26:56.580\nBut overall though, this is what our\ndesire is to switch over to this.\n\n521\n00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.950\nIf it doesn't actually clear up\nbetween now and our next episode,\n\n522\n00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:06.018\nwhen we begin that, what we'll do is we\ncan do a duplicate domain is what I'll do.\n\n523\n00:27:06.018 --> 00:27:08.200\nI'll just kinda say,\nall right we're gonna migrate over and\n\n524\n00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.820\nit's gonna look exactly the same.\n\n525\n00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:15.090\nBut overall though, we need at least that\nto go on, then of course won't need to\n\n526\n00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:20.140\ncreate the script that we're going to run,\nor the looping that we're going to run.\n\n527\n00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.880\nWhere it goes through each\nof my email addresses, and\n\n528\n00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.050\nthe great thing is, I only have two,\nactually there's three that's there.\n\n529\n00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.954\nTwo or three email addresses and\n\n530\n00:27:28.954 --> 00:27:32.416\nit's got to find then the domain\nthat I'm gonna replace.\n\n531\n00:27:32.416 --> 00:27:36.854\nAnd then of course replace it with a new\ndomain name that I'm gonna add in and\n\n532\n00:27:36.854 --> 00:27:39.753\nmake sure that everything\nis in place to do that.\n\n533\n00:27:39.753 --> 00:27:42.643\nSo that is pretty much our\nprocess when we do this, but\n\n534\n00:27:42.643 --> 00:27:46.758\nwe're not gonna have time to actually\nstart that cuz starting the typing can\n\n535\n00:27:46.758 --> 00:27:50.510\ntake a little bit longer than\nwhat I have available to me here.\n\n536\n00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.590\nBut at the same time, that is what we're\ngonna head into on our part three,\n\n537\n00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.420\nis what we're gonna see.\n\n538\n00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.040\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nit's a really good stopping spot then.\n\n539\n00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.720\nThat's what we'll do.\n\n540\n00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.100\nWe'll make this the end of part two.\n\n541\n00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.990\nAnd come back for that definite part\nthree, so as you could see actually,\n\n542\n00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.811\nhow we do this stuff,\nwe got you nice and appetite, so\n\n543\n00:28:05.811 --> 00:28:09.550\nhow do we do with this lovely bulk,\nad remove of these merged domains?\n\n544\n00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.310\nIt's gonna be crazy.\n\n545\n00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.590\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun, so.\n\n546\n00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:16.130\nAnd definitely something that you can\ncount as a good skillset to have in your\n\n547\n00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.710\ntoolbox when you're out there or\ntrying to pass the exam as it were.\n\n548\n00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.029\nRonnie, thanks for getting us here so far.\n\n549\n00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:23.667\nWe've got a little bit more to go.\n\n550\n00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:26.503\nSo it looks like we'll go ahead and\njust close down this show and\n\n551\n00:28:26.503 --> 00:28:27.688\nwe'll see you guys next.\n\n552\n00:28:27.688 --> 00:28:30.020\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your hose Daniel Auric.\n\n553\n00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:30.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n554\n00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.112\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n555\n00:28:33.112 --> 00:28:39.034\n[MUSIC]\n\n556\n00:28:39.034 --> 00:28:41.728\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:16.160\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\ngentlemen to Enabling Office 365 Series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.090\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.350\nI wasn't able to make the first two\nshows but I am sure here for part three\n\n7\n00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.390\nwe're going to continue to look at how\nto configure multiple e-mail addresses.\n\n8\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.040\nAnd with us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.174\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:33.992\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back in\nthe show as we continue on taking a look,\n\n11\n00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.830\nof course, at configuring these\ndifferent email addresses.\n\n12\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.130\nAnd what we're going to take a look\nat today is a little bit strange and\n\n13\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.340\na little bit vague on the exam\nobjective as it's called out.\n\n14\n00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.190\nAnd that why I wanted to\nslow down here just for\n\n15\n00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.840\na moment as we take a look\nat this particular topic.\n\n16\n00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.310\nThe reason why is that the interpretation\nof what this exam objective really means\n\n17\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.890\nhas been confusing.\n\n18\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.450\nSo, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n19\n00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.270\nwhen you told me what we were doing today,\n\n20\n00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.910\nI kind of assumed that we were gonna\nbe using PowerShell, using CSV files.\n\n21\n00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.209\nBut you said, nope, that's not it.\n\n22\n00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.789\n&gt;&gt; It is unusual.\n\n23\n00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.341\nOne of the things that and you might think\nis as we start talking about multiple\n\n24\n00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:16.316\npeople or multiple addresses needing to be\nadded in Exchange, we would normally use\n\n25\n00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:19.910\na CSV file that we can then import\nin a lot of users at one time.\n\n26\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.560\nRemember that if we do that We are still\nactually limited to about 250 people.\n\n27\n00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.580\nAnd if you saw in part one or part two,\n\n28\n00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.320\nI can't remember exactly which episode it\nwas, I told you about that limitation.\n\n29\n00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.590\nBut I even showed you\nthat in Exchange itself,\n\n30\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.950\nyou can't directly just add an email box\nif the accounts are not yet created.\n\n31\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.940\nSo, it doesn't give you that.\n\n32\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.240\nEven in PowerShell you'd\nhave to go through and\n\n33\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.850\ncreate all those accounts first.\n\n34\n00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.020\nAnd then you could add\nin those mailboxes but\n\n35\n00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.990\nyou're not actually able to\ndo it all in one fell swoop.\n\n36\n00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.050\nSo when we start to take a look here,\n\n37\n00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.750\nespecially in a way that\nthe objective calls it out,\n\n38\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.680\nit talks about this unusual idea of\nadding in bulk e-mail addresses but for\n\n39\n00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.580\na new domain, and this is where\nit becomes a little bit trickier.\n\n40\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.430\nSo, when we start seeing that,\nwe got to understand what that means.\n\n41\n00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.540\n&gt;&gt; So, are we going to start taking\npreexisting email addresses, and\n\n42\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.880\nchanging them to a new domain,\njust to verify?\n\n43\n00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly what we're\ngoing to end up doing here,\n\n44\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.490\nis that, what we're talking about\nis a scenario that happens,\n\n45\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.050\nactually, probably,\nmore regularly than I think.\n\n46\n00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.180\nHere which is, let's take for\nan example that we might have a company\n\n47\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.920\nthat ends up getting\nbought by another company.\n\n48\n00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.850\nYou decide that you're not gonna keep the\nprevious company's email domain itself but\n\n49\n00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.910\ntheir gonna merge into the new one.\n\n50\n00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.210\nBut what happens if we just create\nanother new email with the new domain.\n\n51\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.790\nWell that means that if we do that and\nwe delete out the old ones.\n\n52\n00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.240\nAny email that was coming\ninto that old address.\n\n53\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe I have a lot of\ncorrespondents perspective clients or\n\n54\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.900\ncustomers and\nI really need to retain all that.\n\n55\n00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you need that retention, but if\nwe don't retain that and we just give new\n\n56\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.220\nemail address, means those emails pretty\nmuch are just gonna be stuck somewhere.\n\n57\n00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.550\nAnd now all of a sudden,\n\n58\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.300\nCherokee would have to manage\ntwo different email accounts.\n\n59\n00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.160\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like fun [LAUGH].\n\n60\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds neat so far.\n\n61\n00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.123\n&gt;&gt; No! [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yeah,\nnot in a corporate setting, right?\n\n62\n00:03:08.123 --> 00:03:11.062\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Not managing two\ndifferent email addresses [LAUGH].\n\n63\n00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:13.316\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be terrible to try and\ndo that.\n\n64\n00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:16.199\nBut what we can do though is instead,\n\n65\n00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:21.250\nis that we can actually be able\nto keep that same account.\n\n66\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.160\nAnd make sure that email still\nflows to the old domain.\n\n67\n00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.340\nSo to be able to do that.\n\n68\n00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.480\nAnd then, as we add a new domain in.\n\n69\n00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.240\nIt means that we can also accept\nnew email that comes in there, but\n\n70\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.280\nit's still only under one account, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.270\nSo let me show you what, hopefully,\nthe end result should look like for\n\n72\n00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.630\nan end user, and\nmake sure that this happens.\n\n73\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.920\nAnd we'll talk about how this\nshould happen for us, and\n\n74\n00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.690\nwhat we need to do to make it work.\n\n75\n00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.870\nSo, let's take a look at my\nmachine as we get started.\n\n76\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.700\nHere I am already logged in as Joey,\n\n77\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.740\nI'm going to click on the admin center,\nand then when I do so I'm gonna look for\n\n78\n00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.450\nof course the exchange admin\ncentre is what I'm going to do.\n\n79\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.480\nSo over on the left hand\nside down at the bottom,\n\n80\n00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.200\nas I scroll down a little bit more.\n\n81\n00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.780\nI'll still have that same admin icon.\n\n82\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.023\nI'm going to scroll up and\nlook for Exchange.\n\n83\n00:04:19.023 --> 00:04:20.920\nLet me zoom out for a moment.\n\n84\n00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.140\nOnce I get access in here,\n\n85\n00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.550\nit means I'm going to select\nunderneath the recipient category.\n\n86\n00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.320\nMailboxes.\n\n87\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.280\nWithin mailbox,\nlet me pick on Lance for now.\n\n88\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.150\nIf I select Lance and then I edit,\nlet's take a look at the email\n\n89\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.500\naddresses in which Lance can be\nreceiving email on currently.\n\n90\n00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.460\nIf I click on email address,\nhere's what we have access to, okay.\n\n91\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.314\nSo currently, you do end up seeing\nhere is his primary default\n\n92\n00:04:53.314 --> 00:04:57.702\nemail address which is\nlance@officeprodemoco.microsoft.com.\n\n93\n00:04:57.702 --> 00:04:59.000\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n94\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.570\nThat's exactly what we had\nsetup at the very beginning.\n\n95\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.730\nRight here though the second one.\n\n96\n00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.720\nNotice the lower case and\nit's not actually in bold.\n\n97\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.990\nI click off it,\nyou can see it's not in bold.\n\n98\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.420\nThis is his alias.\n\n99\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.466\nIn other words, it actually is a alias and\nthis one says BackupSinger,\n\n100\n00:05:15.466 --> 00:05:19.580\nofficeprodemoco here on Microsoft.com.\n\n101\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.120\nSo we showed you how to do that in the\nfirst two episodes somewhere around there,\n\n102\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.650\nwhere you're actually\nable to see that edition.\n\n103\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.136\nBut notice that both of these if I\nhover over them, it is exactly the-\n\n104\n00:05:30.136 --> 00:05:32.422\n&gt;&gt; The same domain name.\n\n105\n00:05:32.422 --> 00:05:37.859\n&gt;&gt; Domain name, now if we want to add\nin another one, let's say that this is\n\n106\n00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:44.720\nnow been sold out to ITPRO.TV demo.NET If\nI click on this address, or the ad symbol.\n\n107\n00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.531\n&gt;&gt; Are you telling me we're going\nto have to add the alias for\n\n108\n00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:47.605\nevery one of our users, Ronnie?\n\n109\n00:05:47.605 --> 00:05:50.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is possible that\nwe may have to do that.\n\n110\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.750\nSo now let's just do this one,\n\n111\n00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.580\nwe'll lance@itprotvdemo.net.\n\n112\n00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.340\nAnd click OK.\n\n113\n00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.490\nNotice that when I did this now, we now\nhave this new address that we've added in.\n\n114\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.960\nNow this one is going\nto be an alias right.\n\n115\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.000\nIn other words it will accept\nemail that will come in.\n\n116\n00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.375\nAnd we can even send email\nfrom it if we need to.\n\n117\n00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:21.063\nBut primarily this is the one\npeople are gonna reply,\n\n118\n00:06:21.063 --> 00:06:25.260\nwhen I reply it's gonna reply as this and\nhere's the default one that I would have.\n\n119\n00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.340\nIf I wanted to set this one up as being\nthe primary I could do so fairly easy.\n\n120\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.180\nLet me click, i'm not gonna do for\nright now because we don't need to.\n\n121\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.360\nI make it the reply address and that\ncan also end up happening there for us.\n\n122\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.430\nSo that is at least part of\nthe goal that we want to set here.\n\n123\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.130\nHe has to go ahead and be able to do this.\n\n124\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.400\nNow if we are to do this, there's gonna be\na couple of things that we have to have\n\n125\n00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.370\ninside of Office 365 to make this work.\n\n126\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.510\nSo let's make sure that we\nunderstand what we have to have.\n\n127\n00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.450\nOne, we have to have\naccess to this domain.\n\n128\n00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.340\nOkay, so if I don't have this domain\nadded in, and it's not available to me.\n\n129\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:12.021\nIn other words, I don't own that domain or\nOffice 365 can't contact that domain for\n\n130\n00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:15.039\nthis to be done,\nthen it's not going to work.\n\n131\n00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:17.080\nOkay, so that's pretty much key.\n\n132\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.470\nYou can't just make up one.\n\n133\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.390\nThat's what I'm trying to say.\n\n134\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.950\nSo it's not something\nyou can just make up.\n\n135\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.850\nIt's something that you\nwould just purchase and\n\n136\n00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.360\nthen it would be registered somewhere and\nyou can do this.\n\n137\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.750\nOf course you can do this\nin Office 365 as well.\n\n138\n00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.810\nBut it requires you to purchase that\ndomain and Office 365 if you do so.\n\n139\n00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:32.860\nSo that is rule one.\n\n140\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.290\nI'm gonna get rid of this because\nwe're gonna do this fusing\n\n141\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.750\na PowerShell of course.\n\n142\n00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.210\nIs what's going to end up happening here,\nso I'm gonna click Cancel for right now.\n\n143\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.870\nNow, when it comes down\nto something like that,\n\n144\n00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.140\nlet me see if I can get back to\nthe admin center just for a moment.\n\n145\n00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:54.062\nOnce we start doing this, the way that you\nverify that you're going to be able to\n\n146\n00:07:54.062 --> 00:07:57.896\ncreate those email aliases is\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n147\n00:07:57.896 --> 00:08:01.224\nI'm gonna look for\nthe gear where it says also Setting.\n\n148\n00:08:01.224 --> 00:08:08.000\nAnd then domains and inside of the\ndomains, this is what you're looking for.\n\n149\n00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.380\nNotice here is my default right now which\nis the one that I've been using throughout\n\n150\n00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.480\nthe entire series and here is\nthe one that I added in here, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.210\nSo if you already have one that you\nown and it's already registered with\n\n152\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.770\nDNS registrar somewhere, perfectly fine\nbut if you don't, you can buy one.\n\n153\n00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.430\nAs long as it's available out there,\nyou can buy one.\n\n154\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.870\nMicrosoft will go ahead and help you set\nthat up, and get everything setup here.\n\n155\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.130\nYou want to make sure that\nit says setup is complete.\n\n156\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.010\nIf the setup is not complete, well,\nthat's when you're gonna have issues.\n\n157\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:38.600\nOkay?\n\n158\n00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.340\nSo it may take a little bit of time.\n\n159\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.130\nThis maybe have taken me half an hour or\nso.\n\n160\n00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.130\nBut overall though, it can take up to,\n\n161\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.990\nyou know, 72 hours in theory before\neverything is completely set up.\n\n162\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.558\nBut not normally that long.\n\n163\n00:08:51.558 --> 00:08:56.084\n&gt;&gt; Well, with you using the graphical user\ninterface here this administrative center,\n\n164\n00:08:56.084 --> 00:08:58.480\nit does seem like it\nwould take a long time.\n\n165\n00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.870\nI mean for small organization it would be\nfeasible, but for a larger organization,\n\n166\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.740\nis that why we're going to\nbe looking at PowerShell?\n\n167\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.080\nTo kind of Expedite this process?\n\n168\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've gotta think about, right?\n\n169\n00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.270\nShowing you the way I did,\nit's only showing you one user at a time.\n\n170\n00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:12.920\nWe can do that.\n\n171\n00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.270\nIf I have an organization of 500, I can\njust say all right, Cherokee, here it is.\n\n172\n00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.440\nHere's 250 names.\n\n173\n00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.040\nYou change everybody's email, or\nthe way that I just showed you here.\n\n174\n00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.850\nAnd I'll change the other 250,\nwe split the task up.\n\n175\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.530\nIt's still bad.\n\n176\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:32.280\nBut we can actually use PowerShell to\nhelp us to script this thing through,\n\n177\n00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.040\nwhen we do so,\nit's a little bit more challenging\n\n178\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.860\nbecause you've got to think about\nthe other step then that we have to have.\n\n179\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.350\nIf now I have the domain and that's a key\ncomponent if we're gonna change this,\n\n180\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.690\nif I now have the domain,\nI now need to have PowerShell or\n\n181\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:54.780\nsome type of script that will help me\nto do this thing that it has to do.\n\n182\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:00.100\nWhat I need is something that will allow\nme to get all of the email addresses\n\n183\n00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.440\ninside of what I have in Office 365.\n\n184\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.990\nSo I need to retrieve all of that.\n\n185\n00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.020\nThen I need to run something\nprogrammatically that will allow me to go\n\n186\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.580\nthrough each and\nevery one of those emails, look for\n\n187\n00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.578\nits primary email address itself,\n\n188\n00:10:17.578 --> 00:10:22.810\nkeep the left-hand side of the @ symbol,\nin other words the name, okay.\n\n189\n00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:30.820\nBut then say hey, when you find that name\nreplace the domain with a new domain.\n\n190\n00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.840\nSo that's not just a single\nPowerShell command, okay?\n\n191\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.980\nIt requires us to actually kind of\nget a couple of thing set up and\n\n192\n00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.980\nready before we can do so.\n\n193\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.870\nSo if you think about it, that's simple\nenough cuz I've done it in the GUI but\n\n194\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.370\nas you think about how to make this work,\nit is more challenging\n\n195\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.670\nif you're saying keep the original name on\nthe left-hand side, take whatever you find\n\n196\n00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:01.290\non the domain side, replace it with a new\nname that has to be up there somewhere and\n\n197\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.340\nthen go ahead and\nmake sure that's written down or\n\n198\n00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.440\nactually saved to each and\nevery one of those mailboxes.\n\n199\n00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.925\n&gt;&gt; But once you figure out those logistics\nof the actual syntax, moving forward and\n\n200\n00:11:13.925 --> 00:11:19.909\nautomating that process is going to be\nIt will automate this entire process so\n\n201\n00:11:19.909 --> 00:11:22.709\noverall the big picture\nyes more up front work but\n\n202\n00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:25.220\nin the long run it will save you time.\n\n203\n00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.200\n&gt;&gt; It should save you time.\n\n204\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.360\n&gt;&gt; Should save you time [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.774\n&gt;&gt; So in other words yes\nthe more that you have, yes,\n\n206\n00:11:29.774 --> 00:11:33.080\nthe more that this is gonna\nsave you a little bit of time.\n\n207\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.750\nSo, we're gonna show you this.\n\n208\n00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.030\nNow, I'm showing you this because,\n\n209\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.430\none, you need to know how this\nactually ends up working.\n\n210\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.640\nOn the exam itself,\n\n211\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.410\nI don't know they'll have time to\nreally bring you this far into it.\n\n212\n00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.555\nThis is a little bit more complex than\njust the regular types of PowerShell\n\n213\n00:11:49.555 --> 00:11:50.670\ncmdlets we've been running.\n\n214\n00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.120\n&gt;&gt; Well let's get started Ronnie\nbecause this is a skill that\n\n215\n00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.990\nI wish I would have had out in\nthe field or at least a tutorial\n\n216\n00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.560\nbecause it is going to come in handy if\nyou have to perform a migration like this.\n\n217\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.050\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so let's go ahead and get started.\n\n218\n00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.240\nSo let's take a look\nat my computer screen.\n\n219\n00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.390\nWe want to make sure of course\nthat I am first of all,\n\n220\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:10.730\nconnected to the Exchange Online.\n\n221\n00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.710\nAnd I'm just gonna run\na get-pf session and\n\n222\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.510\nmake sure that we have\nthe configuration in Exchange Online.\n\n223\n00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.420\nIt is available and the state is open.\n\n224\n00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.740\nIf it says broken,\nyou have to make the connection again.\n\n225\n00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.790\nSo right now,\nI am connected to Exchange Online and\n\n226\n00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.750\neverything is ready for me to go.\n\n227\n00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.910\nFrom this point I need to\ncreate a variable here.\n\n228\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:36.900\nSo I'm gonna create a variable,\nwe're gonna call this one newDomain.\n\n229\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.243\nI'm gonna actually call it\nnewDomainName just to make it easy and\n\n230\n00:12:40.243 --> 00:12:42.950\nmake it a little more understandable for\nus.\n\n231\n00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.790\nSo here's the newDomainName.\n\n232\n00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.450\nNow here I'm gonna run an actual\ncommand to help us out.\n\n233\n00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:53.100\nAnd this one is gonna be read-host and\n\n234\n00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.183\nthen I'm gonna tell it what\nto actually read out for us.\n\n235\n00:12:56.183 --> 00:13:05.120\nType in the new domain name like this.\n\n236\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.300\nNow when I do this and\n\n237\n00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.340\nI press Enter at this point, notice\nthat it simply types it out for me and\n\n238\n00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.680\nreads it out for me here and now, it's\nsaying hey, what do you want to make this?\n\n239\n00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.960\nNow, I didn't have to do that.\n\n240\n00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.750\nI could have probably\nactually just entered it in,\n\n241\n00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.030\nand just said it equals in this quote.\n\n242\n00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.160\nBut at this point, I just wanted to show\nyou that this is one way you can do it.\n\n243\n00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.190\nLet's say that you're waiting to figure\nout what that new domain name is.\n\n244\n00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:31.259\nNow, all I have to do is\ntype in itprotvdemo.net.\n\n245\n00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.880\nNow what is that doing?\n\n246\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:39.640\nIf we're not sure, it is going to\nessentially store what ITPPROTVdemo.net\n\n247\n00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.630\ninto this variable up here\nthat we call new domain name.\n\n248\n00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.930\nIt's going to hold it in\nRAM under that name and\n\n249\n00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.940\nwe're going to be able to use\nwhat's in green up there,\n\n250\n00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:52.229\na little bit later on as we continue to\ntype what we actually have to type next.\n\n251\n00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:59.250\nThe second thing I'm going to do,\nis I want to actually run a command and\n\n252\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:06.700\nthen store it where it retrieves a copy of\nall the mailbox information that I need.\n\n253\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.650\nSo this one I'm gonna call it,\neveryMailbox.\n\n254\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:13.880\nAlright?\n\n255\n00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:20.577\nThen I'm gonna do a equal and\nthis is gonna be get dash,\n\n256\n00:14:20.577 --> 00:14:25.481\nlet me move my cursor out here,\nget-mailbox,\n\n257\n00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:29.526\nthen dash result size use the tab fill,\n\n258\n00:14:29.526 --> 00:14:35.184\nthat will help me out and\nmark this as being unlimited.\n\n259\n00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.113\nSo that's gonna run through\nmy exchange here and look for\n\n260\n00:14:42.113 --> 00:14:47.270\nevery single mailbox and some of\nthe attributes that I have stored with it.\n\n261\n00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.520\nAnd it's gonna store what?\n\n262\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.950\nIn a variable that we call every mailbox,\nright?\n\n263\n00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.533\n&gt;&gt; So this could take a while if\nyou have a large organization?\n\n264\n00:14:54.533 --> 00:14:55.940\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Take a little bit\n\n265\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.460\nof time if you have that but for\nme I don't have two users, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.790\nCuz that's the only\nthing that came up with.\n\n267\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.440\nSo I only have two users in my\nparticular domain at this point.\n\n268\n00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.860\nSo there's one that's Joey and\nthen there is the other one that is Lance.\n\n269\n00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.430\nI do have another mailbox out there\nthat we made for the e-discovery but\n\n270\n00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.440\nthat's not gonna matter so\nmuch for what we need.\n\n271\n00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.630\nNow, once I do this, what do I need\nto do with that variable, okay?\n\n272\n00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:25.040\nI now need to go in to\nevery single mailbox\n\n273\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.960\ninside of what I've stored in that\nvariable and tell it to do several things.\n\n274\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.270\nSo, this is where your typing\nskills should help you out,\n\n275\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.010\nif you're good at typing.\n\n276\n00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:42.790\nSo, now, I'm going to say, for each,\nand then, open parentheses here.\n\n277\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.401\nThere is already a variable set up for\n\n278\n00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:49.308\nevery mailbox that is\nthe dollar sign variable.\n\n279\n00:15:49.308 --> 00:15:54.832\nFor each mailbox inside of every mail box,\n\n280\n00:15:54.832 --> 00:15:59.747\nthat is the first thing I wanted to do.\n\n281\n00:15:59.747 --> 00:16:03.655\nNow I'm going to press Enter But\nyou know the guys at the Office 365,\n\n282\n00:16:03.655 --> 00:16:06.470\nthey were fairy smart in\ndoing what they needed to.\n\n283\n00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.980\nThis is now going to go\nout into that loop or\n\n284\n00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.030\nthat function that we're\ngonna end up seeing.\n\n285\n00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.550\nSo we're gonna have this\nopening fancy bracket,\n\n286\n00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.020\nwhich I'm gonna leave on its own line.\n\n287\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.460\nThen, press Enter again.\n\n288\n00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:29.990\nNow I need to create another variable,\nthat's gonna be my new email address.\n\n289\n00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.210\nAnd what is this email\naddress going to look like?\n\n290\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:37.330\nWell the first part of this email address,\nI need to call upon\n\n291\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:46.460\nthat variable of every mailbox,\nactually excuse me, mailbox.\n\n292\n00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.470\nSo there's already a mailbox in there.\n\n293\n00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.375\nMailbox excuse me.\n\n294\n00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:55.097\nMailbox.alias.\n\n295\n00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.673\nNow as far as our aliases go,\n\n296\n00:16:56.673 --> 00:17:00.710\nthis is what's normally on the left-hand\nside of the at symbol, okay?\n\n297\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.460\nThat's what we normally also\nhave there as far as an alias.\n\n298\n00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:11.990\nSo along with that one on the alias,\nthen we're gonna do a plus sign,\n\n299\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:24.051\nAnd then the @New DomainName.\n\n300\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.640\nWait, that shouldn't be an @ symbol.\n\n301\n00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.500\nThat should be, This, all right.\n\n302\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.000\nSo I forgot.\n\n303\n00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.800\nI was like, I'm looking for\nthe actual variable here.\n\n304\n00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.550\nThere's gonna be an @ symbol with it.\n\n305\n00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.340\n&gt;&gt; Dollar sign.\n\n306\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.480\n&gt;&gt; And the dollar sign.\n\n307\n00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.820\nI was like, why is that not\ncoming through, but that's why.\n\n308\n00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.440\nSo I even typed it wrong on my notes.\n\n309\n00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.140\n&gt;&gt; Well that's what you said.\n\n310\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.670\nYou said as long as you're\ngood at typing for this part.\n\n311\n00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah as long as you're good at typing\nyou're okay here, but if you're like me.\n\n312\n00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.140\nSo that's what the new email\naddress should look like.\n\n313\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:02.030\nIt should take the alias which is in\nthe current mailbox and add it to what?\n\n314\n00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.410\nThe new domain with this at symbol, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.570\nThat's what we're saying so far.\n\n316\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.700\nMake sure I go to the end,\nbefore I press Enter.\n\n317\n00:18:10.982 --> 00:18:15.840\nNow, I need another line,\nand this is gonna be,\n\n318\n00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:21.419\nof course, the mailbox and\nthe current email address.\n\n319\n00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.240\nPlus and an equal sign here.\n\n320\n00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:40.310\nAnd then this is gonna call upon\nthe new e-mail address, here.\n\n321\n00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:45.270\nSo, we've created a couple of different\nvariables here that should help us out.\n\n322\n00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.190\nOur last line in this and then we\nwill close it with a fancy brackets,\n\n323\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.030\nis going to be the PowerShell\ncmdlet that we are going to run.\n\n324\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:59.200\nThis one is gonna be to say hey take all\nthat information and then set the mailbox.\n\n325\n00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:07.804\nCall the identity This is now\n\n326\n00:19:07.804 --> 00:19:15.390\ngonna be mailbox.alias-emailadresses.\n\n327\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.355\nAnd then the dollar sign again.\n\n328\n00:19:17.355 --> 00:19:25.740\nMailbox.email addresses.\n\n329\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.710\nAnd then at the end there's one more, and\n\n330\n00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.230\nthis is going to be where it's\na little bit unusual here.\n\n331\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:40.060\nWhich is gonna be a pound sign,\ndash, what if.\n\n332\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:46.000\nNow this last little segment that we have,\nthe one that I'm pointing out right here.\n\n333\n00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.990\nThis allows us to run the script but\nnot apply the change immediately.\n\n334\n00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.060\nSo it essentially becomes a little\nbit of a lab environment for us.\n\n335\n00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.340\nWhat it should do is if there is\nan error in side of my script,\n\n336\n00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.320\nand more than likely if anybody's going to\nmake an error it's gonna be me right here.\n\n337\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.689\nIt should show up in red and\n\n338\n00:20:04.689 --> 00:20:08.187\nit should report to me why it\nwasn't able to carry through, okay?\n\n339\n00:20:08.187 --> 00:20:09.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n340\n00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.566\n&gt;&gt; So, the reason why we want that right\nis it gives us a chance to run through it\n\n341\n00:20:13.566 --> 00:20:14.145\nbefore.\n\n342\n00:20:14.145 --> 00:20:15.855\n&gt;&gt; Corrects errors before you execute.\n\n343\n00:20:15.855 --> 00:20:16.600\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\n\n344\n00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.610\nand all we have to do everything is good\nthen we simply run the whole thing again.\n\n345\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.470\nRemove the pound sign,\n\n346\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:28.000\ndash what if and it will then apply and\ndo everything that we need to.\n\n347\n00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.960\n&gt;&gt; I wish I had a hashtag what if in real\nlife before you make decisions, right?\n\n348\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.274\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that would be good.\n\n349\n00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:35.006\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would be awesome if we\n\n350\n00:20:35.006 --> 00:20:37.099\ncould do that, or a rewind button.\n\n351\n00:20:37.099 --> 00:20:38.142\n&gt;&gt; That's even better.\n\n352\n00:20:38.142 --> 00:20:40.370\n&gt;&gt; That would be much better here.\n\n353\n00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.460\nBut we don't have everything like that.\n\n354\n00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.020\nBut you know the guys at the Office 365,\n\n355\n00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.210\nthey were fairy smart in\ndoing what they needed to.\n\n356\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:48.810\nOkay.\n\n357\n00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:49.700\nNow let's go and\n\n358\n00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:55.560\ntake one more at which I've got to close\nwith that closing fancy bracket as well.\n\n359\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:01.640\nSo here's one last thing, which is\ngoing to be that closing fancy bracket.\n\n360\n00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:08.960\nSo that should be the entirety of what we\nneed to make sure that we have in place.\n\n361\n00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.830\nNow it is a lot.\n\n362\n00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.250\nThere's no way to sit there and go,\nis there an easier way to do this?\n\n363\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.060\nThere may be.\n\n364\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.810\nSomebody that's a whiz at PowerShell\nmight go, Ronnie, you're silly for\n\n365\n00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.890\ndoing all that.\n\n366\n00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:24.380\nBut this is normally what you have to\ndo because it is a complex task to say,\n\n367\n00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.770\ntake whatever is remaining here,\ngive me just the left-hand side of it.\n\n368\n00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.570\nAnd then add in this new one and\nthen do this.\n\n369\n00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.040\nSo it is changing everything that we see.\n\n370\n00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.760\nSo once everything is done here,\n\n371\n00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:42.010\nif I've done this correctly then we'll\nactually have one of two results, right.\n\n372\n00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.520\nEither it's gonna display being\nall completely red at 100%, or\n\n373\n00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.370\nit's should actually kind of say hey,\neverything's good.\n\n374\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:50.500\n&gt;&gt; Fingers crossed, Ronnie.\n\n375\n00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.770\n&gt;&gt; That is what we're hoping for.\n\n376\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:53.920\nAll right Cherokee, what do you think?\n\n377\n00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.380\nYou think I typed in\neverything correctly here?\n\n378\n00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.130\n&gt;&gt; I do, I have faith in you, Ronnie.\n\n379\n00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.770\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n380\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.320\nSo the key thing, one of the things that\nI ended up doing a couple of times wrong.\n\n381\n00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.680\nIs that, if you don't have the cursor,\nat the very end, it can end up\n\n382\n00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.490\nduplicating things for you, so you wanna\nbe very careful of stuff like that.\n\n383\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.990\nSo, I just wanna make sure that\nI am really at the very end, and\n\n384\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.530\nnow, here is the moment of truth,\nif everything ends up working out for us.\n\n385\n00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.090\nI'm gonna press Enter, and\nallow it to run, and see what happens.\n\n386\n00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.140\nNow at this point it is a waiting game.\n\n387\n00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.450\nWe're either gonna get red everywhere.\n\n388\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:26.095\n&gt;&gt; Blood.\n\n389\n00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:31.830\n&gt;&gt; Yep blood everywhere, or it's going to\nend up just taking a few moments here.\n\n390\n00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:35.970\nAnd doing everything that needs to and\nthen we should go back into the GUI and\n\n391\n00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.040\nverify that things have changed.\n\n392\n00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.890\nSo this is where the process begins.\n\n393\n00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:44.160\nNow this is why I don't think that we're\ngonna get called out on the exam for\n\n394\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.470\nthis whole thing.\n\n395\n00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:49.760\nBut you do need to understand the process\nof what is going to happen, and whether or\n\n396\n00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.310\nnot this thing can be done\n\n397\n00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:55.250\nprogrammatically inside\nof PowerShell as well.\n\n398\n00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:59.350\nNow the good thing is Cherokee, I'm\nseeing now that this looks different and\n\n399\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.910\nit spewed me back out here which is,\nI think a good sign.\n\n400\n00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.500\n&gt;&gt; What's under our C drive, yeah?\n\n401\n00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.270\n&gt;&gt; So that looks like a good sign here.\n\n402\n00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:12.052\nLet's check it out inside the GUI\nbefore I get a little bit\n\n403\n00:23:12.052 --> 00:23:14.854\ntoo overconfident with myself.\n\n404\n00:23:14.854 --> 00:23:15.970\nSo, I'm going to close out of that,\n\n405\n00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.710\nbecause we were just taking\na look at domain names there.\n\n406\n00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:24.300\nSelect exchange, and let's see what\nchanges have happened from the script,\n\n407\n00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.102\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n408\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.260\nIf I select mailboxes.\n\n409\n00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.130\nAnd good thing is,\neverything still looks the same here.\n\n410\n00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.680\nLet me click on,\n\n411\n00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.530\nlet's select lance cuz that way we'll\ncompare apples to apples this time.\n\n412\n00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.030\nEverything still looks good.\n\n413\n00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.385\nIf I select email addresses there we go.\n\n414\n00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:50.297\n&gt;&gt; ITProTVdemo.net.\n\n415\n00:23:50.297 --> 00:23:52.635\n&gt;&gt; The advantage of this, right,\n\n416\n00:23:52.635 --> 00:23:58.185\nis that this didn't end up like\nreplacing everything immediately, okay?\n\n417\n00:23:58.185 --> 00:24:01.174\nSo you might think, is that good or bad?\n\n418\n00:24:01.174 --> 00:24:05.679\nThat's really good Because if you're\ntransitioning your company over, right,\n\n419\n00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:09.796\nyou may still want to make sure that\nprimarily because as your company merges\n\n420\n00:24:09.796 --> 00:24:14.310\nand changes, right, those old customers\nare still gonna want to do what?\n\n421\n00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:19.700\nWant to send information to the other\ncompany for a little bit of time.\n\n422\n00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.070\nAnd we want them to do that.\n\n423\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.320\nAnd then after awhile you may\nchange that to become your default-\n\n424\n00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.020\n&gt;&gt; When you're ready to make that leap.\n\n425\n00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.060\n&gt;&gt; When you're ready to do so.\n\n426\n00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.000\n&gt;&gt; And change to the address.\n\n427\n00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.950\nPublic, like outward facing.\n\n428\n00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah because in part one and part two,\nCherokee since you weren't there,\n\n429\n00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.080\nis that we showed that if you actually\ndo the syntax with the email or\n\n430\n00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.210\nthe dash email addresses,\nit can literally wipe out everything, and\n\n431\n00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.550\nessentially replace the default one,\nand you may not be ready for that,\n\n432\n00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.040\nespecially in a situation like this.\n\n433\n00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I could see some\npeople getting angry at you,\n\n434\n00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.895\nif they weren't ready for that change.\n\n435\n00:24:50.895 --> 00:24:52.878\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this one though,\n\n436\n00:24:52.878 --> 00:24:56.890\ndoes allow you to do that, and\nthis is a pretty powerful script.\n\n437\n00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.480\nBut you've gotta make sure\nthat you understand that,\n\n438\n00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.230\nwhen you start seeing this,\nwhen you talk about bulk adding, right?\n\n439\n00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.640\nSo let's verify that this changed also for\nJoey.\n\n440\n00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.990\nIt been nice about had like 50 or\n60 users, but\n\n441\n00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.620\nthat starts that cost a lot of money for\nwhat we're doing.\n\n442\n00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.710\n&gt;&gt; For just the demonstration.\n\n443\n00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:18.730\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just doing two which\nis still not exactly cheap, but\n\n444\n00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.260\nat the same time, here we go okay.\n\n445\n00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.580\n&gt;&gt; You're able to see the process and\nthat's what counts here.\n\n446\n00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.110\n&gt;&gt; And so now notice that we did this and\n\n447\n00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.355\nI didn't even have to touch\nJoey's account at all.\n\n448\n00:25:26.355 --> 00:25:26.993\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n449\n00:25:26.993 --> 00:25:28.932\n&gt;&gt; And\nI didn't even have to use Joey's name.\n\n450\n00:25:28.932 --> 00:25:32.704\nBut that's why you actually can see where\nit is a little bit more challenging than\n\n451\n00:25:32.704 --> 00:25:33.800\nyou think.\n\n452\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.660\nRemember that process, right?\n\n453\n00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:41.370\nWe kept essentially the first part\nof right before the at symbol and\n\n454\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.968\nthen we essentially told it\nreplace the at symbol and\n\n455\n00:25:43.968 --> 00:25:49.321\nofficeprodemocoonmicrosoft.com with\n\n456\n00:25:49.321 --> 00:25:56.460\nitprotvdemo.net and that allows you to do\neverything right here all in one step.\n\n457\n00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.730\nWith one or two users you may go,\nnot very impressive.\n\n458\n00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:04.099\nWith 250, 500 users, you might be going,\nthat's a bit more impressive.\n\n459\n00:26:04.099 --> 00:26:07.470\n&gt;&gt; Hey Ronnie,\nyou want my 250 users list too?\n\n460\n00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:13.510\n&gt;&gt; I would absolutely be able to do that,\nvery much so, if I could figure this out.\n\n461\n00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, they say work smarter,\nnot harder, right?\n\n462\n00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, that is a key.\n\n463\n00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.300\nSo, let's make sure that as you start,\ntake a look.\n\n464\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.740\nNow, if you're trying to copy this down,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n465\n00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.120\nWe will have this with the show notes that\nwill be attached to this episode as well.\n\n466\n00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:35.000\nThe key is slow down and\ntype carefully if you're doing this first.\n\n467\n00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.500\nI recommend that you might even type it\nout on notepad first if you choose to\n\n468\n00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.150\nverify your syntax is correct.\n\n469\n00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:47.190\nYou can change these variable\nnames whatever you want\n\n470\n00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:51.370\nto as long as you can remember them I just\ntry to use some that was descriptive that\n\n471\n00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:57.290\nwe could kind of logically talk out and\nmake sure that you could understand it.\n\n472\n00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.650\nBut just make sure that\nyou do see that and\n\n473\n00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:03.240\nlet you also take a look at this as well.\n\n474\n00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.450\nNow, there's not a lot of time left for\n\n475\n00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.670\nus but\nI do want to talk about one other thing,\n\n476\n00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:13.170\nwe're not gonna show this part of it too\nmuch, because it really is the same thing.\n\n477\n00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.360\nWhat did we want it to remove that,\n\n478\n00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.900\nin other words,\nwe were in the middle of the merger deal.\n\n479\n00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.620\nAnd we said, let's go ahead and\nset up the email.\n\n480\n00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.770\nSo Cherokee and I go,\nlet's go and do this.\n\n481\n00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.480\nEven though it's available,\n\n482\n00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.660\nwe're not gonna tell everybody\nthat we've done this yet.\n\n483\n00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.390\nBut then, some mergers, right?\n\n484\n00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.100\nAfter a while it peters out,\nit never happens.\n\n485\n00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.670\n&gt;&gt; You mean gossip in\na work place happening?\n\n486\n00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.910\nNever.\n&gt;&gt; How in the world would that\n\n487\n00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:35.905\never happen?\n\n488\n00:27:35.905 --> 00:27:37.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Believe or\n\n489\n00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:41.390\nnot, the removal of this is\nalmost the exact opposite.\n\n490\n00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:47.170\nThe only thing that you're doing at this\npoint instead is that you're replacing\n\n491\n00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.970\nthe same thing, but you're just gonna\nend up removing those addresses, and\n\n492\n00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:57.900\nthe syntax is almost exactly\nidentical overall when you do this.\n\n493\n00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.220\nSo that's pretty much it, you just\nchange this domain name back to what?\n\n494\n00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.450\nYour original domain name.\n\n495\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.160\nAnd now it removes it for\neverybody else and there you go.\n\n496\n00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.440\nYou're ready to go.\n\n497\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.760\nSo we'll have that syntax as well\nbecause it really isn't that different.\n\n498\n00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.830\nAnd you just see me just simply change it.\n\n499\n00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.827\nAnd instead of me typing\nin new domain name,\n\n500\n00:28:17.827 --> 00:28:22.420\nI typed in remove domain name for\nthe variable that I created.\n\n501\n00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.170\nBut overall though, you'll see\nthe syntax is pretty much that way.\n\n502\n00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.530\nSo just take a look at\nthat on your own time but\n\n503\n00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.790\nrealize it is there,\nit's available to you.\n\n504\n00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.590\nAt least creating it,\nyou saw it happen here.\n\n505\n00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.310\nBeing able to remove it really\nis kind of almost the reverse.\n\n506\n00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.110\nThere may be a little bit of\ndifference in the syntax, but not so\n\n507\n00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.380\nmuch that it will throw\nyou off completely.\n\n508\n00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.820\nSo that is what I want to make sure that\nwe did get across and we start talking\n\n509\n00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:50.750\nabout the idea of bulk add and\nremove email addresses for a new domain.\n\n510\n00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:57.200\nAnd that's gonna be a key on the exam,\nCherokee because bulk and\n\n511\n00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.850\nadd email addresses is exactly what you\nand I were talking about at the beginning.\n\n512\n00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.060\nWe just need to add a ton of people's\nemail addresses in there and\n\n513\n00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.570\nwhen you do that you go all right,\nthen you realize in Exchange Online,\n\n514\n00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.690\nthere's no way to do that without\nactually creating brand new accounts.\n\n515\n00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.230\nWell, that's not what it's asking,\n\n516\n00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:17.620\nit's saying hey it wants you to replace\nthe domain name side for multiple users.\n\n517\n00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.550\nAnd that is what we showed\nright here in this show today.\n\n518\n00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.010\n&gt;&gt; You know, Ronnie,\nI can see the value and\n\n519\n00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.570\nunderstanding that from an exam\nperspective but just not only that.\n\n520\n00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.890\nI mean this is a great demo especially for\n\n521\n00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:32.255\npeople who are working because chances on\nyou may encounter something like this and\n\n522\n00:29:32.255 --> 00:29:34.935\nRonnie, you're really taken all\nthat leg work out of it for us.\n\n523\n00:29:34.935 --> 00:29:36.090\n[LAUGH] So thank you for that.\n\n524\n00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.380\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for joining us today.\n\n525\n00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.370\nBut stay tuned, we have more Office\n365 services headed your way.\n\n526\n00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.740\nWe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n527\n00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.350\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose,\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n528\n00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.113\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

00:00:11.856\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen to\nyour Office 365 services series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.390\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boost.\n\n6\n00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.858\nIn this episode we'll be looking\nat how to configure things.\n\n7\n00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:24.499\nSpecifically resources,\ngroups and what else, contacts?\n\n8\n00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.630\nAnd with us today back in\nstudios we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.960\nThank you for joining us Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.981\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back cuz\nwe continue on in our Office 365 journey.\n\n11\n00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:37.130\nAnd now we're kind of turning\nthe page a little bit.\n\n12\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.133\nWhere we're still working\nwith exchange a bit, but\n\n13\n00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.479\nnow we're actually moving on\nbeyond user mailboxes, and\n\n14\n00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.380\nadding in of course different things\non the user mailboxes as well.\n\n15\n00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.809\nWe're still going to be\ndoing some of that, but\n\n16\n00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.878\nnow we're actually taking a look,\nof course, about those ideas of contacts,\n\n17\n00:00:53.878 --> 00:00:57.980\nadditional resources, and\nof course even groups as we start to look.\n\n18\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.028\nBut one of the first ones that we\nreally want to talk about is the idea\n\n19\n00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:07.731\nhere of creating and\nmanaging some type of resource mailbox.\n\n20\n00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:09.990\nHopefully, I'll be able to say that soon.\n\n21\n00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.810\nUsually, inside of an organization, right.\n\n22\n00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.460\nWe do have users that always\nsend emails that do that.\n\n23\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.450\nAnd they normally represent,\nof course, a person that we have but\n\n24\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.120\nthere is other things that\ncan also need the benefits of\n\n25\n00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.770\na something like Exchange to\nhelp us out and even Outlook.\n\n26\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.860\nIn terms of it, needs a calendar,\nit needs the ability to schedule things.\n\n27\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.740\nIt needs the ability to\ncommunicate out that the,\n\n28\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.440\nthat what we have available is\navailable or is not available as well.\n\n29\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.650\nAnd this is when we start getting\ninto that idea of resources.\n\n30\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.460\nMost organizations have a certain\namount of resources, but don't have\n\n31\n00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.860\neverything available to us in the way that\nwe would want them to be at all times.\n\n32\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.330\nSo let's take, for an example, probably\nthe most used example of a resource,\n\n33\n00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.030\nwould be an example of\na common conference rooms.\n\n34\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.920\nSo for example in the building where\nwe are at Tower Technology Park\n\n35\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.677\nat ITPro.TV Studios.\n\n36\n00:02:06.677 --> 00:02:08.619\nThere's a common conference room, but\n\n37\n00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.900\nthere's actually different companies\nthat reside within in this building.\n\n38\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.294\nBut yet there is a single conference\nroom that is available for\n\n39\n00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:18.830\nall those companies to be able to use.\n\n40\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.270\nAs long as they scheduled\nthe ability to use that room.\n\n41\n00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.790\nWhat we don't want is something like\nITProTV needing that conference room and\n\n42\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.410\nthen one of the other companies\ninside of our building\n\n43\n00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.480\nneeding it exactly at the same time.\n\n44\n00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.336\nSo, instead what we can also do is\nsay here's how you schedule the use\n\n45\n00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:40.700\nof the conference room instead.\n\n46\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.700\nIn which you now actually make a request\nthat conference room for a meeting.\n\n47\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.800\nThat resource then can verify on\nthe calendar whether it's free or\n\n48\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.480\nwhether it's busy, and notify\n\n49\n00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.340\nwho's actually been invited to this is\neverything is actually open and available.\n\n50\n00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.910\nSo it might not actually be a person,\nbut we do need the ability to have that\n\n51\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.880\ncommunication system going on to be\nable to reserve that room if we need to.\n\n52\n00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.700\nTo use it when it's actually necessary\n\n53\n00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.750\nto allow people to understand when\nthey do have the availability for it.\n\n54\n00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.650\nSo that's what we're\ntalking about here today.\n\n55\n00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.330\nAll right, the great thing is you can\nactually be able to create one of these\n\n56\n00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.130\nresources relatively easy from\nthe Exchange admin center.\n\n57\n00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.369\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat the Exchange admin center and\n\n58\n00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.286\nyou'll see it's incredibly easy to do so.\n\n59\n00:03:31.286 --> 00:03:34.526\nNow, once we're in the Exchange\nadmin center that I pulled up,\n\n60\n00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:36.760\nI'm gonna click on recipients.\n\n61\n00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.010\nAnd then inside of recipients, notice\nright across the top of the page here,\n\n62\n00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.890\nwe have different categories\nof recipients right?\n\n63\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.340\nMailboxes, these are normally\nthe mailboxes, of course,\n\n64\n00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.820\nthat represent users.\n\n65\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.519\nAnd they can also represent\ndifferent resources.\n\n66\n00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.370\nWell, groups, resources,\ncontacts, shared, and migration.\n\n67\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.380\nI'm going to select resources right here.\n\n68\n00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.110\nNow one of the most common resources\nlike we mentioned, is a conference room.\n\n69\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.020\nBut I don't have any conference room.\n\n70\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.830\nSo I can click on this plus sign or\n\n71\n00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.130\nthe little drop down arrow\nright next to the plus sign.\n\n72\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.570\nAnd you'll notice that there it is.\n\n73\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.720\nThere's two different resources available.\n\n74\n00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.130\nA room resource and\nof course an equipment mailbox as well.\n\n75\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.930\nNow notice this needs to set up a mailbox.\n\n76\n00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.420\nWell that's how we make the request.\n\n77\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.150\nThat's how it actually sends it out.\n\n78\n00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.281\nThat if we are scheduling this it can\nactually identify itself as being\n\n79\n00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:31.283\nconference room a or conference center b,\nor whatever it might be.\n\n80\n00:04:31.283 --> 00:04:35.286\nAnd it can actually identify to whoever\nis gonna get this email that they're\n\n81\n00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:39.500\nscheduled for a meeting here at this\nparticular point in time as well.\n\n82\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.020\nSo all that is possible.\n\n83\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.720\nSame thing with equipment.\n\n84\n00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.770\nFor example, it might be where we do\nuse equipment like a projector or\n\n85\n00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.250\nmaybe a large screen TV for\nwhatever presentation that we're giving.\n\n86\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.450\nAnd, we have to actually\nmake sure that's on hand.\n\n87\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.846\nWell we wanna make sure of course then\nthat we also may have an equipment\n\n88\n00:04:57.846 --> 00:04:59.200\nmailbox as well.\n\n89\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.270\nSo let's start by just creating a room\nmailbox inside of using the web UI here.\n\n90\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.460\n&gt;&gt; Are we gonna set one up for\nour conference room?\n\n91\n00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and set one up for\na simple conference room, and\n\n92\n00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.870\nnotice that when we do this it tells us,\n\n93\n00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.130\na room mailbox is a resource mailbox\nthat's assigned to a physical location.\n\n94\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.170\nUsers can easily reserve rooms\nby including room mailboxes and\n\n95\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.380\nmeeting requests.\n\n96\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.610\nJust select the room mailbox from\nthe list, edit the properties,\n\n97\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.640\nsuch as booking request or\nmailbox delegations too.\n\n98\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.918\nSo from here I can select room and\nlet's say we'll make this one\n\n99\n00:05:33.918 --> 00:05:43.530\nConferenceRoom A, I don't know\nwhat else to call it right now.\n\n100\n00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.740\nThen we'll just call his one ConferenceA,\nfor the email address\n\n101\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.280\nnotice I have two domains and\nthat is because I have registered two or\n\n102\n00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.870\nmy Office 365 knows that there is two\ndomains it can serve at this point.\n\n103\n00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.430\nI can do it for the itprotvdemo.net or\nthe offficeprodemogo on Microsoft and\n\n104\n00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.850\nwe're gonna use the default\none that we have.\n\n105\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.555\nLocation, I can put in\n\n106\n00:06:11.555 --> 00:06:16.770\nTower Technology Park.\n\n107\n00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.850\nPhone number, we'll do 555-555-5555.\n\n108\n00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.185\nSo hopefully nobody is using\nthat as a phone number today.\n\n109\n00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:26.457\nIf they are, sorry.\n\n110\n00:06:26.457 --> 00:06:27.890\nOkay, this is what we'll have.\n\n111\n00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.491\nAnd of course the maximum number\nthat can comfortably seat people in,\n\n112\n00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.210\nlet's say this is gonna be 16.\n\n113\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.305\n&gt;&gt; Next time we'll have to do it 8675309.\n\n114\n00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:37.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n115\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.832\nWow, you're really bringing up\nold school there, aren't you?\n\n116\n00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:40.789\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n117\n00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.718\nI'd be impress if you can tell\nme who actually sung that song.\n\n118\n00:06:42.718 --> 00:06:43.432\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea right now.\n\n119\n00:06:43.432 --> 00:06:45.373\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n120\n00:06:45.373 --> 00:06:49.277\nYeah, so, Tommy Two Tone,\nif I remember right?\n\n121\n00:06:49.277 --> 00:06:50.725\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Tommy Two Tone, okay.\n\n122\n00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:54.580\n&gt;&gt; Click save.\n\n123\n00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.897\nAnd that's pretty much it,\nas far as a room mailbox goes.\n\n124\n00:06:57.897 --> 00:07:01.034\nIf everything is created successfully,\nwe will now have,\n\n125\n00:07:01.034 --> 00:07:04.870\nthe ability, then,\nto use this inside of our organization.\n\n126\n00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.044\nAnd anyone can then go and\nreserve that room and do what needs to, or\n\n127\n00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:10.837\nthe people that can reserve\nthe room can reserve the room.\n\n128\n00:07:10.837 --> 00:07:14.760\nSo it's just gonna create this mailbox for\nus to be able to do so.\n\n129\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.360\nHopefully in just a moment, that's going\nto happen, but while we're waiting on\n\n130\n00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.490\nthat, of course, it means that we can also\ncreate other ones that are out there.\n\n131\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.251\nBut let's take a look at doing this from\nthe standpoint of PowerShell then while,\n\n132\n00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:30.950\nit looks like it's taking\nquite a bit of time.\n\n133\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.656\nI'm gonna let that thing churn along and\n\n134\n00:07:33.656 --> 00:07:37.169\nbring up the good old PowerShell,\nto do it this way.\n\n135\n00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:40.830\nSo we're going to make sure that we\nare connected to Exchange Online.\n\n136\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.980\nI always like to run this command\nbefore I get started here.\n\n137\n00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.510\nI wanna verify that this is opened,\nof course, and\n\n138\n00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.500\nthat we are connected to Exchange.\n\n139\n00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.594\nIf you do happen to leave this\nrunning like I do sometimes.\n\n140\n00:07:52.594 --> 00:07:57.238\nYou might end up seeing if you haven't\nbeen using it in a while that it ends up\n\n141\n00:07:57.238 --> 00:07:58.582\nchanging to broken.\n\n142\n00:07:58.582 --> 00:08:01.518\nAnd that means you're gonna have to run\nand make sure that you're connected again.\n\n143\n00:08:01.518 --> 00:08:06.600\nOnce we're actually connected, that means\nwe are now ready to run the commands.\n\n144\n00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.882\nSince I created a room\nmailbox using the WebUI,\n\n145\n00:08:11.882 --> 00:08:19.554\nnow from the PowerShell command I\nwanna go ahead and run new mailbox.\n\n146\n00:08:19.554 --> 00:08:21.566\nThis time, we're gonna give it a name and\n\n147\n00:08:21.566 --> 00:08:24.220\nI'm going to choose a sports\ncar is what I'm gonna do.\n\n148\n00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.199\nAnd the key here is making sure\nyou put this in what you create.\n\n149\n00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:31.024\nAs far as the name goes,\nyou put it into quotes.\n\n150\n00:08:31.024 --> 00:08:35.370\nAnd I think that we'll say that\nthis is Cherokee's favorite,\n\n151\n00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.978\nwhich is a Porsche that\nshe'll actually want to do.\n\n152\n00:08:38.978 --> 00:08:45.419\nAnd then of course, instead of marking\nas a -Room, we'll mark it as -Equipment.\n\n153\n00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:47.381\nNow this does happen, right?\n\n154\n00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:51.456\nCompanies do have company cars or\nfleet cars that they assign and\n\n155\n00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:54.632\nyou of course can also use\nthis in that manner too.\n\n156\n00:08:54.632 --> 00:08:59.399\nA lot of times of course it may not\nbe something like this but you can.\n\n157\n00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:02.435\nUsually, it's things like projectors or\nTV sets,\n\n158\n00:09:02.435 --> 00:09:06.782\npodiums that need to be what they are,\nbecause not every single company has\n\n159\n00:09:06.782 --> 00:09:09.165\na podium for every single room, or-\n&gt;&gt; Or,\n\n160\n00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:12.467\nnot every single company has a Porsche for\nevery single employee.\n\n161\n00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:16.073\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, we're not on,\nwhat is it, Techno-Cribs or\n\n162\n00:09:16.073 --> 00:09:17.391\nwhatever that thing is?\n\n163\n00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:18.543\nThat show?\n\n164\n00:09:18.543 --> 00:09:19.411\n&gt;&gt; I don't know that show.\n\n165\n00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:21.047\n&gt;&gt; So-\n&gt;&gt; You don't know that show?\n\n166\n00:09:21.047 --> 00:09:21.638\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n167\n00:09:21.638 --> 00:09:24.027\n&gt;&gt; Well, where have you been?\n\n168\n00:09:24.027 --> 00:09:27.201\nYou gotta be where the cool kids\nare if you're gonna do this.\n\n169\n00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:32.960\nSo, yeah, once this ends up running here\nit should end up creating that equipment.\n\n170\n00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.493\nWhat we should end up doing.\n\n171\n00:09:34.493 --> 00:09:36.507\nSo, while we're doing this,\n\n172\n00:09:36.507 --> 00:09:40.778\nlet's check back on to see if\neverything is completed over here.\n\n173\n00:09:40.778 --> 00:09:45.652\nAnd there you see conference room A,\nit is now complete, everything is done and\n\n174\n00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:46.543\nready for us.\n\n175\n00:09:46.543 --> 00:09:50.251\nIf I select conference room A and\nthen click on edit,\n\n176\n00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:54.974\nit's right here where you can see\nsome of the other options that you\n\n177\n00:09:54.974 --> 00:09:59.298\nhave to be able to take a look\nat.Such as booking delegates.\n\n178\n00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:00.652\nWho's going to be able to book this.\n\n179\n00:10:00.652 --> 00:10:03.896\nDifferent options that\nare available as well.\n\n180\n00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:08.300\nAccept or decline booking request\nautomatically if you choose to.\n\n181\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.220\nEmail addresses, currently there's\nthe one that we just created of course.\n\n182\n00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:17.260\nAnd even delegations here\nallows you instead to say\n\n183\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.670\nwho's gonna be able to send on behalf\nof this particular room if we need to.\n\n184\n00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.080\nSo we have all these options that\nyou can set up at some point.\n\n185\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.180\nWe're gonna get in the delegations\nat a little bit later time.\n\n186\n00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.920\nBut that's what we should\nend up seeing there.\n\n187\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.020\nSo here it is at the end and\nit's telling me something here.\n\n188\n00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.550\nIt says something was created.\n\n189\n00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.550\nI can see that a mailbox was created.\n\n190\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.490\nIt says failed to replicate the mailbox,\nPorsche to the site.\n\n191\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.740\nSo it did not like the site here.\n\n192\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.650\nBut it says will be available for\nlogin after 15 minutes.\n\n193\n00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.790\nSo, it's saying look, I'm creating this,\nbut I can't replicate it everywhere yet.\n\n194\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.472\n&gt;&gt; So, are we looking at that 15\nminute cycle for re-replication?\n\n195\n00:10:57.472 --> 00:10:58.413\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n196\n00:10:58.413 --> 00:11:00.428\n&gt;&gt; And that looks like what we are really\n\n197\n00:11:00.428 --> 00:11:04.352\nlooking at so doing it this way it may\ntake us a little bit of time before.\n\n198\n00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:06.866\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] re-replication like\nthat is super super redundant.\n\n199\n00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:07.369\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n200\n00:11:07.369 --> 00:11:10.255\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, excellent [LAUGH].\n\n201\n00:11:10.255 --> 00:11:12.799\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I am not sure what,\n\n202\n00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:14.735\nwhy'd you say that?\n\n203\n00:11:14.735 --> 00:11:17.830\n&gt;&gt; Re-replication, that's what I'm saying.\n\n204\n00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.210\nThat's probably not a real word.\n\n205\n00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n206\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.830\nYeah, I didn't think about that.\n\n207\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.680\nAll right, so let's do get mailbox.\n\n208\n00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.060\nAnd then, I can choose the name here.\n\n209\n00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.290\nSo let's do, oops,\nif I can spell it correctly.\n\n210\n00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.920\nThen let's select some of the attributes.\n\n211\n00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.200\nAnd FL of course is going to be\nan abbreviation for format list.\n\n212\n00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.090\nAnd we're going to tell it to\nreport the name, recipient\n\n213\n00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.820\ndetails, if I can spell\nrecipient recipient Type.\n\n214\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.906\n&gt;&gt; Recipient, receipt, recipe.\n\n215\n00:11:55.906 --> 00:11:57.679\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n216\n00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:58.736\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie.\n\n217\n00:11:58.736 --> 00:12:00.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Woah.\n\n218\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.850\nDetailed and then primary,\nI don't need spaces, do I?\n\n219\n00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.060\nSometimes I never know if I\nneed these spaces or not, but\n\n220\n00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:13.890\nlet me not put them there, since I don't\nhave it in my, primarySMTP address.\n\n221\n00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:21.390\nJust need one and let's run that and see\nif it allows me to do it and there you go.\n\n222\n00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:25.920\nSo now you can see where it did\ncreate the recipient mailbox for\n\n223\n00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.180\nit and it is a equipment mailbox.\n\n224\n00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.740\nAnd that's what we\nnormally need to do right?\n\n225\n00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:35.790\nWe need the ability to Be able to do\nthis from of course the power shell.\n\n226\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.850\nYou can figure out how to\ndo this from the web UI.\n\n227\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.420\nIt allows you to put into place\neverything that you need to\n\n228\n00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.140\nto be able to verify\nthat this is going on.\n\n229\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.610\nThe replication will happen after a while,\nlike it says about 15 minutes.\n\n230\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.580\nBut just kind of remember that, that at\nleast will get you started when you start\n\n231\n00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.800\ntalking about the resource types\nof mailboxes that you can manage.\n\n232\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.920\nMost of the time we don't tend to get\na lot of resources after a while.\n\n233\n00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.010\nBut maybe at the start up at the beginning\nas you're moving into a new company,\n\n234\n00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.630\nyou may set this up.\n\n235\n00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.440\nNew equipment comes on board,\nthat is going to be shared equipment.\n\n236\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.600\nSetting the resource up like this\nis really going to be helpful.\n\n237\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, like you mentioned,\nshared equipment.\n\n238\n00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.820\nWhat about shared mailboxes, Ronnie?\n\n239\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.300\nAre there certain situations where I\nmight want to create a mailbox where\n\n240\n00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.660\nothers can log in?\n\n241\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not necessarily that\nwe're logging in to another mailbox.\n\n242\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:32.900\nBut it allows for someone, instead,\nto essentially send to one mailbox and\n\n243\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.890\nthen have it distributed\nout to others too.\n\n244\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.840\nSo a good example of that would\nbe right here at IT Pro TV,\n\n245\n00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.840\nour support.itprotv email if\nyou have technical issues with\n\n246\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.860\nour website or with any of the apps\nthat you connect to our website.\n\n247\n00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.940\nUsually you can send an email there and\nthat ends up,\n\n248\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.660\nof course, at one of our people's\nsupport desk at some point and another.\n\n249\n00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.510\nAnd so multiple people, what will\nend up happening for them, right,\n\n250\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:08.460\nis that even though they are not\nlogged in to a support at ITProTV\n\n251\n00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:14.020\naccount but what it does,\ntheir also getting those emails as well.\n\n252\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.510\nSo that means if we have three or four,\n\n253\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:21.230\nfive different team members,\nthat are actually monitoring that.\n\n254\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.920\nThey will get that and\nthey will actually be able to see or\n\n255\n00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.970\nhave it assigned to them and\nthat is what will end up happening.\n\n256\n00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.330\nSo it's a great system for us.\n\n257\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.550\nTo essentially say, all right,\n\n258\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.430\none of these six people will get it or\nif all six of these people need it.\n\n259\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.420\nEither Cherokee is gonna have to remember\nevery single one of those email addresses\n\n260\n00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.440\nor she can just send it to this and\n\n261\n00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.710\nthen everyone in that team\nwill also get it, as well.\n\n262\n00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:50.240\nSo that is a usage of the idea of\na shared mailbox that we can app.\n\n263\n00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.560\nThe nice thing about using the shared\nmailbox which is really great and\n\n264\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.150\nthe reason why we don't log\nin to it as well is because\n\n265\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.230\nit is one of those that doesn't\nnecessarily need a login.\n\n266\n00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.900\nYou might wonder, like,\nwhy does that matter?\n\n267\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.700\nBecause if it did,\nmore than likely it would also need\n\n268\n00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.170\nan Office 365 subscription\nwhich is now we're paying for\n\n269\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.240\na subscription to someone\nthat’s really not even there.\n\n270\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.490\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, yes.\n\n271\n00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.520\n&gt;&gt; And so by using a shared mailbox\nthat we don't have to do that.\n\n272\n00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.180\n&gt;&gt; You could kind of piggyback off\nof those preexisting accounts and\n\n273\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.380\njust kind of flow that mail into\nthe inboxes that you want it to go to.\n\n274\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.080\n&gt;&gt; In theory that’s what should happen.\n\n275\n00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.910\nThere are limitations though.\n\n276\n00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:35.900\nIf this mailbox is really active like\na support mailbox system could be,\n\n277\n00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.070\nthere is a limitation for the freeness\nof it and in what I mean by that is\n\n278\n00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:44.860\nif that mailbox gets over 50 Gigs,\nit will now be a charged mailbox.\n\n279\n00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.510\nOr else they'll start charging you\nmoney for the use of that space.\n\n280\n00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:52.490\nFor as long as it's under 50 Gigs, I wanna\nmake sure that I'm saying that right.\n\n281\n00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.932\nThen no license is necessary for\nthe shared mailbox.\n\n282\n00:15:55.932 --> 00:15:57.642\nAnd that makes it nice and\n\n283\n00:15:57.642 --> 00:16:02.213\nit makes it a system that we can\nthink about of being able to use too.\n\n284\n00:16:02.213 --> 00:16:05.782\nNow the other thing that I was reading\nabout that this is kind of a fringe\n\n285\n00:16:05.782 --> 00:16:07.910\nsituation I think that you could have it.\n\n286\n00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.820\nBut another one which I was telling\nCherokee about before the show\n\n287\n00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.970\nis that it may be where somebody\ngets let go from your company and\n\n288\n00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.290\nyou just happen to delete\ntheir user account.\n\n289\n00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.560\nBut what about all the emails that they\nmight of actually been in the middle of\n\n290\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.430\ncorresponding with especially\nthe sales company of some sort, right.\n\n291\n00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.990\nWell what happens to that\nmail box when we do that.\n\n292\n00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.770\nWell when you delete a user’s mailbox it\nessentially gets placed on a temporary\n\n293\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:41.010\nhold for about 30 days but\nit becomes and inactive mailbox, okay.\n\n294\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.400\nNow during those 30 days though\nif nobody uses it and stuff.\n\n295\n00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.180\nAnd we forget totally about it\nthe problem that we'll have is simple.\n\n296\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.560\nIt's after 30 days it\nbecomes permanently deleted.\n\n297\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.570\nSo if there's any valuable\nemail in that box\n\n298\n00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.960\nyou want to make sure it's off\nthe system before that point.\n\n299\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.267\nThe only other way to stop that of\ncourse would be to use something\n\n300\n00:17:01.267 --> 00:17:03.298\nlike E-discoveries, in place hold.\n\n301\n00:17:03.298 --> 00:17:08.156\nOr litigation hold to essentially make\nthat mailbox permanent regardless of\n\n302\n00:17:08.156 --> 00:17:12.430\nwhat the condition is of the account or\nanything like that.\n\n303\n00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.408\nSo that's the only other way to do\nthis without having to worry about.\n\n304\n00:17:15.408 --> 00:17:18.600\nBut with using a shared\nmailbox now we can move that\n\n305\n00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.810\nemail in that shared mailbox temporarily.\n\n306\n00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.480\nAnd then get that mail reassigned too.\n\n307\n00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.340\nSo I saw a scenario like that when\n\n308\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.685\nI was making sure that I\nwas going over these notes.\n\n309\n00:17:28.685 --> 00:17:31.655\nSo it is a situation that we\ncould also consider as well.\n\n310\n00:17:31.655 --> 00:17:33.545\n&gt;&gt; That's actually really\nsmart thing to do Ronnie.\n\n311\n00:17:33.545 --> 00:17:36.645\nAs long as we are within that\nrealm of that 50 gig limitation\n\n312\n00:17:36.645 --> 00:17:37.555\nlike you had mentioned.\n\n313\n00:17:37.555 --> 00:17:40.103\nBut when we're talking\nabout the spare accounts,\n\n314\n00:17:40.103 --> 00:17:44.425\nare there any other kind of catches or\nlimitations that we may experience here?\n\n315\n00:17:44.425 --> 00:17:48.240\n&gt;&gt; There are some limitations\nin terms of the shared mailbox.\n\n316\n00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.970\nOne, is if you're on a Mac computer and\n\n317\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.978\nyou're using Outlook for Mac,\nyou will not be able to access the share.\n\n318\n00:17:53.978 --> 00:17:55.770\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Who would use a Mac computer?\n\n319\n00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who would use a Mac computer?\n\n320\n00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.415\nI don't have a clue who would\nend up using a Mac computer.\n\n321\n00:18:00.415 --> 00:18:02.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you are using Outlook for\n\n322\n00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.830\nMac though,\n\n323\n00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:08.120\nokay, you will not be able to access\nthese shared mailboxes as well, okay?\n\n324\n00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.000\nThe same thing if you are also\nrunning Outlook on mobile,\n\n325\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.670\nokay device is they are not gonna\nbe accessible to you as well.\n\n326\n00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.643\nIn terms of security though,\nthere is a security,\n\n327\n00:18:22.653 --> 00:18:25.111\nKind of gotcha that we have\nto worry about as well.\n\n328\n00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:29.260\nNo encryption on the emails\nsent from a shared mailbox.\n\n329\n00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.739\nSo that is something we\nalso have to remember too.\n\n330\n00:18:31.739 --> 00:18:35.680\nSo if you are getting that\nshared mail box set up,\n\n331\n00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:42.440\nthere is no encrypted email from that\nshared mail box that is going to be had.\n\n332\n00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.690\nSo that is something that you definitely\nwant to make sure that you understand,\n\n333\n00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:51.130\nbefore you say we're going to use\na shared mailbox for super secure things.\n\n334\n00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.560\nIt may not be something\nthat you choose to do.\n\n335\n00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.820\nBecause it is designed to actually\ngo across multiple different people\n\n336\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.290\nwhen the mail gets in there.\n\n337\n00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.850\nSo just remember that too.\n\n338\n00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.610\nAll right, so\nhow do we start to set this up?\n\n339\n00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:09.520\nWell the great thing is inside of the web\nUI it is relatively easy to do so.\n\n340\n00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.910\nI'm simply going to go back to\nthe exchange admin center at this point.\n\n341\n00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.780\nAnd as we take a look right here in\nthe recipient category again, take a look\n\n342\n00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:23.900\nacross the top, notice the different\ncategories here is a link called shared.\n\n343\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:30.440\nNow when we do this notice that\nthere is no shared mail box here.\n\n344\n00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:36.740\nIf I click on the plus sign I can\nnow add in a shared mailbox too.\n\n345\n00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.971\nSo let's say that from here let's say\nthat this is gonna be the support team.\n\n346\n00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:48.470\nAnd then the email address, we'll do\nit just as the way that we have it here\n\n347\n00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:54.282\nwhich is gonna be the support.officepro\ndot, or, yeah officeprodemoco.\n\n348\n00:19:54.282 --> 00:19:57.740\nThen I can click on the plus sign to add\nthe users that are going to be part of\n\n349\n00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.170\nthis team.\n\n350\n00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.334\nSo I can go and add in, and Joey.\n\n351\n00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:05.980\nSo let me just add in Joey at this point\nand we will save Lance for the other one.\n\n352\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.120\nWe're gonna click on, okay.\n\n353\n00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.550\nSo add Joey right in here,\n\n354\n00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:14.930\nhe is going to be a shared mailbox\nuser and then we can click save.\n\n355\n00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.150\nAnd that pretty much is\nas simple as it gets\n\n356\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.970\nwhen you start talking about\ncreating the shared mailbox.\n\n357\n00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:29.226\nSo now as email comes in to support at\nOffice Pro democode.onMicrosoft.com.\n\n358\n00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:33.368\nWhich would be silly but you can do\nit as that is actually saved and\n\n359\n00:20:33.368 --> 00:20:35.450\neverything ready to go.\n\n360\n00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.940\nJoey himself will also get\nemails sent there too.\n\n361\n00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.020\nAnd that way we'll have\nthat ready to go too.\n\n362\n00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.280\nSo you just add in your team members.\n\n363\n00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.460\nAnd of course that's what you can do.\n\n364\n00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.530\nSo like everything else today in Office\n365 it's just taking a little bit of time\n\n365\n00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:52.600\nto get done.\n\n366\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.350\nAnd this is yeah,\nwe're actually starting to see this error.\n\n367\n00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.030\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at the error.\n\n368\n00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.750\nEvery once in a while you may see where\nit's failed to replicate the mailbox.\n\n369\n00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:06.101\nAnd it just says the mailbox will be\navailable for log in about 15 minutes.\n\n370\n00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:07.633\nSo it looks like it's a running.\n\n371\n00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:08.580\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; The same issue.\n\n372\n00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe same issue that we're seeing before.\n\n373\n00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.580\nBut notice it does look like it did\ncreate everything is ready to go.\n\n374\n00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.640\n&gt;&gt; All right Ryan more\nwith some Microsoft exams.\n\n375\n00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.470\nAnd I know they really like to focus\non PowerShell commandlets are we gonna\n\n376\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.480\ntake a look at that this\nparticular execution?\n\n377\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.112\n&gt;&gt; We really are.\n\n378\n00:21:24.112 --> 00:21:27.390\nWe're gonna take a look at of\ncourse not only inside the GUI but\n\n379\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.400\nalso inside the PowerShell.\n\n380\n00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.318\nNow remember that when we go into\nPowerShell it's going to be a little bit\n\n381\n00:21:32.318 --> 00:21:36.511\nmore where we have to type in everything\nto get it set up the way that we need to.\n\n382\n00:21:36.511 --> 00:21:37.340\nSo we need to be a little\nbit more detailed.\n\n383\n00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.890\nSo, we need to be a little\nbit more detailed.\n\n384\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.800\nSo let's switch on over\ninto our PowerShell, and\n\n385\n00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.220\nfrom here we are going to begin.\n\n386\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.867\nNow we do need to do\nthis in a certain order.\n\n387\n00:21:47.867 --> 00:21:51.304\nWe're gonna need of course\na security group so\n\n388\n00:21:51.304 --> 00:21:57.058\nthat we can add that into the shared\nmailbox that we're going to create.\n\n389\n00:21:57.058 --> 00:22:00.250\nCreating the shared security\ngroup is gonna be important,\n\n390\n00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.110\ncuz it's just a best practice, right?\n\n391\n00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.190\nThat we simply create\nthat security group and\n\n392\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.000\nthen we can add that\ninto the shared mailbox.\n\n393\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.770\nThat way if people leave we're not\njust attaching a single email address,\n\n394\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.360\nwhich means we have to go back and\nchange that email address.\n\n395\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.916\nWe just simply remove them from the group.\n\n396\n00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:17.130\nAnd we add somebody else\nin that we need to or\n\n397\n00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:21.170\nwe add in more it doesn't really\nhave to actually affect anything.\n\n398\n00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:22.720\nSo that is what we're gonna need.\n\n399\n00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:28.250\nBut I'm gonna begin instead first\nby creating this new mailbox.\n\n400\n00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.140\nSo this is the first step if I'd do this.\n\n401\n00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.246\nSo this gonna be new mailbox and\n\n402\n00:22:33.246 --> 00:22:38.710\nthe way that we distinguish it as being\nshared is that we actually do a -Shared.\n\n403\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.780\nAnd that way you know that this\nis gonna be a shared mailbox.\n\n404\n00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.930\nHere we're going to give it a name and\nwe will call this one,\n\n405\n00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.751\nlet's do RoadCrew,\njust in case somebody else said.\n\n406\n00:22:49.751 --> 00:22:50.262\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n407\n00:22:50.262 --> 00:22:50.840\n&gt;&gt; That I had.\n\n408\n00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.000\nSo we're gonna call it Roadies,\nbut we'll just call it RoadCrew.\n\n409\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.471\nWe'll, we'll do a RoadCrew.\n\n410\n00:22:55.471 --> 00:22:58.017\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Groupies, it's kind of like a new,\n\n411\n00:22:58.017 --> 00:22:59.820\nnewer term for Roadies, Ronnie.\n\n412\n00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.336\n&gt;&gt; Groupies?\n\n413\n00:23:00.336 --> 00:23:01.453\n&gt;&gt; Groupies.\n\n414\n00:23:01.453 --> 00:23:04.507\n&gt;&gt; Groupies get to work on the set and\nstuff like that now?\n\n415\n00:23:04.507 --> 00:23:05.579\nI did not know that.\n\n416\n00:23:05.579 --> 00:23:10.375\n&gt;&gt; No, groupies are more like fans\nthat go to all the different shows.\n\n417\n00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:11.960\n&gt;&gt; Roadies are actually the RoadCrew.\n\n418\n00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.792\nThey are the ones that setup everything.\n\n419\n00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:15.412\n&gt;&gt; Okay I though they were just fans too.\n\n420\n00:23:15.412 --> 00:23:16.096\n&gt;&gt; No, not.\n\n421\n00:23:16.096 --> 00:23:16.908\nI don't think so.\n\n422\n00:23:16.908 --> 00:23:17.840\nI could be wrong.\n\n423\n00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.805\nI've been wrong before.\n\n424\n00:23:18.805 --> 00:23:19.693\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n425\n00:23:19.693 --> 00:23:20.201\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n\n426\n00:23:20.201 --> 00:23:21.456\n[LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:23:21.456 --> 00:23:23.236\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n428\n00:23:23.236 --> 00:23:24.753\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm getting scared.\n\n429\n00:23:24.753 --> 00:23:26.173\nMaybe I don't know what I'm talking about.\n\n430\n00:23:26.173 --> 00:23:27.300\nIt is possible.\n\n431\n00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.430\nSo I'm just gonna set this up with them.\n\n432\n00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.340\nWe just call this one RoadCrew.\n\n433\n00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.223\nAnd then Roadies and then on the display.\n\n434\n00:23:34.223 --> 00:23:36.219\nI don't think I need, let me make sure.\n\n435\n00:23:36.219 --> 00:23:38.860\nNo, display name, I wanna make\nsure that's actually in quotes.\n\n436\n00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:39.803\nSometimes the quotes matter.\n\n437\n00:23:39.803 --> 00:23:43.267\nSometimes they don't I'm just trying\nto make sure that I get everything\n\n438\n00:23:43.267 --> 00:23:45.270\nthat I need to write here.\n\n439\n00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:49.820\nSo once I do that let's see if it actually\nbalks at me for doing it this way.\n\n440\n00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.510\nSo there it goes.\n\n441\n00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.610\nI have now created this particular\nshared mailbox called RoadCrew.\n\n442\n00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.002\nIt is Roadie as the alias.\n\n443\n00:23:58.002 --> 00:24:02.310\nI should have pluralized it but\nthat'll work for us.\n\n444\n00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.224\nFor right now.\n\n445\n00:24:04.224 --> 00:24:06.439\nWhat we have, and that will work.\n\n446\n00:24:06.439 --> 00:24:09.240\nNow, we want to create\nthat security group.\n\n447\n00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.700\nSo, putting this in the wrong\norder can cause issues,\n\n448\n00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.400\ncuz I know I've done it before.\n\n449\n00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie,\nwe can't use a distribution group,\n\n450\n00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.370\nit has to be a security group here?\n\n451\n00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.700\n&gt;&gt; It had to be a security group.\n\n452\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.847\nAnd so you're probably wondering,\nlike I am, well,\n\n453\n00:24:19.847 --> 00:24:22.390\nRonnie you just typed in\nNew-DistributionGroup.\n\n454\n00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.750\nBut it does need to be a security group.\n\n455\n00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.750\nSo, we're gonna see that this\nis what we use in the syntax.\n\n456\n00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.030\nAnd it's gonna change up here\nin a moment as we do this.\n\n457\n00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:35.340\nSo here on the name,\nwe'll call this one again, road crew.\n\n458\n00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.680\nActually, I wonder if I can use the alias.\n\n459\n00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.520\nLet's see if it'll let me use the alias.\n\n460\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.286\nIt may not, but\nwe'll try here with the alias here.\n\n461\n00:24:45.286 --> 00:24:51.690\nRoadies and then the type is where we go.\n\n462\n00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.660\nSo, if I'm gonna create a security group,\n\n463\n00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.490\nit's here at the end that makes it the\nsecurity group, which is Type Security.\n\n464\n00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.080\nSo if it doesn't like the alias here, I'll\nhave to go back in and type in the name.\n\n465\n00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.800\nI probably should just\nleave it as name here,\n\n466\n00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.600\nand let me do that cuz I think\nthat that will definitely work.\n\n467\n00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.153\nTry not to get in as much red\non my screen as I normally have.\n\n468\n00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.420\nAnd we'll see.\n\n469\n00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.340\nNow, it tells me that the object has\nfailed, because it already exists.\n\n470\n00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:26.230\nSo, lets try-\n&gt;&gt; Groupies.\n\n471\n00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.966\n&gt;&gt; You wanna groupies?\n\n472\n00:25:26.966 --> 00:25:29.050\nAll right, we'll do groupies.\n\n473\n00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.290\nLet's see what happens.\nThere you go.\n\n474\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.915\nOkay, so groupies instead.\n\n475\n00:25:32.915 --> 00:25:35.680\nThat's gonna be weird, but sure, why not?\n\n476\n00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.078\nSo now, we actually have that security or\nthe groupies that we've set up.\n\n477\n00:25:40.078 --> 00:25:42.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, now,\nthat we've created that security group,\n\n478\n00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.880\nhow can we attach it to our mailbox?\n\n479\n00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.494\n&gt;&gt; We definitely need to make\nsure that we can do this.\n\n480\n00:25:47.494 --> 00:25:51.206\nSo that we will essentially combine\ntogether that security group and\n\n481\n00:25:51.206 --> 00:25:55.686\nof course the shared mailbox since they're\njust pretty much two different objects\n\n482\n00:25:55.686 --> 00:25:56.580\nright now.\n\n483\n00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.420\nLet me go ahead and clear off the screen\na little bit, and that way we'll\n\n484\n00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.970\nstart up here instead of partway down the\nscreen and some of the different things.\n\n485\n00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:09.663\nNow, if I want to essentially add them\ntogether, I need to add permissions here.\n\n486\n00:26:09.663 --> 00:26:15.900\nSo if I add in the mailbox permissions.\n\n487\n00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:23.470\nNow, there is a mailbox folder permission\nand that is not the right one.\n\n488\n00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.918\nSo make sure that if you're doing this,\n\n489\n00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:29.086\nif you start off like this\nwhere it's add mailbox and\n\n490\n00:26:29.086 --> 00:26:34.070\nyou can actually see where you'ill be able\nto use the tab to actually fill that in.\n\n491\n00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:39.120\nSo, if you do the tab fill make sure\nyou go past the mail folder permission\n\n492\n00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.770\nuntil you hit the add\nmailbox permission here.\n\n493\n00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.050\nAnd once you do so,\nwe need to add in for the user.\n\n494\n00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.510\nAnd this is gonna be RoadCrew, I believe.\n\n495\n00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.450\nIs what that's gonna be.\n\n496\n00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.840\nAnd we're now gonna sign\nsome access rights.\n\n497\n00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:01.620\nFull access is what we're going\nto give it and inheritance type.\n\n498\n00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.516\nInheritance which I can't say.\n\n499\n00:27:03.516 --> 00:27:06.605\nInheritance type, all.\n\n500\n00:27:11.855 --> 00:27:16.717\nSo, once it does that, now, it's saying\nhey look, here's what you're doing,\n\n501\n00:27:16.717 --> 00:27:19.810\nyou're combining the RoadCrew\nalong with what?\n\n502\n00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.285\nWhat am I trying to do here?\n\n503\n00:27:21.285 --> 00:27:25.643\nAnd it's asking me for the identity for\nwhat I want to tie it to,\n\n504\n00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:30.590\nwhich is gonna be in the mailbox,\nthe shared mailbox called RoadCrew.\n\n505\n00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:35.650\nAnd when I do that,\nthat actually ties everything together.\n\n506\n00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:40.710\nAnd now, we have that merging of\neverything that we need in one spot.\n\n507\n00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:45.590\nSo the security group and\nnow the mailbox merge is altogether.\n\n508\n00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.900\nAnd let's see if that actually\ntook place immediately or\n\n509\n00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.220\nis it gonna take a little bit more\ntime before it actually stays there.\n\n510\n00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.809\nSo Roadies just appeared here and\nif I edit.\n\n511\n00:27:59.775 --> 00:28:02.850\nAnd now,\nlet's take a look at what we have here.\n\n512\n00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:08.500\nNotice that in the delegation, we added\nin Groupies, Roadies was here as well.\n\n513\n00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.250\nThere it is, not logged into.\n\n514\n00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.840\nI'm trying to see if there's anything\nelse I need to show on here.\n\n515\n00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.408\nI don't think so.\n\n516\n00:28:16.408 --> 00:28:18.710\nMember of and the group.\n\n517\n00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:19.430\nBut there we go.\nSo\n\n518\n00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:24.342\nthere was the Groupies that we added\nin that time to everything here on\n\n519\n00:28:24.342 --> 00:28:31.160\nthe actual shared folder\nalong with the groups.\n\n520\n00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.370\nIf I do a refresh here,\n\n521\n00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:38.390\nI should see the Groupies that\nCherokee allowed me to make too.\n\n522\n00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:41.480\nSo, that is what we have tied together and\n\n523\n00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.440\nthat will give us the shared\nfolder that we want.\n\n524\n00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.870\nDo remember that in the PowerShell itself,\nright?\n\n525\n00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:54.590\nIt is gonna take both of those parts and\nthen to tie them together as well.\n\n526\n00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.020\nIf you leave one off,\nit's not going to work.\n\n527\n00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.150\nThe other thing especially in this matter,\n\n528\n00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.130\nmake sure you create them\nin the correct order.\n\n529\n00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:06.870\nCreate the mailbox first and\nthen the security group and\n\n530\n00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.470\nthen when you run that other\ncommand it will tie it together.\n\n531\n00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.220\nEvery once in a while on the exam,\n\n532\n00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.950\nit's not gonna be enough just that you\nknow what commands need to be done.\n\n533\n00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.410\nBut that you do them in the proper order.\n\n534\n00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:23.000\nIf you create the security group first,\nand then you happen to do what I do,\n\n535\n00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000\ntrying to keep names consistent,\nit's going to balk at you.\n\n536\n00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.410\nIt's not gonna do what you want it to do.\n\n537\n00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.150\nSo, just be very careful\nthere when you do that.\n\n538\n00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:35.360\nSo my recommendation is,\nmake sure you do them in the order.\n\n539\n00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.360\nMailbox, then security group,\nthen tie them together, okay?\n\n540\n00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.110\n&gt;&gt; Good point, Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; And that will help us out.\n\n541\n00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.210\n&gt;&gt; And doing them in that sequential\norder, you might even, I don't know.\n\n542\n00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:47.538\nI've encountered uniquely\nstructured questions on the exam.\n\n543\n00:29:47.538 --> 00:29:49.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so is that it for\n\n544\n00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.960\nthis particular episode?\n\n545\n00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.410\nWe've taken a look at our different\ntypes of shared mailboxes.\n\n546\n00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:58.760\nWe also saw how to manage our resource\nmailboxes in both the GUI and\n\n547\n00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.960\nwith our command line interface\nusing PowerShell there.\n\n548\n00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.650\n&gt;&gt; You know, there's definitely\na lot more to go in terms of\n\n549\n00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.750\neverything else that we need to do.\n\n550\n00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.960\nBut for this episode,\nwe are pretty much out of time.\n\n551\n00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.140\nWhich means we'll need to\ngo into a different part.\n\n552\n00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you for\njoining us today Ronnie.\n\n553\n00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:17.080\nAnd Ladies and Gentlemen, stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n554\n00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.260\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n555\n00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.040\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n556\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n557\n00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.062\n&gt;&gt; See ya next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n558\n00:30:25.062 -->

00:00:08.258\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:11.877\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:15.920\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.240\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.100\nAnd this is, Enabling Office 365 Services,\nPart Two, as we configure contacts and\n\n8\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.990\nresources with our IT professional Ronnie\nWong, Ronnie, good to see you again.\n\n9\n00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.480\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show, Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.240\nGreat to be here as we're\ncontinuing on in this part two.\n\n11\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.560\nThere's a lot more information\nthat we have to understand\n\n12\n00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.600\nespecially when we start talking\nabout configuration and management.\n\n13\n00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.690\nSo, if you are getting ready for that exam\nas well and administrating Office 365,\n\n14\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.240\nyou are in the perfect place as we\ncontinue in this particular topic.\n\n15\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.970\nIn part one we did show you\njust a little bit, right?\n\n16\n00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.260\nWe showed you, of course,\n\n17\n00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.900\nhow you can change someone's domain\naddress adding in that second part.\n\n18\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.070\nAnd you can do that fairly easily.\n\n19\n00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.900\nBut then if you have multiple users to\ndo that, we showed you it's a little bit\n\n20\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.400\nmore programmatic, where you had to add in\na lot of information to do that as well.\n\n21\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.210\nThen of course, we also showed you how\nyou could do just a few other things.\n\n22\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.670\nBut, now, we also have to move into\nthe realm of other resources, right?\n\n23\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.150\nSo, an email address is\na great resource that\n\n24\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.990\neverybody in our organization's gonna need\nto have tor their basic communication.\n\n25\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.360\nIt is the lifeblood of most companies,\nin terms of communication.\n\n26\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.940\nSo, getting that setup correctly,\nmaking sure that people can email me.\n\n27\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.040\nAnd not accidentally deleting that, or\n\n28\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.700\nmessing it up,\nis really a good thing for us.\n\n29\n00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.190\nBut, now, we're moving into the realm\nof contacts is what we're moving into.\n\n30\n00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.038\nAnd so, this is where we\nneed to also be careful, and\n\n31\n00:01:44.038 --> 00:01:48.682\nneed to understand how to setup\ncontacts in Office 365 too.\n\n32\n00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:52.360\nSo, we're gonna be creating some\nexternal contacts at this point.\n\n33\n00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.380\nAnd this is gonna be that other resource\nthat we need to make sure that as we get\n\n34\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.210\nstarted here, that you understand\nhow to do it inside of the web UI,\n\n35\n00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.080\nthe web user interface as well\nas in the PowerShell command.\n\n36\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.070\nSo, we're gonna be showing you both\noptions in what we're gonna be doing.\n\n37\n00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.802\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, how are context different\nthan email addresses inside of, you know,\n\n38\n00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:14.744\nOffice 365?\n\n39\n00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:17.120\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's a good question as we begin.\n\n40\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.920\nSometimes it's very easy to\nkind of think about, well,\n\n41\n00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.800\nnormally if I take a look at my own email\naddress book, it includes email addresses.\n\n42\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.820\nSo, what makes a contact different?\n\n43\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.560\nWell, a regular email address as far\nas we're concerned in Office 365,\n\n44\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.140\nwhen we're configuring it, is probably\nsomebody within out own organization.\n\n45\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.230\nBut if I now need to be able to contact,\nsomebody else through another\n\n46\n00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.090\nemail address as prime not a part\nof my organization, that mean,\n\n47\n00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.402\nI don't really have a structure out\nthere that allows me to just go,\n\n48\n00:02:47.402 --> 00:02:51.490\nall right, I know, I'm going to be\nemailing somebody else in another company.\n\n49\n00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.160\nWell, that means, I have to go ahead and\nknow exactly their entire email address,\n\n50\n00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.270\nor what if I already had\nthat existing somewhere?\n\n51\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.540\nHow do I get that to a point where\nI can use that with my current\n\n52\n00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.790\nemail system that I have\nin place as just Exchange?\n\n53\n00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.570\nThat's what we wanna show you right\nnow and make sure that you understand.\n\n54\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.100\nSo, we're gonna take you through\nthe web UI first, the user interface.\n\n55\n00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.550\nSo, we understand how you do this, and\n\n56\n00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.870\nthen we'll take a look of course at\nthe power show configuration too.\n\n57\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.960\nSo, let's go and\ntake a look at my computer and\n\n58\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.430\nthis will help us out as we begin.\n\n59\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.170\nSo, if I'm going to start to\ncreate some different contacts,\n\n60\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.260\nwe've gotta think about\nit in a couple of ways.\n\n61\n00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.050\nBut this is kinda the easiest way.\n\n62\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.080\nMost of us are gonna be familiar with\nif we've actually been managing e-mails\n\n63\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.320\nsystems at all.\n\n64\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.680\nSo, here inside of the Office Admin\ncenter as you see,\n\n65\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.460\nI need to go into\nthe exchange admin center.\n\n66\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.040\nFor us that's going to be over here on\nthe left hand side as I scroll down\n\n67\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.580\nI'm looking for well this icon.\n\n68\n00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.990\nThe little tiny a that we see.\n\n69\n00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.792\nNow, if you have a different\nscreen resolution,\n\n70\n00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:57.880\nmine is kind of dropped really low so that\nyou can see it without having to squint.\n\n71\n00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.750\nBut if you see yours,\nyou'll probably end up seeing where\n\n72\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.230\nit has admin centers like beside it,\nlet me go ahead and try that again.\n\n73\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.230\nAdmin centers right beside it, but I'm\ngonna look for Exchange is the first one.\n\n74\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.220\nThat's gonna be my Exchange Admin Center,\n\n75\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.890\nusually people abbreviate it as EAC\nas what you also end up hearing.\n\n76\n00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.530\nThen as we take a look on the left\nhand side I have this navigation pane,\n\n77\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.900\nthat of course I have grouped\ncategorically over here too.\n\n78\n00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.550\nI'm going to select recipients.\n\n79\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.350\nAnd, now, inside of the recipient,\n\n80\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.550\nyou can see the current\nmailboxes in my organization.\n\n81\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.113\nNow, Zach, do these names by\nchance look familiar at all?\n\n82\n00:04:37.113 --> 00:04:39.207\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say,\nJustin Timberlake is right on that list.\n\n83\n00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:40.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes he is.\n\n84\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.570\nJustin Timberlake,\nLance Bass, Joey Fatone.\n\n85\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.690\nAs you start seeing this you're probably\nsaying, Ronnie, you must love boy bands.\n\n86\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.930\nIt's not that I love boy bands.\n\n87\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.560\nThis is the organization\nthat was set up for us.\n\n88\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.330\nSo, this is who we have.\n\n89\n00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.300\nSo, each one of them has\ntheir own email address.\n\n90\n00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.860\nBut what if we also wanted\nto add in some contacts for\n\n91\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.970\nthose email addresses there too?\n\n92\n00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.710\nWell, notice up here on the top,\nI can just simply scroll over and\n\n93\n00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.150\nyou'll see right here at the top\nwhere it says, Contacts.\n\n94\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.130\nIf I select Contacts, it's here that\nI can add in essentially contacts for\n\n95\n00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.160\na global address book,\nis what it comes down to.\n\n96\n00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.300\nAnybody in my organization\ncan also get access to this.\n\n97\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.220\nNow, personally though on that one\nindividual, so let us take, for example,\n\n98\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.150\nJustin Timberlake, since that is the one\nthat you have really did mention and\n\n99\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.890\nyou seem to know the name of,\nso that is good.\n\n100\n00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.750\nHe, of course can have his\nown personal contacts.\n\n101\n00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.910\nIf you want student his own email address,\n\n102\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.947\nhe can have contacts that would\nbe different from Joey's.\n\n103\n00:05:38.947 --> 00:05:43.919\nDifferent from Lance's, and that's fine,\nbut here we wanna add in contacts for\n\n104\n00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.588\nthe entire organization.\n\n105\n00:05:45.588 --> 00:05:49.658\nAnd it's easy as trying to take a look\nat these different icons, and so,\n\n106\n00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:53.130\nZach, even if you don't know\nanything about Office 365,\n\n107\n00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.563\nif I were to say, hey, I need to add\na contact and you're writing in contacts.\n\n108\n00:05:57.563 --> 00:06:01.294\nTake a look at these icons, which one do\nyou think it should be if I select, say,\n\n109\n00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.100\nI'm gonna add in a contact?\n\n110\n00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.640\n&gt;&gt; Plus.\n\n111\n00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think,\nthat you are absolutely right.\n\n112\n00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.620\nSo, you would think,\nthat that's exactly what you do.\n\n113\n00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.420\nYou select right there at the plus, and\nthere's a little drop down arrow and\n\n114\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.480\nI select mail contact, and there it is.\n\n115\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.700\nNow, we simply just fill this out with\nthe information that we're given here.\n\n116\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.300\nAnd we really need to pay attention to\nthe ones that have asterisks in them.\n\n117\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.950\nOkay.\n\n118\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.810\nNotice it doesn't really require first\nname and last name if I don't want to.\n\n119\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.787\nI can simply just have a display name,\nan alias and an email address, and\n\n120\n00:06:32.787 --> 00:06:35.001\nthat's all that I really need.\n\n121\n00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:39.226\nNow, organizations will be different about\nthis depending on how much information you\n\n122\n00:06:39.226 --> 00:06:40.990\nreally want to put in here.\n\n123\n00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.110\nSome organizations like it,\n\n124\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.320\nwhere it really is only the email\naddress and a display name, so\n\n125\n00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.070\nthat people can see it in a list and\nsort alphabetically if they want to.\n\n126\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.770\n&gt;&gt; Less is more.\n\n127\n00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and sometimes it is.\n\n128\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.550\nSometimes it is the very\nfact that less is more.\n\n129\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.990\nBecause we might not really\nneed anything else in this, but\n\n130\n00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.590\nif you do need more information,\nwell, all of a sudden, Zack,\n\n131\n00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.090\nyou start seeing something, there really\nisn't a lot more that I can add in here.\n\n132\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.702\nWhat if I needed like phone numbers and\nstreet addresses, and\n\n133\n00:07:11.702 --> 00:07:17.571\nall that information, it doesn't look\nlike it globally allows me to do that.\n\n134\n00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:21.768\nI might be able to get first name initials\nand last name and display name, but\n\n135\n00:07:21.768 --> 00:07:24.670\ndoing this right here,\nit doesn't seem like a lot.\n\n136\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.980\nSo, let's go ahead and\nwe'll make you do the first contact.\n\n137\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.145\nSo, we're gonna say, Zach and\nthen we'll even do that, Memos.\n\n138\n00:07:32.145 --> 00:07:32.936\n&gt;&gt; Meos.\n\n139\n00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:33.696\n&gt;&gt; Meos.\n\n140\n00:07:33.696 --> 00:07:35.047\n&gt;&gt; M-E-M-O-S.\n\n141\n00:07:35.047 --> 00:07:35.900\n&gt;&gt; And there we go.\n\n142\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.460\nAnd then on the alias here,\nwe just say, Zach again.\n\n143\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:47.500\nZach@itpro.tv right now,\nand we click save.\n\n144\n00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.897\nAnd it will now add in a contact\nin our global address book.\n\n145\n00:07:52.897 --> 00:07:57.023\nSo, it may just take a moment for\nut to do this, but fairly simple,\n\n146\n00:07:57.023 --> 00:08:01.691\nfairly easy to be able to do, follow\nthe instructions, doing it this way.\n\n147\n00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:04.292\nNot exactly the most\ndifficult thing in the world.\n\n148\n00:08:04.292 --> 00:08:07.164\nYou can see why this would be\nthe preferred method to do,\n\n149\n00:08:07.164 --> 00:08:10.460\na lot of everything that we\nwant to be able to do in here.\n\n150\n00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.230\nSo there it goes, and\nnow you are an official contact\n\n151\n00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:19.030\ninside of\nMy Office Pro Democo Organization.\n\n152\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.850\nAnd now, if I select the pencil to edit,\nlet's see what else.\n\n153\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:29.190\nNow, it's only in here that I can go back\nin after I've created the initial portion.\n\n154\n00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.980\nNotice now, I can add in\nadditional contact information and\n\n155\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:38.220\neven the organization that I want\nthem to add into if I wanted to.\n\n156\n00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.890\nSo I have to essentially\nkind of create it and\n\n157\n00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.840\nthen I can go back in an edit and\nadd some more information.\n\n158\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.160\nSo notice it is still a two-step\nprocess if we do this.\n\n159\n00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.080\nSo fairly easy, fairly intuitive in that\nway, once you figure out where it is.\n\n160\n00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.780\nThat's kind of the hard part is\nif you're already studying for\n\n161\n00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.530\nthe exam, hopefully,\nyou are preparing by getting into this and\n\n162\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.700\nlooking at it and\nseeing where everything is.\n\n163\n00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.160\nBut if you're not, you need to know that.\n\n164\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.490\nSo go back in, take your test account.\n\n165\n00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.280\nMake sure you know where\nthese things are going to be.\n\n166\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.950\nBut, normally though when we\nstart adding in contacts,\n\n167\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.310\nit's not that we add\none contact at a time.\n\n168\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:21.170\nIt may be where I go, look,\nI have 10 or 15 contacts at a time.\n\n169\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.940\nHow do I begin to do something like that?\n\n170\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.840\nAnd that is where it becomes a little bit\nkey and how that data is stored first.\n\n171\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.480\nThe great thing about exchange and also\nabout what we're doing here with Office\n\n172\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.630\n365 is that we can actually\nimport contacts in\n\n173\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:45.100\nas long as those contacts are stored\nin what we call a CSV file.\n\n174\n00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.750\nThat's a comma separated value file,\n\n175\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.570\nin which every column of information\nis essentially separated by a comma.\n\n176\n00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.100\nAnd the way that that ends up looking,\nhopefully everybody's seen this before,\n\n177\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.090\nbut in case you haven't,\nlet me see if I can show this to you.\n\n178\n00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.302\nOop, that's not the primary one.\n\n179\n00:10:04.302 --> 00:10:06.573\nWhat I wanted, it's the external contacts,\n\n180\n00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:08.969\nthat was the one that was\na little bit different.\n\n181\n00:10:13.516 --> 00:10:16.402\nSo right here,\nyou can see where this top row,\n\n182\n00:10:16.402 --> 00:10:19.010\nI know it's a little bit more difficult.\n\n183\n00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.120\nLet me see if I can zoom in a little bit.\n\n184\n00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.170\nExternal email address, name, first name,\nlast name, street address, city,\n\n185\n00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:30.170\nstate, postal code, phone, mobile phone,\npage, home number, you name it.\n\n186\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.640\nAll that information is stored right here,\nincluding company and\n\n187\n00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.500\nit just wraps around.\n\n188\n00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.350\nThis would all be on one\nline is what we would see.\n\n189\n00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.550\nBut then beginning here on\nwhat we see right here,\n\n190\n00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.650\nis that you actually see that\nthere's a couple of contacts.\n\n191\n00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.740\nThis for Dan Park, for one.\n\n192\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:53.338\nAnd this other one here is for, apparently\nnot Dan Park, but someone else here.\n\n193\n00:10:53.338 --> 00:10:54.706\nPiller, pillar.\n\n194\n00:10:54.706 --> 00:10:55.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Pilar.\n\n195\n00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Pilar is who this one is.\n\n196\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.340\nNow you might be wondering, Ronnie\nwhere the heck did you get these names?\n\n197\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.170\nAnd this is a good one for you.\n\n198\n00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.380\nYou can go onto Microsoft's website,\nusually TechNet,\n\n199\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.500\nand they're actually saying, hey look,\n\n200\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.460\nif you don't know how to do this, here's\na test file for you and that's what I did.\n\n201\n00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.950\nI took their particular test file and\nthat way I said, hey,\n\n202\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.180\nyou wanna practice this before you try it?\n\n203\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.580\nWell of course I do.\n\n204\n00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.830\nI don't wanna have to type\nin all of these information.\n\n205\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.140\nBut as good practice,\nas something that you can do very easily.\n\n206\n00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.350\nGet that information and\n\n207\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:30.300\nsee if that actually comes in as contacts\nin the way that we're talking about.\n\n208\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.260\nAnd if it does it means you\ncan now use this as a default,\n\n209\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.500\nas a kind of Ad Hoc template\nis what I should say.\n\n210\n00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.910\nI can now start typing\nin information here.\n\n211\n00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:44.430\nOr I might find out that the current\nemail system that I'm using\n\n212\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:50.360\ngives me that ability to go and\nfind my contact and say, export as a .csv.\n\n213\n00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.730\nAnd it does,\nit might normally spit out something\n\n214\n00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.250\nas far as the output goes that looks\nsomething very similar to this.\n\n215\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.470\nSo once you have something like this,\n\n216\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.500\nnow you need to make sure that\nyou know where it's stored.\n\n217\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.270\nI know that this one's gonna be stored\ninside of My O365 folder on my C drive,\n\n218\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.320\nand that's what I need to know.\n\n219\n00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.480\nThen, what we can do is we\ncan import it in, okay?\n\n220\n00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.930\nUsing PowerShell if you'll take a look\nat this initial command up here,\n\n221\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.880\nwe're gonna talk about\nthe other ones in a moment.\n\n222\n00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.170\nDown here at the bottom, but\nnotice it says import the CSV.\n\n223\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.530\nAnd I'm telling it, import this one, okay?\n\n224\n00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:32.180\nThe information that's actually\ninside that file I just showed you.\n\n225\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.580\nThen it actually runs a pipe.\n\n226\n00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.220\nEssentially saying, take that and\nnow run these other commands through it,\n\n227\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.696\nwhere it's gonna look for\nall of this information here.\n\n228\n00:12:41.696 --> 00:12:48.170\nNew-MailContact, FirstName,\nDisplayName, ExternalEmailAddress.\n\n229\n00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.320\nAlso FirstName, LastName, you name it.\n\n230\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.030\nAnd saying pull that in.\n\n231\n00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.770\nImport that into my contacts is what\nit's essentially telling it to do.\n\n232\n00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:02.620\nSo that is what I can actually end\nup doing is to import that in for\n\n233\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.330\nthe contacts that I have.\n\n234\n00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.970\nAnd what it's going to do is when it\ntakes a look at this information,\n\n235\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.080\nit's going to end up piping\nit into this new command.\n\n236\n00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.470\nWhich tells me I'm not making\na new mailbox here for\n\n237\n00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.780\nMy Office 365 organization.\n\n238\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.660\nIt is making a new contact\nthat is what it's going to do.\n\n239\n00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.140\nSo that is gonna be very important\nas we start to take a look.\n\n240\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.950\nNow, the reason why I also typed\nthis out is you don't know this,\n\n241\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.300\nbut I'm infamous for\nmy terrible bad typing.\n\n242\n00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.170\nIf anything will fail me on the show,\nit's my typing ability.\n\n243\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.900\nSo a great recommendation here\nis that I have everything and\n\n244\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:47.250\nhopefully if I've typed this incorrectly,\nI can just copy it, then\n\n245\n00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.920\nI can come over here into my PowerShell.\n\n246\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.660\nNow remember, that we also need to\nmake sure that we are connected to\n\n247\n00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.940\nthe Office 365 Exchange Online.\n\n248\n00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.620\nIf you re not connected\nthere it's gonna run and\n\n249\n00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.425\ngo I don't have a clue\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n250\n00:14:05.425 --> 00:14:11.290\nSo, I always like to verify,\nGet PSSession.\n\n251\n00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.910\nAnd you'll notice that a couple\nof things can happen here, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.620\nSo this is how I knew\nbefore I typed it in.\n\n253\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.070\nThat right before the show,\n\n254\n00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:24.322\nI checked and I ended up with\na connection that said broken.\n\n255\n00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:27.210\nNow, this broken,\nit probably means I can't use it.\n\n256\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:31.360\nSo if I can't use it that means me typing\nthat command would have been silly.\n\n257\n00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.100\nBut I simply open up another session and\nnow that I have opened,\n\n258\n00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.240\nnotice it says exchange online,\nor Microsoft Exchange.\n\n259\n00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.370\nMake sure you have that set up and\nit says available.\n\n260\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.840\nIf it's not well then you're not\ngonna be able to run this command.\n\n261\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.810\nSo that is also a key element\nto what we're doing as well.\n\n262\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:51.840\nOkay?\n\n263\n00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.790\nSo, now, I just right clicked,\nand, hopefully,\n\n264\n00:14:54.790 --> 00:15:00.120\nif everything is typed in correctly here,\nthat should allow me to do this.\n\n265\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.140\nSo, there's one of two things.\n\n266\n00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:05.240\nEither I typed it in badly in my notes,\nwhich is very possible, and\n\n267\n00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.530\nif it does,\nit's gonna spit out red marks everywhere.\n\n268\n00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.810\nOkay, if it's done I may not\nget anything at all except for\n\n269\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.510\nthe result that I'm looking for.\n\n270\n00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:18.100\nSo let's see if I have finished,\nappear, there we go.\n\n271\n00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.260\nNow it's asking me for some credentials.\n\n272\n00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.465\nSo I'm simply gonna type in my\ncredentials and there it is,\n\n273\n00:15:25.465 --> 00:15:27.324\nI knew that I mistyped it.\n\n274\n00:15:29.827 --> 00:15:33.500\nSo now, I just have to see if I\ncan type it all back in correctly.\n\n275\n00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.800\nClick OK, and notice what it says.\n\n276\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.740\nA new session for the implicit remoting\nof the new contact command and\n\n277\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.000\nyou'll now notice that there we are.\n\n278\n00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.707\nWe have Dan Park that was added in and\n\n279\n00:15:48.707 --> 00:15:53.906\nPilar Pinilla was also\nadded in as a MailContact.\n\n280\n00:15:53.906 --> 00:15:59.028\nSo, we know that this can work, and\nthis also helps you out because\n\n281\n00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:04.163\nyou're not now having to go to Let\nme see if I can get back to it here.\n\n282\n00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:07.597\nOkay, you're not having to come here and\npress the Enter sign,\n\n283\n00:16:07.597 --> 00:16:10.340\nlet's say, 50 times that for each one.\n\n284\n00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.808\nWhat should happen then is\nthat if I refresh this screen,\n\n285\n00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:19.740\nnow you can see that along with\nZach who we added in manually here\n\n286\n00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.951\nit added in Dan Park And,\nof course, Pilar Pinilla.\n\n287\n00:16:23.951 --> 00:16:28.760\nI'm gonna double-click and\nlet's check on the information, too.\n\n288\n00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.250\nSo there may be additional\ninformation here.\n\n289\n00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.270\nLet's see, no,\nit just filled out all this.\n\n290\n00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.670\nSo I was trying to remember\nwhat it actually filled out but\n\n291\n00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.570\nthere is actually more coming.\n\n292\n00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.240\nLet's say that we have other\nadditional information and\n\n293\n00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.160\nthat's something we also\nneed to think about, too.\n\n294\n00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.660\nSo it's here,\nnow that I have the contacts made.\n\n295\n00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.240\nRemember at the beginning, Zach, when I\nshowed you where we created yours and\n\n296\n00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.835\nstill it didn't fill in that information?\n\n297\n00:16:51.835 --> 00:16:53.604\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not gonna do that for\n\n298\n00:16:53.604 --> 00:16:54.248\nthese either.\n\n299\n00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:56.815\nIt will give me the basic information, but\n\n300\n00:16:56.815 --> 00:17:01.540\nthis contact information I have right\nhere, there's really not a lot there.\n\n301\n00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.930\nBut I can make it fulfill and\nactually do this.\n\n302\n00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:11.500\nOnce the command has actually been fully,\nor the context, excuse me,\n\n303\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:17.550\nhas been created, I can now take this and\nessentially fill it out.\n\n304\n00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:22.560\nSo inside of the ExternalContact.csv,\nI had a lot more information than\n\n305\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.440\nfirst name, last name, and\nan email address, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.540\nI have a lot more information than that.\n\n307\n00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.208\nSo what I'm gonna do this time is\nI'm gonna create a variable, okay,\n\n308\n00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:36.970\nthat's called $Contacts with\nthe dollar sign at the beginning, and\n\n309\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.000\nit's saying, here's what you should do.\n\n310\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.390\nGo ahead and import in what's actually in\nthis file and stored in this variable.\n\n311\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:52.530\nThen take everything that you've now\nstored, and for each record that it sees,\n\n312\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:59.790\nit says to set the contact information and\nadd in the other information here, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.850\nNow if I don't have a contact,\nit's gonna ignore it because yeah,\n\n314\n00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.270\nit's setting the contact.\n\n315\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.480\nIt's not creating the mail\ncontact like we did before.\n\n316\n00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.320\nBut now if I say here is additional\ninformation I need to add in,\n\n317\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.190\nthis is what we are going to do.\n\n318\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.700\nSo I'm gonna run this in a couple of\ndifferent copying and pasting here.\n\n319\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.268\nFirst thing I'm gonna do\nis create that variable.\n\n320\n00:18:24.886 --> 00:18:27.430\nThat was me, I forgot,\n\n321\n00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:32.220\nI needed to add in the full-\n&gt;&gt; And that's when we see the red.\n\n322\n00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.220\n&gt;&gt; That is when we see the red\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n323\n00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:39.350\nthat alerts us to the very fact\nthat you did it incorrectly.\n\n324\n00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:44.710\nAnd for me, I forgot, it actually pasted\nit in as being this current place and\n\n325\n00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:48.230\nlocation where it was stored,\nunder C: &gt; Users &gt; Administrator.\n\n326\n00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.400\nI forgot I had changed it here,\nis what I did.\n\n327\n00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.300\nNow it should be fine.\n\n328\n00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.419\nWell, let me see if I can click on it.\n\n329\n00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.380\nAnd let it create, or maybe, there we go.\n\n330\n00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.666\nNotice now it just accepted it, so it\ncreated it and now that information that's\n\n331\n00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:11.130\ninside that file is stored in my RAM\nunderneath this name as a variable.\n\n332\n00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:18.510\nThen I am going to take this and tell it,\nfor this, when you run through this,\n\n333\n00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:24.660\nfor every record that you find in there,\nset the contact, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.410\nSo now it's gonna go through and set that\ncontact information and it's gonna include\n\n335\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.570\nall the rest of this information\nthat it might find in there as well.\n\n336\n00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.003\nSo this is where I simply\ncopy the whole thing.\n\n337\n00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:43.008\nAnd I paste it in.\n\n338\n00:19:43.008 --> 00:19:46.947\nAnd if this has been copied correctly,\nhopefully it has, and\n\n339\n00:19:46.947 --> 00:19:49.130\nI haven't made any typos.\n\n340\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.700\nAnd that's the key,\nis making sure you don't make typos here.\n\n341\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.370\nAnd I just have to kinda let\nit do its thing here maybe.\n\n342\n00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.574\nI'm trying to make sure I didn't,\nthere we go.\n\n343\n00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:02.180\nIt just took a moment before anything.\n\n344\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.690\nAnd now notice I'm back at that blinking\ninsertion point which says hey,\n\n345\n00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.620\ndid you do anything.\n\n346\n00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.170\nHow do I know if everything's\nactually done here?\n\n347\n00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.760\nWell, we can check it\nout in a very easy way.\n\n348\n00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.490\nI'm gonna go back into\nthe web user interface.\n\n349\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:21.720\nFrom here, I'm going to refresh, make sure\nthat all the information's refreshed.\n\n350\n00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.530\nI should be able to select Dan Park.\n\n351\n00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.020\nAnd once I bring up\nDan Park's information,\n\n352\n00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.960\nI can select Contact Information.\n\n353\n00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.020\nAnd now, Zach, you can see, I didn't\nhave to type in any of this information.\n\n354\n00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.770\nIt went ahead and it filled it in for me.\n\n355\n00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:36.470\n&gt;&gt; Populated it, yeah.\n\n356\n00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:40.770\n&gt;&gt; So this is a nice confirmation\nin terms of what we're doing here\n\n357\n00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:45.100\nto really help us out to be able\nto add this information in here\n\n358\n00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.690\nwithout me having to type in\nevery single one of these.\n\n359\n00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.030\nIf it's already been done before\neven in another email system, and\n\n360\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.420\nit gives me the ability\nto export this as a CSV.\n\n361\n00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.910\nThe only thing I really have to do is try\nto figure out what are these titles and\n\n362\n00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.040\nhow do I make that convert\nin that system set?\n\n363\n00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.940\nI don't use state/province,\nI just call it state.\n\n364\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.220\nYou just have to go and\nyour rename on that header row.\n\n365\n00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.850\nYou call it State/Province, or whatever it\nmight be, and that will help you out and\n\n366\n00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.880\nfigure that out for you and\nallow you to do what you need to.\n\n367\n00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.590\nSo fairly simple but\n\n368\n00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:23.800\nvery powerful because now we do have\ncompany-wide contacts that we need.\n\n369\n00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.290\nIt's done and\nit is set up very easily right here.\n\n370\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.380\nSo being able to do something\nlike that really does help us out\n\n371\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.600\nwhen we start to take a look.\n\n372\n00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.720\nNow, there is some other information\nthat we need to know about as well.\n\n373\n00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.170\nSo, Dan, there it is.\n\n374\n00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.650\nWe have now setup our, not Dan, sorry.\n\n375\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.422\nZach, we've set up Dan's information.\n\n376\n00:21:44.422 --> 00:21:48.895\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] We've\nnow setup Dan's information.\n\n377\n00:21:48.895 --> 00:21:51.240\nBut do you see a limitation here?\n\n378\n00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.369\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like there's\nonly one single space for\n\n379\n00:21:55.369 --> 00:21:57.920\nemail address for the contacts.\n\n380\n00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.550\nWhat if I have a contact that has\nmultiple addresses, email addresses?\n\n381\n00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:03.870\n&gt;&gt; And that happens, right?\n\n382\n00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.410\nEvery once in a while what will happen,\n\n383\n00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.440\nlet's say for an example,\nZach, is that an individual,\n\n384\n00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.900\nlet's say like Dan here, worked for his\norganization but his organization may be\n\n385\n00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.460\nin the middle of a transition where\nanother company has bought him out.\n\n386\n00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:21.134\nAnd now he's really having email coming\nfrom or coming into two different\n\n387\n00:22:21.134 --> 00:22:24.310\nemail addresses because of the new\ncompany that's buying it and\n\n388\n00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.260\nhis old company that has\nhis existing email address.\n\n389\n00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.070\nAnd we now need to add in\nanother email address.\n\n390\n00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.220\nWell, you can tell right here,\nit is set up, but\n\n391\n00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:39.790\nnotice it's only set up for\none email address to allow us to do that.\n\n392\n00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:46.190\nSo if I do have multiple email addresses,\nthe GUI, or the web user interface,\n\n393\n00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:50.090\nright, that we have right here is\nnot gonna be a situation for us.\n\n394\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:55.020\nIf that happens,\nyou only have the resource that you have\n\n395\n00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.250\nis gonna be doing it by typing\nit in through the PowerShell.\n\n396\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.620\nAnd that is something that\nwe definitely need to know.\n\n397\n00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:07.070\nAnd it sounds like a good point of\nwhere an exam writer might go, this is\n\n398\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:13.070\nsomething that if you haven't tried to do\nthis, you're probably going to miss this,\n\n399\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.430\nexcuse me, not mess this up, you're\nprobably gonna miss this on the exam.\n\n400\n00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.480\nSo you can see why this is important.\n\n401\n00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.460\nIf you do happen to see something like\nthat where they're saying you need to add\n\n402\n00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.360\nin multiple email addresses for\n\n403\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.560\nan external contact, well,\nyou can't do it through the web UI.\n\n404\n00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.860\nYou've got to go into\nPowerShell to do that.\n\n405\n00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.240\nAnd so we're gonna, of course, show you\nhow to do that right now to help us out.\n\n406\n00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.150\nSo the first thing that we want to\ndo is we wanna run a command here\n\n407\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.180\ncalled get mailContact.\n\n408\n00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:48.901\nAnd let's pick here on,\nwe'll do Dan Park cuz I can remember that.\n\n409\n00:23:48.901 --> 00:23:52.036\nI don't think I can spell\nPinar Pinilla very easily.\n\n410\n00:23:52.036 --> 00:23:53.498\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pinar, Pinar.\n\n411\n00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:56.831\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'm gonna pick Dan Park.\n\n412\n00:23:59.616 --> 00:24:04.239\nSometimes you have to put them in\nParentheses if you have a space in\n\n413\n00:24:04.239 --> 00:24:05.004\nbetween.\n\n414\n00:24:05.004 --> 00:24:07.020\nSo let's see if it actually box at me or\nnot.\n\n415\n00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:07.950\nThere we go.\n\n416\n00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:12.130\nSo, I could have use the alias if I\nremember that it was actually kind of\n\n417\n00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.980\nall concatenated together here.\n\n418\n00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.769\nBut notice that it did pull it up so,\n\n419\n00:24:15.769 --> 00:24:17.984\nI need to make sure that\nI have that contact.\n\n420\n00:24:17.984 --> 00:24:24.390\nNow, once I have that contact there, I now\nneed to go ahead and add in email address.\n\n421\n00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.330\nNow, you are gonna see something and\nI need to make sure that I emphasize this,\n\n422\n00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.510\nand I'll do it again here in a moment, and\n\n423\n00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.080\nwe'll test that out cuz I just\nthought of something here.\n\n424\n00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:38.560\nI just need to do Set MailContact now,\n\n425\n00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.520\nI am going to select the name.\n\n426\n00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.810\nThis time we're gonna try a DanPark.\n\n427\n00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.098\nLet's see if it actually allows\nme to use the alias here.\n\n428\n00:24:46.098 --> 00:24:49.259\n-EmailAddresses.\n\n429\n00:24:50.904 --> 00:24:55.694\nAnd then the email addresses,\nI'm gonna start with a quote,\n\n430\n00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:57.920\n\"SMTP in capital letters.\n\n431\n00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.586\nNow, I can type in the email address,\nand this is where I\n\n432\n00:25:01.586 --> 00:25:05.954\nreally have to kind of go back and\nmake sure that I do this one right,\n\n433\n00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:09.910\nbecause I really don't\nremember his email address.\n\n434\n00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.990\nSo let me check, let me go back in here.\n\n435\n00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.441\nThat's where I was trying to go.\n\n436\n00:25:14.441 --> 00:25:20.952\nAnd this one was danp@fabriKam,\nthat's what I needed, danp@fabrikam.\n\n437\n00:25:20.952 --> 00:25:28.319\ndanp@fabrikam.com, at least\nI hope that's what it said.\n\n438\n00:25:30.502 --> 00:25:32.271\nYup, fabrikam.com.\n\n439\n00:25:35.471 --> 00:25:38.910\nNow, that is his primary email address.\n\n440\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:44.320\nIf I want to add in a secondary email\naddress, I can simply type in a comma.\n\n441\n00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:49.340\nOops, I need to close\noff the quotes first.\n\n442\n00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:55.349\nThen, I can type in a And\nthen in lowercase,\n\n443\n00:25:55.349 --> 00:25:59.860\nsmtp, I can now add in\nanother email address here.\n\n444\n00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:07.662\nSo we'll do this one as danp@ Oops,\nI'll try.\n\n445\n00:26:07.662 --> 00:26:08.330\nI zoomed in.\n\n446\n00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.945\nI was gonna say, why is that not working?\n\n447\n00:26:09.945 --> 00:26:18.072\ndanp@, we'll call it, fabrikom.com.\n\n448\n00:26:18.072 --> 00:26:21.668\nI dunno, just making up something cuz\nI don't know of another email address\n\n449\n00:26:21.668 --> 00:26:22.810\nright now.\n\n450\n00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.680\nSo, there it is.\n\n451\n00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.250\nRemember that we've seen this\nin previous episodes here,\n\n452\n00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.470\nwe're inside of the Exchange mailbox.\n\n453\n00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:36.360\nWhat we'll end up seeing here is, that,\nwhen it's all in capital letters,\n\n454\n00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.101\nthat indicates the primary address,\nwhen see smtp in lower case letters,\n\n455\n00:26:41.101 --> 00:26:43.900\nthat indicates a secondary address for us.\n\n456\n00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.310\nSo in other words,\nanother address that we can add in.\n\n457\n00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.800\nOnce I've gotten that in here,\nI can now press enter and\n\n458\n00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.490\nnow, let's see if it accepts it.\n\n459\n00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.570\nSo here we go,\nit looks like it accepted it,\n\n460\n00:26:55.570 --> 00:27:00.160\nlet me go back into the mail contact here.\n\n461\n00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.370\nOops, wrong one.\n\n462\n00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.390\nLet me get back to the other one.\n\n463\n00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.910\nYou always have to refresh\nthis cuz if you don't,\n\n464\n00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.340\nit don't actually take the information.\n\n465\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.206\nNow, let's take a look at Dan Park's name.\n\n466\n00:27:12.152 --> 00:27:15.544\nAnd let's see if it actually\nadds it in for us here.\n\n467\n00:27:16.778 --> 00:27:18.040\nIt may not even show up.\n\n468\n00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.980\nSee, that's one of\nthe things I wasn't sure of.\n\n469\n00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.360\nBut if it doesn't show up here,\nI was hoping that it would just show up.\n\n470\n00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.840\nWhat I was thinking as I was typing it in,\n\n471\n00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.820\nI wonder if it shows up like with\na comma and right here at the end of it.\n\n472\n00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.380\nBut it doesn't look like it shows up yet,\nokay, or at all.\n\n473\n00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.770\nBut, inside of the PowerShell though,\n\n474\n00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:45.261\nI can always type in get- MailContact,\nAnd we'll do DanPArk.\n\n475\n00:27:47.068 --> 00:27:50.239\nThis time we're gonna pipe this in, and\n\n476\n00:27:50.239 --> 00:27:55.088\ntell it that we want to take\na look at its extended properties,\n\n477\n00:27:55.088 --> 00:28:00.898\nexpand property, EmailAddress,\n\n478\n00:28:00.898 --> 00:28:06.250\noops, it might be addresses,\nsorry, let me, there we go, okay.\n\n479\n00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.050\nAnd now,\n\n480\n00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:11.320\nthis is where you will end up seeing\nwhere notice it add in both of them.\n\n481\n00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.030\nRemember that the all caps is,\nof course, my primary address.\n\n482\n00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.000\nAnd then, this is the secondary one.\n\n483\n00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.975\nBut it doesn't seem to show\nup inside of the Web UI.\n\n484\n00:28:19.975 --> 00:28:23.230\nSo that's another reason that\nyou'll probably not see it there.\n\n485\n00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.520\nBut if you need to check,\nif your contact has a secondary address,\n\n486\n00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.540\nyou can always use this command.\n\n487\n00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:34.550\nIf you need to add in a secondary address,\nyou're instead gonna use the set\n\n488\n00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.960\nmail command, and\nbe able to type it in this way.\n\n489\n00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.615\nSo that will give us, just about\neverything that we need when we start\n\n490\n00:28:42.615 --> 00:28:46.573\nworking with contacts to get\nthem into our organization.\n\n491\n00:28:46.573 --> 00:28:49.937\nAnd, once we start doing that and\nfeeling confident about that,\n\n492\n00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:53.140\nwe're gonna see that there's\nstill a lot more to go.\n\n493\n00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:57.740\nBut Zach, I think I've talked long\nenough here that I've run out of time.\n\n494\n00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.560\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n495\n00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.590\nNow, there'll be more configure, contacts,\nresources part three, as we go on.\n\n496\n00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.952\nAnd, enabling Office 365 Services.\n\n497\n00:29:05.952 --> 00:29:09.100\nAnd you'll wanna stay tuned for\nevery single moment of that.\n\n498\n00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.420\nWell, again, thanks for watching ITProTV.\n\n499\n00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.143\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n500\n00:29:12.143 --> 00:29:13.140\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n501\n00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.697\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see\n\n502\n00:29:17.697 --> 00:29:22.638\nyou next time.\n\n503\n00:29:22.638 --> 00:29:26.021\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:12.270\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.220\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.940\nAs we enable Office 365 services,\n\n8\n00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.595\ncontinuing with part three of\nConfigure Contacts and Resources.\n\n9\n00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:29.865\nRonnie Wong is gonna lead us every step\nof the way, he is our IT professional.\n\n10\n00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:31.330\nRonnie, thanks for being here again.\n\n11\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.570\nWell, thank you again for\nhaving me back on this show,\n\n12\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.210\ntaking a look at it, part three.\n\n13\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.710\nWe're getting close to\na little mini-series here.\n\n14\n00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.230\nSo we should be on network TV at\nsome point, Don, of doing this.\n\n15\n00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.360\nBut overall, though, as we're taking a\nlook at part three, Zach is exactly right.\n\n16\n00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.930\nWe've been taking a lot of time taking\na look at configuring contacts, right,\n\n17\n00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.770\nand email addresses, and\nthat's a big part of it.\n\n18\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.910\nBut the other part,\nof course, are resources.\n\n19\n00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.400\nAnd at the very end of our last show,\n\n20\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.820\nwe did show you a little bit more\nabout setting up those resources.\n\n21\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.720\nMaking sure that the contacts can get\nadditional information into them.\n\n22\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.460\nAnd now we're moving on to one of\nthe big resources that we have,\n\n23\n00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.530\nis the idea of a distribution group.\n\n24\n00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.840\nInside of the world of Active Directory\nnetworks that are out there, and\n\n25\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.240\nsecurity boundaries.\n\n26\n00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.090\nWe think about two different grouping\ntypes, one is a security grouping.\n\n27\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.110\nBut the other one is as important, even\nthough we don't think about it that way\n\n28\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.020\na lot of times, is a distribution group.\n\n29\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.140\nNow, when it comes down to distribution\ngroups, you might be wondering,\n\n30\n00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.450\nwhy is this important?\n\n31\n00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.120\nIt allows me to be able to send one email,\nand\n\n32\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.320\nnow be able to hit everybody\nin that distribution group.\n\n33\n00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.021\nSo instead of me or Zack having to\ntype out 20 or 30 separate emails.\n\n34\n00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:46.132\nOr even one email, and\nthen pasting everybody's name into.\n\n35\n00:01:46.132 --> 00:01:49.174\nI add everybody into this\nlogical container that we called\n\n36\n00:01:49.174 --> 00:01:50.423\na distribution group.\n\n37\n00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:52.837\nAnd then I just send one\nemail to that group.\n\n38\n00:01:52.837 --> 00:01:54.448\nAnd then it automatically says,\n\n39\n00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:57.940\nokay, I'm gonna send it out to\neverybody within that group.\n\n40\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.130\nAnd now I've created an effective\ndistribution list, is what we've done.\n\n41\n00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.340\nSo we need to make sure\nthat we understand,\n\n42\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.310\nof course then, how to create\nthis type of distribution group.\n\n43\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.480\nAnd then some of the management\nfeatures that we'll have.\n\n44\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.680\nWe, of course,\nwill take a look at using the web UI,\n\n45\n00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.080\nthe web user interface,\nas well as the PowerShell.\n\n46\n00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.840\nWe're really only gonna focus in on\nthe PowerShell, on the creation part.\n\n47\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.680\nOn the management part,\n\n48\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.802\nwe're gonna go into the web UI, and you\nwill see why we're going to choose that.\n\n49\n00:02:27.802 --> 00:02:31.840\nBecause it really does give you a chance\nto make sure you understand all the little\n\n50\n00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.520\nsettings and configurations.\n\n51\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.150\nIn that distribution group,\nthat we need to understand.\n\n52\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.430\nSo that is gonna be key in\nwhat we're gonna do, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.223\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n54\n00:02:40.223 --> 00:02:43.234\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, as we take a look, then,\n\n55\n00:02:43.234 --> 00:02:46.930\nat creating this idea of\na distribution group.\n\n56\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.220\nThere's gonna be something that we\ndefinitely need to make sure of, okay?\n\n57\n00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.270\nRight at the beginning here,\nit kind of doesn't make sense,\n\n58\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.130\nif we don't know why we're\ncreating the distribution group.\n\n59\n00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.350\nMost organizations,\nwhen you begin to do this, you might go.\n\n60\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.500\nI don't know why I want to create\na distribution group, I just do.\n\n61\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.760\nSo usually, there's a logical reason for\nus to do so.\n\n62\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.740\nIt might be,\nwhere we've been assigned to a team.\n\n63\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.260\nAnd so, instead of the team\nleader having to email everybody.\n\n64\n00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.070\nThey go ahead and they just go,\nall right, here is your team.\n\n65\n00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.940\nLet's just create a distribution group,\nso that emails only go out to that team.\n\n66\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.500\nAnd that makes sense.\n\n67\n00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.405\nWell, in our organization, because we've\nended up with a boy band organization.\n\n68\n00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:28.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna create a different type of\n\n69\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.510\ndistribution group.\n\n70\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.790\nLet's say, for an example,\nwe're gonna create a distribution group.\n\n71\n00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.650\nThat is really going to help\nus to create a mail list for,\n\n72\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.750\nlet's say, that, right here.\n\n73\n00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.030\nAll of the major fan clubs of this\nboy band group in the United States.\n\n74\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.700\nSo we've asked for\nthem to send us their contact information.\n\n75\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.290\nAnd now we're gonna create a group,\nwe're gonna put them into it.\n\n76\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.320\nSo this way, if that band ever\ndecides to do a reunion tour.\n\n77\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.750\nAnd, they want to make sure that\ntheir fan clubs are out there.\n\n78\n00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.990\nThey do not have to spend time\nwriting each and every one of them.\n\n79\n00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.472\nThey can send it to a distribution list,\nand it will go forward from there.\n\n80\n00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:06.650\n&gt;&gt; One-stop job.\n\n81\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it makes sense for\nthem to do that.\n\n82\n00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.710\nSo, let's show us some of the things\nthat we can do to make that happen.\n\n83\n00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.650\nLet's take a look in the web UI first.\n\n84\n00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.180\nSo, I'm back at the Office\n365 admin center.\n\n85\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.230\nAnd I'm gonna click on the admin tile,\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n86\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.360\nAnd once I do,\nI'm gonna be looking inside,\n\n87\n00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.810\nof course, the Office 365 admin center.\n\n88\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.830\nAnd over on the left-hand side, we're\ngonna scroll down to the very bottom.\n\n89\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.770\nAnd we're gonna look for\nthis little tiny icon.\n\n90\n00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.040\nDown here with the letter A,\nwhich means admin centers.\n\n91\n00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.850\nThen, I'm gonna select\nthe Exchange Admin Center, or the EAC.\n\n92\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.990\nLet me zoom out, so\nwe can see everything as it comes back in.\n\n93\n00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.560\nOnce I'm here, by taking a look\nat the Exchange Admin Center,\n\n94\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.630\nI now want to create a new group.\n\n95\n00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.370\nWell the good thing is, the admin center\nreally is fairly intuitive in this way.\n\n96\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.000\nAnd they've set it up, that if I want\nto create a new distribution group.\n\n97\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.480\nNotice that underneath this grouping\nof recipients here, you see mailboxes,\n\n98\n00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.000\ngroups.\n\n99\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.610\nHey, that seems to indicate something.\n\n100\n00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.859\nSo I'm going to select Groups, and now\nthat I'm actually inside of the groups.\n\n101\n00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:19.175\nYou can see a couple of the different\ngroups that have actually\n\n102\n00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:20.846\nhave been created in the past.\n\n103\n00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:23.291\nDuring the recording of this entire show.\n\n104\n00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:27.706\nWe have course created the eDiscovery\nmanagers, to help us to do eDiscovery.\n\n105\n00:05:27.706 --> 00:05:31.275\nFor things like the legal holds\nthat may be on someone's email box,\n\n106\n00:05:31.275 --> 00:05:32.158\nif we wanted to.\n\n107\n00:05:32.158 --> 00:05:35.450\nWe also created a security\ngroup of groupies.\n\n108\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.760\nThis is a show I ended up doing with\nCherokee, where we created that as well.\n\n109\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.510\nAnd then we, of course, created a\ntechnical support team distribution group.\n\n110\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.345\nAnd we also, at some point in time, we\nhave created this distribution group for,\n\n111\n00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:51.330\nwell, the merchandisers, right?\n\n112\n00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.160\nThat come to the venues to be able to\nsell their wares out there, that we have.\n\n113\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.680\nAnd we of course, love for\nthem to be a part of the experience too.\n\n114\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.740\nSo now,\nwe have this distribution group here.\n\n115\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.220\nIf I want to create this, and\nwe're not gonna create this,\n\n116\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.250\nwe wanna at least show you.\n\n117\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.060\nIn the web UI interface,\nhow do you go about creating?\n\n118\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.260\nWe're gonna use a PowerShell to\ncreate this, well, it's simple.\n\n119\n00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.520\nWe just click on the plus sign, and\n\n120\n00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.420\nnow we have all these different\ngroups that are available to us.\n\n121\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.180\nWell, Zach I'm hoping that because\nwe're centered around creating\n\n122\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.290\na distribution group.\n\n123\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.324\nIt seems easy enough which\none we're gonna choose right?\n\n124\n00:06:27.324 --> 00:06:28.199\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, So-\n\n125\n00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:28.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:06:28.907 --> 00:06:29.970\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so we're\n\n127\n00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.360\ngonna select Distribution Group.\n\n128\n00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.100\nAnd it's in here, that we simply start\nfilling out, of course, the name.\n\n129\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.230\nAnd you just have to fill out\nthe ones that have the asterisk, but\n\n130\n00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.470\nthis one has asterisks everywhere.\n\n131\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.780\nSo you create a group name, and\nthen a group email address.\n\n132\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.380\nAnd you associate it with the domains\nthat you have associated with.\n\n133\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.480\nNow, we're not gonna do this.\n\n134\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.420\nBecause it's easy enough, for\nanybody to come in here and\n\n135\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.550\ngo, okay, I know I need a group name.\n\n136\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.360\nI know I'm gonna need email address,\nand, of course, a privacy level,\n\n137\n00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.450\nif you want to.\n\n138\n00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.790\nWho is going to own the group?\n\n139\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.220\nSo this can be anybody in\nyour organization, but\n\n140\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.920\nyou just simply select who it's gonna be,\nand what language.\n\n141\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.890\nYou can even add a description.\n\n142\n00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.660\nOf course, that would something\nthat you'd want to do,\n\n143\n00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.800\nif you have a lot of distribution groups.\n\n144\n00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.020\nSo that even somebody besides\nyourself would understand,\n\n145\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.150\nwhy this group was created, too.\n\n146\n00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.720\nAnd ability to subscribe new members,\nhere.\n\n147\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.360\nWe're gonna get into this,\nin the management side of things.\n\n148\n00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.950\nWe're not gonna take a look at\nit in the creation right now,\n\n149\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.160\nbecause this is easy\nenough in the creation.\n\n150\n00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.340\nOnce we get this, we just click the Save,\nwhich is right beside my head right there.\n\n151\n00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.630\nAnd once that's done, it will begin\nto create that group for us, okay?\n\n152\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.690\nSo it's not really\ndifficult in the Web UI.\n\n153\n00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.780\nIt seems logical, easy enough for\nus to create a group.\n\n154\n00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.950\nAt that point, once we're done with that,\nwe need to add members in that group.\n\n155\n00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.260\nAnd we'll see that's easy enough to do.\n\n156\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.878\nYou go through, and\nyou just add in email addresses.\n\n157\n00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:56.283\nAnd you're just about ready to go, okay?\n\n158\n00:07:56.283 --> 00:08:00.372\nSo once we have that established and\ndown, and understanding that,\n\n159\n00:08:00.372 --> 00:08:01.857\nNot exactly difficult.\n\n160\n00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:06.570\nBut on the exam, though,\nwhat they ask you to call out, of course,\n\n161\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.360\nis not just well, in the web UI itself.\n\n162\n00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.363\nIt's always in this,\ntoo, in the PowerShell.\n\n163\n00:08:12.363 --> 00:08:18.010\nAnd that is because everybody gets to\nthat distribution group a different way.\n\n164\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.370\nThey come at it in a different avenue,\nand it can be created differently.\n\n165\n00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.320\nBut here, you gotta know the syntax.\n\n166\n00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.850\nAnd on the exam,\njudging the syntax is easier,\n\n167\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:33.170\nbecause there's only one right syntax,\nessentially, as you do this.\n\n168\n00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.190\nSo let's make sure here.\n\n169\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.480\nSo I'm gonna do get ps session,\njust in case the session broke.\n\n170\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.810\nLet’s see here.\n\n171\n00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.683\nNow notice, look at that.\n\n172\n00:08:42.683 --> 00:08:46.140\nIt actually ended up opening\nanother session for me, too.\n\n173\n00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.090\nSo you start seeing there is\nanother one that’s now open.\n\n174\n00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.570\nAnd that’s because I did not clear\nout of the last session I was in.\n\n175\n00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.450\nSo that’s why you’re actually starting\nto see some other sessions here.\n\n176\n00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.019\nNow once I’m here,\nwe’re gonna create a distribution group.\n\n177\n00:08:58.019 --> 00:08:59.787\nSo let’s go ahead and do this for\n\n178\n00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:03.533\nthe fan club that we were talking\nabout that will help us out, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:03.533 --> 00:09:08.560\nSo inside the PowerShell, we are gonna\ncreate a new distribution group.\n\n180\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.130\nNow if you're wondering, Zach, cuz I'm\nnot sure if you've seen this before.\n\n181\n00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.658\nI typed it in relatively quickly there,\nright?\n\n182\n00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:14.191\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n183\n00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:15.178\n&gt;&gt; It was insanely fast.\n\n184\n00:09:15.178 --> 00:09:16.618\n&gt;&gt; It kind of did it by itself.\n\n185\n00:09:16.618 --> 00:09:20.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's amazing, and\nthat's because it actually has a tab fill.\n\n186\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.318\nOnce it gets enough, right,\nwhere it becomes unambiguous,\n\n187\n00:09:24.318 --> 00:09:27.980\nit knows if I hit the Tab key,\nit will fill out the rest of it for me.\n\n188\n00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.510\nBut you do have to be careful because\nsometimes there can be a little bit\n\n189\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.620\nmore here.\n\n190\n00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.490\nSo make sure you read and understand which\none you're doing, or the tab fill can also\n\n191\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.026\nbe your worst enemy by thinking, yeah, of\ncourse, it's gonna do exactly what I want.\n\n192\n00:09:42.026 --> 00:09:45.540\nNot every time, and so\nwhen we start doing this,\n\n193\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.680\nmake sure you pay\nattention as you hit that.\n\n194\n00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.610\nWe're going to give this a name for\nthis particular group as well.\n\n195\n00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.630\nAnd if I add in spaces,\nI'm gonna include in quotation marks here.\n\n196\n00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:03.617\nSo we're gonna say that this is gonna our,\nlet's just call it FanClub.\n\n197\n00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:11.200\nI'm gonna do this as one word, FanClub US.\n\n198\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.270\nNow you might say,\nwhy don't you just call it, US FanClub?\n\n199\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.340\nBecause what if there's a worldwide,\nthere's multiple fan clubs everywhere.\n\n200\n00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.319\nI wanna start off in the address list and\nthat distribution group and\n\n201\n00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:21.320\nmake sure it shows up.\n\n202\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.489\nFanClub US, Canada, as it goes around.\n\n203\n00:10:25.489 --> 00:10:27.900\nSo that way I know that\nit's gonna be that way.\n\n204\n00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.104\nYou do have to think about these things.\n\n205\n00:10:29.104 --> 00:10:34.342\nIt doesn't matter if it's all over your\naddress book or not, but for ease and\n\n206\n00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:39.902\nfor sake of management, right, if there's\na UK fan club and all that and you say,\n\n207\n00:10:39.902 --> 00:10:45.080\nUK, US right, Canada, and\nyou have to keep searching back and forth.\n\n208\n00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.538\nBy putting it this way, FanClub US,\nFanClub UK, FanClub Canada,\n\n209\n00:10:49.538 --> 00:10:54.011\nSouth America next, it keeps it\nall together, at least in my mind.\n\n210\n00:10:54.011 --> 00:10:56.690\nThat's what I think of\nwhen I start seeing this.\n\n211\n00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.010\nThe other thing, of course,\nis how this will be displayed.\n\n212\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.683\nI wanna add that in.\n\n213\n00:11:00.683 --> 00:11:04.146\nAnd this time, again,\n\n214\n00:11:04.146 --> 00:11:10.039\nI'm gonna call it FanClub US Mail List.\n\n215\n00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:17.940\nSo internally, when I go and look for\nit, it should just say, mail list.\n\n216\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.320\nThat way, it allows somebody else to\nknow that this is a distribution group.\n\n217\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.680\nWe're not using it for\nany security purposes.\n\n218\n00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.710\nIt's all about saying,\nif I'm gonna use this,\n\n219\n00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.500\nI'm gonna be sending email out to people,\nis what this one's gonna be about.\n\n220\n00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.120\nSo they're not gonna use this accidentally\nsomewhere else within our organization.\n\n221\n00:11:35.147 --> 00:11:37.500\nWe are going to create an alias as well.\n\n222\n00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:46.717\nOn this one, I'm gonna do FanClubUS,\nall as one word.\n\n223\n00:11:46.717 --> 00:11:49.780\nThen we're gonna set up a primary address.\n\n224\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.240\nLet's see if I can see that.\n\n225\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.354\nThe primary SMTP address,\nwhich is an email address.\n\n226\n00:11:59.977 --> 00:12:04.516\nFrom here we’ll call it,\nThis one we'll say US fans.\n\n227\n00:12:07.697 --> 00:12:13.026\n@, and I’m going to do itprotvdemo.net.\n\n228\n00:12:15.917 --> 00:12:18.622\nAnd then we choose who's\ngonna manage this.\n\n229\n00:12:18.622 --> 00:12:25.090\nManaged by, and\nwe'll assign this one to Lance, all right?\n\n230\n00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.730\nSo we're creating a new\ndistribution group.\n\n231\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.741\nI've selected FanClub, I've tied in that,\n\n232\n00:12:30.741 --> 00:12:35.748\nas far as the way it's going to be\ndisplayed, gave it a new e-mail address.\n\n233\n00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:39.022\nItprotvdemo.net is another domain that's\n\n234\n00:12:39.022 --> 00:12:43.960\nactually managed by my Office\n365 organization as well.\n\n235\n00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.130\nSo it gives me that\nability to choose that.\n\n236\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.220\nNow if you do not have another domain,\nyou can't use it.\n\n237\n00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.290\nIt'll tell you, yeah, you're not,\nyou can't configure this for\n\n238\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.080\nanother domain that you don't own.\n\n239\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.375\nSo this one is actually owned by us here.\n\n240\n00:12:57.375 --> 00:13:01.670\nAnd so I assigned it into\nmy Office 365 organization.\n\n241\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.530\nOnce I press Enter, there we go.\n\n242\n00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.858\nIt has actually created the FanClub, and\n\n243\n00:13:06.858 --> 00:13:10.970\nwhat it's gonna be displayed as,\nFanClub US Mail List.\n\n244\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:16.770\nIt's a universal type here,\nUS Fans ITProTV demo.\n\n245\n00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.365\nMake sure I got everything else in\nthere correctly the way that I want to.\n\n246\n00:13:20.365 --> 00:13:22.978\nAnd that is pretty much just about it.\n\n247\n00:13:22.978 --> 00:13:28.296\nSo that now creates that\nFanClub inside of Office 365.\n\n248\n00:13:28.296 --> 00:13:30.590\nLet me go back to Groups.\n\n249\n00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.110\nHere's what we had originally\nshown you when we first started.\n\n250\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:39.070\nIf I refresh the screen,\nyou should now see there it is.\n\n251\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.153\nThe fan club that we created and\n\n252\n00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:44.527\nthe distribution group\nright here is what we see.\n\n253\n00:13:44.527 --> 00:13:49.850\nSo if I send out an email,\nokay, well, there it is.\n\n254\n00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.550\nIt's gonna actually return and\n\n255\n00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.090\nthat's the address that you'll see\nit'll be sent from, it's right here.\n\n256\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.080\nSo all those FanClubs in the United States\nwhen they actually see that\n\n257\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.420\nit's gonna be right here.\n\n258\n00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.210\nAnd the address that it comes back\nto is what they'll end up seeing.\n\n259\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:09.270\nIf I double-click on this, I can now see,\nof course, a lot of information.\n\n260\n00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.680\nThis is where it goes into\nthe management of some of the things.\n\n261\n00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.710\nThe ownership, we can add in,\nof course, additional owners.\n\n262\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.930\nI'm gonna skip membership for a moment.\n\n263\n00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.060\nThe approval of the membership.\n\n264\n00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.636\nSo if people are joining this\nparticular club here, I can\n\n265\n00:14:23.636 --> 00:14:28.571\nhave it where anyone can join this without\nbeing approved by the group owners.\n\n266\n00:14:28.571 --> 00:14:31.870\nThat can be good, it can be dangerous.\n\n267\n00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.389\nYou have to actually\ndecide that on your own.\n\n268\n00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:37.428\nWhether it's closed,\nthat's probably a lot easier for control.\n\n269\n00:14:37.428 --> 00:14:41.570\nThe owner approval, all requests are\napproved or rejected by the group owner.\n\n270\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.710\nChoose whether this\ngroup is open to leave.\n\n271\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.092\nIn other words, once they actually sign\nin, do you want to allow them to be able\n\n272\n00:14:47.092 --> 00:14:50.100\nto leave without being approved,\nor do you wanna close this off?\n\n273\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.260\nSo all that's also important to you.\n\n274\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.510\nDelivery management, centers inside of my\norganization, centers inside and outside.\n\n275\n00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.110\nDo the messages need to be\napproved before they go out?\n\n276\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:05.250\nSo notice that there is a ton of\ndifferent ways that you can actually take\n\n277\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.670\na look at some of the things\nthat you're doing.\n\n278\n00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.180\nBut what we're missing right now, though,\n\n279\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.980\nis who's gonna be a part of this\nparticular group, is what we're missing.\n\n280\n00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.790\nSo this is where we do need to add\nin some additional information.\n\n281\n00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.390\nNow normally this, of course,\ngoes on within an organization here.\n\n282\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.060\nSo what we're actually going to do\nis we're gonna add in, let's say,\n\n283\n00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.450\nthe owner of that group,\n\n284\n00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:35.990\nwhich we said was Lance, as being part\nof this distribution group as well.\n\n285\n00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.990\nSo the way that we do that is we\ndo ADD-DistributionGroupMember.\n\n286\n00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.690\nSo notice that this time it is different.\n\n287\n00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.043\nMake sure you pay attention to\nwhat you see before the dash.\n\n288\n00:15:47.043 --> 00:15:50.568\nOne is New-DistributionGroup, okay,\n\n289\n00:15:50.568 --> 00:15:55.209\nand the other one is\nAdd-DistributionGroupMember.\n\n290\n00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:58.300\nIf all of a sudden you are typing,\nlet's say,\n\n291\n00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.786\nas you are doing this And\nall of a sudden you go, hey,\n\n292\n00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:06.270\nI don't find DistributionGroupMember,\ncheck this part out.\n\n293\n00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.825\nI can't tell you how many times\nI've kept trying to type in\n\n294\n00:16:09.825 --> 00:16:14.390\nNew-DistributionGroupMember, and\nsaying, why is that not working?\n\n295\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.460\nIt is because it is with this\nprefix instead, that does that.\n\n296\n00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.860\nSo don't assume that something is wrong.\n\n297\n00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.980\nAssume that, hey, maybe you made\na typo here as you start to do this.\n\n298\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.750\nCuz I know that I've done it too, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:34.288\nThen we are going to do the identity.\n\n300\n00:16:34.288 --> 00:16:37.098\nAnd let's say that this\none is going to be, and\n\n301\n00:16:37.098 --> 00:16:40.428\nI can choose any of these\nnames up here that I've used.\n\n302\n00:16:40.428 --> 00:16:43.980\nThe alias, or the display name,\nor the name itself.\n\n303\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:52.390\nSo I can do fan, club, oops,\nif I can spell it, US, like this.\n\n304\n00:16:54.820 --> 00:17:01.424\nNow I do a -member, and this time\nwe are gonna add in the member of\n\n305\n00:17:01.424 --> 00:17:11.424\nlance@officeprodemocoonmicrosoft.com.\n\n306\n00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.661\nNow, there could be a couple of\nthings that may happen here.\n\n307\n00:17:18.661 --> 00:17:21.467\nI always like to try this cuz\nI don't ever remember, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:21.467 --> 00:17:25.991\nIn my notes, I have it where the member,\nthe email address here is in parentheses,\n\n309\n00:17:25.991 --> 00:17:28.528\nbut let me see if I get\ncould get red by doing it.\n\n310\n00:17:28.528 --> 00:17:32.650\nSometimes I do, sometimes I don't, so\nlet's see what happens here as I do this.\n\n311\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.568\nNow notice that this one, even though I\nhave parentheses around my notes here,\n\n312\n00:17:36.568 --> 00:17:38.390\nit was allowing me to do without it.\n\n313\n00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.740\nSometimes you might end up seeing where\nit says I don't recognize the member,\n\n314\n00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.900\ntry quotes around it.\n\n315\n00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.450\nAnd I don't know why in\nsome of the different ones,\n\n316\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.610\nit require some of them that doesn't\nlook like it requires that at all.\n\n317\n00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:57.278\nSo here's the ability to add\nin a member into this one.\n\n318\n00:17:57.278 --> 00:18:01.180\nSo let me go back and\nlet's refresh this page.\n\n319\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.878\nSo I'm gonna refresh the entire group and\nOutlook there.\n\n320\n00:18:04.878 --> 00:18:07.490\nSelect the US Mail Fan Club here.\n\n321\n00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.340\nGo down to membership.\n\n322\n00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.300\nAnd now notice,\nwe added Lance directly in here, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.830\nIt gives us that ability to be\nable to do that very quickly.\n\n324\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.320\nSo it is good that we can do that, okay?\n\n325\n00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.320\nJust as easily,\n\n326\n00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.660\nwe of course can also remove a member\nif we choose to manually as well.\n\n327\n00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.050\nNow, this is also something else\nthat is called out on the exam, too.\n\n328\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.380\nSo, we wanna make sure that\nyou understand how to do that.\n\n329\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:41.400\nNow, this one's not as tricky, but\nit does require you to know the syntax.\n\n330\n00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.621\nNow, notice here,\nthis is what I was talking about.\n\n331\n00:18:44.621 --> 00:18:49.240\nRemove-DistributionGroup, that's\na lot different than removing\n\n332\n00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.430\nLance from this distribution.\n\n333\n00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.210\nThis is gonna say, hey,\nremove that distribution group itself.\n\n334\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.190\nIf I hit my tab fill,\n\n335\n00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:02.350\nnotice that that automatically our tab\ncompletion, that's gonna add it in.\n\n336\n00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:07.320\nSo even up to this point, when I first did\nit right up to here, that gives me that.\n\n337\n00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.570\nIf I'm working very quickly,\nor my eyes are scanning for\n\n338\n00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.770\nwhat the proper syntax is gonna be,\nthis is not the proper syntax.\n\n339\n00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.890\nIf I need to remove\na member from that group,\n\n340\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.050\nI need to make sure that I\ntake a look at this one.\n\n341\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.163\nAnd it's here again that,\noops, I do a dash,\n\n342\n00:19:26.163 --> 00:19:31.031\nidentity, so this should now be just\nabout identical to what we see above.\n\n343\n00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.182\nAnd then from here,\n\n344\n00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:49.109\nOops, let me zoom out so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n345\n00:19:49.109 --> 00:19:59.487\nOfficeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n346\n00:19:59.487 --> 00:20:02.250\nSo as long as I didn't misspell it,\nI'm okay.\n\n347\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:08.400\nFor me, a lot of times the typo\nis kinda the key for what I do.\n\n348\n00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.570\nBy default, if you just press Enter\nautomatically without thinking about it,\n\n349\n00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.820\nit is yes, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.760\nSo it's saying, hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n351\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.360\nAnd now we allow for it to happen.\n\n352\n00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.825\nNow we should be able to go back and\ncheck I close this out,\n\n353\n00:20:25.825 --> 00:20:29.921\nand go back in as well, so let's refresh.\n\n354\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.399\nMake sure it updated up online,\n\n355\n00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:39.629\non the Microsoft Office 365 Cloud.\n\n356\n00:20:39.629 --> 00:20:42.658\nSelect Membership, and now there it is.\n\n357\n00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:45.059\nMy membership has now been revoked or\n\n358\n00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:49.560\nLance's membership has now\nbeen removed from what we see.\n\n359\n00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.920\nSo it is very important that we\nunderstand at least that part of it.\n\n360\n00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.990\nMake sure you come back through and\ntake a look at some of the things that we\n\n361\n00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.100\npointed out in terms of\nthe management here, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.930\nYou wanna change the owner,\nyou can change the owner of that group.\n\n363\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.460\nYou wanna select membership approval,\nyou can do that, as well here,\n\n364\n00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.220\nas well as delivery management,\nmessage approvals, email options.\n\n365\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.300\nYou name it.\n\n366\n00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.210\nGroup delegation,\n\n367\n00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.120\nwhich we're about to talk about the idea\nof delegation here in a moment.\n\n368\n00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.450\nBut overall, though, just kinda realize\nthat there are a lot of options.\n\n369\n00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.860\nIt's not just about creating a group and\ngoing, okay, here it is.\n\n370\n00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.820\nYou do have to understand both and\n\n371\n00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.251\nmake sure you do take a look at\nit in the PowerShell as well.\n\n372\n00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:31.727\nThis is where, because we did show\nyou like that idea of delegation,\n\n373\n00:21:31.727 --> 00:21:35.831\nwe need to talk about this idea\nof delegation just briefly too.\n\n374\n00:21:35.831 --> 00:21:43.000\nWhen it comes down to delegation, and we\nactually have a perfect example of this.\n\n375\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.300\nOne of these members, and\nyou were just telling me this,\n\n376\n00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.120\none of these members actually\ntheir fame has continued to rise.\n\n377\n00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.447\nThe other one, I'm not saying\nthat they're not famous, but\n\n378\n00:21:51.447 --> 00:21:52.487\nnot as much as this one guy.\n\n379\n00:21:52.487 --> 00:21:53.952\nWho's that?\n\n380\n00:21:53.952 --> 00:21:55.437\n&gt;&gt; B-listers, Justin Timberlake.\n\n381\n00:21:55.437 --> 00:21:55.969\n&gt;&gt; Justin Timberlake.\n\n382\n00:21:55.969 --> 00:21:56.732\n&gt;&gt; Of course, my gosh.\n\n383\n00:21:56.732 --> 00:22:00.139\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Justin Timberlake, right,\nhis star has continued to rise.\n\n384\n00:22:00.139 --> 00:22:03.317\nWhat are the chances that you think\nthat he answers his own emails?\n\n385\n00:22:03.317 --> 00:22:06.284\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't say that he\nwould answer his own emails.\n\n386\n00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:07.322\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, there's no way.\n\n387\n00:22:07.322 --> 00:22:11.475\nHe probably has,\nlet's say 10,000 a day, okay?\n\n388\n00:22:11.475 --> 00:22:14.672\nEven if he wanted to,\nit's an impossibility for him-\n\n389\n00:22:14.672 --> 00:22:15.605\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Delegate it to some people.\n\n390\n00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:18.096\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nyou have to delegate it some people.\n\n391\n00:22:18.096 --> 00:22:18.975\nThat's the same thing.\n\n392\n00:22:18.975 --> 00:22:20.075\nIn Office 365,\n\n393\n00:22:20.075 --> 00:22:24.420\nwe can also use that idea of delegation\nto make something like that happen.\n\n394\n00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.518\nSo why don't we do that?\n\n395\n00:22:25.518 --> 00:22:28.210\nWhy don't we help Justin out here\nif he's gonna beat this, okay?\n\n396\n00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:33.743\nSo let's go ahead and take a look here,\nokay, so here it is we're in Office 365.\n\n397\n00:22:33.743 --> 00:22:38.575\nNow delegation is relatively simple when\nwhat we're going to do which is we click\n\n398\n00:22:38.575 --> 00:22:40.330\non mailboxes.\n\n399\n00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.197\nAnd then we can select Justin Timberlake.\n\n400\n00:22:43.197 --> 00:22:47.570\nWhen I double-click on his name,\nhere it is.\n\n401\n00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:51.662\nIn this list of management for\nJustin Timberlake, you can guess.\n\n402\n00:22:51.662 --> 00:22:55.230\nMailbox delegation, sounds like the idea.\n\n403\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.124\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like it.\n\n404\n00:22:56.124 --> 00:23:00.020\n&gt;&gt; So, here we do have this ability.\n\n405\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.416\nIf we didn't want to bother Justin with\nhim having to set up his own email\n\n406\n00:23:05.416 --> 00:23:10.830\ndelegation, we can actually assign\nsomebody to send as him, okay?\n\n407\n00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:15.250\nAllows a delegate to send email\nfrom this mailbox, instead.\n\n408\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.900\nThe message will appear to have\nbeen sent by the mailbox owner.\n\n409\n00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.090\nThat's very nice.\n\n410\n00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.340\nSo, you can actually see that, okay?\n\n411\n00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.260\nSend on behalf of permission\nallows the delegate\n\n412\n00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.360\nto send email on behalf of this mailbox.\n\n413\n00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.460\nThe from line in any message will be\nsent by the delegate, in the case that\n\n414\n00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.100\nthe message was sent by the delegate\non behalf of that mailbox owner.\n\n415\n00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.320\nAnd then, of course, there's Full Access,\n\n416\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.210\nessentially somebody taking over\nthe mailbox, okay, is what we also see.\n\n417\n00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:48.459\nSo, you can have any of those options\nthat you choose to right there,\n\n418\n00:23:48.459 --> 00:23:51.549\navailable for you, off and ready to go.\n\n419\n00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:57.874\nBut, okay, the other part of it\nthough is if Justin, himself.\n\n420\n00:23:57.874 --> 00:24:01.055\nWere actually going to set this\nup themselves, he could do it.\n\n421\n00:24:01.055 --> 00:24:04.808\nNow, I don't actually have access\nto Justin's email account yet\n\n422\n00:24:04.808 --> 00:24:08.450\nbecause he just been recently\nadded to our email list here.\n\n423\n00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.040\nSo his account is being credited.\n\n424\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.000\nI do have access to Joey's account though,\nokay?\n\n425\n00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.600\nSo let me show you from Joey's account.\n\n426\n00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.560\nEven though, I'm not gonna say\nJoey doesn't need delegation,\n\n427\n00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.330\nhe probably does, but let's say this one.\n\n428\n00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:26.210\nIf he can open up from his\nmachine his own Outlook,\n\n429\n00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.820\nhis email client,\nwhere he can read all of his emails.\n\n430\n00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.960\nWell, he can do it from right here too.\n\n431\n00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.936\nIf it were Joey trying to set it up\non his own he'd simply click on file.\n\n432\n00:24:37.936 --> 00:24:39.952\nAnd once he clicks on file,\n\n433\n00:24:39.952 --> 00:24:44.940\nthis is where he can go to\nwhere it says account settings.\n\n434\n00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.230\nAnd now notice right here,\n\n435\n00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:50.880\nZach, he can delegate his own\npermissions if he chooses to.\n\n436\n00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.530\nSo he has that option, so\n\n437\n00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:56.020\nJustin has an option if you wanted\nto from this point, to do that.\n\n438\n00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.140\nAnd actually assign who\ndelegate is gonna be and\n\n439\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.390\nthat's the way that\nindividuals can also do this.\n\n440\n00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.750\nMost of the time in an organization,\nmost people are never,\n\n441\n00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.790\nthey're like who would I delegate this to?\n\n442\n00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.560\nSo more than likely\nthe manager would actually say\n\n443\n00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.610\nwho they're actually gonna end up\ndelegating this stuff to instead.\n\n444\n00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:18.250\nSo even though that's something you can\ndo on your own and some people can do.\n\n445\n00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.770\nIf you though want to be able to do that,\n\n446\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.770\nthat is what you have to kind\nof take a look at, all right?\n\n447\n00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.770\nSo, when we start to take a look that,\nwhat are some\n\n448\n00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.590\nof the things that we can do inside\nof PowerShell to really help us out?\n\n449\n00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.390\nWe're only gonna do a few of these.\n\n450\n00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.430\nThere are many different\nones that we can do here.\n\n451\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.860\nBut let's just kinda do,\nkind of the big ones here.\n\n452\n00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.180\nLet's say that, at this point, right?\n\n453\n00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:46.480\nAnd we'll use Joey as an example cuz I\nknow his account is fully set up here.\n\n454\n00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.260\nThat we are going to\nessentially give Lance, okay,\n\n455\n00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.560\nfull access,\nfull control over Joey's mailbox.\n\n456\n00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.770\n&gt;&gt; Is that wise?\n\n457\n00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:56.798\n&gt;&gt; It may not be wise.\n\n458\n00:25:56.798 --> 00:26:00.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is something we're gonna do.\n\n459\n00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n460\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.090\nit depends on if there's any rivalry\nrivalry that's going on there,\n\n461\n00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.040\nthen we'd kind of make that\na little bit more different.\n\n462\n00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.590\nSo the way that we do that is\nthat now that everything is good.\n\n463\n00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.610\nLet's see here, we should still\nbe connected from previously\n\n464\n00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.660\nI need to go in and\nadd mailbox permissions.\n\n465\n00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.250\nNow you’ll notice the first\none that popped up\n\n466\n00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.320\nwas mailbox folder permissions task.\n\n467\n00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.500\nThat’s not the same here, okay?\n\n468\n00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:34.133\nSo, we need to go ahead and use that tab\nand get to mailbox permissions for Joey.\n\n469\n00:26:34.133 --> 00:26:39.810\nAnd then the user that we are delegating\nthis to is gonna be Lance.\n\n470\n00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:43.950\nThen we're going to say what access\nrights we are giving Lance, and\n\n471\n00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.160\nthis time we're gonna do full access.\n\n472\n00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:56.506\nWe're also gonna assign and inheritance\nif I can spell inheritance type.\n\n473\n00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:02.770\nAnd this time we're gonna actually say\nwith full access, everything okay?\n\n474\n00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:07.960\nWe could limit this to his outbox or\nto something like that if we wanted to.\n\n475\n00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.940\nBut, we're just going to\ngive him full access.\n\n476\n00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.330\nAnd this lets us know.\n\n477\n00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:17.960\nYou can see where his identity now,\nis now gonna be managed by Lance, and\n\n478\n00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.600\nhe's been given full access rights.\n\n479\n00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.060\nSo, that gives him that ability\nto do that, which is great,\n\n480\n00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:30.130\nbecause now it means Joey doesn't have to\neven worry about checking email anymore.\n\n481\n00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:35.410\nLance is essentially doing everything for\nhim, and that is what else we can do.\n\n482\n00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.960\nIf you want to also be able\nto see just by chance.\n\n483\n00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.650\nSomebody says, hey look,\n\n484\n00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:45.270\nI don't know who has permission\non a particular email box here.\n\n485\n00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:52.995\nI can also do a get dash\nmail box permission here and\n\n486\n00:27:52.995 --> 00:27:57.869\nthen select who we're looking for.\n\n487\n00:27:57.869 --> 00:28:03.410\nNow, you can see all of the different\npermissions that are available right here.\n\n488\n00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:07.460\nAnd to whom,\nthey're also delegated too as well.\n\n489\n00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.580\nSo all of these have different access\nrights into Joey's mailbox as well.\n\n490\n00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.290\nNow at the end of the process,\nright, besides everything else\n\n491\n00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:19.730\nwhat if we realized, this is not\na good idea, like what Zack said.\n\n492\n00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.270\nIt's not good,\nthere's some in-house rivalry there and\n\n493\n00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.440\nthey don't like whatever's going on.\n\n494\n00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:33.110\nSo we figured that this is not a good idea\nbut we can remove the mailbox permission.\n\n495\n00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.850\nTo Joey's mailbox.\n\n496\n00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.534\nFrom Lance.\n\n497\n00:28:44.425 --> 00:28:49.320\nWe can assign rights here.\n\n498\n00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.859\nHis rights are full access.\n\n499\n00:28:57.428 --> 00:28:59.800\nAnd now, I must have misspelled something.\n\n500\n00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.706\nAccessRights, not AssignRights, see?\n\n501\n00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:04.720\nI tell you, when I can't read my\nown notes that's what happens.\n\n502\n00:29:05.845 --> 00:29:10.953\nI don't know how to spell\n\n503\n00:29:10.953 --> 00:29:15.730\naccess [LAUGH] ACC.\n\n504\n00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:20.320\nACC spelled ASS I wonder who,\nno that was me, okay, so\n\n505\n00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.515\nthis time it should work, there we go.\n\n506\n00:29:21.515 --> 00:29:26.107\n[LAUGH] I told you if anything\nwill fail me that is my typing,\n\n507\n00:29:26.107 --> 00:29:30.536\nmy typing will absolutely fail\nme this time there it is.\n\n508\n00:29:30.536 --> 00:29:34.710\nWe now have all these different\nthings that can be done.\n\n509\n00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.140\nBut just realize,\nyou don't always have to give full access.\n\n510\n00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.360\nWe could have instead replaced that full\naccess word that you see here along any of\n\n511\n00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:49.290\nthis, right, with the send on behalf of,\nor grant send on behalf of, or send as.\n\n512\n00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:53.110\nIf you do that, that again gives\nyou that ability to check that out.\n\n513\n00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:58.590\nMost of us are probably not gonna try and\nmanage permissions from the command line.\n\n514\n00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.450\nI'm not saying you can't, okay?\n\n515\n00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.190\nCuz obviously, you can.\n\n516\n00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:06.750\nBut I think in terms of management if you\nwere to do anything, it would be right\n\n517\n00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:11.920\nhere that you would choose to do that as\nin here, as what you would choose to do.\n\n518\n00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.100\nSo being able to create it,\nbeing able to assign those permissions,\n\n519\n00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.690\nfairly easy to do regardless\nof which way you do this.\n\n520\n00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:23.640\nBut it is a part of the skill set that\nyou definitely are gonna need to have\n\n521\n00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.520\nwhen you getting ready for this exam.\n\n522\n00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:30.220\nSo make sure you take time to practice\nthis as you continue to prepare.\n\n523\n00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.800\nAnd you also see,\nit's gonna be very helpful in the future,\n\n524\n00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.660\nas you start managing more of your\nOffice 365 email resources too.\n\n525\n00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.380\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Ronnie.\n\n526\n00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:42.150\nI think we have a pretty good idea how\nto configure contacts and resources now.\n\n527\n00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:43.630\nWithout part one, two and three.\n\n528\n00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:48.420\nMake sure if you miss one,\ngo back and catch one, two, and three\n\n529\n00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:53.170\nas we configure contracts and resources\ninside of enabling Office 365 Services.\n\n530\n00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.855\nI am Zach Memos, thank you for\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n531\n00:30:55.855 --> 00:30:57.260\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n532\n00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.700\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n533\n00:30:58.700 -->

00:00:12.064\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:16.200\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for making the intelligent\nchoice to watch ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.000\nI'm Zach Memos, I'm your host.\n\n6\n00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.870\nAs we are enabling Office 365 services.\n\n7\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.110\nAnd today, we're going to configure\npersonal archive policies\n\n8\n00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.960\nwith IT professional, Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.480\nRonnie, good to see you again, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you again for\n\n11\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.100\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue our journey through Office 365.\n\n12\n00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.771\n&gt;&gt; We need you, we need you,\nhelp us, guide us.\n\n13\n00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:39.764\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, we definitely need to\ntake a look here at the idea of what\n\n14\n00:00:39.764 --> 00:00:44.800\nyou're talking about, personal archive\npolicies that we have in place.\n\n15\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.460\nThe idea of archiving\nreally does help out email\n\n16\n00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.360\nmailboxes that we have and\nthat's because email boxes grow insanely.\n\n17\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360\nAs an organization gets busier the emails,\n\n18\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.040\nthe number of emails that come in,\nthey get really big.\n\n19\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.830\nAnd the problem is you never know if you\nreally need to refer back to that email.\n\n20\n00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.980\nSo at some point in time your email\nbox gets so gigantic and so huge, and\n\n21\n00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.460\nthere's so much in it from years past that\nit's very difficult to actually search for\n\n22\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.540\nanything easily at all.\n\n23\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.342\nAnd this is why we need to talk\nabout using archive polices\n\n24\n00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:23.855\nthat gives essentially a user a mailbox.\n\n25\n00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:28.857\nThat says look, we're going to store kind\nof the older information to allow you\n\n26\n00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:34.170\nto kinda search for more relevant emails\nin your time where you are, right?\n\n27\n00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.920\nSo it gives the user that ability\nto not have to worry about,\n\n28\n00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.310\ndid I lose that email?\n\n29\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.290\nI know it's gonna be stored somewhere\nthat's gonna be archived somewhere\n\n30\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.800\nin the future for us as far as older\nemail that now becomes historical data.\n\n31\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.176\nAnd that's actually gonna\nbe key in what we wanna do.\n\n32\n00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:53.841\n&gt;&gt; Well, if everything is in\nthe Office 365 Cloud, how do we or\n\n33\n00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:59.940\nwhy do we need to think about archiving\nour mailboxes, it doesn't make sense.\n\n34\n00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really doesnt, right?\n\n35\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.992\nThe very fact as we think about it, and\n\n36\n00:02:03.992 --> 00:02:08.383\nI understand cuz I thought kinda\nthe same way several years ago.\n\n37\n00:02:08.383 --> 00:02:13.742\nIf everything I'm doing is now in\nthe cloud and it's replicated in multiple\n\n38\n00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:19.020\nplaces, that my email box,\nmy mailbox for my email it's not there.\n\n39\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.040\nWhy do I even need to\nthink about archiving?\n\n40\n00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.190\nCuz it's in so many different places.\n\n41\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.354\nIf I lose something,\nI know that there's a possibility-\n\n42\n00:02:24.354 --> 00:02:25.353\n&gt;&gt; Hey, go grab it in the cloud.\n\n43\n00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:26.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna be there.\n\n44\n00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:29.700\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well, there are other reasons for\n\n45\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.820\nus actually having the archival purposes\n\n46\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.040\nthat we wanna think about one I mentioned,\nright?\n\n47\n00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.070\nThe ability to have what we call\nan in place hold as well, or\n\n48\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.120\na legal hold that we might have to have.\n\n49\n00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.480\nIf somebody comes in and\nsays Ronnie I'm suing you,\n\n50\n00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.900\nI need every single email from your\norganisation that mentions my name.\n\n51\n00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.380\nWell, now that becomes a little bit more\nwhere we might have to be to have some\n\n52\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.170\narchive information where we can\ngo back through and searched out.\n\n53\n00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.550\nWithout really interrupting the work and\n\n54\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.890\nprocess that's going on inside\nof my entire organization.\n\n55\n00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.770\nAnd there are emails from five,\nsix, years ago.\n\n56\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.670\nWell, that shouldn't still be\nin my current inbox right now.\n\n57\n00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.080\nI know it's in there somewhere but\nto find it and\n\n58\n00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.990\nto take the time away to have it's\nsearched while I'm still having to do\n\n59\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.440\nwork, very much a difficult thing for\nus to do.\n\n60\n00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.380\nThe other part about\nthe idea of the archive\n\n61\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.500\nis it really does expand out\na users mailbox in that sense,\n\n62\n00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.750\nwhere they're no longer limited\nby a particular size anymore.\n\n63\n00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.720\nAs information starts to grow a little\nbit older, things can get automatically\n\n64\n00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.310\nmoved over there, and\nin that sense there's not a hard quota.\n\n65\n00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.390\nI'm not gonna say that there isn't\na quota in terms of storage size.\n\n66\n00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.150\nBut there isn't a super hard quota\nwhere it's gonna say, all right,\n\n67\n00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.640\nhere it is this is the very last email\nthat we're gonna move over to the archive.\n\n68\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.340\nYou move one more over,\nI'm gonna start dumping information.\n\n69\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.330\nIt's not gonna do that.\n\n70\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.670\nIt's gonna continue to expand and\n\n71\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.290\ngive us a little bit more\nbecause it is archivable.\n\n72\n00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.720\n&gt;&gt; So that's like having an email folder?\n\n73\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.250\n&gt;&gt; To a point, it really is but\nit's about your entire mailbox itself.\n\n74\n00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.092\nSo, it can do it in several ways, the\ndefault way that it does it is that there\n\n75\n00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:12.861\nis a retention policy, and there are other\nthings that are in the same place\n\n76\n00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:17.349\nto where if you turn on the archiving\nability inside of Office 365.\n\n77\n00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.624\nIt says all right we are gonna\nstart doing this archive and\n\n78\n00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:25.580\nthat way it will go through your inbox and\nmy take, let's say the last two years.\n\n79\n00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.090\nAll right, we're gonna allow you to store\nthe last, just let you keep let's say\n\n80\n00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.180\nthe last six months, of your emails\non your computer or what you access.\n\n81\n00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.290\nAll the other ones are gonna be\navailable there if you need to,\n\n82\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.190\nbut we're gonna move that\ninto archival storage.\n\n83\n00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.480\nAnd that makes it easier if you\nneed to go back and search for\n\n84\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.010\nan email that's up to six months old.\n\n85\n00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.110\nDoes it really need to search\nthrough every single email that\n\n86\n00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.310\nwas from 2010 or 2009 as well?\n\n87\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.320\nNot necessarily, but\nif you tell it to, yes, go back and\n\n88\n00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.710\nsearch for more,\nit can go into that archive and do that.\n\n89\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.710\nBut now, you're actually talking\nabout go back into that archive.\n\n90\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.800\nYou're not really telling it just make\nsure I can continue to work and try and\n\n91\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.940\ndo that It becomes a little bit more\nan impossible for us to do this.\n\n92\n00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.030\nSo historical data is\na big part of this too.\n\n93\n00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.840\nThe very fact that we keep\nevery single email and\n\n94\n00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.520\nit really does depend on the regulations\nthat your industry is in.\n\n95\n00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.770\nOr that your business in,\n\n96\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.880\nin the industry that it's in I should say,\nnot the entire industry.\n\n97\n00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.650\nBut it really does depend on that,\n\n98\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.380\nand there may be separate policies that\nsay Ronnie, you can keep that email and\n\n99\n00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.930\nyou need to keep that email for\nthis long of a period of time.\n\n100\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.990\nWell, today though,\nyou might found out that they're saying,\n\n101\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.030\nlook, storage is so cheap,\nyou need to keep every single\n\n102\n00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.770\nemail that you've ever had from\nthe beginning of your organization.\n\n103\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.450\nSo that if there is something that we\nneed to be able to trace, we can find it.\n\n104\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.130\nSo, having to keep it indefinitely\nis another possibility, so\n\n105\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.870\nhow do you do that without\naffecting your company's\n\n106\n00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.940\nactual performance as well\nas anything else there?\n\n107\n00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.350\nArchiving is one of those methodologies\nthat helps us to do that.\n\n108\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.000\nBecause it does.\n\n109\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.330\nIt moves all the other stuff off into\na place that can be historically\n\n110\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.730\nsearched now.\n\n111\n00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.300\nAnd it gives us storage that we\ndon't normally have access to.\n\n112\n00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.900\nAllows us to keep our\norganization efficient too.\n\n113\n00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.674\nSo that is why we should consider the idea\nof using something like archiving\n\n114\n00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:19.144\nbecause it really doesn't affect\nthe way that we have to go through and\n\n115\n00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:23.163\nfind certain information that's\nreally relevant by saying,\n\n116\n00:06:23.163 --> 00:06:25.707\nalso dig through all those other ones.\n\n117\n00:06:25.707 --> 00:06:28.935\nCuz they're still in the same box,\nyou still need to go through and look for\n\n118\n00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:30.790\nevery single possibility that's there.\n\n119\n00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.570\nThe great thing is, it's fairly easy\nto get this thing configured, okay.\n\n120\n00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.874\nSo, we of course are going to focus\nin on both the web UI as well as\n\n121\n00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:42.597\napowershell commands.\n\n122\n00:06:42.597 --> 00:06:46.500\nTo make sure that we understand what we're\nseeing and how we enable this service.\n\n123\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.800\nSo let's start off by taking\na look at the web UI.\n\n124\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.170\nSo here I am on my machine.\n\n125\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.540\nAnd of course, we're gonna go\ninto the exchange admin center.\n\n126\n00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.630\nI clicked on the Admin Tool from the home\nscreen of Joie who is our administrator.\n\n127\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.300\nOver on the left hand side in\nthe navigation pane that you see,\n\n128\n00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.850\nI'm going to select\nthe admin centers icon.\n\n129\n00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.030\nFrom there, we move on to select exchange.\n\n130\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.370\nAnd this is gonna bring us into the EAC,\nthe Exchange Admin Center.\n\n131\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:22.900\nOnce I'm in the Exchange Admin Center\nitself, I now need to day which recipient\n\n132\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:28.170\nis gonna need this archival\npolicy on the mailbox itself.\n\n133\n00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.389\nSo I'm going to select the mailbox.\n\n134\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.203\nUnderneath recipients that we\nsaw in that category view,\n\n135\n00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:39.909\nonce I do that I'm going to select\ntwo I'm gonna select Lance right now.\n\n136\n00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:45.471\nAnd once I have Lance, I'm going to\nselect edit, make sure I didn't,\n\n137\n00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:50.270\nyeah I wanna make sure I\nselected the right one, okay.\n\n138\n00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.158\nOnce I have lance's Selected\nhere on his mailbox.\n\n139\n00:07:55.158 --> 00:08:02.379\nI can now take a look at some of the\ninformation here under mailbox features.\n\n140\n00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:04.605\nMake sure I have this right.\n\n141\n00:08:08.957 --> 00:08:11.820\nAnd this is where, there it is.\n\n142\n00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.870\nI was trying to make sure,\nthe writing becomes so small, right?\n\n143\n00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.730\nSo, look at all this information,\nit's not,\n\n144\n00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:23.860\nyou would think that archival policies and\nstuff, it'd be very prominent, right?\n\n145\n00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.560\nAnd to a point,\nit is prominent if you can find it, but\n\n146\n00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.490\nit is underneath Lance's account,\nand then under mailbox features.\n\n147\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.920\nBut look at this Zack,\nas I scroll down here, and\n\n148\n00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.330\nI keep scrolling,\nI really have to almost come halfway down,\n\n149\n00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.650\nbefore where you see it says,\nArchiving, and currently is Disabled.\n\n150\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.240\nWell, to enable it is fairly easy,\nyou just simply select Enable, and\n\n151\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.650\nthere it is, it's off and\nit's ready to go.\n\n152\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.570\nA lot of times though, if we take\na look right behind my head over here,\n\n153\n00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:01.050\nthis is where you tend to see a summary\nof that same bit of detailed information.\n\n154\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.045\nIf I scroll down over here,\nyou also see it right here underneath,\n\n155\n00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.990\nIn-Place Archive as well.\n\n156\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.370\nSo, those are two of the different\nareas that you'll tend to find,\n\n157\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.860\nthe archival feature that we're talking\nabout, and being able to enable that.\n\n158\n00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.230\nNow, you might say all right, so\nI'm done once I do that, right?\n\n159\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.451\nWell, to a point, but you're not done\nbecause you're also preparing for\n\n160\n00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:24.830\nan exam, okay.\n\n161\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.410\nSo, if it were just that easy, that would\nbe great, I would love to say, but it also\n\n162\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:34.490\nmeans you have to also be familiar with,\nof course, the PowerShell way to do this.\n\n163\n00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.660\nI'm going to clear off my screen to\nmake it a little bit cleaner, and\n\n164\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.690\nwhat we see, it's been a few minutes,\nso I always want to check, and\n\n165\n00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.520\nmake sure that I am still connected here.\n\n166\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.630\nSo there we are, we are still connected,\nI still have availability which is good,\n\n167\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.180\nstill connected to Exchange Online,\nwhich is also good.\n\n168\n00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:58.130\nAt this point, the great thing is\nthis is relatively intuitive here,\n\n169\n00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:03.520\nI want to enable a mailbox feature here.\n\n170\n00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.270\nSo, on this mailbox who am I selecting?\n\n171\n00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.182\nSo, I have this chance, and\n\n172\n00:10:09.182 --> 00:10:14.147\nlet's just say this is gonna be Lance\nat this point, so here I have Lance.\n\n173\n00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:20.125\nNow, I'm gonna do this, so I'm using his\nparticular full name here on the display,\n\n174\n00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:24.859\nso if there's a space a lot of times\nyou do have to remember to include\n\n175\n00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:27.890\nin the actual quotes if you do this.\n\n176\n00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:32.747\nYou can try his alias, if you remember\nwhat his alias is, so his alias is Lance,\n\n177\n00:10:32.747 --> 00:10:38.840\nI'm just gonna do the full name at this\npoint, then it's gonna be -archive.\n\n178\n00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.580\nNow, once I do that, let's see,\nit's either gonna balk at me, or\n\n179\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.760\nit's gonna let me do this.\n\n180\n00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.170\nAnd this is how you know that it is done.\n\n181\n00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.900\nOnce you get the information, and\nyou see its name, the server that it's on,\n\n182\n00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.820\nyou have this ProhibitSendQuota\nabout 99 GB here.\n\n183\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.530\nWell, now we have,\nhopefully everything is enabled.\n\n184\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.160\nAn easy way for us to make sure,\nand go back and\n\n185\n00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.350\ncheck this of course, is we go back\nto our web UI, we refresh the page.\n\n186\n00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.380\nAnd then over in the right hand corner,\n\n187\n00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.440\nnow notice it says Enabled right here,\nand that verifies that we have now\n\n188\n00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.950\nenabled the archiving feature ready for\nLance to actually be able to do this.\n\n189\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.970\nSo, this does allow us to do that.\n\n190\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.626\nNow, doing this on one account is\nprobably not all that we need, and\n\n191\n00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:39.382\nthat is where it gets a little bit\ntrickier in the PowerShell, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:39.382 --> 00:11:44.974\nEven on doing it this way, it's not you\nknow its not bad, but I'm gonna wait, and\n\n193\n00:11:44.974 --> 00:11:50.672\nshow that a little bit later here, because\nits relatively easy in this way, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:50.672 --> 00:11:55.210\nNow, when we start to do this,\nmore than likely your organization,\n\n195\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:00.143\nyou wanna enable archiving for\neverybody, okay, regardless of what size\n\n196\n00:12:00.143 --> 00:12:04.314\nyour accounts actually are,\nthey don't have to be gigantic.\n\n197\n00:12:04.314 --> 00:12:07.486\nBut if there's a feature that's\nreally a good feature to have\n\n198\n00:12:07.486 --> 00:12:10.789\nenabled on every account,\nit is the archiving feature, okay.\n\n199\n00:12:10.789 --> 00:12:14.053\nThat is actually good for everyone\nthat's actually in the organization.\n\n200\n00:12:14.053 --> 00:12:17.339\nIt doesn't take up any more\nspace if you don't use it.\n\n201\n00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:21.885\nBut there is a chance that without using\nit though, you could lose more data\n\n202\n00:12:21.885 --> 00:12:27.050\nthat may be historically significant for\nyour organization than you think.\n\n203\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.399\nSo, enabling it for every account is\none that we may want to consider.\n\n204\n00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:34.735\nNow, if you wanna do something\nlike that though, okay,\n\n205\n00:12:34.735 --> 00:12:37.874\nit requires you to be a little\nbit more programmatic.\n\n206\n00:12:37.874 --> 00:12:41.569\nAnd that means you have to be willing\nto tie a couple of things together, and\n\n207\n00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:44.900\nthat is what we are going to\ndo here in the PowerShell.\n\n208\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.758\nSo, instead I'm gonna do a Get-Mailbox,\n\n209\n00:12:49.758 --> 00:12:53.970\nthis time we are going to run a filter.\n\n210\n00:12:56.498 --> 00:13:02.032\nWe're gonna use the fancy\nbrackets to help us out here,\n\n211\n00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:04.900\nto find the ArchiveStatus.\n\n212\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.440\nAnd what I'm looking for\nis every archive status,\n\n213\n00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:14.780\nEq, which means equal of course, to None,\n\n214\n00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.870\nin other words, is there an archive\nstatus that's set to none?\n\n215\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.900\nI don't really wanna affect any\nof those archives right now,\n\n216\n00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.850\nthat are already enabled as on,\nor enabled here.\n\n217\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.690\nI wanna make sure that I'm\nlooking at one that has none.\n\n218\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.883\nThen we're gonna do another operator AND.\n\n219\n00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:39.192\nAnd this one is gonna be\n\n220\n00:13:39.192 --> 00:13:45.346\nrecipienttypedetails -eq User,\n\n221\n00:13:45.346 --> 00:13:52.533\nwhoops, let me zoom out here, Mailbox.\n\n222\n00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.830\nAnd then close that.\n\n223\n00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.170\nNow this is the first part of\nthe statement that we're doing.\n\n224\n00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:07.270\nIt's telling me, let me go ahead and\nget the mailbox, as long as the archive\n\n225\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:12.653\nstatus is None, and as long as it is\na UserMailbox as well, all right.\n\n226\n00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:19.190\nThen we are going to pipe this into,\nin other words take that information\n\n227\n00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.750\non all the mailboxes that doesn't\nhave the archive bit set, and\n\n228\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:28.239\nthat's the user mailbox,\nthen we're gonna do Enable-Mailbox,\n\n229\n00:14:28.239 --> 00:14:33.570\nand we're gonna tell it to turn on\nthe archive, that's what we're gonna do.\n\n230\n00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.058\nWhen it does his wrap down,\n\n231\n00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:39.214\nI have to check the spelling cuz I never\nknow cuz my typing is really that bad.\n\n232\n00:14:44.131 --> 00:14:47.207\nAll right, I always have to check for\nthese fancy brackets,\n\n233\n00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:49.570\nmake sure I open them and close them.\n\n234\n00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:53.938\nSo, I always kinda go back and\nforth a little bit, once I do that and\n\n235\n00:14:53.938 --> 00:14:54.955\nI press Enter.\n\n236\n00:14:57.131 --> 00:15:00.498\nNow, you can see that\nI had three accounts,\n\n237\n00:15:00.498 --> 00:15:05.412\nwe had just manually enabled it for\nLance, it went through, and\n\n238\n00:15:05.412 --> 00:15:11.330\nit saw joey as well as jt's name,\nthat the archive bit was set to None.\n\n239\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.090\nIt found their UserMailboxes here, and\n\n240\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.850\nthen it ran it through the second\npart of that line that we typed in,\n\n241\n00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.519\nwhich was essentially the same thing\nwe are that we ran on Joey's account,\n\n242\n00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:29.480\nEnable-Mailbox -archive, and\nnotice it wouldn't had and did that too.\n\n243\n00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.160\nSo, it assigned both of\nthem to be able to do that.\n\n244\n00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.628\nSo, if I want to confirm it in\nthe PowerShell, at least for\n\n245\n00:15:38.628 --> 00:15:42.277\nany one of them,\nI can always go to mailbox, and\n\n246\n00:15:42.277 --> 00:15:47.497\nwe'll pick on jt this time,\ntell it to actually FL for filter list.\n\n247\n00:15:49.785 --> 00:15:54.466\nAnd then we're gonna tell it to look for\nanything that begins, and\n\n248\n00:15:54.466 --> 00:15:59.658\nthen has the word archive in it, and\nends with anything, and there we go.\n\n249\n00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:07.129\nSo, here you can see the archive name And\nthere it is for Justin Timberlake.\n\n250\n00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:12.200\nSo, we can verify that this is,\nthat everything is actually set.\n\n251\n00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.408\nYou can also see the archive\nstatus now is Active too.\n\n252\n00:16:17.408 --> 00:16:20.631\nSo that's allow you to be able to find and\nverify that,\n\n253\n00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:26.080\nthat information is correct in the way\nthat it wants to, that it needs to be.\n\n254\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.547\nSo, very simple but yet at the same time,\nif you're not familiar with it,\n\n255\n00:16:29.547 --> 00:16:32.754\nit's gonna be a little bit tricky,\nespecially in that PowerShell.\n\n256\n00:16:32.754 --> 00:16:35.624\nAnd that's something that we wanna\nmake sure that we understand,\n\n257\n00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:37.740\nit's got to be a part of it, right?\n\n258\n00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.380\nSo, if it were me,\neveryday of the week, Zach, I would say,\n\n259\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.031\nlet's just work in the Web UI,\ndon't ever worry about this.\n\n260\n00:16:45.031 --> 00:16:48.861\nBut the very fact is getting ready for\nthe exam and people that really love this,\n\n261\n00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:51.370\nthey of course can do this all day long.\n\n262\n00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.793\nI can do it, as long as I've actually\npracticed it, and made sure that I do it.\n\n263\n00:16:54.793 --> 00:16:57.830\nBut if I did it every day, I'd probably\nget more used to this as well.\n\n264\n00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:02.741\nBut that's something you'll definitely\nhave to make sure that you do understand\n\n265\n00:17:02.741 --> 00:17:05.170\nas you get ready for the exam two, okay?\n\n266\n00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.212\nNow, the next thing that we also\nhave to understand is that,\n\n267\n00:17:09.212 --> 00:17:14.526\neven though we have the archive set,\nthere's also built into Office 365 for\n\n268\n00:17:14.526 --> 00:17:19.210\nan email boxes, is what we call\na default retention policy.\n\n269\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.870\nNow, this kinda name strangely, they don't\nof course call it, default retention\n\n270\n00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:29.980\npolicy, there's a particular\nacronym that they use, MRM, okay?\n\n271\n00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.500\nWhich is something like message retention\nmanagement, is what they call it, MRM.\n\n272\n00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:41.830\nSo, you would think, it's easy enough\njust call it default retention policy.\n\n273\n00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.500\nNo, don't do something like that.\n\n274\n00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.720\nBut they call it MRM, message retention\nmanagement is what they call it.\n\n275\n00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.850\nAnd that particular policy that's set up\npretty much right from the beginning says,\n\n276\n00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.220\nhow long are essentially emails kept,\nokay, and what we have.\n\n277\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.420\nAll right, now,\nif we do have the archive turned on,\n\n278\n00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.450\nthe way that the default\npolicy ends up working,\n\n279\n00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.620\nokay, is that items that are essentially\ngreater than two years old.\n\n280\n00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.100\nBy default are moved into the archive,\nokay?\n\n281\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.760\nNow, if you don't have it set,\nwell, it's not on at all.\n\n282\n00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.750\nOkay, but if you do have it set,\nit will get moved into the archive itself.\n\n283\n00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.310\nThere's a special folder,\n\n284\n00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:25.970\nas well that you also have, that's\ncalled the Recoverable Items folder too.\n\n285\n00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.120\nNow this one's a little bit\nunusual in the very fact that,\n\n286\n00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.600\nif you have items in this\nparticular folder for your mailbox,\n\n287\n00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:41.100\nif you have items that are 14 days or\nolder, okay, they'll end up also getting\n\n288\n00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.690\nmoved into the recoverable items\nin your archive as well, okay?\n\n289\n00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.020\nAnd that is something that we\ndefinitely want to make sure of.\n\n290\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.680\nSo that default policy is\nsetup right there for us.\n\n291\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.460\nSo in theory, Zach,\n\n292\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:00.570\nand we didn't wanna do anything else to\nour entirety of the archive that we have,\n\n293\n00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:05.130\nthe great thing is, we already have kind\nof the basic setup that we can archive.\n\n294\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.903\n&gt;&gt; Now, if my organization's default\nretention policy doesn't meet my\n\n295\n00:19:09.903 --> 00:19:14.211\norganization's need,\ncan I create custom retention policy?\n\n296\n00:19:14.211 --> 00:19:15.332\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Zach.\nOf course,\n\n297\n00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:17.960\nthis is actually something that we can do.\n\n298\n00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.900\nThe default policy really doesn't\nfit every single bill, but\n\n299\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.150\nat least gives us a place to\nstart that we can do something.\n\n300\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.430\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the machine so\n\n301\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.540\nthat we can actually figure\nthis out a little bit more.\n\n302\n00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.934\nSo, we wanna take a look at that\nidea of that default policy,\n\n303\n00:19:33.934 --> 00:19:36.441\nwhich we've taken a look at here.\n\n304\n00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:40.739\nA couple of ways where we can create\nthat new policy is by going into\n\n305\n00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:45.100\nthe Compliance Management on\nthe Exchange Admin Center.\n\n306\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:51.250\nSo, if I select Compliance, there is that\ndefault MRM Policy for us to do this.\n\n307\n00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.710\nSo, there is a contention\nout there that we do here.\n\n308\n00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.460\nSome people really say,\nyou should never modify this policy, and\n\n309\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.180\nother people feel perfectly\nfine with modifying this,\n\n310\n00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.240\nI don't really have an opinion one way or\nthe other on which one.\n\n311\n00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.120\nThey both seem to work but\nsome people say if you modify this,\n\n312\n00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.880\nyou'll cause things to go\na little bit more haywire.\n\n313\n00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.480\nSo of course,\nwhat we're gonna do instead is follow\n\n314\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.410\nkinda this safety issue which we\nwould click on new and it's here.\n\n315\n00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.840\nThis is where we would\ncreate a new custom policy.\n\n316\n00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.890\nAnd its relatively easy\nenough in the Web UI, right?\n\n317\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.830\nWe give it a name, and then we go ahead\nand we create what we call Retention tags.\n\n318\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.200\nRetention tag essentially is\nthe filters that we're gonna use\n\n319\n00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.920\nto make the policy follow through.\n\n320\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.556\nOnce we create that NAME and that TYPE,\nremember that two key elements here is,\n\n321\n00:20:39.556 --> 00:20:41.414\nto actually create a retention period.\n\n322\n00:20:41.414 --> 00:20:43.234\nHow long that's gonna be retained?\n\n323\n00:20:43.234 --> 00:20:46.212\nAnd then,\nonce that hits that particular policy,\n\n324\n00:20:46.212 --> 00:20:50.227\nthe action that is gonna take from\nthere whether it's to archive it or\n\n325\n00:20:50.227 --> 00:20:54.740\nto delete it, whether it may be\nthat is what we're going to see.\n\n326\n00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.830\nNow, because it's actually relatively\neasy here, and of course means,\n\n327\n00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:02.167\nthat we also need to take a look\nat in the PowerShell itself.\n\n328\n00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.145\nNow, when we start doing this, remember\nthat, we can actually create policies\n\n329\n00:21:06.145 --> 00:21:11.880\norganization-wide, okay,\nthat affect everybody at one time.\n\n330\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.800\nBut that may not be the best bet for us.\n\n331\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.426\nAnd the reason why, is affecting\nthe entire organization with a policy.\n\n332\n00:21:19.426 --> 00:21:24.350\nMaybe something that we might want\nto test out before we actually say,\n\n333\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.630\nyes, this is great for\nthe entire organization.\n\n334\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.320\nIn a small organization,\nthere's no big deal.\n\n335\n00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.438\nYou have five, ten, 15 people that,\n\n336\n00:21:30.438 --> 00:21:34.120\nsome might going,\nthis isn't working the way they want to.\n\n337\n00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.810\nIt's easy enough to roll back.\n\n338\n00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.550\nBut when you start having 5,000 people,\nand\n\n339\n00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:42.820\nit takes a long time to roll these palsies\nout, and to essentially stop them from\n\n340\n00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.760\nworking, you may lose more\nthat you think that you would.\n\n341\n00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.297\nSo, I don't recommend necessarily\nan organization while in policy,\n\n342\n00:21:51.297 --> 00:21:55.235\nunless you have completely\n100% tested out everything.\n\n343\n00:21:55.235 --> 00:21:59.407\nAnd made sure that's gonna work the way\nthat you wanna work in a test environment,\n\n344\n00:21:59.407 --> 00:22:01.360\nas I would make sure of, okay?\n\n345\n00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.330\nBut, the good thing is, we're really\nfocused in on that individual policy\n\n346\n00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.830\nmore than anything else as we do this.\n\n347\n00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.810\nSo, when we take a look at it from\nright in the PowerShell then,\n\n348\n00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:17.110\nI'm simply going to type in Get-Mailbox.\n\n349\n00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.730\nThen I'm going to select\nthe mailbox that I want to\n\n350\n00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.696\naffect by using identity type in an alias.\n\n351\n00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:30.975\nAt this point, I wanna actually see\nwhat's actually in the alias, so\n\n352\n00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:33.473\nI'm gonna tell it to\nformat the table by alias.\n\n353\n00:22:35.757 --> 00:22:37.576\nAnd, retention policy.\n\n354\n00:22:39.142 --> 00:22:41.374\nIf I can spell retention, that would help.\n\n355\n00:22:41.374 --> 00:22:43.101\nRetention Policy.\n\n356\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.580\nSpelling has never been\nmy strong suit either.\n\n357\n00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.575\nOkay, so we can see,\nin the upper left-hand corner,\n\n358\n00:22:51.575 --> 00:22:55.159\nwhere lance is currently affected\nby the the Default MRM Policy,\n\n359\n00:22:55.159 --> 00:22:59.223\nwhich is exactly what we expected,\ncuz we haven't set any other policy.\n\n360\n00:22:59.223 --> 00:23:03.911\nNow, if we want to set a new policy then,\nwe would do set\n\n361\n00:23:05.682 --> 00:23:11.980\nMailbox, same thing, we're gonna call the\nsame identity for lance, at this point.\n\n362\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:19.244\nThen we can type in Retention,\noops, Policy.\n\n363\n00:23:19.244 --> 00:23:20.815\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; P-O, yeah.\n\n364\n00:23:20.815 --> 00:23:22.650\n&gt;&gt; You're almost there.\n\n365\n00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.323\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had a C, I had a U.\n\n366\n00:23:23.323 --> 00:23:27.510\n[LAUGH] You know what, I don't know\nwhy I can't hit a P for Policy here.\n\n367\n00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.848\nSo, once I have this, right,\nI can set a Retention Policy,\n\n368\n00:23:30.848 --> 00:23:33.410\nand I can just call this\none whatever I want to.\n\n369\n00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:34.115\nI can give it a name.\n\n370\n00:23:34.115 --> 00:23:40.500\nNow, let's just call this one 10 Days,\ncuz I don't have have any other here.\n\n371\n00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.115\nNow, I haven't actually created,\nwhat, the action,\n\n372\n00:23:43.115 --> 00:23:45.490\nnor did I actually do anything else, okay?\n\n373\n00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.850\nI've just quote it\nsomething at this point.\n\n374\n00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.140\nBut for right now,\nthis is what we'd have to do,\n\n375\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.100\nis that we just go ahead and create this.\n\n376\n00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.232\nIf everything is working,\nwe should see this.\n\n377\n00:23:55.463 --> 00:23:58.317\nAll right, so\nas I take a look at the error here and\n\n378\n00:23:58.317 --> 00:24:02.845\nit tells me that wasn't found, I just\nrealized something I did miss creating\n\n379\n00:24:02.845 --> 00:24:05.228\nthe retention policy I was supposed to.\n\n380\n00:24:05.228 --> 00:24:09.693\nI just went in and told it to essentially\nassign this particular policy, but\n\n381\n00:24:09.693 --> 00:24:12.110\nI don't have a policy called 10Days.\n\n382\n00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:18.120\nFor me to be able to do this, I need to\ntype in New-RetentionPolicy and then we'll\n\n383\n00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:23.710\njust give it the name here and I'll just\nmake sure it's 10Days for right now.\n\n384\n00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.420\nAnd we'll press Enter.\n\n385\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.140\nAnd once I do so,\nthat will create that new policy.\n\n386\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.860\nNow I need to assign that to, well,\nLance's mailbox is what I need to do.\n\n387\n00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.693\nSo it is here that I should be able to\nrun, essentially, the same command right\n\n388\n00:24:39.693 --> 00:24:44.745\nabove the red Identity, if I can spell it.\n\n389\n00:24:44.745 --> 00:24:48.121\nIdentity, Lance,\n\n390\n00:24:48.121 --> 00:24:52.887\nand then retention, oops,\n\n391\n00:24:52.887 --> 00:25:01.635\nI can't spell RetentionPolicy [LAUGH],\n10Days.\n\n392\n00:25:04.144 --> 00:25:09.638\nWait, see what I did there, again, typo, a\nspace right in the middle is what you see,\n\n393\n00:25:09.638 --> 00:25:14.100\nI was like, okay,\nthat's getting ridiculous at this point.\n\n394\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:19.250\nLet me now try this, this way you\nactually see the typos, like I said,\n\n395\n00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:25.410\npretty much my particular worst enemies as\nwe start to see something like this here.\n\n396\n00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:28.590\nBut this gives you at\nleast a good example then\n\n397\n00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:33.930\nof what has to happen as we start to\ncreate these types of custom policies.\n\n398\n00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.110\nSo this moves us away from at least\nthe very beginning here on that default\n\n399\n00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.810\npolicy, shows us what we can\ndo to create a custom one.\n\n400\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.910\nNow, if you don't like doing this\nin PowerShell, I understand, but\n\n401\n00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:48.250\nmake sure you do pay attention\nof what we did, right?\n\n402\n00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.470\nWe essentially went ahead and\n\n403\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.700\nwe took a look at getting a list\nof those retention policies.\n\n404\n00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.170\nWe selected the email\naddress that we wanted.\n\n405\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.400\nThis is part that I forgot\nwhich was right here,\n\n406\n00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.770\nwhich is to create the retention policy\nand then I assigned it to that mailbox.\n\n407\n00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:08.949\nSo once everything is done, now this\nparticular policy is gonna be assigned\n\n408\n00:26:08.949 --> 00:26:10.853\nhere so that we can as you see this.\n\n409\n00:26:10.853 --> 00:26:16.415\nSo let's verify, get-mailbox,and\n\n410\n00:26:16.415 --> 00:26:21.470\nthis one again is identity Lance and\n\n411\n00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:26.862\nnow we're gonna tell it to pipe it into\n\n412\n00:26:26.862 --> 00:26:32.760\nthe format table, Alias and Retention,\n\n413\n00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.170\nif I can spell it, RetentionPolicy.\n\n414\n00:26:40.205 --> 00:26:43.360\nIn a moment here you'll see where\nthis changed from what we had\n\n415\n00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.760\na little bit earlier which\nsaid the default MRM policy.\n\n416\n00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:51.530\nSo this gives you that ability to know and\nto confirm that we have changed the policy\n\n417\n00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.810\non the way that Lance's\nmailbox is now configured.\n\n418\n00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.794\nSo this provides that customized, that\npersonal policy that we have in place for\n\n419\n00:26:58.794 --> 00:27:01.220\nretaining the information that we have.\n\n420\n00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.900\nAs well as talking about\nthe archiving that we've been doing.\n\n421\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.350\nSo that should help us\nto get set in place.\n\n422\n00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:10.160\nSo there's still more to go but\nhere, Zach, I have once again\n\n423\n00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.940\ntalked the time away and that means we\nprobably need to go into another part.\n\n424\n00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Did a great job Ronnie.\n\n425\n00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:19.030\nWe do need to continue with\nconfiguring personal archive policies.\n\n426\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:23.170\nAs we also continue with enabling\nOffice 365 services, right?\n\n427\n00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:23.940\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n428\n00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you wanna stay tuned for that.\n\n429\n00:27:26.070 -->

00:00:12.430\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.950\nmaking the intelligent\nchoice to watch ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.510\nI am your host, Zack Memos, for\nEnabling Office 365 Services.\n\n6\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.290\nAs we configure personal archive policies,\n\n7\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.440\npart two, with our IT professional,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.410\nRonnie, thanks for being here again.\n\n9\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.660\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you again for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n10\n00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.940\nAs we continue on taking\na look at more Office 365.\n\n11\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.960\nAs well as just making sure that we\nunderstand this idea of personal archive\n\n12\n00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.970\npolicies.\n\n13\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.700\nWe've already taken a look, of course,\nat how you set up archive policies.\n\n14\n00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.390\nWe've done a bit of configuration also,\n\n15\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.660\nin the web interface,\nas well as in the PowerShell.\n\n16\n00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.540\nAnd now we've got to continue to move\nforward with that a little bit more.\n\n17\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.410\nWhere we're now talking about not\nonly creating those policies.\n\n18\n00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.070\nBut when we start doing it in PowerShell,\n\n19\n00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.930\nwe'll see that we have to\nmanually do everything else.\n\n20\n00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.290\nInside of the web UI,\nit really is just a few clicks.\n\n21\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.170\nAnd when you do that,\nit configures everything for you.\n\n22\n00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.490\nNot only making the policy, so that it's\nready to go in the entire organization.\n\n23\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.250\nBut it also says, well,\nwhat do you want the policy to do?\n\n24\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.620\nHow do you wanna name this?\n\n25\n00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.230\nWhere do you want to apply it?\n\n26\n00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.320\nWho is it going to apply to?\n\n27\n00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.150\nWho isn't it going to apply to?\n\n28\n00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.210\nIt does everything, and all we're\ndoing is putting in a couple of words.\n\n29\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.310\nMaybe some numbers, and maybe a check\nbox or two every once in a while.\n\n30\n00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.140\nAnd you hit Apply or\nyou hit Save, and it's done.\n\n31\n00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.830\nBut in the PowerShell, though, you've\ngot to manually do all of that stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.780\nBefore everything comes together to\neverything that we want it to be.\n\n33\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.610\nSo now, what we're doing is,\n\n34\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.180\nwe are taking a look at not only\nsetting up that policy that way.\n\n35\n00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.590\nBut now we are taking a look at creating,\nreally, what we call retention tags.\n\n36\n00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.110\nIs what we are actually\ntalking about creating here.\n\n37\n00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.710\nAnd there are many retention\ntags that already,\n\n38\n00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.360\nby default, embedded into the system.\n\n39\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.250\nThings that have been there, usually\ntime limit things, is what we normally.\n\n40\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.360\nSo how long do you wanna keep\nthis before you delete it?\n\n41\n00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.430\nOr, how long do you want something to be\nthere before it actually gets archived?\n\n42\n00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.920\nA lot of things are already in there for\nus.\n\n43\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.410\nBut if we don't find something\nthat meets our requirements, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.770\nSo this is where we can go in.\n\n45\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.690\nAnd we can actually create what we call,\nof course, a custom retention tag.\n\n46\n00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.140\nWell, of course, that means, not only\ndo you have to be able to do that, and\n\n47\n00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.316\nfigure that out with the web UI.\n\n48\n00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:34.330\nIt also means PowerShelling\nsome time in there, as well.\n\n49\n00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.010\nSo that is what we are also going to do,\ntoo.\n\n50\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.340\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look on our machine.\n\n51\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.220\nAnd I am connected to the Office\n365 admin center, ready?\n\n52\n00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.943\nNow, it means I need to go into\nthe exchange admin center, or\n\n53\n00:02:48.943 --> 00:02:50.331\nalso known as the EAC.\n\n54\n00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:55.110\nSo over on the left hand side,\nI'm going to use this navigation bar.\n\n55\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.100\nDown at the very bottom,\nI'm going to see that little icon,\n\n56\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.700\nwith the little A over here.\n\n57\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.870\nRemember that if your screen,\nif you have a larger resolution, or\n\n58\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.280\na higher resolution.\n\n59\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.410\nIt's probably gonna say\nAdmin Center right next to it.\n\n60\n00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.000\nSo you shouldn't have any\nproblems with ambiguity or\n\n61\n00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.940\nfiguring that one out,\nit should be fairly easy.\n\n62\n00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.390\nOnce we're inside of\nthe exchange admin center.\n\n63\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.365\nIt is from here that we need to make\nsure we understand how to navigate\n\n64\n00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.660\nto where we can find\nthe retention policies.\n\n65\n00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.340\nAnd on the exam, this is crucial.\n\n66\n00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.360\nIt's nothing that's going to give way for\n\n67\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.850\nyou to just go,\nwell I'll just keep searching for it.\n\n68\n00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.720\nSometimes, they might give you something\nwhere you are gonna click through.\n\n69\n00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.030\nAnd try and\nfigure out exactly where you're going.\n\n70\n00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.430\nBut a lot of times, it's just,\ndo you know where to go?\n\n71\n00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.840\nThey might even just say, hey,\nwould you go to recipients, permissions,\n\n72\n00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.990\norganizations, compliance management?\n\n73\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.890\nWhere would you go to set\nthese retention tags?\n\n74\n00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.680\nSo it might be just something\nas generic as that,\n\n75\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.050\nbut they're not gonna tell\nyou exactly everything else.\n\n76\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.020\nSo at this point you've just\ngot to know what to do.\n\n77\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.740\nSo from here I'm going to select\nmailboxes, is what I'm going to do.\n\n78\n00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.500\nAnd then inside of mailboxes,\n\n79\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.320\nI think I actually clicked on the wrong\none, now that I tell you that.\n\n80\n00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.030\nSo let me select a little bit differently.\n\n81\n00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.910\nLet's go, let me see if I can go backward.\n\n82\n00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.940\nCuz, see what I was telling you,\n\n83\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.030\nI have absolutely, see that's what\nhappens when you don't remember.\n\n84\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.450\nBut it's actually not there, it's under\ncompliance, if I remember correctly.\n\n85\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.960\nSo let me select the exchange\nadmin center again.\n\n86\n00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.060\nAnd then, once we come here, you have\nto go underneath compliance management.\n\n87\n00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.950\nOnce you're actually in\ncompliance managent,\n\n88\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.380\nnow you can notice across the top.\n\n89\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.660\nYou'll see where it says retention tags.\n\n90\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.396\nSo that's what we´re taking look at.\n\n91\n00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:43.320\nSo that's why it's actually\nvery important, right?\n\n92\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.310\nI didn't intentionally\ngo to the wrong place.\n\n93\n00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.060\nBut I just wanted you to see if you go,\n\n94\n00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.448\nI think I now exactly where\nthese are gonna be set.\n\n95\n00:04:50.448 --> 00:04:55.120\nYou're gonna be wrong, if you haven't\nvisited before, especially on the exam.\n\n96\n00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.400\nNow most of you that are preparing for\n\n97\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.140\nthis exam,\nyou probably knew exactly where it was.\n\n98\n00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.765\nBut if you didn't, it means you've gotta\nspend time inside that user interface, or\n\n99\n00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:05.200\nyou can really get lost.\n\n100\n00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.690\nThere is just so\nmany places that you can get lost in this.\n\n101\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.740\nAnd that's because everything\nis kind of loaded up.\n\n102\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.990\nBuried inside of a menu\nupon a menu upon a menu.\n\n103\n00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.670\nJust make sure that you get there.\n\n104\n00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.290\nSo once you're in the admin center,\ncompliance management,\n\n105\n00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.740\nthen notice that there is retention tags.\n\n106\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.730\nWe've already talked about these\nretention policies a little bit.\n\n107\n00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.160\nNow if I select these retention tags,\n\n108\n00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.160\nthis is where we are setting\nup kind of the criteria.\n\n109\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.580\nThat we're saying, here's how long\nwe are going to retain things.\n\n110\n00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.580\nAnd I told you that by default,\nyou can see all of these right here, Zack.\n\n111\n00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.180\nThat I didn't set any of these things up,\nokay?\n\n112\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.190\nSo on these, I really had no,\n\n113\n00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.080\nI'm trying to make sure we can see\njust at least the majority of them.\n\n114\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.590\nThere we go.\n\n115\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.640\nThere's 12 total, and\nthat are set up for us.\n\n116\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.745\nAnd you can see where they\nkind of say this, right?\n\n117\n00:05:53.745 --> 00:05:57.810\nOne-month delete,\nthis is a personal type of retention.\n\n118\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.780\nFor 30 days, and then delete what's there.\n\n119\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.930\nHere's one, after one week,\none year, six months.\n\n120\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.090\nWhatever you might have,\nwe essentially can set this up right here.\n\n121\n00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.880\nNow, it doesn't mean that it\napplies to everything, right?\n\n122\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.250\nIt means, we're creating a bank\nof different tags that we can\n\n123\n00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.170\nuse inside of our policies.\n\n124\n00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.280\nBut at this point, here are the defaults\nthat most people will say, all right.\n\n125\n00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.140\nI'm gonna start off with this and\nsee what happens.\n\n126\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.390\nAnd it's a good thing, right?\n\n127\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.230\nThe very fact that we can test and\nsee how this works.\n\n128\n00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.400\nYou may say, I wanna try after a week, and\n\n129\n00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.610\nsee if this does exactly what\nI think it is going to do.\n\n130\n00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.080\nAnd that really is a good test for you.\n\n131\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.670\nYou might even set one up for 30 days.\n\n132\n00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.620\nMost of us are probably not gonna do,\nthe idea of the Never Delete too much.\n\n133\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.900\nBut there are some that\nyou wanna keep forever.\n\n134\n00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.880\nYou can think about,\nespecially for your mailboxes.\n\n135\n00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.729\nThat there are, there may be some\nitems that you go, all right.\n\n136\n00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.520\nA long as it actually has this\ntag in here for Never Delete.\n\n137\n00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.840\nI'm gonna make sure that I keep it\nforever, regardless of how long it is.\n\n138\n00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.890\nPersonal one year, five year, personal\nnever move to the archive, you name it.\n\n139\n00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.989\nThere's a bunch of different things that\nreally at least give you a nice little\n\n140\n00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.630\nexample, right, that you can do.\n\n141\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.220\nBut what if none of these\nmeets our requirements?\n\n142\n00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.860\nWell the great thing,\nis that's where we can come up here and\n\n143\n00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.250\nuse these different\nicons that it gives us.\n\n144\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.620\nAnd if I want to create a new one,\n\n145\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.440\nI'm gonna select this little\nplus sign with this drop down.\n\n146\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.060\nAnd you can see,\n\n147\n00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.360\nas I hover over it, it gives me\na little tool tip that says, New Tag.\n\n148\n00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.900\nAnd then if I click on it,\n\n149\n00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.830\nnow this is where we need to pay\nattention right here for just a moment.\n\n150\n00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.620\nLet me zoom in a little bit more,\nso we can see this.\n\n151\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.270\nApplied automatically\nto the entire mailbox.\n\n152\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.250\nAnd that's a default\nsetting that you have.\n\n153\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.740\nAnd that means, hey if you want to,\n\n154\n00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.290\nyou can create a retention tag that\napplies to everything in my mailbox.\n\n155\n00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.821\nSo, Zack, for just a moment.\n\n156\n00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:56.985\nIf you think about, your mailbox\nincludes a inbox it, includes an outbox,\n\n157\n00:07:56.985 --> 00:07:59.080\nin other words, things you sent out.\n\n158\n00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.629\nIt includes, or sending out, excuse me.\n\n159\n00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:07.855\nIt includes things that are in your sent\nitems Your trash can or deleted files.\n\n160\n00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:10.937\nIt includes a ton of stuff and\nI can say that if I do this,\n\n161\n00:08:10.937 --> 00:08:13.730\nit's gonna apply to the entire mailbox.\n\n162\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:19.385\nBut notice, if I wanted to, I can lend\nit to a particular folder, instead.\n\n163\n00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:23.979\nSo if I go, I want to make sure that\nmy inbox, that whatever policy I\n\n164\n00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:28.860\ncreate is gonna only apply to the inbox,\nI can do that as well.\n\n165\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.510\nOr, applied by users to items in folders.\n\n166\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.560\nSo I can even have it where a user can\nactually say, I want to actually be able\n\n167\n00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.950\nto do this on a particular item, or\nthey can choose the folder that they want.\n\n168\n00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.100\nSo, all of this is very\npossible if you do this.\n\n169\n00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.760\nSo it just depends on what you\nwant to be able to do, right?\n\n170\n00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.002\nNow, we're not gonna create it right here,\nwe're gonna create it inside\n\n171\n00:08:51.002 --> 00:08:54.630\nthe PowerShell but I just wanted to\nat least show this portion of it.\n\n172\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:59.870\nBut remember that every single retention\ntag, that we also create, in policy.\n\n173\n00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:04.263\nUsually on the policies there's a couple\nof options that we want to make sure of.\n\n174\n00:09:04.263 --> 00:09:08.498\nOkay, remember that if we create\na policy there has to of course be\n\n175\n00:09:08.498 --> 00:09:11.821\na retention period, and\nthen a retention action.\n\n176\n00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:15.770\n&gt;&gt; In a retention tag though,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n177\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.350\nBut notice, it still follows\nthe same nomenclature, here.\n\n178\n00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.610\nIt says retention action.\n\n179\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:27.800\nDelete and allow recovery,\npermanently delete, move to archive,\n\n180\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.040\nand then the retention period when\nan item reaches a particular day and age.\n\n181\n00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.940\nNow, this is really nice of\nwhat Office 365 has done.\n\n182\n00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.690\nAs I scroll out just a little bit more,\nlet me see if I can hover and\n\n183\n00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.810\nget what I need here, maybe.\n\n184\n00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.000\nThere we go, okay.\n\n185\n00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.087\nSo over on the right hand side,\nwhat you're looking at, of course,\n\n186\n00:09:46.087 --> 00:09:47.807\nis just what we call another tool tip.\n\n187\n00:09:47.807 --> 00:09:50.742\nIt tells us,\nif we're not sure which one to choose,\n\n188\n00:09:50.742 --> 00:09:54.631\nit gives us a little bit of guidance\nover there on the right hand side.\n\n189\n00:09:54.631 --> 00:10:00.110\nDelete and allow recovery,\npermanent delete, move to archive.\n\n190\n00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.120\nYou do wanna be careful.\n\n191\n00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.680\nAnytime you say permanently delete, it\nmeans you're not going to recover it and\n\n192\n00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.250\nthat's kind of scary\nin a business setting.\n\n193\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:15.170\nAs a personal user, you'd kinda go, okay,\nI accept all the consequences to it.\n\n194\n00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.610\nBut when you're doing this for\n\n195\n00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:21.620\na business, you really need to talk\nto whoever decision-makers are.\n\n196\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.530\nAnd make sure that you understand,\nand they understand,\n\n197\n00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.480\nwhat we're talking about\nin this situation.\n\n198\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.970\nBecause if not,\nnow all of a sudden they say, all right,\n\n199\n00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:35.230\nwe need to go back to that email\nthat was sent in January of 2009.\n\n200\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.970\nAnd now you're saying,\n\n201\n00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.870\nwell, everything that's older than\ntwo years old is permanently deleted.\n\n202\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.270\nAnd they'll say, there's a way\nyou've gotta be able to recover it.\n\n203\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.370\nThere really isn't a way that you\ncan recover it if you do that.\n\n204\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.490\nSo, especially if\neverything is in the cloud,\n\n205\n00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.900\nbecause it's no longer on\nour own personal storage.\n\n206\n00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.950\nIt's not like we removed the hard\ndrive and set it aside somewhere.\n\n207\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.629\nIn that cloud storage that\nparticular drive might have\n\n208\n00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:59.962\nactually been reprovisioned for\neven somebody else at that point.\n\n209\n00:10:59.962 --> 00:11:03.290\nOr reprovisioned and\nwiped clean to do other things.\n\n210\n00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.010\nSo you have to be very careful in how you\nchoose this type of retention period and\n\n211\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.980\npolicy that you have available.\n\n212\n00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.540\nSo just make sure you take a note and\n\n213\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.750\nunderstand what it is that\nyou're setting up here.\n\n214\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.062\nSo, go in, make sure you understand\nthe settings that are right here as well,\n\n215\n00:11:19.062 --> 00:11:20.020\nall right.\n\n216\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.470\nSo, hopefully that makes sense that,\nhere it is.\n\n217\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.690\nRemember that if we create a policy,\n\n218\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.220\nusually there's gonna be a tag that we're\nalso gonna associate with that policy.\n\n219\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.210\nThen we're gonna apply it of course\nto either an individual mailbox or\n\n220\n00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.590\nwe're gonna apply it\nto a lot of mailboxes.\n\n221\n00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.095\nIt pretty much depends\non what we wanna do.\n\n222\n00:11:38.105 --> 00:11:43.359\nSo if I wanted to create a new retention\ntag from the PowerShell key here,\n\n223\n00:11:43.359 --> 00:11:48.458\nright, just like I said every time so\nfar in just about every episode.\n\n224\n00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:52.076\nThat if you're gonna do this from\nPowerShell and you're hosting\n\n225\n00:11:52.076 --> 00:11:57.330\neverything online just like we are,\nwe don't have anything on premises here.\n\n226\n00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.490\nI need to make sure that I am connected.\n\n227\n00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:06.520\nSo at this particular point,\nnotice I have opened and let's see here\n\n228\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:12.660\nremote machine this is,\nlet's see what else here.\n\n229\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.250\nI should see one that says, exchange.\n\n230\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.490\nAnd this is why I'm kind of hesitating\nhere because this one does not say\n\n231\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.420\nexchange here, which means that I\nneed to go ahead and connect back in.\n\n232\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.300\nSo we're just gonna take a moment and\nmake sure that I am connected back in.\n\n233\n00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.890\nSo you'll get to see this process\nas what we'll take a look at.\n\n234\n00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.725\nSo when we set something like this up.\n\n235\n00:12:33.725 --> 00:12:39.917\nRemember that it should be, of course,\nthat you've got your variable set\n\n236\n00:12:39.917 --> 00:12:45.470\nup to where you're gonna use\nyour credentials that you want.\n\n237\n00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.400\nSo if I go ahead and start.\n\n238\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.258\nSo let's just add this in here,\ncredential equals get.\n\n239\n00:12:52.258 --> 00:12:55.758\nNo I was just gonna say, why is that not.\n\n240\n00:12:55.758 --> 00:12:56.913\nYou wanna know something?\n\n241\n00:12:56.913 --> 00:12:59.675\nI forgot, at the very beginning,\n\n242\n00:12:59.675 --> 00:13:05.130\nI need a dollar sign to create\na variable and then get-credential.\n\n243\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.710\nNow its gonna add me or ask me for\nthe credentials I'm using.\n\n244\n00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.901\nofficeProDemoCo\n\n245\n00:13:16.981 --> 00:13:21.231\n.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n246\n00:13:21.231 --> 00:13:25.580\nAnd here I need to type in\nmy super secret password.\n\n247\n00:13:27.475 --> 00:13:28.520\nAnd we'll click OK.\n\n248\n00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.700\nHopefully, I've typed in\nmy password correctly.\n\n249\n00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.040\nIf not, it will balk at me at some point.\n\n250\n00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.350\nNow that I'm connected in there,\nI'm gonna also make sure\n\n251\n00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:43.872\nthat I am connected to\njust the Microsoft online.\n\n252\n00:13:43.872 --> 00:13:47.710\nI'm gonna import a module and\ndo MS online and\n\n253\n00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.256\nthat will verify that I am\nconnected to Microsoft online.\n\n254\n00:13:52.256 --> 00:13:56.599\nNow we'll\n\n255\n00:13:56.599 --> 00:14:02.040\nsee if I can create another variable here,\nand make sure.\n\n256\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.460\nSo I am just, and\nit looks like it did keep it, but\n\n257\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.520\nit's not showing me that right now.\n\n258\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.310\nSo I'm just making sure\nthat I'm connected back in.\n\n259\n00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.346\nGonna be Microsoft Exchange.\n\n260\n00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.256\nWe have to have where we're connecting to.\n\n261\n00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:30.210\nAnd then a URL, and\nthis should be Outlook.\n\n262\n00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:38.910\nDot office three sixty five dot\ncom forward slash power shell\n\n263\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.600\ndot live id and a forward slash here.\n\n264\n00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.876\nI need to provide those credentials.\n\n265\n00:14:47.876 --> 00:14:49.269\nRight there.\n\n266\n00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:56.662\nThen I need to tell it for authentication\nI want it to do some basic authentication.\n\n267\n00:14:56.662 --> 00:15:01.901\nAllow the redirection, so\nI'm just creating another variable.\n\n268\n00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:05.157\nAnd once that variable is created,\n\n269\n00:15:05.157 --> 00:15:10.920\nI now need to import a PowerShell\nsession based on that variable\n\n270\n00:15:15.454 --> 00:15:19.910\nSo Exchange session, tell it go and\ndisable the name-checking.\n\n271\n00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:27.730\nAnd this would just allow me to speed\nup the process here in just a moment.\n\n272\n00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.430\nAnd there we go, it's actually\nimporting everything in that I need to.\n\n273\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.550\nAnd make sure, and it does.\n\n274\n00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.740\nEven though I'm getting a little\nbit of red there, that's fine.\n\n275\n00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.764\nThe only thing I really care about is,\n\n276\n00:15:41.764 --> 00:15:47.215\noops, get PS session, there we go.\n\n277\n00:15:47.215 --> 00:15:48.335\nSo, there it is.\n\n278\n00:15:48.335 --> 00:15:51.185\nI have Exchange actually running,\nright here.\n\n279\n00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:52.465\nI've got two connections.\n\n280\n00:15:52.465 --> 00:15:53.484\nEverything's available.\n\n281\n00:15:53.484 --> 00:15:55.316\nI'm perfectly fine, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:55.316 --> 00:15:56.697\nSo just a couple of things, and\n\n283\n00:15:56.697 --> 00:15:59.849\nmore than likely it's just that I\ntyped in the wrong thing right away.\n\n284\n00:15:59.849 --> 00:16:03.415\nBut overall though, I just wanna\nmake sure that I am connected there.\n\n285\n00:16:03.415 --> 00:16:06.460\nNow, once I do that,\nlet's get back to retention tags now.\n\n286\n00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.940\nYou do have to make that happen.\n\n287\n00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.547\nEvery once in a while it will end\nup broken for one reason another,\n\n288\n00:16:11.547 --> 00:16:14.114\nlike Ronnie talks too long and\nends up broken.\n\n289\n00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:19.490\nBut once we actually get that,\nnow we're ready to start typing in.\n\n290\n00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.500\nThe idea of creating a new Retention Tag.\n\n291\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:28.550\nSo, for us, we're just going to\ntype in New Retention Policy.\n\n292\n00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.300\nBut, that's not the end of it.\n\n293\n00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.120\nNotice that it is a Policy Tag.\n\n294\n00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.020\nRemember that, even with that tab fill.\n\n295\n00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:35.860\nRight?\n\n296\n00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.160\nIt filled it Like if I\nget to this point and\n\n297\n00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.250\nthen I press, I might think that\nI'm ready to go, I may not be.\n\n298\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:48.220\nSo I need to make sure that I\ntype in New-RetentionPolicy Tag.\n\n299\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.710\nAnd now we're gonna give it a name.\n\n300\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:54.040\nAnd let's call this one Marketing Default.\n\n301\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:59.210\nSo let's say that this is a any marketing\npolicy or a tag that we're going to do.\n\n302\n00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.490\nSo any of my emails that I'm gonna have,\n\n303\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.940\nlet's say that I'm gonna end up putting\nthis in for marketing of some sort.\n\n304\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.477\nNow this is where I tell it what\ntype of tag this is gonna be.\n\n305\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.750\nNow on the type we're actually saying\nis this global, or is this for\n\n306\n00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.130\na specific site?\n\n307\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.630\nWhat is the central scope of this tag?\n\n308\n00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.240\nHow far reaching is it gonna be?\n\n309\n00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.789\nWell, I'm gonna say,\nI want to actually apply to everything.\n\n310\n00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:26.675\nIt's what I wanna do.\n\n311\n00:17:26.675 --> 00:17:29.591\nSo, -ALL,\n\n312\n00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:35.429\nthen RetentionEnabled.\n\n313\n00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:39.310\nAnd now,\nI need to set as dollar sign, true.\n\n314\n00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.870\nLet me zoom out so that we can see that.\n\n315\n00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.190\nZoom back in just a little bit so\nwe can see a little bit better.\n\n316\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.610\nRetention is true and provide an age\n\n317\n00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:56.699\nlimit for the retention and let's say\nthat I'm gonna set this to 270 days.\n\n318\n00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:02.722\nThen, along with this tag,\nI need to create a retention action.\n\n319\n00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.910\nAnd we'll have to zoom out a little bit.\n\n320\n00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.175\nOkay, retention action.\n\n321\n00:18:11.175 --> 00:18:12.997\nSay permanently delete.\n\n322\n00:18:14.905 --> 00:18:19.446\nPermanently delete is\n\n323\n00:18:19.446 --> 00:18:24.228\nwhat we are going to do.\n\n324\n00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:29.254\nAll right, so in just a moment I should\nsee where I have now created a new tag.\n\n325\n00:18:29.254 --> 00:18:32.815\nNow we are not really applying,\nI do not have a marketing team, but\n\n326\n00:18:32.815 --> 00:18:35.749\nyou can see now I have created\nthis particular policy.\n\n327\n00:18:35.749 --> 00:18:39.030\nAnd now let's check it out and verify.\n\n328\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.247\nThat the tag has now applied.\n\n329\n00:18:41.247 --> 00:18:47.508\nSo I'm just going to renew,\nrefresh, which I can't say.\n\n330\n00:18:47.508 --> 00:18:48.416\nThere it is.\n\n331\n00:18:48.416 --> 00:18:52.901\nAnd as the marketing default,\nI have created it for 270 days for\n\n332\n00:18:52.901 --> 00:18:56.760\nright now and notice I put it\nin the default here instead.\n\n333\n00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.660\nI could have created it as personal.\n\n334\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.360\nI could have made it delete items of\na particular folder if I wanted to.\n\n335\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.050\nSo this is the scope of what we're\ndoing is what we're actually saying.\n\n336\n00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.410\nNow, that's all fine and\n\n337\n00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.750\nthat's great because now I can use\nthat in any of the other policies.\n\n338\n00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:16.080\nIf I have a policy in place,\nI can use at any time that I want to.\n\n339\n00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.380\nBut what if we actually,\ndon't have the policy yet?\n\n340\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.390\nAnd I'm going, all right.\n\n341\n00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.230\nI created that particular tag, but\n\n342\n00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.540\nI now need to apply it to\na policy that's not created yet.\n\n343\n00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:32.220\nWell, you can in one power shell\ncommand line, if you want to.\n\n344\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.820\nTo be able to actually say\nI'm gonna make the policy and\n\n345\n00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.590\nalso create the tags\nwith it that we want to.\n\n346\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.220\nNow the problem that we have is\nfairly simple, if we do this, right?\n\n347\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.180\nOne, you have to actually have\nthose retention tags already there.\n\n348\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.850\nIf they're not there,\nit's gonna balk at you.\n\n349\n00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.900\nSo you have to be able to select\none of those if you do that.\n\n350\n00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.270\nSo now that I've got this one created,\nit should actually help us out.\n\n351\n00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.970\nTo do the next one.\n\n352\n00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:02.740\nSo let me do a new\nretention policy this time.\n\n353\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:09.241\nAnd we'll just call this\none our new tag policy.\n\n354\n00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:10.497\nRight here.\n\n355\n00:20:10.497 --> 00:20:16.260\nThen, I will do retention Policy.\n\n356\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.540\nTag links.\n\n357\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.580\nSo now I need to make sure\nthat I name this thing here.\n\n358\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.520\nMarketing, I probably should have\nchose something that was shorter so\n\n359\n00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.500\nI don't have to type as long.\n\n360\n00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.580\nAnd that's all it should be.\n\n361\n00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.950\nNow if I have multiple policies\nthat I wanted to apply to this\n\n362\n00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.430\nI now just put in a comma in-between them.\n\n363\n00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.760\nAnd then I list out the next one, okay.\n\n364\n00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.790\nBut for this one,\nlet's just do this one for\n\n365\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.750\nright now and hopefully see what happens.\n\n366\n00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.900\nIf I've typed anything wrong it's\ngonna let me know by bleeding all over\n\n367\n00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.660\nthe screen with a bunch of\nred writing at this point.\n\n368\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.610\nBut this will help us out here.\n\n369\n00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.220\nSo let's go ahead and see.\n\n370\n00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.490\nWhat ends up happening, and there we go.\n\n371\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:03.420\nWe now have created a new policy and\nnotice the tag that's put in right here.\n\n372\n00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.300\nLet's check this out, as well.\n\n373\n00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.960\nNow I have to go to the retention policy.\n\n374\n00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.110\nAnd in a moment we should see,\nthere it is.\n\n375\n00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.783\nThere is my new tag policy.\n\n376\n00:21:17.783 --> 00:21:23.085\nYou can see out of this and\nsee what retention's have been\n\n377\n00:21:23.085 --> 00:21:28.385\nput in place as far as the see\nhere trying to get to the point\n\n378\n00:21:28.385 --> 00:21:33.799\nwhere we can see that noticed\nthat without anything else so\n\n379\n00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:38.439\nI didn't actually define\nwhat the 270 days and\n\n380\n00:21:38.439 --> 00:21:42.350\nthe delete right here, right.\n\n381\n00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.620\nIt went ahead and said,\nhey when you created this and\n\n382\n00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:49.810\nyou assigned that new policy that\nyou created or that new tag.\n\n383\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:54.950\nNotice it took that and put it in, 270,\nand then the delete policy at the end.\n\n384\n00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.650\nIt merged those two things together for\nus.\n\n385\n00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.692\nAnd that's what we will also wanted to do.\n\n386\n00:21:59.692 --> 00:22:04.830\nAll right, so the great thing is,\nnow that we have both of those right?,\n\n387\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.000\nit is kind of like a jigsaw puzzles\nthat fitting together right?\n\n388\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.840\nWe have our retention tags that\nhelp us to define the criteria.\n\n389\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.720\nWe now, the policy that gives us that\nbasis to say, I now have this policy,\n\n390\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.330\nthat I need those tags\nthat could fit in to.\n\n391\n00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.100\nWe now need to make sure that we can\ngo ahead and say hey, look, here it is.\n\n392\n00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.650\nI now need to apply it to a mailbox,\nis what needs to happen, right.\n\n393\n00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.850\nSo how are we actually\ngonna end up applying this?\n\n394\n00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:35.030\nWell, from the Exchange admin center, and\nwe're really only gonna do this here.\n\n395\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:40.440\nBecause, it's fairly easy at\nthis point for us to apply this.\n\n396\n00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.610\nSo, let's go now into our recipients here.\n\n397\n00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:50.060\nAnd then, we'll select Lance cuz I've\nbeen using Lance for our testing for\n\n398\n00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.140\na good long time now.\n\n399\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:51.760\n&gt;&gt; He's a good man.\n\n400\n00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.239\n&gt;&gt; So, yep, we're gonna choose Lance.\n\n401\n00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.790\nI'm just gonna double click on his\nname which is equivalent as me using\n\n402\n00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.650\nthe edit or the pencil.\n\n403\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:04.905\nOnce I've selected Lance and\nI've now edited\n\n404\n00:23:04.905 --> 00:23:09.762\nI am not going to select mailbox features.\n\n405\n00:23:13.887 --> 00:23:15.740\nAll right, well, let's see.\n\n406\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.020\nApparently, I can't use, there, okay.\n\n407\n00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.770\nIt was warning me about them\nlike you haven't logged in.\n\n408\n00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.630\nThat's fine, we're not so\nworried about that.\n\n409\n00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.400\nSo it actually still let me get here.\n\n410\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.970\nThat's what I wanted to do.\n\n411\n00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.560\nNotice that the current policy that's\nactually been assigned as well, 100 days.\n\n412\n00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.510\nThat's not the one that I want, the one\nthat I want is the new tag policy, and\n\n413\n00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.160\nthere we go.\n\n414\n00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.010\nFairly easy, I select save and\n\n415\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:44.980\nnow we've assigned really just Lance\nwith that one retention policy.\n\n416\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.114\nSo we can actually do this if we want to,\nlimit just Lance and\n\n417\n00:23:48.114 --> 00:23:51.627\nthat way Lance has his own personal\nretention policy in the way that\n\n418\n00:23:51.627 --> 00:23:53.908\nwe’ve set it up, Lance can't change it.\n\n419\n00:23:53.908 --> 00:23:56.696\nThat may be good for\nwhat I want it to do as well.\n\n420\n00:23:56.696 --> 00:24:01.678\n&gt;&gt; Let's just say I need to\napply this to a few people.\n\n421\n00:24:01.678 --> 00:24:03.506\nHow do I do that or can I do that too?\n\n422\n00:24:03.506 --> 00:24:04.101\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n423\n00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:07.761\nYeah, sometimes, remember as we\nstarted talking about policy idea,\n\n424\n00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:11.116\nwe can apply it globally or\nwe can apply it to a group of people, and\n\n425\n00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:14.850\nwe've showed you that you can\napply it to individuals, too.\n\n426\n00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.690\nBut what if it doesn't really fit\nlike an entire group like marketing?\n\n427\n00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.920\nAnd then really fit our\nentire organization.\n\n428\n00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:27.120\nIs there a way for me to just apply it to\njust a few people if I choose to do that?\n\n429\n00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.710\nIn other words, cherry pick the people\nthat I want it to be able to do.\n\n430\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.180\nWell, let me see if I can\nactually cherry pick here.\n\n431\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.700\nOops, let me not do it that way.\n\n432\n00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.400\nLet me try and select one,\nand let's see here.\n\n433\n00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:44.710\nHow do I actually select multiple people\nis what I want to be able to do is here.\n\n434\n00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:52.060\nSo, from this point I need to select and\nbe able to see this.\n\n435\n00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.430\nLet's see here, how do I select,\nlet me just do everyone for\n\n436\n00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.610\nright now, so apparently I can\ndo like this here, there we go.\n\n437\n00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.080\nI was hoping I could pick like Joey and\n\n438\n00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.160\nthen Lance but that way I could show,\nbut let me do just these two.\n\n439\n00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.730\nLet's do Justin and Lance.\n\n440\n00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:13.630\nAll right, so now that I've selected these\ntwo, what's kind of worried me is that I\n\n441\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.670\nneed to edit this so that I can go and\nfind that retention policy.\n\n442\n00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:21.200\nThe problem that I have, though, is notice\nthat I have the pencil has disappeared.\n\n443\n00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.720\nSo I'm a little bit\ndisconcerted except for\n\n444\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.880\nthe very fact that if I take a look\nover here on the right hand side\n\n445\n00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.180\nZack notice what it says right there,\nwhere it says bulk edit.\n\n446\n00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:36.880\nSo apply these changes to\nthe two selected recipients.\n\n447\n00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:43.390\nIf I scroll down, all the way to\nthe bottom, and I select more options.\n\n448\n00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:44.949\nWell, hopefully I've\nselected more options.\n\n449\n00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.070\nNotice that,\n\n450\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:53.500\nas it's updating right now, you can\nsee where it says Retention Policy.\n\n451\n00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.730\nRight here.\n\n452\n00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.660\nI click Update.\n\n453\n00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.800\nAnd now, for both of those users,\nI can now choose and\n\n454\n00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.280\nselect what policy I want to apply.\n\n455\n00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.350\nSo this is where you do\nhave that chance and\n\n456\n00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.110\nyou do have to kinda be\na little that careful,\n\n457\n00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.840\nI wasn't able to kind of just, what I\nwanted to do was pick Joey and Lance,\n\n458\n00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.540\nI thought I could do that where I could\nhold my Ctrl key down and select Joey.\n\n459\n00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.580\nAnd then hold the Ctrl key down and\nselect Lance and\n\n460\n00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.840\nthat should allow me to pick that, but\n\n461\n00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:28.670\non my machine, It currently isn't\nworking what we have and I select save.\n\n462\n00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.140\nOnce I do that,\nthat should now apply to both of them.\n\n463\n00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.750\nSo this is how you can do that,\nyou can limit it to just a few\n\n464\n00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.570\nif you want just instead of the entire\ngroup that you might created here.\n\n465\n00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:43.710\nSo, it gives you that policy and that\nability to create retention attack and\n\n466\n00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.660\nto apply pretty much to\nwho what you want to.\n\n467\n00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:51.000\n&gt;&gt; Is there any gotcha associated\nwith the user accessing the mailbox?\n\n468\n00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nto a point when we get to this point.\n\n469\n00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:57.080\nThere are a few things and actually I'm\nglad you reminded me of this, Zach.\n\n470\n00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.630\nThat the idea of the personal archive,\nright.\n\n471\n00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.270\nIt's not gonna show up for everybody.\n\n472\n00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.810\nAnd that's something I do need\nto remind everybody of, right.\n\n473\n00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:08.230\nIf you already have an enterprise account,\nmore than likely,\n\n474\n00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:13.350\nyou'll be able to see it, as long as you\nhave an E3 subscription in the Office 365.\n\n475\n00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:19.330\nOr if you're actually running the Office\n365 ProPlus Edition on your computers,\n\n476\n00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:23.510\nyou're also gonna be able to access this\nas well now, there's only a couple of\n\n477\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.270\nother ones that are standalone\nthat will allow you to do this.\n\n478\n00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.410\nNot, Office, Outlook 2016 standalone.\n\n479\n00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:33.639\nSo, if you went out and you purchased\nthat one, then they can also access\n\n480\n00:27:33.639 --> 00:27:38.382\nthe archive mailboxes that are setup,\nas well Office 2013.\n\n481\n00:27:38.382 --> 00:27:43.430\nBut if you have any of the other editions,\nit's not gonna be available to you.\n\n482\n00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.640\nSo just remember that, that those\npolicies, they are gonna be applied but\n\n483\n00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.690\nyou do have to have what they\ncall in the industry, right,\n\n484\n00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.870\nthe proper SKU to make that happen.\n\n485\n00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:56.620\nBut overall though, that's kind of\nthe very last gotcha, when people go,\n\n486\n00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:01.330\nI know that the archive\npolicies are turned on.\n\n487\n00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:06.510\nBut I'm running, let's say,\nOffice or Outlook 2010.\n\n488\n00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:11.050\nI don't see the archive mailbox there for\nme to access.\n\n489\n00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:14.970\nWell, one of the things that may actually\nget you is that, you realize something.\n\n490\n00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:15.920\nYeah, that's right.\n\n491\n00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.190\nHe has to actually be on these\nproducts that I mentioned, right?\n\n492\n00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:22.500\nEither the E3, or\nyou're running Office Pro Plus.\n\n493\n00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.359\nThe Office 365 E3 or the Office Pro Plus.\n\n494\n00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:34.120\nOffice 365, Pro Plus, or\nthe Outlook 2016 2013 standalone editions.\n\n495\n00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.540\n2010 is not gonna cut it.\n\n496\n00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.670\nAnything earlier is not gonna cut it.\n\n497\n00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.640\nSo just remember that.\n\n498\n00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.630\nIt does have to actually match\nup with what I've said here,\n\n499\n00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:46.390\nor you're gonna see that archive\nis not gonna be available to you\n\n500\n00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.380\nat least in the way that\nI've showed you here.\n\n501\n00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.610\nSo that should round out just about\neverything that we need to know\n\n502\n00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:53.960\nabout enabling the personal\narchive policies.\n\n503\n00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.580\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, thank you for helping us to\nconfigure personal archive polices.\n\n504\n00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.560\nAs we continue with enabling\nOffice 365 services.\n\n505\n00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.370\nAnd thank you for\njoining us here on ITPro.TV.\n\n506\n00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.430\nI'm Zack Memes.\n\n507\n00:29:05.430 -->

00:00:08.092\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:11.732\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.732 --> 00:00:13.797\n&gt;&gt; Hello and once again thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.902\nmaking the intelligent\nchoice to watch ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:22.151\nI'm your host Zach Memis for\nenabling Office 365 services.\n\n8\n00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:26.890\nAnd this time we're gonna be configuring\nSkype and user settings with Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.010\nHey Ronnie how you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.830\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.871\nThank you again for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:32.870\n&gt;&gt; Let's navigate through these waters.\n\n13\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.580\n&gt;&gt; As we start taking look at the idea\nof using Skype whether you've been in\n\n14\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.150\na business setting before or even at home\nyou've probably used Skype at some point.\n\n15\n00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.880\nSo you understand that there's\na lot of power behind Skype.\n\n16\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.070\nAs for individuals, I know of a friend\nof mine who uses it every day so\n\n17\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.986\nthat she can actually help\nher daughter babysit her\n\n18\n00:00:55.986 --> 00:01:00.741\ngrandchildren while mom gets\nbreakfast ready or something.\n\n19\n00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:03.250\nShe's sitting there with her\ngrandchildren being able to do that.\n\n20\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.770\nAnd that's because it's a very powerful,\n\n21\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.420\nvery easy relatively intuitive type\nof system that somebody can use for\n\n22\n00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.200\nnot only teleconferencing but\nthere's a lot more that goes behind this.\n\n23\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.030\nWhen we come to Skype for\nBusiness its power is immense.\n\n24\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.760\nAnd its ability for us to actually\nhave great communication it is,\n\n25\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.540\nit's really a neat thing.\n\n26\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.890\nYou can not only have the idea of\nthe audio as well as the visual if\n\n27\n00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.950\nyou want to.\n\n28\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.020\nThe video kinda two way\nthing that we have.\n\n29\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.632\nWe of course can get meetings done.\n\n30\n00:01:36.632 --> 00:01:40.966\nWe can also have phone calls if we get\nSkype for business with the PST on\n\n31\n00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:45.990\nthe Publicly Switched Telephone Network\nand all that enabled as well.\n\n32\n00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.400\nWe can have contacts be listed there too.\n\n33\n00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.410\nAs well as do instant\nmessaging types of chat.\n\n34\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.990\nYou name it this becomes\na very powerful system for\n\n35\n00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.870\na company to use for\nincredible amounts of communication.\n\n36\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.340\nAnd along with that of course is a lot\nof data that goes across it as well.\n\n37\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.300\nSo that's why we're taking\na little bit of time here\n\n38\n00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.580\ntalking about of course the configuration\nhere, of these end user types of settings.\n\n39\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.630\nNow when we do this we need to begin okay,\nfrom a little bit more of an unusual\n\n40\n00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.130\nstandpoint which most of us don't think\nabout which is the idea of compliance.\n\n41\n00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.180\nThe very fact that when we're at home and\n\n42\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.560\nwe're doing this we definitely\nneed to be careful.\n\n43\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.590\nWe don't know how much information is\ngoing out across the Skype network.\n\n44\n00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.850\nWe really don't.\n\n45\n00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.620\nBut in a business though, because\nyou're handling other people's data and\n\n46\n00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.820\nvery sensitive data personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n47\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.950\nYou need to careful about some of\nthe settings that are in there,\n\n48\n00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.230\nthat are built in,\nthat you may not know about.\n\n49\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.060\nAnd one of those things that\ncompanies always have to deal with\n\n50\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.080\nis the idea of compliance is\nwhat we have to deal with.\n\n51\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.449\nSo when Skype for\nbusiness is now integrated into your\n\n52\n00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.245\nbusiness you need to take\na little bit of time.\n\n53\n00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:07.496\nAnd understand that we need to also\nmake sure that if we're gonna use\n\n54\n00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:12.400\nthis that we may need to configure it for\ncompliance measures like that.\n\n55\n00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.680\nAnd that's what we want\nto make sure of it.\n\n56\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.970\nSo let's go ahead and jump right in and\n\n57\n00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.950\nI wanna show you where this is actually\nset up right at the beginning.\n\n58\n00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.760\nAnd then we'll kind of talk about it\na little bit more as we get started.\n\n59\n00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.990\nSo right here on my computer screen\nI am in the office 365 admin center.\n\n60\n00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.720\nWell the Skype for\nBusiness has its own admin center as well.\n\n61\n00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.690\nSo over on the left hand side I'm gonna\nscroll down to the little admin center\n\n62\n00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.250\nicon down here.\n\n63\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.360\nThen inside of the admin center icon\nI'm going to select the Skype for\n\n64\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.020\nBusiness link.\n\n65\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.130\nWhen I do that it should take me to\nthe webpage here, and it's asking me for\n\n66\n00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.020\ncredentials.\n\n67\n00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.080\nAnd today it's actually been\ndoing this quite often.\n\n68\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.120\nUsually it just takes me there but\n\n69\n00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.380\ntoday it's having me to sign\nin like crazy all the time.\n\n70\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.571\nHopefully in just a moment I should get\nto the Skype for Business Admin Center.\n\n71\n00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:08.362\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Just wants to make sure\n\n72\n00:04:08.362 --> 00:04:08.989\nit's you Ronnie.\n\n73\n00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm assuming that's what's happening but\n\n74\n00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:16.210\nit is actually taking a sweet little\nbit of time in switching over.\n\n75\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:21.238\nSo there must be some type of\nauthentication backend issue that's\n\n76\n00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:27.180\nhappening cuz it's really making us\nwait before we can get logged in.\n\n77\n00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.140\nAlright, so there it went to finally\nactually did load up the Skype for\n\n78\n00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.950\nBusiness admin center.\n\n79\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.190\nWhen we start taking a look at the\ncompliance here I'm going to select over\n\n80\n00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.250\non the left hand side where it says users.\n\n81\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.812\nAnd once the users' here\nI'm gonna select Lance,\n\n82\n00:04:41.812 --> 00:04:44.080\nhe's kinda my favorite\nguinea pig at this point.\n\n83\n00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.649\n&gt;&gt; And here Lance.\n\n84\n00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:46.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt.\n\n85\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.020\nThere's other ones that we have\navailable let's go ahead and\n\n86\n00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.340\nselect Lance at this point for\nour guinea pig.\n\n87\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.890\nDouble click on his name.\n\n88\n00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.700\nThat should lead me of course to his\nparticular page and what we want.\n\n89\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.780\nNotice that this is all about Lance here,\ngeneral,\n\n90\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.530\nexternal communications and dial in.\n\n91\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.125\nAnd there really isn't a ton of\nsettings for each user, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:10.160\nBut there are actually settings\nthat we have to pay attention to.\n\n93\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.690\nAnd on this one it is the one for\ncompliance that we need.\n\n94\n00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.060\nNow when you start to take a look\nit's relatively easy at this point,\n\n95\n00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.130\nright, when we start to look at here.\n\n96\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.400\nSo select the Skype for Business feature\nthat you would like this user to have.\n\n97\n00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.570\nWell the great thing is we understand\nthis audio and HD video here.\n\n98\n00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.040\nRecord conversations and\nmeetings that seemed normal.\n\n99\n00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.200\nBut notice this one by default even\nin Business is actually not checked.\n\n100\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.298\nSo it says for\ncompliance turn off non-archived\n\n101\n00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:50.990\nfeatures is what this one actually says.\n\n102\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.390\nSo if I wanted to enable\nthis it looks fairly simple.\n\n103\n00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.900\nAll I have to do is this.\n\n104\n00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.790\nAnd we are pretty much ready to go.\n\n105\n00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.460\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie,\nwhy would we need to do this?\n\n106\n00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.748\nDoesn't it seem a little confusing to\nturn off something to be compliant?\n\n107\n00:06:03.748 --> 00:06:07.980\n&gt;&gt; It is, right, and this is\nsomething that confused me the first\n\n108\n00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.580\ntime when I was kind of thinking\nwhat does this actually mean?\n\n109\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.120\nTurn off something to meet compliance?\n\n110\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.570\nDoes it mean Zack that something\nis on that isn't in compliance\n\n111\n00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.500\nby default it's not in compliance?\n\n112\n00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.810\nThat would be weird, right?\n\n113\n00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.259\nThey're integrating this into\nan enterprise level type of structure and\n\n114\n00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:31.416\ninfrastructure.\n\n115\n00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:36.436\nAnd there may be some things that\nreally aren't in compliance there and\n\n116\n00:06:36.436 --> 00:06:41.100\nyou're like should I be using\nthat if that's the default?\n\n117\n00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.400\nThat it's really not in compliance.\n\n118\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.150\nWell, the problem is fairly simple.\n\n119\n00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.450\nI'm over thinking is at\nas what I'm doing and\n\n120\n00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.980\nthat's what ends up happening\na lot of times, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.680\nA lot of our compliance issues really have\nto do with the very fact that inside of\n\n122\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.000\nmost companies we are normally legally\nrequired to keep electronically stored\n\n123\n00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.260\ninformation in whatever the industry\nsays or whatever the regulation says.\n\n124\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.990\nNow the great thing is\ninside of Office 365 and\n\n125\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.690\nthe Cloud, you can keep information for\nas long as you want to.\n\n126\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.745\nAnd as long as you're willing to pay for\nthe storage you can keep it forever and\n\n127\n00:07:14.745 --> 00:07:15.741\never, and ever, okay.\n\n128\n00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:18.891\nThat's not the issue and\nthe problem now, okay.\n\n129\n00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:21.067\nThe issue though happens to be,\n\n130\n00:07:21.067 --> 00:07:26.160\nhow do we retrieve that information\nlegally when we need to, okay.\n\n131\n00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.760\nSo here is something that you and\nI may not understand yet.\n\n132\n00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.090\nIs that with Skype for Business,\n\n133\n00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.690\nthere are certain features\nthat are built in to it, okay.\n\n134\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.270\nFor example, there is what we call,\nof course file transfer and\n\n135\n00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.910\nInstant Messaging that is\nactually on by default.\n\n136\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.775\nIt's a part of the way that\nit function by default, okay.\n\n137\n00:07:46.775 --> 00:07:51.378\nThere's also what we call Shared Onenote\npages that we can also use\n\n138\n00:07:51.378 --> 00:07:53.852\nacross Skype for Business as well.\n\n139\n00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:58.448\nAnd even Powerpoint annotations that\nare actually within, well Powerpoint,\n\n140\n00:07:58.448 --> 00:08:01.545\nbut somehow Skype can also\nget access to them as well.\n\n141\n00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:06.406\nWell what we need to do then is\nmake sure that Skype doesn't use\n\n142\n00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:08.936\nany of those features.\n\n143\n00:08:08.936 --> 00:08:12.300\nNow, if they are on by default, the way\nthat we meet compliance is simple, we go,\n\n144\n00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.940\nall right, if we are gonna be using\nSkype throughout my organization and\n\n145\n00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.980\nI know I'm going to have to\nhave some kind of legal hold\n\n146\n00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.090\non any communication that\ngoes across even Skype for\n\n147\n00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:28.850\nBusiness as well as SharePoint as well\nas Exchange and others, my email system.\n\n148\n00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:34.280\nIf I have to go and look for\nevery single mention of Zach's name in\n\n149\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.760\nmy organization on every\npice of communication and\n\n150\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.420\nif something happens to be\nin a PowerPoint annotation.\n\n151\n00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.377\nIt can't find it.\n\n152\n00:08:41.377 --> 00:08:45.584\nSo the product that's actually available\nfor that eDiscovery, it doesn't look in\n\n153\n00:08:45.584 --> 00:08:49.560\nthose things, okay, it doesn't look\ninto the shared OneNote pages.\n\n154\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.370\nIt doesn't look into\nthe file transfer inside of\n\n155\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.960\nthe instant messaging system that's here,\nokay?\n\n156\n00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.850\nSo, what we are saying is,\nif we're gonna use this and\n\n157\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.720\nI know that I'm gonna be using eDiscovery,\nI need to turn that feature off.\n\n158\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.030\nSo, that's why this is confusing, because\nmost of us go, if we implement compliance,\n\n159\n00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.470\nwe're turning something on, right?\n\n160\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.189\nWe're essentially saying lock the doors,\nmake sure everything is following this.\n\n161\n00:09:12.189 --> 00:09:13.840\nEnable this process.\n\n162\n00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.610\nAnd here I'm saying, no,\n\n163\n00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.580\nthese are features that are built\ninto the way that Skype works.\n\n164\n00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.490\nSo, we need to disable those that we won't\nbe able to find that information in.\n\n165\n00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.810\nSo, I know it is just one of those things,\nthat it sounds\n\n166\n00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:33.220\nit really does sound counter intuitive\nto everything that we're used to doing.\n\n167\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.140\nMost of us don't think,\nyeah if we just turn that off,\n\n168\n00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.700\nwe'll just be in compliance.\n\n169\n00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.730\nBut that's it, it's a simple check mark.\n\n170\n00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:44.290\nIt seems to make it actually work\nwhen we don't do anything like this.\n\n171\n00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.680\nSo that's pretty much it.\n\n172\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.250\nSo from the web UI, you can see\nthat if I were to do this, Zack,\n\n173\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.860\nany day of the week for my organization,\nthis is where I would go to do it, right?\n\n174\n00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.300\nIt's a check mark.\n\n175\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.820\nI don't have to actually think\nabout writing a code for it.\n\n176\n00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:05.210\nI'd have to think about looking up\na PowerShell script for it, to try and\n\n177\n00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.830\nfigure out if I've,\nif I really only have to.\n\n178\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.030\nThis is one of those features that,\nthat for\n\n179\n00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:14.720\nus it's as close as we get to set it,\nand forget it, right?\n\n180\n00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.507\nCuz what are the chances that\none day I'm gonna choose for\n\n181\n00:10:17.507 --> 00:10:19.550\nmy organization not to be in compliance.\n\n182\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.600\nRare, it's probably not gonna happen.\n\n183\n00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.930\nSo if there were anything that\nwould be a permanent setting for\n\n184\n00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:31.020\nme after I put it in place,it's\ngonna be this idea right here.\n\n185\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.605\nSo why would I ever choose not to do that?\n\n186\n00:10:33.605 --> 00:10:37.860\nThere's probably not a time I\nwould ever choose not to do that.\n\n187\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.720\nSo what you don't understand is,\n\n188\n00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.190\nwhy then didn't they just disable\nthose features from the beginning.\n\n189\n00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:49.032\nWell, it's because they wanna give you,\nas an organization the freedom, and\n\n190\n00:10:49.032 --> 00:10:52.878\nthat ability to say my organization,\nI don't worry about it.\n\n191\n00:10:52.878 --> 00:10:56.230\nIf I'm not gonna worry about it,\nthen it doesn't matter.\n\n192\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.760\nSo I'm not gonna worry\nabout keeping all this.\n\n193\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.810\nBut if you're handling\nother people's information,\n\n194\n00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.480\nmore than likely this is gonna be\na default for you as a no-brainer.\n\n195\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.840\nIt's not a big decision\nthat you have to do.\n\n196\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.650\nIt's just something you're\ngonna do automatically.\n\n197\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.020\nBut like everything else that we're\nalso preparing for, it's not only in\n\n198\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.700\nthe reality of getting everything set\nup but it's also for the exam, which of\n\n199\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:23.280\ncourse means you do have to understand how\nto do this inside of PowerShell as well.\n\n200\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.980\nAnd this one is not as intuitive.\n\n201\n00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.030\nThere is not one that is just like,\nall right, here you go.\n\n202\n00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.370\nThis makes sense.\n\n203\n00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.510\nSome of the steps that we looked at,\nit does make sense, talking through it.\n\n204\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.340\nIt makes sense.\n\n205\n00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.620\nIt sounds like it.\n\n206\n00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.200\nBut on this one, you're gonna found\nout it doesn't really makes sense.\n\n207\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.240\nThat's because it kind of a hobble\nthings together for the Skype for\n\n208\n00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.620\nBusiness PowerShell.\n\n209\n00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.860\nEverything that to do the way\nthat they wanted it to work.\n\n210\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:53.950\nSo that means, we've got to kind of dive\nin to the end that's really not as pretty,\n\n211\n00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.060\nnot as easy to do this.\n\n212\n00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.230\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that setting.\n\n213\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.640\nSo I'm not gonna set this right now,\nthat way we can actually leave this page.\n\n214\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.310\nI shouldn't have left that page,\nbut that'll work.\n\n215\n00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.440\nSo okay, it's coming back, it was one\nof those things where it was like,\n\n216\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.950\nit's gonna ask me to authenticate again.\n\n217\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.090\nIt's gonna take 15 minutes for\nme to do that.\n\n218\n00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.080\nBut it's coming back, and that's fine.\n\n219\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.950\nI'm going to get connected\nback into my PowerShell, and\n\n220\n00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.980\nnow we're ready to take a look at\nthe way that PowerShell is set up.\n\n221\n00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.080\nI warned everybody right now\nthat what you're gonna see\n\n222\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.550\nhere is not anything that's intuitive.\n\n223\n00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.270\nAll the other things that we've been\ntaking a look at in the past, it really\n\n224\n00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.540\nhas where everything feels polished, it\nfeels completed, it feels sophisticated,\n\n225\n00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.600\nbut this one it kinda really seems\nlike it is just put together.\n\n226\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.010\nSo we're working on a product\ncalled Skype for Business.\n\n227\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.830\nSo as we begin, you'd think,\nokay, we all get like Skype for\n\n228\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.010\nBusiness settings or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n229\n00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:54.750\nSo if I start this,\nthe command that I need here is I try and\n\n230\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.770\nscroll in a little bit to get us.\n\n231\n00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.640\nThere we go.\n\n232\n00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.200\nOkay?\n\n233\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.285\nSo what I need to type in is\n\n234\n00:13:02.285 --> 00:13:07.600\nGet-CsConferencingPolicy.\n\n235\n00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.650\nWhat is CS?\n\n236\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.480\nHow does that relate to Skype for\nBusiness?\n\n237\n00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.120\nYeah, exactly.\n\n238\n00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.150\nNow I'm a bit more confused\nas I try to do this.\n\n239\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.590\nSo there's nothing intuitive\nwhen we get to this point.\n\n240\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.340\nI can also set in an identity.\n\n241\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.490\nAnd I don't even need to do that.\n\n242\n00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.540\nLet me just run this right now,\n\n243\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.760\nbefore I kind of get a little bit\nmore specific in what I want to do.\n\n244\n00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.660\nNow if I do this,\n\n245\n00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:34.710\nit's gonna show me every single policy\nthat is available to Skype for Business.\n\n246\n00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.900\nNow, you watch this Zack,\n\n247\n00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.570\nyou'll see that there's a few\npolicies here as we take a look.\n\n248\n00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.850\nSo I've just pressed it down there.\n\n249\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.880\nAnd now, as I scroll through,\nit happens so fast.\n\n250\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.780\nLet me try and just scroll Zack,\nand you'll notice something.\n\n251\n00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.280\nI can keep scrolling up.\n\n252\n00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.990\nIt was so fast and\n\n253\n00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.780\nhow that she just kind of set that policy,\nZack it's not ending, okay.\n\n254\n00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.230\nThere is a ton and for those of you\nthat are actually taking a look,\n\n255\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:06.210\nit's about half way down on my scroll bar\nright over here on the right hand side,\n\n256\n00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.150\nis what it zoomed down to.\n\n257\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:13.720\nSo if I scroll all the way back up\nto where I type in this policy,\n\n258\n00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.140\nthat's a lot of policies.\n\n259\n00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:20.910\nEach one begins with this idea of\nan identity, is what it begins with.\n\n260\n00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.460\nAnd now as you scroll through,\n\n261\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.230\nyou can see that there's some\nother ones that are here too.\n\n262\n00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:30.510\nSo here are some other types\nof policies that we see.\n\n263\n00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.040\nSo there's a ton of policies.\n\n264\n00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.230\nNow, the one that we're interested\nin which is a kind of default for\n\n265\n00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.820\nSkype for Business here,\nI'm going to hit my up arrow so\n\n266\n00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:48.860\nthat I can get the last command that\nI typed in, and type in identity.\n\n267\n00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.655\nNow, this is gonna be much more intuitive.\n\n268\n00:14:50.655 --> 00:14:54.271\nZack, I'm not gonna promise\nyou that I'm actually being\n\n269\n00:14:54.271 --> 00:14:57.410\nabout this [LAUGH] is what I'm\ngonna do here, okay [LAUGH].\n\n270\n00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:07.420\nBposSALLmodality.\n\n271\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.385\nNow even just guessing Bpos\n\n272\n00:15:11.385 --> 00:15:17.460\ndon't have or Bpos and\na capital S at the end.\n\n273\n00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.090\nI don't really know.\n\n274\n00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.800\nAllModality.\n\n275\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.880\nI can figure out what all means, modality,\nI have a good shot but the rest of this?\n\n276\n00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.910\nSo when you take a look at this, right?\n\n277\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.700\nThis is something that,\nif you're getting ready for\n\n278\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.190\nthe exam, there is no memory hook or\nassociation that clearly jumps out and\n\n279\n00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.040\nsays, yes,\nthis is related to Skype for Business.\n\n280\n00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.680\nYeah, there's nothing\nabout this particular\n\n281\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.840\nline that would jump right out to me,\nBill.\n\n282\n00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.990\nYes, that's a Skype for Business\nPowerShell command that we would have.\n\n283\n00:15:47.328 --> 00:15:49.929\nSo I'm gonna select that one, and\n\n284\n00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:54.872\nnow we're just filtering it down\nto that one policy here, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:54.872 --> 00:16:00.371\nNow, because of what I said,\nthe real issue here is compliance, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:00.371 --> 00:16:04.766\nSo even though it affects all of these\nother things that we see We're really\n\n287\n00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:08.546\nlooking at four different things\nthat we've got to talk about.\n\n288\n00:16:08.546 --> 00:16:11.188\nAnd I already mentioned them\nin a different way, but\n\n289\n00:16:11.188 --> 00:16:15.305\nyou need to know about them right here, in\nthe way that this shows up in this list.\n\n290\n00:16:15.305 --> 00:16:19.860\nAnd like anything else, you would think\nthat somewhere at Microsoft there was a,\n\n291\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.620\nputting everything in\nalphabetical order would be good.\n\n292\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.850\nBut it's not all in alphabetical order,\nevery once in a while as I jump down here\n\n293\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.045\nyou end up seeing where there's Es and\nthen As start over again at some point.\n\n294\n00:16:31.045 --> 00:16:36.770\nUnderneath video here, this is app\nsharing bit rate, so even that, it makes\n\n295\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:41.620\nit difficult for you to kind of really\nlook for what you want to actually see.\n\n296\n00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.966\nSo a couple of them that we're\nreally looking for here,\n\n297\n00:16:45.966 --> 00:16:49.300\nis one is this one, AllowedSharedNotes.\n\n298\n00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.792\nNotice that this one is True,\nokay, so right now,\n\n299\n00:16:52.792 --> 00:16:55.565\nthis is not in compliance at this point.\n\n300\n00:16:55.565 --> 00:16:59.731\nThe other one is enable\nthe File share Transfer or\n\n301\n00:16:59.731 --> 00:17:04.350\nthe FileTransfer,\nthis one is also set to on.\n\n302\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:09.755\nAnd then we also have EnableP2P,\nor person-to-person,\n\n303\n00:17:09.755 --> 00:17:15.920\npoint-to-point, file share, and\nnotice that that one is also set as True.\n\n304\n00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.050\nAnd then we have one more that\nwe're looking for which is D,\n\n305\n00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:24.690\nDisablePowerPointAnnotations.\n\n306\n00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:29.720\nNow that one is set to False,\nokay, so we have kind of\n\n307\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.290\nwhat we were talking about, where earlier\nI was telling you about the file transfer.\n\n308\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.240\nThis is something that something like,\ne-discovery, can't search through, same\n\n309\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.770\nthing with the shared OneNote pages, same\nthing with the PowerPoint annotations.\n\n310\n00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.320\nThey can't search through it,\nso if three of them are true,\n\n311\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.720\none of them is false, well that's\nan issue in terms of compliance.\n\n312\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.870\nSo that means I need to go in and\nI need to be able to have then, a command\n\n313\n00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.500\nthat actually allows me to go ahead and\nset this up a little bit differently.\n\n314\n00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.650\nIn Skype for Business online,\nit is unusual, okay,\n\n315\n00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:12.290\nyou do not get to create a custom\npolicy with Skype for Business online.\n\n316\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.610\nAnd that is where it become\na little bit more harsh.\n\n317\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.620\nBecause when you start doing this, right,\nit plays around with stuff a little bit\n\n318\n00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.370\nmore than you want it to, and\nthat's what they don't want to happen.\n\n319\n00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.470\nSo a lot of these setting,\n\n320\n00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.880\nif you happen to mess them up in\nthe customization, it really is bad.\n\n321\n00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.390\nThat's what the team is\ntrying to tell you, so\n\n322\n00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.560\nif you have actually been\non editions of Skype for\n\n323\n00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:41.080\nBusiness previous to the one that we're\nusing now, in Office 365 currently.\n\n324\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.591\nWhich would be before the Skype for\nBusiness 2015 model,\n\n325\n00:18:44.591 --> 00:18:47.029\nthey do allow for customizations on this.\n\n326\n00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:51.898\nBut on this one,\nyou really don't actually do much here, so\n\n327\n00:18:51.898 --> 00:18:56.767\nlet's change up this Get Conferencing\npolicy a little bit,\n\n328\n00:18:56.767 --> 00:19:01.156\nand show you the other one that\nis actually a built in for\n\n329\n00:19:01.156 --> 00:19:06.230\nus which is No, FT, okay.\n\n330\n00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.340\nSo now as I scroll in here,\nnotice that this one it says,\n\n331\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.170\nget the conferencing policy, and\nhere is that default policy right here.\n\n332\n00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:22.329\nBut this time it ends in NoFT, wow, that\nmakes it so much more clear, doesn't it?\n\n333\n00:19:24.263 --> 00:19:26.968\nSomething like that,\nit actually stands for\n\n334\n00:19:26.968 --> 00:19:30.038\nno file transfer is what\nthat actually stands for.\n\n335\n00:19:30.038 --> 00:19:34.888\nNow here if I press enter at this point,\nnow let me zoom out so\n\n336\n00:19:34.888 --> 00:19:36.935\nthat we can see this one.\n\n337\n00:19:38.486 --> 00:19:40.710\nSo there it is.\n\n338\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.136\nHere is the tag with the NoFT\nhere at the very end,\n\n339\n00:19:44.136 --> 00:19:46.567\nthat's how you can also see this.\n\n340\n00:19:46.567 --> 00:19:48.880\nNow if we go back through and\nlook for this,\n\n341\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.597\nthis is still gonna be\nFalse which is fine, okay.\n\n342\n00:19:51.597 --> 00:19:55.776\nThe other one is AllowAnnotations,\nthat one's still set to True so\n\n343\n00:19:55.776 --> 00:19:57.940\nwe gotta kinda be careful there.\n\n344\n00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.180\nThat's something that we can modify\nat least one of them if we do this,\n\n345\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.130\nthe other one that we're also looking for\nwas the enable.\n\n346\n00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.700\nSo if I scroll down a little bit here,\nEnablFileTransfer, and\n\n347\n00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.530\nthe one right underneath it,\nthose two have been turned to False.\n\n348\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:18.310\nSo by doing something like this\nit at least gets those changed to\n\n349\n00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.020\nwhat we actually want to be able to do.\n\n350\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.680\nAnd now leaves one though with\nthis allow annotations that we\n\n351\n00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.130\nneed to be able to change if\nwe do something like this.\n\n352\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:34.430\nNow this is where you're like,\nwhy didn't it fix everything, then?\n\n353\n00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.890\nWhy didn't it do everything\nthat we wanted to?\n\n354\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.120\nBecause it's, like I said,\nit's not fully baked in,\n\n355\n00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.090\nI don't know what else\ndo you wanna call it.\n\n356\n00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:46.270\nEverything is not done, so even though\nthey don't want you to actually do some\n\n357\n00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:52.530\ntype of modification to what they do,\nyou can modify it,\n\n358\n00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:57.770\nokay, but they really recommend strongly\nagainst you trying to customize anything.\n\n359\n00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:02.570\nThis is where the recommendation is to\ngo to the G-U-I, go to the web GUI.\n\n360\n00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.300\nJust put the check mark there and\nallow them to do it.\n\n361\n00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.680\nSo, can I do this?\n\n362\n00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.980\nYes, I can go in there and\nI can actually change this one,\n\n363\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.850\nif I choose to, okay, but at this\nparticular point, it's not something that\n\n364\n00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:19.700\nyou really want to do if you're unsure\nof how to make sure that you do that.\n\n365\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.630\nSo, it is a little bit scary to try and\njust go, all right I'm just gonna change\n\n366\n00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.190\nthis up and make sure that I\ncan modify and do all this.\n\n367\n00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:31.900\nBut from this point here,\nthat is what we want to take a look at.\n\n368\n00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.800\nThe great thing is we're really only\nfocusing in on one particular user,\n\n369\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.340\nis what we're doing.\n\n370\n00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.490\nSo that is what we're going to do as well,\nokay, so on this one,\n\n371\n00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:47.060\nlet me see if I can zoom out here for\na moment.\n\n372\n00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.550\nMake sure, yep there we go,\nI lost my mouse here for a moment.\n\n373\n00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.150\nLet me get all the way\ndown here to the end,\n\n374\n00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.170\nlet's say that we\nare going to choose Lance.\n\n375\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:02.540\nAnd what I want to do is I want to apply\nthat, the one with NoFT at the end,\n\n376\n00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.110\nto Lance himself.\n\n377\n00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:08.396\nYou currently saw that when I showed you,\nof course, these policies for Lance,\n\n378\n00:22:08.396 --> 00:22:09.921\nit wasn't actually there.\n\n379\n00:22:09.921 --> 00:22:13.307\nBut for this one, we can do this, and\n\n380\n00:22:13.307 --> 00:22:18.442\nthe way that we do this because\na policy already exists,\n\n381\n00:22:18.442 --> 00:22:23.248\nto assign this to Lance I\nstart off with the word Grant\n\n382\n00:22:23.248 --> 00:22:30.374\n-CsConferencingPolicy on the identity\nitself this is where I set Lance up.\n\n383\n00:22:30.374 --> 00:22:39.168\nSo lance@offficeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com,\n\n384\n00:22:39.168 --> 00:22:44.448\nthen I tell it what policy name.\n\n385\n00:22:44.448 --> 00:22:50.202\nLet me scroll out so we can see it, and\n\n386\n00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:57.270\nit is here I have to do\nthe bposSallModality,\n\n387\n00:23:03.454 --> 00:23:05.462\nNoft.\n\n388\n00:23:15.129 --> 00:23:16.397\nPress Enter there,\n\n389\n00:23:16.397 --> 00:23:20.690\nI get nothing that really does show\nme that anything has happened.\n\n390\n00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:27.780\nBut I should now be able to go and\nfind Lance's feature here,\n\n391\n00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:33.830\nand let's see if everything is\nnow set up for Lance as well.\n\n392\n00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.400\nSo this gives me this ability then,\nonce everything is done let's see if.\n\n393\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.470\nI'm wondering what the check mark\nis there, yep, so now you can see\n\n394\n00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:49.210\neven though I had it unchecked here on\nthe GUI, it is now checked for compliance.\n\n395\n00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:53.340\nSo now I've turned off those\nparticular non archived features\n\n396\n00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.770\nthat will allow me to\nnow be in compliance.\n\n397\n00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:00.490\nSo we can verify that everything\nis actually right here\n\n398\n00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.260\nin the way that we wanna do this.\n\n399\n00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.830\nBut setting it up just for\nLance is probably not the only thing,\n\n400\n00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.080\nit's just like I said Zach right\nat the beginning of this episode.\n\n401\n00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.140\nAnd we're gonna turn something like this\non and people are gonna be using this.\n\n402\n00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.290\nAnd I'm handling other\npeople's information,\n\n403\n00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.450\nit probably needs to be turned on for\neveryone.\n\n404\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:22.430\nSo even though we can use this with\nreally one person, the reason why\n\n405\n00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.640\nwe're also doing this in PowerShell\nis that we can do this for everyone.\n\n406\n00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.050\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie I'd love to\nfind out how we do that and\n\n407\n00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.415\ngo about it but I think we're\na little bit out of time right now.\n\n408\n00:24:30.415 --> 00:24:31.510\nCan we go to a part two?\n\n409\n00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.180\n&gt;&gt; We should go to a part two then\nbecause there's a lot more for\n\n410\n00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.780\nus to actually take a look at.\n\n411\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.740\nSo, thank you for stopping me cuz\nI probably would have gone on for\n\n412\n00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.070\na long time.\n\n413\n00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.280\n&gt;&gt; And listen, thank you

ITProTV\n\n3\n00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:10.886\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:16.880\nmaking the intelligent\nchoice to watch ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.840\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host, Zach Memos for\nenabling Office 365 services,\n\n6\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.860\nas we continue with configuring\nSkype end user settings.\n\n7\n00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.190\nThis is part two with Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.750\nRonnie, thanks for joining us again.\n\n9\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you again for\nhaving me back.\n\n10\n00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.700\nAs we continue on,\nwe take a look at Skype services here, and\n\n11\n00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.000\nwhat we have to kind of remember to do.\n\n12\n00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.100\nSo now that we're actually\nin the midst of this, let's\n\n13\n00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.510\nmake sure that we review of just a little\nbit of what we hit in part one as well.\n\n14\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.230\nSo, inside of part one, we talked about\nsome of the issues here with compliance.\n\n15\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.650\nThat as Office 365 is really\na collaboration service,\n\n16\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.850\nas well as email, and of course\nother services that are out there.\n\n17\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.040\nWe also need to think about compliance,\nand that has to do with searching for\n\n18\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.580\ninformation and communications that\ngo on inside of our business, and\n\n19\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.800\nif we're using Skype for Business, there\nare certain features in which are on by\n\n20\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.020\ndefault because it's the native\nway in which Skype for\n\n21\n00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.250\nBusiness works, then we really have to\ndisable to essentially make that work.\n\n22\n00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.620\nAnd, so\nwe showed you that inside of the part one,\n\n23\n00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.510\nwhere we essentially turned off some\nof these different non-archive features\n\n24\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.910\nthat allow us to get that all set up.\n\n25\n00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.660\nThen we of course talked about some of\nthe policies, and how we get that set up.\n\n26\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.330\nAnd, now we are in the midst of also\ntaking a look at some other things here.\n\n27\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.650\nWhere we're not only showing how\nwe could configure a policy for\n\n28\n00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.760\nan individual user, but\nwe need to get into this idea of, well,\n\n29\n00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.430\njust a little bit more\nis what we have to do.\n\n30\n00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie, and so if we need\neveryone to meet this compliance measure,\n\n31\n00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.790\ncan we do that as well?\n\n32\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.380\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n33\n00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.730\nSo at this point,\neven though we might say,\n\n34\n00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.950\nI wanna set a compliance policy for\nZach himself.\n\n35\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.160\nAnd the problem we have is Zach's\nprobably not the only one we need to set\n\n36\n00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.390\ncompliance for.\n\n37\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.120\nSo the great thing is there is a default\npolicy that is already set up, but\n\n38\n00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.170\nit may not be set up exactly for\nwhat you need it to be set up for, and\n\n39\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.030\nthis is where we have to go in and we must\nchange the default policy that's there.\n\n40\n00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.010\nNow, this is where it becomes a little\nbit stranger when we start saying,\n\n41\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.530\nhey, we need this to be a global setting\nfor these compliance settings to happen.\n\n42\n00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.080\nBut we can't do it in the same way that\nwe set up the individual policy like\n\n43\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.020\nwe showed in the first part of our show,\nokay?\n\n44\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.010\nWhat we need to do though is, we need to\nactually change it in a different way,\n\n45\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.480\nwhich is we're gonna be modifying what\nwe call the global policy itself.\n\n46\n00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.480\nNow, the reason why this\nis a little bit slow, and\n\n47\n00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.980\nwhy I'm being a little bit laborious about\nthis, is because it has changed over time.\n\n48\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.670\nThere was a Microsoft Ignite\nconference in 2016 In which I said,\n\n49\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.650\nlook, we're changing\nthis particular feature.\n\n50\n00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.290\nAt part one I've kind of told\nyou that you really can't assign\n\n51\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.926\npolicies in which you really customize,\n\n52\n00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:18.160\nin other words, you can't take these\npolicies and customize them to yourself.\n\n53\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.520\nCan you create a brand new policy?\n\n54\n00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.280\nYes.\n\n55\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.570\nBut you can't take existing policies that\nare inside of Skype for Business and\n\n56\n00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.090\nsay all right, I'm gonna customize this\npart, I'm gonna customize this part,\n\n57\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.970\nI'm I'm gonna do this, and\nthen make them all wrap up together.\n\n58\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.960\nThey just don't want you to do that.\n\n59\n00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.450\nSo, when they do that, that means you\neither have to pick from that, or\n\n60\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.220\nyou have to create a new one and apply it.\n\n61\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.860\nThe problem, though, is globally you can't\nactually pick from any one of those,\n\n62\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.230\nand say, I'm just gonna take\nthat as a template, and\n\n63\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.190\noverride the global policy by putting\nthis one on top of the global one.\n\n64\n00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.900\nThey don't allow that to happen.\n\n65\n00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.070\nThat Ignite Conference essentially\nchanged everything, and\n\n66\n00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.700\nthat's why there's a little bit of you\nknow, some conundrum in this, because\n\n67\n00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.850\nsome of the commands that we were trying\nto run before are no longer going to work.\n\n68\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.840\nSo now, now that we have\nan understanding of what we need to do,\n\n69\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.320\nwe need to be able to understand this.\n\n70\n00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.770\nThat what we're gonna do is,\nwe're take the policy\n\n71\n00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.200\nin which they did allow a little bit\nof configuration, but they say look,\n\n72\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.190\nif you do this, this is gonna affect\neverybody in the organization.\n\n73\n00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.890\nMake sure first that you know what\nit's gonna affect before you do it.\n\n74\n00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.290\nBut now they allow you to globally change\nthat policy, and now you're off and\n\n75\n00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.290\nyou're ready to go.\n\n76\n00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.040\nBut just remember that part of Office 365\nand Skype for Business, and getting these\n\n77\n00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.610\npolicies set up the way they want to, we\nnormally don't affect anything like this,\n\n78\n00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.660\nbut now we are going to, and that is\nsomething that they have recently changed.\n\n79\n00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.800\nSo, let's make sure that we\ncan show you how to do that.\n\n80\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.150\nThe other thing about this, is this\nnot available inside of the web UI.\n\n81\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.540\nSo, when somebody says can you change\nthis for everybody, yes it is possible.\n\n82\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.850\nBut it's also only gonna be done\nwithin the PowerShell as well.\n\n83\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.360\nSo that is something else that we'll\nalso need to make sure that we know\n\n84\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.850\nas we do this.\n\n85\n00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.870\nAll right, so here we are on PowerShell.\n\n86\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.250\nI'm just gonna run my\nget ps session command,\n\n87\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.690\njust to make sure that I'm\nstill connected There I am.\n\n88\n00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.340\nI'm still connected to Exchange,\nand, here,\n\n89\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.660\nI am connected to the Skype for\nBusiness PowerShell.\n\n90\n00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.250\nNow, remember, that I showed you earlier,\n\n91\n00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.180\nin the earlier episode, that they don't\nreally have a Skype for Business.\n\n92\n00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.210\nThis really is, kind of, pieced and\n\n93\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.080\nhobbled together from an older Microsoft\nlink product, is what they had.\n\n94\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.860\nSo this is the last one that\nwe're really concerned with.\n\n95\n00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.140\nAnd that is now opened and\nwe are ready to go here, okay.\n\n96\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.110\nSo the first thing and\nwe're gonna set this up globally and\n\n97\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.590\nmodify the way they want to.\n\n98\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.890\nWe wanna take a look at\nthe global policy itself.\n\n99\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.030\nSo if I do a get-cs conferencing\n\n100\n00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.190\nPolicy and that is the policy\nthat I really need to get.\n\n101\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.950\nI now need to tell it\nwhat policy that I want.\n\n102\n00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:11.010\nNow earlier in the part one I said that\nby default the policy that's actually\n\n103\n00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.880\nright here is one that is called, I wanna\nmake sure that I actually tell you right.\n\n104\n00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.257\nBPOSSALL modality.\n\n105\n00:06:19.257 --> 00:06:24.402\nAnd that one I showed you where everything\nwas kind of set the way that we want it\n\n106\n00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:29.300\nto be set, and it almost mirrors this idea\nof the global policy, so in the earlier\n\n107\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.860\nversion of the way that everything\nwas run that's what would happen, but\n\n108\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.770\ntoday it is called global\nis the one that we do see.\n\n109\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.510\nNow if I press enter at this point,\nwe are now going to see the policy,\n\n110\n00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.320\nwhich is great.\n\n111\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.340\nSo we can see that the true identity\nhere is the global policy and\n\n112\n00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.340\nwhat we're really paying\nattention to are those four\n\n113\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.340\ndifferent configurations that we\nwere taking a look at as well.\n\n114\n00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.740\nAnd if I scroll down,\nit came down to this disable.\n\n115\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.630\nPowerPoint annotations.\n\n116\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.610\nNow this is where it's a little bit tricky\nand Microsoft has done this for years.\n\n117\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.290\nWhere, it's funny how they do this right?\n\n118\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.860\nRight now it's set to faults, okay?\n\n119\n00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.550\nSo faults for\ndisabling PowerPoint annotations,\n\n120\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.840\nwhich means,\nwell PowerPoint annotations are true.\n\n121\n00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.280\nThey're enabled.\n\n122\n00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.710\nSo the strange thing is it\nhas that word disable there.\n\n123\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.190\nSo if you disable something and\nyou say make that False,\n\n124\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.300\nthat means it should be enabled, okay.\n\n125\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.840\nSo a weird kind of way to do this.\n\n126\n00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.630\nThe other one that we were also talking\nabout were OneNote, shared notes, and\n\n127\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.660\nthat one is True.\n\n128\n00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.890\nThat is one that we definitely\nwant it to be False.\n\n129\n00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.390\nThen if I scroll down,\nit's really these two options right here.\n\n130\n00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.128\nSo we were really focusing on\nthose four settings all together.\n\n131\n00:07:49.128 --> 00:07:52.141\nAnd these two enable file transfer and\n\n132\n00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:56.672\nthese enabled p to p,\nthe point to point file transfers.\n\n133\n00:07:56.672 --> 00:07:57.907\nThese are both set to true.\n\n134\n00:07:57.907 --> 00:07:59.974\nIn other words, allowing for\nfile transfers to happen.\n\n135\n00:07:59.974 --> 00:08:01.731\nWe don't want that to happen.\n\n136\n00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:05.580\nBecause this is something that we can't\nuse our tools to be able to search for\n\n137\n00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.878\ninformation, and communications, here.\n\n138\n00:08:07.878 --> 00:08:12.223\nSo, even though those are on,\nby default, globally, for everybody,\n\n139\n00:08:12.223 --> 00:08:14.517\nthis is the one that we want to change.\n\n140\n00:08:14.517 --> 00:08:17.749\nNow I had always tried to do this\nbecause I thought, of course,\n\n141\n00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:19.010\nthis will end up working.\n\n142\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.004\nBut because they've changed this,\nit no longer works.\n\n143\n00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:26.251\nRight, I simply said I'm gonna\ntake that BP OS whatever I said,\n\n144\n00:08:26.251 --> 00:08:28.068\nthat ended with modality.\n\n145\n00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:33.310\nAnd switch it with one that said NoFT at\nthe end which means no file transfer.\n\n146\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.820\nAnd that should give me\nthe settings that I want.\n\n147\n00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.233\nBut now, since adding and\nsince they've updated anything,\n\n148\n00:08:40.233 --> 00:08:42.419\nwe are not able to do that anymore.\n\n149\n00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:47.588\nSo, for this one,\nnow we actually turn this around.\n\n150\n00:08:47.588 --> 00:08:52.306\nAnd instead of actually\ndoing the get here,\n\n151\n00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:59.330\nwhat I actually need to do is\nset instead Conferencing, Cs.\n\n152\n00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.367\nConferencing policy,\n\n153\n00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:06.872\ngive the name of the policy that\nI want to affect which is Global.\n\n154\n00:09:06.872 --> 00:09:13.741\nNow I can go back in and start typing in\nthe name of each one of those settings.\n\n155\n00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:17.890\nAnd this disables\nthe PowerPoint annotation.\n\n156\n00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:23.250\nThis one, I want it to actually\nbe set to true, because\n\n157\n00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.850\nI want to truly disable that setting,\nso that's a setting that I want there.\n\n158\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:35.240\nThe second one that we looked at was,\nallow the OneNote or allow shared notes.\n\n159\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.390\nThat's the way that it's just here.\n\n160\n00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.580\nAnd on this one,\nI wanna set this one to faults.\n\n161\n00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.470\nSo I have to do the dollar sign, and\n\n162\n00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.430\nI have to spell faults correctly,\nhow's that?\n\n163\n00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:53.200\nThen I can do another dash and\nthis one will be EnableFileTransfer and\n\n164\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.360\nI wanna make sure that one is false.\n\n165\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.812\nAnd the last one is pretty much the same,\nEnableP2PFileTansfer.\n\n166\n00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:07.971\nAnd now that one should also be false,\nhere.\n\n167\n00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:09.652\nSo if that accepts it,\n\n168\n00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:15.230\nI should be able to run the same command\nthat I ran earlier to get the policy.\n\n169\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.826\nAnd we should now be able to see\nwhere these settings have changed.\n\n170\n00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:21.356\nSo, the easiest way, right now,\nthat I can see that,\n\n171\n00:10:21.356 --> 00:10:23.339\nis I'm gonna take a look\nat these last two.\n\n172\n00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:26.620\nAnd note that those are actually true,\nfor right now.\n\n173\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.600\nBut then, I'll go back in, let me\nsee if I can run this command again.\n\n174\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.640\nMaybe, it's not letting\nme click in it here.\n\n175\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.680\nWhy is it not letting me click it?\n\n176\n00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.630\nThere we go.\n\n177\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.320\nIt's just me and\nmy typing skills more than anything else.\n\n178\n00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.493\nNotice that the disable\nPowerPoint annotation is True and\n\n179\n00:10:45.493 --> 00:10:49.324\nthis is set up in the global policy\nwhich means it applies to everyone.\n\n180\n00:10:49.324 --> 00:10:53.880\nThis one as well, the allow and\nshare notes is now False.\n\n181\n00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.099\nAnd then of course as I scroll down and\nlook for\n\n182\n00:10:57.099 --> 00:11:02.028\nthe EnableFileTransfer these two\nhave now been set to False as well.\n\n183\n00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:08.422\nSo this gives me that ability then to say\nwithout having to kind of really do much.\n\n184\n00:11:08.422 --> 00:11:12.536\nTo know that the global policy is\nnow set to those same settings.\n\n185\n00:11:12.536 --> 00:11:17.427\nWhere we showed you a single check mark\ninstead where everything is turned on.\n\n186\n00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:21.202\nNow the other thing that it didn't\ndo is that it doesn't go into every\n\n187\n00:11:21.202 --> 00:11:24.861\nsingle individual user and\nput a check mark in that GUI interface.\n\n188\n00:11:24.861 --> 00:11:27.709\nBut you can see right here\nit's the global policy.\n\n189\n00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:30.391\nThe global policy will apply to everyone.\n\n190\n00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:32.990\nAnd that is the key that\nwe'll actually have.\n\n191\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.037\nThat will say that we can not only enable\nthis type of compliance policy for\n\n192\n00:11:37.037 --> 00:11:39.659\nindividuals if we want to,\nor even for a group.\n\n193\n00:11:39.659 --> 00:11:43.557\nWe can actually set it out for\nentire organization too.\n\n194\n00:11:43.557 --> 00:11:47.375\nAnd that is gonna be a big part\nof what we need to be able to do.\n\n195\n00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:53.586\nSo it really does help us out when we have\nsomebody coming to us with questions.\n\n196\n00:11:53.586 --> 00:11:58.330\nAbout setting up these compliance\npolicies to make that happen, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.750\nSo it's really a good thing for\nus when we do this.\n\n198\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:07.490\nNow the other thing that we also have\nto do in Skype is get the product or\n\n199\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.930\nthe end user product itself set up for\nuse.\n\n200\n00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.320\nSo let me scroll and let me show\nyou on another machine over here.\n\n201\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.320\nAnd I believe that Skype is running,\nit is.\n\n202\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.070\nLet me check out the,\nlet me open this up so that we can see it.\n\n203\n00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.400\nAnd I'll pull it here to the center,\nall right, oops.\n\n204\n00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.879\nI'll try and\npull it to the center here, okay.\n\n205\n00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:34.579\nRight now we have a whole bunch of\ninformation right up here at the top.\n\n206\n00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:39.280\nLet me try and see if I can do this\na little bit more so, there we go.\n\n207\n00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.790\nNotice that I have this bar up here\nthat gives me information, okay?\n\n208\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.160\nWhat is happening today?\n\n209\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.200\nAnd when somebody else sees this on their\nscreen with my name beside it, right?\n\n210\n00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.950\nThey'll actually see if I typed in\nsomething like, I'm in the middle and\n\n211\n00:12:53.950 --> 00:13:00.540\nprocess of recording the Office 365 show.\n\n212\n00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.130\nThey don't have to interrupt me\nin the middle of my process and\n\n213\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.100\nwonder what am I actually up to today.\n\n214\n00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.790\nWhat's actually happening\nas I'm doing that.\n\n215\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.280\nThe other thing that we'll\nalso see is right here,\n\n216\n00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.678\nthis little tiny green check mark\nthat says that I am available.\n\n217\n00:13:16.678 --> 00:13:21.937\nBut notice, also, that there is a way\nto change that availability setting.\n\n218\n00:13:21.937 --> 00:13:24.910\nLet me zoom out just a little bit.\n\n219\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.220\nAnd I'll grab that and put it up here.\n\n220\n00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:34.470\nNotice I can even change this to Busy if\nI choose to, as well as Do not disturb.\n\n221\n00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.340\nAnd Be right back.\n\n222\n00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.600\nAnd now notice that all of\nthat information is there.\n\n223\n00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.450\nNow you might be wondering a little bit\nof this if this is your first time seeing\n\n224\n00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.030\nthis, what does that matter?\n\n225\n00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.260\nWhy does that, who cares?\n\n226\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.720\nWhy is this important?\n\n227\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.083\nThis is important because\nin an organization, right,\n\n228\n00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:56.101\nthis information shows up not only for\nme as I'm logged in as Joey.\n\n229\n00:13:56.101 --> 00:14:02.560\nIt shows up for, well, everybody else that\ncan see my particular presence online.\n\n230\n00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.290\nThey can know what I'm up to.\n\n231\n00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.770\nThey can even have\nthe idea of my username.\n\n232\n00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.057\nThey can even see my\navailability setting here,\n\n233\n00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:12.710\nas well as my location, if I wanted to.\n\n234\n00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:17.470\nThere's also, of course, meetings that\nI might be a part of, conversations,\n\n235\n00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.945\nyou name it, contacts.\n\n236\n00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:21.852\nThere is a ton of information right here.\n\n237\n00:14:21.852 --> 00:14:26.202\nBut mostly, up here at the very top,\nthis is what we call the Skype for\n\n238\n00:14:26.202 --> 00:14:29.878\nBusiness presence as what we're take and\nlook at, okay.\n\n239\n00:14:29.878 --> 00:14:34.008\nSo presence includes\nthe availability status, the color.\n\n240\n00:14:34.008 --> 00:14:37.320\nThat's what we're talking about, a little\ngreen color mark that you see there,\n\n241\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.250\nan indicator.\n\n242\n00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:43.320\nScheduling, locations, status messages,\nout of office notes, you name it.\n\n243\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.178\nThose are big pieces of information.\n\n244\n00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:49.343\nEven though they seem tiny and\ninsignificant right now.\n\n245\n00:14:49.343 --> 00:14:54.214\nIn an organization where now I might go,\nZach's in the middle of a meeting,\n\n246\n00:14:54.214 --> 00:14:55.670\nwhat meeting is he in?\n\n247\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.580\nIf you type that in,\nright up here at the beginning,\n\n248\n00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.478\nI don't have to worry about it, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:59.478 --> 00:15:00.340\nOr he may say,\n\n250\n00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.770\nlook, I'm gonna actually be,\nI don't need to be disturbed right now.\n\n251\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.000\nSo if Zach is in the middle\nof typing something for\n\n252\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.140\nhis next exciting novel that he's writing.\n\n253\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.470\nHe goes should I interrupt him?\n\n254\n00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:14.320\nWell it says what?\n\n255\n00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.870\nDo not disturb.\n\n256\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.920\nIt actually gives him\nthat ability to do so.\n\n257\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.770\nSo with the presence of this information,\nwe have to be careful with it too.\n\n258\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.530\nThe reason why is because\nthis information does go out\n\n259\n00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.000\npretty much globally throughout\nour entire organization.\n\n260\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.300\nBut Skype for\nBusiness itself in terms of our product\n\n261\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.000\nis not just limited to\nour own organization.\n\n262\n00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.721\nIn other words it's connected to a world\nwide infrastructure in the web that says,\n\n263\n00:15:46.721 --> 00:15:51.226\nhey, this can actually happen\nif you're not paying attention.\n\n264\n00:15:51.226 --> 00:15:56.323\nWe can take your presence and your\nparticular individual information here.\n\n265\n00:15:56.323 --> 00:16:01.200\nAnd anybody that's running Skype for\nBusiness, if you allowed it go up,\n\n266\n00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.430\nit will show it to everybody on the planet\nthat's running Skype for Business as well.\n\n267\n00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.050\nSo it can really kind of all of\na sudden somewhere across the world,\n\n268\n00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.780\nsomebody else could be looking going,\nhey, I noticed something here.\n\n269\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.210\nJoey is actually available for\na conversation.\n\n270\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.430\nLet me see if I click on it right now and\nsee and now you're going like,\n\n271\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.940\nwhy am I getting this strange request\nfrom somebody I don't even know?\n\n272\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.890\nIt is possible.\n\n273\n00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.240\nI'm not saying that's the way\nthat it should be set up, but\n\n274\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.320\nall of this stuff is very\npossible to have happen, okay?\n\n275\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.320\nSo we really want to make\nsure that we understand\n\n276\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.520\nthe groups of people that\nour information shows up to.\n\n277\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:43.160\nSo, let's go ahead and\nshow you how this plays out as well,\n\n278\n00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.200\nespecially within our organization.\n\n279\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.584\nAnd I'm simply gonna show you\na web page link right now so\n\n280\n00:16:48.584 --> 00:16:53.420\nthat you can see the entire table of the\ntype of information that shows up there.\n\n281\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.548\nSo here's the web page\nthat I was talking about.\n\n282\n00:16:57.548 --> 00:17:00.413\nWe'll have this link inside\nof the show notes for you, so\n\n283\n00:17:00.413 --> 00:17:04.170\ndon't worry about trying to copy\nthis down so that you can see this.\n\n284\n00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.470\nAnd this is exactly what I was\ntelling you why the reason this\n\n285\n00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.360\ninformation is very important.\n\n286\n00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.700\nIt gives you that availability status,\npresence indicator.\n\n287\n00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.770\nYou name it, that's what we have.\n\n288\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:18.800\nYou'll also see right here where it talks\nabout privacy relationships for Skype.\n\n289\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.010\nAnd it breaks down to just\na few different categories and\n\n290\n00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.880\nwe're not gonna read\nthrough the paragraphs.\n\n291\n00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.960\nBut I do want to show you right here\non this idea of privacy levels,\n\n292\n00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.210\ngive access to what types of information?\n\n293\n00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.610\nSo at this point, it essentially breaks\ndown to four different groups, right?\n\n294\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:41.220\nExternal Contacts, anybody outside\nof our Office 365 organization.\n\n295\n00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.019\nColleagues, of course, there are also\nthe idea of colleagues here.\n\n296\n00:17:45.019 --> 00:17:49.401\nA little bit more, it can be that\nthey are part of our business, but\n\n297\n00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:53.644\nit might be that they are partners\nto a business that we do trust.\n\n298\n00:17:53.644 --> 00:17:57.980\nWorkgroup, of course,\nis really when it comes down to it,\n\n299\n00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.570\nprobably most people\nwithin our organization.\n\n300\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.140\nAnd then there's even Friends &amp; Family.\n\n301\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.250\nSo you can see,\nlike here on Presence information,\n\n302\n00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.290\njust about everybody gets\nthe majority of this stuff, right?\n\n303\n00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:15.800\nPresence, Presence Status,\nDisplay Name, Email Address, and Title.\n\n304\n00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.113\nAll that's possible.\n\n305\n00:18:17.113 --> 00:18:21.758\nBut then as you start scrolling down,\nnotice that for the external contacts and\n\n306\n00:18:21.758 --> 00:18:27.184\ncolleagues, Work Phone, Mobile Phone, Home\nPhone, all that stuff just disappears now.\n\n307\n00:18:27.184 --> 00:18:31.480\nAnd that's because we don't really wanna\nshow everybody all of that information.\n\n308\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.750\nBut if you had all this filled out for\nyour organization, you don't have to worry\n\n309\n00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:39.150\nabout that, but they do still have\na bunch of this stuff right here too.\n\n310\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.900\nCompany, sure, of course, colleagues and\nexternal people can see that.\n\n311\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.590\nAre you running Office?\n\n312\n00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:49.720\nYeah, great, and then even other\ninformation that's really more situated.\n\n313\n00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.258\nAnd as you start doing that, right,\nexternal people don't need to know\n\n314\n00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:56.160\nwhether you're free, busy,\nhours working, location.\n\n315\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.780\nNotes that you're sharing,\nwhen was the last time you were active.\n\n316\n00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.430\nThey don't actually need to know all that.\n\n317\n00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:07.170\nBut it does come with even Personal Photo\nWeb Address if you want to as well.\n\n318\n00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.780\nSo, there are a lot of these\ndifferent categories and\n\n319\n00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.100\nif you wanna learn a little bit more about\nthem, the paragraph's right up here.\n\n320\n00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.890\nWe're not gonna spend the time,\nlike I said, I'm not gonna read it to you.\n\n321\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.640\nBut you can actually learn\na little bit about them.\n\n322\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.945\nI would make sure that I understand this,\nespecially as I'm preparing for the exam.\n\n323\n00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:27.030\nIt's kind of key, right, that we\nunderstand what amount of information\n\n324\n00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.000\nwe're putting out there, and it comes\ndown to different privacy settings.\n\n325\n00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.170\nSo we may find out that within\nour organization we don't want\n\n326\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.970\neverybody to have everything\nthat's on there right?\n\n327\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.571\nSo we can go in and set that up too.\n\n328\n00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:45.254\nOf course, that means you have to actually\nable to do it not only in the GUI,\n\n329\n00:19:45.254 --> 00:19:47.650\nif you have the chance to, or the web UI.\n\n330\n00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.090\nBut you have to be able\nto do it in PowerShell.\n\n331\n00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:53.942\nSo we're gonna stick to the PowerShell\nat this point to kind of help\n\n332\n00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:57.440\nus out to focus in on what we wanna do.\n\n333\n00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.583\nLet me clear the screen here.\n\n334\n00:19:58.583 --> 00:20:02.047\nI'm going back to the PowerShell so\nthat we can get this set up for\n\n335\n00:20:02.047 --> 00:20:03.380\nthe user as well.\n\n336\n00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:11.750\nThe command that we want here is\nto get CS Privacy configuration.\n\n337\n00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.930\nAnd in a moment,\nthis is what we are looking for, and\n\n338\n00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.450\nyou want to make sure you pay\nattention to these settings.\n\n339\n00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:24.846\nThe identity right now is global, and the\nenable privacy mode right now is false.\n\n340\n00:20:24.846 --> 00:20:27.550\nNow that doesn't sound like a good idea,\ndoes it, Zack?\n\n341\n00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.382\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n\n342\n00:20:28.382 --> 00:20:31.873\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the very fact is, I'm saying,\nhey, privacy settings here,\n\n343\n00:20:31.873 --> 00:20:34.493\nyeah, whatever's actually there,\nit's false.\n\n344\n00:20:34.493 --> 00:20:39.290\nWhen we change this, we kind of want\nto reverse this is what we want to do.\n\n345\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.048\nWe wanna make sure that\nthe privacy settings are true.\n\n346\n00:20:42.048 --> 00:20:45.450\nBut the autoinitiate contacts,\n\n347\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:49.230\nwe don't want somebody to be able\nto autoinitiate and get contacts.\n\n348\n00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.600\nSame thing with my location data,\nI don't want them to do that either.\n\n349\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.250\nSame thing with published photo,\n\n350\n00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.240\nif I don't want to, I don't want\nthem to be able to do all that.\n\n351\n00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.800\nI want them to really ask and make sure\nthat none of this stuff is automatic.\n\n352\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.980\nThe great thing about this command, and\nsome of the PowerShell stuff that we get,\n\n353\n00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.910\nit really is neat when we start\nto set some of this stuff up.\n\n354\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.090\nBecause it tells me when\nI'm missing something.\n\n355\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.207\nSo let's go ahead and\njust set this thing up and\n\n356\n00:21:14.207 --> 00:21:16.116\nthen we'll see what I'm talking about.\n\n357\n00:21:16.116 --> 00:21:21.655\nSet CS privacy configuration, then I'm\ngonna choose of course the identity,\n\n358\n00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:25.550\nwhich is gonna match the one\non the top of that list here.\n\n359\n00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:30.680\nIdentity is gonna be global, okay?\n\n360\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.620\nWhen I go ahead and let's just say\nthat I wanna do the first one here,\n\n361\n00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:41.890\nwhich is enable the privacy mode,\nit's gonna be $true.\n\n362\n00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.640\nI want you to watch what\nhappens if I just do that then\n\n363\n00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.090\nI forget about the rest of the settings.\n\n364\n00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.085\nNow, notice that it gives\nme this yellow warning.\n\n365\n00:21:51.085 --> 00:21:52.758\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of red.\n\n366\n00:21:52.758 --> 00:21:56.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe I'm really,\nreally, colorblind at this point.\n\n367\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.568\nYellow warning, right?\n\n368\n00:21:57.568 --> 00:22:01.116\nAnd the only thing it's telling me is,\nlook, you can do that but\n\n369\n00:22:01.116 --> 00:22:04.980\nthat's really gonna contradict\nthese other three, right?\n\n370\n00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.810\nYou're saying you want all this privacy,\nbut you've still got all these other\n\n371\n00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.090\nthings turned on that says,\nautomatically let this stuff happen.\n\n372\n00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.720\nSo it's telling you that the way that\nyou do this is that we recommend\n\n373\n00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.530\nthat you also set these\nother ones to false.\n\n374\n00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.610\nSo that is descriptive.\n\n375\n00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.470\nThat is insanely helpful.\n\n376\n00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.580\nInstead of me going,\nI wonder why it's balking at this thing.\n\n377\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.201\nIt's not balking, it's just providing\nme additional information so, look,\n\n378\n00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:33.224\nyou set it up this way.\n\n379\n00:22:33.224 --> 00:22:35.900\nBut if you just run this now,\nI have to spell identity.\n\n380\n00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:41.138\n[COUGH] What I'm gonna\nsee everything is true,\n\n381\n00:22:41.138 --> 00:22:46.220\nand this saying that's not a good thing.\n\n382\n00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.820\nBecause it can't enable privacy\n\n383\n00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.400\nwhile you still actually have automatic\nstuff here turned on to do this.\n\n384\n00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.220\nSo the great thing is all we have\nto do now Is go in there and\n\n385\n00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.320\nselect some of the other ones here.\n\n386\n00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.876\nSo I can just start typing in the publish,\nmaybe if I can spell publish.\n\n387\n00:23:05.876 --> 00:23:10.235\nPublish location data.\n\n388\n00:23:10.235 --> 00:23:15.851\nAnd this one we'll set to false, and\nthen I'll do a space and a dash.\n\n389\n00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:19.226\nI'll autoinitiate,\n\n390\n00:23:19.226 --> 00:23:25.090\nif I can spell it, initiate contacts.\n\n391\n00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.580\nThis one we'll also set to false.\n\n392\n00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.110\nAnd then the last one here,\nI make sure I spell it right.\n\n393\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.677\nDisplay, oops.\n\n394\n00:23:39.677 --> 00:23:42.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're almost there.\n\n395\n00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:42.880\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n\n396\n00:23:48.192 --> 00:23:53.182\nDisplayPublished, not if I could spell it.\n\n397\n00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:56.851\nPublished photo\n\n398\n00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:04.243\nDefault, this one is also\ngonna be set to false.\n\n399\n00:24:06.689 --> 00:24:08.269\nOops.\n\n400\n00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:11.152\nPublish, location data default.\n\n401\n00:24:11.152 --> 00:24:11.685\nSee?\n\n402\n00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:13.571\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So the great thing is it at least told\n\n403\n00:24:13.571 --> 00:24:15.212\nme what was actually wrong here.\n\n404\n00:24:17.437 --> 00:24:22.378\nWhich is I did not actually fulfill\nwhat I needed to which was default,\n\n405\n00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:23.562\nhere at the end.\n\n406\n00:24:26.232 --> 00:24:29.621\nPublish location data.\n\n407\n00:24:35.655 --> 00:24:36.505\nLet me see.\n\n408\n00:24:36.505 --> 00:24:38.225\nMaybe I can't spell at all.\n\n409\n00:24:38.225 --> 00:24:43.960\n[LAUGH]\nLet's get this right here.\n\n410\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:52.229\nOops, let me scroll over a little bit,\nsee if I can copy this one.\n\n411\n00:24:52.229 --> 00:24:52.958\nPublish.\n\n412\n00:24:56.752 --> 00:24:58.357\nLocation.\n\n413\n00:24:58.357 --> 00:25:02.094\nData, default.\n\n414\n00:25:02.094 --> 00:25:04.866\nAnd I'm gonna add in the other\none in case it's blocking, and\n\n415\n00:25:04.866 --> 00:25:06.750\nthe fact that I'm missing one here too.\n\n416\n00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.325\nIt usually isn't going to.\n\n417\n00:25:08.325 --> 00:25:14.870\nBut enable privacy mode, and\nthis one I wanted to be true.\n\n418\n00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.935\nPublish location data default.\n\n419\n00:25:21.935 --> 00:25:26.904\nAnd then the auto initiate contacts.\n\n420\n00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.229\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\ndid your typing fail you again?\n\n421\n00:25:32.229 --> 00:25:37.460\n&gt;&gt; You know something Zach, now that I\nlook at it, it absolutely failed me again.\n\n422\n00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.520\nI should have realized,\n\n423\n00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.480\njust like everything else that I do\nI was trying to set these parameters.\n\n424\n00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.250\nAnd if you notice right\ndown here on the screen,\n\n425\n00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:48.850\nI'm trying to scroll over to it now,\nI actually put the word Get right here.\n\n426\n00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.900\nSo that is probably what\nactually failed me, and\n\n427\n00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.360\nthe way that we can test that out is\nby maybe setting the word set here.\n\n428\n00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.090\nMaking sure that everything is good,\nand if anything now that fails me is\n\n429\n00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.560\nprobably gonna be my typing again, if I\ndidn't spell everything correctly here.\n\n430\n00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.300\nAnd now we'll see what happens.\n\n431\n00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.590\nAnd there it is.\n\n432\n00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:18.510\nSo now it took it, but we can also\ndo the Get-CsPrivacyConfiguration.\n\n433\n00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.675\nLet's do the identity and verify.\n\n434\n00:26:23.578 --> 00:26:25.850\nThat this is exactly what we want.\n\n435\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.870\nAnd this is exactly what we want.\n\n436\n00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.870\nWe want privacy enabled.\n\n437\n00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.510\nWe do not want\nthe AutoInitiateContacts to happen.\n\n438\n00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:38.570\nWe don't want to publish our\nlocation data as a default.\n\n439\n00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:42.140\nWe don't want to display\nour photo by default.\n\n440\n00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.500\nNow I've got some of those privacy\nsettings beginning to set up and\n\n441\n00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.790\nhelp me out a little bit more.\n\n442\n00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:54.230\nSo by allowing the end user to be able to\nconfigure this, it really does help them,\n\n443\n00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:58.420\nyou know, to know that hey,\nhere's our default settings.\n\n444\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.370\nAnd the great thing about\ndoing it this way, right?\n\n445\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.048\nIs I set it as my global default.\n\n446\n00:27:03.048 --> 00:27:07.425\nThis may be great for someone like me\nthat doesn't want anything like that.\n\n447\n00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:09.936\nBut there may be other people out\nthere who go, you know I don't mind.\n\n448\n00:27:09.936 --> 00:27:13.126\nAnd now they can actually change\naccording to what they want, and\n\n449\n00:27:13.126 --> 00:27:16.551\nthat will allow them to have a little\nbit of freedom and control there.\n\n450\n00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:20.652\nYou may actually end up doing another one\nthat says I'm not gonna allow changes or\n\n451\n00:27:20.652 --> 00:27:21.927\nthe user to change that.\n\n452\n00:27:21.927 --> 00:27:24.745\nBut for\nus this is probably a great setting, and\n\n453\n00:27:24.745 --> 00:27:27.705\nit really does allow the end\nuser configuration to\n\n454\n00:27:27.705 --> 00:27:32.311\nget set up a little bit more with your\ncontrol and your blessing on it than not.\n\n455\n00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:35.900\nZach, there's a lot more for us to go, but\n\n456\n00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.772\nonce again I have talked our way through\nall the time that we have available.\n\n457\n00:27:40.772 --> 00:27:42.180\n&gt;&gt; Well thanks for covering all of that.\n\n458\n00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna have part three,\n\n459\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.006\nof Configure Skype End-User Settings,\n\n460\n00:27:47.006 --> 00:27:50.484\nas we continue with\nEnabling Office 365 Services.\n\n461\n00:27:50.484 -->

00:00:08.143\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:11.127\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:16.270\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.990\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.900\nAs we continue with enabling\nOffice 365 services.\n\n8\n00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.422\nThis is gonna be part three of configuring\nor to configure Skype and user settings.\n\n9\n00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:29.570\nRonnie, good to see you again.\n\n10\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.008\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you again for\nhaving me back.\n\n11\n00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:33.545\n&gt;&gt; Can you kinda give us a recap\nwhere we've been, where we're going?\n\n12\n00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:36.323\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nsince we're actually in a part three,\n\n13\n00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:39.736\nit makes a little bit of a sense,\nto just kinda recap a little bit.\n\n14\n00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:42.308\nWhen we started off with\ntaking a look at Skype for\n\n15\n00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:46.278\nBusiness, we of course showed you how\nto setup some compliance settings.\n\n16\n00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:49.052\nMake sure that we understand\nthe policies there,\n\n17\n00:00:49.052 --> 00:00:51.760\nand why we need to take\ncare of that as well.\n\n18\n00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.640\nWe showed you how you could set that\nup for compliance for individuals.\n\n19\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.820\nAs well as in last episode,\nwe talked about a global setting, and\n\n20\n00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.260\nhow you normally apply that.\n\n21\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.830\nRemember, these settings\nhave changed over time.\n\n22\n00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.600\nSo even if you're used to doing it in one\nway, you might find out next time you\n\n23\n00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.090\ntry and do this if you've been working it,\nit might not work exactly that way again.\n\n24\n00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.070\nSo check those things out.\n\n25\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.469\nI don't know why they update this\none as regularly, but it is,\n\n26\n00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:20.090\nthis one is one of the ones\nthat's continually changing.\n\n27\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.173\nSo we saw that as well as talked about\nsome basic what we call the Skype for\n\n28\n00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:27.630\nBusiness presence settings, and\n\n29\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.647\nhow we go about changing the policy\nas far as the privacy goes for that.\n\n30\n00:01:32.647 --> 00:01:37.090\nSo that users can now actually\nadjust their own policies too.\n\n31\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.680\nAnd the organization can have\na particular privacy setting as well.\n\n32\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.880\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie now, are there any other\nservices that we need to take a look at?\n\n33\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah there are just a few\nother ones, at least from he standpoint\n\n34\n00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.830\nof the end user, that they really\nneed to begin to get a hold of.\n\n35\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.810\nThe very fact is, most organizations,\nif they didn't start off with Skype for\n\n36\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.100\nBusiness, most people are never\ngonna use it as fully and\n\n37\n00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.290\neffectively as what we've talked about.\n\n38\n00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.610\nSo let me show you what I'm talking\nabout here, just briefly, and\n\n39\n00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.220\njust looking at the user interface for\nSkype for Business.\n\n40\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.571\nMost people, if they do anything like\nthis, they can, of course, use it for\n\n41\n00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:18.295\ninstant messaging across\ntheir organization.\n\n42\n00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:21.920\nBut that might be their primary mode for\ninstant messaging.\n\n43\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.360\nSome organizations, though,\nactually fully us for\n\n44\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.900\ntheir actual telephone system as well,\nwhere they do connect in and they do that.\n\n45\n00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.820\nNotice that there's also a meeting\nsystem here, as well as being\n\n46\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.100\nable to follow conversations, being able\nto do a whole bunch of other things here.\n\n47\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.520\nWe can share files,\nwe can do a lot of things.\n\n48\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.555\nSo this really can become kind of\na heart communication strategy for\n\n49\n00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:51.974\nour entire organization.\n\n50\n00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:54.440\nBut most users are probably\nnot gonna do that.\n\n51\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.380\nNow along with that,\nI was trying to get to this point,\n\n52\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.080\nI was like why am I saying all this?\n\n53\n00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.400\nBut the reason why I'm saying all this\nis because it includes video stuff.\n\n54\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.169\nSkype, it makes sense, right, cuz that's\npretty much how it really first started,\n\n55\n00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.820\nincluding the video stuff that we have and\navailable.\n\n56\n00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.456\nSo when it comes out to it, most people\ndon't think of Skype as being kind of\n\n57\n00:03:13.456 --> 00:03:17.360\na collaboration system, but\nmore of a communication system as well.\n\n58\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.019\nSo those are some of the basic services\nthat we need to make sure that people\n\n59\n00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.340\nunderstand that they can actually\nenable and get this ready to go.\n\n60\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.020\nSo let's take a look at it from\nthe admin standpoint and how we do this.\n\n61\n00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.640\nWe of course are going to take a look\nat the web UI interface first.\n\n62\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.186\nSo here on the web UI,\nI'm logged in to my Office 365 account.\n\n63\n00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:41.779\nI'm going to select the Admin tile,\nand once I do,\n\n64\n00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:47.160\nthat should bring me of course\ninto the Office 365 Admin Center.\n\n65\n00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.946\nOver on the left-hand side,\nI'm gonna scroll down once again, and\n\n66\n00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:56.580\nlook for the Admin Centers icon,\nthen select Skype for Business.\n\n67\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.314\nOnce I get into Skype for Business,\nit's relatively easy on some of the things\n\n68\n00:04:01.314 --> 00:04:06.080\nthat end users are really expecting\nto see, and be able to do as well.\n\n69\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.058\nSo here on the dashboard there are a few\nthings that we're taking a look at.\n\n70\n00:04:10.058 --> 00:04:13.070\nBut you can see my organization\nis not exactly large.\n\n71\n00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.520\nThere's three Skype for Business users.\n\n72\n00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.295\nTwo that can do like dial in conferencing\nagain telephonic things that they\n\n73\n00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:24.100\nwant to for conferencing, but\nI'm going to select users.\n\n74\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.873\nAnd for a particular individual user\nwe'll pick on Lance again he's kind of my\n\n75\n00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:32.770\nguinea pig for\njust about everything that I've done.\n\n76\n00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.450\nBut we want to talk about these\nsettings right here in particular.\n\n77\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.127\nAnd notice the first one which is auto and\n\n78\n00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:45.180\nvideo ok that's probably what most people\nthink about when the think about Skype.\n\n79\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.851\nAnd we have this ability, right.\n\n80\n00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:51.425\nThese are services that are out there\nwhere we can setup the audio and\n\n81\n00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:53.730\nvideo types of setting.\n\n82\n00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.558\nWe can do the audio and\nHD video which, again,\n\n83\n00:04:56.558 --> 00:04:59.030\nrequires a bit of bandwidth if you do it.\n\n84\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.676\nAnd actually, speaking of that,\nas a reminder here,\n\n85\n00:05:02.676 --> 00:05:05.640\nin the presence information as well.\n\n86\n00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.680\nEven though HD video takes up a lot,\nbelieve it or\n\n87\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.300\nnot, even the presence setting that\nwe're talking about in the last episode,\n\n88\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.660\nit can take up a tremendous amount\nof bandwidth for your organization.\n\n89\n00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.261\nThat's not because you go well,\nhow does availability and\n\n90\n00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:20.970\nhow does it do all that stuff?\n\n91\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.410\nWell, it actually does take up a bandwidth\n\n92\n00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.680\nbecause that stuff is communication\nconstantly as you're doing this.\n\n93\n00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.750\nSo, if you add in this and HD video,\n\n94\n00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.620\nhigh definition video,\nit's gonna take up some more bandwidth.\n\n95\n00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.550\nSo you may choose to do a bit of lower\nquality, or Audio only, or even None.\n\n96\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.690\nAnd this will set it up for\n\n97\n00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.950\nthat user to do none, if that is what\nwe're actually choosing to be able to do.\n\n98\n00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.650\nSo it's very possible that we can set\nthis up In terms of the audio and\n\n99\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.050\nvideo, very easily for an individual user.\n\n100\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.020\nNow, doing this one at a time,\nthat's fine.\n\n101\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.290\nAnd that maybe the way that you want\nto set this self for the organization.\n\n102\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:05.310\nSo for example, even here at ITProTV,\nwe used Office 365 every day.\n\n103\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.970\nBut my particular account isn't\nreally situated with the Skype for\n\n104\n00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.700\nBusiness, fully for the audio and\nvisual stuff, right?\n\n105\n00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.140\nI can use it for pretty much messaging,\nthat's pretty much it for\n\n106\n00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.840\nwhat I have access and\nthe availability to do.\n\n107\n00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.720\nSo, going in and actually setting this up\nfor the individual user would be normally\n\n108\n00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.125\nfor the user that has that subscription\nthat says you can do all this stuff.\n\n109\n00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:33.412\nAnd you may even have to pay\na premium price, especially for\n\n110\n00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:35.430\nthe Telephonic stuff as well.\n\n111\n00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.320\nSo, now, there's another add-on\ncomponent that you may have to have.\n\n112\n00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.917\nSo, it can get a little bit expensive as\nyou start adding on components to make all\n\n113\n00:06:42.917 --> 00:06:43.600\nthis work.\n\n114\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.167\nBut once you get it in place, right,\nand you start working with it,\n\n115\n00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:50.870\nit probably does end up, after awhile,\nsaving a little bit of money.\n\n116\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.097\nBut, at the same time you may\ndecide then that we need these\n\n117\n00:06:55.097 --> 00:06:57.610\ntypes of settings here globally.\n\n118\n00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.234\nIn other words, for everybody that\ncan do it, we need to set that up.\n\n119\n00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:03.709\nAnd the problem that we have is simple,\n\n120\n00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:09.090\nwe don't have these settings inside\nthe web UI to enable this stuff globally.\n\n121\n00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.650\nSo that means, of course you gotta\ngo into the PowerShell to do this.\n\n122\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.317\nSo let's take a look at\nthe PowerShell again.\n\n123\n00:07:17.317 --> 00:07:20.531\nAnd once again,\nlet me make sure that I'm still connected,\n\n124\n00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:22.120\nif not I'll need to connect.\n\n125\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.230\nSo I'm still connected to the Skype for\nBusiness PowerShell,\n\n126\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.040\nwhich is this last one that I have.\n\n127\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.330\nI’ve been connected to Exchange\npretty much all day long, so,\n\n128\n00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.310\nI didn’t just disconnect right there.\n\n129\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:39.525\nBut once I’m here, I need to get\nthe CSConferencingpolicy again,\n\n130\n00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:44.850\nand we’re gonna take a look\nat the global policy.\n\n131\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.890\nNow, let me do it properly here Identity.\n\n132\n00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:53.633\nAnd the global policy.\n\n133\n00:07:56.154 --> 00:07:57.925\nCSConferencingpolicy.\n\n134\n00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:05.241\nAnd I not.\n\n135\n00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.670\nI can't spell, that's again my fault.\n\n136\n00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.310\nWhy is that not working?\n\n137\n00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.970\nIt's 'cuz I can't spell.\n\n138\n00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:15.688\nThat is me.\n\n139\n00:08:19.376 --> 00:08:24.540\n[LAUGH] I can't tell you how many times\nI have really made a mess of that.\n\n140\n00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.450\nWhat we're looking for though,\nin this entire list of policies,\n\n141\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.340\nis what's actually been set up for\naudio and video.\n\n142\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.380\nAnd if I take a look at this\nparticular setting, it is underneath\n\n143\n00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.640\none of these that says allow and\nit's gonna be, let's see if I can find it.\n\n144\n00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.780\nIP, now there it is it's\nright at the top of the list,\n\n145\n00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.760\nI didn't actually see this here.\n\n146\n00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:54.030\nSo, when I take a look it says allow IP\naudio and allow IP video, remember that\n\n147\n00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.170\nif you're not familiar with networking,\nmost of you all probably will be.\n\n148\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.750\nIP is pretty much though, the protocol\nthat we use for networking, okay?\n\n149\n00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.730\nSo, saying allow networking\naudio to go across,\n\n150\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.460\nallow networking videoing to go across,\nthis type of network.\n\n151\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.010\nAnd it is setup to be true, so it does,\n\n152\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.250\nat least like all policies says, it's\nenabled you don't have to worry about it.\n\n153\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.030\nAnd that's pretty much\nthe key that we have.\n\n154\n00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.800\nIf you want to adjust some other things,\nyou still can, if you choose to.\n\n155\n00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.392\nNow, you really have to be a little bit\nbetter at understanding what all these\n\n156\n00:09:26.392 --> 00:09:30.633\nsettings are really about,\nlike the audio bit rate and kilobits here,\n\n157\n00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:33.758\nas well as the audio bit rate,\nor the video bit rate.\n\n158\n00:09:33.758 --> 00:09:40.190\nAnd even the app sharing bit rate, file\ntransfer, total received video bit rate.\n\n159\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.440\nI don't really know what all those\nsettings are for, so what am I gonna do?\n\n160\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.800\nI'm gonna leave them at the default cuz\nI'm assuming that Skype for business'.\n\n161\n00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.220\nWell I left them at a default\nthat's pretty good for\n\n162\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.410\njust about everybody that's out there.\n\n163\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.440\nBut if you need to change\nit because of one reason,\n\n164\n00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.990\nyou can also enable that as well.\n\n165\n00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.049\nNow, there's also of\ncourse the ability for\n\n166\n00:09:59.049 --> 00:10:03.329\nyou to go in and set up the max\nvideo conference resolution too.\n\n167\n00:10:03.329 --> 00:10:09.671\nNow, this one is set up for VGA which,\nif I remember correctly, is 640 by 480.\n\n168\n00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:13.250\nKind of a little tiny\nscreen when we see that.\n\n169\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.120\nBut you might actually want it to set\nup for a higher high-def resolution and\n\n170\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.410\nthat's what we talked about for HD video.\n\n171\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.680\nSo here's the default.\n\n172\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.430\nIf you wanted to, you could go in\nthere and probably set it up for\n\n173\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.480\nthe 1920 by 1080, a nice sizeable\nresolution, if you want to as well.\n\n174\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.300\nSo, just kinda realize\nthat this is the settings\n\n175\n00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.270\nthat you really want to be able to do.\n\n176\n00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.740\nSo, by taking look,\nif I wanted to change those audio and\n\n177\n00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.820\nvideo settings then,\nit is as simple as if I type in.\n\n178\n00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.000\nThis time, I'm gonna use the word set,\ncause that's messed up so\n\n179\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.330\nmany time, actually during\nthis little miniseries for me.\n\n180\n00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:56.610\nIf I want to change that,\nis gonna be the conference policy.\n\n181\n00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:04.950\nI'm gonna set it up for my entire\norganizations global conference policy.\n\n182\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:11.620\nAnd then where it says Allow,\noops, AllowIPAudio.\n\n183\n00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.380\nInstead, I can set this one up for\nlet's say I wanna allow that, okay?\n\n184\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.460\nAudio I want to allow, but video I don't.\n\n185\n00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:26.260\nWell, I could just do this,\nIPVideo $False.\n\n186\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.260\nIt can't be changed of course,\nwithout desired policy attributes.\n\n187\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.450\nSo, it doesn't really want me changing\nanything that's actually not been changed\n\n188\n00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.500\nso far.\n\n189\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.710\nSo, at this particular point, let's see.\n\n190\n00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.830\nIt will impact which users\nare allowed to sign the policies.\n\n191\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.740\nSo, this one's saying look, you've\ngot some already set up a little bit\n\n192\n00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.110\ndifferently, so\ndon't actually override anything,\n\n193\n00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.530\nbecause in the middle of this,\nit can change stuff right away.\n\n194\n00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.030\nBut that's what you would end up\ndoing as you would end up typing\n\n195\n00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.330\nin the actual policy there.\n\n196\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.020\nSo, it's not really wanting me to\nmess with it while it's actually\n\n197\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.040\nactive right now.\n\n198\n00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.340\nAnd I'm logged in as Joey,\n\n199\n00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.460\nso saying, make sure everything is\nkind of set up a little bit less here.\n\n200\n00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.030\nIn that way, then apply, it will impact.\n\n201\n00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:17.320\nWhat users allow to assign the policy\nas well, so we'll not mess\n\n202\n00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.380\nwith it just in case it actually is gonna\nbe in use in the future for another show.\n\n203\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.220\nBut those are the ways and\n\n204\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.890\nthe settings that you will\nhave in place as you do that.\n\n205\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:33.210\nNow once we get that particular policy\nset up and done, you can do it from here.\n\n206\n00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.808\nOr you gonna do it from the GUI interface,\none at a time.\n\n207\n00:12:36.808 --> 00:12:39.430\nAnd that's prime more of\nthe liking of what people\n\n208\n00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.860\nare going to choose to do this.\n\n209\n00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.600\nWell, the second policy then, let me\nclear off the screen of all that red,\n\n210\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.280\nis the other one that\nwe need to take a look.\n\n211\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.320\nSo, let me select again.\n\n212\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:56.650\nWhich is not, well let's see if I\ncan get to the users there, okay,\n\n213\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:03.740\nis this unusual check mark right here,\nrecord conversations and meetings.\n\n214\n00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.680\nWhen you set up a conference call,\nusually if you're the one setting it up,\n\n215\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.500\nyou do have that ability\nto record the conversation.\n\n216\n00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.460\nAnd whatever documents are also sent\nacross and everything else too.\n\n217\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.740\nIf you wanna make sure\nthat that doesn't happen,\n\n218\n00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:24.670\nyou simply uncheck that for that user and\nthey won't be able to do this.\n\n219\n00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.570\nNow, in that particular group though,\n\n220\n00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.650\nokay, what about all the other\npeople that are attending?\n\n221\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.960\nWill they be able to do so?\n\n222\n00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.810\nWell, it's possible, right,\nif all of them have it set consistently.\n\n223\n00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.410\nThey may still have the ability to do so.\n\n224\n00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.370\nExternal users sometimes may also\nhave the ability to do this as well,\n\n225\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.550\ndepending on how things are set up.\n\n226\n00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.230\nThe great thing is that once\nyou actually have this here,\n\n227\n00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.490\nit is going back to the same location.\n\n228\n00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.570\nLet me zoom back out.\n\n229\n00:13:55.010 --> 00:14:00.020\nAnd if we get that same policy again,\ncs, and\n\n230\n00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.200\nI'm just gonna show you the settings cuz\nmore than likely it's probably saying\n\n231\n00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.286\nRonnie you're about to mess\nwith stuff that you shouldn't.\n\n232\n00:14:05.286 --> 00:14:11.168\nConferencing policy here,\n\n233\n00:14:11.168 --> 00:14:14.420\nidentity Global,\n\n234\n00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:20.350\nand what we're looking for,\nmake sure I tell you to write here,\n\n235\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:26.510\nis going to be the allow\nconference recording.\n\n236\n00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:31.230\nSo, if I take a look, I need to\nscroll down and see if I can find it.\n\n237\n00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.060\nAllow.\n\n238\n00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:36.940\nAllow conference recording.\n\n239\n00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.790\nIt is here, I just had to find\nits particular, there it is.\n\n240\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.520\nI had to be able to find it, and\n\n241\n00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.660\nyou can see right now where\nit's set to false, okay?\n\n242\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.750\nSo, this one globally is saying, and\n\n243\n00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:54.370\nwe don't really have that, but enabling\nit as an individual, you can do it.\n\n244\n00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.760\nSo we can try and let's see if it\nactually spits out red all over me again.\n\n245\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.380\nAnd see if it's actually affecting.\n\n246\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.790\nIt might say, hey Ronnie,\nyou're affecting something that\n\n247\n00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.510\nmay affect somebody that's\nalready got this thing set up.\n\n248\n00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.318\nSo, let's see if globally allow.\n\n249\n00:15:15.245 --> 00:15:18.750\nConference recording.\n\n250\n00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.220\nAnd we'll set this one to true instead.\n\n251\n00:15:23.411 --> 00:15:26.102\nThat one actually did take it so\nthat's good.\n\n252\n00:15:26.102 --> 00:15:28.949\nget cs.\n\n253\n00:15:31.574 --> 00:15:35.230\nConferencing policy.\n\n254\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.080\nThis gonna spit out everybody's in it.\n\n255\n00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.140\nLet me do that.\n\n256\n00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.490\nThere's a lot more there than we think.\n\n257\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:45.280\nI need to limit it to global.\n\n258\n00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.723\nThere we go, and there we are.\n\n259\n00:15:49.723 --> 00:15:55.020\nSo, this one is now set to True, so\nwe can enable that for our users as well.\n\n260\n00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.696\nSo, that recording the meetings\nhere You can control\n\n261\n00:15:58.696 --> 00:16:01.234\nthat right here very easily as well.\n\n262\n00:16:01.234 --> 00:16:05.624\nSo, getting all that information in,\nmaking sure we understand these services,\n\n263\n00:16:05.624 --> 00:16:08.150\nhow to set it up is also another part.\n\n264\n00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.910\nNow, the last one that we want\nto take a look at for this\n\n265\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:18.270\nlittle segment here, episode is, let's see\nlet's make sure I'm telling you right,\n\n266\n00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.890\nwhich is the external communications.\n\n267\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:26.160\nOver on the left-hand side of each user\nnotice there are external communications.\n\n268\n00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.695\nNow on this one,\nit is just a simple checkbox.\n\n269\n00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:34.940\nNow you might be wondering when\ndo we actually want to allow for\n\n270\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.510\nconnections to external users or\nnot, okay?\n\n271\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:43.226\nIf you have users inside of your Office\n365 organization that are with two\n\n272\n00:16:43.226 --> 00:16:45.001\ndifferent domains, okay?\n\n273\n00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:48.620\nSo for example,\nlet's say that, well actually,\n\n274\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.330\nright here's actually\na good example as well.\n\n275\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.910\nSo I have the Office Pro Demo Co-account\n\n276\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.000\nthat I've been using\nthroughout this series.\n\n277\n00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.398\nBut I also, in a previous episode at some\npoint, I'd added in a second domain.\n\n278\n00:17:01.398 --> 00:17:03.804\nITProTVdemo.net.\n\n279\n00:17:03.804 --> 00:17:07.320\nIf I had some users that\nwere on ITProTVdemo.net,\n\n280\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.980\nsome in the officeprodemocode domain, and\n\n281\n00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.070\nI wanted them to be able to use Skype to\ncommunicate, I would need to do this.\n\n282\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.350\nSo even though it's in\nthe same organization,\n\n283\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.450\nit would still be in\na different domain name.\n\n284\n00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.550\nSo we wanna make sure that we do that.\n\n285\n00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:27.230\nIf we also have people that are using\nSkype for Business to of course contact\n\n286\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:32.090\nothers outside of the organization\nas well using, well, Skype for\n\n287\n00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:36.900\nBusiness, then we would want to enable\nthis idea of external Skype for\n\n288\n00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.830\nBusiness users too, okay?\n\n289\n00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.170\nNow, this one has two options, though.\n\n290\n00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.440\nNotice that one says, for\nSkype for Business users, and then,\n\n291\n00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.550\nExternal Skype users.\n\n292\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.280\nWell, the difference here is, this is,\nprobably, the home version, right?\n\n293\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.770\nThe one that people download, and\ngo, look, Skype, I can do this.\n\n294\n00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:58.657\nThis one's, normally for the organization,\nor the Office 365 organization instead.\n\n295\n00:17:58.657 --> 00:18:00.330\nSo it actually allows for\n\n296\n00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.760\nboth to be able to go if you want\nto be able to do that as well.\n\n297\n00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:09.760\nThe other thing too and this is something\nthat I don't if it's strange or\n\n298\n00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.650\nnot, the wording of it from Microsoft\nto me is a little bit unusual.\n\n299\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.424\nIf by chance,\nyou want an external Skype for\n\n300\n00:18:18.424 --> 00:18:23.803\nBusiness user to be able to find you\nsimply by your email address and\n\n301\n00:18:23.803 --> 00:18:28.433\nconnect to you from Skype,\nthen you have to enable this.\n\n302\n00:18:28.433 --> 00:18:32.010\nSo instead of me saying,\nhere's my Skype ID,\n\n303\n00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:37.055\nmy Skype connection that you need,\nZach, you should just be able\n\n304\n00:18:37.055 --> 00:18:42.493\nto give me if somebody in different\norganization your email address.\n\n305\n00:18:42.493 --> 00:18:45.470\nAnd I should be able to find it in Skype,\nokay?\n\n306\n00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.950\nSo if that is something that\nwe wanted to connect on or\n\n307\n00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:53.330\nsomebody else want it connect on, if I\nneed that happen in my organization to\n\n308\n00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.850\nmake it easy for people, then I also\nneed this checkmark on as well.\n\n309\n00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:02.210\nSo all of those situations are pretty\nmuch kind of very generic situation.\n\n310\n00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.550\nBut they are good reasons, and normally,\nis on here by default anyways.\n\n311\n00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.670\nIf you're never gonna connect outside\nof your own organization using Skype,\n\n312\n00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.070\nthen turn it off.\n\n313\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.310\nThere's no reason for you to have this on.\n\n314\n00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.140\nBut if there is a chance\nthat you're gonna do that,\n\n315\n00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.920\nthen that's probably a pretty good\nchance that that's gonna happen.\n\n316\n00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.935\nWell, make sure you have this setting\non and you'll be ready to go.\n\n317\n00:19:23.935 --> 00:19:28.903\nSo thinking about the idea of\nthe recording of the conferences,\n\n318\n00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:33.503\nas well as being able to set up\nthe audio and video settings,\n\n319\n00:19:33.503 --> 00:19:36.079\nagain simple checkmarks there.\n\n320\n00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:41.027\nBut those are kinda the additional\nservices that end users themselves need\n\n321\n00:19:41.027 --> 00:19:42.920\nto have ready to go.\n\n322\n00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.780\nNow, is that all that there is to Skype?\n\n323\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.240\nNo, there's tons of other things.\n\n324\n00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.365\nBut for the exam purposes, especially,\n\n325\n00:19:49.365 --> 00:19:52.231\nthose are the ones that\nthey're really focusing in on.\n\n326\n00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:55.929\nMaking sure you understand whether you\nturn it on, whether you turn it off.\n\n327\n00:19:55.929 --> 00:19:58.820\nMaking sure you understand some\nof the settings that are there.\n\n328\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.110\nWe've showed you just about everything\nthat we can show you right there\n\n329\n00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.640\nto make sure that you have at\nleast a comparable understanding\n\n330\n00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.010\nof what you might need to do for\nyour organization.\n\n331\n00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.440\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, thanks very much.\n\n332\n00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.171\nThanks for watching Configure with\nSkype End-User Settings Part 3.\n\n333\n00:20:12.171 --> 00:20:16.178\nIf you haven't watched Part 1 and\n2, you really wanna watch that.\n\n334\n00:20:16.178 --> 00:20:18.220\nAnd I

00:00:08.421\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:12.150\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.110\nHello, and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.840\nI'm your host, Jack Menace, as we\ncontinue to enable Office 365 services.\n\n7\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.770\nAnd, with us is Ronnie Wong, as usual.\n\n8\n00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.270\nHey, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.140\n&gt;&gt; How are you doing, Zach?\n\n10\n00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.883\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:30.483\nAnd today, we're going to be\ndiscussing managing anti-malware, and\n\n12\n00:00:30.483 --> 00:00:31.670\nanti-spam policies.\n\n13\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.800\nIs that correct?\n\n14\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.630\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n15\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.445\nThat is the topic that we\nare going to take a look at today.\n\n16\n00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:40.425\nWe've got to realize,\nespecially in where we are,\n\n17\n00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:43.953\nwe're kind of in the second\npart of the first,\n\n18\n00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:48.212\nactually the second decade\nof the 21st century here.\n\n19\n00:00:48.212 --> 00:00:50.997\nAnd more and more,\nas we're getting connected,\n\n20\n00:00:50.997 --> 00:00:55.460\nwe've got to worry about things, because\nthe Internet is still the Wild West.\n\n21\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.030\nWe are still connected.\n\n22\n00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.323\nWe still have to worry about\nthings like antivirus, as well.\n\n23\n00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:05.045\nBut today, anti-malware, because it\ncomes in so many different forms, and\n\n24\n00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:09.440\nspam is a big part of it that\nend-users really do neglect.\n\n25\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.564\nWhy, because, they'll click on every\nsingle link that's sent to them that says,\n\n26\n00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:14.422\nyou have a chance of winning a prize or\nsomething.\n\n27\n00:01:14.422 --> 00:01:17.767\nOr here's a bill and, you're like,\nI didn't buy anything, and\n\n28\n00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:19.035\nthey'll click on that.\n\n29\n00:01:19.035 --> 00:01:21.281\nAnd they'll actually get more and\n\n30\n00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:24.850\nmore spam that comes in their\ninbox than they realize.\n\n31\n00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.061\nSo these things for the end-user is really\nsomething that we have to worry about,\n\n32\n00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:31.075\nfrom the end user's perspective, and\n\n33\n00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:35.370\nit's something that we want to make sure\nthat we understand and talk about as well.\n\n34\n00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.884\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, do we still have\nto worry about malware and spam,\n\n35\n00:01:38.884 --> 00:01:41.464\neven though we have\neverything in the cloud?\n\n36\n00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:46.750\n&gt;&gt; To a point, that actually is\na great kind of thought here, right?\n\n37\n00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.362\nIf all my services and\nmy servers are hosted into the cloud,\n\n38\n00:01:50.362 --> 00:01:55.506\nwhat do I really have to worry about in\nterms of of anti-malware and anti-spyware?\n\n39\n00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:57.512\nThere are some things, right.\n\n40\n00:01:57.512 --> 00:02:02.102\nIf you're hosting a private cloud, you\nstill have the same considerations as you\n\n41\n00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:06.760\ndo such as on a personal machine, where\nyou have to get whatever your anti-malware\n\n42\n00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.485\nis going to be, and set up those\npolicies on your email server, and\n\n43\n00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:13.704\ndo all that stuff and\nmake sure that everything is set up.\n\n44\n00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:18.761\nOnce everything is in the cloud though,\nOffice 365 Microsoft guys have said,\n\n45\n00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:23.543\nlook we're gonna worry about this, so\nlet's go ahead and just do this here.\n\n46\n00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:26.771\nIs that,\nwe'll kind of provide the protection, and\n\n47\n00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:31.578\nwhat you need to worry about, Ronnie,\nis configuring it for your organisation\n\n48\n00:02:31.578 --> 00:02:36.990\nto make it actually fit the policies that\nyou want it to fit in and to make it work.\n\n49\n00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.350\nAnd, that's kind of where we are,\nyou and I.\n\n50\n00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.789\nWe're not gonna be able to do this, Zach.\n\n51\n00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.390\nWe're not gonna be able to go out to\na brick and motor store and go, look.\n\n52\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.431\nIt says the best anti-virus on the planet,\nand\n\n53\n00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:48.582\ninstall it into our\nOffice 365 organization.\n\n54\n00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:51.850\nThey're not just gonna let us do that.\n\n55\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.068\nIt's just not gonna happen.\n\n56\n00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:54.960\nBut, their stuff that they've tested,\n\n57\n00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.042\nthat they've proven that they've\ndone everything that they can,\n\n58\n00:02:58.042 --> 00:03:02.530\nthey're saying, we're already running\nthat essentially on their infrastructure.\n\n59\n00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.251\nBut now, there are some configuration\nissues that need to be taken care of.\n\n60\n00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:11.151\nAnd, that's when we start addressing what\nwe call the different policies that are up\n\n61\n00:03:11.151 --> 00:03:12.250\nin Office 365.\n\n62\n00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.695\nEssentially saying,\n\n63\n00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:18.110\nlet's apply what we're actually\ngiven as tools to make it work out.\n\n64\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.710\nOkay, so that is what we're\nreally talking about too.\n\n65\n00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.960\nSo, when it comes down to\nessentially emails right now,\n\n66\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.030\nmost of us are kind of\nhovering around our inbox,\n\n67\n00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.550\nbecause it is the communication system\nof just about everything that we do,\n\n68\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.880\nespecially inside a business.\n\n69\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.747\nIt is the pathway.\n\n70\n00:03:38.747 --> 00:03:41.362\nIt is pretty much the blood,\nif you want to,\n\n71\n00:03:41.362 --> 00:03:45.220\nof most companies that really\nmakes everything work.\n\n72\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.260\nWell, when you take a look at your inbox,\nyou might get a ton of e-mails in there.\n\n73\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.933\nBut, some of us might still be\nsorting out, like saying, that's spam.\n\n74\n00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.590\nWhy did that get through?\n\n75\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.316\nWhat's happening there?\n\n76\n00:03:56.316 --> 00:04:01.350\nAnd, that's because the volume of spam\nhas continued to increase over time.\n\n77\n00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.326\nSo much so, that it wasn't long ago,\nand, I say it wasn't long ago.\n\n78\n00:04:05.326 --> 00:04:10.969\nIt was probably five, six, maybe even\nten years ago, where they were saying,\n\n79\n00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.686\nlook, when you think about it,\n90% of all emails, not just for\n\n80\n00:04:15.686 --> 00:04:21.100\nbusinesses, but every single email\nthat's out there, is probably spam.\n\n81\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.488\nAnd, in 2015, or early 2016, I believe,\nSymantec said 1 in every 183 emails Or\n\n82\n00:04:25.488 --> 00:04:28.058\n163, one of those two numbers,\nis probably spam.\n\n83\n00:04:28.058 --> 00:04:32.730\nSo, the more that you think about it,\none in every 160,\n\n84\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.853\n150 emails is more than\nlikely some type of spam.\n\n85\n00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:41.339\nThat's a lot of time that somebody working\nfor an organization has to filter out,\n\n86\n00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:44.524\nwhether it's you doing it at\nthe beginning of the day, and\n\n87\n00:04:44.524 --> 00:04:46.409\nyou're clearing out your inbox,\n\n88\n00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:51.250\nor whether it's a system in the background\nthat they've paid a ton of money for.\n\n89\n00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.870\nSo, we're gonna set up these filters.\n\n90\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.120\nWe're gonna do all this and\nmake sure that it works.\n\n91\n00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.223\nSomebody had to take the time to\nconfigure that and make it happen, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:58.223 --> 00:05:02.690\nSo the great thing is once this stuff\nis configured, it works well, but\n\n93\n00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.779\nit's still actually having to do all those\nsystems and get everything in place.\n\n94\n00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:10.860\nAnd there's still some things that\nend up slipping through the cracks.\n\n95\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.993\nAnd that's what we wanna\ntalk about right now,\n\n96\n00:05:13.993 --> 00:05:18.846\nis that there is this idea that ends\nup happening, especially with spam,\n\n97\n00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:22.960\nthat we can get what are called\nfalse positives, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.630\nSo, when we start to do that,\nwhat the heck is a false positive?\n\n99\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.460\nIt's when an email gets flagged as spam,\neven though the it's not really spam.\n\n100\n00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.150\nAnd that can happen for\nmany, many reasons.\n\n101\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.432\nIt just depends on how\nthe system is set up.\n\n102\n00:05:36.432 --> 00:05:42.050\nWell, your organization though,\nit can treat spam in different ways, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.045\nSo some organizations have it where if\nspam comes into the business itself,\n\n104\n00:05:48.045 --> 00:05:53.113\nwhat will end up happening is that\nit will get content filtered.\n\n105\n00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:57.080\nIn other words it looks and\ngoes this is spam, or this isn't spam.\n\n106\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.212\nAnd then, it will judge that idea and\nit will either delete the entire email\n\n107\n00:06:01.212 --> 00:06:04.829\nnotice, and you won't even see it,\nwhich sounds great, okay.\n\n108\n00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:10.395\nOr it will maybe shuffle it off\ninto a junk mail inbox for you.\n\n109\n00:06:10.395 --> 00:06:13.461\nIt's something that just goes there and\nyou've probably seen it,\n\n110\n00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:16.740\neven if you have just a regular Gmail\naccount or anything else out there,\n\n111\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.105\nwhere you get a junk mail folder, and\nit's full of junk mail, of course.\n\n112\n00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:26.478\nOr some organizations will actually send\nit and have it quarantined for a while.\n\n113\n00:06:26.478 --> 00:06:31.633\nAnd that idea of the quarantine says,\nlet me shuffle it off someplace that\n\n114\n00:06:31.633 --> 00:06:36.703\nthen it can be examined, if we want to,\nbut then we can choose to either,\n\n115\n00:06:36.703 --> 00:06:42.550\nat that point, delete it, or we can\nchoose to forward it on to whoever it is.\n\n116\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.650\nSo, this can happen every once in\na while to an organization and\n\n117\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.110\nthe way that we actually start\nsetting up some of these policies and\n\n118\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.790\nthese filters that are in place,\nis that either we're too lax\n\n119\n00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.600\nand we're getting so much junk mail coming\nthrough, so we harden down on the policy.\n\n120\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.187\nAnd we make it so\nstrict that now, at this point,\n\n121\n00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:10.787\nif I'm dependent on emails and a phone for\nmy living, like sales really is,\n\n122\n00:07:10.787 --> 00:07:16.581\nI may now get a little bit paranoid\nsaying, Zach, you've cut off something.\n\n123\n00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:21.353\nBecause I was expecting this email, and\nI'm not getting any emails at all anymore.\n\n124\n00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:23.986\nOr I'm getting a lot less than I used to,\nand\n\n125\n00:07:23.986 --> 00:07:27.270\nnow I'm worried that it got\ncaught in the spam filter.\n\n126\n00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.790\nAnd, did the spam filter delete it when\nit was a really important email for me?\n\n127\n00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.452\nWell, now you've gotta\nkind of deal with that.\n\n128\n00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:36.770\nSo there has to be a balance in there,\nokay.\n\n129\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.470\nSo the great thing is, in those systems\nin which you do have a quarantine system,\n\n130\n00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.430\nyou also then have too have some\ntype of release of that quarantine\n\n131\n00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.350\nto make it work.\n\n132\n00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.550\nSo you can't, you can, I guess.\n\n133\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.044\nYou can actually quarantine everything and\ngo, I'm never gonna release these emails.\n\n134\n00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:57.012\nBut it really is up to you then,\nat that point, to actually say, all right,\n\n135\n00:07:57.012 --> 00:08:00.869\nhow do we actually get this to work and\nhow do we get those emails released?\n\n136\n00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:04.589\nAnd that is kind of the first topic that\nwe're talking about is making sure that we\n\n137\n00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:08.140\nunderstand the idea of releasing\nsomething from quarantine.\n\n138\n00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.020\nNow, I've gone ahead and\nset this thing up for\n\n139\n00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:16.570\nus to at least be able to see an example\nof a quarantine message that gives that.\n\n140\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.730\nBut before we can actually go on to\ndo that we do have to kind of see and\n\n141\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.900\nthem understand that it's a process,\nright?\n\n142\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.390\nThere's not exactly an easy thing that\njust says, yeah I just click on here and\n\n143\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.710\neverything is going on.\n\n144\n00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.460\nThere's decisions that need to be made and\nyou have to understand some of the basics\n\n145\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.690\nof how the system ends up working\nbefore everything comes in.\n\n146\n00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.290\nBut let's go and\nat least show you at the beginning here\n\n147\n00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.950\nwhen you do have something\ninside the quarantine and\n\n148\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.170\nyou need to release it,\nhow do you go about doing that?\n\n149\n00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.910\nSo, I'm back in the Office Admin center,\nand\n\n150\n00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.540\nI'm going to head to\nthe Exchange Admin center.\n\n151\n00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.540\nSo, down on the lower-left hand corner\nI'm gonna select the Admin center's icon,\n\n152\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.040\nthen select Exchange.\n\n153\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.520\nOnce I'm actually within the Exchange\nCenter here, there's actually a couple of\n\n154\n00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.250\nways we can get this, and this actually\nbrings up a good point, is that.\n\n155\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.330\nSo, I'll show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n156\n00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.950\nNow, if you can actually go\ninto the Exchange Center,\n\n157\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:19.620\nI can select Protection and\ninside of protection,\n\n158\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.590\nyou can see that there's a category\nright here called quarantine.\n\n159\n00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.690\nAnd inside the quarantine, we should\nsee that there should be an email or\n\n160\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.870\ntwo that I've actually,\nthat I did a little bit earlier.\n\n161\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.710\nSo that we could see it happen as well.\n\n162\n00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.844\nSo, right there there\nare these two emails.\n\n163\n00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:41.090\nNow if I wanted to make sure that\nI've got this ready to go here,\n\n164\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:47.840\nall right, so, here is a piece of\nspam that I received in my own inbox.\n\n165\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.220\nWhat I'm going to do is, I'm gonna to\nforward this to Joey, is what I'm going to\n\n166\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.710\ndo, and I'm gonna send it along,\nwell at least I think I'm sending it.\n\n167\n00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.720\nThere, so we'll give it a moment here\nto just send along and, you know,\n\n168\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.980\ndo the stuff that it needs to do here.\n\n169\n00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.380\nOr it's gonna lock up my computer.\n\n170\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.850\nOne of the two things is\ngoing to end up happening.\n\n171\n00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.960\nSo, I'm hoping it didn't\nlock up the computer.\n\n172\n00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.120\nLet's do that.\n\n173\n00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.200\nAll right, so\nhere we're just gonna let it do its thing.\n\n174\n00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.220\nAnd hopefully another piece is\ngonna end up coming in here\n\n175\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.780\nbecause of what I've done.\n\n176\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.530\nSo here are some of the messages.\n\n177\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.460\nThe great thing is fairly easily I\ncan select one of these messages, and\n\n178\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.900\nthen there's a little envelope right here.\n\n179\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.540\nAnd if I hover over that envelope,\nlook at that, Release Message.\n\n180\n00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.770\nIt is not difficult at all, but this is\nwhere it gets a little bit confusing too.\n\n181\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.320\nBut we're not really focusing on\nthe power shell at this point,\n\n182\n00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.900\nbecause this is actually actions where\n\n183\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.000\nyou're probably not going to be able\nto do this in power shell in bulk,\n\n184\n00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.850\nbecause you're really having to go through\neach one of these emails to do this.\n\n185\n00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.990\nThere is a release all that\nyou can do which is saying hey\n\n186\n00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.640\nrelease every single one of them.\n\n187\n00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.460\nBut if you do that, that means you've\ninspected every single one of these\n\n188\n00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.990\nmessages and more than likely\nmost of us haven't done that.\n\n189\n00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.800\nSo, we can get to it from right\nhere inside of protection.\n\n190\n00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.610\nBut there is another way, and this is\nprobably the way that is a little bit more\n\n191\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:21.380\nin line with what you'll probably\nsee as far as security settings go,\n\n192\n00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.060\nis that we go back to the admin center\nsecurity and compliance system.\n\n193\n00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.760\nAnd inside the security and compliance\n\n194\n00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:37.880\nI'm going to select, let me make sure\nhere, I believe away it's not on the back\n\n195\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:45.180\nit's under I thought I was\nunder threat management.\n\n196\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.125\nLet me make sure, yup.\n\n197\n00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:47.490\nIt said, threat management.\n\n198\n00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.040\nThere it is.\n\n199\n00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.400\nI was looking for the word, quarantine,\nand I just didn't scroll down.\n\n200\n00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.380\nQuarantine should be here,\nbut I am not seeing it.\n\n201\n00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.190\nSo, if I select quarantine.\n\n202\n00:12:01.335 --> 00:12:05.444\nAnd you'll see right here, it shows\na little bit of a different view but\n\n203\n00:12:05.444 --> 00:12:08.801\nthere is the third one that I\njust forwarded right here, so\n\n204\n00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:12.270\nthat we can see this piece\nof spam come in as well.\n\n205\n00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.454\nIt's from here too,\nthat what I can do is I can select one and\n\n206\n00:12:16.454 --> 00:12:22.259\nnotice over here on the right hand side, I\ncan do a release or a release and report.\n\n207\n00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:25.439\nAnd releasing a report is exactly like\nit's something like go and do it, but\n\n208\n00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:28.471\nmake sure you send someone a message\nthat this has been done too that it has\n\n209\n00:12:28.471 --> 00:12:30.840\nactually been released from quarantine.\n\n210\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.850\nSo you may have a management\nsystem that allows you to do that.\n\n211\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.440\nSo each way that you actually chose to\ndo it they're both valid to do this and\n\n212\n00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.710\nI wish I could tell you that this way is\nvalid on the exam and this way isn't.\n\n213\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.030\nI can't, I really can't.\n\n214\n00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.480\nSo, you need to know about both\noptions that are available to you\n\n215\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.940\nbecause they might ask\nyou about one of them and\n\n216\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.210\nI just don't know which one\nthat they might ask you about.\n\n217\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.250\nSo, make sure you pay attention and\nrealize that that is exactly what can\n\n218\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:04.170\nhappen fairly easy enough if we select\nlet's say the message from Vaughan.\n\n219\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.990\nAnd then I come up here to release,\nand I just select that one.\n\n220\n00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:14.010\nNow, you'll notice that we have a couple\nof options that are available, right?\n\n221\n00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.800\nSo, this one is to Vonn, but notice\nit doesn't show me who it's sent to.\n\n222\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.200\nIf it doesn't show me who it's sent to,\nI've got an option here, right.\n\n223\n00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.950\nAm I releasing the message\nto all recipients?\n\n224\n00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.720\nWell this is where you have to be careful.\n\n225\n00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.940\nIf this is really spam, we could literally\nspam everybody in our organization,\n\n226\n00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.840\nbecause that list can be gigantic.\n\n227\n00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.360\nOr, do I only want to release\nit to a specific recipient?\n\n228\n00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.820\nAnd you'll see right here, that at least\none person that lists is right here.\n\n229\n00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.780\nNow, if there were a list and\nthere were 100's.\n\n230\n00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.010\nWell, you could do that where you actually\ncome in and select this, but he's the only\n\n231\n00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.530\none, and then from that point you\nsubmit that and it would be released.\n\n232\n00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:57.700\nI'm not gonna worry about releasing\nthat because it doesn't really matter,\n\n233\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.740\nwhether it actually goes.\n\n234\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:04.310\nBut that's kind of some of the set up\nthat we have to be able to understand and\n\n235\n00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.250\ndo, from that quarantine,\n\n236\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.710\nis to get a quarantine message\nout of there if we need to.\n\n237\n00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.400\nThe other thing of course then is,\n\n238\n00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.780\nwell how the heck do you\nknow what to quarantine?\n\n239\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.440\nOkay, and\nthat's pretty much a good thing for\n\n240\n00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.640\nus to also spend a little bit of time and\nfocus on.\n\n241\n00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.630\nAnd that is when we start configuring\nthe idea of spam settings\n\n242\n00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.770\ninside of the Exchange settings.\n\n243\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.190\nSo, let's go back to Exchange Online.\n\n244\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.260\nSo, here it is,\nI'm switching over to the Exchange Online.\n\n245\n00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.790\nAnd, once we get into Exchange Online,\nwe are going to select Protection,\n\n246\n00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.880\nover on the left-hand side.\n\n247\n00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.855\nNotice across the top.\n\n248\n00:14:44.855 --> 00:14:46.784\nWell, we have several filters and\n\n249\n00:14:46.784 --> 00:14:50.584\nthis is that protection mechanism\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n250\n00:14:50.584 --> 00:14:55.680\nAnti-malware is essentially a filter that\nsays filter out this type of malware.\n\n251\n00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.130\nThe idea of anti-spam,\nlook at that, Spam Filter.\n\n252\n00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.970\nSo, we have those two options and notice\nthat there's a default policy set up here.\n\n253\n00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.340\nWe're not gonna really spend too much time\nin the anti-malware filter for right now.\n\n254\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.820\nBut we want this spam filter,\n\n255\n00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:17.280\nbecause I want to show you the idea of\nhow this test actually worked out for us.\n\n256\n00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.960\nSo, I created one, a little bit earlier,\ncalled test filter, is what I did.\n\n257\n00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.570\nAnd when I did that, all I had to\ndo was click on the plus sign, and\n\n258\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:28.910\nthat added in this policy.\n\n259\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:35.760\nSo, we'll call this one test\nfilter number two, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.810\nNot real creative today,\nthat is what you'll see.\n\n261\n00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:43.120\nBut there's a few actions that you want\nto make sure that you pay attention to,\n\n262\n00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.650\nas well as the help bubbles over here too,\nokay?\n\n263\n00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.610\nSo once you actually select\nsomething like this,\n\n264\n00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:54.950\nnotice that right away we get\ninto spam and bulk actions, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.186\nWell, what is a bulk action.\n\n266\n00:15:56.186 --> 00:15:59.701\nI mean, there is actually bulk email now\nout there that's just legitimate, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:59.701 --> 00:16:01.619\nWell what do you actually wanna do?\n\n268\n00:16:01.619 --> 00:16:04.165\nIs it spam or is it bulk actions?\n\n269\n00:16:04.165 --> 00:16:10.984\nThen we get some confusing terms right\nhere, Spam, and then High confidence spam.\n\n270\n00:16:10.984 --> 00:16:14.666\nGo figure, this is kind of\nthe extra strength stuff, isn't it?\n\n271\n00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:16.120\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n272\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.500\nIt's the process of what happens.\n\n273\n00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.450\nWhen the email comes\ninto your organization,\n\n274\n00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.960\nit gets content filtered, okay?\n\n275\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.990\nThen at that point what it\nwill do is it will get rated.\n\n276\n00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.765\nIn other words the spam will actually go\nthrough a rating system here that we call\n\n277\n00:16:30.765 --> 00:16:35.560\nan SCL, a spam confidence level,\nthat you'll end up seeing.\n\n278\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.130\nAnd technically, this number\nactually goes from a negative one\n\n279\n00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.000\nall the way up through\na nine is what it goes to.\n\n280\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.470\nSo usually when you go from negative\none all the way up to a one,\n\n281\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.700\nthat's gonna go into\nyour recipient's inbox.\n\n282\n00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.070\nIn other words, you're fairly\nconfident that is not spam, okay?\n\n283\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.230\nNegative one to one is not spam.\n\n284\n00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:03.390\nThen the scale jumps up to 5 through 9,\nand once you get into 5 through 9,\n\n285\n00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:08.280\nthough, okay, that's when it starts rating\nas being spam or high confidence spam.\n\n286\n00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.222\nAs you start heading into 9,\n\n287\n00:17:09.222 --> 00:17:12.770\nit really hot, its like,\nI guarantee you that this is spam.\n\n288\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.471\nWhen you start doing five and\nyou're saying,\n\n289\n00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:17.950\nI think it's spam but I don't know.\n\n290\n00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:18.620\nAnd it will look for\n\n291\n00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.040\nthose characteristics that most\nspam messages will have in there.\n\n292\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.823\nSo all of that is possible to actually\nset up and do and get configured.\n\n293\n00:17:26.823 --> 00:17:29.306\nNow, if you saying,\nall right Ronnie, are we doing that?\n\n294\n00:17:29.306 --> 00:17:34.374\nNo, we're not doing that and\nthat's because we have an entire\n\n295\n00:17:34.374 --> 00:17:40.890\nclass where it's 70- 345 on managing\nmaintaining a Microsoft Exchange.\n\n296\n00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.635\nThat class, well, I should go in there and\n\n297\n00:17:43.635 --> 00:17:47.580\nshow you the PowerShell\ncommand to get all that done.\n\n298\n00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:52.370\nWhat we're doing is we're deciding\non the action that we are to take.\n\n299\n00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.840\nNotice we're actually moving this,\n\n300\n00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.920\nand this one by default is moving\nit to a junk email folder, instead.\n\n301\n00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.815\nSo what does that mean?\n\n302\n00:17:59.815 --> 00:18:03.220\nThat means that when we configure\nsomething like the spam setting here,\n\n303\n00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.160\nwe actually say, all right, whatever\nthe settings are, where are those set?\n\n304\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.160\nWell, those are set up in Exchange and\nthey're the transport rules is where\n\n305\n00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.672\nthose things are set, and that way it\nknows as emails coming in to get switch.\n\n306\n00:18:15.672 --> 00:18:18.500\nFilter is there and\nsays I'm gonna mark it this way.\n\n307\n00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.650\nThis gonna have a five, here's gonna\nhave a nine, here's gonna have a one.\n\n308\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.690\nFrom that point when it takes a look\nat that and the spam it says,\n\n309\n00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.410\nall right,\nhere's what we're gonna do with it.\n\n310\n00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.630\nSo, there's an action involved where\nit's gonna actually be routed, okay?\n\n311\n00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.990\nSome of the route actually says\nlet's send it on to the user, but\n\n312\n00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.430\nwe'll send it to their junk mail.\n\n313\n00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.320\nOr you may take a little bit\nmore of an aggressive stance\n\n314\n00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.970\nwhere you guys did 365\nadministrative stance.\n\n315\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.840\nWe don't wanna send it to the user.\n\n316\n00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.440\nI want it quarantined so\n\n317\n00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:54.000\nI can see what's going on before I\nrelease it inside of my organization.\n\n318\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.630\nWell, you can actually\nset that right here.\n\n319\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.530\nSo let me show you where that's done.\n\n320\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:03.090\nI select the drop down, and this is where\nyou start seeing what can be done here.\n\n321\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:09.460\nYou can also add in some information,\nlike in the subject line,\n\n322\n00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.990\nwhere if you know that this is spam,\nyou can go ahead and\n\n323\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:16.850\nput in, right at the beginning of the\nemail that comes in and says, spam, okay?\n\n324\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.460\nRight in the subject line.\n\n325\n00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.700\nOr you can redirect it to\na particular mail address.\n\n326\n00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.680\nYou can have it delete the message here or\nquarantine the message.\n\n327\n00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.290\nThe great thing is it's easier enough\nto just select quarantine, and\n\n328\n00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.890\nthen you're fine right there.\n\n329\n00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:37.340\nIf you leave it at the default,\nthis is the one that I wanted to focus on.\n\n330\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.430\nLet me leave it at the default, and\nlet me see if I can hover over this so\n\n331\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.720\nthat we can get a setting, there we go,\nthat's the one that I want.\n\n332\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.700\nSo if we take a look at\nthe message that's right here,\n\n333\n00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.590\nthis is what you have to make sure\nthat you understand right here.\n\n334\n00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.240\nIn order for\nthis action to take place, okay?\n\n335\n00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.795\nNotice it says you must configure\ntwo Exchange transport rules on your\n\n336\n00:19:58.795 --> 00:20:05.790\non-premises servers to detect spam headers\nadded by the hosted spam filtering.\n\n337\n00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:10.410\nWell, so it seems strange enough, but\n\n338\n00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:15.280\nas an exam question, I can see somebody\nsaying, why doesn't this working?\n\n339\n00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.640\nI'm telling it to move it to my email\naddress, well, you're probably missing two\n\n340\n00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.710\nthings there which of course\nare those rules that are available.\n\n341\n00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.800\nNow we're not typing this whole thing\nout cuz it's actually pretty decent like\n\n342\n00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.070\nthree lines of a PowerShell code to\nmake everything happen here, but\n\n343\n00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.500\nyou actually see that.\n\n344\n00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.220\nWell, I'll probably have it\nin the notes somewhere, but\n\n345\n00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.250\njust kind of remember that that's what's\ngoing on when you start seeing that.\n\n346\n00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.240\nNow just when you start\nthinking that you're done,\n\n347\n00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.980\nspam takes a bit of time to actually\ngo through, in terms of the processing.\n\n348\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.220\nNotice that we can also accept or\ntake a look and\n\n349\n00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.000\nconfigure the way that bulk\nemail ends up working.\n\n350\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.080\nThen if we're gonna send\nit to a quarantine,\n\n351\n00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.730\nthough, notice the default retention\nperiod, which is 15 days, okay?\n\n352\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.370\nYou can change that, you simply just\ntake whatever number that you want to,\n\n353\n00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.150\nchange it and you're off and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n354\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.338\nI'm just gonna leave it at\ndefault of 15 for right now.\n\n355\n00:21:08.338 --> 00:21:13.470\nThe other thing that you can also do,\nis create what we call a block list,\n\n356\n00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.460\nso instead notice sender block list.\n\n357\n00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:22.220\nAlways mark the email from\nthe following sender as spam.\n\n358\n00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.603\nSo if you knew that somebody was\nactually sending you spam all the time,\n\n359\n00:21:26.603 --> 00:21:29.025\nyou could actually do that right here.\n\n360\n00:21:29.025 --> 00:21:34.003\nNow if you do that, that's a lot,\nthat becomes a huge risk especially when\n\n361\n00:21:34.003 --> 00:21:37.411\nyou start seeing how many\nemail addresses do that.\n\n362\n00:21:37.411 --> 00:21:38.840\nAnd more effectively, and\n\n363\n00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:44.730\nI literally mean more effective here,\nas you can choose a particular domain.\n\n364\n00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:49.840\nNow here's an issue though, if you\nchoose this domain block list instead,\n\n365\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.040\nthere is more, I'm gonna say as close\nas we're gonna get to 100% chance that\n\n366\n00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.750\nwe're gonna block spam from this domain.\n\n367\n00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.685\nBut you're also gonna block\nanything else from this domain too.\n\n368\n00:22:01.685 --> 00:22:04.700\nAnd once you actually put it on\nthe domain block list, it is blocked.\n\n369\n00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.047\nSo if you think that there's also\nlegitimate email coming in from that\n\n370\n00:22:09.047 --> 00:22:14.110\ndomain and there's also spam coming in\nfrom that domain, don't put it here.\n\n371\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:20.660\nThat will be pretty close to making sure\nthat you have blocked off everything.\n\n372\n00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.250\nSame thing here with allow list.\n\n373\n00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.592\nThis is now what we called the idea\nof white listed a little bit.\n\n374\n00:22:25.592 --> 00:22:26.640\nWhere we can actually say, hey,\n\n375\n00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.080\nmake sure that this sender's email will\nget through as well as this domain.\n\n376\n00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.363\nThen there's even international spam,\nwho would have thought that there we so\n\n377\n00:22:34.363 --> 00:22:35.680\nmany flavors of spam.\n\n378\n00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.180\nActually there's a lot of\nflavors of spam today.\n\n379\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.400\nBut international spam\nthat's also out there.\n\n380\n00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.050\nThis one detects it based on\nlanguage if we choose to.\n\n381\n00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.830\nSo, you can actually see all of\nthose different settings, and\n\n382\n00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.840\nthat's not even all of it.\n\n383\n00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.750\nNotice that I continue to go down through.\n\n384\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:58.730\nThere's even advanced options, what we can\nmark as spam, in terms of the content.\n\n385\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.770\nI'm not really worried about so\nmuch of this stuff because it really is so\n\n386\n00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.770\ngranular at what you\nwant to be able to do.\n\n387\n00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:06.910\nYou wanna be careful.\n\n388\n00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:11.330\nI do wanna take just a moment here, and\nnotice that there's test mode, let me see\n\n389\n00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.780\nif I can zoom in a little bit more, test\nmode options that are available, right?\n\n390\n00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:20.560\nConfiguring test mode options for\nwhen a match is made to do this.\n\n391\n00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.550\nSo if you're not sure if you really want\nto run this, but you want to test it out.\n\n392\n00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.830\nWell, this gives you\nthe chance to actually say,\n\n393\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.250\nhere's all the stuff that I want to do.\n\n394\n00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.740\nBut let me just try and\n\n395\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.910\nconfigure an email that I think is gonna\nget marked as spam, and do that, okay?\n\n396\n00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.980\nThen, you can add conditions on\nwhom it's applied to, as well.\n\n397\n00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.230\nSo you can select so\n\n398\n00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.990\nmany different conditions,\nmake sure that this is applied.\n\n399\n00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:49.610\nIf the recipient is a particular person,\ndomain or\n\n400\n00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:54.230\na member of a group, you can add in\nmultiple conditions if you want to.\n\n401\n00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.180\nYou can even add in\nexceptions to that condition.\n\n402\n00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.240\nOnce you're done with that you hit Save,\nand then you're done.\n\n403\n00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.830\nNow the reason why I'm not adding\nanything, is cuz I already configured one.\n\n404\n00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:07.665\nAnd I know this one works, because yes,\nshe did see we added another one here.\n\n405\n00:24:07.665 --> 00:24:10.520\nWell, I simply selected this and\n\n406\n00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.300\nhere's the end result after you actually\nkind of get everything in hand.\n\n407\n00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:19.270\nSo, on the bulk actions, I selected\nquarantine and I was able to get Vonne and\n\n408\n00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.700\nmyself and\nI sent an email using our accounts and\n\n409\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.280\nit sent it into the quarantined message.\n\n410\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.220\nSo, that's how I knew that it worked.\n\n411\n00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.670\nI selected Vonne here originally and\nI blocked her.\n\n412\n00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.745\nThen I took her out, made sure\nthat she could send emails again.\n\n413\n00:24:31.745 --> 00:24:33.530\nAnd she was able to.\n\n414\n00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.070\nAnd then allow list,\nif I wanted all that, but you name it.\n\n415\n00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.210\nThere is so\nmany options that are here, and\n\n416\n00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:42.500\nhere the only thing that I did as far\nas a filter goes on the applied to,\n\n417\n00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.420\nis the recipient domain when\nit was coming into my domain.\n\n418\n00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.790\nSo once I get all that set up, I test it\nout and I make sure that it's ready to go.\n\n419\n00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.780\nSo this is actually those two\nparts that we were talking about.\n\n420\n00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.820\nIf I'm gonna be able to actually\nhave something in quarantine,\n\n421\n00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:03.350\nthis is where I draw and\nput things in the quarantine from, okay?\n\n422\n00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.220\nOnce it's in the quarantine, then I can\ngo back and review whatever gets in that\n\n423\n00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:12.810\nquarantine and then select that to release\nwhat I wanted to actually release to.\n\n424\n00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:18.840\nSo it's a big part of what we have to be\nable to set up to do in terms of email,\n\n425\n00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.910\nbut once that's done, though, we have now\neffectively at least at the beginning,\n\n426\n00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:30.110\nstarted setting up an effective type of\nantimalware as well as antispam strategy.\n\n427\n00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.720\nAnd the policies that are there.\n\n428\n00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.450\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n429\n00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.300\nIt looks like we might need a part two,\nthough.\n\n430\n00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.310\n&gt;&gt; It really does, there is still a little\nbit more for us to actually cover and\n\n431\n00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.430\nthat's because I talk a lot.\n\n432\n00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:46.155\nBut yeah, we still will probably need\na part two to finish up this concept and\n\n433\n00:25:46.155 --> 00:25:47.147\nthis ideal.\n\n434\n00:25:47.147 --> 00:25:48.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's fine because\nwe enjoy listening to you.\n\n435\n00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.301\nAnd there'll be more\nmanaging antimalware and\n\n436\n00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:58.350\nantispam policies as we continue on\nwith enabling Office 365 Services.\n\n437\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.870\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n438\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.260\nI'm your host, Zach

00:00:14.022\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n4\n00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:16.510\nhelping you to learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.630\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\n\n6\n00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.563\nenabling Office 365 services as we\ncontinue to manage anti-malware and\n\n7\n00:00:22.563 --> 00:00:27.080\nanti-spam policies part two,\nwith our IT professional, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.200\nRonnie, bring us up to speed.\n\n9\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.450\nWhere are we at and where are we going?\n\n10\n00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, so since we're actually\nin the midst of a part two here,\n\n11\n00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.190\nof course means we've\nalready done a part one and\n\n12\n00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.660\nthere's a lot of information\nthat we covered there.\n\n13\n00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.540\nWe started talking about\nmanaging policies.\n\n14\n00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.680\nRemember that in Office 365.\n\n15\n00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.230\nYou and I, we really don't get to install\nantivirus software, anti-malware software\n\n16\n00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.140\nin the Office 365 itself, but they already\nhave stuff like that that's built in.\n\n17\n00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.010\nWhat we have to do as an owner\nof an organization or\n\n18\n00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.420\nas an administrator of\nan organization of course,\n\n19\n00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.170\nis to enable those types of settings and\nto make it work.\n\n20\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.380\nAnd normally, what we're really concerned\nabout, especially on the email end, of\n\n21\n00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.470\ncourse, is gonna be that idea of anti-spam\nis what we're really talking about.\n\n22\n00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.970\nSo when we start to do that,\n\n23\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.800\nwe showed you in that previous episode,\nhow to configure the spam settings.\n\n24\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.230\nSo that we can begin content filtering.\n\n25\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.165\nAnd then assigning the emails,\nessentially a spam confidence level.\n\n26\n00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:27.410\nAn SCL number, is what it does.\n\n27\n00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.770\nFrom that point,\nwe can either have it go ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.930\nforward it onto some,\na junk mail folder, or even quarantine.\n\n29\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.680\nAnd from that point, we also talked about,\nwell, once it gets into a quarantine,\n\n30\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.700\nif it's not junk mail, how do we\nget it out of the quarantine too?\n\n31\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.580\nSo we did do a lot of that information\nwhere we showed pretty much\n\n32\n00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.220\nthose settings and of course the web\nUI as well as in the PowerShell because\n\n33\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.740\nthat seems to be hitting just\nabout everything that we're doing.\n\n34\n00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.580\nAnd now we are ready for\na part two is what we're taking a look at.\n\n35\n00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.370\nSo when we start to talk about this idea,\nokay, we are now moving into\n\n36\n00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.758\nthe realm of what we call, configuring\nlist, is what we're doing, okay.\n\n37\n00:02:07.758 --> 00:02:10.680\nThis is where when we start\nto take a look at it here,\n\n38\n00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.850\nis that you might have heard the terms,\nwhitelisting and\n\n39\n00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.110\nblacklisting before Is what you\nmight have heard about, right?\n\n40\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.260\nThe idea of whitelisting is simple.\n\n41\n00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.390\nEverybody else at this point\nis pretty much denied access.\n\n42\n00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.490\nAnd then, you are simply saying,\nall right, I will give the explicit\n\n43\n00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.210\nokay for you to interact or for\nyou to be able to send me emails.\n\n44\n00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.800\nThe other way to do it is\nblack listing instead.\n\n45\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.070\nWhere you say,\nhey let's let everybody come in and\n\n46\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.740\nI'll just go ahead and mark the people\nthat I don't want to have access.\n\n47\n00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.850\nSo those are what we talked about\nnormally when we think of some type of\n\n48\n00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.860\nlist that we have to be able to configure.\n\n49\n00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.680\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie with so many users,\n\n50\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.750\nhow do we choose which is\nthe best list for which user?\n\n51\n00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.700\nOr their needs for that matter?\n\n52\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually a good question,\nbecause since we're normally talking\n\n53\n00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.480\nabout the Administrative level of\ndoing things, normally for us, right?\n\n54\n00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.930\nThat means that we're gonna set\nsome type of default policy.\n\n55\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.480\nAnd the problem with that is that,\n\n56\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.260\nevery individual user may do\nit a little bit differently.\n\n57\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.140\nSo this is one in which we really\ncan't set just a very generic policy,\n\n58\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.740\nand say, we are allowing this or not.\n\n59\n00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.180\nDon't get me wrong, can you do it?\n\n60\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.160\nYes.\n\n61\n00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.310\nYou can go ahead and say,\nwe've just received so\n\n62\n00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.940\nmany emails from this one\nemail that has just been spam.\n\n63\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.900\nLet's go ahead and blacklist him totally.\n\n64\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.200\nOr you might even be able to say for\nyour entire organization.\n\n65\n00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.000\nAs long as the email comes from my\npartner domain, we can do that.\n\n66\n00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.930\nBut most users, though.\n\n67\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.670\nThey need that ability\nto really adjust it, and\n\n68\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.070\nto make it work the way that they need to.\n\n69\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.986\nSo when we start setting up\nsomething like this, though.\n\n70\n00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.507\nWhat we really need is what\nwe call end user training,\n\n71\n00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:04.200\nis what actually needs\nto happen at this point.\n\n72\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.770\nAnd once they have that, right,\n\n73\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.230\nyou need to actually tell them\nthat here's what's gonna happen.\n\n74\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.570\nWe're gonna give you control to be able\nto see what becomes junk mail, and\n\n75\n00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.440\nwhat doesn't, and\nsome of the things that happen.\n\n76\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.300\nSo let's go ahead and take a look then.\n\n77\n00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.780\nSo I'm gonna be on a client machine, so\nthis is actually Joey's computer here.\n\n78\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.732\nLet me make sure I login as Joey.\n\n79\n00:04:29.106 --> 00:04:34.189\nAnd now that I've logged in as Joey,\nbecause we're only dealing with\n\n80\n00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:39.014\nthe idea of email and we want to\nensure that this particular end user\n\n81\n00:04:39.014 --> 00:04:44.030\nJoey himself can be able to mark junk\nmail as it comes in if it needs to.\n\n82\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.750\nI simply need to launch Outlook,\nso I click on the Window's button,\n\n83\n00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.030\nthen I'm gonna select Outlook 2016.\n\n84\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.680\nIn a moment it should actually, of course,\ngive me access to his account and\n\n85\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.010\nI should be able to verify\nthat we are connecting here.\n\n86\n00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.640\nAnd if we take a look underneath of\npretty much, right here, there we go.\n\n87\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.190\nNotice I am connected to Exchange Online,\nso we are ready to go.\n\n88\n00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.620\nIn this information\nthat we see right here.\n\n89\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.090\nIf we end up getting\nsomething in our inbox, and\n\n90\n00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.960\nwe want to be able to\nmark this as junk mail.\n\n91\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.220\nA lot of times it's\nrelatively easy to do so.\n\n92\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.668\nSo let me just select this one for\nright now.\n\n93\n00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:30.270\nIf I right-click, notice that I can\ncome down here to where it says junk.\n\n94\n00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.160\nAnd now you can see where I can block\nan individual sender if I want to, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.630\nI can block the sender's entire domain or\nnever block this group or mailing list.\n\n96\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.410\nIf I select down here at the bottom.\n\n97\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.511\nLet me see if I can\nscroll down a little bit.\n\n98\n00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:49.279\nThere we go, Junk E-mail Options.\n\n99\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.850\nAnd it's here that we need just\na little bit of end user training.\n\n100\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.260\nSo, notice that there are actually five\ndifferent tabs that are available to us.\n\n101\n00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.580\nThe options give us this ability, right?\n\n102\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.210\nOutlook can move messages that appear in\njunk mail to a special junk mail folder.\n\n103\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.398\nNo automatic filtering,\nlow, high, safe lists only.\n\n104\n00:06:13.398 --> 00:06:18.060\nPermanent delete or suspected email\ninstead of moving the junk mail.\n\n105\n00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.950\nSo here's a delete option.\n\n106\n00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.600\nBut we were really talking about\nthe idea of a list as well.\n\n107\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.870\nSo notice here it says, safe list only,\nonly mail from people or\n\n108\n00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.800\ndomain on your safe senders list.\n\n109\n00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.790\nOr safe recipients list will\nbe delivered to your inbox.\n\n110\n00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.610\nNow, this is where the end user\nmight get a little bit confused.\n\n111\n00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.680\nThey put a mark here and\nthey click OK and they forget.\n\n112\n00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.460\nWell, who's on that safe senders list?\n\n113\n00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.370\nPossibly everyone, but\nthey have to remember that there are two\n\n114\n00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.820\nother options up here,\nactually more options than that.\n\n115\n00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.804\nBut notice that this is\nwhat it's talking about.\n\n116\n00:06:51.804 --> 00:06:56.349\nIf you select Safe List only,\nthe end user also needs to either have\n\n117\n00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:01.880\nsomething in the safe senders and\nin the safe recipients lists as well.\n\n118\n00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.820\nSo, if I were to select that one,\nsafe list only,\n\n119\n00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.220\nnotice it also adds in by default\na couple of other warnings here.\n\n120\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.610\nDisable links and\nother functionality in phishing messages,\n\n121\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.620\nwarn me about suspicious domains and\nemail addresses too.\n\n122\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.240\nThen I can click on\nSafe Senders at this point.\n\n123\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.490\nEmail addresses from domain or\n\n124\n00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.110\ndomain names on the Safe Senders list\nwill never be treated as junk mail.\n\n125\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.710\nSo I can click on Add at this point, and\n\n126\n00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.138\nthen we'll just add myself in for\nright now.\n\n127\n00:07:34.138 --> 00:07:35.871\nitpro.tv.\n\n128\n00:07:38.027 --> 00:07:42.467\nOops, so I could either add in\nan individual, well, maybe.\n\n129\n00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:48.286\n[LAUGH] Or if I wanted to I could\nadd in an entire domain name.\n\n130\n00:07:52.448 --> 00:07:59.920\nIt says to do without the,\nWith the add symbol.\n\n131\n00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.320\nSo, this way,\nnotice that I can actually do both here.\n\n132\n00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.910\nSo, I selected kind of a lab demo\nname that I have for domain, and\n\n133\n00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.480\nI also selected a real email account for\nus, too.\n\n134\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.267\nSo that we could see this if we wanted to,\nokay?\n\n135\n00:08:14.267 --> 00:08:18.706\nSo, that gives us that ability to make\nsure that that happens, and that for us,\n\n136\n00:08:18.706 --> 00:08:21.620\nis essentially the idea of white listing.\n\n137\n00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.310\nIf we want to, right?\n\n138\n00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.605\nThat if we select that one option, Safe\nList Only, this is essentially a white\n\n139\n00:08:27.605 --> 00:08:32.600\nlist is what it's creating that says block\neverything else, but what I have here.\n\n140\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.350\nOnly mail from the people here, too.\n\n141\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.360\nOn the safe recipients,\nemails sent to addresses in the domain\n\n142\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.600\non your safe recipients will\nnever be treated as junk mail.\n\n143\n00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.470\nNow, in theory, this works of course\nif the recipients that are getting this\n\n144\n00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.870\nhaven't marked you as being junk mail.\n\n145\n00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.710\nBut overall though, it actually also\ngives you that ability to say, hey,\n\n146\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.560\nlook I'm coming in and whatever\nscore it gives you, they're talking.\n\n147\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.236\nAnd they're making sure that this is\nnot happening, or they're trying to.\n\n148\n00:09:00.236 --> 00:09:05.100\nOf course, Block Senders would be\nthe same as what we call a black list,\n\n149\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.600\nis what we would have.\n\n150\n00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.158\nAnd then on international email's you may\nchoose to block Top Level Domain List.\n\n151\n00:09:12.158 --> 00:09:15.321\nNow, if you do that, it's probably\ngoing to block every piece of email\n\n152\n00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.500\nregardless of whether it's junk mail,\nor not.\n\n153\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.580\nSo, this may not be your best option,\nbut can you do it, it is out there.\n\n154\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.245\nSo, we're probably gonna end up sticking,\nespecially if we tell people.\n\n155\n00:09:25.245 --> 00:09:28.730\nOkay, here's what you want to do is\nyou want to create a white list, or\n\n156\n00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:33.210\na Safe Senders list, and you wanna make\nsure and maybe save recipients here.\n\n157\n00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.780\nBut this is probably the more key idea,\nis this idea of the Safe Senders list.\n\n158\n00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.890\nNow, I'm going to select this and\nremove this for right now.\n\n159\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.330\nIt's not that it hurts anything, but other\npeople are actually using this account,\n\n160\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.030\nso I don't want to block this, or\naccidentally do something that I didn't\n\n161\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.210\nmean to do as other people\nare using it at the same time.\n\n162\n00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.770\nSo, at least you can see that.\n\n163\n00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.120\nBut it is, a lot of this comes\ndown to end user training.\n\n164\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.008\nI, as an administrator's act,\nI could be the true dictator, and\n\n165\n00:10:02.008 --> 00:10:05.150\nset the policy and\nreally lock it down, but\n\n166\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:11.118\nthat doesn't help you out if you really\nneeded this particular email to come in.\n\n167\n00:10:11.118 --> 00:10:12.522\nAnd I say, I don't care, I blocked and\n\n168\n00:10:12.522 --> 00:10:14.850\nyou're gonna have to deal\nwith it some other way.\n\n169\n00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.580\nSo, it all comes down to the business\ndecision that needs to be made.\n\n170\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.570\nBut the smartest way to do this\nis not by setting a policy,\n\n171\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.130\neven though we can do it.\n\n172\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.370\nIt really is by end-user training,\nwhich takes a little bit more effort.\n\n173\n00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.185\nBut it is the smarter way to go,\nand the more efficient way to go,\n\n174\n00:10:31.185 --> 00:10:35.090\nbecause of the number of different\nways that we tend to use email.\n\n175\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.276\nAnd we and actually kind of block, or\nmassage the way the email comes into us.\n\n176\n00:10:39.276 --> 00:10:43.075\nAnd that's what we wanna make sure of,\nis that it fits our organization,\n\n177\n00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:44.810\nnot just what Ronnie wants to do.\n\n178\n00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.450\nSo, that is a big part of something\nthat we really need to think of.\n\n179\n00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.979\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, perfect, perfect, and Ronnie,\n\n180\n00:10:51.979 --> 00:10:53.560\nlet's go back to notifications for\na second.\n\n181\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.920\nYou mentioned before that three\ndays is kind of a parameter for\n\n182\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.988\nbeing notified of spam.\n\n183\n00:11:00.988 --> 00:11:04.653\nIs there a way that you can change that,\ncan you make it less than three days,\n\n184\n00:11:04.653 --> 00:11:06.558\ncan you make it longer than three days?\n\n185\n00:11:06.558 --> 00:11:08.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe definitely can do something like that.\n\n186\n00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.940\nSo, the very fact is,\nI did mention I believe in part one that\n\n187\n00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:18.080\nby default we normally get a notification\nevery three days about spam, okay?\n\n188\n00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.230\nHere it is, you've got stuff, number\nof spam messages, whatever it might be.\n\n189\n00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.640\nBut you do get notified of the spam,\n\n190\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.010\nbecause it's actually wanting you to\ngo through and try to look at it.\n\n191\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.720\nIn case something did get caught\nin the spam filter itself.\n\n192\n00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.670\nOr it may actually be a legitimate mail.\n\n193\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.657\nAnd I've had this happen,\nZack, where I actually asked,\n\n194\n00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:42.650\nI requested somebody to send me an e-mail.\n\n195\n00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.780\nAnd they sent it to me.\n\n196\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.130\nAnd I waited a day.\n\n197\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.570\nI waited two days.\n\n198\n00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.364\nAnd so finally I sent them\nan e-mail back saying, hey,\n\n199\n00:11:48.364 --> 00:11:50.270\nI never got the e-mail\nfrom you I was expecting.\n\n200\n00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.990\nThey said we sent it to you, and\nI didn't check my spam folder, and\n\n201\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.850\nthere it was two days earlier,\na message came in, and\n\n202\n00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.330\nit was just sitting in my spam folder,\nand that's because I didn't check.\n\n203\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:06.645\nSo, these reminders can be important\nthat there may be information in there\n\n204\n00:12:06.645 --> 00:12:12.060\nthat you definitely want to at least\nreview, before you kind of get rid of it.\n\n205\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.682\nSo, this is probably where we as\nadministrators don't want to go, okay,\n\n206\n00:12:15.682 --> 00:12:19.015\nall the spam messages we're going\nto permanently delete it as soon as\n\n207\n00:12:19.015 --> 00:12:20.970\nit hits the mailbox itself.\n\n208\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.730\nWhat we want to do instead\nis give notifications\n\n209\n00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.530\nthat let them know, here it is.\n\n210\n00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.220\nHere's our default three day warning,\n\n211\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.720\nyou've got junk mail, you may want\nto look at what's actually in there.\n\n212\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.640\nYou can change that depending\non what your need is.\n\n213\n00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.540\nYou can make it a lot longer than that.\n\n214\n00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.360\nYou of course can reduce the time.\n\n215\n00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.870\nSo, let's go ahead and\nsee how we can do that.\n\n216\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.459\nSo, hopefully I'm going to log in.\n\n217\n00:12:47.353 --> 00:12:51.640\nI don't know why this password\njust kind of [LAUGH].\n\n218\n00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.620\nIt challenges me for\none reason, or another,\n\n219\n00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.010\ncuz it's long is what ends up happening.\n\n220\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.080\n&gt;&gt; Better than having\nthe password being password.\n\n221\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you shouldn't do that ever\nespecially with Cloud services.\n\n222\n00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.150\nThat would be a really,\nreally bad thing when we start here.\n\n223\n00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.830\nNow, if I wanna adjust the idea of\nthe spam notification messages,\n\n224\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.270\nI need to get into\nthe Exchange Admin Center.\n\n225\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.150\nSo, here I am,\nlogged in on Office 365 as Joey.\n\n226\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.680\nIf I select Admin, then over on the left\nhand side when everything populates in,\n\n227\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.890\nwe're gonna go down to the very bottom\nof this navigation bar that we have.\n\n228\n00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.480\nNavigation pane.\n\n229\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.200\nSelect underneath the admin icon.\n\n230\n00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.230\nFrom there,\nwe're going to select Exchange.\n\n231\n00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:37.110\nAnd inside of the Exchange Admin Center,\nthere are, of course,\n\n232\n00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.930\nare different navigation panes again,\nthat we have over here.\n\n233\n00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.210\nWe're going to select the one\nthat's marked as protection.\n\n234\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:51.047\nAnd within protection here,\nwhat we are going to also look for,\n\n235\n00:13:51.047 --> 00:13:54.044\nit's gonna be underneath Spam Filter.\n\n236\n00:14:01.187 --> 00:14:04.244\nAnd once I select Spam Filter,\n\n237\n00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:09.190\nlet me scroll down here,\nso that you can see this.\n\n238\n00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.410\nIt did, it's actually buried a little\nbit deeper than you'd think, right?\n\n239\n00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.961\nSo, notice the one that's actually in\nblue that's kind of gone right behind my\n\n240\n00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:17.830\nhead here.\n\n241\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.650\nWhere it says,\nConfigure end-user spam notifications.\n\n242\n00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.060\nLet me see if I can lift that\nup a little bit higher, so\n\n243\n00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.062\nthat we can see that a little bit,\noops, kinda zoomed out there.\n\n244\n00:14:28.062 --> 00:14:31.780\nSo, notice it's actually\nnext to the last option.\n\n245\n00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.011\nSo, it's not real easy, right?\n\n246\n00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:36.280\nBy default, when you first see this and\nyou're like where the heck it is.\n\n247\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.783\nWell, it's not gonna be right here.\n\n248\n00:14:37.783 --> 00:14:41.466\nI'm gonna need to scroll all\nthe way down to the bottom, and\n\n249\n00:14:41.466 --> 00:14:46.570\nthen this is where we're looking for\nConfigure end-users spam notifications.\n\n250\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:51.460\nOnce I select that option,\nit is here that I can now\n\n251\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:57.170\nEnable the end-user spam notifications for\nthis particular one.\n\n252\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:01.110\nSend end-user spam\nnotifications every 3 days.\n\n253\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:05.436\nIf I want this to happen, notice I can\nactually select Enable end-user spam\n\n254\n00:15:05.436 --> 00:15:09.306\nnotifications, and you saw where\nthe default was 3 days anyways.\n\n255\n00:15:09.306 --> 00:15:12.560\nThe only thing I didn't have is that\nit was turned off for right now.\n\n256\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.160\nAnd I don't know, I think,\nI might have turned that one off.\n\n257\n00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.860\nSo, I know the default is set up.\n\n258\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:21.410\nSo, now, in theory, right, once we have\nthis it will end up sending essentially\n\n259\n00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.730\nan email that will let\nthem know every 3 days.\n\n260\n00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.960\nFrom here,\nI can change this down to let's say, 1 and\n\n261\n00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.530\nnotice the maximum number of days too.\n\n262\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.870\nSo, I can specify a number between 1 and\n\n263\n00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:39.610\n15 days for each notification message,\nand that normally includes a list of\n\n264\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:45.240\nthe spam quarantine messages since\nthe last one that was sent, too.\n\n265\n00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.907\nSo, that gives us that,\nwe can even, of course,\n\n266\n00:15:47.907 --> 00:15:51.158\nchoose a different language\ndepending on what your need is.\n\n267\n00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:55.640\nI'm gonna leave mine at the default,\nwhich for us is here in English, and\n\n268\n00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.905\nthat's what we would actually be able\nto setup very easily If we wanted\n\n269\n00:15:59.905 --> 00:16:04.383\nto, Let that save,\n\n270\n00:16:04.383 --> 00:16:08.320\nhopefully, in just a moment,\nit's taking it's sweet time, of course.\n\n271\n00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.700\nSo now, it's actually turned on and\nI'm saving this, so, for\n\n272\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:17.100\nthat particular filter that I had created\nthere, which is my test filter, it will\n\n273\n00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.220\nnow send me every day, a notification of\nspam that's come in to be able to do that.\n\n274\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.040\nYou should be able to verify right here\nwhere it actually is right above my,\n\n275\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.332\nyeah right here.\n\n276\n00:16:29.332 --> 00:16:34.150\nSend end-user spam notifications\nevery 1 day if we chose to.\n\n277\n00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.310\nNow that's not enough, right, so\nonce we actually get to this point,\n\n278\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.600\nyou definitely need to know\nwhere that's gonna be.\n\n279\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.740\nYou can choose it, of course, for\n\n280\n00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.700\nthe default if you want to,\nas well as the test filter, too.\n\n281\n00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.430\nBut it also means we need to make sure\nthat we can do this inside of PowerShell.\n\n282\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.090\nAll right, so\nnow that I'm actually in the PowerShell,\n\n283\n00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.160\nlet me make sure that I\nam still connected here.\n\n284\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.430\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n285\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.370\n&gt;&gt; Make sure that it's actually open,\nmake sure that we are available,\n\n286\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.650\nI am on Microsoft Exchange,\nwhich is actually good.\n\n287\n00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.640\nTo take a look at the actual\npolicies that are there\n\n288\n00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.840\nI'm really gonna get the one\nthat we're gonna affect.\n\n289\n00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.280\nSo, I already affected the test filter\npolicy, now, the other one that was there,\n\n290\n00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.000\nthe default one is the one\nthat I wanna affect.\n\n291\n00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.310\nSo, if I want to do that, let's take\na look at that one, get hosted content,\n\n292\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:26.178\nfilter, oops, well maybe.\n\n293\n00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:29.470\nHosted, I'm like why is that not working?\n\n294\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:35.560\nFilterPolicy, from here I can\ntype in Default, and press Enter.\n\n295\n00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.110\nWhen I do so, that will give me a list of\n\n296\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.290\nall of the different things that\nwe're actually taking a look at here.\n\n297\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.370\nAnd the other thing, of course, is that\nnow that we see that everything is good.\n\n298\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:51.100\nWhat I want to do it's actually change\nthe notification area that we have.\n\n299\n00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.520\nThe way that we do this is\nthat we instead set the hosted\n\n300\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.300\ncontent filter policy,\nthen we can apply an option called\n\n301\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:08.040\nEndUserSpamNotification, and\nnot all these other field.\n\n302\n00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.280\nNow there's several of them, so\nlet's take a look at some of these, and\n\n303\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.740\nthey should make sense here.\n\n304\n00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:17.144\nSo notice how long this option is,\nright, EndUserSpamNotification,\n\n305\n00:18:17.144 --> 00:18:20.840\nif I hit the Tab,\nnotice it actually can be CustomFromName.\n\n306\n00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:27.284\nSo we can actually set a very custom one\nof where it's from, even an Address,\n\n307\n00:18:27.284 --> 00:18:34.540\na Subject, Language,\nLimit here, Frequency.\n\n308\n00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.910\nNow Frequency is the one that we want\nbecause we wanted to really adjust\n\n309\n00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.220\nthat particular idea of how\noften we're getting it.\n\n310\n00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.800\nAnd that would match up to the policy that\nwe actually did see inside of the web UI.\n\n311\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.131\nLet me make sure I remind you,\nor let's select default here.\n\n312\n00:18:54.129 --> 00:18:57.232\nRemember that we actually\nare really adjusting that, and\n\n313\n00:18:57.232 --> 00:19:00.288\nthat's the frequency number\nis what we're doing here.\n\n314\n00:19:00.288 --> 00:19:04.211\nSo let me cancel here and verify,\nso let's select Frequency,\n\n315\n00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:08.170\nfrom here I can just say\nlet's do 2 days instead.\n\n316\n00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.260\nOnce I select this, I can now press\nEnter and now it's gonna say,\n\n317\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.620\nhey are you sure you want\nto do this in the identity.\n\n318\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.590\nLet's set this for Default because I\ncould've typed in the name and I didn't.\n\n319\n00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.840\nSo now it's asking me for the identity,\nso now I'm setting this up for\n\n320\n00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.940\nthe default spam filter notification.\n\n321\n00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.850\nHopefully, everything will take and\nat this point once everything is done,\n\n322\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.890\nthat will now become our default\none that will get enabled for\n\n323\n00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.250\nus in what we want to be able to do.\n\n324\n00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.840\nSo we're gonna just let that one\nkind of run, and there it goes.\n\n325\n00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.830\nWe now know that everything is set up, and\n\n326\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.100\nnow we've actually got that\npolicy set up and ready to go.\n\n327\n00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.560\nSo this is really that first part\nwhere we really dealt with the idea of\n\n328\n00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:56.010\nthe anti-spam as well and there's really\njust one more topic for us to cover.\n\n329\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:00.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's the advantage or\nrather the advanced threats protection.\n\n330\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:06.015\nAnd what is the advance threat protection\nfeatures inside of Exchange Online?\n\n331\n00:20:06.015 --> 00:20:10.882\n&gt;&gt; When we start talking about this,\nthis is one of those anti-malware features\n\n332\n00:20:10.882 --> 00:20:14.139\nthat's gonna be built into\nExchange Online for us.\n\n333\n00:20:14.139 --> 00:20:18.092\nSo that we don't have to worry about\ngoing in and finding the anti-virus and\n\n334\n00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:21.350\nthe anti-malware programs that are there.\n\n335\n00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:25.480\nThe Exchange Online\nAdvanced Threat Protection,\n\n336\n00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.050\nit really is our cloud based type\nof filtering that's protecting us\n\n337\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.960\nfrom a lot of the different malicious\nsoftware that's already out there for us.\n\n338\n00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.900\nFrom unknown malware especially\nas well as zero day attacks,\n\n339\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.322\nit is built into the system and\n\n340\n00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:42.530\nit's something that we definitely\nwant to make sure that we understand.\n\n341\n00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.070\nProviding real time protection for\n\n342\n00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.670\nthe overall organization in terms of\nemail, it is a very effective system.\n\n343\n00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.840\nSomething that we should not neglect\nto do this, what we really want to do\n\n344\n00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.360\nis show you really the two settings at\nthis point that you'll definitely want to\n\n345\n00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.750\ntake a look at in terms configuring and\nmake sure you also know them for the exam.\n\n346\n00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.320\nAnd of course,\nhow do you actually get there to.\n\n347\n00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.510\nThe great thing is,\nwe're ready on Exchange Online, so\n\n348\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.740\nthis gives us the ability to go and\nget this set up.\n\n349\n00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.510\nSo let's take a look from this point here.\n\n350\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:15.997\nOnce we're actually in\nthe Exchange Admin Center,\n\n351\n00:21:15.997 --> 00:21:19.878\nwhat we want to do is scroll\ndown here on the left hand side,\n\n352\n00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:24.871\nand you'll notice that there is\nadvanced threat, the advance threat\n\n353\n00:21:24.871 --> 00:21:29.329\nprotection we would thing that\nwould come under advance threats.\n\n354\n00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:34.459\nAnd here are the two settings that we\nare definitely taking a look at here,\n\n355\n00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:37.539\nsafe attachments and of course safe links.\n\n356\n00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:42.019\nIf I click on the plus sign for\nsafe attachments and\n\n357\n00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:47.565\nnow will give me the ability to\nhave a policy that I can create,\n\n358\n00:21:47.565 --> 00:21:51.100\ncall this one test attachment policy.\n\n359\n00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.630\nThen we would actually give a description,\nbut\n\n360\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:22:01.150\nnotice right here where it says Safe\nattachments unknown malware response.\n\n361\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:06.270\nSelect the action for\nan unknown malware attachments here, so,\n\n362\n00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.910\nthis is actually saying, hey,\nwhat are we actually trying to do?\n\n363\n00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:13.990\nWhat do we want to be able to do\nhere when we get an unknown mower?\n\n364\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.380\nFor us,\nthis is normally the zero day attacks, and\n\n365\n00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.030\nthat's what we're really worried about.\n\n366\n00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.170\nNotice that we have these\noptions that are available,\n\n367\n00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:27.380\nright, Warning, Monitor replace block\nactions may cause significant delay.\n\n368\n00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.740\nDynamic Delivery is only available for\nrecipients with hosted mailboxes.\n\n369\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.720\nNow that second one, where you have\nDynamic Delivery, well this one is saying\n\n370\n00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.650\nlook, if you don't have\nan Office 365 Exchange account,\n\n371\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.380\nit's probably not gonna\nbe available to you.\n\n372\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.081\nSo Exchange Online only you're not\ngonna have this, but notice that,\n\n373\n00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:50.609\nhere it is right now, Attachments\nwill not be scanned for malware.\n\n374\n00:22:50.609 --> 00:22:55.806\nWell that's not exactly great for\nyour organization, but it also comes\n\n375\n00:22:55.806 --> 00:23:01.514\nin with that certain level you normally,\nI wanna make sure you take a look here,\n\n376\n00:23:01.514 --> 00:23:06.479\nthat your subscriptions, why I should\ngive you the ability to do so.\n\n377\n00:23:06.479 --> 00:23:08.903\nAnd as long as they are mailbox enabled,\n\n378\n00:23:08.903 --> 00:23:12.200\nwe normally do have\naccess to this as well.\n\n379\n00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.000\nMonitor, Continue delivering\nthe message after malware is detected,\n\n380\n00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.940\nbut track scan results.\n\n381\n00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.590\nIn other words, did it actually detect it,\nokay, Block, Block current and\n\n382\n00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.880\nfuture emails and\nattachment with detected malware.\n\n383\n00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.020\nThat sounds like a great idea as well,\nand then, of course, Block attachments\n\n384\n00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.730\nwith detected malware, but continue\nto deliver the rest of the message.\n\n385\n00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.900\nWell to me, that sound a little bit\nmore useless than anything else.\n\n386\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.240\nBut it could be that somebody\nreally did get hacked,\n\n387\n00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.330\nand they are trying to send you a message.\n\n388\n00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.390\nBut overall, though, I would say\nBlock would probably be the one, and\n\n389\n00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.911\nthen Dynamic Delivery, Deliver message\nwithout any attachments immediately,\n\n390\n00:23:47.911 --> 00:23:49.608\nre-attach once the scan is complete.\n\n391\n00:23:49.608 --> 00:23:53.158\nSeems kind of foolish, but\nat the same time, here,\n\n392\n00:23:53.158 --> 00:23:57.446\nit's up to your security policy,\nto figure out what you need.\n\n393\n00:23:57.446 --> 00:24:01.949\nNotice of course,\nyou can also redirect what this is too and\n\n394\n00:24:01.949 --> 00:24:04.360\nhow this is gonna work.\n\n395\n00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.420\nAnd it is here that you also\nhave that ability to essentially\n\n396\n00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:14.490\nlimit the scope of what we want\nin this particular policy.\n\n397\n00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.980\nNotice that I can do the same thing.\n\n398\n00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.770\nI can actually choose\na particular recipient,\n\n399\n00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:24.090\na particular domain, or even a security\ngroup that is mailed enabled.\n\n400\n00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.300\nI can even have that if I want to.\n\n401\n00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:26.850\nI, of course,\n\n402\n00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:31.800\ncan actually specify that a little bit\nmore by adding an additional condition.\n\n403\n00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.450\nAnd, of course,\n\n404\n00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:37.110\nif there is any exceptions to this policy,\nwe can add that in there as well.\n\n405\n00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.050\nSo, by taking a look at that, it will\ngo through our emails and take a look,\n\n406\n00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.815\nof course, at the attachments.\n\n407\n00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:47.505\nWhat's even scarier than just attachments\nbecause people are starting to know\n\n408\n00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:50.375\nthere's more and\nmore about attachments here,\n\n409\n00:24:50.375 --> 00:24:55.350\nare different links that can appear in\nrandom emails that come in as well.\n\n410\n00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.540\nSo it's the same procedure, right?\n\n411\n00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.500\nWith the different links, we click on New.\n\n412\n00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.157\nAnd here, once we get it set up,\nwe would select a new link policy.\n\n413\n00:25:09.427 --> 00:25:11.150\nAnd then, of course, description.\n\n414\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.870\nBut notice now,\nyou have different actions for\n\n415\n00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.990\nunknown potentially\nmalicious URL's in messages.\n\n416\n00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.120\nThose are links that\npeople might click on.\n\n417\n00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.980\nURL's will be re-written and\nchecked, excuse me,\n\n418\n00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:30.270\nagainst known malicious links\nwhen a user clicks on it.\n\n419\n00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.240\nSounds like a good idea.\n\n420\n00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.185\nAlso notice now these other three\ndown here that are in squares.\n\n421\n00:25:36.185 --> 00:25:38.580\nThese can be use in combinations.\n\n422\n00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.390\nWhereas on and off is just that, right?\n\n423\n00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.630\nIf I select on,\nI definitely don't have off available.\n\n424\n00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:50.120\nBut once I do have on, notice I can\nactually check all three of these or\n\n425\n00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.540\njust check one of them if I want to.\n\n426\n00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:57.540\nUse safe attachments to download,\nto scan downloadable content.\n\n427\n00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.240\nDo not track user clicks.\n\n428\n00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.320\nDo not allow users to click\nthrough to the original URL.\n\n429\n00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.080\nSo I may go, all right, these are the two\nthat I really want if I chose to do that.\n\n430\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.900\nAnd then, of course, at the very end,\nlet me scroll down a little bit more.\n\n431\n00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:19.890\nWe can also rewrite URLs or tell it not\nrewrite them and at the end, once again,\n\n432\n00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:24.260\nwho is it going to end up applying to and\nwhat are the exceptions to that.\n\n433\n00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.130\nSo, here in the policies\nthat we end up seeing for\n\n434\n00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.600\nthis, notice again, safe links,\nsafe attachments here.\n\n435\n00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.950\nThat's the advanced threat protection,\nreally protecting us against those zero\n\n436\n00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:39.440\nday types of attacks that end users\naren't probably ready for a lot of times.\n\n437\n00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.630\nBut we can set this up, especially\nif we start noticing the patterns.\n\n438\n00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.770\nAnd it really is helpful as\nwe do something like this.\n\n439\n00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.780\nSo it allows us that ability, right?\n\n440\n00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.620\nTo not worry about am I\nchoosing the right one?\n\n441\n00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.340\nThis is essentially setup\nby Microsoft themselves and\n\n442\n00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.530\nthey are great at handling this stuff.\n\n443\n00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.280\nSo don't think you're just\ngoing to buy whatever piece of\n\n444\n00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.500\nAnti Malware on the showroom\nfloor that is actually out there.\n\n445\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.830\nAnd go okay I'm going to attach this.\n\n446\n00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.130\nIt's not going to work if you\nare using Exchange Online.\n\n447\n00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.820\nYou'll need to use their advanced\nthreat protection to make it work.\n\n448\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.900\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well Ronnie, thanks very much.\n\n449\n00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.951\nWe have learned quite a lot\nabout managing Anti-malware, and\n\n450\n00:27:17.951 --> 00:27:20.830\nAnti-spam policies and\nthere's a lot more too.\n\n451\n00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:24.760\nBy the way, if you missed part one go\nback and watch that, you'll enjoy it.\n\n452\n00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:30.790\nI'm your host Zach Memos for enabling\nOffice 365 as we go one with this series,\n\n453\n00:27:30.790

00:00:08.185\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:10.392\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.392 --> 00:00:13.874\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.874 --> 00:00:16.635\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:21.790\nI'm your host Zack Memos for\nEnabling Office 365 Services.\n\n8\n00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.920\nAnd right now, we are going to be\nlooking at mailbox migration strategy\n\n9\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.030\nwith our IT professional, Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.550\nHey Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; How are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.330\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n12\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.480\nAnd my first question to you is,\nwhy should we want to migrate or\n\n13\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.930\nmove our mailbox?\n\n14\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great question.\n\n15\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.970\nA lot of times,\n\n16\n00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.360\ninside of organizations that have been\nusing their own in house email servers.\n\n17\n00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.500\nAnd now they start to use Office 365,\n\n18\n00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.972\nI was trying to remember what product\nwe're actually talking about.\n\n19\n00:00:50.972 --> 00:00:52.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Office 365.\n&gt;&gt; But yes,\n\n20\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.570\nnow that we're actually using Office 365,\n\n21\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.840\nthen they find out that\nthere is an Exchange Online.\n\n22\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.200\nWell how do you know which server should\nactually be hosting your emails for you?\n\n23\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.430\nYou have an actual Exchange Server\nactually out there in the cloud now,\n\n24\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.970\nyou have one online inside\nof your own business.\n\n25\n00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.320\nWell you have a bunch of different\nthings that you want to consider as\n\n26\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.000\nyou actually start doing that.\n\n27\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.860\nSome organizations go look, I don't\nwant Office 365 to manage my email,\n\n28\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.480\nI'll do it all in house, which is great.\n\n29\n00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.940\nIf that's something that you choose to do,\nI'm glad for\n\n30\n00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.230\nyou and hopefully, of course, continued\nsuccess in everything that you do.\n\n31\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.030\nAs you continue to migrate\ntowards Office 365 though,\n\n32\n00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.740\nif you now make a strategic option.\n\n33\n00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.980\nYou go, here is what we're going to do.\n\n34\n00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.610\nWe're going to not worry about\nour in house services anymore or\n\n35\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.490\nour servers,\nwe want to move everything into the cloud.\n\n36\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.260\nWell that now becomes\na bit more of a challenge.\n\n37\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.510\nWith a handful of people\nis probably not so bad.\n\n38\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.160\nWith a handful of people is simple, you\nhave your regular email server in house,\n\n39\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.540\nyou just create brand new accounts for\nthem and the Exchange Online.\n\n40\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.860\nOnce you actually create an Office 365\naccount, you give them a particular\n\n41\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.840\nsubscription and once you have that,\nit creates an email box for them anyways.\n\n42\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.100\nAnd then all you have to do is kind of get\nthe networking side in order to make sure\n\n43\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.010\nthat your email is directed to that\nserver and you're off and ready to go.\n\n44\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.630\nBut the problem comes in, and the idea\nof a migration strategy has to come in,\n\n45\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.780\nif I have existing emails and existing\nemail servers that are actually doing\n\n46\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.000\nthe work that needs to be done for\nmy organization.\n\n47\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.720\nBut now I decide I want\nto move into that cloud.\n\n48\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.960\nAnd I want to actually say we're going\nto get rid of this infrastructure and\n\n49\n00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.240\nnow we're going to try\nto go in to the cloud.\n\n50\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.490\nOr it may even be where,\nis there a way we can do both?\n\n51\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.500\nThere is, it's probably not\nthe best strategy in the world, but\n\n52\n00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.110\npeople have been doing it successfully.\n\n53\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.780\nSo it is possible to do that as well.\n\n54\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.010\nSo once you actually start saying that we\nare making that move, you can't just say\n\n55\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.090\nall right, Zack, we are going do this and\nwe are going to do it right now.\n\n56\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.730\nIt just doesn't happen that way, you have\nto understand the strategies that are out\n\n57\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.550\nthere that have been successful for\nother people, and\n\n58\n00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.725\nthen you can follow that kind of route\nto success the same way they have.\n\n59\n00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:25.590\nBy you just trying to jump in and\ndo it all by yourself, I'm not going to\n\n60\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.090\nsay it can't be successful, but\nthe chances of that are less likely.\n\n61\n00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.190\nSo, understanding your organization and\n\n62\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.790\nunderstanding what paths that you\nhave available is going to be key.\n\n63\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.750\nAnd there's several criteria,\n\n64\n00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.176\nas well as some of the different\nmethodologies that we're going to choose.\n\n65\n00:03:42.176 --> 00:03:44.900\nAnd we're going to go over and make sure\nthat you understand which one you might\n\n66\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.790\nchoose in a situation,\nthat you have available.\n\n67\n00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.340\nSo that's what we're going to talk about\ntoday as we begin here is to really\n\n68\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.220\njust kind of say, all right, what\nare the strategies that are out there?\n\n69\n00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.010\nAnd then why would we choose to do that,\nwhich is actually a good question for\n\n70\n00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.398\nus to think about.\n\n71\n00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:08.530\nBut that's what we're really focusing\non because it comes down to that.\n\n72\n00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.930\nYour situation is not the same as\nwhat we had here at ITProTV, and\n\n73\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.340\nITProTV's situation is not\nthe same as what's at Microsoft.\n\n74\n00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.690\nEven when they were actually doing\neverything and having to do that,\n\n75\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.390\nthey had to come up with strategies.\n\n76\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.810\nBecause size makes a difference,\nin terms of number of users.\n\n77\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.090\nAlso of course, the complexity of\ninformation that you have to able\n\n78\n00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.420\nto get up on those servers,\nthe amount of data.\n\n79\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.540\nAll that comes into play as well as\nthe age of the servers that you have\n\n80\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.830\nhosted somewhere else too.\n\n81\n00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.870\nIt may even be that you're not only\nkind of having data let's say that's on\n\n82\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.570\npremises somewhere, but let's say you're\nactually using something like Gmail or\n\n83\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.060\nsomething else, another cloud service.\n\n84\n00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.360\nI want to migrate that into Office 365.\n\n85\n00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.176\nYou have to have a strategy to do that and\n\n86\n00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:58.510\nmake sure that everything works\nout the way that you want to.\n\n87\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.497\nWe're really going to focus in on the on\npremise side moving into the cloud\n\n88\n00:05:02.497 --> 00:05:03.150\nsolution.\n\n89\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.300\nThat's what we're going to focus in on,\nat least for this episode, and\n\n90\n00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.380\nthat's what we're going\nto be talking about.\n\n91\n00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.670\nSo, that is where we'll begin.\n\n92\n00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.890\nNow the great thing is,\ninside of the Office 365 portal we\n\n93\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.860\ncan at least show you how to begin and\nthat will give us a kind of nice little\n\n94\n00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.820\nplatform to jump off of for\neach one of those strategies that we need.\n\n95\n00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.290\nSo let's take a look at my computer,\nand that will help us to get started.\n\n96\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.390\nSo right here, inside of the Office\nAdmin Console, I'm going to click\n\n97\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.839\non the Admin tile, and of course get\nto the EAC, the Exchange Admin Center.\n\n98\n00:05:40.638 --> 00:05:45.578\nOver on the left hand side, I'm going to\nclick on the Admin tile or hover over it,\n\n99\n00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:49.950\nselect exchange and that should bring\nme to the Exchange Admin Center.\n\n100\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.690\nAnd once inside the Exchange Admin Center,\n\n101\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.320\nyou actually see that underneath\nthe category grouping right here for\n\n102\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.400\nrecipients, If I look down there it is,\nmigration.\n\n103\n00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.080\nSo you know that this is something\npretty much at the top of the list,\n\n104\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.720\neven as placement as relatively strategic,\nthat they realize that people may try this\n\n105\n00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.730\nout and use the exchange online\naccounts for just a little bit.\n\n106\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.310\nNot maybe for their primary account, but\njust making sure that everything works,\n\n107\n00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.220\nand then once they actually make sure that\nthis is their solution that they want\n\n108\n00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.540\nto be able to do,\nthen they can choose migration.\n\n109\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.200\nAnd once they get into migration,\n\n110\n00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.800\nyou'll notice that it really\nisn't a lot different from\n\n111\n00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.540\njust about anything else that we've\ndone in the Exchange Admin Center.\n\n112\n00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.600\nWhere we are really going to end up\nhaving to walk through, essentially,\n\n113\n00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.750\na wizard, to get started.\n\n114\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.730\nSo right here,\nif I want to begin migration,\n\n115\n00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.140\nI know that there is actually a new\nbutton, which is the plus sign.\n\n116\n00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.930\nI click on the drop down,\n\n117\n00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.360\nhere is the very first options that\nwe want to deal with right here.\n\n118\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.550\nNotice that we have two options.\n\n119\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.590\nAm I migrating to Exchange Online?\n\n120\n00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.044\nOr, probably an option that you're\nprobably not expecting to see if you\n\n121\n00:07:06.044 --> 00:07:10.020\nhaven't actually opened this up before,\nwhich is migrate from Exchange Online.\n\n122\n00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.250\nThey don't try to hide the fact that it\nmay be that you want to move away from\n\n123\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.670\nExchange Online, and\nmaybe go back to on-premise server, or\n\n124\n00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.468\nmaybe even go somewhere else.\n\n125\n00:07:21.468 --> 00:07:25.020\nSo they give you these two different\nstrategies right away here\n\n126\n00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.330\nbecause they know you actually\ncan use which one you want to do.\n\n127\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.850\nBut for us let's say we're going to pick\nthe migration to the Exchange Online.\n\n128\n00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.360\nIf I select that, let me zoom back out.\n\n129\n00:07:37.398 --> 00:07:42.264\nNow, you will actually see it will give\nus the strategies that we definitely\n\n130\n00:07:42.264 --> 00:07:46.976\nneed to be aware of, and it also helps\nus by talking about some of the things\n\n131\n00:07:46.976 --> 00:07:51.325\nthat you and I must consider when\nwe start talking about migration.\n\n132\n00:07:51.325 --> 00:07:56.297\nAnd I do recommend that if you're\ndoing this for the first time,\n\n133\n00:07:56.297 --> 00:08:02.390\nbefore you do anything, walk through\nthis wizard Just don't finish, okay?\n\n134\n00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.720\nSo if you have everything set up, you have\nyour Exchange on servers that are set up\n\n135\n00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.040\nin house and everything, and they're\nworking fine, walk through the end.\n\n136\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.500\nBut at the very end, don't apply it, okay?\n\n137\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.030\nDon't get it done, but\nwalk through it and go okay,\n\n138\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.400\nI know what's happening next, what should\nbe happening, what's going on here.\n\n139\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.190\nBut now notice that when\nwe start to take a look,\n\n140\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.060\nit tells us that you have to\nactually realize the migration.\n\n141\n00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.395\nCuz there's four different\nstrategies that we'll have.\n\n142\n00:08:28.395 --> 00:08:29.087\nIt says,\n\n143\n00:08:29.087 --> 00:08:34.900\ndepends on your existing email system\nhow many mailboxes do you wanna migrate?\n\n144\n00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.500\nCuz that's gonna become important.\n\n145\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.750\nCuz that will actually help us determine\nwhich one as well, whether you\n\n146\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.900\nplan to maintain some mailboxes on\nyour on-premises organization or\n\n147\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.270\nmigrate them all over to the cloud.\n\n148\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.710\nSo it's saying, do want this\nkind of be a hybrid existence,\n\n149\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.255\nwhere you have some in house, and\nyou have some out on the cloud as well?\n\n150\n00:08:52.255 --> 00:08:56.560\nYou'll also wanna consider how\nlong the migration takes, and\n\n151\n00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.660\nthat's a little bit strange.\n\n152\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.055\nYou might be wondering, why would that\nbe a consideration at all, that it would\n\n153\n00:09:02.055 --> 00:09:06.334\nactually have to come in at the very\nmigration strategy planning, how long?\n\n154\n00:09:06.334 --> 00:09:09.290\nI want it to be immediate,\nthat's what I want.\n\n155\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.130\nNobody wants it to be\nover a span of months.\n\n156\n00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.463\nBut it may be something that you do\nchoose to do or over a span of time here,\n\n157\n00:09:16.463 --> 00:09:21.312\nwhether user identity will be managed\non your on-premises or in Office 365.\n\n158\n00:09:21.312 --> 00:09:25.920\nNow, this is where it gets into some\nmajor complexity levels that are really\n\n159\n00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.260\nbeyond what we're gonna be talking about.\n\n160\n00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.819\nIf you want to learn a little bit more\nabout that along with this, right,\n\n161\n00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:36.920\nmake sure you also take\na look at the 70-346 show.\n\n162\n00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.640\nWhich is the previous one to the 70-347,\n\n163\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.680\nwhich is the one that we're doing\nright here, and taking a look at that.\n\n164\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.210\nBecause that involves, now,\nwhat we call directory synchronization,\n\n165\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.450\nmaking sure that we have\nfederation services set up.\n\n166\n00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.940\nMaking sure that there's a whole\nbunch of things already in place to\n\n167\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.180\nmake that happen.\n\n168\n00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.140\nIf you go, we're gonna actually\nbe managing this on-premises or\n\n169\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.330\nin Office 365,\nmake sure you know which one.\n\n170\n00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:07.550\nSo before you do anything, I would write\ndown a list of these questions here and\n\n171\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.850\nget together with your group,\nwho's gonna be helping you do this, and\n\n172\n00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.500\nmake sure you decide which one.\n\n173\n00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.580\nDon't just walk through and\ngo we'll just try this one.\n\n174\n00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.220\nCuz that's gonna cause more issues than\nyou realize, so don't do that, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.950\nSo as we start off here, let's just go\nahead and talk about these as it comes\n\n176\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.470\nalong, and then we'll make sure that\nwe understand what we're seeing here.\n\n177\n00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.910\nNotice that if you choose this first\none here that talks about the remote\n\n178\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.710\nmove migration.\n\n179\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.800\nNotice that right beside\neach one of these, and Zack,\n\n180\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.780\nI don't mean to kind of give\naway everything here, but\n\n181\n00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.820\nlet's say that this is a hint for\nthe exam, right, okay.\n\n182\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.960\nIs that they tell you one\nof the criteria right away.\n\n183\n00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.920\nLet's say that, for example,\nI am running Exchange 2007,\n\n184\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.750\nnow Zack, just from looking at\nthat top option up here, right?\n\n185\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.790\nRemote move migration, and if I'm running\nExchange 2007, what's the possibility that\n\n186\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:07.860\nI could even do a remote move migration,\naccording to what Microsoft has given me?\n\n187\n00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.710\n&gt;&gt; Slim to none.\n\n188\n00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.320\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\npretty much none to none is what we have.\n\n189\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.000\nSo, that might actually\nbe something that you go,\n\n190\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.480\nI could see that being\nan exam question right away.\n\n191\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.845\nHere's what I'm running, which of\nthe following strategies would I choose?\n\n192\n00:11:21.845 --> 00:11:24.440\nEasy enough, okay?\n\n193\n00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.250\nEasy enough for some easy points,\n\n194\n00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.260\njust, I can't tell you that that's\nexactly what's on the exam.\n\n195\n00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.785\nBut I can tell you that,\n\n196\n00:11:30.785 --> 00:11:36.045\nto me, that sounds like a nice exam\nquestion that somebody just trying to go,\n\n197\n00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:40.196\njust pick any one of them,\nit'll work, it'll be fine, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:40.196 --> 00:11:42.554\nIt's just not gonna happen that way.\n\n199\n00:11:42.554 --> 00:11:45.479\nBut notice some of the other ones here,\nright, staged migration, and\n\n200\n00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:46.571\nlook at this here, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:50.517\nWhat if you are only running 2007?\n\n202\n00:11:50.517 --> 00:11:53.244\nStaged migration seems to be what?\n\n203\n00:11:53.244 --> 00:11:56.741\nRight up my alley at that point,\nokay, because I know, now,\n\n204\n00:11:56.741 --> 00:12:00.394\nit doesn't mean on the exam that\nthey might show you all of this.\n\n205\n00:12:00.394 --> 00:12:03.352\nBut they might just show you, what,\nthese four options and say hey,\n\n206\n00:12:03.352 --> 00:12:05.570\nhere's what you're running.\n\n207\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:10.030\nWhich one of these could it possibly be,\nor which option would be best?\n\n208\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.070\nWhich particular option\nwould you recommend to Zack,\n\n209\n00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.150\nwho's in charge of his\ncompany's migration, which one?\n\n210\n00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.860\nWell, if you don't find out that\ninformation, then you might go, okay.\n\n211\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.419\nRemote move migration,\nthat would be best, and\n\n212\n00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:28.460\nthen Zack's running 2007 is not\ngoing to work very well for him.\n\n213\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.850\nSame thing with the cutover migration,\nnow, we normally, or I normally,\n\n214\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:33.650\nI should say.\n\n215\n00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.894\nI recommend this idea to cutover\nmigration, and that is because most\n\n216\n00:12:37.894 --> 00:12:43.175\npeople, in today's age, probably not\ngonna be running Exchange 2000, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:43.175 --> 00:12:47.817\nThe earliest you're probably gonna\nsee is Exchange 2003, and this one,\n\n218\n00:12:47.817 --> 00:12:51.810\nMike, essentially is kind of\nmy umbrella go to, right?\n\n219\n00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:56.500\nIf I don't know, okay, if they didn't\ntell me anything else, I'm gonna go,\n\n220\n00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.231\nwell, you might try\nthis cutover migration.\n\n221\n00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:01.840\nIt doesn't mean it's gonna be\nthe best options there, okay?\n\n222\n00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.660\nBut what I'm saying is, if I really\njust don't know, okay, this cutover,\n\n223\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.451\nlook, 2003 and later.\n\n224\n00:13:08.451 --> 00:13:13.323\nWell, that covers 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013,\n\n225\n00:13:13.323 --> 00:13:18.108\n2016, whatever the new versions are,\ncovers them all, and\n\n226\n00:13:18.108 --> 00:13:23.850\nI might go, that might actually\nbe one that really helps me out.\n\n227\n00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.790\nBut that's just a small part of it, right?\n\n228\n00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.100\nNow that is not gonna be something that\nyou might see on a Microsoft exam.\n\n229\n00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.440\nThey're not gonna make it that general,\nof course,\n\n230\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.280\nthis answer will fit every single\npossibility and scenarios.\n\n231\n00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.705\nBut I can see this in real life, right?\n\n232\n00:13:37.705 --> 00:13:42.080\nThat if I'm not sure which one,\nI might choose this cutover migration,\n\n233\n00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.880\nis what I would choose.\n\n234\n00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.702\nNow the other one, of course,\n\n235\n00:13:45.702 --> 00:13:50.272\nis this last one here where we talk\nabout the idea of IMAP, okay, migration.\n\n236\n00:13:50.272 --> 00:13:54.823\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of IMAP migration,\n\n237\n00:13:54.823 --> 00:13:59.476\nit says it is supported by Exchange and\nother email systems.\n\n238\n00:13:59.476 --> 00:14:03.470\nNow, this actually brings\nto us a good point as well.\n\n239\n00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.950\nIf now, inside of my organization,\nI'm running for, God forbid,\n\n240\n00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.540\nhopefully it doesn't happen this way,\nthere's something that we call\n\n241\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.745\na Dominos server, and in emails,\nyou don't wanna run it.\n\n242\n00:14:13.745 --> 00:14:15.632\n[LAUGH] You can, but\nyou don't want to run it.\n\n243\n00:14:15.632 --> 00:14:19.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For definitely sure there.\n\n244\n00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.430\nWell, more than likely,\n\n245\n00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.910\nthis is my only option that I have\navailable, is this IMAP one that's there.\n\n246\n00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.810\nIt's not a bad option, but\nit's just one that you've got to know.\n\n247\n00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.460\nThat these other three\nare probably not gonna be helpful\n\n248\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.260\nin terms of other email Exchange\nsystems that are out there.\n\n249\n00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.830\nBut it is possible if you choose to\ndo something like this as well, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.195\nNow the other thing that you\nalso want to pay attention to,\n\n251\n00:14:44.195 --> 00:14:48.580\nlet's see if we can select one and\nthen we'll go on out here.\n\n252\n00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.570\nSo at this point,\nnotice that on each one of these,\n\n253\n00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:56.290\nmake sure you also read through some\nof the different plans that you have\n\n254\n00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:00.550\nover on the right hand side that will help\nyou out with your deployment selection.\n\n255\n00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:05.090\nAnd it's really nice, so\nlet me see if I can zoom over here.\n\n256\n00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.620\nSo on the first one,\nwhich is the remote move,\n\n257\n00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.020\nselect this if you're planning\nan Exchange hybrid deployment.\n\n258\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.980\nSo there is another clue, if I know I'm\ngonna be keeping Exchange Online in my\n\n259\n00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:21.850\norganization, as well as Exchange Online,\nand so I said it both times.\n\n260\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.678\nExchange on-premises and Exchange Online\nis what I should have said, if I know I'm\n\n261\n00:15:26.678 --> 00:15:31.239\ngonna be doing that, more than likely,\nthis is the option I am going to choose.\n\n262\n00:15:31.239 --> 00:15:35.820\nSo here, you do actually have that option.\n\n263\n00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.760\nSo the great thing is it explains it for\nyou.\n\n264\n00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.930\nBut you'll not know this if you\nhaven't gone through these options.\n\n265\n00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.720\nIt's just not gonna help you out.\n\n266\n00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.850\nSo make sure that if you are preparing for\nthe exam, go through these and\n\n267\n00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.480\ntake a look.\n\n268\n00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.122\nAnd so let's see if we hover\nover this next one and\n\n269\n00:15:50.122 --> 00:15:52.383\nsee some of the other details here, too.\n\n270\n00:15:52.383 --> 00:15:56.858\nAnd this is great because it means you\nactually get to see it right here as well.\n\n271\n00:15:56.858 --> 00:16:00.641\nBut at the same time, it helps you\ncement this in your mind, right?\n\n272\n00:16:00.641 --> 00:16:04.162\nSelect this if you plan to migrate all.\n\n273\n00:16:04.162 --> 00:16:05.620\nSo notice that.\n\n274\n00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.880\nSo now Zach, if you kind of scenario\nlike things that would happen, right?\n\n275\n00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.178\nZach tells us or\nhe gives us the criteria, right?\n\n276\n00:16:13.178 --> 00:16:15.851\nHe's running Exchange 2007, but\n\n277\n00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:19.578\nhe plans to migrate everyone\nover to Exchange Online.\n\n278\n00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:22.944\nWell now all of a sudden\nthat actually says hey,\n\n279\n00:16:22.944 --> 00:16:27.066\nmaybe that is the one to do,\nwhich is the stage migration,\n\n280\n00:16:27.066 --> 00:16:32.160\nbecause this actually begins to meet\nthat requirement as well, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.500\nNow along with this, right, everything\nthat was up here in this paragraph about\n\n282\n00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.830\nhow long it will take, it absolutely comes\nin play with all of these other ones too.\n\n283\n00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:45.050\nNow on the cut over one, just so\nthat we know, this one as well it says,\n\n284\n00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.190\nmigrates all on premises\nto Exchange Online.\n\n285\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:55.230\nBut this one automatically starts\nto do just a little bit more.\n\n286\n00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.880\nAnd it even says here's the time period,\nover a few days.\n\n287\n00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.820\nThis one's designed for something, and\nthis is why I want to focus in on it more,\n\n288\n00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.400\nbecause this is the one we're\ngoing to spend more time on.\n\n289\n00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.070\nAll the mailboxes migrated\nin a single batch.\n\n290\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.570\nNow, that can be tough, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.140\nSo it says that you can do this.\n\n292\n00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.970\nA maximum of 2,000 mailboxes can\nbe migrated using this option.\n\n293\n00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.020\nSome organizations are larger than 2,000.\n\n294\n00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.950\nBut realistically,\nthe recommendation here and\n\n295\n00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.910\nalso is that you're not gonna\nbe able to do this 2,001 times.\n\n296\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.070\nSo realistically, probably about 150\naccounts at one time is probably the max.\n\n297\n00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:38.144\nAnd that's because you can bog down\nnot only your internal network but\n\n298\n00:17:38.144 --> 00:17:42.960\nalso the slow down of the Office\n365 systems out there you try and\n\n299\n00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.953\nsend 2000 at one time.\n\n300\n00:17:44.953 --> 00:17:48.790\nSo about 150 is probably actually\nthe one that you want to be able to do.\n\n301\n00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.560\nSo just kinda realize that\nthere are some limitations to\n\n302\n00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.040\neach one that you choose to do here,\nwhen you do that.\n\n303\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.790\nSo all of that goes into selecting\n\n304\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:04.060\na proper strategy that we have to\nthink about when we start to see this.\n\n305\n00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:09.080\nSo this one though is also limited\nthough in the amount of information\n\n306\n00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.510\nthat we also get.\n\n307\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.370\nSo even though this\nactually gives us the IMAP,\n\n308\n00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:19.190\ngives us the ability to have a copy of our\nold email system essentially brought in,\n\n309\n00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.740\nit doesn't copy everything over, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.590\nThis one is limited by whatever\nis actually inside of the,\n\n311\n00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.740\nif I remember correctly,\nI think just the mailbox itself as well.\n\n312\n00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:34.470\nYes, only copies over email data,\nI want to make sure I mention that too.\n\n313\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.480\nSo there are a lot of considerations\nwhen it comes down to\n\n314\n00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.400\ntaking a look at those strategies.\n\n315\n00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:47.130\nDo not rush through this thinking, I know.\n\n316\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.470\nI remember what Ronnie said.\n\n317\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.340\nIt's not enough.\n\n318\n00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.840\nYou've got to have this in your\nmind as you go into the exam or\n\n319\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.040\nit's not gonna be ready for you.\n\n320\n00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.449\nSo, let me select the cut over one for\nright now and click Next.\n\n321\n00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:01.820\nOnce you have that,\n\n322\n00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.940\nyou can now begin to create what's called\na New Migration Batch at this point too.\n\n323\n00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.750\nNow, this is actually very important\nwhen you start doing this.\n\n324\n00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.490\nBut the great thing is,\nit does it essentially all for\n\n325\n00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.260\nyou once you actually start adding\nin just a little bit of information.\n\n326\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.030\nYou have to actually enter in\nthe email address of one of\n\n327\n00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:24.340\nthe users in the on-premise mailbox that\nwill be migrated using this end point,\n\n328\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.000\nalso the name and the password.\n\n329\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.390\nRecommendation here is\ncreate a test mailbox.\n\n330\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.090\nAdd a few pieces of email in,\nmake sure you get some junk mail.\n\n331\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.980\nMake sure you do whatever you're\nnormally gonna migrate over there.\n\n332\n00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.690\nDo not do this with somebody's real\ndata at the very beginning, but\n\n333\n00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.610\nmake sure you actually do add that\nin there if you're going to do this.\n\n334\n00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.060\nAnd then this way you can\ntest with that particular\n\n335\n00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.120\naccount is what you want to be able to do.\n\n336\n00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.530\nOops, it's saying I have\nto actually do this.\n\n337\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.630\nSo, let's see.\n\n338\n00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:05.487\nLet's do We just do Roonie@,\n\n339\n00:20:05.487 --> 00:20:09.798\nI have to do the, let's try this.\n\n340\n00:20:09.798 --> 00:20:14.153\nLet's try, itprotvdemo.net.\n\n341\n00:20:14.153 --> 00:20:20.554\nAnd then the account with\nprivileges we'll do ITproTVdemo,\n\n342\n00:20:20.554 --> 00:20:25.420\nI'm just doing the pre 2000 for Ronnie.\n\n343\n00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.680\nAnd then the password,\nI'm just making up a password.\n\n344\n00:20:33.656 --> 00:20:36.210\nAll right, then I can click Next.\n\n345\n00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.100\nNow, once we have that here\nare a couple of other things.\n\n346\n00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.070\nNow this where I'll probably have\nto kind of end our little charade,\n\n347\n00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.840\nbecause at this point, right, because it's\nthinking that we are actually going to do\n\n348\n00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:54.200\na migration over here it's going\nto try and reach out across\n\n349\n00:20:54.200 --> 00:21:01.420\nthe Internet from Office 365, back down\nto my actual exchange server where I am.\n\n350\n00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.760\nSo it's asking, provide for\n\n351\n00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.400\nme that exchange server as well\nas the RFPC proxy server, too.\n\n352\n00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.360\nSometimes it's gonna be exactly\nthe same for your organization.\n\n353\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.740\nSometimes it may be different.\n\n354\n00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.636\nBut just kind of remember, it's asking for\n\n355\n00:21:13.636 --> 00:21:16.567\nyour fully qualified domain name\nat this particular point in time.\n\n356\n00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:19.838\nAny other things that it might ask for,\nyou can click on more and\n\n357\n00:21:19.838 --> 00:21:24.900\nthe authentication, whether it's gonna be\nbasic or NTLM, you have that ability here.\n\n358\n00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.780\nBut that's pretty much about what we have,\nokay?\n\n359\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.610\nNow once it actually gets through\nthis point it will then go and\n\n360\n00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.460\ncheck, make sure everything is done.\n\n361\n00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.340\nFrom that point, you'll either be able\nto select individual mailboxes, or\n\n362\n00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.510\na group of those.\n\n363\n00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.840\nWhen it actually populates\nyour list of 2,000,\n\n364\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.230\nyou might actually say I don't want all\n2,000, let me select 150 at a time.\n\n365\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.700\nThen from that point, you allow it\nto do everything it needs to do, and\n\n366\n00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.440\nit will actually do the connection that\nwe need it to actually be able to do.\n\n367\n00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.890\nBut just kinda realize that from that\npoint there it is gonna be where\n\n368\n00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:02.930\nthe wizard itself will essentially\nwalk through everything, and\n\n369\n00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.890\nthen you can start all over again.\n\n370\n00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.475\nSo even in the middle of that\nprocess you can come back here and\n\n371\n00:22:08.475 --> 00:22:11.720\ncreate a second batch for\nyour second batch of 150 or\n\n372\n00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.110\nso, and be able to continue on and\ndo everything that we want to, okay?\n\n373\n00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.300\nSo, that is actually\ngonna be very important,\n\n374\n00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.930\nin terms of that process and that time.\n\n375\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.382\nNow, the other part,\nanother criteria I wanna make sure that we\n\n376\n00:22:26.382 --> 00:22:31.012\nmention too is that idea of\nthe off-boarding, just for a moment.\n\n377\n00:22:31.012 --> 00:22:35.710\nIf you or your organization, right,\nis now deciding that it's time for\n\n378\n00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.030\noff boarding,\nlet's go back to the machine here.\n\n379\n00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:44.741\nNow we wanna take a look at\nthis particular selection,\n\n380\n00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:48.362\nwhich is to Migrate from Exchange Online.\n\n381\n00:22:48.362 --> 00:22:52.438\nAnd you'll see it will pretty much\nlook just about the same here, but\n\n382\n00:22:52.438 --> 00:22:54.930\nnow look at what's happening instead.\n\n383\n00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.502\nWhere it says, hey, here's what you\nactually want to be able to do.\n\n384\n00:22:58.502 --> 00:23:01.867\nIf your organization,\nof course, has users it will\n\n385\n00:23:01.867 --> 00:23:06.236\npopulate the users that you want\nto move to another system instead.\n\n386\n00:23:06.236 --> 00:23:11.360\nOr you can create your own CSV file and\nthat way do that.\n\n387\n00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.810\nNow, you might be wondering, why would\nI choose to do a CSV file instead of\n\n388\n00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.865\njust individually clicking on\nall the names that I want to do?\n\n389\n00:23:18.865 --> 00:23:21.660\nWell this is a one at a time thing.\n\n390\n00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:27.190\nWhereas in the CSV file though,\nI can probably go to HR and\n\n391\n00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.480\nget a record of the files that I want, or\n\n392\n00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:35.060\nthe email boxes that I want to be able\nto move inside of an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n393\n00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.310\nI can change that to a comma\nseparated values spreadsheet and\n\n394\n00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.440\nessentially upload it here.\n\n395\n00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.595\nAnd that way I can get my 150,\n200 email boxes right away and\n\n396\n00:23:46.595 --> 00:23:52.244\nbe able to actually have that ready\nto go for that offloading to do that.\n\n397\n00:23:52.244 --> 00:23:54.216\nNow when we select that offloading,\n\n398\n00:23:54.216 --> 00:23:57.533\nyeah offloading I mean make\nsure I'm saying that correctly.\n\n399\n00:23:57.533 --> 00:24:00.086\nOff boarding is the proper term [LAUGH].\n\n400\n00:24:00.086 --> 00:24:02.249\nThe off boarding migration here.\n\n401\n00:24:02.249 --> 00:24:06.363\nIt is also normally done\nunderneath that remote move too.\n\n402\n00:24:06.363 --> 00:24:11.163\nSo on all those strategies, whether\nwe're talking about the remote move or\n\n403\n00:24:11.163 --> 00:24:15.888\nwhether we're talking about a stage or\ncut over or even the iMap settings,\n\n404\n00:24:15.888 --> 00:24:19.540\nany of those that we're\nactually talking about.\n\n405\n00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.210\nYou want to make sure that\nyou do remember that it\n\n406\n00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.860\nincludes a lot more than just\nsaying that sounds fancy.\n\n407\n00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.790\nWe need to know what Exchange we're\nactually running if we're doing the on\n\n408\n00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.200\nboarding process.\n\n409\n00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.550\nWe also need to know how long\nthat we're expecting it to take.\n\n410\n00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.326\nWe need to understand the size that\nwe're actually migrating up there.\n\n411\n00:24:37.326 --> 00:24:38.121\nAnd whether or\n\n412\n00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:41.837\nnot any of the other features that\nwe have to have available there.\n\n413\n00:24:41.837 --> 00:24:45.230\nBut make sure you go through that Wizard,\nand that will help you out.\n\n414\n00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.900\nAnd if you want to be able to off-board,\nmake sure you also understand this\n\n415\n00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.690\nprocess, that it begins with\nactually either a CSV file,\n\n416\n00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:56.240\nor you're gonna choose the proper names\nthat you're going to off-board as well.\n\n417\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.070\nThat way you're gonna transfer it to\nanother system at some other point in\n\n418\n00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.330\ntime too.\n\n419\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.930\nSo, taking a look at something like\nthat is really gonna be important for\n\n420\n00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:09.870\nus when it comes down to the exam itself,\nokay?\n\n421\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.810\nAnd more than likely, if you can get that\nand you can start thinking in scenarios\n\n422\n00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:18.350\nahead of time, and say all right,\nhere's when I would choose cut over.\n\n423\n00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.370\nHere's when I would choose stage.\n\n424\n00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:23.495\nHere's when I would\nchoose the remote move.\n\n425\n00:25:23.495 --> 00:25:26.910\nThat's going to help you\nout tremendously for\n\n426\n00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:30.980\nthe exam itself and in real life because\nyou'll actually be able to know which\n\n427\n00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.650\nones you're going to choose right away.\n\n428\n00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:36.820\nSo in the GUI, the great thing is it's\npretty much the same for each one, there's\n\n429\n00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:42.630\nnot a ton of differences when it comes\ndown to the way that's going to happen.\n\n430\n00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.870\nAnd when we get into the PowerShell,\nwe're gonna see the same thing too.\n\n431\n00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:50.330\nWe are almost using identical,\nalmost identical wording to it.\n\n432\n00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.580\nSo what we're going to do is we\nare going to show you at least,\n\n433\n00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.188\nsome of the syntax for one of them so\nthat you can understand the process.\n\n434\n00:25:58.188 --> 00:26:00.540\nAnd we'll kinda take you\nthrough that process too.\n\n435\n00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:04.450\nAnd we're not gonna do the entirety\nof everything because, well,\n\n436\n00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.390\nI don't really have an Exchange Server\nset up with a ton of data.\n\n437\n00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:11.270\nBut we will at least show you\nthe PowerShell and why these particular\n\n438\n00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.240\ncommands are gonna be very important for\nus as we get through that.\n\n439\n00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.820\nBut Zach, I think I'm actually\nout of time at this point.\n\n440\n00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:21.860\nI have talked a tremendous amount just\ntrying to get this information in.\n\n441\n00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.500\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe have great understanding about why now\n\n442\n00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.090\nwe would want to migrate our mailboxes and\n\n443\n00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:31.685\nthere will be more as we continue with\nmailbox migration strategy part two.\n\n444\n00:26:31.685 --> 00:26:32.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n445\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.560\nyou want to make sure you stay tuned for\nthat.\n\n446\n00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.550\nWell, I'm Zach Memos your host for\nEnabling Office 365 Services.\n\n447\n00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.570\nAnd thank you for watching

00:00:08.246\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.246 --> 00:00:11.705\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:14.719\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITPro.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.289\nwhere we help you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.093\nI'm your host Zach Memos, for\nenabling Office 365 Services,\n\n8\n00:00:22.093 --> 00:00:26.911\nas we continue with mailbox\nmigration strategy with Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:27.780\nHey, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.830\n&gt;&gt; How are you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n12\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.670\nNow, in this particular episode or\nsegment, depending on how you look at it,\n\n13\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.690\nwe're gonna be looking at PowerShell and\nhow PowerShell can help us do just that.\n\n14\n00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the very fact is we\nalready have seen in our part one,\n\n15\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.570\nwhere we can take advantage of the web UI.\n\n16\n00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.280\nTo get us where we need to go.\n\n17\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.780\nAnd that normally is gonna work for\nthe majority of what we need to do.\n\n18\n00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.044\nBut at the same time,\nsometimes what we want to do of course,\n\n19\n00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:54.651\nis be able to script this out.\n\n20\n00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:58.082\nSo that we can run it as a single\nPowerShell script if we want to.\n\n21\n00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:00.818\nBut at the same time, it's something\nyou're gonna need to know and\n\n22\n00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:02.080\nneed to get used to.\n\n23\n00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.240\nMore and more, Office 365 and\n\n24\n00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.140\nother products out there, we're gonna be\ndepending on the PowerShell even more.\n\n25\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.770\nSo even this entire process, you'll gonna\nsee there's a lot of different PowerShell\n\n26\n00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.860\ncommands that we have to take a look at.\n\n27\n00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.500\nSo, I wanna go ahead and\nprocess this right at the beginning.\n\n28\n00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.820\nEven though more than likely\nbecause of the complexity and\n\n29\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.230\nthe depth of it ,you're not\nlikely to see it on the exam.\n\n30\n00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.940\nI can't tell you you\nwon't see it on the exam.\n\n31\n00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.100\nBut the key here,\n\n32\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.585\nis to make sure that you understand\nit can also be done in PowerShell.\n\n33\n00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:36.895\nAnd take a note at what we're\nactually doing in PowerShell,\n\n34\n00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:38.935\nas we start doing this.\n\n35\n00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:43.329\nSo, we're gonna essentially pick one of\nthose methodologies that we've talked\n\n36\n00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.357\nabout in part one.\n\n37\n00:01:44.357 --> 00:01:48.103\nThe remote, move,\n[LAUGH] the cutover, the stage and\n\n38\n00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:51.861\nthe iMap setting,\nwe're gonna choose the cutover.\n\n39\n00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:55.200\nAnd we're gonna show you how to run\nthat through inside of PowerShell.\n\n40\n00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.290\nThe reason why is that the majority of\nthem just like inside of GUI, they really\n\n41\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.790\ndo use the same commands, but then\nthere's a few options that are different.\n\n42\n00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.390\nAnd that's the only thing you really\nneed to know is that there are different\n\n43\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.760\noptions that are in there, but\n\n44\n00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.660\nthe commands are basically the same when\nit comes down to any way that you do it.\n\n45\n00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.970\nSo I'm gonna choose cutover,\nbecause that's by far the most common.\n\n46\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.020\nThe one that's gonna be used whether\nyou're talking about 150 users\n\n47\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.950\nto 2,000 users as well.\n\n48\n00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.330\nAnd even though it might actually do\nsmaller batches at one time, it will give\n\n49\n00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.630\nyou the completeness that you need without\nactually kind of all at one time hoping\n\n50\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.860\nthat everything works well, it's staged\nout for us fairly well which is good.\n\n51\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.330\nSo that normally will cover our strategy,\n\n52\n00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.080\nas far as making sure that we're migrating\ncompletely over to Exchange Online.\n\n53\n00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.640\nDon't get me wrong if you're still\ndoing the hybrid environment,\n\n54\n00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.280\nit's gonna be a little bit different.\n\n55\n00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.270\nBut at least in this point you'll\nget the understanding, and\n\n56\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.580\nyou'll understand what\nwe'll have to do here.\n\n57\n00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.460\nSo, what we're going to do because it\ndoes require a full exchange server to\n\n58\n00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.490\nbe set up, with users and\nwith mailboxes and everything set up.\n\n59\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.350\nWell, I don't have that.\n\n60\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.000\nNow if you want to get in that and\nwe do this entire setup here,\n\n61\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.268\nabout the migration strategies and\neverything inside of\n\n62\n00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:17.330\nthe Exchange 70-345 episode, are shows\nthat are out there with Brian Swittergall.\n\n63\n00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.740\nSo make sure you check those shows out,\ntoo.\n\n64\n00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.630\nBut here, we're at least talking about the\nbasic process because even there, there's\n\n65\n00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.890\nmigration strategies and there you go\nmuch more in depth into Exchange itself.\n\n66\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.330\nBut, here's kinda the basic\nsteps as we were migrating over.\n\n67\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.850\nWe wanna make sure that we\ninclude all of those in here.\n\n68\n00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.220\nSo right at the beginning as we start off,\n\n69\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.660\nlet me show you where you\nhave to start off here.\n\n70\n00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.430\nWhich is inside of the web UI briefly.\n\n71\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.782\nIf you are going to set up for Exchange\nto be essentially your email server,\n\n72\n00:03:47.782 --> 00:03:52.420\nyou wanna make sure that you go\ninto the Office Admin Center.\n\n73\n00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.860\nAnd once you get into\nthe Office Admin Center,\n\n74\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.880\nyou are going to set up your domain.\n\n75\n00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.260\nIn other words,\nthe domain that your already having for\n\n76\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.940\nyour On-premises Exchange Server.\n\n77\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.090\nOver on the left hand side, I'm going to\nscroll down to where I have this gear for\n\n78\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.141\nsettings, and then it's gonna be domains.\n\n79\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.552\nOnce I select that.\n\n80\n00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.261\nAnd in a moment you should see I have\na couple domains pop up here, and\n\n81\n00:04:18.261 --> 00:04:21.890\nnow of course it's kind of\nhesitating as I'm showing you.\n\n82\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.660\nAll you have to do is\nadd your domain in here.\n\n83\n00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.804\nAnd this is the one that's gonna be for\n\n84\n00:04:26.804 --> 00:04:29.691\nwhat you're hosting on\nyour own Exchange Server.\n\n85\n00:04:29.691 --> 00:04:33.910\nNow, that actually gives you a couple\nof things that you'll have to do.\n\n86\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.106\nAnd let me get to this point, where as\nwe add in a domain it's gonna say hey,\n\n87\n00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:39.718\nenter a domain that you own.\n\n88\n00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:42.484\nAnd this is where you'll\nenter in your domain.\n\n89\n00:04:42.484 --> 00:04:46.290\nFrom that point,\nit's gonna try to verify your domain.\n\n90\n00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.050\nNow, how does it do that?\n\n91\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:55.210\nIt creates a little, the values for what\nwe call a TXT record in your DNS for you.\n\n92\n00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.160\nSo in other words,\nyou'll open up your DNS registrars for\n\n93\n00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.620\nyour domain, and\nyou'll add that in as a text value.\n\n94\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.670\nAnd then once you do that, you'll come\nback and you'll click Next to verify.\n\n95\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.120\nAnd then from that point,\nOffice 365 will verify that and\n\n96\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.760\nbegin to set up your online services.\n\n97\n00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.680\nAnd then at that point, make sure that you\nget all of the settings that you need.\n\n98\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.180\nNow, I've already done this with this\ndomain right here, in itprotv.demo.net.\n\n99\n00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.490\nIn the end, you'll end up seeing what\ntells you everything has been successfully\n\n100\n00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.550\nadded, and\nyou'll get these settings right.\n\n101\n00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.260\nEverything that you need to make sure\nthat for having a Cloud service and\n\n102\n00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.520\nyou need to connect Office 365, you'll\nget all of these different settings here.\n\n103\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.440\nThe one that we're gonna look at later on\nafter we finish everything, is gonna of\n\n104\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.140\ncourse be these records right here, that\nwe need to add into our DNS registrar.\n\n105\n00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.740\nWhich are gonna be these three records\nhere, and we'll simply add those in.\n\n106\n00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.380\nAnd then once you're actually done,\nthat's what will happen.\n\n107\n00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.520\nSo at least there,\nthat's what you'll have.\n\n108\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.930\nSo you don't have to guess what\nthose records are gonna be,\n\n109\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.370\nit tells you exactly what those\nrecords are which is really nice.\n\n110\n00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.140\nInstead of you just waiting,\nand waiting, and waiting.\n\n111\n00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.409\nBut overall though, that's a simple part.\n\n112\n00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:13.294\nYou gotta make sure at least\nat the very beginning here,\n\n113\n00:06:13.294 --> 00:06:15.776\nthat your Exchange On-premises,\n\n114\n00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:21.160\nthat that domain is also gonna be\nmanaged right here inside of Office 365.\n\n115\n00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.470\nIf that doesn't work, then it's not\ngoing to actually help you out.\n\n116\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.200\nNow, once you do this, the 2nd thing\nthat you also have to have as far as on\n\n117\n00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.380\nyour Exchange Server, before you\neven begin to talk about migrating.\n\n118\n00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.400\nIs that your Exchange Server and\nthis should be this way anyways,\n\n119\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.110\nis that you already have\na third-party certificate on it,\n\n120\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.710\nwhich means that it's not\na self-signed certificate.\n\n121\n00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.360\nIf it's a self-signed certificate,\nit's not going to work.\n\n122\n00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.530\nSo, again, that actually sounds like, that\nsounds like a testable question there.\n\n123\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.993\nWhy is my Exchange Migration failing?\n\n124\n00:06:54.993 --> 00:06:56.512\nAnd they give you some\nof the requirements,\n\n125\n00:06:56.512 --> 00:06:58.496\nsuch as I've got my self-signed\ncertificate on there.\n\n126\n00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:01.750\nAnd you go a self-signed certificate,\nwell that doesn't work.\n\n127\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.530\nSo it has to be a verifiable third-party\ntrusted certificate authority,\n\n128\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.260\nis gonna have a certificate\non there as well.\n\n129\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.780\nNow, once that's done and you have\nat least those basic requirements,\n\n130\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.190\nthat is when we can go into\nPowerShell to do the rest.\n\n131\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.963\nNow that of course means that you can\nconnect to the PowerShell online, and\n\n132\n00:07:22.963 --> 00:07:25.631\nlet's see if I'm still connected here.\n\n133\n00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:31.908\nSo here I am still open and available,\nand I am still connected to exchange, and\n\n134\n00:07:31.908 --> 00:07:33.370\nthat is what we want.\n\n135\n00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.540\nWe wanna be able to do this.\n\n136\n00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.840\nNow, when you run this,\nyou wanna make sure that you're actually\n\n137\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.090\nrunning it from one of\ntwo locations there.\n\n138\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.080\nEither on the server that\nyou're migrating over,\n\n139\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.930\nor you're at least within that domain\nthat you're also migrating over.\n\n140\n00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.012\nSo you want to make sure that you're\nrunning this in one of those two\n\n141\n00:07:52.012 --> 00:07:52.625\nlocations.\n\n142\n00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:54.965\nDon't run it from your home computer,\nis what I'm saying.\n\n143\n00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:58.340\nMake sure you're actually part of\nthat domain as you run this, and\n\n144\n00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.678\nthat you're ready to go.\n\n145\n00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:04.266\nNow, once that's done, I'm now just gonna\nshow you a list of PowerShell commands,\n\n146\n00:08:04.266 --> 00:08:09.250\nand now your eyes are gonna go, gosh, and\nthey're gonna cross a little bit here.\n\n147\n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.460\nBut this is what has to happen, and\nwe'll walk through each one of these, and\n\n148\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.920\nI'll highlight them as we go through.\n\n149\n00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.146\nAt the beginning, make sure you set up\nthe credentials you're gonna be using\n\n150\n00:08:19.146 --> 00:08:20.920\nthroughout everything.\n\n151\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:26.400\nAnd there is a specific type of\nadministrator, if you wanna call him that.\n\n152\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.410\nMake sure I actually tell\nyou the right name for this.\n\n153\n00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:33.210\nIt's called the migration\nadministrator permissions, right?\n\n154\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.450\nSo whoever is gonna be your\nmigration administrator,\n\n155\n00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.718\nuse his credentials when you do this.\n\n156\n00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:42.420\nSo you wanna set up this variable here,\n\n157\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.110\nbecause we're gonna be using\nthis a couple of times\n\n158\n00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.730\nthroughout these different PowerShell\ncommands that we're going to run.\n\n159\n00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:55.070\nSo once you actually set up that migration\nadministrator, that's what you wanna do.\n\n160\n00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:00.530\nThe migration administrator,\nhe can be one of three things here, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:05.060\nSo regardless of whose account that you\nchoose, if he's gonna be your migration\n\n162\n00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.250\nadministrator to handle the rest of this,\nhe can be a domain admin.\n\n163\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.991\nMost of us don't want that, though.\n\n164\n00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:13.760\nWe don't him to have access\nto the entire domain.\n\n165\n00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.390\nBut if you want him to be\na domain admin's credentials\n\n166\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.740\nwith what they have privileges to,\nwill work in what we're about to do.\n\n167\n00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.353\nOr you have to be willing to go in and\ngive this particular\n\n168\n00:09:26.353 --> 00:09:31.830\nuser full access to every mail\nbox he is going to migrate.\n\n169\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.820\nSo you actually can do\nthat if you choose to.\n\n170\n00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.560\nThat's a lot of adding, but\nit can be done that way.\n\n171\n00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:44.360\nOr, if you kinda think about it,\nyou can actually just make him, instead,\n\n172\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:51.110\na receive as permissions on\nthe actual mailbox database itself.\n\n173\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.250\nSo that has to be there.\n\n174\n00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.590\nSo when you create that first idea of\nbeing that variable with those credentials\n\n175\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.060\nup there, he needs to be that\nmigration administrator.\n\n176\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.790\nEither the domain admin or\n\n177\n00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.390\nhave full access on every mailbox\nthat he's migrating over.\n\n178\n00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:11.340\nOr he has to be able to have receive\nas permissions on the mailbox database.\n\n179\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.550\nThose are kinda the only options that\nare there for you to be able to do that.\n\n180\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:21.720\nSo I'm mentioning that once again, also,\njust in case it appears on the exam.\n\n181\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.220\nIt can be a very easy question on why\nthe credentials aren't working for\n\n182\n00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.429\nthis person that you've given read\nonly access to the mailboxes.\n\n183\n00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:34.299\nOr they're not a domain admin,\nor whatever it might be,\n\n184\n00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:37.270\nthese are great scenario questions.\n\n185\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.850\nCuz Microsoft really loves\npermissions to really be the issue.\n\n186\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.210\nIf they can limit it to that,\nthat's exactly what they can try and do.\n\n187\n00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:49.850\nSo just kinda make sure that you pay\nattention as we start to take a look at.\n\n188\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.090\nNow once that's done,\nyou also need to make sure,\n\n189\n00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.200\nif you're not already,\nmost organizations are, that\n\n190\n00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:02.700\nyou already have what we call\nOutlook Anywhere enabled on your Exchange.\n\n191\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.370\nAnd that normally gives you that ability,\nright, the OWA,\n\n192\n00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.700\nOutlook Anywhere, is what we also have,\nor Outlook Web Access.\n\n193\n00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.040\nBut it essentially allows us to be able to\nconnect from the outside into our Exchange\n\n194\n00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.100\nservers here.\n\n195\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.700\nYou wanna make sure, of course,\nthat that is enabled.\n\n196\n00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.240\nIf it's not, well then,\nit's gonna be very difficult for\n\n197\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.510\nOffice 365 to communicate with\nyour Exchange on-premises server.\n\n198\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.860\nSo how do we begin that?\n\n199\n00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.370\nWell, let's test it out.\n\n200\n00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:28.150\nOnce it's enabled,\n\n201\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.690\nhere's the command that you want to make\nsure that you run to test it out here.\n\n202\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.552\nNow let me see,\nif I zoom out just a little bit here, So\n\n203\n00:11:37.552 --> 00:11:44.388\nit is test migration server availability,\nExchange, Outlook Anywhere.\n\n204\n00:11:44.388 --> 00:11:46.700\nWell, we're gonna tell it\nto use the auto discover.\n\n205\n00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.140\nAuto discover is,\nat this point, your best friend\n\n206\n00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.596\nbecause it means I don't manually have\nto type in server names anymore, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:53.596 --> 00:11:59.150\nSo use auto discover, find the Exchange\nserver, please, let's do that.\n\n208\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:03.390\nAnd of course, the email address,\nthe email address, this would be your\n\n209\n00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:10.330\nmigration administrator's email\naddress and his credentials, okay?\n\n210\n00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.560\nNow if you come back, and it tells you\nit's failed, that means something in those\n\n211\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:20.050\npermissions aren't set up correctly,\nor it's not actually on.\n\n212\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:24.110\nSo make sure you get that up and\ntested and ready to go.\n\n213\n00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.880\nThe reason why you want that is\nbecause that becomes a primary step\n\n214\n00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.700\nin what we need to do next, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.230\nIf it all tests out right, and\nyou actually are ready to go,\n\n216\n00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.986\nthat means you can move\ninto the next step here.\n\n217\n00:12:37.986 --> 00:12:42.912\nWhere we have to make sure that\nOffice 365 can communicate\n\n218\n00:12:42.912 --> 00:12:47.490\nwith our own on-premises Exchange here,\nokay?\n\n219\n00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:52.706\nAnd the way that we do that is by\nusing essentially the test here.\n\n220\n00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:56.948\nVerifying that that works,\nwe can now go ahead and\n\n221\n00:12:56.948 --> 00:13:00.591\ncreate a variable for that same test here.\n\n222\n00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:07.040\nThen I am now going to create my endpoint,\nnew migration endpoint.\n\n223\n00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.210\nIn other words,\nwhere am I getting the information from?\n\n224\n00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.655\nAnd this one is actually telling\nus that our new endpoint is gonna\n\n225\n00:13:14.655 --> 00:13:17.134\nbe an Exchange Anywhere endpoint.\n\n226\n00:13:17.134 --> 00:13:22.150\nWe're gonna call this particular migration\npoint here our cutover endpoint.\n\n227\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.880\nThen on the connection, in other words,\n\n228\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.490\nhow are we gonna connect\nin to the Exchange server?\n\n229\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.650\nWe're going to use\nthe Outlook Anywhere setting,\n\n230\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.050\nso I have it all stored on this variable.\n\n231\n00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:39.050\nSo this entire command up here that we\nran at the beginning testing it out,\n\n232\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:43.740\nwe're saying take those settings that we\nverified and essentially use that for\n\n233\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.840\nour connection settings,\nis what we're going to do.\n\n234\n00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.500\nSo if that figures out, and\nwe now have created an endpoint and\n\n235\n00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.590\neverything is up and going,\nthis is where, once it's all done,\n\n236\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.950\nmake sure I'm actually not\nglossing over anything here.\n\n237\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.843\nThis particular command here verifies,\n\n238\n00:14:07.164 --> 00:14:11.720\nOkay, oops, my mouse gets locked\nup every once in a while.\n\n239\n00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.900\nThis command right here verifies\n\n240\n00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.980\nthat everything is working\nthe way that it should.\n\n241\n00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.910\nSo we get the migration endpoint.\n\n242\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.703\nWe verify that it is the one\nthat's endpoint, and\n\n243\n00:14:23.703 --> 00:14:26.642\nit formats it to where it\ntells us the endpoint type.\n\n244\n00:14:26.642 --> 00:14:30.337\nIt gives us the Exchange server name,\nthat we're using auto discover, and\n\n245\n00:14:30.337 --> 00:14:33.350\nthen whatever the maximum\nnumber actually is.\n\n246\n00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:38.260\nIt's actually missing one thing here,\nwhich is an asterisk here at the very end.\n\n247\n00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.900\nSo it actually means give me everything\nthat actually begins with MAX,\n\n248\n00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.570\nanything that follows that, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.480\nSo we also will have that.\n\n250\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.610\nSo that is kinda the process, is now we've\nestablished our endpoint, once we have our\n\n251\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:57.290\nendpoint then, we can now begin this\nprocess of creating a migration batch.\n\n252\n00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.490\nMigration batch is exactly\nlike it sounds like.\n\n253\n00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.020\nHere are the batch of\nusers that I want to use.\n\n254\n00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.530\nYou've got two things that you have to do.\n\n255\n00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.730\nYou not only have to create that batch,\nyou also have to tell it to start.\n\n256\n00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.800\nSo, this is two different things here,\nokay?\n\n257\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.660\nNow, I have an or\nright here in the middle.\n\n258\n00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.690\nIf I run this command,\n\n259\n00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.820\nthe key here is at the very end of\nwhat you see, where it says autostart.\n\n260\n00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.800\nThis one's essentially\nsaying create the batch, but\n\n261\n00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.288\nautomatically start the batch as well,\nokay?\n\n262\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.270\nSo if you're missing the autostart though,\nthat means you can create the batch,\n\n263\n00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.260\nnothing is gonna happen.\n\n264\n00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.867\nIt's not gonna start the migration\nprocess, it's not gonna do that,\n\n265\n00:15:36.867 --> 00:15:38.318\nit's just gonna sit there.\n\n266\n00:15:38.318 --> 00:15:45.424\nBut you can also do this one instead,\nwhich says start the migration batch,\n\n267\n00:15:45.424 --> 00:15:50.435\nwhich will create it and\ngive it this name too, okay?\n\n268\n00:15:50.435 --> 00:15:52.879\nSo that will also allow you to do that.\n\n269\n00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:56.554\nNow this cutover batch,\nright You've already gone ahead and\n\n270\n00:15:56.554 --> 00:15:59.108\ncreated that new migration batch to do so.\n\n271\n00:15:59.108 --> 00:16:01.880\nSo this is where you'd actually do that.\n\n272\n00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.550\nAnd then, of course, you can verify\nthat everything is ready to go.\n\n273\n00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.780\nMake sure that the status is good,\nand then you're off.\n\n274\n00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.770\nAnd now that everything is set up, and\n\n275\n00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.860\nyou've now got your first\nsuccessful batch in.\n\n276\n00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.340\nIt doesn't mean that everything\nis ready for email to come in.\n\n277\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.380\nThis is when you have to make sure\nthat your email now gets routed over\n\n278\n00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.950\nto Office 365.\n\n279\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.270\nSo let's take, for an example,\n\n280\n00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:31.500\nthat you're actually running\nyour DNS registrar, right?\n\n281\n00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.390\nOn GoDaddy, okay,\nif that's what you're doing.\n\n282\n00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.840\nAnd your GoDaddy email records\nare pointed to your Online Exchange,\n\n283\n00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.470\nor your on-premises Exchange Server.\n\n284\n00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:48.310\nWell, that's when you come\nback into the web UI again.\n\n285\n00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:54.440\nYou select your own domain, and\nthis is where you pull the drop-down.\n\n286\n00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.540\nAnd it's right here,\n\n287\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:01.150\nthat you actually add in these additional\nrecords into your DNS registrar.\n\n288\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.680\nSo, just fill them out\nwith the same information.\n\n289\n00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.030\nAnd then you'll have to wait\n\n290\n00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:11.620\nanywhere between 24 to 48 hours for\nit to populate throughout, essentially.\n\n291\n00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.960\nThrough all the DNS servers that\nare publically available out there.\n\n292\n00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.820\nSo it's gonna take a bit of\ntime before that publishes out.\n\n293\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.120\nEvery once in a while, it will\npublish out much quicker than that.\n\n294\n00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.800\nBut give it 28 to 48 hours,\nto make sure that you're doing all that.\n\n295\n00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.450\nSo once we get everything set\nup at that point, to do that.\n\n296\n00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:38.110\nYou're now just about ready to essentially\nfinish all the batches that you have.\n\n297\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.960\nNow, if you have multiple batches,\nyou wanna make sure that they all finish.\n\n298\n00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.900\nBut if you're just testing it out,\nyou wanna delete\n\n299\n00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.460\nthat particular batch that has finished\nnow, and that you have migrated over.\n\n300\n00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.380\nBut before you do so,\nmake sure that you verify.\n\n301\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.610\nThat all of your users that you've\nexpected to be on Office 365, for\n\n302\n00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.570\ntheir email is on Office 365.\n\n303\n00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.200\nMake sure that that's done.\n\n304\n00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.860\nThen you can have them verify\nin their own email account,\n\n305\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.830\nif they have synchronized\ntheir information.\n\n306\n00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.610\nUsually, what happens, right,\n\n307\n00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:17.440\nis that it should synchronize at least\none time after they've migrated over.\n\n308\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.900\nBecause they know that there is\ngoing to be email that is between,\n\n309\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.710\nwhere it might be using\nthe old DNS records.\n\n310\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.105\nAnd then of course the new DNS records,\nwhere essentially,\n\n311\n00:18:29.105 --> 00:18:32.590\nZack's sending me two\nemails over two days.\n\n312\n00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.370\nOne could head to the old,\non-premises Exchange Server, and\n\n313\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.030\nthen get routed to me.\n\n314\n00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.510\nOr as he sends in the second,\nor maybe let's say,\n\n315\n00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.530\nit's even thirty minutes apart,\nthat he hits it at the right time.\n\n316\n00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.170\nIt routes it and\n\n317\n00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.700\nit says, you're supposed to go to\nExchange Online for Ronnie's domain.\n\n318\n00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.520\nAnd then it gets routed to me.\n\n319\n00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.910\nWell, we want to make sure that\nafter everybody is over there,\n\n320\n00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.620\nthat our inboxes are synchronized\nat least one time after that.\n\n321\n00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.520\nVerify that it has, if it has, now,\n\n322\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.610\nthat is when you can remove\nyour migration batch.\n\n323\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.909\nAnd everything is pretty much, at that\npoint, should be set up and ready to go.\n\n324\n00:19:14.767 --> 00:19:18.940\nNow, we're not done, I wish I could\ntell you that that was pretty much it.\n\n325\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.500\nBut that's kind of the basics,\n\n326\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.770\nin terms of the PowerShell\ninformation that we'll need.\n\n327\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.130\nNow if you're going, I'm not gonna\nremember any of that, Ronnie.\n\n328\n00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.650\nWell, the good thing is\nit's in the show notes,\n\n329\n00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.660\nyou'll be able to actually\nsee that along there.\n\n330\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.840\nBut the other thing, of course,\n\n331\n00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.500\nis even though you've now\ncreated accounts up there.\n\n332\n00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.770\nIt doesn't mean that every single\naccount that you've created\n\n333\n00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.270\nhas an email subscription attached to it.\n\n334\n00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:45.560\nSo this is when you now have\nto assign user licenses,\n\n335\n00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:51.430\nto be able to access those emails.\n\n336\n00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:55.530\nSo if they don't have user licenses,\nthen they won't be able to access it.\n\n337\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.050\nSo you'll still have to\nactually create those, and\n\n338\n00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.090\nmake sure that they get\nattached to licenses too.\n\n339\n00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:04.410\nThe last little bit of information, is at\nthis point, if everything is not working,\n\n340\n00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.700\nwhich it should now, okay,\nand it's not working.\n\n341\n00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.800\nYou could manually create an auto-discover\nrecord inside of your DNS server.\n\n342\n00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.384\nAgain, it's still gonna\ntake 24 to 48 hours.\n\n343\n00:20:13.384 --> 00:20:17.713\nBut if you've actually added in those DNS\ntrackers like I showed you to your DNS\n\n344\n00:20:17.713 --> 00:20:21.210\nregister, it should be fine and\nready to go, okay?\n\n345\n00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.344\nUnless that's done,\n\n346\n00:20:22.344 --> 00:20:26.591\nthe other part of the completion process\nthat should take months, at times, here.\n\n347\n00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:28.517\nDepending on how you do this,\n\n348\n00:20:28.517 --> 00:20:32.240\nis the decommissioning of\nyour on premises DNS servers.\n\n349\n00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.751\nThat's a very valuable part of this,\n\n350\n00:20:34.751 --> 00:20:39.231\nif you're going completely 100%\nto Exchange Online, right?\n\n351\n00:20:39.231 --> 00:20:42.474\nIf you leave it as a process\nthat's not decommissioned, and\n\n352\n00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:44.328\nthose servers are still running?\n\n353\n00:20:44.328 --> 00:20:48.330\nWell, you've gotta actually figure out\nwhy, and why that data is still out there.\n\n354\n00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.830\nSo the whole process here, then,\n\n355\n00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.920\nis to go through a decommissioning\nprocess of those.\n\n356\n00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.270\nIf you've been saying,\nare we gonna get into that?\n\n357\n00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.310\nNo, but if you wanna learn more about it,\n\n358\n00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.175\nmake sure you check out the 70-345 show,\nwith Bryan Switerbaun and myself.\n\n359\n00:21:01.175 --> 00:21:04.560\nAnd we do actually take you through\nthat idea of decommissioning, and\n\n360\n00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.440\nshow you how that ends up happening.\n\n361\n00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.350\nAnd that’s going to be an important\npart of what you have to learn, as well.\n\n362\n00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:12.650\nSo, the PowerShell itself,\nit is a little bit scary,\n\n363\n00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.790\nbecause it’s like five different commands.\n\n364\n00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.510\nAnd you just kind of got to wait and\nverify, and wait and verify, and\n\n365\n00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.070\nmake sure that everything’s running.\n\n366\n00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.120\nBut once that's done, you now have\nprobably successfully migrated at least\n\n367\n00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.720\nover, your first batch,\nthat you thought was successful.\n\n368\n00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.400\nYou want allow them test that,\nthat's what you want to do.\n\n369\n00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.010\nThen you can create your other ones,\nand continue from that process there.\n\n370\n00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.830\nMost of us though, in reality,\nwe're going to use the GUI.\n\n371\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.050\nRegardless of how disjointed it looks,\nwe're going to do that.\n\n372\n00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:44.380\nBut if you want to be able to know the\nPowerShell, this is what it's going to be.\n\n373\n00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.700\nIt's something that you'll probably have\nto make sure that you do prepare for\n\n374\n00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.120\non the exam, anyways.\n\n375\n00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.530\nSo make sure you do take a look at the\ncommands that we've actually issued, too.\n\n376\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.350\nSo that should wrap up,\n\n377\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.600\nat least an example of a migration\nstrategy that we can use.\n\n378\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.370\nTo go from an on-premises Exchange Server\ninto the Exchange Online.\n\n379\n00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.958\n&gt;&gt; Hey Ronnie, what is the Import\nservice in Office 365, and\n\n380\n00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.477\nwhy we choose to use that?\n\n381\n00:22:07.477 --> 00:22:09.635\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's kinda strange.\n\n382\n00:22:09.635 --> 00:22:14.526\nWhe migration strategies that we have\nright now, they really do help us out.\n\n383\n00:22:14.526 --> 00:22:18.770\nAs long as everybody is kind\nof a regular email user.\n\n384\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.431\nAnd the stuff that we have available,\n\n385\n00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:26.349\nit will migrate over in terms of days,\nmaybe even weeks if necessary.\n\n386\n00:22:26.349 --> 00:22:28.370\nDepending on how many users that we have.\n\n387\n00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:32.740\nBut the problem with it, though,\nis when we have terabytes and\n\n388\n00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.580\nterabytes of mailboxes, okay?\n\n389\n00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.990\nA tremendous amount of data,\nthat is when we start having issues.\n\n390\n00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:46.060\nOnce that starts to happen,\nthen that means that somebody's email box.\n\n391\n00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.860\nLet's take, for example, somebody's\nemail box turns out to be 100 gigs.\n\n392\n00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.720\nWhich would be insane,\nbut let's say it is.\n\n393\n00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.650\nWell, that means in that batch of 150,\n\n394\n00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.300\nif that one is number 100,\nno, let's not even do that.\n\n395\n00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:02.400\nLet's say it's number 35, okay,\nthat it's actually migrating over.\n\n396\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.970\nThat can sit there for a ton of a long\ntime, before it gets to the next 10.\n\n397\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.210\nWhich might be 10 megabytes a piece, okay?\n\n398\n00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.390\nSo it might sit there for half a day,\nor let's say it's 500 gigs.\n\n399\n00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.420\nIt might sit there for\n2 days, for all we know.\n\n400\n00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.950\nAnd just trying to get through\nthat mailbox, and that migration,\n\n401\n00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.920\nof all that stuff into Exchange Online.\n\n402\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.320\nThat's when it becomes hard to actually\ndeal with, in terms of what we need.\n\n403\n00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.230\nSo there is another possibility,\nin terms of a strategy that can be used.\n\n404\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.780\nThat's called the idea here\nof that Import service.\n\n405\n00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.175\nSo let's show you what\nthat process is like here.\n\n406\n00:23:39.175 --> 00:23:43.976\nLet me get it back into\nthe Office admin center, and\n\n407\n00:23:43.976 --> 00:23:48.787\nthen back into Exchange here,\nis what I want to do.\n\n408\n00:23:48.787 --> 00:23:50.997\nOops, well let me see if I\ncan get back into Exchange.\n\n409\n00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:03.526\nAnd once we're actually\nback into Exchange,\n\n410\n00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:07.751\na lot of times the way that we\nwould normally move somebody over.\n\n411\n00:24:07.751 --> 00:24:10.740\nIf those strategies are not\nworking out effectively.\n\n412\n00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.808\nAs we can get every user if we want to,\nor we can do it through the mailboxes to\n\n413\n00:24:14.808 --> 00:24:18.309\ncreate what we call a PST,\na Personal Storage Type file, okay?\n\n414\n00:24:18.309 --> 00:24:21.860\nAnd that will essentially combine\neverything into one file for\n\n415\n00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.320\ntheir mailbox and\nallow us to be able to do this.\n\n416\n00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.500\nNow, once we do that, we're gonna be able\nto just copy over to the email data, and\n\n417\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.340\nif it's terabytes of\ninformation will copy that\n\n418\n00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.590\nto online storage that's\navailable to us to do so.\n\n419\n00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.030\nSo it's from here that\nyou do have this chance\n\n420\n00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.570\nto actually import\nthe information in there.\n\n421\n00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:48.302\nNow on this one, let me make sure I\nremember where that is going to be.\n\n422\n00:24:48.302 --> 00:24:52.530\nLet me select Mailboxes and Migration.\n\n423\n00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:53.790\nActually it's not Migration here.\n\n424\n00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.550\nIt's going to be, where did I put that?\n\n425\n00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.200\nHere.\n\n426\n00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.010\nSee, I was actually in the wrong place.\n\n427\n00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.130\nSo let me go back to\nthe Admin Center itself.\n\n428\n00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.480\nI was like why is that not familiar?\n\n429\n00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.261\nThat's because, let me close this out.\n\n430\n00:25:08.261 --> 00:25:11.526\nLet me get back into the Admin Center\ninstead of domains here.\n\n431\n00:25:14.427 --> 00:25:16.200\nTry to get back here.\n\n432\n00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.495\nNow it's right here under Users.\n\n433\n00:25:18.495 --> 00:25:20.290\nMan, that went completely different.\n\n434\n00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.810\nI was like, now we're in Exchange.\n\n435\n00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.670\nNo we're not, okay?\n\n436\n00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:30.420\nOnce I get into the users here,\nI can now look for Data Migration.\n\n437\n00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:35.070\nAnd that is gonna be actually underneath\nthe icon over here on the left-hand side.\n\n438\n00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.880\nUsers and data migration.\n\n439\n00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.130\nAnd this is where it brings us\ninto the different types of\n\n440\n00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:43.910\nservices that are available.\n\n441\n00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.740\nNotice that we can select the appropriate\nsource that we're planning to migrate and\n\n442\n00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.250\nthen it will guide us\nthrough the experience.\n\n443\n00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.940\nSo depending on what you\nalready have stored.\n\n444\n00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.920\nSo let's say you have Gmail accounts.\n\n445\n00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.020\nNotice that you have this ability to\nsimply say here's what you need to migrate\n\n446\n00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.550\nall the data over.\n\n447\n00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:04.620\nSo Hotmail, Outlook, Exchange,\nother sources here, OneDrive upload,\n\n448\n00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.420\nPSTs, Onboarding guidance.\n\n449\n00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.840\nYou also have of course actual\nguidance that can help you out there.\n\n450\n00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.185\nAnd that can help you out\nto do what you want to.\n\n451\n00:26:13.185 --> 00:26:16.473\nBut it's right here where\nyou select upload PST file.\n\n452\n00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:20.982\nAnd let's see if it actually\nbrings us to where we want to go.\n\n453\n00:26:23.698 --> 00:26:24.940\n&gt;&gt; Ding, ding, ding.\n\n454\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just a little bit\nof a waiting game at times,\n\n455\n00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.430\nespecially late in the afternoon here.\n\n456\n00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.085\nAnd this is what we'll end up seeing.\n\n457\n00:26:31.085 --> 00:26:34.633\nSo it's right here that\nif we choose to do this,\n\n458\n00:26:34.633 --> 00:26:39.260\nit will help us to upload\na ton of data all at one time.\n\n459\n00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.640\nSo if I'm going to select the little\ndrop down on the plus sign.\n\n460\n00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.830\nAnd notice that these three options that\nwe have, okay, shield data to Microsoft.\n\n461\n00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:55.800\nIf all of my, let's say it's let's just\nkind of give a wild stupid number here.\n\n462\n00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.050\nLet's say I have 10\nterabytes of PST files.\n\n463\n00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.890\nThat'd be insane ,but it can happen, okay?\n\n464\n00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.280\nIf I had them all stored on the hard\ndrive I can ship these to Microsoft.\n\n465\n00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.090\nAnd Microsoft will go ahead and\nupload them for me.\n\n466\n00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.350\nSounds like a solution, you'll half\nto pay for it, but it is a solution.\n\n467\n00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.190\nIt's a plan that we can do.\n\n468\n00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.720\nThe other thing that we can do though,\nis just simply upload them ourselves.\n\n469\n00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:22.230\nIf I select upload email messages,\nit is in here,\n\n470\n00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:26.990\nit will now create a nice little wizard,\nthere we go, okay.\n\n471\n00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.950\nIt will actually give us a nice little\nwizard to actually create through.\n\n472\n00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:36.410\nAnd it's here that we can begin this\nidea of uploading over a network.\n\n473\n00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:40.660\nNow if you do have a ton of data and\nyou don't have bandwidth, right?\n\n474\n00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.960\nSo in other words if your Internet\nconnection is relatively anemic at this\n\n475\n00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:51.185\npoint, then uploading terabytes of\ndata at one time is painful, okay?\n\n476\n00:27:51.185 --> 00:27:55.451\nSo it might actually be worthwhile for\nyou to consider taking those hard drives,\n\n477\n00:27:55.451 --> 00:27:59.985\nsending them off to Microsoft, and then\ngetting them back once you're done, okay?\n\n478\n00:27:59.985 --> 00:28:01.610\nSo, that might actually be the way to go.\n\n479\n00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.910\nBut if you don't have a ton, but\n\n480\n00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.150\nyou have a bit of data,\nyou can instead walk through this.\n\n481\n00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.620\nSo here's a companion for uploading it.\n\n482\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:17.440\nWhat we are gonna get is this, well this,\nwhich is an SAS URL for networking upload.\n\n483\n00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.290\nAnd also this is actually gonna be\na little bit more unusual here, okay?\n\n484\n00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.836\nNow the reason why is because\non this one I'm gonna click\n\n485\n00:28:26.836 --> 00:28:30.038\non this link in a moment, here, okay?\n\n486\n00:28:30.038 --> 00:28:33.760\nI'm not gonna do it while\nwe're kind of showing it.\n\n487\n00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.420\nBecause this link is actually\na valuable link, is what we have.\n\n488\n00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.620\nSo what I'm gonna do is kinda\nshow you a portion of it,\n\n489\n00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.160\nis what we're going to do here.\n\n490\n00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:46.010\nBut if you click on this link, it's gonna\ngenerate a fairly unique link that then\n\n491\n00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:51.290\nyou can use along with what we call\nthis AzCopy tool, which is a command\n\n492\n00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:57.150\nline utility to begin that download\nprocess or the upload process.\n\n493\n00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:00.807\nNow we're not showing everything,\nbut we want to at least show you\n\n494\n00:29:00.807 --> 00:29:04.481\nthat you do need to make sure that\nyou get this SAS link here, okay?\n\n495\n00:29:04.481 --> 00:29:08.299\nWe do need to make sure that\nyou get this AzCopy tool, and\n\n496\n00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:13.200\nthat you run the tool from\nthe directory that it installs into.\n\n497\n00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.540\nSo it's gonna download an msi onto your\ncomputer, you're gonna run it, and\n\n498\n00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.190\nthen you're gonna go and\nlook for that particular tool.\n\n499\n00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:25.130\nAnd once you're done,\nyou will then create a command.\n\n500\n00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:29.570\nNow we'll say here's the source,\nhere's where my PST files are.\n\n501\n00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:33.210\nAnd then you're going to say\nthe destination of where that's going.\n\n502\n00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.510\nAnd then you're going to paste\nin this link that you copy.\n\n503\n00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.560\nFrom that point it will go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n504\n00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.550\nIt will literally copy it\nup to the Azure cloud.\n\n505\n00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.420\nAnd you will be up and ready to go, okay?\n\n506\n00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:50.430\nSo I'm really not showing it to you\nbecause it's really something that is\n\n507\n00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.600\nvaluable and\nsomebody could take advantage of.\n\n508\n00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.810\nAnd that's why we're being\nvery careful about this.\n\n509\n00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.277\nSo at this point,\nonce you're done with that,\n\n510\n00:29:59.277 --> 00:30:02.667\nlet me show you the next\nprocess here instead.\n\n511\n00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.550\nSo it is from this point, let me make\nsure I'm getting to the right place.\n\n512\n00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:15.370\nThere we go, I need to go into\nthe folder and into this folder.\n\n513\n00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.870\nI've actually created two PST\nfiles that are available to us.\n\n514\n00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.830\nOne of them's not,\nactually both of them aren't big at all.\n\n515\n00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.883\nBut ones we have that,\n\n516\n00:30:26.883 --> 00:30:32.670\nthis is where I can now\nfind that particular\n\n517\n00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:37.950\nlocation where that AzCopy tool is.\n\n518\n00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:45.890\nIt's gonna be under Program Files, under\nMicrosoft SDK, Azure and there it is.\n\n519\n00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.436\nNotice the AzCopy.\n\n520\n00:30:47.436 --> 00:30:49.390\nAll right, so here's where it's located.\n\n521\n00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.670\nI need to run this utility\nfrom the command line.\n\n522\n00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.785\nSo I'm simply going to type in cmd.\n\n523\n00:30:55.785 --> 00:30:58.160\nI'm gonna make sure I run\nit as the administrator.\n\n524\n00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:06.340\nFrom here I need to navigate back\nto that particular location,\n\n525\n00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:13.486\nwhich should be C:/ Program Files\nx86/Microsoft SDK/Azure,\n\n526\n00:31:13.486 --> 00:31:17.440\nand then inside of here, let's see.\n\n527\n00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:25.970\nI should have the AzCopy.\n\n528\n00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.190\nOkay, now on this particular command.\n\n529\n00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.890\nLet me just navigate here\nfirst before I do anything.\n\n530\n00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:35.228\nThat we'll get me out of trouble here.\n\n531\n00:31:35.228 --> 00:31:41.101\nAnd it's here that we\nwould run the AzCopy,\n\n532\n00:31:41.101 --> 00:31:46.511\nthen we would do something like source.\n\n533\n00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:49.293\nAnd then our destination Okay,\n\n534\n00:31:49.293 --> 00:31:55.640\nnow I'll have this inside of\nthe actual notes, the show notes here.\n\n535\n00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.570\nBut that's what you're gonna do.\n\n536\n00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:01.360\nYour source is gonna be wherever those\nparticular PST files are located.\n\n537\n00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.750\nThe destination will be that\nSAS URL that you'll copy in here.\n\n538\n00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:09.260\nAnd once you're done with that,\nit should run.\n\n539\n00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.270\nAnd then it will copy up into the cloud\n\n540\n00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.370\nto make sure that everything\nends up getting up there.\n\n541\n00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:20.200\nAnd from that point,\nonce you have it stored up there,\n\n542\n00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:25.556\nthat is now when you can go into\nthe Azure Active Directory and\n\n543\n00:32:25.556 --> 00:32:30.282\nnow migrate each one of those\nPSTs into the individual\n\n544\n00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:33.555\nuser accounts for their mail boxes.\n\n545\n00:32:33.555 --> 00:32:35.140\nNow, if you're going,\nare you showing us that?\n\n546\n00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.910\nNo, we're definitely not, because\nthat's a bit beyond what we wanna do.\n\n547\n00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:43.200\nThe key here is to make sure we\nunderstand the tools that are available.\n\n548\n00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.960\nYou know where the data migration is, you\ndefinitely need to know that you need that\n\n549\n00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.850\nURL as well and\nyou need this AZ copy tool and\n\n550\n00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:56.170\nneed to be able to run that\nfrom the command line.\n\n551\n00:32:56.170 --> 00:33:00.240\nBut that SAS, not showing it, because it\nis kind of a valuable link that you don't\n\n552\n00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.500\nwanna show everybody on the planet,\nwhere that link actually goes here, okay?\n\n553\n00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.960\nSo once that's done,\nit will copy everything up.\n\n554\n00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.720\nAnd you'll end up getting all of your data\nstored up there for you to be ready now.\n\n555\n00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:17.050\nAnd then import those PSTs into your\nExchange users, and you can do that.\n\n556\n00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.270\nAnd so, there's others out\nthere that you can check out.\n\n557\n00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:24.540\nSo do check out that 70-345 class for\nthat one, as well.\n\n558\n00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.440\nAnd you'll see kind of the end\nresult of using this copy tool and\n\n559\n00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.560\neverything that it needs.\n\n560\n00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.360\nBut overall though, that will allow\nyou to at least see part of what\n\n561\n00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.470\nyou're talking about when you start using\nthat import service that's available.\n\n562\n00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:42.610\nA really powerful tool when you have a\ntremendous amount of data that needs to be\n\n563\n00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:46.562\nimported in, especially on when\nthe migration strategies may seem to fall\n\n564\n00:33:46.562 --> 00:33:48.965\na little bit short of\nwhat you need them to do.\n\n565\n00:33:48.965 --> 00:33:53.180\nThis is kinda the way to get around it\nwhen you have really a lot of data.\n\n566\n00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n567\n00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.461\nAnd thank you for joining us for\nenabling Office 365 services,\n\n568\n00:33:59.461 --> 00:34:02.972\nin this case mailbox\nmigration strategy part two.\n\n569\n00:34:02.972 --> 00:34:05.150\nAnd you'll wanna catch\npart one if you have not.\n\n570\n00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:06.910\nYou'll enjoy it and\nyou'll learn a lot from it.\n\n571\n00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:12.050\nI am your host, Zach Memos for\nITProTV, thank you for watching.\n\n572\n00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.909\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n573\n00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:16.348\n&gt;&gt; And we wills see you next time.\n\n574\n00:34:16.348 -->

00:00:08.271\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:11.545\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:16.400\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.940\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nenabling Office 365 services.\n\n7\n00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.900\nAnd today, we're going to plan for\n\n8\n00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.940\nExchange Online with\nour IT pro Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.920\nHey, Ronnie!\n\n10\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.760\n&gt;&gt; How are you doing, Zach?\n\n11\n00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.790\n&gt;&gt; I am great!\n\n12\n00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.910\nFeeling red today.\n\n13\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, great!\n\n14\n00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.870\nYou are actually wearing a very\nnice red shirt, there, so\n\n15\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.840\nwe're glad that you're\nat least feeling red.\n\n16\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.575\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:36.196\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n18\n00:00:36.196 --> 00:00:40.030\nIt also means that it's time to jump into\nour episode here where we're gonna be\n\n19\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.750\ntalking about planning for\nExchange Online.\n\n20\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.170\nNow this is a little bit unusual in terms\nof the order of things that we've been\n\n21\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.768\ndoing, Zach.\n\n22\n00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:49.870\nWe've actually already\nconfigured Exchange Online.\n\n23\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.330\nI know you're pausing, why the heck would\nhe configure it before he planned it?\n\n24\n00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.785\nWell I didn't plan it like that.\n\n25\n00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:59.340\nIt's just the order in which\nthe exam objectives were covered.\n\n26\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.780\nAnd instead of me trying\nto be super logical,\n\n27\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.183\nI said, let's just cover them\nin the order that they came out.\n\n28\n00:01:05.183 --> 00:01:05.800\n&gt;&gt; Better be safe than sorry.\n\n29\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.630\n&gt;&gt; And it was just me not thinking\nabout it and here it goes.\n\n30\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.440\nBut we are gonna talk about\nthe planning stages and\n\n31\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.271\nwhat we actually need to do and\nthen some considerations.\n\n32\n00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:19.090\nWe all, of course,\none to actually think about as we say,\n\n33\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.550\nall right we're moving into\nthe Exchange Online environment.\n\n34\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.630\nAnd so here's a few things that we\nwanna make sure that we do cover and\n\n35\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.750\nthat we understand as we go into that.\n\n36\n00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.740\nSo one of the first topics that we\nwant to just talk about briefly here\n\n37\n00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.040\nis gonna be planning for\n\n38\n00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.420\nthe idea of how do we want users to\nbe able to archive their information.\n\n39\n00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.500\nAnd when it comes down to that,\n\n40\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.690\nit's not that we don't want\nusers to archive information.\n\n41\n00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.960\nHeck, that's almost a given,\n\n42\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.880\nthat we want all of our users to be\nable to archive the information.\n\n43\n00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.700\nNone of us wants to sort of go,\nemails aren't important, and\n\n44\n00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.050\nthen three weeks later, somebody says,\ndid you get an email like a month or\n\n45\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.070\ntwo ago and it was about this?\n\n46\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.090\nAnd the user says, probably, but since\nwe're not archiving anymore, it's gone.\n\n47\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.110\n&gt;&gt; So archiving is one thing,\n\n48\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.270\nwhat do we need to consider when\nwe're planning for archive?\n\n49\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.350\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we have to get to,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.310\nSo that idea of consideration\nis not that we need to archive,\n\n51\n00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.810\nis that what we need to plan for.\n\n52\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.970\nAnd when it comes down to that,\nthe planning part of it really needs for\n\n53\n00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.890\nus to think about\nthe ideas of retention and\n\n54\n00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.940\nhow we get that retention to work as well\nas the duration and the periods like that.\n\n55\n00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.980\nNow, when we start to talk about that,\n\n56\n00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.050\nit's actually fairly a little\nbit more complex, right?\n\n57\n00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.690\nThe configuration side, when you do go in,\n\n58\n00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.950\nyou take a look at those\nconfiguring Exchange Online shows.\n\n59\n00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.960\nWe show you exactly how\nto create retention tags.\n\n60\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.300\nWe show you how to go in there and\ntalk about retention policies and\n\n61\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.180\nhow to get all that stuff set up.\n\n62\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.750\nSo you do want that to happen.\n\n63\n00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.060\nBut one of the key things here is\nthe duration of that retention.\n\n64\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.240\nAnd also what is the action\nwe wanted to take for\n\n65\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.130\nthat particular period of\nretention once it's over.\n\n66\n00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.320\nSo everything that we create,\nsuch as a policy or\n\n67\n00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.410\na tag, it usually has those\nelements involved in it.\n\n68\n00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.700\nA particular duration, as well as the idea\nhere of taking a look at the tags too.\n\n69\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.120\nAnd the policy that there also has to\nbe an action associated with that.\n\n70\n00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.145\n&gt;&gt; And that's something we're doing in\nthe web UI and also PowerShell, right?\n\n71\n00:03:21.145 --> 00:03:24.160\n&gt;&gt; Yup, and we did show you\nthat inside of that episode.\n\n72\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.380\nNow let's just show you\na brief reminder here,\n\n73\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.910\nat least in the web UI,\nwhere you go to set that\n\n74\n00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.920\nbecause we are gonna get into that more\nin depth since this is a planning show.\n\n75\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.540\nThis would had been great if it\nwill actually appear before that.\n\n76\n00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.230\nBut lets go and show you anyways.\n\n77\n00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.317\nSo here it is, I'm logged in as\nthe global administrator for my Exchange,\n\n78\n00:03:43.317 --> 00:03:47.500\nOffice 365 If I click on the Admin tile,\n\n79\n00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.200\nthat of course will bring me into\nthe Office 365 Admin center.\n\n80\n00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.130\nAt least in a moment it will.\n\n81\n00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.330\nLooks like it's a little\nbit sluggish today.\n\n82\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.640\nIf I scroll down on the navigation\nover here on the left hand side I\n\n83\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.280\nfind the Admin icon.\n\n84\n00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.843\nThen I can click on Exchange.\n\n85\n00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:14.360\nAnd once I'm actually inside of Exchange,\nif it does come up here.\n\n86\n00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.440\nAnd again, it's a little bit slow.\n\n87\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.570\nWe'll be able to see where we can create\nthe idea of these retention policies as\n\n88\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.460\nwell as the tags coming in.\n\n89\n00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.570\nSo, it's a place that we really have to\nget familiar with as we start to do this.\n\n90\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.680\nAnd we also need to talk about where\ndoes that stuff come from too.\n\n91\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.490\nSo, when it comes down to the planning\nof these different things,\n\n92\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.160\nlet me let it kind of fill in all it needs\nto while we talk about some of the details\n\n93\n00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.460\non this idea of retention here,\nis that we also need to talk about\n\n94\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.870\nwho comes up with this and\nwhere does it actually happen.\n\n95\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.230\nA lot of times,\nyou as the actual administrator,\n\n96\n00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.140\nyou don't get to make decisions on how\nlong you're going to retain e-mails.\n\n97\n00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.102\nSomebody else is gonna make that decision.\n\n98\n00:04:55.102 --> 00:04:58.667\nYou're the one that's gonna have to\nimplement a policy that will enforce that\n\n99\n00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:00.180\ndecision for you.\n\n100\n00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.340\nSo in reality, in terms of businesses it\ndepends on the industry that you're in,\n\n101\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.630\nit depends on your\norganization's own policies.\n\n102\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.180\nBut what you want here in\nterms of the archiving policy\n\n103\n00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.840\nis to make sure that you have it match up\nto whatever your security policies are.\n\n104\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.700\nIn terms of security, you wanna make\nsure that you have that ability to say,\n\n105\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.750\nwe have data up to this point in time, and\n\n106\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.270\nwhat is gonna be retained and\nwhat isn't gonna be retained.\n\n107\n00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.110\nAnd that is gonna be very important\nespecially when it comes out to\n\n108\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.330\nother matters that you have\nto consider for Exchange.\n\n109\n00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.468\nThe very fact is,\ntoday as such a litigious society, Zach,\n\n110\n00:05:36.468 --> 00:05:39.875\nthat people will say,\nI don't care if it goes back ten years.\n\n111\n00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:42.055\nI want that email.\n\n112\n00:05:42.055 --> 00:05:45.995\nNow, somebody comes back into your company\nand says, what do you mean I have it for\n\n113\n00:05:45.995 --> 00:05:47.365\nthe last eight years?\n\n114\n00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:49.655\nSo, you do have to plan for\nthings like this.\n\n115\n00:05:49.655 --> 00:05:53.355\nIt's not just an automatic,\nwe'll just hold it for six months.\n\n116\n00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:55.895\nYou've gotta be able to talk about that,\nand that's actually kind of key too.\n\n117\n00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:57.985\n&gt;&gt; Document, document,\ndocument, absolutely.\n\n118\n00:05:57.985 --> 00:06:00.275\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is,\nit's really about documentation, but\n\n119\n00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:03.655\nit's also about making sure that\nwhat our policies we set up here for\n\n120\n00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:08.460\nthe archiving lines up to what ever\nyour company's security policy is.\n\n121\n00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.260\nIf you have those things different,\n\n122\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.740\nyou're gonna end up finding yourself\nin an unusual situation especially if\n\n123\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.750\nsomething illegal arises that is not\ngonna be what you expect it to be.\n\n124\n00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.035\nYour security policy will say you're\nsupposed to retain it up to five years.\n\n125\n00:06:23.035 --> 00:06:25.225\nYou're gonna say I only have data for\nup to three years,\n\n126\n00:06:25.225 --> 00:06:29.600\ncuz that's the way I set the policy, and\nnow that's when you start having issues.\n\n127\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.350\nSo the best practice, right,\nget together with your security team and\n\n128\n00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.795\nyour security policies.\n\n129\n00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:38.360\nMake sure Legal understands\nwhat's going on here.\n\n130\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.099\nAnd they tell you what the policy\nshould be set out as we start to do it.\n\n131\n00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:42.920\n&gt;&gt; A nice tabletop.\n\n132\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, so let's take a look\nhere and when we start to see as.\n\n133\n00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.150\nNow here on the screen, here we are we\nare on the Exchange admin center and\n\n134\n00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.630\nI'm gonna scroll in just a little bit.\n\n135\n00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.450\nThe great thing is when we start\ntalking about things like retention,\n\n136\n00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.350\nthat really does come underneath\ncompliance management right over here.\n\n137\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.560\nAnd you also see it in this\nbig category list as well.\n\n138\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.002\nSo if I click on compliance management,\nnow across the top of the screen you'll\n\n139\n00:07:08.002 --> 00:07:10.522\nsee that you have these\nretentive policies,\n\n140\n00:07:10.522 --> 00:07:12.658\nas well as the retention tags, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:12.658 --> 00:07:16.279\nNow, we're gonna ignore this kind\nof big yellow thing for right now.\n\n142\n00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.424\nBut let me make sure\nthat we go in here and\n\n143\n00:07:18.424 --> 00:07:22.228\nyou'll start seeing a couple\nof different things too, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:22.228 --> 00:07:27.790\nSo retention policies are essentially what\nwe set on our Exchange Server to say,\n\n145\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.090\nhere's how long we\nare gonna retain things.\n\n146\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.410\nRemember that there is a default\npolicy called the Default.\n\n147\n00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.235\nDefault, I'm not gonna\nbe able to say that.\n\n148\n00:07:36.235 --> 00:07:40.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Default MRM, okay, which is the idea of\n\n149\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.760\nthe Messaging Retention Management or\nMessage Retention Management.\n\n150\n00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.990\nSo, strange name,\nyou don't tend to see that.\n\n151\n00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.830\nBut as you start digging in documentation,\nyou'll see it out a little bit more.\n\n152\n00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.685\nBut that's where you actually\nset up the policies.\n\n153\n00:07:53.685 --> 00:07:58.322\nRetention tags essentially give us\nthe ability to set the conditions of that\n\n154\n00:07:58.322 --> 00:07:58.906\npolicy.\n\n155\n00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:03.767\nAnd remember right here,\nthe key things that I talk about, right?\n\n156\n00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:08.880\nRetention period, retention action,\nthis all falls in line with the planning.\n\n157\n00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.680\nThere is always that retention time and\nan action that's associated with it.\n\n158\n00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.860\nThen from that point, we apply them.\n\n159\n00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.430\nNow, let me mention this yellow bar\nbecause this is actually going to become\n\n160\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.630\nvery important when we start to see this.\n\n161\n00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.040\nLet me click back here to make sure\nthat we're actually seeing, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.040\nNow there is a lot of different\nthings that have been changing over\n\n163\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.510\ntime with Office 365.\n\n164\n00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.940\nAnd even though you can come in here and\nset this up, and it's a great thing for\n\n165\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.830\nyou to do, you'd also have to go into,\n\n166\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.935\nwell, things like the [INAUDIBLE]\nSharePoint into their admin center.\n\n167\n00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:44.286\nOneDrive into theirs.\n\n168\n00:08:44.286 --> 00:08:48.901\nExchange, Office 365 groups, public\nfolders, Skype for Business, that if you\n\n169\n00:08:48.901 --> 00:08:53.770\nhave these retention policies, you have\nto configure them all right there.\n\n170\n00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:59.160\nNow what you're actually starting to see\nthough is notice what it actually says.\n\n171\n00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.169\nNow, I've done this not\nonly in this episode, but\n\n172\n00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:02.446\nalso in the previous episodes.\n\n173\n00:09:02.446 --> 00:09:04.805\nI said let's not pay attention\nto that right now, but\n\n174\n00:09:04.805 --> 00:09:06.900\nwe're gonna pay attention to it now.\n\n175\n00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.360\nYou can create a single retention\npolicy in the Office 365\n\n176\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.770\nCompliance Center to protect all\nthe contents is what you can do.\n\n177\n00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.120\nSo instead of individually having to\npopulate and manage that, they're saying,\n\n178\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.380\nif you go to the Office Compliance Center,\nthat's where you can actually do\n\n179\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.020\nit a little bit more, and actually go\nbeyond just the scope of Exchange here.\n\n180\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.035\nYou actually can take\na little bit more time, and\n\n181\n00:09:30.035 --> 00:09:36.020\ncreate a retention policy that applies\nacross multiple products, as well.\n\n182\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.690\nAnd that's a good thing for us.\n\n183\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.310\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nlet's talk about administrative sites.\n\n184\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.150\nAnd so there's so many of them.\n\n185\n00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.100\nDo we have to configure in each one?\n\n186\n00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.320\nDo we have to address each one and\nvisit each one to ensure compliance?\n\n187\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.500\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of times where you'll\nactually see that this answer is kind of\n\n188\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.590\nwhat that yellow bar was about, right?\n\n189\n00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.950\nThe very fact is that the very\nbeginnings or kind of the beginning and\n\n190\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.570\ngrowing up parts for\nOffice 365 in the early stages.\n\n191\n00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.600\nAnd then as they started realizing\nwhat businesses need it was.\n\n192\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.990\nIt was a lot of confusion.\n\n193\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.780\nIf I set it up here,\ndid it also apply here?\n\n194\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.750\nIf it didn't I now have to go over\nhere and then you realize it's\n\n195\n00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.120\nalmost completely foreign and\ndifferent than what you have it set it up.\n\n196\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.680\nSo in Office 365 they\nstarted changing that around\n\n197\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.020\nto the point where they said what\nwe need is really a single portal\n\n198\n00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.450\nthat can help us to manage\na lot of compliance issues.\n\n199\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:35.240\nBut this is where Cloud Services and\nstuff gets a little bit confusing, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.708\nThere's some things which you only\nwant scoped to one particular product.\n\n201\n00:10:39.708 --> 00:10:42.780\nIn other words you want to make\nsure that it actually follows this.\n\n202\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.219\nAnd you want that to happen because\nits only particular to that product.\n\n203\n00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:48.789\nBut then there are others which\nof course would be for them and\n\n204\n00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:53.199\nthose your still have to kind of go,\nall right yes if you want something that\n\n205\n00:10:53.199 --> 00:10:58.610\nreally only applies to this you've gotta\ngo into that admin center and do that.\n\n206\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.390\nBut there are some generics,\nsome very generalized or\n\n207\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.620\nglobal things that we can\ndo to help set up security.\n\n208\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.000\nAnd instead of having to go\ninto every single product and\n\n209\n00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.600\ngo, no I forgot this and\nx product whatever it is in Office 365.\n\n210\n00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.390\nAnd then realize, I've gotten on every\nother one but this one and then go,\n\n211\n00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.320\nokay did I put that set, what did I do?\n\n212\n00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.350\nDon't do that.\n\n213\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.920\nOffice 365 really since make\nsure I'm telling you right here,\n\n214\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.120\nas of December of-\n&gt;&gt; 2015.\n\n215\n00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.540\n&gt;&gt; 2015, yes, they changed this up so\n\n216\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.090\nlet me show you what they\nactually ended up changing here.\n\n217\n00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.570\nSo I'm back on\nthe administrative screen and\n\n218\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.740\nI get back into the Office\n365 Admin Center.\n\n219\n00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.650\nI'm gonna go to the Admin tile again.\n\n220\n00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.300\nSo it's kind of expanding\nout here just for a moment.\n\n221\n00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.420\nUsually that doesn't happen too often.\n\n222\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.840\nBut notice that there is a link here for\nSecurity &amp; Compliance.\n\n223\n00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:58.480\nNow this idea of security and compliance,\nbefore December of 2015, it was\n\n224\n00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:05.998\nessentially called the Office 365\nCompliance Protections Center itself.\n\n225\n00:12:05.998 --> 00:12:09.360\nNow, it did some of\nthe generic protection, but\n\n226\n00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.800\nreally wasn't for full compliance and\nfor everything else.\n\n227\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.124\nSo, now when they start talking about\nretention policies and keeping data and\n\n228\n00:12:17.124 --> 00:12:21.449\ndata loss prevention and stuff like that,\nthey combined everything together\n\n229\n00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:25.790\nunderneath this one banner here and\nessentially gave us this, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.580\nNow the great thing about this is even\nif you're brand new to managing and\n\n231\n00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.110\nto planning out stuff it is,\n\n232\n00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.020\nit's the one place that can really help\nyou to set up those global options\n\n233\n00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:41.200\nthat reach across all of Office 365 to\nhelp you set some of this stuff up.\n\n234\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.879\nSo this is where you do have things\nthat you have to kind of remember.\n\n235\n00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:49.780\nThat if it's a global setting,\nthey say, across Office 365,\n\n236\n00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.530\nyou need to setup retention,\nwhatever policies.\n\n237\n00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.530\nWell they're saying,\ndon't go into SharePoint for Admin Center.\n\n238\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.710\nDon't go into Exchange Admin Center.\n\n239\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.140\nThey're essentially saying, come to here,\nthe Security &amp; Compliance Center.\n\n240\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.100\nAnd take a look at those settings in here.\n\n241\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.830\nWe're not gonna go over\nevery single setting.\n\n242\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:14.290\nBut I do want to show you what's\navailable inside of the Security &amp;\n\n243\n00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.850\nCompliance Center so that you can see\nwhat you're actually managing here, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.995\nSo here, as we take a look into\nthe Security and Compliance,\n\n245\n00:13:21.995 --> 00:13:24.472\nnotice they have this\nnice little home screen.\n\n246\n00:13:24.472 --> 00:13:26.849\nAnd yours may appear\na little bit differently.\n\n247\n00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:30.629\nAnd the reason why is because,\nlet me see if I can collapse that down.\n\n248\n00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:34.666\nIs because I've set my resolution pretty\nlow so that we can see without you\n\n249\n00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:38.003\nhaving to squint at everything\nthat I'm trying to show you.\n\n250\n00:13:38.003 --> 00:13:40.655\nThere's the ability to\nmanage threat management.\n\n251\n00:13:40.655 --> 00:13:43.010\nThere's also data governance over here.\n\n252\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.838\nIf I scrolled a little bit more, there\nis even a search and ability to look for\n\n253\n00:13:47.838 --> 00:13:49.127\nparticular users.\n\n254\n00:13:49.127 --> 00:13:50.350\nSearch and investigation.\n\n255\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:55.990\nService assurance, you name it there's\na ton of these different things.\n\n256\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.779\nIf I expand out the navigation\nbar over on the lefthand side,\n\n257\n00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:03.050\nlet's talk about the idea of alerts, okay?\n\n258\n00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.410\nThroughout Office 365 is such a major\nproduct, you don't know when things\n\n259\n00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.120\nmight actually alert you to certain\ntypes of things that are going on.\n\n260\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.360\nBut here they give you\na centralized management center.\n\n261\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.760\nAnd the other thing that I also\nwant to point out is that sometimes\n\n262\n00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.610\nthey ask you about unusual\nthings on the exam.\n\n263\n00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.520\nAnd they do appear every once in awhile.\n\n264\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.269\nIf you need to get to\nthe Security &amp; Compliance Center,\n\n265\n00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:27.548\ntake a look at my URL up here at the top.\n\n266\n00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:35.500\nThe easiest way to get to this, right,\nis https://protection.office.com.\n\n267\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.680\nDon't worry about the rest of this, but\nthat normally will get you to this center.\n\n268\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.400\nNow if you're not logged in,\nyou have to login.\n\n269\n00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.900\nBut overall that should bring\nyou right here too, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.469\nSo here on the alerts it says, hey welcome\nto the new Security &amp; Compliance alerts.\n\n271\n00:14:50.469 --> 00:14:54.290\nHere's where you can find that all new\nalert features that are available.\n\n272\n00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.380\nThey can give you alert trends,\nalerts by severity and\n\n273\n00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.430\nwhat they have done, any recent alerts,\nany policy that you've set up.\n\n274\n00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.352\nSo might have it where you\nhave system that says,\n\n275\n00:15:04.352 --> 00:15:10.070\nlook on my storage if I get to 80% full,\nI want an alert sent out.\n\n276\n00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.650\nWe can actually see information like\nthat come through right here on\n\n277\n00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:14.938\nthe actual alerts.\n\n278\n00:15:14.938 --> 00:15:19.170\nYou of course can take a look at the views\nof alerts if you have any created.\n\n279\n00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.000\nI don't at this point.\n\n280\n00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.390\nAnd then of course even create\nyour own alert policies.\n\n281\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:31.342\nAnd here they have a few different\nones that have been set up by default.\n\n282\n00:15:31.342 --> 00:15:34.359\nLet me see if I can scroll down here.\n\n283\n00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:37.850\nOops I'm trying to scroll\nwithout clicking on anything.\n\n284\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.776\nWhat did I just do here and\nlet me just do here?\n\n285\n00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:42.878\nI'm probably not zoomed in.\n\n286\n00:15:42.878 --> 00:15:44.495\nAll right there we go.\n\n287\n00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:47.056\nSo here, you're actually starting\nto see that there's a few of them.\n\n288\n00:15:47.056 --> 00:15:49.718\nSo if I just click on\none that will help you.\n\n289\n00:15:49.718 --> 00:15:54.411\nElevation of exchange admin privileges.If\nyou do need something like this where\n\n290\n00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:55.975\nsomebody says alerts you,\n\n291\n00:15:55.975 --> 00:16:00.817\nwhen someone in your organization becomes\nexchange admin or gets new permissions.\n\n292\n00:16:00.817 --> 00:16:05.354\nSo this way you're not having to track\nevery single user It will track it for\n\n293\n00:16:05.354 --> 00:16:08.682\nyou if somebody does have\ntheir privileges elevated.\n\n294\n00:16:08.682 --> 00:16:11.950\nSame thing here with permissions, as well.\n\n295\n00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.530\nWhen we start talking about permissions.\n\n296\n00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.150\nWe instead can say, look,\n\n297\n00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.990\nsome of this compliance stuff,\nI don't want to manage on my own.\n\n298\n00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.950\nI want somebody else to be able to do it.\n\n299\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.330\nWe essentially can use this help\ndelegate those permissions.\n\n300\n00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:30.390\nIn here they already have some built-in\ntypes of permissions delegated.\n\n301\n00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:34.770\nFor example, we had setup also\neDiscovery in another episode.\n\n302\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.470\nWell if I want to chain that,\nif I click on eDiscovery Manager and\n\n303\n00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:43.390\nI click on the pencil,\nnotice it’s in here that I can\n\n304\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:48.480\nadd in who that Discovery Manager is\ngonna be, who’s the administrator.\n\n305\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.990\nI can actually add users in here and\nessentially delegate that responsibility,\n\n306\n00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.030\nor give them the permission to do stuff,\nin terms of compliance and\n\n307\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.600\nadministration too.\n\n308\n00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.770\nSo there's a lot of them.\n\n309\n00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:04.080\nNow, there are a couple of caveats\nin here I need to point out.\n\n310\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.130\nIf I scroll in, and\n\n311\n00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.600\nwe'll see how far we can get in here\nwithout it looking too distorted here.\n\n312\n00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.290\nSo it says assign permissions to\npeople in your organization so\n\n313\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.260\nthey can perform task here.\n\n314\n00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.520\nPretty much what it is.\n\n315\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.140\nBut notice that there is\na couple of them that are saying,\n\n316\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.550\nyou can't do right here, okay.\n\n317\n00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:23.547\nSo that's why I say there's a yes or\nno and sometimes they even point out, so\n\n318\n00:17:23.547 --> 00:17:26.983\nfor example, they show which is\na topic we're just talking about\n\n319\n00:17:26.983 --> 00:17:29.061\nto assign permissions for archiving.\n\n320\n00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:34.518\nAuditing and retention policies,\nthey tell you look, you can do this,\n\n321\n00:17:34.518 --> 00:17:40.171\nbut they'd rather you actually go into\nthe exchange admin center to do so.\n\n322\n00:17:40.171 --> 00:17:42.660\nSo even though we're getting\na warning system why don't you go and\n\n323\n00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.600\nset it up over there.\n\n324\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.090\nHere they're saying if you just\nreally need to do this or archiving,\n\n325\n00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.010\nauditing, and retention on exchange.\n\n326\n00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.800\nGoing to the Exchange Admin Center.\n\n327\n00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.960\nDon't do it for everybody unless you\nreally need to do this for everybody.\n\n328\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.900\nThe same thing here for\ndocument deletion policies.\n\n329\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.900\nNow, this goes to a place that you and\nI don't normally have access to,\n\n330\n00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.470\nwhere it says\nDocument Deletion Policy Center.\n\n331\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.790\nThat's not in any of our Exchange\nadmin centers at all, okay.\n\n332\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:15.070\nSo over on the left hand side when I click\non the little a and it pops up all this.\n\n333\n00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:21.720\nThere is no Document Deletion\nPolicy Center that I know of.\n\n334\n00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.610\nSo the way that I know how to get there\nis by simply clicking on this link.\n\n335\n00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.030\nWell, if I can.\n\n336\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.090\nSo let me click on the link\nagain there it goes.\n\n337\n00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.033\nWe'll come back to that in a moment but\n\n338\n00:18:32.033 --> 00:18:35.638\nyou actually see where it's asking me\nto sign in and now when I sign in.\n\n339\n00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:45.153\nIf I've typed it in correctly it will\nnow bring me into a share point site and\n\n340\n00:18:45.153 --> 00:18:50.320\nI go, and check my SharePoint sites\nthis is not one of the site to share of.\n\n341\n00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.770\nWhere it says Compliance Policy Center,\nso this another one that\n\n342\n00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:59.620\nallow me to keep the documents say, hey,\nif I wanna change that it's right here.\n\n343\n00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.090\nThat just you create deletion\npolicies on how long that this takes.\n\n344\n00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:10.080\nSo don't be caught unaware that\nyou might find out that you can't\n\n345\n00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:16.020\nset a policy here, or permissions to\nactually be able to delete anything,\n\n346\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.380\nwithout going through this center at well.\n\n347\n00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.910\nClassifications is exactly like it sounds.\n\n348\n00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.760\nThe very fact that we can classify data.\n\n349\n00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.310\nAnd have it labeled, so that now we\ncan make retention a lot easier, it\n\n350\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:32.970\nactually does help us out in what we need,\nwe can even assign a sensitivity type.\n\n351\n00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.130\nData loss prevention, this is something\nwe're gonna talk about a little bit later\n\n352\n00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:41.824\non, but realize that for us it's all\nabout data leakage, the unknowing, right.\n\n353\n00:19:41.824 --> 00:19:46.430\nThe ignorance of ourselves to\nnot actually not understand,\n\n354\n00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.770\nthat data may accidentally get leaked\nout by a person unintentionally.\n\n355\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:56.640\nWhen they say, I meant to send\nthis to Zack, but I accidentally\n\n356\n00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.500\nsent it out to this distribution list\nthat has more people on it than not.\n\n357\n00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.620\nWell this gives us the ability to\nactually take a look at policies,\n\n358\n00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:09.210\nthat we can set up to help\nus to stop stuff like that.\n\n359\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:14.280\nSo we can set up policies, device\nsecurity policies is another one where\n\n360\n00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:21.330\nwe also take a look at managing\nglobal device, mobile devices.\n\n361\n00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.350\nMDM a mobile device management center.\n\n362\n00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.060\nAnd you can see that I've added one\nhere in the mobile device management.\n\n363\n00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.910\nSo here's Justin Timberlake for\nanother desktop that's out there.\n\n364\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.850\nSo it's here that we can also set up\nthat management for mobile devices.\n\n365\n00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.750\nSmartphones, laptops that are out there,\n\n366\n00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.240\nthat are connected, we can actually manage\nthose things, shut it down if we want to.\n\n367\n00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.440\nAnd on this one, right now it says,\nwipe actions are not available right now.\n\n368\n00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.330\nBut if this laptop were lost I could,\nas long as somebody was plugged in.\n\n369\n00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.230\nA lot of times you could\nactually click on a button and\n\n370\n00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.280\njust remotely wipe that\ndevice if you wanted to.\n\n371\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.660\nSo it can be configured and done here too.\n\n372\n00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:03.300\nA little bit of a special warning about\niOS devices up here in the corner,\n\n373\n00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.660\nthat says, if you do this you\nneed this type of certificate.\n\n374\n00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:12.110\nThis APN certificate, so there's a lot of\nthings for you to explore and look at.\n\n375\n00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.850\nYou'll actually find that underneath\nthe data loss prevention policies too.\n\n376\n00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:18.836\nAs well as data governance as well, okay?\n\n377\n00:21:18.836 --> 00:21:21.649\nData governance is exactly like it sounds,\n\n378\n00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:25.069\nthat there is a lot of a data\nin which we must control and\n\n379\n00:21:25.069 --> 00:21:29.950\nkeeping the data making sure that we\nunderstand when to get rid of it, okay.\n\n380\n00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.525\nAnd when not too,\nit always is possibility.\n\n381\n00:21:32.525 --> 00:21:38.460\nWe've also in a previous episode configure\nthreat management in terms of the advance\n\n382\n00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.300\nthreat protection too, and we've talk\nabout safe link and safe attachment,\n\n383\n00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:48.090\nas well as using a quarantine, so\nwe could essentially set that aside, and\n\n384\n00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.620\nthen decide how long it\nremained in quarantine.\n\n385\n00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.910\nOr what we do with it if somebody\nneeds it out of quarantine.\n\n386\n00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.940\nSo you'll also end up seeing\nthat in that episode too.\n\n387\n00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.060\nAnd then of course eDiscovery and that's\nalso kind of the big feature that we also\n\n388\n00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.100\nshowed you in Exchange earlier\nin terms of configuration.\n\n389\n00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.195\nHow to configure eDiscovery?\n\n390\n00:22:06.195 --> 00:22:11.480\nE-discovery is great because it allows\nyou to go across the entirety of every\n\n391\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:17.080\nmailbox that you have and every system\nthat you have available to you.\n\n392\n00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.460\nIt's not just about one person's account.\n\n393\n00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.280\nIf you need every mention of\nZack's name in every email sent\n\n394\n00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.010\nthroughout my organization I can do that,\nokay.\n\n395\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.210\nWith eDiscovery I can to that.\n\n396\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:30.470\nAnd it mentions Zach, and\nthis date right May 11th.\n\n397\n00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:35.580\nIf it mentions that and\nit's in the future, six years from now.\n\n398\n00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.470\nAnd we have those retention policies set\nwhere we're keeping some of that stuff\n\n399\n00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:43.590\nforever, well I could go back not only\nacross Zach's mailbox, across mine, and\n\n400\n00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.810\nanybody in my organization,\neDiscovery can help us to do all that.\n\n401\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.370\nYou name it.\nIt's right there.\n\n402\n00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:53.730\nAnd of course, reporting, and this\nlast one I want to also show you here.\n\n403\n00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:54.795\nReports makes sense, right?\n\n404\n00:22:54.795 --> 00:22:57.360\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n&gt;&gt; You can get the sense here that, hey,\n\n405\n00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.120\nhere's I know that everything's working\nthe way that we set it up to work.\n\n406\n00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.830\nBut service assurance is neat.\n\n407\n00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.730\nIt is an unusual one that we have\nhere that gives us the ability\n\n408\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.750\nto maintain security, privacy,\nand compliance here and\n\n409\n00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.630\nit does it according to best\npractices even for Microsoft.\n\n410\n00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:22.430\nNow when you start doing\nsomething in terms of the service\n\n411\n00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.370\nassurance it is going to\nallow you here in a moment.\n\n412\n00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.590\nLet me see if I can, let me see if I\ncan get to the place where I was going.\n\n413\n00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.820\nSettings is where I want to go, because\nit's kinda the neat one that you have.\n\n414\n00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.200\nIf you start to set this stuff up,\nyou have to pick a region and\n\n415\n00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.880\nan industry that you are in.\n\n416\n00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.990\nThen you can pick the region like\nNorth America, Asian Pacific, Australia,\n\n417\n00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.330\nand you name it and the industry.\n\n418\n00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.430\nAnd it knows how to go,\n\n419\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.630\nand find that kind of compliance\nthat's actually in to help you out.\n\n420\n00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.390\n&gt;&gt; Did that have to tie in\nwith data sovereignty, or\n\n421\n00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.700\ndoes it tie into that, I mean?\n\n422\n00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.890\n&gt;&gt; To a point, right?\n\n423\n00:23:55.890 --> 00:24:00.910\nSo the very fact is it gives you at least\nthose settings that you can now go,\n\n424\n00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:01.750\nall right.\n\n425\n00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.450\nI wanna be able to use that\nin my organization too.\n\n426\n00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.460\nOnce you choose that though, and\n\n427\n00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.670\nI click save here this is where it gets,\nI already saved it, so that's good.\n\n428\n00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:17.131\nSo there comes a point where it tells you\nlike, look from this point on, you're not\n\n429\n00:24:17.131 --> 00:24:21.467\nallowed to show this because, it means\nthat once you've clicked this you have to\n\n430\n00:24:21.467 --> 00:24:25.867\nask permission from Microsoft, a written\npermission to be able to show the rest of\n\n431\n00:24:25.867 --> 00:24:30.390\nthe information cuz they're using some\nproprietary stuff that's behind there.\n\n432\n00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:36.200\nIt says, if you use this, don't show\nanybody but you're allowed to use it but\n\n433\n00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.600\nyou're not allowed to, like me, display\nall the information that is showing.\n\n434\n00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.160\nThat's why I'm not really\ngoing back into this stuff\n\n435\n00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.530\ncuz really there's a big warning,\nright in that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n436\n00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:47.520\nYou're kind of guaranteeing,\nyou're entering a contract that we're not\n\n437\n00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.880\ngonna do this idea that\nyou're actually seeing.\n\n438\n00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:56.440\nSo there are a lot of different controls\nthat we have right here available to us.\n\n439\n00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.710\nWhen we start to take a look at setting\nup some of those things globally.\n\n440\n00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.848\nBut the key here is remember\nglobal settings are good but\n\n441\n00:25:03.848 --> 00:25:08.137\nthey can't apply in every little\ninstance and specification that we have.\n\n442\n00:25:08.137 --> 00:25:14.937\nSometimes you will have to go in there\nto that particular admin center and\n\n443\n00:25:14.937 --> 00:25:21.090\nset those things up the way that\nwe need to, to add that in.\n\n444\n00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.210\nAnd unfortunately for you, and me,\nsince we're talking about planning for\n\n445\n00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.262\nexchange, exchange is one of the big ones.\n\n446\n00:25:27.262 --> 00:25:30.390\nHere's like, you can set up some\nof the global settings, but\n\n447\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:34.020\nin reality though, you're gonna\nstay in the exchange admin center.\n\n448\n00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.240\nAnd that means you're gonna have\nto dig around a lot more in there.\n\n449\n00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.170\nBut we're actually gonna see some\nof those different policies, and\n\n450\n00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.160\nwe're gonna get them set up as well.\n\n451\n00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.540\nAnd we'll see that in previous episodes.\n\n452\n00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.230\nBut we also wanna talk about\nthe planning for them and\n\n453\n00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.900\nwe'll show you some of\nthe configurations too.\n\n454\n00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.530\nBut that's gonna have to wait for\nanother episode,\n\n455\n00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.860\nZach because I apparently have\ntalked way too long again.\n\n456\n00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.050\n&gt;&gt; But you did a wonderful job.\n\n457\n00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:55.840\nThank you very much.\n\n458\n00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.410\nI guess we're gonna pick it up\nwith the enable legal hold, right?\n\n459\n00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.480\nWhen we start with number two.\n\n460\n00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.380\nSo you've been watching plan for\nexchange online part one,\n\n461\n00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.900\npart two is coming up, you want to\nsee everything in this series of\n\n462\n00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.960\nenabling Office 365 services,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n463\n00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.420\nWhen you watching ITPro.TV\nyou'll remember a good ITPro is\n\n464\n00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.340\nalways learning I'm Zachary Memos.\n\n465\n00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.140\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.853\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and\n\n4\n00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:16.813\nthank you for watching ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:20.968\nI'm your host Zack Memos, for\nenabling Office 365 services,\n\n6\n00:00:20.968 --> 00:00:24.986\nas we continue now with our topic\nPlanning for Exchange Online.\n\n7\n00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:28.310\nThis is Part two with Ronnie Wong,\nour IT Pro.\n\n8\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.070\nRonnie, let's go.\n\n9\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.180\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you again for\nhaving me on the show,\n\n10\n00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.350\nas we start to take a look at some of the\nother features that we need to talk about.\n\n11\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.170\nSo when we start Planning for\nExchange Online, in the previous episode,\n\n12\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.700\nwe really did talk about using\nthat Security &amp; Compliance Center,\n\n13\n00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.330\nwhere we can configure\nsome things globally.\n\n14\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.680\nWe also set up of\ncourse,archiving a little bit.\n\n15\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.340\nAnd made sure that you realized,\nbecause this is a planning.\n\n16\n00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.040\nSo we really talked about it and\nshowed you where it was.\n\n17\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.470\nBut go back in to configuring\nExchange Online and\n\n18\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.050\nyou'll see all those configurations.\n\n19\n00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.700\nWe spent a pretty good bid of time in\nmaking sure that we did both of those.\n\n20\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.300\nSo, we don't want you to feel like I\nknow that hey did he just do this?\n\n21\n00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.571\nThis is a repeat episode and\nit's not a repeat episode.\n\n22\n00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:10.350\nBut it was really a planning stage,\n\n23\n00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.041\nand of course we talked about the ideas\nof planning and what we need there.\n\n24\n00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:20.420\nNow, here's where the Security &amp;\nCompliance Center doesn't really fit in.\n\n25\n00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.620\nWhen it comes down to Exchange,\nExchange has been around for a long time.\n\n26\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.320\nActually even before Office 365\nwas around, Exchange was around.\n\n27\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.170\nSo that product is a very matured product.\n\n28\n00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.530\nIt has set essentially\nthe standard in how you\n\n29\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.830\ndeal with like the big Microsoft products.\n\n30\n00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.790\nWhen it comes down to it,\nit is kind of the big guy in the room.\n\n31\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.909\nIt knows exactly what it wants to do, and\nit doesn't like change a ton of times.\n\n32\n00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.748\nAnd the reason why I wanted\nto mention that is that,\n\n33\n00:01:51.748 --> 00:01:54.720\nwhen it comes down to\nSecurity &amp; Compliance Center,\n\n34\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.303\nit may actually affect just\nabout everything in Office 365.\n\n35\n00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:02.194\nBut when they started saying,\nlet's also do this with Exchange,\n\n36\n00:02:02.194 --> 00:02:05.010\nthe Exchange product itself said, no way.\n\n37\n00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.520\nI'm the big brother here.\n\n38\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.550\nI'm not changing.\n\n39\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.930\nI will do things the way that I do things,\nand\n\n40\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.880\nyou're just gonna have to\nlearn how to deal with that.\n\n41\n00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.040\nSo you will see certain things in\nthat Security &amp; Compliance Center.\n\n42\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.500\nWhich you're not gonna be\nable to effect a change.\n\n43\n00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.940\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n44\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.980\nSo that means we need to spend more\ntime in the Exchange admin center,\n\n45\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.140\nto be able to do this.\n\n46\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.850\nSo one of those features that\nwe definitely did configure and\n\n47\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.575\nthat we wanna talk about,\nis of course enabling the legal hold.\n\n48\n00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:38.760\nIt's what we want to do especially\nwhen it comes down to Exchange.\n\n49\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.160\nNow when we start talking about,\n\n50\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.430\nlet's make sure that we understand\nwhat we mean by a legal hold here.\n\n51\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.000\nThis helps us to preserve all of\nthe mailbox content for somebody that has\n\n52\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.360\nan Exchange mailbox, including deleted\nitems and modified items, as well.\n\n53\n00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.570\nUser archives,\ndeleted items are normally going to be,\n\n54\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.740\nwhen it comes down to a legal hold.\n\n55\n00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.460\nThey're going to be held there for\na particular hold time,\n\n56\n00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.360\nhowever long we actually set that policy\nfor, or until we say it can be removed.\n\n57\n00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.870\nSo it can be either permanent that's\nthere until we go, we're done with it.\n\n58\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.630\nOr we can set it for\na particular period of time and\n\n59\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.360\nthen we're no longer holding it,\nwe're no longer having to do that.\n\n60\n00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.110\nSo, that's the way the legal\nhold essentially works.\n\n61\n00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.620\nThe great thing is it works very well.\n\n62\n00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.580\nThe standard default size for\nthis legal hold for\n\n63\n00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.960\nsomebody's mailbox,\nis normally 30 gigabytes.\n\n64\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.670\nNow, that's a pretty darn big size.\n\n65\n00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.430\nMost of us are never going\nto use that much, but\n\n66\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.420\nthat's the default size that it sets up.\n\n67\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.550\nIf you need more it's strange, it will\nallow you to save more especially when\n\n68\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.830\nyou're archiving and then you're\nalso putting a legal hold on it.\n\n69\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.760\nBut you might find out that it may also\ncost you a little bit more too, but\n\n70\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.830\njust kinda realize it is there.\n\n71\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, this legal hold,\nis that an example of yes?\n\n72\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.430\n&gt;&gt; Yes, when it comes down to it,\nit's one of those examples in which we go,\n\n73\n00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.490\ncan I do this in the Security\n&amp; Compliance Center?\n\n74\n00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.590\nNo, but do I need to go into\nthe Exchange atmosphere and do it?\n\n75\n00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.910\nYes, so this is one of those in which\nwe're not gonna be able to manage that.\n\n76\n00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.748\nSo when it comes down to it,\nwhen I said that Security &amp; Compliance\n\n77\n00:04:11.748 --> 00:04:16.217\ncenter do I have to do everything here,\nor is there one place for me to do this?\n\n78\n00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:20.113\nWell in that point, yes, this is something\nyou have to do only in Exchange, so\n\n79\n00:04:20.113 --> 00:04:22.192\nthat's what we're talking about here.\n\n80\n00:04:22.192 --> 00:04:26.266\nNow, once you set this up especially\nif you set up a time period,\n\n81\n00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:30.417\nsome of the elements that you do\nhave to know, that default time or\n\n82\n00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:33.030\nthat default size is kinda key.\n\n83\n00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.970\nAnd then, what does it mean when you\nset up a timeline for it to hold?\n\n84\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.420\nWell, this is normally set from\nthe day that it is actually received\n\n85\n00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.930\ninto your mailbox, or\nthe day that you create the item itself.\n\n86\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.130\nSo it's not one year since\nthe day that you have,\n\n87\n00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.940\nI enabled legal hold on Zack's mailbox.\n\n88\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.518\nWhen Zack actually-\n&gt;&gt; You did?\n\n89\n00:04:54.518 --> 00:04:55.092\n&gt;&gt; Three days.\n\n90\n00:04:55.092 --> 00:04:58.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, three days from now if he creates\n\n91\n00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.620\nan email, it's from the time he created it\nuntil whatever that retention period is.\n\n92\n00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.330\nSo if I set it for a year,\nit's a year from that time.\n\n93\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.170\nIt's not a year from today\nif I set it up today.\n\n94\n00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.360\nSo, just make sure you understand a year\nfrom the day that you create it, or\n\n95\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.420\nthe day that I sent Zack the email.\n\n96\n00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.680\nAnd it's a years time from that.\n\n97\n00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.120\nSo it's kind of this unusual rolling\ncalendar of things that's happening that\n\n98\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.820\neven though when someone says well, how do\nyou know when it begins and when it ends.\n\n99\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.786\nYou really don't.\n\n100\n00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:33.628\nIf you reset it for five years from now,\n\n101\n00:05:33.628 --> 00:05:37.765\nthat means five years until\nthe very last email you send,\n\n102\n00:05:37.765 --> 00:05:42.699\nit's five years even from that date\nthat that last item can be held.\n\n103\n00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.452\nBut all those other ones that\nmight have been sent years and\n\n104\n00:05:45.452 --> 00:05:47.362\nprevious, that were two years before or\n\n105\n00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:51.510\nwhatever, it may even be gone if they\nhave outside of that five year period.\n\n106\n00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.710\nBut those last ones will still be there,\n\n107\n00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.840\nit's kind of really amazing when\nyou start thinking about it.\n\n108\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.330\nBut you do want to make sure\nthat you remember that.\n\n109\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.070\nOnce you set it up though,\nit doesn't take place immediately either.\n\n110\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.310\nThat's another gotcha that\nreally can be of a conundrum.\n\n111\n00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.140\nSo you don't normally just\nset this up on a whim.\n\n112\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.140\nThat's what we're trying to tell you.\n\n113\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.910\nWhen you start enabling the legal hold,\nit can take up to an hour for everything\n\n114\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.760\nto take effect for that person's mailbox,\nis what you end up seeing.\n\n115\n00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.440\nSo, let's take a look at where we go and\nfind this configuration inside the UAC.\n\n116\n00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.700\nUAC, what the heck am\nI even talking about?\n\n117\n00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.580\nThe EAC, inside the EAC here.\n\n118\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.890\nAnd then, we'll also show you of course in\nPowerShell, how you enable this as well.\n\n119\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:36.760\nSo here it is.\n\n120\n00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.490\nI went ahead and created a tab for\nthe Exchange admin center.\n\n121\n00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.010\nAnd underneath recipients here.\n\n122\n00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.550\nI'm gonna select mailboxes.\n\n123\n00:06:47.887 --> 00:06:53.090\nAnd once I select mailboxes, I can now go\ninto the individual mailbox that I want.\n\n124\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.070\nBy double clicking on whoever the user is.\n\n125\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.950\nToday it looks like it's\nactually being a little bit slow.\n\n126\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.670\nThen, we're gonna see on the left hand\nside where it says Mailbox Features, and\n\n127\n00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.320\nit's still not easy to\nfind once I do that.\n\n128\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.021\nSo let me pick on the one I've been\npicking on pretty much during the whole\n\n129\n00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:09.761\nshow here,\nwhich is Lance's email box here.\n\n130\n00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:14.894\nAnd once I get Lance's email box up,\n\n131\n00:07:14.894 --> 00:07:19.021\nnotice that I’m looking for\nmailbox features.\n\n132\n00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:23.150\nAnd now within mailbox features,\nwe’ll give it a moment.\n\n133\n00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.850\nAnd you start looking, and\n\n134\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.960\nthis is where we kind of get a little\nbit tricked out a little bit.\n\n135\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.910\nIt says Phone and Voice Features,\nMailbox Devices, is that the end?\n\n136\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.870\nWell no, you have to kind of\nsee that there’s this kind of,\n\n137\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:45.040\nthere's a scroll bar and if I select\nthe scroll bar and I come down here, you\n\n138\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.310\ncan now see where it says Litigation hold,\nand currently it is Disabled right now.\n\n139\n00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.872\nFor me to enable it, fairly easy.\n\n140\n00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:56.352\nClick on the little link here that\nsays Enable, and you are done, and\n\n141\n00:07:56.352 --> 00:07:57.618\nyou have now enabled it.\n\n142\n00:07:57.618 --> 00:08:00.820\nBut it may take up to an hour\nbefore it actually does take place.\n\n143\n00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.019\nSo just realize that.\n\n144\n00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:04.104\n&gt;&gt; You have to do that in the PowerShell,\nRonnie?\n\n145\n00:08:04.104 --> 00:08:07.570\n&gt;&gt; We still do have to do this\nin the PowerShell, as well.\n\n146\n00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.800\nAnd you might wonder, why?\n\n147\n00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.328\nBecause more than likely, you're\ngonna be scripting this out, not for\n\n148\n00:08:11.328 --> 00:08:16.930\njust one individual, but possibly for\neverybody in your organization too.\n\n149\n00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.450\nSo let me bring up\nthe PowerShell prompt here\n\n150\n00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.362\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Pretty colors.\n\n151\n00:08:20.362 --> 00:08:22.960\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah, some pretty colors,\nyou have the red up here where\n\n152\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.370\nI typed in something wrong and\nthen everything else here.\n\n153\n00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:30.611\nBut let me do the get-ps session,\njust to make sure I'm still connected.\n\n154\n00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:31.808\n&gt;&gt; You're still connected, right.\n\n155\n00:08:31.808 --> 00:08:34.630\n&gt;&gt; It hasn't broken, yep,\nI always have to do that.\n\n156\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.560\nAnd here, you're actually seeing\na couple of different things.\n\n157\n00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.840\nAnd this is where it's difficult,\n\n158\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.600\nbecause even though it says under the\nConfigurationName that it says Exchange\n\n159\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.050\nand that we are available,\nnotice it's twice and it says opened.\n\n160\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.770\nBut it's right over here\nunder ComputerName,\n\n161\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.784\nyou'll see it's actually connecting\nto two different things.\n\n162\n00:08:51.784 --> 00:08:57.431\noutlook.office365, that's\nconnecting to Exchange Online,\n\n163\n00:08:57.431 --> 00:09:03.675\nnam01b.ps., whatever this is, and\nyou don't know what that is here.\n\n164\n00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:09.170\nBut if I show you what that is,\nit'll make a little bit more sense here.\n\n165\n00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.160\nSo up at the top, it's telling me, hey,\n\n166\n00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.258\nhere is where you're connecting to,\nwhich is compliance protection.\n\n167\n00:09:15.258 --> 00:09:18.910\nAnd this is the short cut essentially\nto the admin center, that security and\n\n168\n00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.420\ncompliance admin center.\n\n169\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.360\nSo I've connected to both of them is what\nI've done here, just in case I needed to\n\n170\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.200\ntype PowerShell commands in both\nof them to be able to do this.\n\n171\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.590\nSo if we start to take a look\nat Lance's mailbox here,\n\n172\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.370\nso if I type in get mailbox and\n\n173\n00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.300\nthen lance here, that should show me\nhis particular mailbox, which is great,\n\n174\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.010\nand that's exactly what I want to do.\n\n175\n00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.130\nNow if I want to enable his legal hold,\nlet me clear off the screen, so\n\n176\n00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.556\nwe can start at the top,\nmake it a little bit easier here.\n\n177\n00:09:53.556 --> 00:09:59.812\nI'm going to set mailbox and then\n\n178\n00:09:59.812 --> 00:10:09.205\nlance@officeprodemogo.onmicrosoft.com-\n\n179\n00:10:11.549 --> 00:10:14.010\nLitigation hold duration.\n\n180\n00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.110\nThat's not what I want,\nI don't want the duration.\n\n181\n00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.940\n&gt;&gt; Enabled?\n\n182\n00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.710\n&gt;&gt; I want where it says enabled here.\n\n183\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.880\nNow, this is where it's\na little bit strange, right?\n\n184\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.583\nInstead of just saying on or off, which\nwould be easy, this is gonna be of course\n\n185\n00:10:27.583 --> 00:10:29.889\nfor right now here, where-\n&gt;&gt; True or false.\n\n186\n00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:34.200\n&gt;&gt; Yep, true or false, so\nI want to set this up as being true.\n\n187\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.260\nAnd if I do this in this way and\n\n188\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:43.620\npress Enter, that will go ahead and\nenable that litigation hold.\n\n189\n00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.550\nNow the unusual thing about this\nis notice where it says hey,\n\n190\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.220\nthis may take up to 60 minutes\nto take effect, which is fine.\n\n191\n00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.260\nBut without any other\nadditional arguments,\n\n192\n00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.670\nthis takes hold indefinitely,\nis what ends up happening here.\n\n193\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.530\nSo that means it's gonna\nhold it until I turn it off,\n\n194\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.580\nis what we would actually end up having.\n\n195\n00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.740\nSo then if you want to turn it off,\nit's pretty much easy.\n\n196\n00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.450\nInstead, you'd actually enter in Faults\nhere, is what you would end up doing.\n\n197\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.470\nNow I'm not gonna worry about doing that\nright now because that will actually,\n\n198\n00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.640\nit makes sense, right?\n\n199\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.969\nIf one is true, the other one is false\nhere, but that will remove it for us, and\n\n200\n00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:24.350\nthat's actually something good.\n\n201\n00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.140\nBut there are times though where you\nalso will need to make sure then that\n\n202\n00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.580\nyou can set a duration.\n\n203\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.740\nSo, just like where we saw\nlegal hold duration and\n\n204\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.838\nstuff, you can set that up, and\nyou can add in additional options.\n\n205\n00:11:36.838 --> 00:11:37.740\nWe're not gonna do it for\n\n206\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.975\nright now because I'm ready having it\nwhere it's taking effect in 60 minutes.\n\n207\n00:11:41.975 --> 00:11:45.620\nSend too many commands, it might just go,\nthere's a ton of stuff that's going on,\n\n208\n00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.710\nso let me not try and\noverload everything for right now.\n\n209\n00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.300\nNow, once I get this and\n\n210\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.700\nI wanna verify that it's done, let's go\nahead and kind of run another command.\n\n211\n00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.879\nIf I do a get mailbox now for Lance,\n\n212\n00:12:02.934 --> 00:12:09.971\nOfficeprodemoco.on, Microsoft.com,\n\n213\n00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:16.010\nhopefully I spelled it correctly.\n\n214\n00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.610\nSometimes my eyes start to cross\nwhen I start seeing this here.\n\n215\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:25.327\nThen I can pipe this\ninto a formatted list.\n\n216\n00:12:30.076 --> 00:12:38.423\nAnd let's see, litigation [LAUGH]\nhold is what I have to do.\n\n217\n00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:39.178\n&gt;&gt; You're doing great.\n\n218\n00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:43.140\n&gt;&gt; And I can't type,\nI'm trying to make sure.\n\n219\n00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.218\nI'm also gonna put an asterisk\nat the end of this.\n\n220\n00:12:46.218 --> 00:12:50.778\nI'm telling it hey, get for me everything\nthat begins with the word litigation hold,\n\n221\n00:12:50.778 --> 00:12:52.594\nand let me see those settings too.\n\n222\n00:12:52.594 --> 00:12:56.180\nSo in a moment, you can see that\nthere's a few of them, right?\n\n223\n00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.160\nThe first one is the one that\nactually did enable, which is fine.\n\n224\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.880\nBut notice there's a HoldDate,\nthere's a HoldOwner.\n\n225\n00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.850\nWho actually owns this here?\n\n226\n00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.250\nAnd then the duration,\nwithout setting a complete date or\n\n227\n00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.910\na particular number of days,\nnotice it says unlimited.\n\n228\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.510\nSo you will see this, and\nit's normally done in terms of days.\n\n229\n00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:19.930\nSo, if you want it for ten years,\nit would be 3,650 days, I mean that's\n\n230\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.880\nwhat you'd actually set in there for\nthe actual time period, if you wanted to.\n\n231\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.080\n&gt;&gt; Is it true that every mailbox\nis set for a year, it's like,\n\n232\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.362\nthat's the standard?\n\n233\n00:13:28.362 --> 00:13:32.518\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can,\nit does give you that ability, right?\n\n234\n00:13:32.518 --> 00:13:36.693\nSo remember that this is not a feature\nthat's normally turned on by default,\n\n235\n00:13:36.693 --> 00:13:38.310\nit is not enabled by default.\n\n236\n00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:42.100\nBut if you set it up, you can set it for\na year, you can set it for ten years,\n\n237\n00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.890\nyou can set it for whatever you want to.\n\n238\n00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.700\nSo it is possible.\n\n239\n00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.250\nNow what if you wanted to do this for\neveryone?\n\n240\n00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.210\nYou go okay, this is working out.\n\n241\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.290\nI did this on my test account,\nit looks like it's working, and\n\n242\n00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.690\nyou wanna actually create this for\neveryone.\n\n243\n00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.410\nThen you could go ahead and\ndo the same thing here.\n\n244\n00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.123\nAnd instead, when you do this for\neveryone, you have to get every mailbox.\n\n245\n00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.238\nThen we've gotta do the result size, so\nwe're telling it, don't limit yourself,\n\n246\n00:14:10.238 --> 00:14:12.701\nand the result size is gonna be unlimited.\n\n247\n00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:15.539\nSo in other words, go and grab every\nsingle mailbox that's out there and\n\n248\n00:14:15.539 --> 00:14:17.530\neverything that's in it.\n\n249\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.960\nThen we're gonna do a filter.\n\n250\n00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.634\nWe have to use fancy brackets.\n\n251\n00:14:21.634 --> 00:14:27.795\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; RecipientTypeDetails,\n\n252\n00:14:27.795 --> 00:14:33.164\nand that's gonna eq for equal.\n\n253\n00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:37.404\nOops, if I can do an eq, that's a wq,\n\n254\n00:14:37.404 --> 00:14:42.406\nuser, oops, let me, Mailbox.\n\n255\n00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:46.318\n&gt;&gt; End quote marks.\n\n256\n00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:48.360\n&gt;&gt; And end quote marks here, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.030\nSo that will get every single mailbox for\nme,\n\n258\n00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:56.676\nthen I need to pipe that into\na set command, set mailbox.\n\n259\n00:14:59.533 --> 00:15:05.500\nThen litigation hold,\nLitigation [LAUGH] hold.\n\n260\n00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.174\n&gt;&gt; Almost there.\n\n261\n00:15:06.174 --> 00:15:08.613\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah, [LAUGH] enabled.\n\n262\n00:15:08.613 --> 00:15:11.180\n&gt;&gt; And this is gonna verify state of hold.\n\n263\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.330\n&gt;&gt; It should, so if I wanted to\nturn that on, I would do that.\n\n264\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.208\nAnd then, if I wanted to set\na particular period of time,\n\n265\n00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:24.300\nlitigation duration here.\n\n266\n00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.870\nI could do it for a year, or if I wanna\ndo it for ten years, it would be that.\n\n267\n00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.645\nSo you can actually set that up.\n\n268\n00:15:30.645 --> 00:15:39.010\nAnd now, oops,\nit didn't like my typing here.\n\n269\n00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.220\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, I see that we've\ndone something wrong here.\n\n270\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.700\nWhat did we do wrong?\n\n271\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, once again like anything else,\n\n272\n00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.810\nwhen I have to type something,\nit more than likely is a typo.\n\n273\n00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.464\nAnd that's what we're\nstarting to see here.\n\n274\n00:15:49.464 --> 00:15:50.657\nAnd if I take a look,\n\n275\n00:15:50.657 --> 00:15:54.802\nit was something that I had said right\nat the beginning that cued me in,\n\n276\n00:15:54.802 --> 00:15:59.040\nwhich is this fancy bracket up here\nat the very Right here, as I zoom in.\n\n277\n00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.083\nAnd I realize, I did not have\nan ending fancy bracket somewhere.\n\n278\n00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.487\n&gt;&gt; So you need all those fancy brackets.\n\n279\n00:16:04.487 --> 00:16:07.360\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah,\nsometimes you just have to have them.\n\n280\n00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.620\nSo I wanna make sure that I\nactually get all this right.\n\n281\n00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:14.245\nFancy brackets, from that point,\nI don't need any other brackets over here.\n\n282\n00:16:14.245 --> 00:16:20.360\nAnd now, if I get more red marks,\nthen we're in some other issue here.\n\n283\n00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.310\nNot to be able to get to\nthe end of this line.\n\n284\n00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:26.900\nThere we go.\n\n285\n00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.880\nI didn't set a parameter, what?\n\n286\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.353\nLet me see here.\n\n287\n00:16:32.353 --> 00:16:37.790\nLet's see, litigation hold,\nwhat are the parameter.\n\n288\n00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.760\nThe duration,\nI forgot to actually add the duration.\n\n289\n00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.100\nAnd how's that?\n\n290\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.700\nI think I just deleted it out.\n\n291\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.300\nSo now it's just telling me hey,\nyou forgot to set a particular number.\n\n292\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.595\n&gt;&gt; Like a year, ten year-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n293\n00:16:48.595 --> 00:16:52.468\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Ronnie, is this another typo,\nor is this a command problem?\n\n294\n00:16:52.468 --> 00:16:55.724\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or not,\nthis is neither one this time.\n\n295\n00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:56.761\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n296\n00:16:56.761 --> 00:16:57.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's strange.\n\n297\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.190\nEven though we were looking at this\nas you were talking, Zack, and\n\n298\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.830\nas I was looking at it,\nI did end up with these two lines here.\n\n299\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:09.650\nThat said the hold setting may take\neffect in up to, well up to 60 minutes.\n\n300\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.190\nSo it took the command, but\nbecause I had run them so\n\n301\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.520\nclose together It didn't like it.\n\n302\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.045\nSo what it was was a timing issue\nat this particular point is what\n\n303\n00:17:19.045 --> 00:17:20.585\nwe ended up seeing.\n\n304\n00:17:20.585 --> 00:17:21.470\n&gt;&gt; Timing.\n\n305\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.975\n&gt;&gt; Yes this was a timing issue so\n\n306\n00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:26.800\nif i hadn't pressed like Enter two times\nin a row because I was in a hurry,\n\n307\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.475\nit probably would have just said\nall right just give me 30 seconds.\n\n308\n00:17:30.475 --> 00:17:35.849\nOr give me a minute and watch, and\nthat's exactly what we did here.\n\n309\n00:17:35.849 --> 00:17:39.263\nIs that we just gave it a few seconds so\nwhen I pressed enter again,\n\n310\n00:17:39.263 --> 00:17:40.390\nit took it this time.\n\n311\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.700\nAnd it just said now you're seeing\nexactly what ended up happening.\n\n312\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.483\nSo in all of these here,\nit really does end up working and\n\n313\n00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:50.560\nthis should now apply to all\nthe mailboxes that we have.\n\n314\n00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.170\n&gt;&gt; And what's really great\nabout ITProTV is you can now,\n\n315\n00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.740\nas you're watching this,\nor watching it later.\n\n316\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.390\nYou can stop and you can take notes,\nyou can take a look at this more closely.\n\n317\n00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.950\nIt's awesome.\n\n318\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthat should actually do it now.\n\n319\n00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:08.260\nI actually also see something else\nthat as we start to take a look here.\n\n320\n00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.530\nSo once this takes place, you're actually\ngonna end up seeing where that mailbox\n\n321\n00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.180\nhold will end up happening and\nwill be fine.\n\n322\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.170\nThe great thing is right now, I can't\nremember if in the other episode where we\n\n323\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.960\ndid the configuring if I had to actually\nrun this command for, I think I have.\n\n324\n00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.890\nBut I just wanted to make sure\nthat we showed you again.\n\n325\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:29.020\nOn that second one for everybody, you have\nto get all those mailboxes first, and\n\n326\n00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.160\nthen you can set the litigation\nhold the way that you want to.\n\n327\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now on the exam though,\n\n328\n00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.450\ndon't be surprised if they\ndon't call it litigation hold.\n\n329\n00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.000\nYou may hear the term legal hold, and\nit means the same thing for us, so\n\n330\n00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.380\nmake sure you take a look at this one too,\nokay?\n\n331\n00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:51.040\nNow the other thing that we also want to\ntalk about here is configuring OWA access.\n\n332\n00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.220\nNow when we start talking\nabout configuring OWA access,\n\n333\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.705\nit allows then users to be able to\nuse what we call the OutLook Web App.\n\n334\n00:18:58.705 --> 00:19:02.130\nAnd this is actually something\nthat's very good for us here.\n\n335\n00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:07.923\nIf you don't have the OWA feature turned\non, the only way that you can send and\n\n336\n00:19:07.923 --> 00:19:12.490\nreceive email, not receive,\nsend emails I should say.\n\n337\n00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.210\nThe only way you can send\nemails is if you have\n\n338\n00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.630\nsomething like Outlook\nrunning on your computer.\n\n339\n00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.400\nSo you have to have an email\nclient on your computer.\n\n340\n00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.820\nNow, what about receiving?\n\n341\n00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.510\nYou'll receive emails, okay?\n\n342\n00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.950\nYour inbox will actually continue\nto receive emails all day long.\n\n343\n00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.620\nBut for you to be able to reply to it,\n\n344\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.380\nto do anything with it, you'll have\nto have some client on your computer.\n\n345\n00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.500\nSome software that says here's\nan email that was sent to you, and\n\n346\n00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.250\nthen you can reply to it.\n\n347\n00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:41.780\nBut with OWA, you just need access\nto well, your Office 365 account.\n\n348\n00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:46.010\nYou can click on the Mail icon and\nfrom there, you can now use that and\n\n349\n00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.640\nbe able to get connected all\nthe way through to do this.\n\n350\n00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.578\nNow, when we start to take\na look on setting than up,\n\n351\n00:19:51.578 --> 00:19:53.574\nthe great thing is this is\nnormally set up by default.\n\n352\n00:19:53.574 --> 00:19:56.460\nBut let's make sure we understand\nwhere that's gonna be.\n\n353\n00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:04.300\nOnce I'm actually here inside of Mailboxes\non the EAC, I can then select Lance.\n\n354\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:09.410\nAnd once we actually select Lance, we're\ngoing back to the mailbox features again.\n\n355\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.300\nAnd then we're gonna scroll down and\n\n356\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.800\nwhat I'm looking for\nis right here under mail device.\n\n357\n00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.560\nNotice it says, Mobile Devices, excuse me.\n\n358\n00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.640\nDisable OWA for\n\n359\n00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.080\nDevices here, that's another one\nthat you'll actually end up seeing.\n\n360\n00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.650\nMake sure I'm actually\ntelling you correctly here.\n\n361\n00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.690\nAnd then, if I scroll down, there it is.\n\n362\n00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.700\nNotice right here, so\nthere's a couple of them.\n\n363\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.430\nIf you want this on your phone,\nthat's the one there.\n\n364\n00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.710\nBut this is what's the OWA,\nthe Outlook on the web, and\n\n365\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.040\nyou can see where this is\nactually enabled for you.\n\n366\n00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:46.690\nYou don't have that,\n\n367\n00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:51.020\nit just means you're gonna have Outlook\non your own computer to get that set up.\n\n368\n00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.540\nIf you want to set this up\ninside of PowerShell though,\n\n369\n00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.460\nthis is where you now get to\nsee a new command for us.\n\n370\n00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.686\nSo let me do a get cas,\nwhich is Client Access System here,\n\n371\n00:21:03.686 --> 00:21:11.110\ncas mailbox for Lance.\n\n372\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.530\nAnd you can see right here,\nwhere it actually does say,\n\n373\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.890\nOWA is enabled and true.\n\n374\n00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:24.349\nIf I want to run the command\nthat disables this,\n\n375\n00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:30.139\nI can do set cas mailbox, identity.\n\n376\n00:21:30.139 --> 00:21:32.796\nIf I can spell identity.\n\n377\n00:21:32.796 --> 00:21:33.620\n&gt;&gt; There's a d in it.\n\n378\n00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.717\n&gt;&gt; And then OWA enabled here and\n\n379\n00:21:37.717 --> 00:21:41.990\nthis one I would set to false.\n\n380\n00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:43.710\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n381\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.370\n&gt;&gt; Now if I run that same command again,\n\n382\n00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:50.220\nyou should be able to see the difference\nbetween the two, under OWA here, right?\n\n383\n00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.670\nOne is True, and\nnow this one is now set to False.\n\n384\n00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n385\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.420\n&gt;&gt; So you wanna make sure that\nthat is actually possible and\n\n386\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.510\nthat you can verify this too.\n\n387\n00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.950\nSimple commands, but\n\n388\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.890\nagain it's some thing that you want\nto make sure that you understand.\n\n389\n00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.970\nIt can be done in both situations.\n\n390\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.030\nThis one again is PowerShell and\n\n391\n00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.220\nthat's more than likely to be tested\non the exam so don't get away from it.\n\n392\n00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:15.700\nAnother particular feature that we have is\nwe're gonna take a look at something that\n\n393\n00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.240\nwe call ActiveSync and\nMobile Device Management.\n\n394\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.210\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask you about that.\n\n395\n00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now,\nwhen we start to take a look at this,\n\n396\n00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.900\nthis is a little bit more unusual\nin the very fact that we want a lot\n\n397\n00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:32.120\nof times our data to be able to\nbe on multiple devices, okay?\n\n398\n00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.814\nSo I don't only want it on my\ndesktop computer where I work,\n\n399\n00:22:34.814 --> 00:22:35.350\nI want it on my laptop.\n\n400\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:40.254\nI want it on my mobile phone,\nI want it everywhere, on my iPad,\n\n401\n00:22:40.254 --> 00:22:42.024\nI want it everywhere.\n\n402\n00:22:42.024 --> 00:22:46.056\nNow when I start doing stuff like that,\nwe now need to make sure that\n\n403\n00:22:46.056 --> 00:22:50.540\nthat stuff is synchronized across\nall those devices as well.\n\n404\n00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:55.100\nAnd we also need to be able to control\nthose devices to a point where if\n\n405\n00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.010\nZach was now, let's say that\nhe got issued a company phone.\n\n406\n00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:03.290\nAnd he comes in and goes, Ronnie,\nI lost that company phone.\n\n407\n00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:06.240\nWe were at Disney World and\nit's just gone.\n\n408\n00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.075\nWell it's bad enough that\nZach lost the phone but\n\n409\n00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:10.514\nit might be the data on it that's\nmore important to the company.\n\n410\n00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.555\n&gt;&gt; I was on Space Mountain I\ncouldn't help it.\n\n411\n00:23:12.555 --> 00:23:15.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's true, hanging upside down.\n\n412\n00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.480\nBut I mean it's one of those where it's\nbad enough that the phone's gone but\n\n413\n00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.170\nat least it's only the phone.\n\n414\n00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.845\nIf we have something like this enabled I\ncan then go into the management center and\n\n415\n00:23:24.845 --> 00:23:26.477\njust simply do a remote phone wipe.\n\n416\n00:23:26.477 --> 00:23:30.704\nIf I do that, that means the data will\nactually be lifted off of there without\n\n417\n00:23:30.704 --> 00:23:35.770\nthe person getting away with data, too,\nthat might be sensitive to our company.\n\n418\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:40.760\nSo that's something else that we can also\nget set up as we start to take a look.\n\n419\n00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.310\nThe great thing is it's still in the same\nlocation as everything else that we've\n\n420\n00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.480\nbeen talking about.\n\n421\n00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.726\nUnderneath a particular user here.\n\n422\n00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:53.745\nIf we go into the features, and we're\njust taking a look at this right here,\n\n423\n00:23:53.745 --> 00:23:58.543\nyou can see where it says\nMobile Device Mobile Devices here,\n\n424\n00:23:58.543 --> 00:24:01.102\nDisable Exchange ActiveSync.\n\n425\n00:24:01.102 --> 00:24:04.654\nIf you have people that are doing\nthe BYOD on your network,\n\n426\n00:24:04.654 --> 00:24:07.273\nyou wanna make sure that this is on, okay?\n\n427\n00:24:07.273 --> 00:24:11.500\nYou wanna make that this doesn't\nsay Enable at this point.\n\n428\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:16.330\nYou also want to make sure\nthat you have OWA on Devices\n\n429\n00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:21.270\nalso enabled if you want them to get\naccess to the email system as well, okay?\n\n430\n00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:25.780\nSo those are actually kind of key,\nin terms of the web UI,\n\n431\n00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.460\nthat you have access to,\nto be able to do this.\n\n432\n00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.220\nNow, on top of that,\nwhen you start getting into this,\n\n433\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.890\nI wanna make sure I'm actually\nin the right place here,\n\n434\n00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:41.010\nis essentially almost the same command\nthat we just ended up seeing, too.\n\n435\n00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.605\nNow, we're still working\nwith a CASMailbox.\n\n436\n00:24:43.605 --> 00:24:51.094\nIf I wanted to enable this feature\nusing the PowerShell here,\n\n437\n00:24:51.094 --> 00:24:57.575\ninstead of OWA Enabled,\nI could do ActiveSync here,\n\n438\n00:24:57.575 --> 00:25:02.183\nand I'm getting to the Enabled part,\n\n439\n00:25:02.183 --> 00:25:05.802\nif I can get there, Enabled.\n\n440\n00:25:05.802 --> 00:25:07.833\nAnd then I can change this one to False.\n\n441\n00:25:07.833 --> 00:25:12.725\nAnd if I do, that should mean that this\nlink right here changes to what, to False.\n\n442\n00:25:12.725 --> 00:25:14.966\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's go ahead and\n\n443\n00:25:14.966 --> 00:25:16.480\nsee if I can do that.\n\n444\n00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.060\nLet me see there.\n\n445\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.630\nNope, hopefully, there we go.\n\n446\n00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:27.632\nNow, if I run the Get-Mailbox,\nyou'll see where it's set up to False.\n\n447\n00:25:27.632 --> 00:25:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And that really does verify that.\n\n448\n00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.100\nLet me change it back to True,\ncuz I know somebody's actually using that.\n\n449\n00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.560\nSo [LAUGH] let me get that set back up.\n\n450\n00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.860\nI don't wanna mess around with somebody\nelse's Mailbox at this particular point.\n\n451\n00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.600\nSo you can go in there and be able to\nset that up and get that done as well.\n\n452\n00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.170\nNow, we also showed you,\nin the Security &amp; Compliance,\n\n453\n00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.110\nwhere you can get everything set up for\nyour mobile device manager.\n\n454\n00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.910\nThis is a longer process.\n\n455\n00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:55.740\nThis process, once it's all set up,\nit can take up to 24 hours before\n\n456\n00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.620\neverything is actually\nset up in the cloud.\n\n457\n00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.160\nSo it's not a feature that you can say,\nlet me just test this out for\n\n458\n00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.390\nan hour or two.\n\n459\n00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:07.166\nOnce you actually start setting it up and\nyou enter in the domain name that you\n\n460\n00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:11.305\nwant it to manage, at that point,\nyou're gonna see, it's gonna say,\n\n461\n00:26:11.305 --> 00:26:16.400\nhey, check back in a few hours, or check\nback in several hours to see if it's on.\n\n462\n00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.905\nNext thing that you'll end up going to is,\nonce you go back into that same place for\n\n463\n00:26:19.905 --> 00:26:23.890\nthe device management, it will either\nshow you a device, or it won't.\n\n464\n00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.660\nIt doesn't tell you that it's\nactually enabled or not.\n\n465\n00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.840\nSo don't go too far into that one.\n\n466\n00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.450\nBut just kind of be aware that you do\nhave that ability to do so, and then,\n\n467\n00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.920\nof course, enroll devices.\n\n468\n00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.490\nThe last little feature that\nwe want to talk about here\n\n469\n00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:42.870\nis gonna be pretty much talking about\ngetting the data loss prevention.\n\n470\n00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:47.110\nNow, on this one,\nwe did set this up completely\n\n471\n00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:51.200\ninside of the configuring Exchange,\nokay, when you see this.\n\n472\n00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.350\nBut the key here is making\nsure that you do understand\n\n473\n00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:00.500\nthat you have to be able to go in there\nand see where these features are gonna be.\n\n474\n00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.160\nSo let's show you that as the last one.\n\n475\n00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.500\nAnd if you wanted to take a look\nat the configuration side of this,\n\n476\n00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.890\njust make sure you go back and\nwatch the show on configuring Exchange and\n\n477\n00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.190\ndata loss, or data loss.\n\n478\n00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; On configuring Exchange Online, and\n\n479\n00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:20.010\nespecially the session on\ndata loss prevention here.\n\n480\n00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.920\nInside of the EAC,\nyou're gonna select compliance management.\n\n481\n00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.650\nAnd once you do that,\n\n482\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:30.330\nnotice that there's a big link right\nhere that says data loss prevention.\n\n483\n00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.889\nAnd it's here, again,\nthat they point you over to the Security &amp;\n\n484\n00:27:35.889 --> 00:27:39.520\nCompliance Center in SharePoint and\nExchange.\n\n485\n00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.499\nSo this is one of the areas where they're\nsaying, look, you can actually manage this\n\n486\n00:27:44.499 --> 00:27:47.749\nall in the Security &amp;\nCompliance Center if you want to,\n\n487\n00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:50.057\ninstead of just doing this right here.\n\n488\n00:27:50.057 --> 00:27:54.528\nI already created this policy\nthat we did from a show before.\n\n489\n00:27:54.528 --> 00:27:57.980\nIf I wanna create a new one,\nI have this ability to go in and\n\n490\n00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.670\ncreate one from a template, from a custom,\nand even a new custom policy.\n\n491\n00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:05.620\nWe did all of that on the actual show\nitself, where we showed you how to\n\n492\n00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.200\nconfigure one of these different\npolicies that are available to you.\n\n493\n00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.015\nThat of course means,\nlike everything else,\n\n494\n00:28:13.015 --> 00:28:13.742\nright-\n&gt;&gt; We're going to\n\n495\n00:28:13.742 --> 00:28:14.475\nthe PowerShell, aren't we?\n\n496\n00:28:14.475 --> 00:28:17.290\n&gt;&gt; You have to know\nthe PowerShell commands here.\n\n497\n00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:22.282\nSo as a reminder, if I start to\ndo something like this, okay,\n\n498\n00:28:22.282 --> 00:28:25.169\nI can now do a Get-Policy command.\n\n499\n00:28:28.247 --> 00:28:30.310\nNope, let's see.\n\n500\n00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.760\nWhat type of policy do I want?\n\n501\n00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.270\nLet me do a, is it DLP?\n\n502\n00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.870\nMaybe that's it, Get.\n\n503\n00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.190\nIf not,\nI'll just show you what the command.\n\n504\n00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.410\nYep, DlpCompliancePolicies.\n\n505\n00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:43.346\n&gt;&gt; So we've just asked for\nthe type of policy.\n\n506\n00:28:43.346 --> 00:28:43.940\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n507\n00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.555\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n508\n00:28:46.579 --> 00:28:49.073\n&gt;&gt; So in a moment, hopefully, it'll\nshow up an actual policy, there we go.\n\n509\n00:28:49.073 --> 00:28:49.621\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n510\n00:28:49.621 --> 00:28:53.498\n&gt;&gt; So there's the one with that exact\nname that I was showing you, hopefully.\n\n511\n00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:54.658\nLet me see where it went.\n\n512\n00:28:54.658 --> 00:28:58.420\nYep, DLP policy.\n\n513\n00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.495\nSo that's the actual one that's there.\n\n514\n00:29:00.495 --> 00:29:03.500\nTestWithNotifications, or\nyeah, no, that's right.\n\n515\n00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.990\nJust trying to make sure I was\nactually doing this right here.\n\n516\n00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.773\nBut that's what you would do.\n\n517\n00:29:06.773 --> 00:29:10.080\nYou'd actually be able to get that\npolicy and be able to take a look at it.\n\n518\n00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.340\nWe did configure one that I\nthink I did call exactly that.\n\n519\n00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.565\nSo I know it's actually set up,\n\n520\n00:29:15.565 --> 00:29:18.690\ncuz I did [LAUGH] actually configure\nthat one that's available.\n\n521\n00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:23.790\nFrom here, if you're gonna set a new one,\nit's a New-DlpPolicy.\n\n522\n00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:28.100\nAnd then you give it a name,\nlike test2, just for an example.\n\n523\n00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.960\nAnd that will create a new policy.\n\n524\n00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:39.490\nIf you want to remove it,\nnope, Remove-DlpPolicy.\n\n525\n00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:42.739\nAnd then give it the same name,\nor identity this time, sorry.\n\n526\n00:29:46.961 --> 00:29:53.161\nTest2, and that will also say, hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n527\n00:29:53.161 --> 00:29:54.257\nYes, I do.\n\n528\n00:29:54.257 --> 00:29:59.552\nAll of these, the majority, if not\nevery single command I just showed you,\n\n529\n00:29:59.552 --> 00:30:02.240\nwe go over in the configuration show.\n\n530\n00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:02.785\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n531\n00:30:02.785 --> 00:30:05.085\n&gt;&gt; So we're not just rushing through this.\n\n532\n00:30:05.085 --> 00:30:07.865\nIt is just trying to say,\nhere's an introduction.\n\n533\n00:30:07.865 --> 00:30:09.825\nThese are some of the considerations.\n\n534\n00:30:09.825 --> 00:30:15.440\nWhen planning for Exchange, make sure\nyou understand that that's a lot, right?\n\n535\n00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.530\nEvery single one of these,\n\n536\n00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.770\nwhether we're talking about creating\na data loss prevention policy, or\n\n537\n00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.710\nwe're trying to make sure we're\nusing ActiveSync on mobile devices.\n\n538\n00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.680\nOr we're trying to make sure that we're\nactually doing a litigation hold or\n\n539\n00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.740\na legal hold, as we call it,\nall of these, right?\n\n540\n00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.740\nThese are all considerations\nwhen planning for\n\n541\n00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.689\nExchange, as well as the archiving\nthat we've been doing.\n\n542\n00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.910\nAll that has to be considered.\n\n543\n00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.600\nIt's not something that you can go,\nI don't care about that.\n\n544\n00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.090\nIt's something you definitely have to,\n\n545\n00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.130\ndepending on the sensitivity of\nthe data inside of your networks.\n\n546\n00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.600\nSo don't bypass it just because you go,\nwe're never gonna use that.\n\n547\n00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.960\nMake sure you talk it out, and\nmake sure you plan it out.\n\n548\n00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.747\nBefore you enable all these features,\n\n549\n00:30:50.747 --> 00:30:54.492\nmake sure they're actually what\nyour network's actually gonna need.\n\n550\n00:30:54.492 --> 00:30:55.680\nAnd that's gonna be much better for\n\n551\n00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.270\nyou as you migrate all the way\nthrough that for Exchange.\n\n552\n00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.432\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well, this is Planning for\nExchange Online, part two.\n\n553\n00:31:02.432 --> 00:31:04.971\nThere was part one, and\nas Ronnie was saying,\n\n554\n00:31:04.971 --> 00:31:08.815\nyou need to see every episode of\nthe Enabling Office 365 Services,\n\n555\n00:31:08.815 --> 00:31:12.746\nbecause we cover lots of things that\nwe bring back and talk about again.\n\n556\n00:31:12.746 --> 00:31:13.941\nI'm your host, Zach

think it's exciting.\n\n13\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.863\n&gt;&gt; It's really one this topics that,\nas an IT administrator,\n\n14\n00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:40.890\nonce we're actually going to\ntake a look at Office 365.\n\n15\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.150\nYou're gonna really need to be\nfamiliar with some of these global\n\n16\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.360\nsettings here, right?\n\n17\n00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.940\nThe settings that really aren't\nper user or end user based.\n\n18\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.270\nThese are settings that we want to make\nsure that we understand, that must be\n\n19\n00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.260\nthere for our Skype for Business to work\nwell across the entire organization.\n\n20\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.618\nSo it's important as we start to set this\nup that we understand first what those\n\n21\n00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:04.485\nsettings are.\n\n22\n00:01:04.485 --> 00:01:09.157\nAnd then, of course, what we have to do to\ngo about making sure that they're on or\n\n23\n00:01:09.157 --> 00:01:11.840\noff or anything else that we have to do.\n\n24\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.460\nSo we're gonna be taking a look at\nmultiple topics during the show.\n\n25\n00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.650\nWe're probably gonna spend a little bit\nmore time here at the beginning, and\n\n26\n00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.920\nthen you'll probably see, we'll probably\nbreak this up into at least a Part Two.\n\n27\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.220\nAnd may even go into a Part Three,\nfor all I know.\n\n28\n00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.030\nBut overall though,\n\n29\n00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.630\nthat is what we're actually going\nto begin by taking a look at.\n\n30\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.870\nSo, when we start talking about\nthe idea of setting up for what we call\n\n31\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.430\nexternal access, or enabling external\naccess, this is kind of a key point.\n\n32\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.074\nWhen you get your Office\n365 subscriptions,\n\n33\n00:01:41.074 --> 00:01:45.524\neverybody that has access to the Office\n365 subscription that has the Skype for\n\n34\n00:01:45.524 --> 00:01:47.345\nBusiness a part of that, right?\n\n35\n00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:49.637\nMake sure you go in and\nyou check your subscription plan,\n\n36\n00:01:49.637 --> 00:01:51.250\nsee if that's happening.\n\n37\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.960\nThey can communicate all day long, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.026\nThey will have the client\non their computers, and\n\n39\n00:01:57.026 --> 00:02:00.314\nthey can use that to actually build and\ncommunicate.\n\n40\n00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:05.180\nWorks great and you'll be very happy\nwith the result that you'll get.\n\n41\n00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.750\nBut there are going to be times,\n\n42\n00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.550\nof course, that you'll need to\ncommunicate outside of your organization.\n\n43\n00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.620\nAnd you've got options that you\nhave available there to do this.\n\n44\n00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.560\nSo for example, Zack, what can end up\nhappening is that you go, all right,\n\n45\n00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.610\nI'm gonna use Skype for\nBusiness, but really just for\n\n46\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.090\nthe instant messaging and\ninternal communications.\n\n47\n00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.380\nThen you can go out and say, hey,\nI wanna talk to another company about\n\n48\n00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.760\nimplementing a phone system for\nus in the business.\n\n49\n00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.393\nAnd they can, of course, help you and\n\n50\n00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:37.959\nyou can set up different phone\nsystems to make that happen.\n\n51\n00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.539\nYou can even go to your telephone company\nand say, here is what we actually need,\n\n52\n00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.860\nand they can help you set\nthat up if you want to.\n\n53\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.360\nSo that is an option for you.\n\n54\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.160\nBut when something like that happens,\n\n55\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.120\nit also means that they might have\nto bring in some extra equipment.\n\n56\n00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.450\nBecause you're probably hosting\nyour own external or internal\n\n57\n00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.950\ntype of phone switch ,and making sure\nthat all those features are up there and\n\n58\n00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.630\navailable, but you really don't have to.\n\n59\n00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.933\nIf you actually start to enable Skype for\n\n60\n00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:05.318\nBusiness to do that for you,\nby enabling external access,\n\n61\n00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:09.534\nit really takes kind of some of the\nheadache away from you having to worry.\n\n62\n00:03:09.534 --> 00:03:11.050\nIs it something here?\n\n63\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.832\nWell, it's always gonna be in the cloud.\n\n64\n00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:14.840\nAnd in Skype for business,\na lot of it is, for\n\n65\n00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.160\nus, just knowing what the services are.\n\n66\n00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.010\nThey've already figured\nout how it actually works.\n\n67\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.051\nYou don't have to have another technician\nthat comes out every once in a while,\n\n68\n00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:25.715\nyou have a one place shop.\n\n69\n00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:28.807\nBut with Skype for Business the solution,\nat least at that part,\n\n70\n00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:31.574\nis really just us saying,\nall right, how do we enable it?\n\n71\n00:03:31.574 --> 00:03:32.784\nHow do we get it done?\n\n72\n00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:34.690\nHow do we actually make that happen?\n\n73\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.530\nSo that's what we really\nwant to think about, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.650\nNow, when it comes down to external users,\nwho are we talking about?\n\n75\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.610\nWell, anybody outside of your\norganization first, right?\n\n76\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.250\nSo as long as people are outside of your\norganization and you want to be able to\n\n77\n00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.210\ncommunicate with them outside, or you want\nthem to communicate with you as well.\n\n78\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.590\nYou're gonna need to enable for\nexternal access.\n\n79\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.435\nIt could also be that,\ninside of your Office 365 organization,\n\n80\n00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:05.780\nthat you are hosting for\nmultiple domains as well.\n\n81\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.860\nWhen you're doing that,\n\n82\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.340\nyou also need to enable that for\nthe external access as well.\n\n83\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.221\nEven between domains that are internal,\nyou'll need to enable the external access.\n\n84\n00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:20.797\nAnd, of course, if you want your\nusers internally to use Skype for\n\n85\n00:04:20.797 --> 00:04:24.160\nBusiness to contact\noutside the organization.\n\n86\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.010\nIn other words you go, I don't really want\nanother system, I don't want to have to\n\n87\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.270\npay another gigantic amount of money to\nimplement a true PBX in my network here.\n\n88\n00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.704\nThen, yes, using Skype for Business,\nenabling the external access,\n\n89\n00:04:38.704 --> 00:04:42.361\nwill now allow you to use Skype to\nreally allow you to reach out and\n\n90\n00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:44.961\nconnect even outside of your organization.\n\n91\n00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:49.738\nSo all of that is part of the process in\nwhat we're actually going to be talking\n\n92\n00:04:49.738 --> 00:04:50.670\nabout.\n\n93\n00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.297\nAnd, of course, showing you how to\nverify or make sure that it's on and\n\n94\n00:04:54.297 --> 00:04:55.091\nenabled here.\n\n95\n00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:58.924\nSo that is what we're actually\ngonna take a look at now, and\n\n96\n00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:03.373\nlike everything else there are some\ncomplexities to this that don't\n\n97\n00:05:03.373 --> 00:05:07.930\nalways have to do just directly\nwith Skype for Business, too.\n\n98\n00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.150\nSo let's start off there, and then we'll\ntalk about some of the other things that\n\n99\n00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.730\nwe may have to think about and\nchoose as well.\n\n100\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:22.442\nSo here on my computer I'm going to\nget logged into the Office 365 domain.\n\n101\n00:05:22.442 --> 00:05:24.858\nLet me see if I can type this password in.\n\n102\n00:05:28.243 --> 00:05:29.160\n&gt;&gt; The super secret password.\n\n103\n00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.930\n&gt;&gt; The super secret password that\nI can remember sometimes, but\n\n104\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:33.970\nnot all the time here.\n\n105\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.690\nAnd once I'm inside,\n\n106\n00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.050\nI need to get into the Skype for Business\nAdmin Portal is where I need to go.\n\n107\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.042\nSo I'm going to click on the Admin tile,\nand that will lead me, of course,\n\n108\n00:05:46.042 --> 00:05:48.995\nto the Office 365 Admin Center, maybe.\n\n109\n00:05:48.995 --> 00:05:49.703\nTry it again, there we go.\n\n110\n00:05:51.523 --> 00:05:55.469\nOnce we're actually in the Admin Center,\nover on the lower left-hand corner\n\n111\n00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.714\nI should also find the Admin icon\nin that navigation bar as well.\n\n112\n00:05:58.714 --> 00:06:04.400\nThings going a little bit slow this\nafternoon for Office 365 here.\n\n113\n00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.040\nJust kind of slowly but\nsurely creeping in.\n\n114\n00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.780\nSo I'm gonna scroll down to the bottom.\n\n115\n00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.300\nLook for, of course, the Admin icon,\nselect Skype for Business.\n\n116\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.037\nSo from the Web UI standpoint\nit's not really difficult,\n\n117\n00:06:21.037 --> 00:06:24.420\nbut it is something that, if you think\nthat you're just preparing for the exam.\n\n118\n00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.170\nThat you go,\nI'll figure it out on the exam,\n\n119\n00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.650\nit's not gonna help you,\nit is buried a bit in here.\n\n120\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.840\nSo even if you get to this\npoint where you have Skype for\n\n121\n00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.380\nBusiness, notice on the left-hand\nside as it's populating in.\n\n122\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.910\nThere's still a lot of options going\non over here on the left-hand side\n\n123\n00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.900\nthat you have to actually\nbe able to get set up.\n\n124\n00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.875\nNow, once we're actually here,\nwe now can go into organization,\n\n125\n00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.070\nis where we want to go.\n\n126\n00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.090\nAnd then, inside of organization,\n\n127\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.525\nit's gonna be here under\nthe external communications.\n\n128\n00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:02.647\nAnd in the external communications,\njust like it sounds to set up for\n\n129\n00:07:02.647 --> 00:07:07.342\nexternal users connecting in, there's\ngonna be a couple of different things\n\n130\n00:07:07.342 --> 00:07:11.200\nthat we really want to pay attention\nhere as we start to see this.\n\n131\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.763\nSo let me zoom in just a little bit so\nthat you can see it better.\n\n132\n00:07:14.763 --> 00:07:18.334\nYou can control access to Skype for\nBusiness users and\n\n133\n00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:21.570\nother organizations in one of two ways.\n\n134\n00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.250\nYou can block specific domains, but\nallow access to everything else.\n\n135\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.760\nOr allow specific domains, but\nblock access to everyone else.\n\n136\n00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.540\nAnd we had talked about this concept in\nearlier episodes, Zack, you and I did.\n\n137\n00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.410\nWe talked about black listing and\nwhite listing.\n\n138\n00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.280\nIt's essentially saying you need to\npick which one you're going to chose.\n\n139\n00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.590\nSo that is up to you on how\nyou chose to set that up.\n\n140\n00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.320\nNow, you might be saying,\nwell Ronnie, which one's best?\n\n141\n00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.952\nIt's really up to your organization's\nsecurity policy at that point,\n\n142\n00:07:49.952 --> 00:07:51.388\nof how you chose to do stuff.\n\n143\n00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:54.672\nSo I wish I could tell you, this is\nthe way that you should set it up, and\n\n144\n00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:56.582\nthis is the only way you should set it up.\n\n145\n00:07:56.582 --> 00:08:00.296\nBut I might actually be violating\nyour company's security policy.\n\n146\n00:08:00.296 --> 00:08:05.820\nSo make sure you find out from those\nguys which one that you should.\n\n147\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.330\nFor me, if I were doing it and\nI was the one to set it up,\n\n148\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.440\nI would say whitelisting is the way to go.\n\n149\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.590\nIn other words, allow who I want to\nallow in but block everybody else.\n\n150\n00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.100\nBut you might not be able to do that.\n\n151\n00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.100\nAnd what I mean by that is let's say,\nfor an example,\n\n152\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.950\nthat you have a sales team, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.730\nThe idea of blocking everybody but\nwho you want to allow access to,\n\n154\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.740\nnow you're kind of limiting\nyour scope of business, right?\n\n155\n00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.470\nWhere you go, yeah,\nI'm only gonna allow these users.\n\n156\n00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.370\nWell, that'd be silly if I want people\nto buy, I don't really care who buys,\n\n157\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.300\nI just people to buy from me.\n\n158\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.670\nSo, you do have to pay attention to\nwhat you're really trying to do.\n\n159\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:48.260\nSo, it's not a, I wish I could say\nhere it is, simple turn key solution.\n\n160\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.450\nDo it my way, and it'll work every time.\n\n161\n00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.600\nI can't do that, I wish I could say\nthat I knew all the answers on that one.\n\n162\n00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.940\nBut on this one here,\nthat's what you'll choose.\n\n163\n00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:03.290\nNow, notice that you have, once you choose\nthat, what are you going to do here?\n\n164\n00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.770\nExcept for blocked domains, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:12.400\nOr on only for allowed domains here.\n\n166\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.410\nSo external access only for\nallowed domains,\n\n167\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:20.480\nthat is by far the most restrictive\nthat we have available to, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.600\nThen, except for blocked domains,\nmeans allow everybody else except for\n\n169\n00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.890\nthe ones I blocked.\n\n170\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.410\nThat to me sounds more natural for\na company that may have a sales team.\n\n171\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:34.410\nThat goes, no don't block somebody that's\ncalling me to buy something from me,\n\n172\n00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.351\nthat would be insane [LAUGH].\n\n173\n00:09:35.351 --> 00:09:37.850\n&gt;&gt; Not a good thing.\n&gt;&gt; That's definitely not a good thing\n\n174\n00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.160\nwhen we start doing that.\n\n175\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.686\nSo here, we definitely want to pay\nattention and then probably the one you\n\n176\n00:09:43.686 --> 00:09:47.410\ndon't want to do,\nwhich is to just let it be completely off.\n\n177\n00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.034\nNow, is a possible?\n\n178\n00:09:49.034 --> 00:09:53.762\nYes, you may chose this particular option\nand go, I'm not gonna worry about blocking\n\n179\n00:09:53.762 --> 00:09:57.262\nanything, I'm not gonna worry\nabout whitelisting anything,\n\n180\n00:09:57.262 --> 00:10:00.602\nI'm just gonna allow it to do\nwhat I want it to do here, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:00.602 --> 00:10:04.469\nSo that does give us this ability to do so\nif we choose that.\n\n182\n00:10:04.469 --> 00:10:08.990\nNow, once we select which one\nwe're going to do, right?\n\n183\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.380\nSo if I choose the more restrictive\nof the two just as an example here,\n\n184\n00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.990\nthen I'm going to skip over this one for\na moment here.\n\n185\n00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.920\nBecause it is a little bit weird and\nI'll come back to that,\n\n186\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.970\nbecause if not I'll go\non a sidetrack Zach.\n\n187\n00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.340\nDon't let me do that too much or\n\n188\n00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.620\nwe'll really be heading out\nto the weeds at times here.\n\n189\n00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:32.080\nBut, this first one up here just says,\nall right, here's what we wanna do.\n\n190\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.478\nAnd then the way that you can figure\nthat option is you come down here, okay?\n\n191\n00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.700\nWe're not really addressing the thing\nright in the middle, which is strange.\n\n192\n00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.610\nI don't know why they chose\nto do this because this is\n\n193\n00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.940\nactually a separate option.\n\n194\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.900\nAnd it really is.\n\n195\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.800\nSo, to me, it's a little bit\nstrange why they would do that.\n\n196\n00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.490\nLogically, for me, I would have\nput these two together, right?\n\n197\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.640\nExternal access blocked or\nallowed domains.\n\n198\n00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.717\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense.\n\n199\n00:10:55.717 --> 00:10:58.607\n&gt;&gt; Then you click + here,\nand it's here that\n\n200\n00:10:58.607 --> 00:11:03.201\nyou enter the domain name that you\nwant to add in to allow for, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:05.910\nIf you select that on,\nit's the one that you're gonna block.\n\n202\n00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.860\nSo, it makes sense, logically,\nwe understand that.\n\n203\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.540\nSo, those are some of the options\nthat you do have available.\n\n204\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.580\nThis one right here in the middle, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.330\nThis is a little bit more unusual for\nus where what we're trying to do here is\n\n206\n00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:26.990\nwe're trying to manage for just regular\nSkype consumer connectivity, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.347\nNow, what we mean by that,\n\n208\n00:11:28.347 --> 00:11:32.010\nnotice it says public instant\nmessaging connectivity here.\n\n209\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.210\nLet people use Skype for\n\n210\n00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:38.370\nBusiness to communicate with Skype\nusers outside of your organization.\n\n211\n00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.770\nNow, notice the way that it\nactually words it right here, Zach.\n\n212\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.340\nAnd this is where we actually do\nsee a couple of things, right?\n\n213\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:52.430\nNotice the way it words it over here,\nSkype for Business and then Skype users.\n\n214\n00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.920\nNotice this part doesn't say Skype for\nBusiness users, or\n\n215\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.800\nother Skype for\nBusiness organizations or people.\n\n216\n00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.130\nAnd what they're really\ntalking about is that, hey,\n\n217\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:06.210\nthere are people that are not part of\na Skype for Business organization.\n\n218\n00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.500\nAnd they still want to\ncommunicate with you using Skype.\n\n219\n00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.220\nWell, if you have this one unchecked,\nand mine was checked by default.\n\n220\n00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.770\nBut if you have this unchecked here, that\nmeans that those people that are running\n\n221\n00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:25.630\nSkype just on their regular home computer,\nstand alone Skype by themselves,\n\n222\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.950\nthey won't be able to communicate\nwith your Skype for Business.\n\n223\n00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:33.070\nSo that is a good thing possibly.\n\n224\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:34.990\nIt's a bad thing as well.\n\n225\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.180\nIt depends on what your\norganization is doing.\n\n226\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.930\nThis would be terrible for\n\n227\n00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.690\nthat same scenario that I was\njust talking about, Zach.\n\n228\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:47.945\nIf I have sales people and\nI put on whatever I've sent out,\n\n229\n00:12:47.945 --> 00:12:50.750\nan email or\nwhatever communication I send out.\n\n230\n00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.510\nYou can contact us on Skype,\nand I have it blocked.\n\n231\n00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.230\nWell, that would be silly, right?\n\n232\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.120\nThey would try to get connected and\nthere it is, they're not able to connect.\n\n233\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.550\nAnd there's something I put out there\non whatever promotional materials that\n\n234\n00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.620\nyou can use Skype to connect to us.\n\n235\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.420\nAnd it doesn't allow that.\n\n236\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.270\nSo this is where it is\na simple checkbox for\n\n237\n00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:15.420\nus, of course, to just be able to do this.\n\n238\n00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.380\nSo notice that these three options here,\nokay, it seems logical\n\n239\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:25.300\nenough that we would want to do this,\nand we would want to configure this.\n\n240\n00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.930\nAnd that would help us to mange the way\nthat domains access our Skype for\n\n241\n00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.700\nBusiness or our network as well and\nour communicating for\n\n242\n00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.020\nexternal access coming in.\n\n243\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.060\nAnd then once we see this,\nit does, it makes sense.\n\n244\n00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.230\nIt always makes sense until we\nhave to see the PowerShell.\n\n245\n00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.754\nAnd I really mean that, Zach.\n\n246\n00:13:44.754 --> 00:13:50.380\nAt this particular point, once you go,\nall right, I can get this into my head.\n\n247\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.598\nThat, I can understand.\n\n248\n00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:58.091\nIf there is a particular domain that I\nknow that's just constantly spamming me,\n\n249\n00:13:58.091 --> 00:14:02.132\nor they're just sending false\ntelecommunications to me,\n\n250\n00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:04.423\nthe annoying types of cold call.\n\n251\n00:14:04.423 --> 00:14:07.398\nI don't wanna say that, I shouldn't\nsay that, it's a business, right?\n\n252\n00:14:07.398 --> 00:14:13.638\nJust unsolicited, annoying message,\nI should say, right?\n\n253\n00:14:13.638 --> 00:14:17.298\nI might go, all right, I'm getting\nthis from this domain all the time,\n\n254\n00:14:17.298 --> 00:14:18.259\nit's happening so\n\n255\n00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:21.876\noften, then I might block that domain\nsounds like a really good thing.\n\n256\n00:14:21.876 --> 00:14:26.148\nBut at the same time,\nonce you get all that set up it works but\n\n257\n00:14:26.148 --> 00:14:30.880\nit does take a bit of time before\nanything actually come in.\n\n258\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.754\nAnd what I mean by that is that\nonce you make these settings and\n\n259\n00:14:33.754 --> 00:14:35.250\nthese changes like this.\n\n260\n00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.290\nAnd this is gonna be true regardless of\nwhether you're doing it in the web UI or\n\n261\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.270\nwhether you're doing this\ninside of the PowerShell.\n\n262\n00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.820\nIt may take up to, let me make sure I'm\ntelling you right, you may have to wait up\n\n263\n00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:54.400\nto 24 hours before these settings take\neffect, and there's a reason behind that.\n\n264\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.826\nWhen we start using domains,\nwell, it's not asking us for\n\n265\n00:14:58.826 --> 00:15:03.881\nhow we actually connect to different\nmachines out on the Internet.\n\n266\n00:15:03.881 --> 00:15:06.523\nIt's saying,\nthere's a name resolution, right?\n\n267\n00:15:06.523 --> 00:15:11.459\nIf I put ITPro.TV as a domain\nto be blocked here, well,\n\n268\n00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:18.080\nthat has to populate out through\nthe Internet's DNS infrastructure.\n\n269\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.390\nSaying, yeah, at some point here\nwe're gonna have to block that.\n\n270\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:25.030\nSo it has to resolve the name to an IP\naddress, has to do all that stuff.\n\n271\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.100\nIt's gotta actually be able to\nmatch that and make that happen.\n\n272\n00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.090\nSo it takes a bit of time before\nsomething like this ends up working.\n\n273\n00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.698\nSo just kinda realize it\nmay take up to 24 hours.\n\n274\n00:15:34.698 --> 00:15:38.930\nAnd we're gonna see something else in\njust a little bit of time as well,\n\n275\n00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.720\nmaybe even next episode where\nwe'll see other settings.\n\n276\n00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.320\nAnd this actually is kind of a good thing\ncuz I don't think I've even mentioned this\n\n277\n00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.671\nin an episode yet even though we've\ndone plenty of episodes on Office 365.\n\n278\n00:15:50.671 --> 00:15:55.671\nCloud settings are not always, and\nI'm not gonna say every single one, but\n\n279\n00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:58.733\nThey're not always gonna be instantaneous.\n\n280\n00:15:58.733 --> 00:16:02.680\nSome of them may just take 10 minutes or\n15 minutes.\n\n281\n00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.858\nSome of them may take a full 24 hours\njust like what we're seeing here.\n\n282\n00:16:06.858 --> 00:16:08.860\nSome of them may just take several hours,\n\n283\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.220\nyou just don't know but that's because\nthat cloud infrastructure even for\n\n284\n00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.090\nyour one organization is setup across\nmultiple different data centers.\n\n285\n00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.030\nThey don't want you to actually\ngo to one data center somewhere,\n\n286\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.170\nwhere those settings are different\nthan the one that you have,\n\n287\n00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.880\nthat you just set up where you are.\n\n288\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.690\nThey want all that stuff\nto replicate out so\n\n289\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.550\nthat everybody has the same\nexperience in connecting in.\n\n290\n00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.440\nWhere we don't want somebody to go\nI'm gonna connect over here and\n\n291\n00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.100\nmaybe I can bypass the setting\nthat got over here.\n\n292\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.380\nSo you've got to wait for\ntime and for this stuff to happen.\n\n293\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:44.320\nSo if you're setting something like this\nup, make sure that you don't do this\n\n294\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.390\nduring a regular business day expecting\nit's gonna happen immediately.\n\n295\n00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.370\nA great time,\nI wont say a great time, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.992\nA better time to do this,\nright, is over night.\n\n297\n00:16:54.992 --> 00:16:58.583\nOr something that nobody likes to do in\nIT which is to actually put a brand new\n\n298\n00:16:58.583 --> 00:17:02.880\nsetting on a Friday, cuz nobody wants to\ncome in over the weekend to fix anything.\n\n299\n00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.550\nBut that's prior better time for\nus to actually do something like this\n\n300\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.990\nwhere we can set it up and\nthen Monday when we come into work, or\n\n301\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.540\nwhatever your first day of business\nis as you come back and work.\n\n302\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.980\nThis setting has now taken effect and\n\n303\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.830\nit didn't really cause any downtime\nin my business to make it happen.\n\n304\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.720\nSo I'm probably of and\ngood if I do something like this.\n\n305\n00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.050\nSo it's not always possible that you're\ngonna get it exactly in 24 hours but\n\n306\n00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.090\nit is close.\n\n307\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.970\nThe recommendation here though, is if\nyour settings don't take place after that\n\n308\n00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:39.160\n24 hour period, make sure you call them so\nthey can check what might have happened.\n\n309\n00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.360\nSometimes it is something that Microsoft\nactually manually has to go in and\n\n310\n00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.400\ngo, here it is Ronnie,\nput a check mark here.\n\n311\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.080\nAnd it might actually be something\nphysical that they have to change.\n\n312\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.880\nI'm not saying for\nthis one in particular, but\n\n313\n00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.240\nthere are times when 24 hour period,\nthat's to you and\n\n314\n00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.584\nme, I mean that's a ton of time in\nthe internet world of things to happen.\n\n315\n00:17:59.584 --> 00:18:03.988\nBut you can guess that it might\ntake more than just replication and\n\n316\n00:18:03.988 --> 00:18:05.960\nstuff that goes out.\n\n317\n00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.900\nSo, that's what we have\nto actually be aware of.\n\n318\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.660\nSo now that I've talked about that,\nand that you understand that,\n\n319\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.990\nlet's take a look at how confusing\nthis can actually be when we get\n\n320\n00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.950\ninto the realm of PowerShell is what\nwe actually have to talk about here.\n\n321\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.577\nSo let's go ahead and\nmake sure that we see that as well.\n\n322\n00:18:23.577 --> 00:18:26.835\nI'm gonna bring up my PowerShell and\nof course,\n\n323\n00:18:26.835 --> 00:18:29.859\nI want to make sure that\nI am still connected.\n\n324\n00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:30.598\n&gt;&gt; As always.\n\n325\n00:18:30.598 --> 00:18:35.001\n&gt;&gt; Cuz this is really bad if you try and\ntype these commands, and well,\n\n326\n00:18:35.001 --> 00:18:37.250\nmaybe, there we go.\n\n327\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.960\nMine is a little bit sluggish today.\n\n328\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.120\nAll right, so here we are.\n\n329\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.940\nWe are connected,\nit's opened, it's available.\n\n330\n00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.570\nThat is exactly what I\nwant to make sure of.\n\n331\n00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.340\nI am now connected to the Skype for\nBusiness Online so\n\n332\n00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.440\nthat I can send commands, and\nit actually happens up there.\n\n333\n00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.490\nWhen we start to do this here, okay,\nand we want to manage domains.\n\n334\n00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:03.340\nWhat we want to do is, let's say for an\nexample, we want to create an allowed list\n\n335\n00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.690\nwhich really, essentially,\nblocks everything else.\n\n336\n00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.400\nSo this is just an example that\nyou can actually see and follow.\n\n337\n00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.360\nNow when we do this, right, we're gonna\ncreate a couple of different variables for\n\n338\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.240\nus to help us out is what we're gonna do.\n\n339\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:22.590\nSo the first one is, maybe, I'm gonna\ncreate a variable called Domain1.\n\n340\n00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.110\nI'm just gonna create a domain\nthat I'm gonna list behind here.\n\n341\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:31.537\nAnd when I do this, I'm gonna tell it,\n\n342\n00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:38.118\nI'm gonna create a New-CsEdgeDomainPattern\n\n343\n00:19:38.118 --> 00:19:43.722\n-Domain, if the n never comes in.\n\n344\n00:19:43.722 --> 00:19:47.755\nAnd we're gonna do this for\nitpro.tv just as an example.\n\n345\n00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:54.370\nWell, I just pressed Enter, and in\na moment, hopefully, it'll take it here.\n\n346\n00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.336\nIt is, like I said,\na little bit sluggish today.\n\n347\n00:19:57.336 --> 00:20:00.094\nThen I'm gonna create another one,\nI'm just gonna hit the up arrow so\n\n348\n00:20:00.094 --> 00:20:01.561\nI don't have to type in everything.\n\n349\n00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:04.986\nUse my left arrow and\nI'm gonna call this one Domain2.\n\n350\n00:20:06.784 --> 00:20:14.625\nAnd then I'm gonna add\nin the itprotvdemo.com.\n\n351\n00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:16.905\nNow I don't worry about using these two,\n\n352\n00:20:16.905 --> 00:20:21.200\nbecause I know that these are domains\nthat we at ITProTV actually own.\n\n353\n00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.836\nSo this one of course is our actual real\ndomain, then this one itprotvdemo.net and\n\n354\n00:20:26.836 --> 00:20:29.090\n.com, these are the ones that\nwe actually own and we use for\n\n355\n00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.780\nour shows a lot of times too.\n\n356\n00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.830\nSo I'm actually creating both of these and\nstoring them in these variables.\n\n357\n00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.405\nSo if I type in this name,\n\n358\n00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:39.840\nit's essentially gonna run these commands\nis what its going to do, all right?\n\n359\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.060\nNow let me see, make sure I\nactually get that one in there.\n\n360\n00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:51.300\nNow, once I do that I want to create\na brand new list as well, okay?\n\n361\n00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:56.170\nNow, when I do something like this,\nI am gonna create a third variable\n\n362\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.730\nthat's actually going to\ninclude these two in there.\n\n363\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.302\nSo on this one, I'm gonna do a $ and\n\n364\n00:21:03.302 --> 00:21:09.020\nI'll just simply call it Allowed,\nDomainList.\n\n365\n00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.590\nNow, you don't have to actually\ndo something this long.\n\n366\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.450\nI'm trying to do it for\nthe sake of the example, so\n\n367\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.020\nthat we understand what I'm creating here.\n\n368\n00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.218\nSo now I'm gonna do an equal sign.\n\n369\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:27.456\nAnd this one should be New-CsEdgeAllowList\n\n370\n00:21:27.456 --> 00:21:31.557\nis what this one should be.\n\n371\n00:21:33.741 --> 00:21:37.910\nAll right,\nnow let's kinda make sure, okay?\n\n372\n00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.540\nNotice, it's really two\ncommands right now.\n\n373\n00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.020\nAnd I'm emphasizing them for\n\n374\n00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.510\na reason, so make sure you\nnote what these commands are.\n\n375\n00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.500\nIt's the ones in the yellow, right?\n\n376\n00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.000\nIf I want to go ahead and start saying,\nhey, I'm gonna create a list here,\n\n377\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.225\nI'm gonna do this,\nI'm gonna create a domain pattern, and\n\n378\n00:21:54.225 --> 00:21:58.770\nthen I'm gonna create a new\nAllowList is what I'm going to do.\n\n379\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.700\nNow, once I do that, AllowList,\nlet me scroll over here,\n\n380\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:08.326\nI don't wanna get it too far back but\nI do have to be able to type it in here.\n\n381\n00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:13.220\nThen, AllowDomain.\n\n382\n00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:18.975\nAnd it is here,\nI'm gonna type in $Domain1, And\n\n383\n00:22:18.975 --> 00:22:21.865\nthen a comma-\n&gt;&gt; $Domain2.\n\n384\n00:22:21.865 --> 00:22:24.940\n&gt;&gt; And $Domain2, all right?\n\n385\n00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.139\nSo that should, If I press Enter,\n\n386\n00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:33.310\ngive me a moment, and\nthat should actually accept it for us.\n\n387\n00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.912\nSo what we have now,\nis that we're saying hey,\n\n388\n00:22:37.912 --> 00:22:45.058\nwe're gonna create a new domain list,\nitpro.tv, itprotvdemo.com.\n\n389\n00:22:45.058 --> 00:22:47.472\nAnd now we're gonna create this list and\n\n390\n00:22:47.472 --> 00:22:52.310\nthis is the AllowedDomains that\nwill essentially be on that list.\n\n391\n00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:56.080\nAll right, so\nnow that I've got the list created,\n\n392\n00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.860\nI now need to apply that list\ninto Skype for Business.\n\n393\n00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.720\nRemember, Zach, a few episodes ago now,\n\n394\n00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.100\nwe've been doing several\nof these episodes, right?\n\n395\n00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.380\nA few episodes ago,\n\n396\n00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:13.540\nI told you that this is not intuitive in\nthe way that everything is written out.\n\n397\n00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.210\nSo you would think that at some point,\nthey would change this to Skype for\n\n398\n00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.480\nBusiness something.\n\n399\n00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.030\nAnd they still haven't.\n\n400\n00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.390\nSo now if I want to set this,\n\n401\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:26.710\nI need to actually use the word Set,\nwhich is kind of key here.\n\n402\n00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:32.330\nThen -CsTenant, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.685\nSo CsTenant, what's CsTenant,\nI don't know, I really don't know.\n\n404\n00:23:35.685 --> 00:23:39.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; CsTenantFederation, my gosh,\n\n405\n00:23:39.725 --> 00:23:41.483\nConfiguration.\n\n406\n00:23:41.483 --> 00:23:46.490\nNow that is a long command,\nlook at the length of that thing.\n\n407\n00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.363\nSo now I'm gonna actually set this up.\n\n408\n00:23:48.363 --> 00:23:52.552\nSo here it is,\nCsTenantFederationConfiguration,\n\n409\n00:23:52.552 --> 00:23:56.188\nthen I'm gonna do a dash and\nthe option I want.\n\n410\n00:23:56.188 --> 00:24:00.755\nIs gonna be called allow,\n\n411\n00:24:00.755 --> 00:24:05.340\noops, AllowedDomains.\n\n412\n00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.689\nNow, in that AllowedDomains,\nwhat I'm gonna call them is the actual\n\n413\n00:24:09.689 --> 00:24:15.960\nvariable, That I already created.\n\n414\n00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.490\nSo this is last command here is\nwhat actually is going to run and\n\n415\n00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:27.780\nset this up for my particular connection,\nwhich I made up here at the very top.\n\n416\n00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:32.130\nSo I'm not running this for anybody else's\ndomain, I'm only running it for mine.\n\n417\n00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.110\nAnd hopefully I pressed Enter there,\nbut I don't know for sure.\n\n418\n00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:42.290\nLet me try it again And let's see here.\n\n419\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.680\nSometimes I don't know if actually,\nnope, I didn't, let me see.\n\n420\n00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:52.100\nAllowDomainList here.\n\n421\n00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.120\nThere we go.\n\n422\n00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.230\nSometimes I think I press Enter,\nand it doesn't,\n\n423\n00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.350\nbut it's actually blinking over here,\nthere we go.\n\n424\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.178\nSo now we've actually set\nthis particular setting up.\n\n425\n00:25:02.178 --> 00:25:04.190\nThe problem that I have is simple, Zach,\n\n426\n00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.560\nit's what I told you\nat the very beginning.\n\n427\n00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.260\nIt may take up to 24 hours before all\nthose settings get set into place.\n\n428\n00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.330\nSo, I can't even run a PowerShell command.\n\n429\n00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:18.760\nI can't even go into the GUI and go, hey,\nlook at this, it actually shows you this.\n\n430\n00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.450\nSo I can take quite a bit of\ntime before this shows up\n\n431\n00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.180\nwhen we start to see\ninformation like this.\n\n432\n00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.970\nSo, it's something that you\ncan't be overly anxious about.\n\n433\n00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.920\nAnd that is one of the more frustrating\nthings about working in the Cloud if you\n\n434\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.000\nhaven't been working in the Cloud before.\n\n435\n00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.870\nIf you're working around Cloud\nadministrators and go, just leave it set,\n\n436\n00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.070\nit's gonna work,\nit's gonna end up happening.\n\n437\n00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.730\nBut just kinda realize, it's not\nsomething you can be in a hurry about.\n\n438\n00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.140\nThat's why we recommend planning\nsomething like this out.\n\n439\n00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:52.270\nDon't just go, I'm gonna turn it on and\nit'll be ready in a few minutes.\n\n440\n00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:53.870\nIt's not gonna be ready in a few minutes.\n\n441\n00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:58.150\nSometimes, as you start to set this up,\nit's not gonna do that.\n\n442\n00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.390\nNow, we have one more setting,\n\n443\n00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.340\nthough, that we need to\nlearn inside of PowerShell.\n\n444\n00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.540\nAnd the great thing is I've only got just\na few minutes left for this episode.\n\n445\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.120\nRemember this one here, okay?\n\n446\n00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.630\nSo remember this, Zach?\n\n447\n00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.890\nI was talking about this,\npublic IM connectivity, and\n\n448\n00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.110\nwe talked about what this is about here.\n\n449\n00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.260\nWell, of course that means that\nwe can also do this inside of\n\n450\n00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.330\nPowerShell as well to get this one set up.\n\n451\n00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.268\nIt's kind of running just\nabout the same command here.\n\n452\n00:26:26.268 --> 00:26:32.281\nSet-CsTenant.\n\n453\n00:26:32.281 --> 00:26:35.337\nI don't know why that's so\nhard for me to spell, but it is.\n\n454\n00:26:35.337 --> 00:26:39.705\nTenant Configuration and\n\n455\n00:26:39.705 --> 00:26:44.077\nthen AllowPublicUsers.\n\n456\n00:26:47.573 --> 00:26:50.980\nAnd then I can set this to true or false.\n\n457\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.130\nSo I'm gonna set it to True.\n\n458\n00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.149\nNow it was already checked by default.\n\n459\n00:26:55.230 --> 00:27:01.840\nNow let me make sure that we kind\nof zoom in here, for just a moment.\n\n460\n00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.820\nNow, this is not exactly something\nthat you'll see on the exam.\n\n461\n00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.640\nBut make sure you take a look, especially\nat these commands that are listed here,\n\n462\n00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.890\nas you start to set\nsomething like this up.\n\n463\n00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.730\nDoing what I just did\nhere is the equivalent\n\n464\n00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:23.520\nof what we would actually see here\ninside of the web UI as well.\n\n465\n00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.144\nSo this whole page that they made so\nbeautifully for us and\n\n466\n00:27:27.144 --> 00:27:30.098\nthey gave us such a nice\nintuitive way to do it.\n\n467\n00:27:30.098 --> 00:27:33.983\nThen they said, here's what you also\nneed to know for the exam, too.\n\n468\n00:27:33.983 --> 00:27:37.820\nYou've got to actually\nknow what to put there.\n\n469\n00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.710\nWell, creating a domain is probably\none of the harder ones to remember,\n\n470\n00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:42.235\nbut it's simple.\n\n471\n00:27:42.235 --> 00:27:45.537\nNew-EdgeDomainPattern, figure out what\nyour domain pattern is, add it in.\n\n472\n00:27:45.537 --> 00:27:49.378\nAnd then, once you do that,\nyou're gonna create that list.\n\n473\n00:27:49.378 --> 00:27:53.333\nThe way to apply it is right here, okay?\n\n474\n00:27:53.333 --> 00:27:58.122\nThe last one is allowing that consumer\nSkype user to be able to connect\n\n475\n00:27:58.122 --> 00:27:59.865\ninto our organization.\n\n476\n00:27:59.865 --> 00:28:05.580\nIt all fits right here the way\nthat we actually want it to.\n\n477\n00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.359\nIt really does help us out when we\nactually do need these settings to\n\n478\n00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:09.904\ncome up.\n\n479\n00:28:09.904 --> 00:28:14.486\nAnd now you actually not only see where\nit logically fits in in the web UI.\n\n480\n00:28:14.486 --> 00:28:19.331\nYou also now see where it also fits in for\nthe PowerShell as well, and\n\n481\n00:28:19.331 --> 00:28:24.300\nthat is what we're doing is setting up for\nexternal access.\n\n482\n00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.970\nThere's a lot more for us to go, but\nZach, I have talked a long time and\n\n483\n00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.890\nthat probably means I've almost\nrun out of time here too.\n\n484\n00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:32.430\n&gt;&gt; But we've enjoyed that as well.\n\n485\n00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:36.200\nManage Skype global settings\nPart 2 will be coming up.\n\n486\n00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.380\nMake sure to review Part 1.\n\n487\n00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.820\nAnd Ronnie, thanks very much.\n\n488\n00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:47.030\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV as we\ncontinue to enable Office 365 services.\n\n489\n00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.210\nI'm your host Zach Memes.\n\n490\n00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.070\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n491\n00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.228\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n492\n00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:58.784\n[MUSIC]\n\n493\n00:28:58.784 --> 00:29:01.109\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.409\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:12.436\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:13.248\n&gt;&gt; Hello again.\n\n6\n00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:15.083\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:16.856\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:20.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host Zach Memos for\nEnabling Office 365 Services.\n\n9\n00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.788\nAnd we are going to add some more\ninformation about managing Skype Global\n\n10\n00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:26.602\nsettings.\n\n11\n00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:29.800\nThis is the addendum or\nthe lab information, right, Ronnie?\n\n12\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.680\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n13\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.280\nThere was a setting that we had just\ntalked about in terms of Cloud PBX,\n\n14\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.370\nwhere I showed you that everything was\nconfigurable up to a certain point where I\n\n15\n00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.036\nhad to wait a little bit of time.\n\n16\n00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:44.668\nBecause it really does allow for,\nonce you actually buy the subscription\n\n17\n00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:48.340\nthat you need to,\nthat it's not an instantaneous thing.\n\n18\n00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.630\nAnd this setting really did take about 13,\n14,\n\n19\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.920\n15 hours before the rest\nof it was able to complete.\n\n20\n00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.893\nSo instead of us trying to hold off the\nshow and re-record it, then, I just said,\n\n21\n00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.634\nwe'll finish this at a later date.\n\n22\n00:01:01.634 --> 00:01:04.280\nAnd it has become that later date for\nus to finish this.\n\n23\n00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.880\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nSo\n\n24\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.692\nthere's going to be managed Skype Global\nsettings part one, part 1.5,\n\n25\n00:01:09.692 --> 00:01:10.829\ntwo, and three.\n\n26\n00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.037\nSo make sure you watch all those.\n\n27\n00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:12.710\nGo ahead, Ronnie.\n\n28\n00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.840\n&gt;&gt; When you start to take a look at this,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.220\nSo let's get back to where we were\nin the middle of that setting.\n\n30\n00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.040\nWe were talking about making sure\nthat we can get the Skype for\n\n31\n00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.770\nBusiness, and the Cloud PBX all set up.\n\n32\n00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.340\nWe're just taking a look at voice,\nas where we normally start here.\n\n33\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.200\nAnd what you have everything set up,\nyou'll end up seeing, now instead of\n\n34\n00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.450\nwhere it tells you, you don't have\nany licensing services available.\n\n35\n00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.584\nCurrently, notice,\n\n36\n00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:42.173\nit says I have nine licenses that\nare actually available to me instead.\n\n37\n00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:45.250\nAnd that's how you know that you're\nready to configure the rest of this.\n\n38\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.692\nWithout that particular configuration,\nwell,\n\n39\n00:01:47.692 --> 00:01:50.025\nyou don't have that\nability to finish this up.\n\n40\n00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:52.360\nAnd that's why we weren't able to do this.\n\n41\n00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.920\nNow, all I'm gonna do is\nclick on the plus sign.\n\n42\n00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.480\nAnd it's here that you also saw in\nthat previous episode where it said,\n\n43\n00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.960\nyou don't have any\nnumbers available to you.\n\n44\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.110\nEven though I purchased it,\nit still takes time to set this up.\n\n45\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.210\nSo now I can select get new numbers or get\nphone numbers to assign to individuals.\n\n46\n00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.810\nAnd it's just gonna take a moment and then\nit will give me a list of these numbers.\n\n47\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.860\nNow, I showed you where you could\ndo this with a service numbers, and\n\n48\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.500\nit's about the same thing, but\nit's not exactly the same.\n\n49\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.680\nSo I'm gonna select where I am,\nwhich is inside of the Florida, and\n\n50\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.700\nthen the particular city here.\n\n51\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.770\nAnd then it says I can acquire a total\nof nine numbers right now if I want to.\n\n52\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.480\nIf I had nine phones that I really needed,\nthat's exactly what I'd do.\n\n53\n00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.560\nI'd just type the number nine.\n\n54\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.780\nBut let me just be a little\nbit conservative and\n\n55\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.490\nI'll type in three\nadditional numbers instead.\n\n56\n00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.170\nThen I can click Add.\n\n57\n00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.200\nAnd it will take a look.\n\n58\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.150\nAnd this is all live time at this point.\n\n59\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.850\nSo I have to wait on services.\n\n60\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.150\nIf they're not available, I just have to\nwait until they're actually available.\n\n61\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.356\nBut here is where you can see, we're\nin Gainesville, here's the area code.\n\n62\n00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:01.960\nAnd now I selected three new numbers.\n\n63\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.320\nIf I click show numbers,\n\n64\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.010\nhere are the three available numbers\nthat I have that I can acquire.\n\n65\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.322\nNow, if I don't want,\nto I can simple uncheck this.\n\n66\n00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.696\nIf I wanna acquire all of them, I can.\n\n67\n00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:13.312\nAnd it depends on the number\nof subscriptions.\n\n68\n00:03:13.312 --> 00:03:16.690\nNotice I have ten minutes left\nto acquire these numbers.\n\n69\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.652\nThey're pretty much telling me that, look,\nif you don't acquire them in the next ten\n\n70\n00:03:19.652 --> 00:03:22.075\nminutes, I'm gonna put them\nback in the general pool.\n\n71\n00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:23.630\nSomebody else that comes\nalong in Gainesville,\n\n72\n00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.260\nif they wanna take those numbers,\nthey're gonna be able to take them.\n\n73\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.222\nSo they don't really set it for long.\n\n74\n00:03:28.222 --> 00:03:33.178\nI don't just get to say, just kinda set\nthese up for the next ten minutes or so.\n\n75\n00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:33.990\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n76\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.980\nYou can't keep them for like 12 hours or\ntwo weeks or two years.\n\n77\n00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.703\nYou just have to be able\nto select what you want.\n\n78\n00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:44.560\nSo let me go ahead and\nacquire those three numbers for right now.\n\n79\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.540\nNow, I really didn't have\nto buy a ton of licenses.\n\n80\n00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:55.180\nI only bought two additional licenses for\nthat Cloud PBX on the,\n\n81\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.250\nthe PSTM, the publicly switched telephone\nnetwork, on the domestic calling plan.\n\n82\n00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.390\nAnd once I did that,\nI was able to get these numbers.\n\n83\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.100\nA new thing also appeared up here,\nwhich is port orders.\n\n84\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.840\nNow, you might wonder,\nwhat the heck are port orders about?\n\n85\n00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.429\nWell, let's say that Zach has had his\ntelephone number for 20 years and\n\n86\n00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.551\nit's for his old business,\nit's been working.\n\n87\n00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:21.032\nAnd now that he's switching to\nthis Cloud PBX with Office 365,\n\n88\n00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:23.770\nhe's like,\ndo I have to get a new phone number?\n\n89\n00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.360\nNo, he really doesn't.\n\n90\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.010\nHe can instead just actually\nport that number over, and\n\n91\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.731\nnow he can actually have his particular\nnumber that he's been using, let's say\n\n92\n00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:36.050\nit's his number to his professional\nline that he wanted to keep using.\n\n93\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.046\nHe can still use that.\n\n94\n00:04:37.046 --> 00:04:41.473\nHe can actually take that number and\napply into Skype for Business and\n\n95\n00:04:41.473 --> 00:04:44.320\nhe's off and ready to go once that's done.\n\n96\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.912\nNow, to finish this completion and\nwhat we have to do is once we have this.\n\n97\n00:04:48.912 --> 00:04:51.220\nAnd I already did a few numbers before.\n\n98\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.500\nYou can see where one has actually\nbeen assigned to a user already,\n\n99\n00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.190\nwhich is the one down here.\n\n100\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.210\nAnd then there's the conference bridge.\n\n101\n00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.341\nBut all these other assigned numbers.\n\n102\n00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:04.250\nSo, let's say it's going\nto be Joey at this point.\n\n103\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.160\nI can click this particular number here,\nlet me not select this one here.\n\n104\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.650\nI can click this number and\nthen go to assign, and it's gonna either\n\n105\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.290\nbalk at me or it's gonna say something\nelse, that everything is not ready.\n\n106\n00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.127\nAnd what it means by if\nyou see where it says,\n\n107\n00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:27.057\nyou can't assign this until\nyou get an emergency location.\n\n108\n00:05:27.057 --> 00:05:29.943\nWell, it lets you know that\nbefore you can assign a number,\n\n109\n00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:32.380\nyou have to have at least\none emergency location.\n\n110\n00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.120\nAnd they don't mean\nan emergency telephone number,\n\n111\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.152\nthey mean an actual physical location.\n\n112\n00:05:37.152 --> 00:05:40.660\nSo here is the actual address\nto our physical building.\n\n113\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.740\nAnd that is all due to like the 911\nsystem and emergency numbers and\n\n114\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.050\nhow they end up dialing and everything.\n\n115\n00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.930\nNow, you'll be able to enter in an actual\nstreet address and whatever you want.\n\n116\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.270\nThen it will go out and\ntry to validate the number.\n\n117\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.459\nIf that number's not validated, it's not\ngoing to allow you to assign a number.\n\n118\n00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:01.520\nSo it doesn't always have to be exact.\n\n119\n00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.969\nIt has to be near something that,\nwhatever their mapping system is,\n\n120\n00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:06.850\nthey have to be able to do.\n\n121\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.960\nThe way to do that is you would\nclick on this plus sign and\n\n122\n00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.480\nthen you type in the name and\nthe address and you select the region.\n\n123\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.610\nFrom that point,\nit will allow you to do that.\n\n124\n00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.989\nNow, I've already typed in mine,\nso I'm not so worried about.\n\n125\n00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:21.190\nAnd that's why it accepted right away.\n\n126\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.450\nBut once everything is done and\nit's validated, then I can go back to\n\n127\n00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.810\nphone numbers and do exactly like\nwhat we talked about is assign it.\n\n128\n00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.570\nOnce I assign it, now I have to\npick who I'm gonna assign this to.\n\n129\n00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.696\nLet's say it's Joey here for a moment.\n\n130\n00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:38.660\nAnd I'm gonna tell it to search\nusing the magnifying glass.\n\n131\n00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.710\nAnd in a moment, it says, hey,\nI found one voice user, and that's Joey.\n\n132\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.911\nAnd from here, once I get everything done,\nemergency location,\n\n133\n00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:52.592\nI have to assign that number as well.\n\n134\n00:06:52.592 --> 00:06:55.590\nAnd now notice the save button appeared.\n\n135\n00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.280\nIf I forget to assign this, the save\nbutton will not allow me to save it.\n\n136\n00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.197\nSo now I have it with a physical\naddress and this number.\n\n137\n00:07:04.197 --> 00:07:07.070\nThen I can click save\nto this number as well.\n\n138\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.210\nAnd that will allow me to\nassign that number in.\n\n139\n00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.960\nAnd now the changes have\nbeen successfully saved.\n\n140\n00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.550\nYou can see where it's pending.\n\n141\n00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.600\nThis may take a bit of time as well\nbefore the number becomes active.\n\n142\n00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.060\nSo this can take a few minutes or\nit can take several hours.\n\n143\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.938\nI normally would probably wait probably\novernight before I tell anybody,\n\n144\n00:07:26.938 --> 00:07:28.915\ngo ahead and start using that number.\n\n145\n00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:32.340\nBut sometimes they do allow you to\nassign in it and works right away.\n\n146\n00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.821\nBut I would check and make sure that\nit's actually not pending anymore.\n\n147\n00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:41.030\nOnce it's not pending,\nit becomes activated, and\n\n148\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.290\nalso it becomes assigned at that point.\n\n149\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.779\nAnd then you are ready to go.\n\n150\n00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:47.809\nOnce everything is ready to go,\n\n151\n00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:52.568\nthen you have now officially set up\na system that will begin to work for you.\n\n152\n00:07:52.568 --> 00:07:56.249\nAll these other numbers that you\nhave as you hire new people in,\n\n153\n00:07:56.249 --> 00:08:00.694\nyou can assign them the same way, give\nthem the location of your building for\n\n154\n00:08:00.694 --> 00:08:02.172\nthe emergency contact.\n\n155\n00:08:02.172 --> 00:08:06.150\nAnd that will also give them that\naccess to be able to do that.\n\n156\n00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.950\nSo, that is kind of exactly\nwhat we need to do to complete\n\n157\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.640\nthat portion of what we\nwere showing you for\n\n158\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.860\na lab setting inside of the Skype settings\nthat we've been talking about, the global\n\n159\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.360\nsettings that will help us out, making\nsure that we do get everybody configured.\n\n160\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.710\nAnd of course the ability to use\na telephone that we can now assign.\n\n161\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.760\nNow, the neat thing about the phones,\nright.\n\n162\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.920\nAs you buy these phones,\nyou don't have to actually go in like,\n\n163\n00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.070\nnow I need to make sure that I\nprogram this phone number in.\n\n164\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:40.901\nAll they need is their\nOffice 365 account and,\n\n165\n00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:46.330\non those phones, they just enter in\ntheir email address and their passwords,\n\n166\n00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.050\nand that will automatically\nconnect them to the right number,\n\n167\n00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.480\nit will set up everything for them.\n\n168\n00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.700\nThere's not a ton of\nconfiguration left for\n\n169\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.910\nthem to do as long as they\nare connected online.\n\n170\n00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.390\nAnd the other valuable thing about this,\nZach,\n\n171\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.110\nis now they can take that handset and\nphone.\n\n172\n00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.440\nI don't know, I'm pretty sure somebody\ndoes this, it wouldn't be me.\n\n173\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.290\nBut they can take that phone and\nif they go on a business trip somewhere,\n\n174\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.399\nthey just have to plug in to a place\nwhere there's an Internet connection and\n\n175\n00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:17.016\nit will plug right back up and\nthat phone number will work for them.\n\n176\n00:09:17.016 --> 00:09:18.720\n&gt;&gt; They'll be connected.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly that way, yeah.\n\n177\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.990\nSo without anything else needing to be\nset up, to me that's an amazing thing.\n\n178\n00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.100\nMost people are like, no big deal,\nthat's been working for 20 years.\n\n179\n00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.900\nBut it's still amazing to me-\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing.\n\n180\n00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.350\n&gt;&gt; That that's what happens.\n\n181\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.830\nSo that is how you set that up, and\n\n182\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.210\nthat will show you that you have\nthat ability to control this now.\n\n183\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.533\nYou don't have to a call a telephone\ncompany to set up something that, for\n\n184\n00:09:38.533 --> 00:09:42.086\nme, five years ago, ten years ago,\nI would have said, that's too complex.\n\n185\n00:09:42.086 --> 00:09:44.080\nI don't even wanna try and do that.\n\n186\n00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.350\nNow we can set it up using a web UI,\nand we are off and ready to go, Zach.\n\n187\n00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.306\nAnd that is kind of very neat\nin terms of the Cloud PBX\n\n188\n00:09:52.306 --> 00:09:55.989\nsystem that we have\naccess to in Office 365.\n\n189\n00:09:55.989 --> 00:10:00.070\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, thank you for this great follow\nup to Managing Skype Global Settings.\n\n190\n00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.444\nSo, once again, this is a follow up to\nManaging Skype Global Settings Part 1.\n\n191\n00:10:04.444 --> 00:10:08.009\nAnd there's part 1, 1.5, 2,\n\n192\n00:10:08.009 --> 00:10:12.390\nand 3 inside of the Office 365 services.\n\n193\n00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.098\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n194\n00:10:14.098 -->

00:00:11.754\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.754 --> 00:00:16.780\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.700\nHelp you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.460\nWe are here, I'm Zack Memos,\nwe're enabling Office 365 services\n\n7\n00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.420\nas we continue with\nManage Skype Global Settings.\n\n8\n00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.764\nAnd this is gonna be part two so, Ronnie,\nwho's our IT pro, hello Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:33.161\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Give us kind of review of what we went\n\n10\n00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:34.530\nover in part one.\n\n11\n00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, as we take a look now,\nbecause we're into part two.\n\n12\n00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.290\nWe did start off by taking a look at, of\ncourse, setting up for external users to\n\n13\n00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.940\nconnect in to our Skype for Business\ntypes of accounts that we have, right?\n\n14\n00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.700\nIn that setting we have to, of course,\n\n15\n00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.670\nmake sure that we can get those\ncommunications happening.\n\n16\n00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.390\nAnd we showed you how to\nrestrict domain settings.\n\n17\n00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.400\nAs well as to take a look at Skype users\nthat are not connected to businesses,\n\n18\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.540\nand how we can do that.\n\n19\n00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.120\nWe did that from the web UI,\n\n20\n00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.220\nmaking sure that you understood those\noptions that are available there.\n\n21\n00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.310\nThen we went into the PowerShell and\nshowed you the commands that you can run\n\n22\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.520\nright there to get\nthe same settings as well.\n\n23\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.960\nAnd for exam you've gotta make\nsure you pay attention to both.\n\n24\n00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.670\nI wish I could just say here do this one,\nbut don't worry about that one.\n\n25\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.700\nBut in the way the exam objectives\nare set up, they call for both.\n\n26\n00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.070\nSo make sure you spend a bit of time in\nboth of those as you get that set up.\n\n27\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.940\nA little bit more complex\nin the PowerShell,\n\n28\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.600\nbecause the PowerShell itself is\nnot an intuitive syntax of what\n\n29\n00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.080\nwe tend to see a lot with like the other\nPowerShell methods that are out there.\n\n30\n00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.470\nThat are really kind of fully baked in,\n\n31\n00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.790\nthis one seems to be\nmore hobbled together.\n\n32\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.690\nAnd using an older technology called Lync\nto try and bring everything up to date.\n\n33\n00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.650\nAnd they are working on it,\nit is getting better.\n\n34\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.810\nBut at this point, you'll still see\nold nomenclature that's there too.\n\n35\n00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.130\nSo that's where we got to,\nis that particular point.\n\n36\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.210\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the show notes\nwill have that in there as well.\n\n37\n00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.490\nSo we don't have to\nworry about that at all.\n\n38\n00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.560\nAnd that's great, and in fact,\nright along with you.\n\n39\n00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.610\nBut now we're going into\nsome new territory.\n\n40\n00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.270\nDo we have to worry\nabout firewall settings?\n\n41\n00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.640\nCan we change firewall settings\nwhen we make these changes?\n\n42\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's something that really\ndoes go along with that episode one, and\n\n43\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.150\nI'm glad that you reminded me.\n\n44\n00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.610\nBecause we do have to think about that,\nright?\n\n45\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.690\nIf we make these types of changes\nthat we're talking about to allow for\n\n46\n00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.630\nexternal users to connect in.\n\n47\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.650\nIt also means that on our end,\nif we're gonna to be connecting outbound,\n\n48\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.540\nwe also may need to consider\nsome firewall settings, too.\n\n49\n00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.470\nThat allow for the outbound\nconnections to specific services\n\n50\n00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.020\nthat are outside of our own organization.\n\n51\n00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.550\nBut part of the Skype infrastructure\nthat's also out there.\n\n52\n00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.670\nSo we do need to consider those things.\n\n53\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.440\nNow if you're not sure,\nif you're going, my gosh,\n\n54\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.000\nRonnie, what do I need\nto think about here?\n\n55\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.410\nWell there's a couple of things, right?\n\n56\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.660\nIf you're running Windows Firewall,\nthe great thing is for end users.\n\n57\n00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.880\nThey don't have to worry about anything,\nokay?\n\n58\n00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.140\nIf that is their basic firewall\nthat they're sitting on, and\n\n59\n00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.800\nthat you really don't have anything else.\n\n60\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.600\nSkype for Business,\n\n61\n00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.890\nwhen you install that on the individual\nhome computer, it's done.\n\n62\n00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.910\nThey open up the exceptions\nthat they need so\n\n63\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.420\nthat they can communicate\nwith who they need to.\n\n64\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.110\nAnd so you don't have to worry\nabout the end user settings.\n\n65\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.590\nBut if you're sitting\nbehind a firewall for\n\n66\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.230\nyour organization inside\nthe Azure network.\n\n67\n00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.030\nYou may have to consider adding\nin a few different domains for\n\n68\n00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.170\nthose external connections to be allowed.\n\n69\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.740\nBecause it is just\nsomething that can block\n\n70\n00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.060\nall of the things that you're\ntrying to set up and do.\n\n71\n00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.830\nEven if you allow for\n\n72\n00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.440\neverything else to come in,\nyou still have to get connected to those.\n\n73\n00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.450\nSo when we start to take a look at that,\nyou might be wondering,\n\n74\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.320\nwhere the heck do I find those settings,\nwhat do I do?\n\n75\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.310\nWell, let me show you here.\n\n76\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.010\nOver on my computer,\nI brought up a list here, okay?\n\n77\n00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.240\nAnd we'll have the link for\nthis article inside of the show notes.\n\n78\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.090\nSo don't try and copy this thing down.\n\n79\n00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.360\nIf you do,\nyou're gonna go a little bit blind.\n\n80\n00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.168\nGo ahead, Zack,\nmemorize those first 26 numbers there.\n\n81\n00:04:04.168 --> 00:04:07.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Put them in the notes and\nwe're good.\n\n82\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'll be well on your way\nto losing your mind at some point as\n\n83\n00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.710\nwe start doing this.\n\n84\n00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.220\nBut right here, it's gonna be the Office\n365 URLs and IP address ranges.\n\n85\n00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.150\nIt doesn't mean you have to add\neverything into your firewall.\n\n86\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.690\nBut it does give you some, especially\nwhen you have issues of what's happening.\n\n87\n00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.495\nSo if I scroll down through here,\nand this is a great resource, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:27.495 --> 00:04:31.000\nOf course, you have to have internet\nconnectivity so that makes sense.\n\n89\n00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.400\nI'm not gonna go too much in that.\n\n90\n00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.087\nBut as I scroll down, I want us to take\na look at this list right here, okay.\n\n91\n00:04:38.087 --> 00:04:41.346\nAnd some of the different things\nthat we're setting up for.\n\n92\n00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:45.030\nIf all of a sudden I go,\nI wonder if I need any exceptions or\n\n93\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.560\nanything that I have to put in for\nSkype for Business?\n\n94\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.700\nThe great thing is I can look down\nthis list, and look at that, Zack.\n\n95\n00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.440\nRight there, where it says Skype for\nBusiness, if I click on it,\n\n96\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.330\nit will bring me to the proper\nlink here for Skype for Business.\n\n97\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.150\nNow this is just further down\non that webpage, it really is.\n\n98\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.060\nIf you scroll all the way down,\nyou'll see it actually brings you here.\n\n99\n00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.335\nBut right here it shows you,\nto use Skype for\n\n100\n00:05:06.335 --> 00:05:09.856\nBusiness online ensure both FQDN\nthe fully qualified domain name.\n\n101\n00:05:09.856 --> 00:05:13.008\nAnd IP address endpoints\nare listed in the Skype for\n\n102\n00:05:13.008 --> 00:05:15.436\nBusiness tables below are reachable.\n\n103\n00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:18.490\nIn other words,\nmake sure that they're there.\n\n104\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.780\nAll you have to do then is\ncheck these out right here.\n\n105\n00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.333\nSo we click on the drop down arrow, and\nnow you can see what is actually required.\n\n106\n00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:31.310\nIf there's anything that you\nactually have to put in.\n\n107\n00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.320\nSo for us, it says see office\nauthentication identity, and\n\n108\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.910\nnot really for what we want.\n\n109\n00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.040\nMaybe something like this, and this is\nwhere you see some of that old system.\n\n110\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.300\nNotice it says not Skype for\nBusiness, but what?\n\n111\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.709\nLync, L-Y-N-C,\nyou might still have to add that in here.\n\n112\n00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:50.740\nCQ Lync, look at that?\n\n113\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.540\nLync again, Lync, look, Lync,\nLync, Lync, Lync, you name it.\n\n114\n00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.080\nFinally, down here, Pipe,\nif you're actually doing Skype Telemetry.\n\n115\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.509\nSo, it gives you a list of some of these.\n\n116\n00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.280\nIt doesn't mean you have\nto have them all in.\n\n117\n00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.670\nBut just kind of remember that, on\ndifferent systems, it may be required for\n\n118\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.330\nyou, so check this out.\n\n119\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.800\nThis one here, in the Optional Settings.\n\n120\n00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.810\nThis is what we're normally looking for,\nwhere it's actually something .api.\n\n121\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.910\nAnd notice it's Skype,\nthis is kind of new for us, then.\n\n122\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.640\nAnd then, of course,\nthe users.storage.live.\n\n123\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.610\nIf you're transferring files,\nif you're doing that,\n\n124\n00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.200\nyou need to make sure that you have that.\n\n125\n00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.180\nAnd then this last one here, on public\nIM connectivity, graphs.skype.com.\n\n126\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.710\nSome of these are actually settings that\nwe just make sure that our clients can\n\n127\n00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.330\nget through, and\nwe can set those up on the firewall.\n\n128\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.650\nIt also gives you a list of IP addresses\nover here that may also be needed,\n\n129\n00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.400\nif you want to make sure that\neverything gets through.\n\n130\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.950\nSo that will all be done for you.\n\n131\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.280\nNow, if you're not good with setting up\nthe firewall, it's understandable, right?\n\n132\n00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.150\nNot everybody gets to play\naround with the firewall.\n\n133\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.630\nEven though you may be the Skype\nadministrator, it means you simply need to\n\n134\n00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.880\ngo and contact the network infrastructure\nteam, or the security team.\n\n135\n00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.240\nAnd say, hey, I need Skype for Business to\nwork, and here's the guidance that I have.\n\n136\n00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.607\nAnd you send them that link and say,\nscroll down to the Skype for Business.\n\n137\n00:07:11.607 --> 00:07:16.170\nAnd those are some of the settings,\nand here's what we need specifically.\n\n138\n00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.730\nIn the show notes, I've kinda narrowed\ndown the ones that we'll really talk\n\n139\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.220\nabout, and I just mentioned them here too.\n\n140\n00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.582\nBut just take a look at them, and\nmake sure that you understand.\n\n141\n00:07:25.582 --> 00:07:29.385\nThe team that's actually configuring\nthe firewall, managing that for you.\n\n142\n00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:31.150\nWill probably understand\na little bit more than you do,\n\n143\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.410\nif you're not really good with that.\n\n144\n00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.633\nBut if you are, just kinda let them know,\nhere's what needs to be done.\n\n145\n00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:39.776\nSo firewall settings may have\nto be configured if you want\n\n146\n00:07:39.776 --> 00:07:43.790\nthe external access to really work\nthe way that you want them to.\n\n147\n00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.410\nIt's not always necessary, but usually\nthat's what you'll also end up seeing.\n\n148\n00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.603\nSo it's a good question,\nit's a good reminder for us.\n\n149\n00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:54.197\nThat even though we might\nhave everything set up,\n\n150\n00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:57.614\nit doesn't take much before\nsomething else can stand in the way.\n\n151\n00:07:57.614 --> 00:08:00.965\nAnd in security today,\nthis is the way that we have to do things.\n\n152\n00:08:00.965 --> 00:08:03.633\nSo we'll make sure that we cover that.\n\n153\n00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:07.067\nNow, since Zach talked about\nof course new topics and\n\n154\n00:08:07.067 --> 00:08:10.957\nsome of the other things that\nwe have to globally configure is\n\n155\n00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:14.560\nthat if you've been invited\nto a Skype meeting before.\n\n156\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.460\nOrganizations have this opportunity\nwhen they get Skype messages and\n\n157\n00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.559\nmeetings to be able to customize what\nwe call the different invitations.\n\n158\n00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:30.505\nAnd this is not necessarily the most, I\nshouldn't say it's not the most important,\n\n159\n00:08:30.505 --> 00:08:34.235\nit's not the crux of how this\nmeetings end up happening.\n\n160\n00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:39.468\nBut it can help identify that particular\nmeeting as well as when somebody\n\n161\n00:08:39.468 --> 00:08:45.471\ngets an invitation that when they do click\non it, you're really kind of giving them\n\n162\n00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:51.769\na nice little perspective of here's some\nlegal agreements that you're agreeing to.\n\n163\n00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:54.160\nIf you choose to, click Connect here.\n\n164\n00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.383\nYou can also give them a link to\nyour Help Site if you want to,\n\n165\n00:08:57.383 --> 00:09:00.495\nin case they don't feel like\nthey can connect properly.\n\n166\n00:09:00.495 --> 00:09:03.420\nYou can add in a custom company logo.\n\n167\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.324\nYou can add in text messaging or\nnot text messaging.\n\n168\n00:09:06.324 --> 00:09:11.067\nBut some type of text that says,\nwelcome to Office Pro Demo Co, for\n\n169\n00:09:11.067 --> 00:09:14.385\nthis meeting that you're\njoining right now.\n\n170\n00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:19.680\nSo you can do that to make it really\nfit your organization's need.\n\n171\n00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.270\nThis more than anything,\n\n172\n00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.710\nis actually an important aspect of\nallowing for external connections.\n\n173\n00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:32.740\nNow, Zach, in the networking and\nsecurity side of things,\n\n174\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.845\nthe problem is legalities of\nconnections that end up happening.\n\n175\n00:09:36.845 --> 00:09:39.496\nSo for example, I'm gonna use\nsomething from the CISCO world, and\n\n176\n00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.412\nthis might not make too much sense to you,\nZach.\n\n177\n00:09:41.412 --> 00:09:43.869\nBut when you put a device\nthat faces the Internet, and\n\n178\n00:09:43.869 --> 00:09:46.553\nyou have the other side that\nfaces your internal network.\n\n179\n00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:49.849\nIf you actually put on that\ndevice's outer interface,\n\n180\n00:09:49.849 --> 00:09:53.648\nthe one that's facing the Internet,\nand people connect to it.\n\n181\n00:09:53.648 --> 00:09:57.978\nAnd it says, welcome to ITPROTV,\nthat sounds like\n\n182\n00:09:57.978 --> 00:10:02.750\nan invitation to come in,\nregardless of their intent.\n\n183\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:07.374\nSo even if they're malicious,\nthey can, in a court of law,\n\n184\n00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:12.746\nat least here in the United States,\nsay, well, Ronnie put welcome.\n\n185\n00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:15.110\nHe didn't say welcome for\nwhat particular reason.\n\n186\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.532\nHe didn't actually say that\nyou're not supposed to be here.\n\n187\n00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:22.310\nYeah, she put welcome right there\non the banner as I connected in.\n\n188\n00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.370\nWell, you gotta think\nabout some of that stuff.\n\n189\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.440\nAnd that might not be your department,\nto actually think about the wording.\n\n190\n00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.080\nBut it might be your job to say,\nall right, let's go to security team,\n\n191\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.130\nlet's go to our security policy.\n\n192\n00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.670\nAnd see is there anything that when we\nextend out these types of invitations,\n\n193\n00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.130\nthat we need to include\non there that the user,\n\n194\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:46.570\nbefore they go click, connect, okay,\nthat they need to know about, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.850\nWell, that's something that\nwould be really helpful to know.\n\n196\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.040\nNot, now that you're here, we can't really\nstart doing any business Zach, you and\n\n197\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.650\nI, because you haven't agreed to\nany of the legal disclaimers here.\n\n198\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.890\nI know if I actually set all that stuff\nup and you click OK, comes back to us and\n\n199\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.140\nZach goes, no,\nhe didn't ever say anything about that.\n\n200\n00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.510\nI can always go, he clicked yes here,\nit means he read the entire agreement.\n\n201\n00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.185\nI'm okay with that.\n\n202\n00:11:10.185 --> 00:11:13.023\n[LAUGH] Regardless of whether or\nnot Zach actually did it.\n\n203\n00:11:13.023 --> 00:11:16.010\nWhen he clicked OK,\nyou can see it here on the last line.\n\n204\n00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.308\nIf you click OK, you're agreeing to\neverything that I'm talking about here,\n\n205\n00:11:19.308 --> 00:11:22.930\nand this is what you can't do or\nwhat you can do with our conversation.\n\n206\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.660\nSo, it is something that you\n\n207\n00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.640\nwant to make sure that you pay\nattention to on how to get it done.\n\n208\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.558\nIt's not our responsibility to figure\nout the wording a lot of times, but\n\n209\n00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:35.208\nif it is your responsibility,\nmake sure you also get it reviewed.\n\n210\n00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:38.031\nBut if it's not, some lawyer has\nprobably reviewed it in-depth,\n\n211\n00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.328\nwith their fine toothed comb.\n\n212\n00:11:39.328 --> 00:11:42.390\nSo make sure you pay attention there, too.\n\n213\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.300\nSo, I know, like I said,\nI get off on a tangent.\n\n214\n00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.660\nThat's what happens.\n\n215\n00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.650\nAll right, so\nhere's where we're gonna go, okay?\n\n216\n00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.500\nLet's go ahead and see if we can\nmodify a particular invitation.\n\n217\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.814\nOver on the left-hand side, we're\ngonna go back down to our admin icon,\n\n218\n00:11:56.814 --> 00:11:58.496\nselect Skype for Business.\n\n219\n00:11:58.496 --> 00:12:03.084\nAnd once we've actually selected Skype for\nBusiness,\n\n220\n00:12:03.084 --> 00:12:06.401\nwe now need to go into, let's see here,\n\n221\n00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:12.272\nlet's make sure I actually know\nwhere to go, Online Meetings, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:12.272 --> 00:12:15.460\nSo if I select Online Meetings and\nthe great thing,\n\n223\n00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.908\nat this point it's pretty intuitive,\n\n224\n00:12:17.908 --> 00:12:22.975\nsince it's the first thing that's\nactually right here, meeting invitation.\n\n225\n00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:28.650\nSo now you can customize the way that\nthis invitation is brought up here.\n\n226\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:34.380\nNow, I do have to warn once again,\nthis is one those, at least these\n\n227\n00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:39.030\nparts of this show that we're doing here,\nfor managing this global configurations.\n\n228\n00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.150\nNothing that we do and I really mean this.\n\n229\n00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.900\nNothing that we do,\nI can show you immediately happening,\n\n230\n00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.300\ncuz everything like this one takes at\nleast an hour if I remember right.\n\n231\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.930\nUp to an hour, yeah.\n\n232\n00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.210\nThis one takes up to\nan hour before changes,\n\n233\n00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.550\nmust wait an hour or longer before\nany changes will really take effect.\n\n234\n00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.210\nSo I can't just sit here and go,\nokay, we'll do the rest of this.\n\n235\n00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.730\nBut that's what we'll do,\nat least set this up.\n\n236\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.890\nNotice the way it says you\ncan customize a Skype for\n\n237\n00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.650\nmeeting invitation to meet\nyour organization's need.\n\n238\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.690\nAdd your own logo,\nreplace the default logo,\n\n239\n00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.310\nyou name it, you can actually add\nall that information in here.\n\n240\n00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.810\nNow, when you do something like this,\nit means that\n\n241\n00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:24.410\nif you actually add in these URLs,\nthese links that you have, that means\n\n242\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.920\nthose links must be available somewhere\nthat it can get to from the Internet.\n\n243\n00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.240\nYou can't store it on your own machine,\nyou actually have to go and\n\n244\n00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.380\nput it someplace.\n\n245\n00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.030\nSo for example, I'm not gonna do\nmuch more besides this one here.\n\n246\n00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.060\nI selected my logo.\n\n247\n00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.960\nAnd I put it in to my drop box and\nI shared it out so\n\n248\n00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.530\nthat people can get access to this.\n\n249\n00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.950\nI can now put that link directly in there.\n\n250\n00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:57.319\nIf I also have a link to my help site,\nlet's just say https here,\n\n251\n00:14:00.704 --> 00:14:06.724\nAnd then we'll do,\nI'm trying to think here,\n\n252\n00:14:06.724 --> 00:14:11.088\nactually I know one that I will do,\n\n253\n00:14:11.088 --> 00:14:14.866\nforums@itpro.tv, okay.\n\n254\n00:14:14.866 --> 00:14:17.237\nSo I've just put in these two.\n\n255\n00:14:17.237 --> 00:14:19.874\nSo this is to our forum site it's\nnot really to our help site but\n\n256\n00:14:19.874 --> 00:14:23.447\nI'm just trying to show you that you can\nadd in these as long as they're available.\n\n257\n00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:26.861\nThe key here though if these\nare available to documents,\n\n258\n00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:30.273\nthey have to be publicly\navailable out there on the net for\n\n259\n00:14:30.273 --> 00:14:34.260\nus to be able to get access to,\nis what we also want.\n\n260\n00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.950\nThen, adding your footer text\nwill of course will appear\n\n261\n00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.560\nin the meeting invitation that you'll see.\n\n262\n00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.820\nAnd normally for us, we're including\nnot only that in the legal but\n\n263\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.960\nwe're actually saying hey,\nif you click next,\n\n264\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.960\nyou're agreeing to the legal\ndisclaimer above and that you've read.\n\n265\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.010\nWhatever you might want to do,\nit's something like that.\n\n266\n00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.330\nEven in something like this,\neven though there's no real\n\n267\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.650\nstandardization of this\nsomewhere out there.\n\n268\n00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:07.640\nI don't recommend you just saying, hey,\nconnect whenever you want, do all this.\n\n269\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.220\nEven though it's actually kind of limited,\nit should not actually be\n\n270\n00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.840\nan invitation to welcome someone\nto just kind of just say,\n\n271\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.800\nall right,\nI have free run of whatever I want to.\n\n272\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.937\nThe great thing is without the invitation\nwhen the meetings expired, it's expired.\n\n273\n00:15:21.937 --> 00:15:25.594\nIt doesn't really matter, but\nat the same time, it shouldn't\n\n274\n00:15:25.594 --> 00:15:29.670\nactually be something where it can be\nambiguous as you add this text in.\n\n275\n00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.000\nYou wanna add in a quote, that's fine, but\n\n276\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.041\ndon't make it ambiguous such as,\nwelcome to the system here, and\n\n277\n00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:43.250\nfeel free to join or to drop by,\npoke around on my network here.\n\n278\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.650\nThat's not what it should be.\n\n279\n00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:48.110\nIt should be again something that's\nvery specific if you do this, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.683\nSo that's kinda of the security side\nof things that I'm normally talk about.\n\n281\n00:15:51.683 --> 00:15:55.390\nSo if I add that in there,\nall I have to do is click Save.\n\n282\n00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.871\nAnd once I do that, it tells me that my\nchanges have been successfully saved.\n\n283\n00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:04.498\nBut it does warn us in Office\n365 own documentation.\n\n284\n00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:05.819\nIt says, don't try and\n\n285\n00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:10.350\ntest this out into at least an hour\nafter these settings have taken place.\n\n286\n00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.660\nSo it's not gonna work.\n\n287\n00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.070\nRemember that in your organization,\nif you even only have let's say 100 users,\n\n288\n00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:21.380\nall that stuff has to populate out to\nevery meeting that's been created and\n\n289\n00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.840\nthat's ready to go.\n\n290\n00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.084\nSo it's not like it's just saying okay\nI've set this, now it's going to apply to\n\n291\n00:16:26.084 --> 00:16:28.456\nnew meetings, it still has to go back and\ndo all that stuff.\n\n292\n00:16:28.456 --> 00:16:32.623\nSo it's gonna take a little bit of time,\nbefore it can actually come out and\n\n293\n00:16:32.623 --> 00:16:34.960\nset it to be able to do that.\n\n294\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.770\nNow, the other way of course that we have\nto understand then, is what do you think?\n\n295\n00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.660\nPowerShell, do you think\nis that PowerShell?\n\n296\n00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.620\nIs probably what we have to do.\n\n297\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.762\n&gt;&gt; I think you need to go to PowerShell.\n\n298\n00:16:43.762 --> 00:16:45.432\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; More than likely,\n\n299\n00:16:45.432 --> 00:16:50.125\njust like everything else on the exam,\nPowerShell is a huge part of it so\n\n300\n00:16:50.125 --> 00:16:54.763\nwe also need to take a look at this\nidea at least in PowerShell briefly.\n\n301\n00:16:54.763 --> 00:16:56.635\nWe are not gonna show everything here, and\n\n302\n00:16:56.635 --> 00:17:00.070\nevery single instance of what we are gonna\ndo but we will show a little bit of it.\n\n303\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.482\nIf I wanted to set this up, let me see\nif I can zoom in just a little bit more,\n\n304\n00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:06.838\nthat will help us out.\n\n305\n00:17:06.838 --> 00:17:15.579\nSet-CsMeetingConfiguration, then\nat this point,\n\n306\n00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:21.092\nlet me see, I can do my -LogoURL.\n\n307\n00:17:21.092 --> 00:17:26.088\nFrom that, I simply paste in,\nthere it is my logo URL.\n\n308\n00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:29.758\nThen of course you can continue to\nadd in the other ones that you want,\n\n309\n00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:32.161\nthe legal thing that you\nwant to be able to do,\n\n310\n00:17:32.161 --> 00:17:36.553\nfolder, you name it, all that is actually\npossibly and that's what we can do it.\n\n311\n00:17:36.553 --> 00:17:40.390\nNow I'm not gonna run it, cuz I\nalready did the save in the other one.\n\n312\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.450\nBut you get the idea.\n\n313\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.690\nThat this is what will end up\nhappening when you do Dareza.\n\n314\n00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:52.310\nSo, just as an example, make sure you do\npay attention to that particular command,\n\n315\n00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:56.210\nif you talk about customizing\nthis types of imitations.\n\n316\n00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.430\nOnce again, whether it's in PowerShell or\nwhether it's through th Web UI.\n\n317\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.430\nThis can take about an hour before these\nchanges will actually take effect, and\n\n318\n00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.140\nthey recommend that you wait an hour\nbefore you even try and test it.\n\n319\n00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.800\nAnd not, could be that its\nplaying around with something and\n\n320\n00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.050\nsaying were in the middle of changing\nthings and your still playing around, and\n\n321\n00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:18.960\nso they're saying yeah, just wait, just\nbe very patient, allow that to happen.\n\n322\n00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.680\nMake sure that we're actually\ndoing what we need to.\n\n323\n00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.010\nSo, that's what we want to get\nto when we start doing this.\n\n324\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.910\n&gt;&gt; So, what about push notifications?\n\n325\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.040\nBy default, alerts are on, let's say.\n\n326\n00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.660\nCan we change that?\n\n327\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.830\n&gt;&gt; We really can, and\n\n328\n00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.880\nthat's something that we really want\nto get to understand just a little bit.\n\n329\n00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.577\nSo let's see if I can actually\nfind our push notifications, and\n\n330\n00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:43.878\nemphasize what Zack is really\ntrying to key us into here.\n\n331\n00:18:43.878 --> 00:18:49.142\nSo if I'm actually inside of the Skype for\nBusiness Admin Center,\n\n332\n00:18:49.142 --> 00:18:53.467\nonce I get here,\nI'm going to select organization and\n\n333\n00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:58.205\nunder general here,\nwe should see pop ups sooner or later.\n\n334\n00:18:58.205 --> 00:19:00.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Looks like later things\n\n335\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.850\nare kinda slowing down here.\n\n336\n00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.470\n&gt;&gt; Friday isn't it?\n\n337\n00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.600\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it happens.\n\n338\n00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.740\nSo when we have stuff set up like this.\n\n339\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.522\nSo let's talk about\nwhat Push Notifications\n\n340\n00:19:11.522 --> 00:19:13.430\nactually are helping us to do.\n\n341\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.448\nIf there comes a time when I'm\nrunning Skype For Business and\n\n342\n00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:18.760\neverything else that I'm doing.\n\n343\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.350\nI want notifications to go out if I have\na meeting, and stuff like that to happen.\n\n344\n00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.437\nBut, to get those notifications out,\n\n345\n00:19:25.437 --> 00:19:28.420\nwe normally want to send some\ntype of message to do that.\n\n346\n00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:32.730\nAnd in mobile phones,\nthat's what we call Push Notifications.\n\n347\n00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.810\nSo if I scroll over and\nthis is how they have it set up.\n\n348\n00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.400\nMobile phone notifications,\n\n349\n00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.680\ntechnically on the exam we're gonna call\nthem Push Notifications to or alerts.\n\n350\n00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.496\nYou can turn on alerts for incoming\ninstant messages, voice mail messages,\n\n351\n00:19:46.496 --> 00:19:50.662\nmissed IMs, missed calls for\nSkype for Business, mobile users.\n\n352\n00:19:50.662 --> 00:19:53.601\nBy using a Push Notification Service,\n\n353\n00:19:53.601 --> 00:19:57.630\ninstead of Office 365\nto send those alerts.\n\n354\n00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.860\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhy would I choose to do that?\n\n355\n00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:07.850\nNot everybody has Skype for\nBusiness on their smartphone.\n\n356\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.950\nNow, of course you might go well,\nwhy wouldn't they have it on their phone?\n\n357\n00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.970\nWell, sometimes they just\ndon't want it on their phones.\n\n358\n00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.230\nBut you still want them to\nactually be given that message,\n\n359\n00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.140\nif they're actually going to\nbe having a meeting for it.\n\n360\n00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.110\nSo there are two notification services and\n\n361\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.140\nyou can see here in mine,\nI haven't changed the default.\n\n362\n00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:32.570\nIt is Push Notification Service for\nMicrosoft and for Apple as well.\n\n363\n00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.452\nSo these two are on by default.\n\n364\n00:20:34.452 --> 00:20:37.570\nAnd that's fine if you want\nyour organization to do that.\n\n365\n00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.760\nBut, the exam specifically\nsays to disable them.\n\n366\n00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:47.120\nWhat the great thing is that in\nthe Web UI, disabling is this.\n\n367\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.210\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Now wait a minute.\n\n368\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.020\nThat was too difficult.\n\n369\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that [LAUGH] was way difficult.\n\n370\n00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:55.450\nYeah, that's all it is in terms\nof disabling the service.\n\n371\n00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.130\nSo doing something like that,\n\n372\n00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.260\nthat's how we actually disable\nthose Push Notifications.\n\n373\n00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.490\nIt may still take a little bit of\ntime before that process stops.\n\n374\n00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:10.330\nOn this one I don't have a specific\nperiod of time, but it is\n\n375\n00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:15.290\nsomething that we want to make sure that\nwe do understand and note that here it is.\n\n376\n00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.300\nMake sure you know where this is,\nand make sure you know the setting.\n\n377\n00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.350\nCuz it doesn't say Push Notification here.\n\n378\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.660\nIt just says mobile phone notifications.\n\n379\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.300\nBut if you want to disable\nthem in the Web UI,\n\n380\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.100\nthat of course is the way to\nmake sure that we do that.\n\n381\n00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.150\nNow, on the exam of course, not only\ndo you need to know this, PowerShell.\n\n382\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:39.113\n&gt;&gt; You gotta go to PowerShell to which\nmeans is probably not as intuitive as we\n\n383\n00:21:39.113 --> 00:21:44.236\nthink right at the beginning, but\nI want to know something, it is the future\n\n384\n00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:49.628\nof just about everything that we are going\nto do, is gonna be PowerShell based.\n\n385\n00:21:49.628 --> 00:21:53.367\nSo even though the Web UI's there,\nwe're probably going to end up seeing that\n\n386\n00:21:53.367 --> 00:21:55.985\nit's gonna give us the generic\nfeatures that we want.\n\n387\n00:21:55.985 --> 00:22:00.244\nBut in the future, all of the detailed\nstuff, all of the stuff that is gonna\n\n388\n00:22:00.244 --> 00:22:04.166\ncontinue to move towards the web,\nis all going to be PowerShell based\n\n389\n00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:09.290\nin terms of Cloud services, so you've\ngot to get used to doing it anyways.\n\n390\n00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.460\nLet's go ahead and\nsee what we can actually set up here,\n\n391\n00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.160\nand let me zoom back out and\nI'll take away this particular command.\n\n392\n00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.520\nSo that we can do this.\n\n393\n00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.618\nNow, since both of those boxes are checked\nfor us, we now need to go in and\n\n394\n00:22:23.618 --> 00:22:27.475\nlet's say that we are gonna\nset this up for disabling.\n\n395\n00:22:27.475 --> 00:22:30.080\nLet me zoom in here.\n\n396\n00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.984\nSo that we can say, hopefully it won't\ntake up the entire screen there but\n\n397\n00:22:34.984 --> 00:22:35.865\nthen it may.\n\n398\n00:22:35.865 --> 00:22:43.438\nIf I type in Set-CsPush\nwhich I can't spell,\n\n399\n00:22:43.438 --> 00:22:49.467\nPushNotificationConfiguration.\n\n400\n00:22:49.467 --> 00:22:54.474\nOnce again another insanely long [LAUGH]\ncommand, or commandlet that we have\n\n401\n00:22:54.474 --> 00:23:00.250\navailable to us here, and that is what\nwe want to make sure that we emphasize.\n\n402\n00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:05.280\nEnabling or disabling these notifications,\nwe do a dash for\n\n403\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.645\nthe option and the first one that\nwe're going to do is we're gonna\n\n404\n00:23:08.645 --> 00:23:15.550\nEnableApplePushNotificationService.\n\n405\n00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:20.050\nWow, look at that, that's an option for\nus that we have available to us.\n\n406\n00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:25.540\nNow, this is where Microsoft's unusual\nability to use double negatives,\n\n407\n00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.820\nhas killed us.\n\n408\n00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.670\nSo you would think enable, well,\nthat doesn't sound like it's disabling,\n\n409\n00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:35.255\nwouldn't it be easier to say disable or\nstop?\n\n410\n00:23:35.255 --> 00:23:38.580\nApplePushNotificationService, no,\nthey're not doing that.\n\n411\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:44.090\nIt is an EnablePushNotificationService\nthat now instead of setting it to be true,\n\n412\n00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:48.760\nwe need to set this one up to be false,\nso that makes sense.\n\n413\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.536\nNow, if I wanted to turn off\nthe Microsoft one, I just do an Enable.\n\n414\n00:23:55.196 --> 00:23:59.141\nMicrosoft Notification,\nlet me zoom back out here.\n\n415\n00:24:03.724 --> 00:24:04.831\nSee if I can get, there we go.\n\n416\n00:24:04.831 --> 00:24:06.480\nYou can say where did it go.\n\n417\n00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.730\nEnable Microsoft push\nnotification service and\n\n418\n00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.270\nit's screen wrapped all the way around.\n\n419\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.460\nLet me zoom in, and this one too.\n\n420\n00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.340\n&gt;&gt; False.\n\n421\n00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.100\n&gt;&gt; We set to false, okay.\n\n422\n00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.220\nBy doing that,\nyou should be able to press enter and\n\n423\n00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:28.040\nnow that should actually set it up to\nthe way that we've actually disabled.\n\n424\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.930\nNow, I haven't checked this part out.\n\n425\n00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:34.360\nIt doesn't actually do anything here.\n\n426\n00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.799\nNow, let me click cancel cuz I really\ndon't want to affect itself by overwriding\n\n427\n00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:41.812\nit here cuz if I push it right now,\nthat should arrive.\n\n428\n00:24:41.812 --> 00:24:43.840\nLet me just click off for that thing.\n\n429\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.850\nAnd let's see, I was in organization, so\n\n430\n00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:53.020\nit may also take a bit of time before\nit actually does what we want here.\n\n431\n00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.360\nSo just kinda realize it may not show\nup immediately, but in the background,\n\n432\n00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.280\nwe do know that it did take the command.\n\n433\n00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.420\nWe are able to see this.\n\n434\n00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.860\nI don't know if I have\na Git command with this,\n\n435\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.550\nlet's see if I have\na Git command with this.\n\n436\n00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.760\nEvery once in awhile I get, let's see.\n\n437\n00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.870\nThere we go.\n\n438\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.190\nOkay.\nThere you go, so\n\n439\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.090\nright here it actually shows you.\n\n440\n00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.560\nSo at least we are able to\nverify this one very easily here\n\n441\n00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.360\nby realizing that we have\nnow changed this to false.\n\n442\n00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.700\nAnd it may take that period of time\nbefore It gets fully populated\n\n443\n00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.150\nback into the Web UI and doing\neverything else that we need there too.\n\n444\n00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.600\nSo, don't rush it, that's the only thing\nthat we can say right now especially about\n\n445\n00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.930\nall the cloud services.\n\n446\n00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.160\nThere's a lot of configuration changes in\nthe last hour or so, Zach, between you and\n\n447\n00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.300\nI, I made three or four global changes,\n\n448\n00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:47.330\nnot a change to a single user, but\nacross my entire organization,\n\n449\n00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.670\nand even though it's a small organization\nin terms of three users, right?\n\n450\n00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:56.555\nYou can imagine that if this\nchange affected 600 users,\n\n451\n00:25:56.555 --> 00:26:00.530\n2,000 users, it might take a bit\nof time to actually change.\n\n452\n00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:01.480\nAnd just with three, right?\n\n453\n00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:06.990\nWe've already seen limits of an hour or\n24 hours before changes take place.\n\n454\n00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:10.380\nSo don't think that it\ncan't take a lot longer.\n\n455\n00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:15.005\nJust kinda make sure that you\nunderstand that that process on working\n\n456\n00:26:15.005 --> 00:26:20.270\nwith the the cloud, it is set it and\nwait until the services take place.\n\n457\n00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.940\nWhen it comes too extreme,\nmake sure you contact Microsoft and\n\n458\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.648\nthey can help check that out too.\n\n459\n00:26:24.648 --> 00:26:28.910\nBut overall though those are some of\nthe other services that we need to pay\n\n460\n00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.910\nattention to, to get everything ready.\n\n461\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:37.110\nNow, there's a lot more for us to actually\ncover in terms of these types of getting\n\n462\n00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.650\nSkype for Business set up.\n\n463\n00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:44.220\nWe haven't even actually covered all\nthe other stuff that we have to do.\n\n464\n00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.070\nIf I wanna communicate with people that\ndon't have Skype for business, Justin,\n\n465\n00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:52.970\nand we still need to cover that but once\nagain, Zach, I have talked so much and so\n\n466\n00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.369\nlong that I have run out of time.\n\n467\n00:26:55.369 --> 00:26:58.900\n&gt;&gt; But we covered a lot, we covered\ncustomizing meeting invitations,\n\n468\n00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.420\nwe covered firewall considerations,\npush notifications and\n\n469\n00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:08.420\nthere will be more in Part Three\nof Managing Skype Global Settings.\n\n470\n00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.210\nRonnie, thank you very much.\n\n471\n00:27:10.210

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.555\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:12.130\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.965\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:17.208\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:20.776\nI'm Zack Memos, your host for\nenabling Office 365 Services.\n\n9\n00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:26.554\nWe're continuing on with\nmanaged Skype global settings.\n\n10\n00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:29.840\nThis is part three with our ITPro,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.162\nRonnie, can you kinda quickly bring\nus up to speed, if you can, and\n\n12\n00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:35.810\nthen give us an idea of where we're going?\n\n13\n00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, as we've taken a look,\nnow that we're into part three,\n\n14\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960\nwe're talking essentially about all those\nsettings that we wanna be able to set up\n\n15\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.020\nso that our end users don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n16\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.120\nWhere we're configuring some\ngeneralized settings here globally,\n\n17\n00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.570\nsuch as allowing for\nexternal users to be able to connect in.\n\n18\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.680\nBeing able to create custom notifications\nor invites that we have available to us.\n\n19\n00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.580\nAs well as take a look at how\nwe manage those domains and\n\n20\n00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.250\nallowing access to come in.\n\n21\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.300\nWe've also taken some time to take\na look at push notifications,\n\n22\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.050\nhow we can actually disable those two.\n\n23\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.090\nAnd now it means that we're ready to\nmove on to a different topic as well.\n\n24\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.660\n&gt;&gt; And in fact, I had a question for you.\n\n25\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So Skype for Business,\n\n26\n00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.547\npowerful tool, awesome, great to use.\n\n27\n00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:24.542\nWhat if you were trying to communicate\nwith, you wanna bring someone into your\n\n28\n00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:28.976\nSkype for Business conferencing whatever,\nand they don't have Skype for Business?\n\n29\n00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:31.382\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually a great question.\n\n30\n00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:36.590\nEverything we've talked about so far works\nas long as you actually do have Skype for\n\n31\n00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.280\nBusiness users on one end, Skype for\nBusiness users on the other end.\n\n32\n00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.789\nIt's a great platform for\nbasic communication between, well,\n\n33\n00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.959\ntwo people that essentially have the same\nsoftware running in between them.\n\n34\n00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.160\nAnd you're connecting the Cloud\nservice to make that happen.\n\n35\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.910\nBut not everybody has Skype for\nBusiness as their platform, and\n\n36\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.150\nwhat they use for communications.\n\n37\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.978\nThere are still a lot of companies\nout here that don't run anything,\n\n38\n00:02:01.978 --> 00:02:05.350\nbut just a regular telephone\nsystem that they have in place.\n\n39\n00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.320\nA PST, on a publicly switched\ntelephone network system.\n\n40\n00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.890\nAnd you may still do business with them.\n\n41\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.510\nWell, if I am on my end using Skype for\nBusiness in my business,\n\n42\n00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.470\nhow do I communicate with\nthe company that I want to\n\n43\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.790\nsell ITPro.TV to so\nthat I can communicate with them?\n\n44\n00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.206\nWell, that means I have to\nbe able to connect Skype for\n\n45\n00:02:28.206 --> 00:02:30.903\nBusiness into that publicly\nswitched telephone network.\n\n46\n00:02:30.903 --> 00:02:34.982\nSo that even if I am on a telephonic\ncall with Skype for Business,\n\n47\n00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:40.080\nit can actually go through the publicly\nswitched telephone network as well.\n\n48\n00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.620\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a trick.\n\n49\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.045\n&gt;&gt; And that means that there has to be\nsome technology in the middle of that that\n\n50\n00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:47.865\nhelps us to get connected and\ndo what we want to.\n\n51\n00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:50.490\nOnce we start doing something like that,\n\n52\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.940\nwe do have to actually integrate in some\nadditional technology to help us out.\n\n53\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.060\nAnd this is where licensing becomes\n\n54\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.900\na tremendous issue that we have\nto pay attention to, okay?\n\n55\n00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.780\nSo in this sense, you do have to kind\nof decide for your company whether or\n\n56\n00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.620\nnot everybody is gonna get\na license to be able to do this.\n\n57\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.242\nOr whether only some people are going\nto get a license to do this.\n\n58\n00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:21.109\nBecause it can add up in terms of how much\nmoney that you're willing to spend and\n\n59\n00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.630\ndo this, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.610\nSo you have to kind of\ndetermine stuff like that.\n\n61\n00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.920\nBut let's go ahead and\nshow you at least for\n\n62\n00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.570\nthe licensing side what needs to\nhappen if you start doing this.\n\n63\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.510\nSo on my screen here,\nwe'll go ahead and take a look.\n\n64\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.480\nI am in the Office 365 Admin Center.\n\n65\n00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.210\nIf I click on Users, once I select Users,\n\n66\n00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.210\nI should be able to see something very\nquickly in just this nice summary, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.100\nNotice that, I'm going full screen here,\nyou can see a couple of things here.\n\n68\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.400\nNotice the one for Joey's account\nright here, it has Skype for\n\n69\n00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.110\nBusiness PSTN Domestic Calling and\n\n70\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.720\nyou can also see Office 365 Enterprise E5.\n\n71\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.810\nSame thing if I hover over here for\nLance, Skype for\n\n72\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.380\nBusiness PSTN Domestic Calling and\nOffice 365 Enterprise.\n\n73\n00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.730\nAnd then for JT over here,\njust Office 365 E3.\n\n74\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.380\nThese two will be able\nto actually communicate\n\n75\n00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.540\nwith those that may not have Skype for\nBusiness, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.300\nBut JT here in the middle\nwould not be able to do so.\n\n77\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.946\nNow, if we wanted him to do that,\nit's actually relatively simple.\n\n78\n00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:41.253\nIf I select Justin's account,\n\n79\n00:04:41.253 --> 00:04:45.538\nIt is in here just a moment we\nshould see product licensing.\n\n80\n00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:52.013\nAnd then if I click on Edit under\nProduct Licensing, this is where you'll\n\n81\n00:04:52.013 --> 00:04:57.661\nactually be able to note if I click\non the little dropdown arrow.\n\n82\n00:04:57.661 --> 00:05:02.125\nWhat I'm looking for are a couple of\noptions that will probably be off here if\n\n83\n00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:04.236\nI, actually it's not showing up.\n\n84\n00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:08.960\nBut here's at least one option\nthat I need that is off.\n\n85\n00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.940\nNotice right here where it says Skype for\nBusiness PSTN Domestic Calling.\n\n86\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.750\nAnd if I bring that over, you'll see\nit's actually turned off right now.\n\n87\n00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.350\nAnd I have not purchased\nan additional license to give them.\n\n88\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.913\nSo I can't just turn it on here,\nand give him a license,\n\n89\n00:05:23.913 --> 00:05:27.254\ncuz that would add in something that\nI'm not authorized to do right now.\n\n90\n00:05:27.254 --> 00:05:28.550\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n91\n00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.910\n&gt;&gt; But overall, though,\nyou need at least that to be turned\n\n92\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.360\non if they're actually\ngoing to be communicating.\n\n93\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.410\nThe other feature, I'm trying to see\nif it's actually here, it's not part of\n\n94\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.770\nthe E3 account, so let me select Joey and\nshow you the other one here.\n\n95\n00:05:45.848 --> 00:05:49.709\nSo if I double-click on Joey's account,\nand\n\n96\n00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:53.080\ngo to Edit under the Product Licensing.\n\n97\n00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.385\nAnd expand out what features are on his,\nwe'll actually see if\n\n98\n00:06:01.385 --> 00:06:06.453\nI scroll down here the one that\nI'm looking for is right here.\n\n99\n00:06:06.453 --> 00:06:09.414\nSkype for Business Cloud PBX.\n\n100\n00:06:09.414 --> 00:06:17.130\nBy default, the E5 account has this\nCloud PBX for us to be able to use.\n\n101\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.880\nAnd you'll also notice Skype for\nBusiness PSTN Conferencing.\n\n102\n00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.540\nThat's different than the one\nthat we had down here and\n\n103\n00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.630\nyou'll see that this feature\nright here is actually turned on.\n\n104\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.710\nSo I have to have both of\nthose licensings to turn on.\n\n105\n00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.820\nSo even the E5, which is the most\nexpensive licensing that we have by\n\n106\n00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.980\ndefault, they won't be able to call out,\nokay?\n\n107\n00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.565\nIf they don't have this,\n\n108\n00:06:41.565 --> 00:06:46.795\nwhich is an additional charge that you'll\nadd on to add to their particular account.\n\n109\n00:06:46.795 --> 00:06:52.320\nNow what that gives you, though,\nis the ability to take advantage\n\n110\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.080\nof that cloud PBX system,\nthe Skype cloud PBX here.\n\n111\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.227\nThis is really that component,\nthat private branch exchange that says,\n\n112\n00:07:01.227 --> 00:07:02.149\nall right, Ronnie.\n\n113\n00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:07.190\nYou are gonna connect into the world out\nthere, but for you to do so, it also\n\n114\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.409\nmeans that you have to have a telephone\nnumber, you have to be able to do that.\n\n115\n00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:16.200\nAnd it gives you a whole\nbunch of other things too.\n\n116\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.670\nThat Skype or that Skype PBX there.\n\n117\n00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.640\nLet me scroll over here so\nthat you can see some of these features.\n\n118\n00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.250\nAnd this is why it's impressive,\nZach, is right here.\n\n119\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.730\nSo when you get this, and\nI have this link inside of the notes so\n\n120\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.980\ndon't worry if you're going like,\nI don't know if I have that or not.\n\n121\n00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.901\nYou'll actually be able to see it in your\naccount the way that I just showed you.\n\n122\n00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:38.942\nBut here, the PBX is a phone\nsystem within a business.\n\n123\n00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:41.694\nBut look at these features that you and\nI may take for\n\n124\n00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:43.870\ngranted right now that's not built in.\n\n125\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.386\nCall and answer by name and\nnumber, that seems normal, okay?\n\n126\n00:07:48.386 --> 00:07:51.383\nCall delegation, call on behalf of,\n\n127\n00:07:51.383 --> 00:07:55.886\nforward simultaneous ringing,\ncall history, holds.\n\n128\n00:07:55.886 --> 00:08:00.950\nCall transfer, Caller ID,\nchange status, Device switching.\n\n129\n00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.430\nEnables you to play your call or\nmeeting on another device if you have to.\n\n130\n00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.200\nDistinctive Ringing,\n\n131\n00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.470\nin other words creating your own\nringtones, Do-not-disturb routing.\n\n132\n00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.730\nSkype for Business using your desk\nphone for audio, okay, if you want to.\n\n133\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.080\nIntegrated dialing, Team calling,\nVideo calls, voicemail.\n\n134\n00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.950\nThat is a ton of features\nthat with E5 account,\n\n135\n00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.560\nyou just have,\nonce you have it set up, okay?\n\n136\n00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.350\nSo it's not something that you have\nto turn on piece meal, one at a time.\n\n137\n00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:36.440\nIf you have that Cloud PBX set up for\nyour system, you can actually do all this.\n\n138\n00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.372\nAnd it really does, once you integrate in\nan actual phone system handset with this,\n\n139\n00:08:41.372 --> 00:08:44.480\nyou have those features available to you.\n\n140\n00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.320\nTo be able to connect outside though,\n\n141\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.750\nyou also have to have that\nPSTN system set up as well.\n\n142\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.760\nSo once we verified that\nwe have those accounts\n\n143\n00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.910\nset up the way that\nwe've talked about here.\n\n144\n00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.010\nLet me see if I can zoom back up for\nus to see that, okay?\n\n145\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.390\nRemember that this is what you're\nlooking for, is right there, okay?\n\n146\n00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:10.640\nIf they don't have the one that\ngives them the Cloud PBX here,\n\n147\n00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.960\nwhich my E5 Enterprise does, Skype for\nBusiness Domestic Calling here.\n\n148\n00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.525\nIf you have the E3, you can add in the\nCloud for Business for a separate cost.\n\n149\n00:09:20.525 --> 00:09:24.260\nThen you can add the Skype for\nBusiness PSTN domestic calling.\n\n150\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.240\nThere's a domestic and there's also\na domestic and international calling, too.\n\n151\n00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.510\nJust depends on how much money\nyou're willing to spend.\n\n152\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.714\nBut you can do that per user, so this is\nnot something you enable globally for\n\n153\n00:09:35.714 --> 00:09:37.629\nyour organization a lot of times.\n\n154\n00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:43.810\nBecause not everybody needs a system\nthat should be able to do all that.\n\n155\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.040\nSo for example like me,\nI don't have a telephone number here.\n\n156\n00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.480\nBut we do have people right\nhere on ITProTV staff,\n\n157\n00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.540\nthat they definitely need to have\na phone that they use every single day.\n\n158\n00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.286\nI'm not one of those guys, so\nI don't have any Skype for\n\n159\n00:09:57.286 --> 00:10:00.741\nBusiness domestic calling plan,\nI don't have access to any of that.\n\n160\n00:10:00.741 --> 00:10:06.380\nAnd I don't mind, cuz I really don't like\ntaking phone calls to tell you the truth.\n\n161\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.940\nBut at the least here,\n\n162\n00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.470\nwe do know that that actually\ncan be where we assign that up.\n\n163\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.065\nAnd that makes it cheaper, in other words,\n\n164\n00:10:13.065 --> 00:10:17.540\nit's a competitive pricing model that\nSkype for Business is really offering.\n\n165\n00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.190\nIt's saying look, take all these features,\ncompare it to another system out there.\n\n166\n00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.820\nAnd see if they'll give you the same\nthing, where you put it for\n\n167\n00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.800\nas many people as you want to.\n\n168\n00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.526\nSo here, I'm not having to actually say,\nall right,\n\n169\n00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:32.509\nthis guy says I can do it as long\nas I have five accounts here.\n\n170\n00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:36.850\nThis is what they're gonna charge me for,\nwell, I only had it for two.\n\n171\n00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:42.010\nSo if I add that up, Skype for Business,\nor at least Office 365 is running.\n\n172\n00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.830\nYou can set up your own PBX, your own\ndomestic calling plan for two people.\n\n173\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.800\nI mean imagine that,\nthat's for a business.\n\n174\n00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.620\nAnd then if I add in a third one,\nthey just continue to bill me.\n\n175\n00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.104\nWhereas I might have to begin with,\n\n176\n00:10:53.104 --> 00:10:55.330\nthis guy says I have to set\nup ten of these numbers.\n\n177\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.380\nI have to be able to do all that,\nbut I don't have ten people.\n\n178\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.880\nI am gonna have it in the future, but I\nstill have to pay for it until that point.\n\n179\n00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.800\nThey're saying no, let's do this\ncompetitively here and make it work.\n\n180\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.160\nBut if they don't have either one\nof those accounts actually tied, or\n\n181\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.350\nthe subscription tied in,\nthey won't be able to do this, okay?\n\n182\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.340\nSo that's key, so once that's done.\n\n183\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.170\nThen, we can begin to take\na look at verifying and\n\n184\n00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.210\nsetting this up as well, okay?\n\n185\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.606\nNow, there comes a point though\nsince I actually did this today,\n\n186\n00:11:25.606 --> 00:11:27.660\nthere is a little bit of a latency here.\n\n187\n00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.330\nSo let me go back into the Skype for\nBusiness.\n\n188\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.280\nAnd I'll show you what I'm talking about.\n\n189\n00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.150\nWith that PSTN domestic calling turned\non and the Cloud PBX turned on.\n\n190\n00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.130\nWe now have to go into Skype for\nBusiness Admin Center.\n\n191\n00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.790\nAnd once we get in to the Skype for\nBusiness Admin Center, we can begin\n\n192\n00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:51.010\nsetting up every user that we want to,\nto now be able to take voice calls.\n\n193\n00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:59.020\nSo now if I select voice here, I now need\nto get phone numbers is what I need to do.\n\n194\n00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:04.380\nSo this is where it becomes, again,\nlike you're going to a telephone company.\n\n195\n00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.350\nSaying, I'm setting up my phone service,\nand I need some phone numbers.\n\n196\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.640\nWell, it's right here that\nyou can actually do that.\n\n197\n00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.358\nOnce that PSTN is turned on, you can now\ngo and pick the state that you're in.\n\n198\n00:12:17.358 --> 00:12:22.218\nAnd even a city or location that\nyou're actually in to be able to\n\n199\n00:12:22.218 --> 00:12:26.820\nadd in additional phones or\nphone numbers to do this.\n\n200\n00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.840\nNow the problem that I have is simple.\n\n201\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.660\nNotice that even though I've turned\nthis on, it says right here,\n\n202\n00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:40.350\nyou don't have a PSTN calling license\nto acquire a new user number.\n\n203\n00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:45.050\nWhat you saw, I have 2 that\nabsolutely have been turned on.\n\n204\n00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:50.420\nAnd that is because, once you turn\nthem on, it can take up to 24 hours,\n\n205\n00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.685\nagain, before this is enabled.\n\n206\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.320\nSo, it's right here where we\n\n207\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.440\nhave a stopping point in terms of\nthe demonstration, that we're gonna do.\n\n208\n00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.040\nWe're gonna pick this\nup in a future episode.\n\n209\n00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.710\nSo, I'm not gonna leave everybody hanging,\nbut\n\n210\n00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.730\nyou will see it in a future episode here,\nthat we'll be doing.\n\n211\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.460\nWhere we'll actually show you the end\nresult of this configuration.\n\n212\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.900\nBut, that doesn't mean\nthat I have to stop.\n\n213\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.590\nBut, what I can show you though is that\nnotice that there is already a conversing\n\n214\n00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.500\nbridge right here.\n\n215\n00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.269\nAnd that means that I can setup\nanother type of phone number.\n\n216\n00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:28.243\nIf I click on this, here's the end\nresult that I'm getting right now.\n\n217\n00:13:28.243 --> 00:13:32.750\nBecause the licensing has not yet kind of\npropagated through everything it needs to.\n\n218\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.022\nSays you don't have a PSTN Calling\nlicense to acquire new User numbers.\n\n219\n00:13:37.022 --> 00:13:40.551\nI can buy an additional license, but\neven if I did, it's not gonna show up for\n\n220\n00:13:40.551 --> 00:13:42.070\nanother 24 hours.\n\n221\n00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.580\nBut notice this option where it\nsays get new service numbers.\n\n222\n00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.250\nGet phone numbers to assign to services,\n\n223\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.190\nsuch as a conference bridge,\nthat can handle simultaneous calls.\n\n224\n00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.370\nYou'll kind of see it will be similar.\n\n225\n00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:58.102\nSo I'm gonna select this just to\nshow you part of the result of what\n\n226\n00:13:58.102 --> 00:14:01.125\nwe can have if everything comes through.\n\n227\n00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:04.470\nBut it is a little bit slow,\nonce we get to this point, there we go.\n\n228\n00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.070\nThis is what I wanted to show you.\n\n229\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.334\nWhat we would normally see is something\njust a little bit different here in terms\n\n230\n00:14:09.334 --> 00:14:10.463\nof not the service number.\n\n231\n00:14:10.463 --> 00:14:13.990\nBut it would probably be the personal\nnumber that we're talking about.\n\n232\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:19.760\nAnd then it's here that you can say hey,\nwhat state or what region that you're in.\n\n233\n00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.650\nOf course select your particular state,\nso let's say I'm here in Florida.\n\n234\n00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.760\nAnd then I can select,\nthere it is, I'm in Gainesville.\n\n235\n00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:34.400\nNow, it's saying that,\nat this point for my licensing, that's\n\n236\n00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.910\nsaying I can actually acquire how many\nnumbers for this type of conferencing.\n\n237\n00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:45.080\nI can select 4, and\nif I now click Add here.\n\n238\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.640\nWe'll see in a moment,\nlet me see if I can scroll down here.\n\n239\n00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.720\nIf I select Show, I'm not going\nto acquire these numbers yet.\n\n240\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.730\nBut you can see that I'm gonna\nhave them assign these four\n\n241\n00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.260\ndifferent telephone numbers right now,\nokay?\n\n242\n00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.580\nThat's what I did,\nI would select acquire, and\n\n243\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.080\nthat would now assign those numbers to me.\n\n244\n00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.508\nIt is just like I went to\na telephone company and said,\n\n245\n00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:07.773\nI need four additional numbers.\n\n246\n00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:09.890\nAnd they're qactually\nassigning those numbers and\n\n247\n00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.030\nthey should be unique to what I need.\n\n248\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.494\nNow, for me though, if this was personal,\nit would actually now be assigned.\n\n249\n00:15:15.494 --> 00:15:19.920\nAnd then I would pick the user account\nof who's gonna get that number as well.\n\n250\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.770\nBut, for right now, that's what we have.\n\n251\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.330\nNow notice that over here\non the right-hand side,\n\n252\n00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.130\nten minutes left to acquire the numbers.\n\n253\n00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.677\nThey do not hold these numbers for\nlong, Zack.\n\n254\n00:15:30.677 --> 00:15:33.688\nThere's such a high demand for\nthis numbers.\n\n255\n00:15:33.688 --> 00:15:38.560\nThey're not gonna give me a real\nlong time to decide whether or\n\n256\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.892\nnot I want these numbers or not.\n\n257\n00:15:39.892 --> 00:15:44.140\nThey're saying, in ten minutes I'm\ngoing to yank them back from you.\n\n258\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.361\nAnd I'll show you a different\nset of numbers at this point.\n\n259\n00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:52.189\nSo just kind of realize that you may get\nthe numbers that you'd like to get, but\n\n260\n00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:53.004\nyou may not.\n\n261\n00:15:53.004 --> 00:15:56.935\nThere is also a chance, so\nI'm going to cancel this.\n\n262\n00:15:56.935 --> 00:16:02.710\nYou, Yes let me leave that page cause I\ndon't really want to get that number.\n\n263\n00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.230\nI really wanna get\nthe personal numbers but\n\n264\n00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.500\nsince we are not showing up for right now.\n\n265\n00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.300\nBut you can at least see kind of the next\nresult in that process at what we'll\n\n266\n00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.830\ndo, okay.\n\n267\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.410\nOnce you have that,\nthat's what will end up happening,\n\n268\n00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.290\nNow there's a way that you\ncan port numbers over.\n\n269\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.750\nSo let's say for an example that\nyou've had your telephone number for\n\n270\n00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.090\nthe last 20 years.\n\n271\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.990\nOkay, let's say that,\nthat's your telephone number.\n\n272\n00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.960\nYou've had that bank of numbers.\n\n273\n00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.330\nWhat you know, I want these numbers.\n\n274\n00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:34.765\nThey do give you an option to port those\nnumbers, even into Office 365 too.\n\n275\n00:16:34.765 --> 00:16:36.910\nThat's a little bit beyond\nwhat we're doing here today.\n\n276\n00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:41.380\nBut it is possible that as long as\nthey can verify that those numbers\n\n277\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.050\nare actually assigned to you,\nthen they can port those things in.\n\n278\n00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.960\nAnd that means that you don't even have to\nchange your phone numbers to give people.\n\n279\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.830\nNot having to change business cards or\ncompany logo head on stationery,\n\n280\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.170\nwhatever it might be.\n\n281\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.910\nIt's gonna actually allow you\nto take those numbers with you.\n\n282\n00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.940\nAnd now, someone says,\nyou switched over, do you need?\n\n283\n00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.090\nNope, same number will still work.\n\n284\n00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.020\nAnd it should actually work for us.\n\n285\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.620\nSo, getting all that stuff in place,\nit really is helpful.\n\n286\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.220\nAnd I don't have to buy\na piece of equipment, okay.\n\n287\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.180\nI don't actually have to\nget anybody to come in and\n\n288\n00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:17.390\nset up my own PBX system which will\ntake up a good portion of the wall and\n\n289\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.010\nmake sure all the phones are connected and\nworking.\n\n290\n00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.460\nIt is just as simple as assigning\nthese numbers right here but\n\n291\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.930\nwe will finish this configuration\nlike I said in the future episode.\n\n292\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:27.630\nSo if your are going,\n\n293\n00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.890\nI really need to see that piece, just hang\non through the rest of this episode and\n\n294\n00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:36.930\ntry the following episode that we'll do,\nafter this one in the next section.\n\n295\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.450\nYou'll see that we'll pick it up cuz\nthat will actually give us the time\n\n296\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.200\nthat we'll need before\neverything populates in.\n\n297\n00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.540\nThis is also a great point about planning,\ntoo.\n\n298\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.940\nWe don't wanna go I'm gonna\nget all new numbers and\n\n299\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.460\neverybody just wait until this afternoon.\n\n300\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.920\nIt's not gonna work that way.\n\n301\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.500\nOnce again plan it out and go hey, it's\ngonna take at a least a day before I get\n\n302\n00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:02.130\nnew numbers so let's go ahead and\nmake sure that we know when we're going to\n\n303\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:06.510\nrequest these numbers or get as many\nas you can right at the beginning.\n\n304\n00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.380\nAnd request them and say in about a day or\nso, I'll be able to assign these out.\n\n305\n00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.250\nBut at this point, I can't.\n\n306\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.290\nSo just kinda make sure that\nwe think about that idea of\n\n307\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.920\nplanning once we do something like this,\ntoo.\n\n308\n00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.270\nSo that's actually something\nthat is a good thing for us.\n\n309\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.300\nRemember, without the licensing,\nit's not going to work.\n\n310\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.030\nWithout having the time to\nassign those licenses, and\n\n311\n00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.190\nthen get them updated here,\nwe won't get it implemented either.\n\n312\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.000\nSo it's taking a little bit of time,\na little bit of patience, but\n\n313\n00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.220\nonce that happens, we'll be fine and dandy\nand it will begin to work for us too.\n\n314\n00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.900\nThe other thing that we also\nwant to get in too then\n\n315\n00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.300\nis the idea of conferencing, okay?\n\n316\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.070\nConferencing is exactly like it sounds.\n\n317\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:53.130\nWhere we set up meetings\njust like a teleconference.\n\n318\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.590\nBut not everybody in your organization\nneeds to have the ability to do so.\n\n319\n00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.460\nSo, this is one of those systems where\nif we take a look at the licensing.\n\n320\n00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.940\nLet me see if I can get us to that point.\n\n321\n00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.959\nAlso like Joey's instances is right here.\n\n322\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.230\nAnd click Edit.\n\n323\n00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.970\nOn any of the licensing and\nthis is where it takes time for\n\n324\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.400\nyou to learn the licensing or\nthe subscription model that you have.\n\n325\n00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:26.830\nWhat we're looking for\nis this option here, okay.\n\n326\n00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:27.550\nThe Skype for\n\n327\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:33.280\nBusiness PSTN Conferencing, now that's\na part of the E5 license by default.\n\n328\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.890\nIf you go look,\nJoey doesn't really need that,\n\n329\n00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:42.220\nyou simply put it over here and\nnow that turns off that feature.\n\n330\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.338\nHe will not be able to actually allow or\nto actually create a conference call.\n\n331\n00:19:46.338 --> 00:19:50.700\nSome people will need it,\nnot everybody needs it.\n\n332\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.540\nAnd that just kind of reduces down some\nof the extra clutter that you might\n\n333\n00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.540\nactually have.\n\n334\n00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.620\nSo you also wanna make sure\nthat you think about that.\n\n335\n00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.825\nIf you do have more people that need this,\n\n336\n00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:05.365\nmake sure that you understand that you'll\nhave to purchase additional licensing for\n\n337\n00:20:05.365 --> 00:20:08.973\nthose accounts that don't have this\nfeature to be able to run that.\n\n338\n00:20:08.973 --> 00:20:12.293\nAnd once you have that,\nyou'll be ready to go, so\n\n339\n00:20:12.293 --> 00:20:16.642\nthere is no a lot that you really\nhave to do because by default on all\n\n340\n00:20:16.642 --> 00:20:21.960\nthe subscriptions that have this\nfeature available it's on, okay?\n\n341\n00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.170\nBut, it doesn't mean that everybody\nneeds it, so that means that for\n\n342\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.920\nthe majority of people,\nyou can probably turn it off and\n\n343\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.250\nit won't effect them at all and\nyou're probably good with that system.\n\n344\n00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.880\nSo there's no real configuration here\n\n345\n00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.870\nthat we really need to take\ncare of in that sense.\n\n346\n00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.666\nYou just need to know, if you need it,\n\n347\n00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:42.100\nverify that it's on,\nif you don't need it, turn it off.\n\n348\n00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.930\nAnd that's probably the easiest way for\npeople not to accidentally start\n\n349\n00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:50.650\nteleconferencing everybody that they\nactually talked to on the phone too, okay.\n\n350\n00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.200\nSo, that's kind of the two big two or\n\n351\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:01.890\nthe three big types of communications\nthat we can have without you or\n\n352\n00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.870\nwith people that don't have Skype for\nBusiness cuz, I'm trying\n\n353\n00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:10.290\nto figure out how to word that there, for\nthose people that are external, yeah.\n\n354\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.810\n&gt;&gt; So, maybe we can wrap\nup this episode this way.\n\n355\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.640\nWhat is a Skype Meeting Broadcast?\n\n356\n00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.060\n&gt;&gt; That's actually another way that\nwe can also communicate with users\n\n357\n00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.590\nthat don't have Skype for Business too.\n\n358\n00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:30.640\nSkype for Meeting Broadcast is actually\nsomething that's very much a powerful tool\n\n359\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.160\nthat we can have access to and\n\n360\n00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:39.370\nbe able to deliver out a message that we\nwant to to up to 10,000 users at one time,\n\n361\n00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.960\nregardless of whether they have Skype for\nBusiness or not.\n\n362\n00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.120\nAnd that is because of built-in\nwith the Skype for Business, and\n\n363\n00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:51.560\nthe video that we have here in Office 365,\nin the background of it,\n\n364\n00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.750\nthere is what we call the Azure CDN,\nthe content delivery network.\n\n365\n00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:03.020\nAnd that is designed to be a very high\npower, high speed network designed for\n\n366\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.140\nvideo transmissions and to be able\nto stream and to do all that stuff.\n\n367\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:12.240\nThe idea of a Skype type of broadcast or\nmeeting broadcast\n\n368\n00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:18.020\nallows us to be able to schedule\nthese types of events if we want to,\n\n369\n00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.960\nto actually produce\nan event if we wanted to.\n\n370\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.200\nSo if Zach said I have\nthis brand new product\n\n371\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.350\nI want to be able to actually make this,\nbut I need some investors.\n\n372\n00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:33.430\nLet me invite 5,000 people I wanna hand\nchoose these guys that would really\n\n373\n00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:38.780\nbe invested in this and he can produce\nthe content that he wants to produce.\n\n374\n00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.330\nHe can produce video shorts,\n\n375\n00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.800\nif he wants to, he can add in\nPowerPoint slides if he chooses too.\n\n376\n00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.340\nHe can add in notes and product offering\ndetails, he can do all that stuff where,\n\n377\n00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:52.060\npeople go let me download that and\nso that I can see all that.\n\n378\n00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.660\nAnd at the same time be talking to\neverybody in a live broadcast too, okay.\n\n379\n00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.600\nIt really gives that ability, that if I\nknow that there's something important that\n\n380\n00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.810\nI wanna do this,\nI have the ability to do so, okay.\n\n381\n00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:10.110\nSo by being able to produce something\nlike this, that audience of up to 10,000.\n\n382\n00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:14.140\nThere comes a point, and I don't know\nguys that are working there know why this\n\n383\n00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:17.750\nhappens here, but there comes\na point after like 10,000 or so\n\n384\n00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:22.960\nusers that it's not really fair in terms\nof quality that they can offer for\n\n385\n00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.940\neverybody that's trying to do this.\n\n386\n00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.430\nSo they have let's say 10,000,\n100,000, maybe even half a million\n\n387\n00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:34.680\ncustomers Office 365 has and they all have\nthe ability to do something like this.\n\n388\n00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.490\nWell, they're saying around 10,000\nusers they wanted to broadcast.\n\n389\n00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.542\nAfterward, every company wants to do that.\n\n390\n00:23:40.542 --> 00:23:45.148\nWe can't offer good quality video and\naudio and everything that we wanna offer\n\n391\n00:23:45.148 --> 00:23:48.379\nif we go above that mark for\none particular broadcast.\n\n392\n00:23:48.379 --> 00:23:51.362\nSo let's limit it at 10,000.\n\n393\n00:23:51.362 --> 00:23:53.831\nIs what essentially ends up happening,\nokay.\n\n394\n00:23:53.831 --> 00:23:57.499\nNow if we wanted to set something like\nthat up, that's great, that's fine, and\n\n395\n00:23:57.499 --> 00:23:58.960\nwe can show you how to do that.\n\n396\n00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.741\nSo, let's go and take a look here.\n\n397\n00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:04.752\nInside of the office admin center, we're\ngoing to of course, go back to Skype for\n\n398\n00:24:04.752 --> 00:24:05.345\nbusiness.\n\n399\n00:24:09.516 --> 00:24:11.624\nAnd once we get connected in.\n\n400\n00:24:11.624 --> 00:24:14.250\nI probably should have left it there,\nthat's what I do.\n\n401\n00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:19.050\nNotice that there is this connection for\nonline meetings.\n\n402\n00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.153\nAnd we selected,\nwe talk as invitation meeting,\n\n403\n00:24:23.153 --> 00:24:27.609\nand I was very careful trying to make sure\nthat I ignored the broadcast meeting.\n\n404\n00:24:27.609 --> 00:24:29.960\nBut it's right over here\nunder broadcast meeting.\n\n405\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.180\nAnd in broadcast meeting,\n\n406\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.460\nhere are some of the settings\nthat we want to be able to see.\n\n407\n00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.970\nYou can change an organization setting for\nSkype meeting broadcast,\n\n408\n00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.610\nservice that which allows thousands of\nattendees to join a single meeting.\n\n409\n00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.120\nSo here it,\nif you want to start you own cult, Zach.\n\n410\n00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.772\nHere's how you start\nyour own internet cult.\n\n411\n00:24:50.772 --> 00:24:52.140\n&gt;&gt; The cult of Zack.\n\n412\n00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.212\n&gt;&gt; There you go, the cult of Zack.\n\n413\n00:24:53.212 --> 00:24:56.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; Meeting set and access policy is here.\n\n414\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.060\nFirst, of course,\n\n415\n00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.760\nif you wanna do it it has to be\nenabled [LAUGH] that makes sense.\n\n416\n00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.350\nI hope it makes sense\nthat has to be enabled.\n\n417\n00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.640\nAllow organizers to schedule\nanonymous meetings.\n\n418\n00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.300\nWell, if you want people\nto be able to come in,\n\n419\n00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.330\nand you don't know\neverybody that's coming in.\n\n420\n00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.070\nYou can do this where you're saying,\nlook I just wanna open this up, but\n\n421\n00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.510\nI wanna extend an invitation out there.\n\n422\n00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.400\nWe can do it.\n\n423\n00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.210\nAllow meetings to be recorded.\n\n424\n00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.610\nThere is another great feature, right.\n\n425\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.559\nThe ability to stream and record, sounds\nlike something I know at ITProTV for\n\n426\n00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:25.845\nsome reason or another.\n\n427\n00:25:25.845 --> 00:25:28.408\nNow, there you go,\nsomething very similar, right.\n\n428\n00:25:28.408 --> 00:25:31.295\nSo you do have that feature and\nit's available for\n\n429\n00:25:31.295 --> 00:25:34.390\nyou right there as you\nchoose that to add in.\n\n430\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.140\nAnd once again,\n\n431\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:41.760\nit's on by default is what we do end up\nseeing here to be able to do something.\n\n432\n00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.780\nNow once that happens, right,\nthis does give you that ability.\n\n433\n00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.560\nIt's not that you can't do it.\n\n434\n00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.399\nIt does take a little bit of time\nto figure out what your polished\n\n435\n00:25:51.399 --> 00:25:52.536\nend product is gonna be.\n\n436\n00:25:52.536 --> 00:25:54.241\nSo just kind to realize and,\n\n437\n00:25:54.241 --> 00:25:58.400\nmake sure you go through this\nlearn more link over here, okay?\n\n438\n00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:04.100\nSo that you can actually figure out like,\nhow can I fully take advantage of this?\n\n439\n00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.570\nIt's not part of the exam or\nanything, but this is great reading.\n\n440\n00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:12.510\nIf somebody said man, I really do\nwish that we could show the world\n\n441\n00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.140\nthe product that we're\nworking on right now.\n\n442\n00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.920\nAnd to be able to do this.\n\n443\n00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.740\nWell, you can say, hey, look,\nwe're already running Skype for Business.\n\n444\n00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.010\nWe have this platform,\n\n445\n00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:26.640\nwe can invite up to 10,000 users to\nactually view what you're talking about.\n\n446\n00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.930\nAre you ready to try and get that set up?\n\n447\n00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.230\nThis is the link that's gonna help you\nto figure out how to do that best.\n\n448\n00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.650\nSo make sure you know that.\n\n449\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.020\nNow, like everything else Zach, right?\n\n450\n00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.180\n&gt;&gt; We can connect through PowerShell.\n\n451\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.250\n&gt;&gt; We can connect through PowerShell.\n\n452\n00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.400\nAnd like everything else on the exam,\n\n453\n00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.260\nyou have to know how to\nconnect through PowerShell.\n\n454\n00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.360\nSo, that means we're gonna spend kinda\nthe last few minutes here taking a look,\n\n455\n00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.670\nof course, at the PowerShell connection.\n\n456\n00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.830\nSo let me make sure I'm\nstill connected here.\n\n457\n00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:59.680\nPS Session, verify that I'm still\non Microsoft PowerShell for\n\n458\n00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.570\nSkype for Business, available,\nopened, looks good.\n\n459\n00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:08.210\nAnd that means we are ready to take\na look at what we need here for\n\n460\n00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.280\nthis idea of this broadcast, right?\n\n461\n00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:19.500\nI need to get cs Broadcast\nmeeting configuration.\n\n462\n00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.830\nIf I press enter here I should\nget where it tells me here it is,\n\n463\n00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:27.120\nhere is my global policy which\nmeans this is the default one.\n\n464\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.620\nAnd right now I have all of these\nthat are actually right here.\n\n465\n00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.983\nAvailable, so enable broadcast\nmeeting which is true, that's good,\n\n466\n00:27:35.983 --> 00:27:37.990\nopen broadcast meeting, True.\n\n467\n00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:43.900\nEnable broadcast recording, and\nthen enable anonymous broadcast meeting.\n\n468\n00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.900\nAll that is actually True in\nthe way that we want it to be.\n\n469\n00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:54.310\nIf I want to change this to where that's\nnot going to happen I can then set CS\n\n470\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.846\nbroadcast meeting configuration then\ninstead I could set this one to\n\n471\n00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:05.900\nfalse here as well.\n\n472\n00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.620\nActually I need to set,\njust need to do False.\n\n473\n00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:16.087\nI need to do enable\nThe broadcast meeting so\n\n474\n00:28:16.087 --> 00:28:20.580\nthat would have led me to a wrong,\nthere we go.\n\n475\n00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:26.002\nEnable broadcast meeting, $, fault.\n\n476\n00:28:26.002 --> 00:28:28.040\nSometimes I get a little\nbit ahead of myself.\n\n477\n00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.620\nNow we can see right here at\nthe bottom where we're saying take that\n\n478\n00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.290\nfirst option here.\n\n479\n00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.844\nRight, the Enable Broadcast Meeting\n[INAUDIBLE] set the True,\n\n480\n00:28:37.844 --> 00:28:39.730\nyou can now set this one to False.\n\n481\n00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:47.841\nNow let me zoom out so I can click on it,\n\n482\n00:28:47.841 --> 00:28:51.078\nmaybe, [LAUGH] sometimes,\n\n483\n00:28:54.019 --> 00:28:57.830\nThere we go it's like it challenges me,\nright.\n\n484\n00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.950\nIs this saying like,\nyeah you're not gonna do that.\n\n485\n00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.670\nNow I'm gonna try and get this and\nas far as a confirmation, so\n\n486\n00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.840\nwe can simply turn that off.\n\n487\n00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.240\nIf I turn that off in the general setting,\nthe rest of these are probably not\n\n488\n00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.620\ngoing to work since I won't be able to\nactually enable the broadcast meeting.\n\n489\n00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.630\nI'm not gonna be able to open a broadcast\nmeeting and all the rest just won't work.\n\n490\n00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:23.080\nBut if you do get paranoid,\nyou can always add in those dashes for\n\n491\n00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.190\neach one of those and\nturn each one of those off as well.\n\n492\n00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:31.980\nSo here are some of those settings that we\ncan actually be able to do if we want to.\n\n493\n00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.940\nThe only other thing that we have\nto be able to do of course then\n\n494\n00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.950\nis if we want to,\nespecially on a broadcast,\n\n495\n00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.770\nwe have to take a look at our\nfirewall settings once again.\n\n496\n00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:47.740\nYou're gonna go back to that same URL\nthat I showed you earlier in the show.\n\n497\n00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.950\nAnd if you do that,\n\n498\n00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:53.800\nthat will also of course allow you to\nadd in what you need for the broadcast\n\n499\n00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.010\nsettings that are actually out there that\nyou may need to take advantage of too.\n\n500\n00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:00.698\nIf you're having an issue in other words\nyou know that everything is working\n\n501\n00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:01.204\ninternally.\n\n502\n00:30:01.204 --> 00:30:04.660\nAnd then you try and connect your laptop,\nlet's say to a guest network and\n\n503\n00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.710\nyou can't get into that broadcast.\n\n504\n00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.660\nThat will kind of let you know you're\nprobably actually dealing with a firewall\n\n505\n00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.770\nissue too.\n\n506\n00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.620\nSo just make sure you pay attention\nto a lot of those configurations.\n\n507\n00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.330\nBut there it is, we've shown you now,\nnot only of course in the web UI.\n\n508\n00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.920\nBut also in the PowerShell\nhow we can get Skype for\n\n509\n00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.440\nBusiness to not only\nconnect to everything else.\n\n510\n00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.780\nBut now even to those users\nthat don't have Skype or\n\n511\n00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.600\nSkype for Business working in their\nown businesses

You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and\n\n5\n00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:16.000\ngentleman, to your 70-347 series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.270\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.570\nIn this episode, we'll take a look at how\nto configure advanced threat protection.\n\n8\n00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.760\nAnd with this today in studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.780\nThanks for joining us, Ronnie,\n\n10\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.129\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine, Cherokee, thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:34.367\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue in our 70-347 series.\n\n12\n00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.234\nUpdating some of those exam\nobjectives that have changed.\n\n13\n00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:39.226\nAnd there's something\nthat we need to get into,\n\n14\n00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.120\nwhich of course is the idea of\nadvanced threat protection.\n\n15\n00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.815\nNow Cherokee, when we start talking about\nthe idea of advanced threat protection,\n\n16\n00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:49.407\nhopefully there's only one question that\ncomes to your mind if you haven't heard\n\n17\n00:00:49.407 --> 00:00:52.156\nabout it before, which is?\n&gt;&gt; What is advanced threat protection?\n\n18\n00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:54.730\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah, I mean, who knows?\n\n19\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.350\nBut that is actually a cool thing\nthat we have available to us\n\n20\n00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.870\nas Office 365 subscribers.\n\n21\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.380\nNow, before I get into that, right,\nwhere do I find it, how do I get to it?\n\n22\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.560\nI know those are all questions\nthat we'll be answering here.\n\n23\n00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.820\nBut when it comes down to it,\n\n24\n00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.460\nright, the way that we've always\ntreated in things like security, right.\n\n25\n00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.970\nAnd security in the past year or so\nhas really moved to the forefront of just\n\n26\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.490\nabout all of IT in every area\nthat you can think about.\n\n27\n00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.340\nIt doesn't matter, security is\npretty much at the forefront, and\n\n28\n00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.270\nthe reason why, of course, is that there's\njust so many different types of attacks.\n\n29\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.830\nAnd we're losing information\nin different ways, and\n\n30\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.560\nwe have to protect against them better\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n31\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.990\nRonnie, just historically knowing that,\nand probably you've heard this too.\n\n32\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.950\nHey, we're not gonna be running more\nthan one type of antimalware software on\n\n33\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.020\nmy system.\n\n34\n00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.010\nSo just hearing advanced\nthreat protection,\n\n35\n00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.390\nI'm kind of curious to see\nwhere we're headed with this.\n\n36\n00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.635\nIs this in lieu of something\nlike Windows Defender or\n\n37\n00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:59.090\nthird-party software,\nin addition to, does it conflict?\n\n38\n00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.490\nSo lots of questions here, and\n\n39\n00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.720\nso I guess, where's a good place to start?\n&gt;&gt; When you start thinking about questions\n\n40\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.210\nlike that, that's actually a great place\nto start and start to talk about, right?\n\n41\n00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.250\nDoes that mean we don't have to run\nsomething like Windows Defender anymore,\n\n42\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.590\nor any type of antimalware and\nantiviral type of software on my computer?\n\n43\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.610\nNot necessarily, but\n\n44\n00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.620\nyou've gotta remember that computing has\nchanged over the past several years.\n\n45\n00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.170\nMost of us stay inside of\na corporate organization.\n\n46\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.630\nWe're not just running software that's\nmanaged only internally anymore.\n\n47\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.610\nAnd it's because Office 365 essentially\nis a cloud platform for us.\n\n48\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.910\nAnd we are connecting from our own\nmachines, which we do tend to run\n\n49\n00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.605\nantimalware of some sort and antiviral\nsoftware, to protect our own machines.\n\n50\n00:02:45.605 --> 00:02:49.157\nWell, what happens when we\nconnect out to the cloud, but\n\n51\n00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:51.602\nwe still need that type of protection?\n\n52\n00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:56.040\nAnd this is where the advanced\nthreat protection really comes in.\n\n53\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.678\nIt really bridges the gap that we\nhave where things are actually\n\n54\n00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.689\njust protected in the cloud, and\nthey're protected on your machine.\n\n55\n00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.894\nWell, what about the in between points,\nand\n\n56\n00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:06.691\nwhat about other things that\nactually end up happening?\n\n57\n00:03:06.691 --> 00:03:10.041\nSo advanced threat protection\nreally takes a look at it, and\n\n58\n00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:13.537\nit really does center around\nemail at the very beginning here.\n\n59\n00:03:13.537 --> 00:03:17.021\nBecause that's still kind\nof the communication,\n\n60\n00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:22.830\nthe blood of most organizations in terms\nof communication is really email, right?\n\n61\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.618\nIf email stops, and we've said it again\nover and over again even in this series,\n\n62\n00:03:26.618 --> 00:03:28.746\nand just about every\nseries I've ever done.\n\n63\n00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:31.573\nIs that if you wanna get people upset,\nprinters and\n\n64\n00:03:31.573 --> 00:03:32.531\nemails.\n&gt;&gt;

And I can only imagine that in the near\n\n115\n00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:19.983\nfuture, sometime in the future, we might\neven see yet another evolution here.\n\n116\n00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:24.894\nOr maybe some kind of merging or\nrenaming or restructuring of\n\n117\n00:06:24.894 --> 00:06:29.690\nthis process as things change and grow.\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt\n\n118\n00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.230\nthat when we deal with cloud technology,\n\n119\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.790\nit has changed even since Office\n365 kind of really got it started.\n\n120\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.770\nAlmost like a decade ago now\nwhen we really started seeing\n\n121\n00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.660\npeople move towards it.\n\n122\n00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.670\nThe very fact is, now things\nare changing so quickly, we're gonna see\n\n123\n00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.050\nthe changing of naming conventions\nprobably quite often by comparison.\n\n124\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.340\nSo it could be where if you're watching\nthis episode even later on in the future,\n\n125\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.450\nyou're going, there is no security and\ncompliance center anymore, Ronnie,\n\n126\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.960\nI can't believe that you did that.\n\n127\n00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.894\nWell it might be where they really did\njust change it, just like we did for\n\n128\n00:07:05.894 --> 00:07:07.262\nthe update of this show.\n\n129\n00:07:07.262 --> 00:07:09.385\nWhere even though they had security and\ncompliance center,\n\n130\n00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:11.210\nit didn't actually manage all of that.\n\n131\n00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.822\nSome stuff that was updated,\nwhich was updated in June of 2017, and\n\n132\n00:07:15.822 --> 00:07:20.739\nwas actually, again, changed and\numbrellaed underneath that security and\n\n133\n00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:24.087\ncompliance center,\nonly in November of 2017.\n\n134\n00:07:24.087 --> 00:07:27.891\nSo even months after they added it to\nthe exam objectives, they said, look,\n\n135\n00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:31.350\nwe're now actually changing\nthat product a little bit more.\n\n136\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.627\nSo you may see where you're still going to\nsome of those separate products to do some\n\n137\n00:07:35.627 --> 00:07:38.085\nof the management, and\nyou can do some of that.\n\n138\n00:07:38.085 --> 00:07:41.900\nAnd then of course, that means you also\nneed to learn about the new stuff.\n\n139\n00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.014\nI wish I could tell you they're\nabandoning that old way of doing things,\n\n140\n00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:48.128\nand you only have to worry about\nthe security and compliance center, but\n\n141\n00:07:48.128 --> 00:07:49.166\nI can't tell you that.\n\n142\n00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:53.385\nFor all we know, you're gonna get a mix of\nquestions from when it happened before,\n\n143\n00:07:53.385 --> 00:07:57.021\nas well as a mix of questions from\nwhen it actually changed afterwards.\n\n144\n00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:59.824\nSo you need to know about both of them,\nand there's no other way for\n\n145\n00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:02.443\nme to tell you that than just to say,\nyou've got to know both.\n\n146\n00:08:02.443 --> 00:08:04.192\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, as of today,\n\n147\n00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:07.470\nthis moment in time,\nwhere can I actually get ATP?\n\n148\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.741\nI almost said ATM, but\nwe talked about that before.\n\n149\n00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:09.829\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah,\n\n153\n00:08:14.816 --> 00:08:19.043\nI find it neat that that's what came to\nyour mind first, America's Top Model.\n\n154\n00:08:19.043 --> 00:08:23.312\nFor me, it was the ATM, the cash machine\nis what actually came to my mind, but\n\n155\n00:08:23.312 --> 00:08:25.834\noverall though, yes, where can we find it?\n\n156\n00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:28.320\nWell, this is where it becomes\na little bit trickier.\n\n157\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.965\nIt actually depends on your\nown subcription to Office 365.\n\n158\n00:08:32.965 --> 00:08:36.367\nSo, in other words, if you have,\nlet's say, for an example,\n\n159\n00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:37.817\nan enterprise situation.\n\n160\n00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:42.485\nIf you have that, you're probably going to\nnot see it if you have an E1 license or\n\n161\n00:08:42.485 --> 00:08:45.520\nan E3 license, by default,\nyou don't have that.\n\n162\n00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.184\nSo if you go in there and you go, I don't\nsee any of the stuff that Ronnie's talking\n\n163\n00:08:49.184 --> 00:08:50.904\nabout as I'm looking through my own.\n\n164\n00:08:50.904 --> 00:08:53.935\nVerify and check your license,\nyour particular subscription, and\n\n165\n00:08:53.935 --> 00:08:55.984\nverify that you have\nsomething that you need.\n\n166\n00:08:55.984 --> 00:08:58.266\nIf you don’t, it's not going be there,\nso, who has it?\n\n167\n00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:01.604\nWell, E5 license, of course,\nwhich is the most expensive one, and\n\n168\n00:09:01.604 --> 00:09:04.727\nthey have it by default, and\nall of that stuff will be available.\n\n169\n00:09:04.727 --> 00:09:08.368\nSo when you go into Security &amp; Compliance\nCenter, which we're about to show you,\n\n170\n00:09:08.368 --> 00:09:10.304\nyou might go, I don't have that link.\n\n171\n00:09:10.304 --> 00:09:13.604\nIt's not there, well,\nthat means you probably don't have it,\n\n172\n00:09:13.604 --> 00:09:14.565\nnow can you get it?\n\n173\n00:09:14.565 --> 00:09:15.593\nYes, you have two ways.\n\n174\n00:09:15.593 --> 00:09:19.008\nYou can go and ask whoever\nthe Office 365 admin is, say, hey,\n\n175\n00:09:19.008 --> 00:09:21.823\nbump my account up to the E5,\nI really want to see it.\n\n176\n00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:24.471\nAnd they'll probably go, no.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't have that kind of Cloud\n\n177\n00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:26.587\naround here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't have that.\n\n178\n00:09:26.587 --> 00:09:31.118\nBut you can have that add on,\nin other words, you can actually ask them,\n\n179\n00:09:31.118 --> 00:09:34.921\nis it possible for\nme to access advanced threat protection?\n\n180\n00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:36.609\nAnd they'll probably just say no again.\n\n181\n00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:40.044\nSo I wish I could tell you differently,\nbut it's another add on cost, essentially,\n\n182\n00:09:40.044 --> 00:09:40.628\nis what it is.\n\n183\n00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:43.204\nSo there are add on packages,\nand if you do that.\n\n184\n00:09:43.204 --> 00:09:45.388\nThen, through your E1, E3 license,\n\n185\n00:09:45.388 --> 00:09:49.259\nyou can end up seeing the advanced\nthreat protection features as well.\n\n186\n00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:53.197\nSo let's go ahead and show you how to find\nthis idea of advanced threat protection,\n\n187\n00:09:53.197 --> 00:09:55.236\nand there's a couple\nof ways you can do it.\n\n188\n00:09:55.236 --> 00:09:59.323\nLet's take a look at our screen here,\nI'm simply on a Windows 10 machine at this\n\n189\n00:09:59.323 --> 00:10:01.766\npoint, I'm going to\nlaunch up Microsoft Edge.\n\n190\n00:10:01.766 --> 00:10:05.894\nWe can always get there through,\nof course,\n\n191\n00:10:05.894 --> 00:10:11.556\njust the regular idea of going\nto our login for Office 365.\n\n192\n00:10:11.556 --> 00:10:15.232\nWhich, of course, is portal.office.com.\n\n193\n00:10:15.232 --> 00:10:17.426\nAnd from here, you can pick the account,\n\n194\n00:10:17.426 --> 00:10:21.134\nI'm going to be impersonating Joey\non this particular account here.\n\n195\n00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:30.244\nOops, I've got to remember the password.\n&gt;&gt; N'sync for\n\n196\n00:10:30.244 --> 00:10:31.701\nlife.\n&gt;&gt; Is that what it is?\n\n197\n00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:33.084\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n198\n00:10:33.084 --> 00:10:34.083\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n223\n00:11:28.695 --> 00:11:30.851\n&gt;&gt; So that's Vonne that comes in and\n\n224\n00:11:30.851 --> 00:11:31.626\ndoes that.\n\n225\n00:11:31.626 --> 00:11:34.537\nBut if you want the advanced\nthreat protection,\n\n226\n00:11:34.537 --> 00:11:36.957\nyou can go into Security &amp; Compliance.\n\n227\n00:11:36.957 --> 00:11:41.692\nAnd it's within Security &amp; Compliance that\nwe have access to all this information,\n\n228\n00:11:41.692 --> 00:11:43.941\nthat really brings us to what we need to.\n\n229\n00:11:43.941 --> 00:11:49.194\nNow I want you to notice the change\nup here in the URL, okay?\n\n230\n00:11:49.194 --> 00:11:53.968\nSo notice it says protection.office.com,\nis where that brings you, so\n\n231\n00:11:53.968 --> 00:11:56.033\nif I launch up another browser.\n\n232\n00:11:56.033 --> 00:11:58.430\nAnd you go, man, I just need to,\n\n233\n00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:03.600\nI don't need to go to portal.office,\nsign in and wait for it to log in.\n\n234\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.728\nAnd then select Security\n&amp; Compliance Center.\n\n235\n00:12:05.728 --> 00:12:12.994\nCan I simply just go to, well, if I\ncan type it in, protection.office.com?\n\n236\n00:12:12.994 --> 00:12:16.098\nAnd if I press that, and\nbecause I'm already logged in,\n\n237\n00:12:16.098 --> 00:12:19.539\nnotice it brings me to the same place,\npretty much just about.\n\n238\n00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:21.502\nAnd you'll see right there at the top,\n\n239\n00:12:21.502 --> 00:12:24.249\nit really brings you to\nSecurity &amp; Compliance again.\n\n240\n00:12:24.249 --> 00:12:26.641\nSo it's just the same thing.\n&gt;&gt; A different way of getting there.\n\n241\n00:12:26.641 --> 00:12:29.115\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a different way of getting there,\n\n242\n00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:32.235\neither one will work for\nyou, but I don't know why.\n\n243\n00:12:32.235 --> 00:12:35.057\nBut let's just say, for example,\non the exam, it could say,\n\n244\n00:12:35.057 --> 00:12:38.431\nwhich of the following links will take\nyou to advanced threat protection?\n\n245\n00:12:38.431 --> 00:12:43.101\nWell, both of them will, but if you\nsee this one, protection.office.com,\n\n246\n00:12:43.101 --> 00:12:45.343\nthat will get you there immediately.\n\n247\n00:12:45.343 --> 00:12:49.038\nInstead of you having to navigate\nthrough to get directly here.\n\n248\n00:12:49.038 --> 00:12:52.153\nAll right, so\nwithin this Security &amp; Compliance center,\n\n249\n00:12:52.153 --> 00:12:54.411\nI'm going to expand this out a little bit.\n\n250\n00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:59.491\nLet me check on my, I'm at 180%,\nso that's pretty good,\n\n251\n00:12:59.491 --> 00:13:02.229\nthat's, don't get me wrong.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n252\n00:13:02.229 --> 00:13:05.107\nI couldn't even tell a difference,\nbut that's because I'm so\n\n253\n00:13:05.107 --> 00:13:07.607\nvision impaired here, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Well, at this point,\n\n254\n00:13:07.607 --> 00:13:11.146\nI just want to make sure that we can see\nthe stuff that we need to be able to see.\n\n255\n00:13:11.146 --> 00:13:15.232\nSo you might see where I'm scrolling\naround the screen a little bit, but\n\n256\n00:13:15.232 --> 00:13:18.252\nat least you'll be able to\nsee what we have access to.\n\n257\n00:13:18.252 --> 00:13:22.165\nOver on the Navigation pane,\nI'm simply going to scroll down so\n\n258\n00:13:22.165 --> 00:13:26.160\nthat you can see some of the different\nareas that you have in here.\n\n259\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.677\nAlerts, Permissions, Classifications,\nData loss prevention, Data governance.\n\n260\n00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:38.170\nThreat management, Search &amp; investigation,\nReports, and Service assurance.\n\n261\n00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.184\nSo, Cherokee,\nhopefully this will make sense,\n\n262\n00:13:41.184 --> 00:13:42.102\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n263\n00:13:42.102 --> 00:13:43.523\n&gt;&gt; If we're looking for\n\n264\n00:13:43.523 --> 00:13:46.054\nadvanced threat protection, okay?\n\n265\n00:13:46.054 --> 00:13:50.748\nAdvanced threat protection, which of\nthose options would I choose over here on\n\n266\n00:13:50.748 --> 00:13:54.479\nthe left-hand side to get me there?\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to pick up what you're\n\n267\n00:13:54.479 --> 00:13:58.352\nputting down with the emphasis on threat\nand go with threat management for 500,\n\n268\n00:13:58.352 --> 00:14:00.456\nAlex.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you are correct,\n\n269\n00:14:00.456 --> 00:14:01.590\n500.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n270\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.349\n&gt;&gt; Threat management here is where we\n\n271\n00:14:04.349 --> 00:14:06.637\nnormally want to go, okay?\n\n272\n00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:08.456\nNow underneath Threat management,\n\n273\n00:14:08.456 --> 00:14:10.929\nof course,\nyou can see a lot of different things.\n\n274\n00:14:10.929 --> 00:14:13.187\nAnd I'm going to select the Dashboard, so\n\n275\n00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:16.720\nthat we can talk about some of\nthe different things that we can see.\n\n276\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.637\nNow, on this one, this dashboard,\nlet me do something else,\n\n277\n00:14:19.637 --> 00:14:21.021\nI'm going to collapse this.\n\n278\n00:14:21.021 --> 00:14:24.023\nAnd we'll go back to\nthe Navigation tool in a moment.\n\n279\n00:14:24.023 --> 00:14:29.062\nBut notice that it gives me just a summary\nof what it's actually doing, right?\n\n280\n00:14:29.062 --> 00:14:36.361\nWeekly threat detections, 24 messages\nhave been scanned, 0 delivered to junk.\n\n281\n00:14:36.361 --> 00:14:39.516\nThreats stopped,\nremoved immediately after delivery.\n\n282\n00:14:39.516 --> 00:14:40.108\n&gt;&gt; It looks pretty healthy.\n\n283\n00:14:40.108 --> 00:14:41.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty healthy at this\n\n284\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.209\npoint, and that's because we\ndon't actually use this for\n\n285\n00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:44.433\nanything else but demonstrations.\n\n286\n00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:45.247\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is good.\n\n287\n00:14:45.247 --> 00:14:45.759\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n288\n00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:47.753\n&gt;&gt; Malware family detected.\n\n289\n00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:50.725\nSecurity trends,\nMalware trends, you name it,\n\n290\n00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:52.819\nit doesn't detect any.\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n291\n00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:53.907\n&gt;&gt; Alert policies.\n\n292\n00:14:53.907 --> 00:14:55.087\n&gt;&gt; How they're giving\n\n293\n00:14:55.087 --> 00:14:57.244\nsome brief information on popular,\n\n294\n00:14:57.244 --> 00:14:59.446\nor not popular, but, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n295\n00:14:59.446 --> 00:15:00.382\n&gt;&gt; Trending type of malware.\n\n296\n00:15:00.382 --> 00:15:01.228\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah,\n\n297\n00:15:01.228 --> 00:15:03.352\nit really does help you to see a lot.\n\n298\n00:15:03.352 --> 00:15:07.868\nAnd you also see that you're part of\nsomething that's a little bit bigger than\n\n299\n00:15:07.868 --> 00:15:10.409\njust your own Office 365 subscription.\n\n300\n00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:14.347\nAnd that's this idea of\nGlobal Weekly Theat Detections, and\n\n301\n00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:18.296\neven this Origin of Messages,\nstuff that you see right here.\n\n302\n00:15:18.296 --> 00:15:19.424\nAnd, you're going, man,\n\n303\n00:15:19.424 --> 00:15:22.397\nmine actually looks a little bit better\nthan what yours looks, on screen.\n\n304\n00:15:22.397 --> 00:15:23.986\nBut, it's because I'm scaled in really\nbig, that's what you're seeing.\n\n305\n00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:25.000\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n306\n00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.167\nIt's kind of cool,\n\n307\n00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:30.847\nbecause you're really leveraging\nMicrosoft's international network here.\n\n308\n00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.406\nAnd all of the information and\n\n309\n00:15:32.406 --> 00:15:36.590\nknowledge that they bring to the table to\nshare with you for your protection, so\n\n310\n00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.888\nit is a cool concept.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the very fact is,\n\n311\n00:15:38.888 --> 00:15:42.014\nwe are tied into their security\nintelligence at some point right?\n\n312\n00:15:42.014 --> 00:15:45.342\nWe are getting this and we are able to\nuse some of that information for us.\n\n313\n00:15:45.342 --> 00:15:47.743\nWe have Messages,\nwe have Threats stopped, and\n\n314\n00:15:47.743 --> 00:15:50.919\nyou will see that this will be\nGlobal weekly threat detections.\n\n315\n00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:56.404\nMessages scanned in Office 365,\nglobally at this point,\n\n316\n00:15:56.404 --> 00:16:00.834\n38.92 billion Have actually been scanned,\n\n317\n00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:04.324\n6.818 million threats stopped.\n\n318\n00:16:04.324 --> 00:16:09.780\nBlocked by Advanced Threat Protection,\n4.101 million, okay?\n\n319\n00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:16.780\nAnd then removed after delivery, about\n973,000, 974,000, let's round up here.\n\n320\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.330\nSo it at least gives you something that\nyou can take a look at in that dashboard\n\n321\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.640\nfor just some global information.\n\n322\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.060\nAs I spanned out that navigation\npane a little bit more, and\n\n323\n00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.720\nI click on that dropdown,\n\n324\n00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.990\nnow of course, if we want to set\nsomething else up here, okay?\n\n325\n00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:39.555\nThe key is that if you can't see some of\nthis stuff here, that's when you know that\n\n326\n00:16:39.555 --> 00:16:43.412\nyou don't have the right security or\nthe right billing policy here.\n\n327\n00:16:43.412 --> 00:16:45.256\nSo if I click on Policy,\n\n328\n00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:51.280\nthis really does begin the idea of where\nyou see Advanced Threat Protection.\n\n329\n00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.946\nNotice the term ATP, ATP.\n\n330\n00:16:52.946 --> 00:16:55.310\nIt also includes anti-malware and\n\n331\n00:16:55.310 --> 00:17:00.770\nanti-spam as well as this DKIM here to\nwhich is DomainKeys Identified Mail.\n\n332\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.640\nInformation for\n\n333\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.440\nthings like some DNS settings that\nyou also have to be aware of as well.\n\n334\n00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.780\nSo these are the general policies\nthat really do make up the idea of\n\n335\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:15.040\nAdvanced Threat Protection itself\nis what we end up seeing here.\n\n336\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.000\nSo as long as we have access to this,\n\n337\n00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.415\nwhere we're seeing ATP and\nthe safe attachments, safe links,\n\n338\n00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:26.940\nanti-spam DKIM, then you'd probably\nhave the subscription that you need.\n\n339\n00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.550\nBut if you kind of go there and\nthe policy only shows you,\n\n340\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.140\nlet's say, anti-malware and anti-spam or\n\n341\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.550\nsomething like that and DKIM,\nthen you probably don't have it, okay?\n\n342\n00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.970\nSo, at that point,\nthat means you'll have to go and get-\n\n343\n00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.259\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Upgrade your subscription.\n\n344\n00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:41.806\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's right here.\n\n345\n00:17:41.806 --> 00:17:48.120\nWe just wanted to do a short demonstration\non what it is that we're likely to set up.\n\n346\n00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.996\nNow, we're really only gonna look at one\nof them because it's probably the more\n\n347\n00:17:51.996 --> 00:17:55.929\npopular one that's out here, which is\nthe idea of Advanced Threat Protection and\n\n348\n00:17:55.929 --> 00:17:56.570\nsafe links.\n\n349\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.170\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of actually\nsetting up safe attachments is great.\n\n350\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.522\nNotice it says protects your\norganization from malicious content in\n\n351\n00:18:04.522 --> 00:18:06.330\nemail attachments, okay?\n\n352\n00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:11.960\nAnd in files in SharePoint,\nOneDrive, and Teams.\n\n353\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.579\nSo it is fairly comprehensive for\nall of those programs there.\n\n354\n00:18:16.579 --> 00:18:19.670\nAnd that's what makes it part of\nthat Advanced Threat Protection.\n\n355\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.410\nBut the safe links is the same way.\n\n356\n00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.570\nProtects users from opening and\nsharing malicious email\n\n357\n00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:30.770\nfrom malicious links in email messages and\nOffice 2016 Desktop Apps.\n\n358\n00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.973\nNow, it actually does include,\nI think, as of October 2017,\n\n359\n00:18:34.973 --> 00:18:36.980\nwhich was just a few months ago.\n\n360\n00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.330\nIt also included things like iOS apps.\n\n361\n00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:44.456\nSo if you're running Word in the iPhone,\nI can't remember\n\n362\n00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:48.440\nwhat the thing was called, iPhone.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm on an Android, from the app store,\n\n364\n00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.570\nit's the app from the app store there for\nWord.\n\n365\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:59.070\nWell, it even can do that, so it can\neven protect those mobile devices too.\n\n366\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.427\nSo for us to set this up, okay,\nnotice it gives you this link here.\n\n367\n00:19:03.427 --> 00:19:08.205\nAs I hover over it, I get that\nlittle finger for my cursor instead.\n\n368\n00:19:08.205 --> 00:19:09.171\nSo there's the arrow, and\n\n369\n00:19:09.171 --> 00:19:11.447\nI hover over it, it looks like you\nshould be able to click there.\n\n370\n00:19:11.447 --> 00:19:13.830\nBut there's nothing to click\non when you click on that.\n\n371\n00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.003\nAt least I tried and, yeah,\nsee, it doesn't go anywhere.\n\n372\n00:19:16.003 --> 00:19:17.694\nIt just kinda highlights it.\n&gt;&gt; So, this is, what?\n\n373\n00:19:17.694 --> 00:19:22.549\nJust happening automatically\nby having a blacklist or\n\n374\n00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:28.315\nblocked URLs in their database?\n&gt;&gt; No, I think they just messed up here.\n\n375\n00:19:28.315 --> 00:19:29.630\nThey wanted you to be\nable to change the name.\n\n376\n00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.454\nBut it you wanna click,\nand get access to it,\n\n377\n00:19:31.454 --> 00:19:32.994\nyou have to come down here to the icon.\n\n378\n00:19:32.994 --> 00:19:34.607\nAnd then if I click there,\nnotice it changes.\n\n379\n00:19:34.607 --> 00:19:35.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you can configure it.\n\n380\n00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can configure it.\n\n381\n00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.380\nIt's just a little bit strange here.\n\n382\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.020\nI don't know why, it's just the way it is,\nat least right now.\n\n383\n00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:48.006\nOf course, Microsoft is gonna take a look\nat my show and go, Ronnie is right.\n\n384\n00:19:48.006 --> 00:19:49.210\nNo, I don't think they're gonna do that.\n\n385\n00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.617\nThey're just gonna say Ronnie,\nget over it, okay?\n\n386\n00:19:51.617 --> 00:19:54.015\nThat's not really something\nyou should focus in on.\n\n387\n00:19:54.015 --> 00:19:55.998\nBut sometimes you just do.\n\n388\n00:19:55.998 --> 00:20:00.135\nNow when they start updating things inside\nof Office 365, if you haven't been in it\n\n389\n00:20:00.135 --> 00:20:04.103\nlong enough where you're starting to see\nthis, whenever you see this yellow bar up\n\n390\n00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:07.898\nhere inside of any one of those links that\nyou click on, it more than likely means\n\n391\n00:20:07.898 --> 00:20:11.329\nthat they've changes something,\nthat they've updated something.\n\n392\n00:20:11.329 --> 00:20:12.640\nAnd they just want you to know about it.\n\n393\n00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.030\nSo notice for this one.\n\n394\n00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.240\nReports for this feature just got better.\n\n395\n00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.470\nCheck out the new report in Security and\n\n396\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.150\nCompliance Center for\nenhanced reporting experience.\n\n397\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.430\nBut we'll go and check that out in\njust a moment after we finish up here.\n\n398\n00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.600\nBut let's take a look at this so far.\n\n399\n00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.940\nSo safe links,\nremember what this is about.\n\n400\n00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.410\nPeople end up sending you links and\nemails, and for end users,\n\n401\n00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.540\nthis is where the problem comes in, right?\n\n402\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.280\nEnd users really kinda start to say,\noo, look at that.\n\n403\n00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.100\nI got an email here and there's a link.\n\n404\n00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.823\nI don't know who sent me that email but\nthat link right at the beginning of\n\n405\n00:20:44.823 --> 00:20:47.570\nthe caption says, hey-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It's from last night's\n\n406\n00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.378\nparty, or something like that-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah, or\n\n407\n00:20:49.378 --> 00:20:50.770\nwhatever it might be.\n&gt;&gt; What was that?\n\n408\n00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.491\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and click on that.\n\n409\n00:20:52.491 --> 00:20:56.590\nAnd then they click on it and\nthey don't think about it again, okay?\n\n410\n00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.449\nDoesn't matter that Cherokee put\nout a policy that said, hey,\n\n411\n00:21:00.449 --> 00:21:05.463\nif you don't who this email's from and if\nyou see a link there, don't click on it.\n\n412\n00:21:05.463 --> 00:21:09.630\nThey open it up and they click on it,\nand that's where the problem comes in.\n\n413\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:14.290\nSo now, the great thing is in something\nlike safe link, we have the ability to\n\n414\n00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:19.330\nchange that and to make sure that we\ncan actually get what we need to.\n\n415\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.610\nSo that's something else\nthat you can actually do.\n\n416\n00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:26.140\nNow, let's say that you get to this point,\nokay?\n\n417\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.740\nAnd as you're ready to do this,\n\n418\n00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:33.250\nyou kind of find out something here, which\nis what I want to point out as well, okay?\n\n419\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.320\nWhich is that,\nwe really need to take a look at this and\n\n420\n00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.410\njust spend a little bit of time\nmaking sure that we can get access.\n\n421\n00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.590\nAnd understanding how to set\nsomething like safe links up.\n\n422\n00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.770\nThe great thing is when you get into\nthe attachments and the other things,\n\n423\n00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:51.520\nit's relatively familiar to the concept\nthat we're gonna take a look at here.\n\n424\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.920\nBut you will see that\nthis is a part of this.\n\n425\n00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.183\nSo the first thing that we want to do, and\n\n426\n00:21:57.183 --> 00:22:00.990\nwe may have to kinda split this\nlab setting up a little bit here.\n\n427\n00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.897\nWe've got a few minutes left.\n\n428\n00:22:01.897 --> 00:22:03.238\nI wanna get started in lab.\n\n429\n00:22:03.238 --> 00:22:06.840\nBut it may be where we come back and\nfinish this lab up in another part.\n\n430\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.340\nSo at this point, notice, Cherokee,\nthere's actually a setting here.\n\n431\n00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.590\nAnd if I scroll down,\nand the neat thing is,\n\n432\n00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.990\nwith my scale in feature,\nit really does kinda mislead us.\n\n433\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.310\nWhich is cool because I wanted to\n\n434\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.050\ndo that on purpose.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n435\n00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:21.850\n&gt;&gt; So right now,\n\n436\n00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:27.260\nif you take a look where it says Policies\nthat apply to the entire organization.\n\n437\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.250\nLet me zoom in just,\nI didn't realize I forgot\n\n438\n00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.700\nI gotta click on this little zoom feature\nfor me inside of my virtual machine.\n\n439\n00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.715\nHopefully, it didn't make it so\nbad that we can't see it anymore,\n\n440\n00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:42.755\nbut bring us back up here.\n\n441\n00:22:42.755 --> 00:22:44.495\nSo notice where it says that, right?\n\n442\n00:22:44.495 --> 00:22:47.057\nPolicies that apply to\nthe entire organization.\n\n443\n00:22:47.057 --> 00:22:48.398\nThat's the default, right?\n\n444\n00:22:48.398 --> 00:22:50.585\nSo they're saying, hey,\nif you set this policy up,\n\n445\n00:22:50.585 --> 00:22:53.845\nit applies to everybody in\nyour Office 365 subscription.\n\n446\n00:22:53.845 --> 00:22:56.825\nGreat, okay, so\nI wanna create a policy that applies,\n\n447\n00:22:56.825 --> 00:22:57.767\nwhat?\n&gt;&gt;

Edit, modify.\n\n453\n00:23:11.504 --> 00:23:12.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n454\n00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.540\nif I wanted to create a policy that\napplied to the entire organizatoin,\n\n455\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.610\nwhat am I missing, Cherokee?\n&gt;&gt; A plus button.\n\n456\n00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:19.487\n&gt;&gt; More than likely a plus button,\n\n457\n00:23:19.487 --> 00:23:20.113\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Adding-\n\n458\n00:23:20.113 --> 00:23:20.768\n&gt;&gt;

Well,\n\n463\n00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.870\nI'm not too familiar with Office 365.\n\n464\n00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:35.150\nSo I'm gonna relate it to the closest\nthing that I can relate in my mind,\n\n465\n00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:41.237\nwould be something like group policy,\nwhere I'm modifying the default policy.\n\n466\n00:23:41.237 --> 00:23:45.699\nAnd that's not necessarily,\nsome organizations\n\n467\n00:23:45.699 --> 00:23:50.820\nfrowned upon using that and\nhaving a gigantic policy.\n\n468\n00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.902\nA little more control if you\nhave a lot of smaller policies.\n\n469\n00:23:53.902 --> 00:23:55.423\nSo, I don't know, Ronnie.\n\n470\n00:23:55.423 --> 00:23:56.580\nWhat do we do?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n471\n00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.435\nthat's the key is that on something\nlike this, if it applies to everybody,\n\n472\n00:24:00.435 --> 00:24:02.683\nthey want you to modify\nthe default policy.\n\n473\n00:24:02.683 --> 00:24:04.162\nYou don't get to create a new one,\n\n474\n00:24:04.162 --> 00:24:07.880\nyou just get to modify the default one\nthat is what they're letting you do.\n\n475\n00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.050\nNow, if we take a look over\nhere on the right hand side,\n\n476\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.740\nnotice it gives me a summary and\nI'll see if I can scroll this up so\n\n477\n00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.120\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n478\n00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.590\nMaybe, there we go, I went too far.\n\n479\n00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.410\nOkay, so do not track when users click\nsafe link is enabled at this point.\n\n480\n00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:32.030\nWeird, do not let users click through\nsafe links to the original URL as well,\n\n481\n00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.560\nand that is enabled.\n\n482\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.010\nWell let's talk about what\nthat means right here\n\n483\n00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:40.650\nin our last couple of moments together for\nthis episode.\n\n484\n00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:45.440\nIf I can scroll back over to the top\nhere and then over to the right.\n\n485\n00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.080\nSo, if I select default and then I click\non the pencil, we need to figure out what\n\n486\n00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.670\nthose two settings actually do\nmean here for just a moment.\n\n487\n00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:56.510\nAnd then we'll kinda take a break\nright here in the middle and\n\n488\n00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.400\nwe'll talk about the other thing\nthat we need to talk about as well.\n\n489\n00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.150\nSettings that apply to\ncontent across Office 365.\n\n490\n00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.250\nWhen users click a blocked URL,\n\n491\n00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.320\nthey'll be redirected to a webpage\nthat explains why it's blocked.\n\n492\n00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.410\nYou can't get much clearer than that if\nyou needed to set something like this up,\n\n493\n00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.800\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Is it gonna say,\n\n494\n00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.870\nRonnie said you're not allowed here?\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not going to.\n\n495\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.640\nIt's just gonna tell you,\n\n496\n00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.700\nhey this has been blocked by\nan administrator of course, okay?\n\n497\n00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.950\nSo you do have something like that and\n\n498\n00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.290\nof course,\nyou have this notification bubble here.\n\n499\n00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:32.470\nThese URLs are blocked and\nthe email messages in Office 365 Pro Plus.\n\n500\n00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.950\nAnd notice it says for\nthe Office ISO and Android.\n\n501\n00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:40.400\nFollows as well, and you can even\nuse things like wild cards, too.\n\n502\n00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.920\nNow if I come back over here to\nthe place where there she says,\n\n503\n00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.500\nhey you can click and add an URL.\n\n504\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.228\nJust as an example,\nI'm gonna add in like this.\n\n505\n00:25:49.228 --> 00:25:56.650\nOur forums, forums.itpro.tv.\n\n506\n00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:02.510\nAnd I can click that plus sign and\nadd that directly in there, okay?\n\n507\n00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:07.930\nNow once I do that I'll click save and\nlet it save that.\n\n508\n00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:13.180\nNow that becomes a default policy for\nus, now you do have to be patient here.\n\n509\n00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.290\nIt can take up to about 30 minutes for\nthe new policies\n\n510\n00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.990\nto spread throughout the entire Office\n365 Cloud before this takes place.\n\n511\n00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.030\nDon't just think it's gonna go,\nall right, it's done.\n\n512\n00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:24.910\nAnd we're done.\n\n513\n00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.520\nIt's gonna take about 30 minutes\nbefore something like that\n\n514\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.270\ncan end up applying and\nspread throughout there.\n\n515\n00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.030\nBut once we have this in place,\n\n516\n00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:38.550\nthen you also have to actually think\nabout what is gonna happen as well.\n\n517\n00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:42.516\nSo now if I go back and\nedit this policy after I saved it,\n\n518\n00:26:45.848 --> 00:26:50.340\nNow you can see that it gives\nme these options down here.\n\n519\n00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.180\nSettings that applied to\ncontent except email,\n\n520\n00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.840\nthese settings don't\napply to email messages.\n\n521\n00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.630\nIf you want them to\napply to email messages,\n\n522\n00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.770\nyou have to pay the safe link policy for\nemail messages as well.\n\n523\n00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:04.010\nSo I can use this safe link on\nOffice 365 ProPlus, and for\n\n524\n00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.860\nthe Office iOS and in Android app.\n\n525\n00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.140\nIf you really don't care\nabout trying to protect your\n\n526\n00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.770\nlinks inside of the Office product,\nall you have to do is simply uncheck that.\n\n527\n00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:18.340\nSo if you only want it for email, well,\nthen you don't have to worry about that.\n\n528\n00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.770\nBut why would you set it up here?\n\n529\n00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.840\nThey're saying if you only want it for\nemail go to exchange administration center\n\n530\n00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.480\nand set it up there.\n&gt;&gt; Configure it there.\n\n531\n00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Yep, for locations selected above\n\n532\n00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.030\ndo not track when users click safe links.\n\n533\n00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.140\nSo in other words,\n\n534\n00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.930\nwhen they actually track something that's\nnot being blocked, don't track it.\n\n535\n00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.370\nSo don't just track everything.\n\n536\n00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:46.170\nIf they're not clicking on this\ndon't worry about tracking it, okay?\n\n537\n00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.080\nBut this other option, which is\nsomething that you want to make sure,\n\n538\n00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.570\nwhich is also on by default\nwhen we set this up.\n\n539\n00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.070\nDo not let users click through\nsafe links to the original.\n\n540\n00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.540\nSo usually when you get this idea, right?\n\n541\n00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.710\nWhere it says it's gonna\npop up this message.\n\n542\n00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.880\nIt only gives you options,\nwhich says hey do you want to continue on?\n\n543\n00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.320\nOr do you not want to?\n\n544\n00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.310\nWell, this is saying, when you put\nthe check mark there, don't allow that.\n\n545\n00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:12.840\nDon't give them that option to click\non through to the original link that's\n\n546\n00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.910\nunsafe.\n\n547\n00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.530\nJust turn them away, block them off\nfrom actually doing something like this.\n\n548\n00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.130\nSo this is a default policy that we setup\n\n549\n00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.890\nthat we need to make\nsure that we understand.\n\n550\n00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.060\nNow, I am running out of time but\nthere is one more thing and Cherokee,\n\n551\n00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.980\nI just about forgot to mention this\nwhich is something I don't want to do.\n\n552\n00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.320\nFor you to be able to set this policy up.\n\n553\n00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.350\nLet's say that you get the idea\nof the E5 license, okay.\n\n554\n00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.300\nAnd now you go, all right I'm ready\nto set up a safe link policy.\n\n555\n00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.080\nAnd you come here and\nyou realize something.\n\n556\n00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.305\nYou don't get the pencil either, you\ndon't get to change anything like that.\n\n557\n00:28:47.305 --> 00:28:51.022\nBut more than likely means you don't\nhave the proper permissions to change\n\n558\n00:28:51.022 --> 00:28:51.758\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n559\n00:28:51.758 --> 00:28:53.762\n&gt;&gt; So it's in here that'd you have to go\n\n560\n00:28:53.762 --> 00:28:56.170\nand find those proper\npermissions to do so.\n\n561\n00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.230\nNow, for this to happen,\nyou might think it's easy enough.\n\n562\n00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.600\nI remember saying, permissions right here.\n\n563\n00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.346\nSo let me go ahead and\nclick on Permissions.\n\n564\n00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.550\nAnd then, it's in here,\nthat you're looking for one of two things.\n\n565\n00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:14.500\nOrganization management is a possibility,\nbut\n\n566\n00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.720\nthat's only gonna create the group here.\n\n567\n00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.850\nAnd then if I scroll down,\nlet me see if I can do it.\n\n568\n00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.460\nI'm actually missing\none other one here too.\n\n569\n00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.610\nAnd that's called the hygiene management.\n\n570\n00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.470\nI know that's a weird term-\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n571\n00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:30.370\nThat we have it makes you think that\nsomebody's actually watching for hygiene?\n\n572\n00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.650\nDo you have bad breath?\n&gt;&gt; Do we have\n\n573\n00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.590\na smell o meter that we have to use?\n&gt;&gt; A smell o meter\n\n574\n00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.540\nis what she actually said.\n\n575\n00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.870\nAll right, cool.\n\n576\n00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:41.580\nSo it's right here instead that\nwhere you actually need to find that\n\n577\n00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.020\nis gonna be going outside of\nthe security and compliance center.\n\n578\n00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:50.760\nAnd that means I have to click back on\nhere and go down to the Admin centers and\n\n579\n00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.370\nI need to connect to Exchange Online,\nokay?\n\n580\n00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:58.923\nSo once I get to that point,\nhopefully it will scroll for us.\n\n581\n00:30:02.104 --> 00:30:07.047\nAnd then I need to expand that out, so\nI can go back to the Admin center is down\n\n582\n00:30:07.047 --> 00:30:10.709\nhere at the bottom.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n583\n00:30:10.709 --> 00:30:14.045\nyou're still logged in as Joey?\n&gt;&gt; I'm still logged in as Joey and\n\n584\n00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:15.062\nI go to Exchange.\n\n585\n00:30:18.638 --> 00:30:22.980\nAll right so just in the moment here, once\nwe're inside the exchange admin center,\n\n586\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.480\nwhat I'm looking for is where it\nsays permissions and admin roles.\n\n587\n00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:32.540\nAnd inside of the Exchange Admin Center,\nyou'll see right here\n\n588\n00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:37.030\nis Hygiene Management and right here\nis Organizational Management, okay?\n\n589\n00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.000\nSo if you're not either one of those two,\nyou won't be able to set these links up,\n\n590\n00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.470\nor the policy that we just set,\nup to change and modify.\n\n591\n00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.250\nSo if I wanted to I could come in here and\n\n592\n00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.840\nI just double clicked on\nthe Hygiene Management.\n\n593\n00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.336\nAnd you'll see where it actually\ngives you the role and transport, and\n\n594\n00:30:52.336 --> 00:30:54.382\nit's down here where you add in a member.\n\n595\n00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:02.300\nSo now, it scrolls through, and\nI want to add in, let's say, JT.\n\n596\n00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.880\nYeah, in just a moment.\n\n597\n00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.360\nMaybe not.\nMaybe it's Justin now.\n\n598\n00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.510\nDid it change?\n\n599\n00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.230\nLet's do a search.\n\n600\n00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.140\nThere it is, Justin Timberlake.\n\n601\n00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.105\nYou can tell that I was the one that\nactually really did set up this-\n\n602\n00:31:16.105 --> 00:31:16.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n603\n00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.620\n&gt;&gt; Organization according\n\n604\n00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.970\nto my specs because I love whatever group\nthey were in which I can't even name.\n\n605\n00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.730\nSo, there you go.\n\n606\n00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.030\nFrom that point, you click save and\nthat makes them a part of it.\n\n607\n00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:30.050\nSo that way if you were a part of\nthat group, now you can go in and\n\n608\n00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:31.920\nconfigure those links too.\n\n609\n00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.200\nSo that really brings us to the end of\nthe first part of our demonstration here.\n\n610\n00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.120\nBut that doesn't mean that we're\ncompletely done yet ,Cherokee.\n\n611\n00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.570\nIt means that we have to think about\nsomething else, which is this, okay?\n\n612\n00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.100\nWhat if I do want that?\n\n613\n00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.430\nWhat if that's exactly what I want to do?\n\n614\n00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:49.758\nAnd then the marketing\nteam comes to me and\n\n615\n00:31:49.758 --> 00:31:53.763\ngoes, Ronnie,\nI can't get to ITProTV anymore.\n\n616\n00:31:53.763 --> 00:31:58.582\nAnd I go, yeah, that's because our\nforum's not ITProTV anymore, but\n\n617\n00:31:58.582 --> 00:32:01.449\nI still need to get there, okay?\n&gt;&gt; It's part of my job function.\n\n618\n00:32:01.449 --> 00:32:02.679\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, part of my job function.\n\n619\n00:32:02.679 --> 00:32:06.553\nIt's part of something that I need to do,\nbut you've just created a default policy-\n\n620\n00:32:06.553 --> 00:32:07.268\n&gt;&gt; It blocks me.\n\n621\n00:32:07.268 --> 00:32:08.554\n&gt;&gt; That blocks everything.\n\n622\n00:32:08.554 --> 00:32:11.364\nSo how do we handle those?\n&gt;&gt; Hm, so you've given us a cliffhanger,\n\n623\n00:32:11.364 --> 00:32:12.279\nRonnie.\n&gt;&gt; I am, so\n\n624\n00:32:12.279 --> 00:32:16.681\nshe ended up taking a look at how\nwe managed that a little bit more.\n\n625\n00:32:16.681 --> 00:32:18.639\nAnd it's not the most\nexciting thing in the world.\n\n626\n00:32:18.639 --> 00:32:20.686\nBut it is something that\nyou need to take a look at.\n\n627\n00:32:20.686 --> 00:32:23.045\nAnd we'll go ahead and\ntake a look at setting that up, and\n\n628\n00:32:23.045 --> 00:32:25.075\nthen taking a look at some\nof those other things.\n\n629\n00:32:25.075 --> 00:32:29.941\nAnd at least explore the settings for\nsomething like, the safe attachments,\n\n630\n00:32:29.941 --> 00:32:33.060\nand some of those other\nparts of ATP as well.\n\n631\n00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.980\nBut overall, Cherokee,\nthis is a great place for\n\n632\n00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.580\nus to at least stop this episode.\n\n633\n00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.760\nAnd then we'll pick up on\nthat on the next episode.\n\n634\n00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.559\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, Ronnie,\n\n635\n00:32:39.559 --> 00:32:41.776\nthank you for your time today,\nand thank you, as well.\n\n636\n00:32:41.776 --> 00:32:44.887\nBut stay tuned, you don't wanna\nmiss the upcoming demonstration.\n\n637\n00:32:44.887 --> 00:32:46.385\nFor this show, we'll sign out.\n\n638\n00:32:46.385 --> 00:32:48.916\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n639\n00:32:48.916 --> 00:32:51.958\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n640\n00:32:51.958 --> 00:32:58.018\n[MUSIC]\n\n641\n00:32:58.018 --> 00:33:01.130\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.960\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.250\nWelcome back ladies and\ngentlemen to your 70-347 Series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.460\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.620\nIn this episode we will continue taking\na look at Advanced Threat Protection.\n\n7\n00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.800\nAnd just as promised Ronnie\nis back in the studios today\n\n8\n00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.019\nto bring you that [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n\n9\n00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.850\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee thank you again for\n\n10\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.140\nhaving me back on the show\nas we will continue.\n\n11\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.434\nWe are in the middle of\ndoing this demonstration,\n\n12\n00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.080\nespecially on safelinks, right?\n\n13\n00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.380\nRemember the idea behind safe links?\n\n14\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.900\nI don't know why you would, but if you\nhappened to just pick up on part two,\n\n15\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.510\nmake sure you go back and watch the part\none, as we started configuring safe links.\n\n16\n00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.580\nAnd the only thing we did at that point\nwas configure what we called, of course,\n\n17\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.100\nthe default policy that is there for\nthe safe links.\n\n18\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.200\nAnd we added in a single URL.\n\n19\n00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.320\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nmy screen as I've navigated back to\n\n20\n00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.730\nthe compliance and security,\nor security and compliance.\n\n21\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.740\nI know it's right in front of me,\nand I'm still gonna say it wrong.\n\n22\n00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.070\nSecurity and compliance center, and\nthen from there into policies, and\n\n23\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.580\nthen we selected safe links\ninside those policies.\n\n24\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.090\nAnd here's the default policy,\nif I click on of course the pencil,\n\n25\n00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.580\nthat allows me to edit.\n\n26\n00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.860\nYou'll see I edited in that one URL.\n\n27\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.680\nNow you do want to be careful in\nadding something like that in.\n\n28\n00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.690\nAnd this is where, let me see if I\ncan scroll this up here a little bit.\n\n29\n00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.280\nI want you, I know this is\ngonna sound kinda like, Ronnie,\n\n30\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.090\nyou're just not putting the work in,\nyou just want us to read.\n\n31\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.410\nWell I want you to read this anyways,\nokay?\n\n32\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.550\nSo select this where it says Get\nhelp with this, and it says hey,\n\n33\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.350\nyou can use three wild card\nasterisks per URL entered.\n\n34\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.750\nWhy would that actually need a note for\nsomething like that?\n\n35\n00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.410\nWhat is that about?\n\n36\n00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.090\nYeah, it's a weird kind of a statement.\n\n37\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.810\nWhere is says you can use three wild\ncard asterisks per URL entered.\n\n38\n00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.615\n&gt;&gt; So I'm assuming for\nsubdomains and maybe some sites or\n\n39\n00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:08.300\nURLs that have multiple child domains.\n\n40\n00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah there's a couple of\ndifferent things and let's go ahead and\n\n41\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.690\nshow you where it brings you.\n\n42\n00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.210\nAnd that's what I wanna get\nto is this idea of a sample\n\n43\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.910\nentry that you can put in.\n\n44\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.740\nSo you don't always have to do the HTTP or\nthe HTTPS colon, but\n\n45\n00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.340\nyou can if you want to.\n\n46\n00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.940\nBut if you wanted to be able to\n\n47\n00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.570\nadd in something like a wildcard\nto help you to do something.\n\n48\n00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.477\nSo the sample entry that we used\nwas forums.itprotv.com, I think.\n\n49\n00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:41.697\n&gt;&gt; .TV.\n&gt;&gt; .TV, yeah, forums.itpro.tv.\n\n50\n00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:42.834\nI'm not gonna remember that.\n\n51\n00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:44.080\nOkay, so there it is.\n\n52\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.540\nAnd now notice that you could actually\ndo something like this as well.\n\n53\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.830\nIf you want to make sure\neverything related to ITPro.tv, so\n\n54\n00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.600\nif I did this second line\nhere where it said or.\n\n55\n00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.170\nAnd notice it says *contoso.com* well\nthat means anything that proceeds, so\n\n56\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.560\nthis would have covered not only IT PROTV,\nbut the forums .itprotv as well.\n\n57\n00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.640\nAnd let's say, for example, and I don't\nknow if we do or not, let's say for\n\n58\n00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.133\nexample we had a marketing.itprotv.com or\n\n59\n00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:17.870\na sales.itprotv.com-\n&gt;&gt; Or even added them in the future.\n\n60\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.450\n&gt;&gt; Or yeah, added them into the future,\nit would cover that as well.\n\n61\n00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.440\nAnd we're just saying comprehensively\nthis covers everything.\n\n62\n00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.438\nSo either one does that so\nI did here I actually just limited\n\n63\n00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:34.700\nus to forums.itprotv it says block\ndomains, sub domains and paths.\n\n64\n00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.990\nSo notice how much it does\nblock if you just enter in that\n\n65\n00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.460\nidea of what we call that, I know it's\nkind of weird just called the bare domain,\n\n66\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.170\nis what you see there.\n\n67\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.550\nNow the other one, though, notice it\nsays it can block a single site, but\n\n68\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.170\nnot actually additional subpaths, too.\n\n69\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.590\nSo if you just wanted to\nblock one particular one but\n\n70\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.860\nno additional subpaths, well, you could\neven do something like this as well.\n\n71\n00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.520\nWhere it's actually saying\nwe'll block this one, but\n\n72\n00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.710\nnot a subpath that also\nsneaks off of that one.\n\n73\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.020\nAnd then you can of course do this\none which says block the site and\n\n74\n00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.080\nall the additional sub-paths.\n\n75\n00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.690\nNotice where this comes in as far as\nthe asterisk goes, which is A and\n\n76\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.310\nthen any of the sub-paths underneath that.\n\n77\n00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.949\nSo the first one here without the A,\nit only blocks out, but not the additional\n\n78\n00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.489\nsub-paths that may be there-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n79\n00:04:27.489 --> 00:04:31.507\n&gt;&gt; Whereas this one says block this\nparticular original path here, but\n\n80\n00:04:31.507 --> 00:04:34.420\nalso block every sub path after that.,\nokay?\n\n81\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.615\n&gt;&gt; Definitely want to test this after\nyou type it in and [CROSSTALK],\n\n82\n00:04:37.615 --> 00:04:39.457\njust to make sure you typed it right.\n\n83\n00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:42.360\nBecause it could be a little confusing if\nyou're just going through that quickly.\n\n84\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really can.\n\n85\n00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.570\nSo there are special rules here when\nyou deal with things like asterisks.\n\n86\n00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.660\nAnd I guarantee you something.\n\n87\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.930\nI can't tell you that that's\nnot gonna appear on the exam.\n\n88\n00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.257\nSomething just like which of the following\nwould actually apply to this particular\n\n89\n00:04:56.257 --> 00:05:00.596\nsub-domain, well you've got to know that\nthis is how you do something like that.\n\n90\n00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:01.990\n&gt;&gt; Or even those scenario type situations.\n\n91\n00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.990\nIt's like hey, I want to go ahead and\n\n92\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.920\nblock user one from being\nable to access this URL.\n\n93\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.900\nWhat command is going to get me there or\nwhat path is going to get me there?\n\n94\n00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so just make sure you\npay attention to that link.\n\n95\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.870\nAnd if you click on it that\nis exactly what it would do.\n\n96\n00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.080\nIt would help you discover\nthat a little bit more.\n\n97\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.240\nSo let's say we were to change this\ndefault here for just a moment.\n\n98\n00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.640\nAnd let me see if I can add this back in.\n\n99\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.550\nSo, I have forums.itprotv\nwhich is everything, right?\n\n100\n00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.689\nWell, I don't have to do that.\n\n101\n00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:40.306\nI can simply select that and actually\nremove that if I want to, and that out.\n\n102\n00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:45.283\nAnd now let's say that what I wanna do\ninside of our forms we have subforms\n\n103\n00:05:45.283 --> 00:05:49.935\nessentially like Cisco, and\nthen we have General We have CompTIA,\n\n104\n00:05:49.935 --> 00:05:53.546\nwe have Microsoft,\nwe have whatever else, Apple.\n\n105\n00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:57.420\nA whole bunch of things in which\nwe have different forum paths to.\n\n106\n00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.024\nLet's say that I wanna do is not so\n\n107\n00:06:00.024 --> 00:06:04.406\nmuch block everybody to\neverything on the forums here.\n\n108\n00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:10.579\nBut I wanted to just block forums,\nif I can spell forums.itpro.tv,\n\n109\n00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:15.100\nand then I could actually\ndo a sub-path like this.\n\n110\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.197\nI could block just a Cisco one if I wanted\nto and add something like that in there.\n\n111\n00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.550\nSo I could do that, and that way I'm\njust blocking that one if I want to.\n\n112\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.877\nBut if I wanted to allow them\n\n113\n00:06:29.877 --> 00:06:34.965\naccess into forums.itprotv.\n\n114\n00:06:34.965 --> 00:06:38.685\nI don't know why my typing is\nreally more challenging here.\n\n115\n00:06:38.685 --> 00:06:39.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n116\n00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:43.789\nI just wanted them to be able to see that\nfirst one, but not go anywhere else.\n\n117\n00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:48.150\nThen I could also add in the asterisk\nthere at the end if I wanted to as well.\n\n118\n00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.460\nSo that way or even just to like\nthe subset like what they said,\n\n119\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.100\nis get access to that but\nI wanna block everything else after that.\n\n120\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.260\nWell, I could do that too.\n\n121\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.760\nSo those are all possibilities if we\nwanted to be able to do something\n\n122\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.750\nlike that.\n\n123\n00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.500\nAnd give them access to the site but not\naccess to anything else that we wanted.\n\n124\n00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.930\nBut just make sure you pay attention,\n\n125\n00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.640\nclick on that little link make\nsure it makes sense to you.\n\n126\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.990\nBecause you will get scenario\nlike questions that may ask,\n\n127\n00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.480\nwhich of the following would\neffectively allow you to block this?\n\n128\n00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.920\nBut give them still access to\nsomething like that right?\n\n129\n00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.100\nSo now that we have an understanding\nthat those rules are also gonna apply.\n\n130\n00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.690\nWhen we talk about another situation,\nanother scenario, which is what we had\n\n131\n00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.740\nmentioned in even the previous episode\nthat we'll need to mention again here.\n\n132\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.035\nNow let's say that we blocked everything\njust like we had at the beginning,\n\n133\n00:07:40.035 --> 00:07:42.430\nforums.itpro.tv.\n\n134\n00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.100\nAnd once that's done,\nnow you have a group of users that say,\n\n135\n00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.990\nhey, part of my job is scouring\nthrough forums.itprotv.\n\n136\n00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.220\nBut, now you've blocked it and\n\n137\n00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.120\nI can't get access to that anymore through\nthe links that people are sending me.\n\n138\n00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.220\nAnd that's what happens to me,\ntoo, is not the blocking.\n\n139\n00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.494\nBut sometimes, I get a link in an email.\n\n140\n00:08:02.494 --> 00:08:06.753\nAnd I actually do send out links, though,\nfrom forums.ITProTV a lot of times.\n\n141\n00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:09.786\nAnd if I click on that and this says,\nit doesn't show up for you, well,\n\n142\n00:08:09.786 --> 00:08:12.230\nthat could be that it's\nblocked at some point.\n\n143\n00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.995\nSo what if that was part of your job which\nwas to go to that but not everybody could?\n\n144\n00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:21.220\n&gt;&gt; Right, and then I mean,\nyou don't want to just allow,\n\n145\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.430\nput a blanket policy out there,\nyour default policy to allow everyone,\n\n146\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.460\nwhen there may be a reason why you\nhad blocked it in the first place.\n\n147\n00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.130\nAnd you're just allowing\nsome exceptions for\n\n148\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.490\nthose user who have to have that access.\n\n149\n00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so this is where we\nhave to be able to change up and\n\n150\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.010\nexcept to create exceptions to\nthe default rules that we have, okay.\n\n151\n00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:48.110\nAnd the way that we do that, because of\nmy scaling it worked out just fine here.\n\n152\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.890\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n153\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.890\n&gt;&gt; You put some blinders on us.\n\n154\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know, on purpose I was.\n\n155\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.040\nBut if I scroll down\nunderneath that default rule.\n\n156\n00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.450\nLet me get out of this.\n\n157\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.230\nI don't want to save this.\n\n158\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.950\nLet me get out of that completly.\n\n159\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.500\nIf I scroll down underneath\nthe default role,\n\n160\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.980\nnow we have policies that\napply to specific recipients.\n\n161\n00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.790\nSo, now we can create that exception,\nwhich I've made sure I'm saying that.\n\n162\n00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.480\nI was about to say\nthe default to the default.\n\n163\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.620\nThat would've been terrible.\n\n164\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.120\nPay an exception to\nthe default by using this one,\n\n165\n00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.240\nremember this is directly underneath that,\nokay?\n\n166\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.900\nSo, you might have actually\nheard in the past and\n\n167\n00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.500\nat some point this naming change where\nit talks about do not rewrite the url.\n\n168\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.470\nWait a minute, let me make sure\nI'm telling you correctly here.\n\n169\n00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:36.420\n&gt;&gt; It sounds about right.\n\n170\n00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, do not rewrite urls.\n\n171\n00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:43.750\nNow if you see that link instead, well\nyou might be referring to the same thing.\n\n172\n00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.420\nThis is where you set that up.\n\n173\n00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.940\nIf you need to set up a do not\nrewrite type of url that means\n\n174\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.120\nmake an exception to the rule,\nthat's what that means.\n\n175\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.170\nYou are going to click plus here.\n\n176\n00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:03.180\nAnd then, let's go ahead and say, let's\ndo that idea that I was saying, marketing\n\n177\n00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:11.500\nexception to the default, all right.\n\n178\n00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.850\nSo now, it says I specified the name\nof the safe link policy, and\n\n179\n00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.770\nI could actually add the description here.\n\n180\n00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.990\nAll of this is good stuff that, yes,\n\n181\n00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.340\nif you can take the time to do this,\nyou should document.\n\n182\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:28.160\nThat way, if you happen to be promoted,\nyou don't have to deal with Office 365,\n\n183\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.410\nwell now I know the reason for\nthis policy is.\n\n184\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.110\nDon't get me wrong,\nthe name should be enough.\n\n185\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:38.160\nBut if you had to have a reason for\nit or you just wanted to document this.\n\n186\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.850\nSo when did this policy get implemented.\n\n187\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.930\nYou may want to go ahead and even type\nin like dates or stuff in here too.\n\n188\n00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.530\n&gt;&gt; And how do you do a demo to me, Ronnie?\n\n189\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:46.500\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n190\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.360\nWe could've done that, too,\nbut let's not do that.\n\n191\n00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:55.080\nSelect the action for unknown\npotentially malicious URLs in messages.\n\n192\n00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.650\nSo here, it's saying, hey, what do we\nactually want to do here, okay, for\n\n193\n00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.490\npotentially unknown URLs in messages?\n\n194\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.060\nRight now, there's nothing.\n\n195\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.730\nIt says it's off, right.\n\n196\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.960\nAnd then I can choose this one,\nwhich is the on.\n\n197\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.030\nSays urls will be rewritten and\n\n198\n00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:18.780\nchecked against a list of known malicious\nlinks when a user clicks on the link.\n\n199\n00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.350\nAnd then we have safe attachments and\n\n200\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.140\nthen we had do not track users\nwhen they click on safe links.\n\n201\n00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.450\nAnd I continue to scroll down,\n\n202\n00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.700\nthat is where we say that unusual\nverbiage that I was talking.\n\n203\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.920\nLet me see if I can scroll down here.\n\n204\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.110\nDo not rewrite the following URLs.\n\n205\n00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.740\nSo it's right here that I may want to\ngo ahead and enter in that valid one.\n\n206\n00:11:43.795 --> 00:11:47.608\nSo for forums.itpro.tv.\n\n207\n00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:51.320\nLet's add that one in here.\n\n208\n00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:58.220\nAnd then this is where\nyou add in the exceptions\n\n209\n00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.780\nthat you also want right here too.\n\n210\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.830\nSo specify the users, groups, or\ndomains to whom this policy applies.\n\n211\n00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:10.560\nIf the recipient is a member of,\n\n212\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.030\nso now I can select those people, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.810\nSo I might have a group here, I don't\nhave an actual marketing group somewhere.\n\n214\n00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.180\nI will put them in a support team,\nlet's do that instead.\n\n215\n00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.270\nIt would be nice if I actually had\ndone the idea of the right one, but\n\n216\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.330\nlet's just say that, and\n\n217\n00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.980\nwe'll change the exception to-\n&gt;&gt; Support team.\n\n218\n00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.146\n&gt;&gt; Support team.\n\n219\n00:12:37.928 --> 00:12:42.165\nYep, exception to the default, so\n\n220\n00:12:42.165 --> 00:12:47.030\nthere is that one conidtion, okay?\n\n221\n00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.010\nExcept if, and\n\n222\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.300\nthen notice that you can also add in\nanother exception if you want to, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.390\nSo now, this is where it says\ndon't rewrite for the forms.url,\n\n224\n00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:01.440\nif the recipient is a member\nof support team, okay?\n\n225\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.010\nFrom that point that's where you\nwould go ahead and save this, and\n\n226\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.250\nnow, once you actually save it, okay?\n\n227\n00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:11.130\nThat should take, remember,\nabout 30 minutes, it's possible,\n\n228\n00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.830\nit takes up to about 30 minutes.\n\n229\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.710\nOr something like this applies and\n\n230\n00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.810\nnow you can see over here on the let's\nsee if I can scroll the whole thing.\n\n231\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.640\nI don't think I was able\nto do that very well.\n\n232\n00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.580\nSo just a little bit\nbehind my head over here.\n\n233\n00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.665\nWe'll take a look at the Applied To.\n\n234\n00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:31.405\nIf this message is set\nto a member of a group,\n\n235\n00:13:31.405 --> 00:13:36.310\nsupport@officepro.microsoft.com, take\nthe following actions.\n\n236\n00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.140\nWhich is to apply that\nparticular rule that we did,\n\n237\n00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.813\nwhich was to actually have that\nexception to forms at itprobe.tv.\n\n238\n00:13:45.813 --> 00:13:51.000\nAnd that way we can make sure that this\ngroup actually gets it in there to, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.710\nSo it's really good for\nus to at least be able to understand\n\n240\n00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:59.410\nhow something like this works\nin terms of Safe Links go, okay.\n\n241\n00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:04.480\nSo that is part of using\nsomething like ATP for Safe Links.\n\n242\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.910\nNow, I'm gonna click back on Home for\na moment, and\n\n243\n00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.810\nlet's take a look at the other\npolicy that we have here.\n\n244\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:16.320\nUnder Threat Management,\nand then Policies,\n\n245\n00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.340\nremember that we also talked about\nthe idea of ATP safe attachments, right?\n\n246\n00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:27.210\nProtect your organization from malicious\ncontent in email attachments and files and\n\n247\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.160\nOneDrive and Teams.\n\n248\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.540\nAnd, once again, I have to click\non the icon instead of the link.\n\n249\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.170\nThat looks like it's gonna do there.\n\n250\n00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.749\nAnd this one is, again,\nkind of fairly easy for us to think about.\n\n251\n00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.180\nUsers paid to protect their organization\nfrom malicious content and email\n\n252\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.920\nattachments like SharePoint, OneDrive,\nMicrosoft Team, to protect files.\n\n253\n00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.430\nIf any file in SharePoint, OneDrive,\n\n254\n00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.430\nMicrosoft Teams,\nis identified as malicious.\n\n255\n00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.170\nATP will prevent users from opening or\ndownloading\n\n256\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:03.330\nWhen we want to turn something like that\non we simply go ahead and do this as well.\n\n257\n00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:03.850\nNow notice,\n\n258\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:08.500\nthis is not really affecting the idea\nof emails here, wanna go to emails?\n\n259\n00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.170\nYou need to go to\nthe Exchange admin center and\n\n260\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.440\nconfigure the email at that point for\nthose particular attachments.\n\n261\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:23.140\nThen See if I can scroll down\nhere a little bit more and\n\n262\n00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.960\nsee what else we have access to.\n\n263\n00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.960\nLooks like my screen is kind\nof cutting off something here.\n\n264\n00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.720\nLet me see if I can get out of\nthis zoom for just a moment and\n\n265\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.408\nsee what else is hiding where\nI can't get access to it.\n\n266\n00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:43.450\nAll right, let's see here.\n\n267\n00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.400\nYou got a little bit more real estate.\n\n268\n00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.020\nNo.\nThat's why.\n\n269\n00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.920\nThe session has timed out here.\n\n270\n00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.936\nLet's do this again.\n\n271\n00:15:55.023 --> 00:15:56.400\nSafe attachments.\n\n272\n00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.340\nAll right, if there's anything else here.\n\n273\n00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.000\nIt doesn't look like it.\n\n274\n00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.480\nLet's see what happens when\nI click on this plus sign.\n\n275\n00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.057\nHere we go.\n\n276\n00:16:04.057 --> 00:16:09.519\nSo you can even actually create a new safe\nlink or a safe attachment policy as well.\n\n277\n00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:12.658\nAnd add it in at this particular point,\ntoo.\n\n278\n00:16:12.658 --> 00:16:15.370\nSo if gives you that\nability to create one.\n\n279\n00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:21.353\nNow, let's just say, New policy\n\n280\n00:16:24.271 --> 00:16:26.640\nAnd safe detachments known.\n\n281\n00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.350\nUnknown malware response.\n\n282\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.780\nSelect the action for the attachment here.\n\n283\n00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.490\nAnd I can even put warnings on it,\nif I want to.\n\n284\n00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.130\nWhy is it not liking my name here?\n\n285\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.958\nThis field is required.\n\n286\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.710\n&gt;&gt; You can't just leave it\nat that default new policy.\n\n287\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.580\n&gt;&gt; This new policy.\n\n288\n00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.460\nThere we go, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.947\nThen from that point,\nlet's see if I Tab through.\n\n290\n00:16:50.947 --> 00:16:56.190\nIt says, see set actions for\nunknown malware policies.\n\n291\n00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:59.070\nAnd the only thing that it's actually\nallowing me to do at this point, right,\n\n292\n00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.370\nis to just kinda read about it.\n\n293\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.620\nBut if I scroll down here,\nokay, this is where we can,\n\n294\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.390\nof course, create warnings for it.\n\n295\n00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:10.690\nWe can redirect the attachment on\ndetection, send the block monitor, or\n\n296\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.150\nplace attachment to an email address.\n\n297\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.830\nAnd that might be for further scanning.\n\n298\n00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:21.235\nApply the above selection of malware\nscanning attachment times out during\n\n299\n00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:22.230\nan error.\n\n300\n00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:26.430\nSo then you can set additional\nconditions at that point,\n\n301\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.855\nwhether they're a part of that group.\n\n302\n00:17:27.855 --> 00:17:34.250\nOr the recipient is a particular person or\na member of or the domain, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.670\nAll of those are, again,\npossible possibilities there.\n\n304\n00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.386\nAnd then you can go back and\n\n305\n00:17:39.386 --> 00:17:43.440\nmassage it to kind of tweak\nit to what you need it to be.\n\n306\n00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.430\nBut all of those that are possible\nconfigurations that you can see there.\n\n307\n00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.915\nBut I really want to center in on the idea\nof the links here because that's more than\n\n308\n00:17:51.915 --> 00:17:55.238\nlikely what you'll generally\nend up seeing, more likely.\n\n309\n00:17:55.238 --> 00:17:58.143\nBecause when we're getting into\nthis a little bit more and\n\n310\n00:17:58.143 --> 00:18:02.117\nit's hard not to jump ahead, but we're\ngonna go into Exchange Admin Center and\n\n311\n00:18:02.117 --> 00:18:05.450\nset up some different filtering\nin there in a few episodes.\n\n312\n00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.600\nBut I don't wanna jump in there.\n\n313\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.540\nBut one last thing we wanna show you of\ncourse, here inside of the Security and\n\n314\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.940\nCompliance Center, everything right here,\nlike safe attachments and\n\n315\n00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.130\nsafe links that have this yellow bar\n&gt;&gt; It just got better.\n\n316\n00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.456\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it just got better.\n\n317\n00:18:18.456 --> 00:18:21.245\nAnd it's saying, hey, you should take\na look at the idea of reports in\n\n318\n00:18:21.245 --> 00:18:23.790\nSecurity and Compliance for\nenhanced reporting.\n\n319\n00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:28.607\nSo if I select Reports,\nthis is where you can scroll down.\n\n320\n00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:31.180\nAnd I'll select the dashboard once again.\n\n321\n00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.240\nAnd it's inside of here.\n\n322\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.180\nIt really doesn't kind\nof test us too much.\n\n323\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.152\nBut notice there's\nnothing really going on.\n\n324\n00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:42.980\nBut note here the ATP file types.\n\n325\n00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.890\nSo malicious URLs, executables, and\n\n326\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.990\nattachments, Word attachments,\nyou name it.\n\n327\n00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.900\nAll of Office,\neven flash attachments are here.\n\n328\n00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:54.370\nMessage disposition, telling you,\nhey, how did we treat this message?\n\n329\n00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:59.630\nProtection status,\nput up protection status and it actually\n\n330\n00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:05.410\ntells you safe attachments, anti-malware\nengine, safe link zap, phishing.\n\n331\n00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:09.524\nAll these are a part of understanding\nthat idea of the report.\n\n332\n00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:12.634\nAnd, of course, you can start to put\nthese dashboards up there to give\n\n333\n00:19:12.634 --> 00:19:14.870\nyou a nice visual representation.\n\n334\n00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.300\nAnd if you really go,\n\n335\n00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.598\nhey, I need more than just this\nkind of summary of information.\n\n336\n00:19:22.342 --> 00:19:24.400\nWe go back and find that again.\n\n337\n00:19:26.409 --> 00:19:27.490\nScroll down.\n\n338\n00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:31.535\nNotice that you can also get reports for\ndownload.\n\n339\n00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:35.575\nAnd then from this point, if you actually\ndid have everything set up, you could\n\n340\n00:19:35.575 --> 00:19:40.130\ngo ahead and even download reports as\nyou've actually created them, too.\n\n341\n00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.961\nSo it is a little bit more advanced.\n\n342\n00:19:41.961 --> 00:19:45.451\nIt gives you much more granularity in\nseeing some of the information that you\n\n343\n00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:46.650\nwant to see.\n\n344\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.484\nSo don't take the idea of advanced threat\nprotection as something that you might not\n\n345\n00:19:50.484 --> 00:19:51.032\nneed to do.\n\n346\n00:19:51.032 --> 00:19:54.466\nEspecially when it comes down to the exam,\nrealize that most of the time when we\n\n347\n00:19:54.466 --> 00:19:58.460\ndo it, especially for something like\nSafe Links, you can set a default policy.\n\n348\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.280\nAnd then if you need to set an exception,\nyou're gonna have to scroll down a little\n\n349\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.870\nbit further and\ncreate the exception right there as well.\n\n350\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.780\nBut make sure you go over this material.\n\n351\n00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.840\nAnd make sure you actually\ndo take a look at it,\n\n352\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.020\nespecially when you're preparing for\nthat 347 exam.\n\n353\n00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.039\nIs really going to, 347, yeah.\n\n354\n00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:18.380\nI was gonna say,\nwhy does that not sound right?\n\n355\n00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.665\nBut 70-347 exam, all these are gonna\nbe part of you understanding and\n\n356\n00:20:21.665 --> 00:20:24.039\nbeing able to configure\nadvanced threat protection.\n\n357\n00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:27.193\nSo that's a great example for\nus, and that's a great place for\n\n358\n00:20:27.193 --> 00:20:29.763\nus to kinda wrap that\nparticular portion up, too.\n\n359\n00:20:29.763 --> 00:20:30.610\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool, Ronnie.\n\n360\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.987\nThank you for\nintroducing me to this new ATP concept.\n\n361\n00:20:33.987 --> 00:20:35.640\nHopefully, you guys enjoyed it as well.\n\n362\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.850\nBut for this show, We'll sign out.\n\n363\n00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.550\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n364\n00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.470\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n365\n00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.110\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n366\n00:20:42.110 -->

00:00:06.090\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.712\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:12.320\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone,\n\n7\n00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.390\nand welcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.600\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're continuing on\n\n9\n00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.730\nwith more in our Enabling Office\n365 Services series.\n\n10\n00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.430\nJoining us back in the studio,\nletting his expertise hone that for\n\n11\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.040\nus, our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.957\nRonnie welcome back man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:32.320\n&gt;&gt; It is going well Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.388\nThank you for having me back on the show\nas we continue on taking a look at course\n\n15\n00:00:36.388 --> 00:00:37.653\nupdating this series.\n\n16\n00:00:37.653 --> 00:00:41.931\nAnd now, we're heading into this\nparticular topic where we're gonna be\n\n17\n00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:45.700\ntalking about of course\nimplementing Microsoft Teams.\n\n18\n00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.894\nNow, if you're saying Microsoft Teams,\nRonnie, you've done this entire series,\n\n19\n00:00:50.894 --> 00:00:55.606\nand this is the first time we've mentioned\nMicrosoft Teams, and I remember-\n\n20\n00:00:55.606 --> 00:00:56.631\n&gt;&gt; It's groups of people from Microsoft-\n\n21\n00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you would think so.\n\n22\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.370\n&gt;&gt; That come when you call them,\nthey come to you.\n\n23\n00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.695\n&gt;&gt; And the amazing-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:01.671\n&gt;&gt; Thing is, right,\n\n25\n00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:05.636\nis probably something else that you've\nalso noticed is that all of a sudden,\n\n26\n00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:08.632\nif you've been taking a while and\nstudying for this exam.\n\n27\n00:01:08.632 --> 00:01:11.670\nYou actually ended up seeing that\nMicrosoft Teams wasn't something that\n\n28\n00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.670\nappeared maybe when you first\nstarted studying for the exam.\n\n29\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.197\nAnd now,\nyou kind of go into portal.office.com,\n\n30\n00:01:18.197 --> 00:01:22.538\nand they're all, what is this about,\nthis is just showing up?\n\n31\n00:01:22.538 --> 00:01:25.013\n&gt;&gt; I feel like it's the scenario where\nyou're like an office worker, and\n\n32\n00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:26.301\nthey give you this big pile of files.\n\n33\n00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:29.133\nAnd you're on your last one,\nyou think, man, I've got this, and\n\n34\n00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.090\nsomebody comes in a slams another pile on,\nthere you go.\n\n35\n00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.766\n&gt;&gt; Bingo, kinda thing.\n\n36\n00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:37.030\nThat's exactly what's happening here,\nso you are also seeing that as well.\n\n37\n00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.370\nNow, it wasn't long ago, okay,\nwhat really started to happen,\n\n38\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.420\nof course, is Skype for Business,\n\n39\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.350\nis kind of that main communication tools\nthat they want people to rely on, right?\n\n40\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.828\nTo do inter-office conversations,\nvideo conferencing, phone conferencing.\n\n41\n00:01:53.828 --> 00:01:56.960\nBeing able to share stuff if they need to,\npresentations.\n\n42\n00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.906\nAll that is great stuff, and so, Skype for\nBusiness is kind of the main tool\n\n43\n00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:05.454\nthat they've really been pushing for\nquite a while.\n\n44\n00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:07.163\nIt's been in development for\nquite a while.\n\n45\n00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:11.863\nIt's not exactly something that's brand\nnew before this point in time where Skype\n\n46\n00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:13.339\nfor Business came along,\n\n47\n00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.870\nwe had another product that was\nfirst called Microsoft Lync.\n\n48\n00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.860\nSo Lync ended up essentially getting\nchanged over to Skype for Business.\n\n49\n00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.620\nAnd now, Skype for\n\n50\n00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.990\nBusiness is turning into-\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft Teams.\n\n51\n00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.090\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft Teams, so\nit continues in its development.\n\n52\n00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.210\nAnd in the background of Skype for\nBusiness,\n\n53\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.600\nif you're running the PowerShell, right?\n\n54\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.840\nYou're seeing that it actually\nis saying something like,\n\n55\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.260\nyou're going to link,\nis what you're doing.\n\n56\n00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.350\nSo even the infrastructure in the\nbackground isn't fully converted over, or\n\n57\n00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.260\nthey've just said,\nwe'll just port that over,\n\n58\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.210\nand that will actually make it\nwork the way that we want to.\n\n59\n00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.070\nSo now, they've decided most recently\nthat, look Skype for Business is good.\n\n60\n00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.190\nIt's what we would want, but\n\n61\n00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.550\nwe're starting to see that\nthe world is changing.\n\n62\n00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.640\nAnd that what we actually are seeing\nis something a little bit slimmer,\n\n63\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.160\na little bit more friendly, and\nmore user friendly at this point.\n\n64\n00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.100\nAnd people actually liking another way\nto go with this type of communications.\n\n65\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.009\nSo they, of course, have ended up\ncreating what they call Microsoft Teams.\n\n66\n00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:18.314\nNow, all the features that you think\nabout inside of Microsoft Business,\n\n67\n00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:21.610\nyou'll have those features\ninside of Microsoft Teams.\n\n68\n00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.150\nBut implemented a little bit differently,\n\n69\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.190\na little bit more in line with the way\nthat people tend to work as well.\n\n70\n00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.260\nAnd there's another product that's\nactually been out there for\n\n71\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.140\na while that they're\nreally mimicking overall.\n\n72\n00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.590\nAnd it's not exactly one\nthat we like to kind go,\n\n73\n00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.190\nthat's exactly what they're doing.\n\n74\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.518\nBut I'm not gonna say a name, Daniel.\n\n75\n00:03:43.518 --> 00:03:46.851\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But as you look at it and you go,\n\n76\n00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:51.786\nI've seen this used in our organization\nand it looks really familiar,\n\n77\n00:03:51.786 --> 00:03:53.853\nit looks insanely familiar.\n\n78\n00:03:53.853 --> 00:03:58.390\nAnd you'll start to see what I'm talking\nabout as we go on through here, okay.\n\n79\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.293\nSo what you're actually seeing is that,\nokay?\n\n80\n00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:02.000\nAnd this change is coming about.\n\n81\n00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.990\nNow, it's not fully implemented yet inside\nof Office 365, Skype for Business, and\n\n82\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.800\nthe transition is coming probably in\nthis upcoming calendar year, okay.\n\n83\n00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.447\nSo for us we finished the actual\noriginal 347 series about\n\n84\n00:04:17.447 --> 00:04:21.010\nprobably about eight months ago,\na overall.\n\n85\n00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.111\nAnd we've now added in this addition\nbecause they've changed the exam, and\n\n86\n00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:26.140\nthat's why we're updating the show too.\n\n87\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.130\nAnd now also the course includes\nin the idea of Microsoft Teams.\n\n88\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.210\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nthat implementation model, and\n\n89\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.940\nwhat we have to do to get it up and\nworking for our organization too.\n\n90\n00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.490\nSo it's not super difficult.\n\n91\n00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.902\nAnd for those of you who are already\nfamiliar with another inter office\n\n92\n00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:50.026\ncommunication tool, you're gonna go,\nwow, that looks easy.\n\n93\n00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:52.882\nI know exactly what that's doing.\n\n94\n00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:55.230\nYou're gonna see that that's\nexactly what is gonna happen.\n\n95\n00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.560\nBut before we get started, it doesn't\nhappen for everybody in your organization.\n\n96\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.770\nSo within your Office 365 tenancy, of\ncourse, remember that every user that you\n\n97\n00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.680\nadd in has to have a subscription\nplan of some sort.\n\n98\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.420\nAnd it's only those subscription\nplans that include Microsoft Teams.\n\n99\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.820\nWill they be able to get access to it, so\nthey don't have this types of subscription\n\n100\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.670\nplans then they won't be\nable to have access to it.\n\n101\n00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.405\nAnd at that point,\nthey'll have to either purchase and\n\n102\n00:05:23.405 --> 00:05:27.470\nadd-in which is probably what it is like\n$4 extra month or something like that.\n\n103\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.910\nAnd they'll be able to do that but\n\n104\n00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.470\nit's not included natively\nin that subscription.\n\n105\n00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.850\nSo let's take a look at my computer,\nand let's make sure that we understand\n\n106\n00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.050\nabout these different features and\nwhere we'll tend to see this.\n\n107\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.183\nWith Microsoft Teams, and\nhere's actually a great place to start,\n\n108\n00:05:41.183 --> 00:05:42.560\nI just use my search\nengine that I wanted to.\n\n109\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:51.279\nAnd I just typed in Office\n365 subscription plans, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.440\nAnd that automatically\nbrought me up to here.\n\n111\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.910\nProbably kind of the four most\npopular plans that we see\n\n112\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.680\non the commercial side of things, okay.\n\n113\n00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.314\nOver on the left-hand side over here,\nlet me see if I can zoom in, oops.\n\n114\n00:06:04.314 --> 00:06:05.890\nZoomed in too much, okay.\n\n115\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.102\n&gt;&gt; When zoomed on-\n&gt;&gt; On the left-hand side,\n\n116\n00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:12.415\nnotice that they also have other\noptions for small business, education,\n\n117\n00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:16.940\ngovernment, non-profit, home, and\nof course, even first line workers.\n\n118\n00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.364\nThat's a new category that I don't\nactually remember seeing before in\n\n119\n00:06:20.364 --> 00:06:20.883\nthis one.\n\n120\n00:06:20.883 --> 00:06:23.410\nSo you're actually seeing that\nthey're continuing to expand this.\n\n121\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.300\nBut the goal is, of course, for us to find\nout which of these products includes,\n\n122\n00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.340\nof course, Microsoft Teams.\n\n123\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.569\nSo I have here of course E1, E3, E5,\nand then the Office ProPlus Edition.\n\n124\n00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.951\nThose are probably the most common ones\nthat we'll see inside of an office tenancy\n\n125\n00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:43.015\nfor a regular standard business\nthat we tend to get here.\n\n126\n00:06:43.015 --> 00:06:48.007\nIf I scroll down through here, what we're\nlooking for, of course, are where it says,\n\n127\n00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:50.330\nOffice applications included.\n\n128\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.500\nAnd now, if we start to see\nOffice applications included,\n\n129\n00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.060\nnotice that they pretty much include\njust about everything, okay?\n\n130\n00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.600\nUntil you get to E1 notice that E1\ndoesn't include essentially Office 2016,\n\n131\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.550\nit just doesn't have it in there.\n\n132\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.260\nSo you'd actually have to purchase\nthat as a kind of addition\n\n133\n00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.920\nof product if you want to in that one.\n\n134\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.800\nBut now under services Included,\nthis is what you're looking for\n\n135\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.490\nis the icon right here where\nit says Microsoft Teams.\n\n136\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.940\nSo notice that this is included in E1,\nE3, and E5 license.\n\n137\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.507\nBut it's not included in the ProPlus plan,\nokay?\n\n138\n00:07:25.507 --> 00:07:27.090\nAnd a lot of offices do that.\n\n139\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.100\nThey might give a few people,\nsuch as supervisors, an E3 or\n\n140\n00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.490\nE5, or whatever one that gives\nthem the best bang for the buck.\n\n141\n00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.730\nBut just about everybody else, they might\nuse Skype for Business or if they're\n\n142\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.650\nactually also of course, using exchange,\nthey might also have that in there.\n\n143\n00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.981\nSo, E1 may actually be there, but\nthat's what you're looking for,\n\n144\n00:07:46.981 --> 00:07:47.991\nof course, is that.\n\n145\n00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:50.956\nSo in the small business\nplan side of things,\n\n146\n00:07:50.956 --> 00:07:55.070\nlet me scroll back up to the top here,\nor close to the top.\n\n147\n00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.175\nLet's go ahead and\nclick on the small business side so\n\n148\n00:07:58.175 --> 00:07:59.839\nthat we can see this as well.\n\n149\n00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:02.705\nIf you are helping a small business,\nand they say hey,\n\n150\n00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:04.948\nwe'd like to implement Microsoft teams,\n\n151\n00:08:04.948 --> 00:08:09.020\nyou wanna remember that there's\nalso three of those models as well.\n\n152\n00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.910\nAnd where we'll see this of course\nis in the Business Essentials plan,\n\n153\n00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:17.540\nand in in the Business Premium, but\nnot in the regular Office 365 Business.\n\n154\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.679\nAnd let's scroll down and you'll see\nright here once again under services,\n\n155\n00:08:21.679 --> 00:08:23.343\nwhere it has Microsoft Teams.\n\n156\n00:08:23.343 --> 00:08:27.317\nNow there's only one other one that\nI'm going to point out because for me,\n\n157\n00:08:27.317 --> 00:08:31.371\nthe government one doesn't really tend\nto influence what I'm going to do.\n\n158\n00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:34.380\nBut more than likely for\nthe rest of us it really will, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.670\nSo here it is.\n\n160\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.640\nThere's also education.\n\n161\n00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.070\nSo if you're setting this up for\na school, you may also choose of course\n\n162\n00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.290\nthe idea of the educational\nplans that you might also see.\n\n163\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.986\nAnd here they've actually kind of\nrenamed this, of course, as A1 and\n\n164\n00:08:52.986 --> 00:08:57.778\nA3 and A5, hope I've selected there,\nyeah, for the entire school.\n\n165\n00:08:57.778 --> 00:09:02.708\nIf I scroll down, you'll once again take\na look and notice that all three of these\n\n166\n00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:06.406\nalso include of course teams for\nthe entire government, and\n\n167\n00:09:06.406 --> 00:09:10.347\nof course even includes those\nnon-profit organizations too.\n\n168\n00:09:10.347 --> 00:09:12.304\nAnd then there is government\nmodels that have there, and\n\n169\n00:09:12.304 --> 00:09:15.380\nthat's just on a different level,\nwe're not have to worry about that one.\n\n170\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.230\nBut make sure you pay attention,\nespecially on this one.\n\n171\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.800\nThis is probably the big one that\nthey want you to know about, right?\n\n172\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.760\nSo of all three of these plans,\n\n173\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.260\nthe Office Pro Plus is probably\nthe one that doesn't have it, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.889\nSo if that's the only\nsubscription that you have, and\n\n175\n00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:32.274\nyou're using this, as trying to learn and\nget ready to be certified.\n\n176\n00:09:32.274 --> 00:09:35.708\nYou'll probably need to see if you\ncan bump to to the E1 at least,\n\n177\n00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:39.531\nif you want to get in there and play\nwith it yourself and be able to do that.\n\n178\n00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:42.482\nAnd it's actually very possible,\nespecially when you set up one of\n\n179\n00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:45.510\nthose tendencies that we've done,\nwhich is a trial subscription.\n\n180\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:50.450\nThey normally grant you, it's either\n25 E-3 licenses that you can use, or\n\n181\n00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.562\n25 E-1 licenses for\nthat period of 30 days.\n\n182\n00:09:53.562 --> 00:09:57.051\nSo, you'll have the ability to\ndo this without extra costs, and\n\n183\n00:09:57.051 --> 00:10:01.123\npretty much completely free if you are\ndoing this for your trial as you do it.\n\n184\n00:10:01.123 --> 00:10:05.054\nSo don't worry about the plan as long\nas you can do it within the thirty day\n\n185\n00:10:05.054 --> 00:10:05.920\nperiod.\n\n186\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.404\nCuz if you are already past that,\n\n187\n00:10:07.404 --> 00:10:10.840\nyou are already paying some money\nto be able to do this, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.585\nSo those licenses are pretty\nmuch key as we start doing it.\n\n189\n00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:16.150\nNow, what if you go hey,\n\n190\n00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.760\nI don't want any of that other stuff,\nI just want this as a stand alone product.\n\n191\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.590\nYou can't.\n\n192\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.590\nYou can't just join Office 365 and\ngo, I just want Microsoft teams,\n\n193\n00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.120\nI don't want any of it.\n\n194\n00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.080\nWell, that is kind of\nthe difference between this and\n\n195\n00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.720\nthe other competitive product\nthat we're talking about here,\n\n196\n00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.760\nwhereas that one is actually just\na standalone product by itself.\n\n197\n00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.430\nMicrosoft teams will not be, okay.\n\n198\n00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:43.163\nSo you will this as part of something else\nthat we have to be able to use here too.\n\n199\n00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:47.854\nNow, if you want to fully use\nall the features of Teams, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:47.854 --> 00:10:51.366\nIf you just want add the instant\nmessaging thing, it's not real big deal,\n\n201\n00:10:51.366 --> 00:10:53.310\nou don't really need much.\n\n202\n00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.519\nBut if you want to be able to use things\nlike file sharing and, of course,\n\n203\n00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:02.142\ncameras and everything else that you want\nto go into this, you wanna make sure,\n\n204\n00:11:02.142 --> 00:11:06.834\nof course, that you're going to have\nthat particular subscription account for\n\n205\n00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.301\nwhoever's doing this.\n\n206\n00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:13.140\nTo be able to have email as well as\naccess to the SharePoint storage, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.430\nThat you have available.\n\n208\n00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.591\nSo that's probably gonna be at\nleast E1 at the enterprise here,\n\n209\n00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:21.552\nif you actually start doing this,\nall right.\n\n210\n00:11:21.552 --> 00:11:25.055\nSo that's enough at least talking\nin terms of some of this stuff,\n\n211\n00:11:25.055 --> 00:11:26.849\nyou just gotta know for the exam.\n\n212\n00:11:26.849 --> 00:11:29.086\nI wish I could say\nthere's an easier way for\n\n213\n00:11:29.086 --> 00:11:32.795\nyou to know this without taking\na look at it, but there really isn't.\n\n214\n00:11:32.795 --> 00:11:36.125\n&gt;&gt; Really Ronnie, I think you're joking,\nI said, why don't they have an option?\n\n215\n00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:40.101\nA do this, B do that,\nC call Micosoft and ask them [LAUGH].\n\n216\n00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:41.819\nCuz in the real world,\nthat's what you would do.\n\n217\n00:11:41.819 --> 00:11:45.302\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the great thing is,\nyou're exactly right.\n\n218\n00:11:45.302 --> 00:11:49.372\nIf I close out of this and\nI launch the same link again,\n\n219\n00:11:49.372 --> 00:11:49.934\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n220\n00:11:49.934 --> 00:11:53.270\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna pop up a chat, that says,\nhey, what do you need help doing anyway?\n\n221\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.050\nSo, you can tell them, hey, this is\nwhat I need but I don't need all this.\n\n222\n00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.082\nAnd they'll probably be able even\nthrough their chat bot which\n\n223\n00:12:00.082 --> 00:12:02.710\nis essentially what it is,\nto be able to help you out and\n\n224\n00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.222\nfind the particular subscription\nplan you're generally looking for.\n\n225\n00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:10.020\nAnd if you're not ever sure, just like\nwhat Daniel was pointing out here,\n\n226\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.069\nover here in the lower left hand corner,\n\n227\n00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:14.752\nthis is probably regional\nmore than anything else.\n\n228\n00:12:14.752 --> 00:12:18.973\nBut notice you can select\nthis Chat now link here.\n\n229\n00:12:18.973 --> 00:12:22.348\nAnd once again, there it is,\nso now that I've zoomed in-\n\n230\n00:12:22.348 --> 00:12:23.271\n&gt;&gt; Now that you've zoomed in,\n\n231\n00:12:23.271 --> 00:12:23.890\n[CROSSTALK] crazy.\n\n232\n00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.832\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it went 900% in,\nthere we go, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:26.832 --> 00:12:30.720\nSo you can actually see that, and\nbe able to take the look as well,\n\n234\n00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.358\nand then they can help\nyou out if you need to.\n\n235\n00:12:33.358 --> 00:12:37.453\nAll right, so let's go into,\nof course, the portal.office.com,\n\n236\n00:12:37.453 --> 00:12:40.085\nto take a look at setting\nup Microsoft Teams.\n\n237\n00:12:40.085 --> 00:12:42.550\nSo once you are, of course there,\n\n238\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.790\nyou wanna verify whoever's actually\ngonna be doing this, right?\n\n239\n00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.370\nHas the subscription that they need to.\n\n240\n00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:53.960\nSo the way that I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna select admin.\n\n241\n00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:00.280\nAnd once that admin center comes up\nhere in just a magical moment [LAUGH].\n\n242\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.840\nI'm going to select Users over on the left\nhand side, and then Active Users.\n\n243\n00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.240\nAnd because I am impersonating Mr.\n\n244\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.415\nJoey Fatone himself,\nlet me see if I double click on him.\n\n245\n00:13:14.415 --> 00:13:19.760\nSo right here underneath product licences,\n\n246\n00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.650\nwe just want to confirm that\nwe have the right license.\n\n247\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.060\nYou don't have it, you're probably not\ngonna see, of course, the icon for it.\n\n248\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.491\nSo, just verify that you have the right\nlicense for this one that you need to.\n\n249\n00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:37.059\nSo mine has E5 as well as domestic calling\nplan I am good, and up, and ready to go.\n\n250\n00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:40.270\nAlright, so from that point\nlet's get back to the home here.\n\n251\n00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.780\nI can just close out of this and\nthat will make it easier.\n\n252\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.720\nNotice that on my screen I of\ncourse now all of these icons, or\n\n253\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.440\nthey're not exactly tiles anymore.\n\n254\n00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.470\nLinks, I guess,\nis probably the proper term for this.\n\n255\n00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.850\nIs where it says, Teams, I'm going to\nselect teams, and that will launch into,\n\n256\n00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.630\nof course, Teams here.\n\n257\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.538\nAll right, so here we are inside, and\n\n258\n00:14:02.538 --> 00:14:05.532\nyou'll actually end up seeing\nthat this has changed a bit.\n\n259\n00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:10.051\nNow when I first saw this, Daniel, it\npretty much looked exactly like Skype for\n\n260\n00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:12.823\nBusiness in the original\nimplementation of it.\n\n261\n00:14:12.823 --> 00:14:15.521\nBut now after a couple\nof months is changed and\n\n262\n00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:19.760\nit now actually still looks a little\nbit like Skype for Business.\n\n263\n00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.100\nOver here on the left hand side,\nthis is how Skype for\n\n264\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.170\nBusiness does continue\nto look a little bit.\n\n265\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.910\nBut now you're starting to\nsee a few other things.\n\n266\n00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.182\nNotice right here it has\nsomething like T-Bot.\n\n267\n00:14:29.182 --> 00:14:30.138\n&gt;&gt; T-Bot.\n\n268\n00:14:30.138 --> 00:14:30.904\n&gt;&gt; T-Bot.\nAnd\n\n269\n00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:35.742\nthis idea of T-Bot here is really\nkind of an assistant for you.\n\n270\n00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:40.318\nIt's automated type of system\nthat allows you to be able to ask\n\n271\n00:14:40.318 --> 00:14:42.254\nquestions if you need to.\n\n272\n00:14:42.254 --> 00:14:44.336\nAnd so they have something like T-Bot, and\n\n273\n00:14:44.336 --> 00:14:47.350\nthat third party product that\nI keep eluding to, right?\n\n274\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.490\nThey call their something else bot,\nas well, and\n\n275\n00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.200\nit really functions in the same way.\n\n276\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.370\nIf you're going hey,\nI wonder how I do this.\n\n277\n00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.960\nYou just go ahead and type in here, and\nsay hey let's go ahead and set this up.\n\n278\n00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.770\nAnd then you can begin to chat,\nyou can begin to do what else you need to,\n\n279\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.870\nit's all pretty much set up here\nright at the very beginning.\n\n280\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.890\nSo on the left-hand side,\nwe of course have a link for activity, so\n\n281\n00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.770\nthat you can see your current activity.\n\n282\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:15.920\nAny chats that you already have going,\nthat will also be here too.\n\n283\n00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.220\nAnd then of course, what we're really\nfocusing in on is the idea of teams.\n\n284\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.834\nNow, when we start seeing\nthis idea of teams,\n\n285\n00:15:22.834 --> 00:15:26.591\nit is because you have your\ngigantic organization, but usually,\n\n286\n00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:29.691\nthe communication that\nyou're really doing is what?\n\n287\n00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:32.951\nLimited to maybe could be you and\nme, direct messaging,\n\n288\n00:15:32.951 --> 00:15:33.519\n&gt;&gt; Direct messaging.\n\n289\n00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:34.167\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n290\n00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:37.801\n&gt;&gt; Or it could just be a sub-group\nof just a group, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:37.801 --> 00:15:42.400\nOf people that you generally work with,\nmight be department, maybe a particular so\n\n292\n00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.860\nlike you and I are edutainers, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.640\nWe have a development team and\n\n294\n00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.561\nthey might have their own particular Team\nas well that they actually end up using.\n\n295\n00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:56.492\nSo, but a lot of times you hear the term\nchannel instead of teams and stuff, and\n\n296\n00:15:56.492 --> 00:15:59.730\nit kinda works in that\nsame manner of system.\n\n297\n00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.564\nAs you start to do this, right?\n\n298\n00:16:01.564 --> 00:16:04.060\nSo when we start to implement a team,\nthe great thing is,\n\n299\n00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.700\nit's relatively intuitive here, just like\nit is in just about every other product\n\n300\n00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.820\nthat you can see that does this, here.\n\n301\n00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.950\nYou have two options.\n\n302\n00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.950\nYou can either create the team by of\ncourse clicking on this nice kind of\n\n303\n00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.410\npurplish link.\n\n304\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.230\nAt least on my screen on that monitor,\nactually looks blue to me.\n\n305\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.860\nAnd then, or you can actually select\ndown here in the lower left hand corner.\n\n306\n00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.220\nWhere it says, Create a team.\n\n307\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.700\nNow, to start create a team here.\n\n308\n00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.570\nSo either way will actually do that for\nyou.\n\n309\n00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.750\nSo you have those two options.\n\n310\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.100\nI don't know why they gave two\noptions like that, but why not?\n\n311\n00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.919\nI'll just select the ones.\n\n312\n00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:35.801\n&gt;&gt; Why not three at this point [LAUGH]?\n\n313\n00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:37.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why not, let's see.\n\n314\n00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.089\nIt won't let me add it down there so\nlet's create a team first.\n\n315\n00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.286\nSo, collaborate closely with a group\nof people inside your organization\n\n316\n00:16:45.286 --> 00:16:48.224\nbased on a project, initiative,\nor common interest, and\n\n317\n00:16:48.224 --> 00:16:50.305\nyou can of course watch a quick overview.\n\n318\n00:16:50.305 --> 00:16:54.713\nSo Daniel, you and I are going to\ncreate a team here, and since you and\n\n319\n00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:58.980\nI are edutainers, let's go ahead,\nand of course select it here.\n\n320\n00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:05.653\nSo, it's here in the description,\n\n321\n00:17:05.653 --> 00:17:09.313\nfor the show host and\n\n322\n00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:13.850\nSME's to communicate.\n\n323\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:14.920\nI can spell communicate.\n\n324\n00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.000\n&gt;&gt; It's the Norwegian version.\n\n325\n00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.142\n&gt;&gt; It could be, I do tend to be\nable to type in Norwegian at times.\n\n326\n00:17:21.142 --> 00:17:22.780\nThat would be strange,\nsince I can't speak it.\n\n327\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.525\n&gt;&gt; Lots of Js.\n\n328\n00:17:23.525 --> 00:17:25.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Lots of Js.\n\n329\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:26.100\nYeah.\n\n330\n00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.500\nSo we'll just do that description.\n\n331\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.680\nAnd that description, it probably\nreally does help in the long run,\n\n332\n00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.300\nespecially if you want a ton of teams,\nright?\n\n333\n00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.240\nAnd you have two or three people going,\nrock, eh, rock agitate, okay I get it,\n\n334\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.605\nI know what that's about.\n\n335\n00:17:39.605 --> 00:17:42.220\nBut development team, okay,\nyeah, that makes sense.\n\n336\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.250\nBut if you don't happen to do that and\nyou happen to be one of those people,\n\n337\n00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.540\nI'm gonna name it team one,\nteam two, team three.\n\n338\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.545\nDescription may be better.\n\n339\n00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:51.154\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that might be a little helpful.\n\n340\n00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:55.230\n&gt;&gt; Now, let's talk about this idea of\nprivacy here for a moment as well.\n\n341\n00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.270\nSo let me again kinda be\nvery careful with my zoom.\n\n342\n00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.130\nAnd let's see if I can now-\n&gt;&gt; Is that the place where we keep\n\n343\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.780\nthe government from spying\non what we're saying?\n\n344\n00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.570\n&gt;&gt; I would love to say that, yes.\n\n345\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.420\nSo down here at the bottom,\nthe idea of private.\n\n346\n00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.140\nRight now, under privacy,\nonly team owners can add members.\n\n347\n00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.900\nSo at this point, right?\n\n348\n00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.100\nI'm the one that's created it.\n\n349\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.850\nOr actually Joey and my persona here.\n\n350\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.440\nJoey is the one that created it.\n\n351\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.650\n&gt;&gt; Your alter ego.\n\n352\n00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.020\n&gt;&gt; My alternate ego.\n\n353\n00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:30.080\nWhat's the girl that did both,\nwhen she- on TV on the Disney Channel.\n\n354\n00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.260\nIt's Hannah.\n&gt;&gt; Hannah Montana.\n\n355\n00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:31.960\n&gt;&gt; Hannah Montana.\n\n356\n00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.592\nI don't remember who the other\ncharacter was supposed to be.\n\n357\n00:18:34.592 --> 00:18:35.843\n&gt;&gt; This is really Joey Portenell.\n\n358\n00:18:35.843 --> 00:18:38.844\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He's probably offended.\n\n359\n00:18:38.844 --> 00:18:42.405\n[LAUGH] So here we go.\n\n360\n00:18:42.405 --> 00:18:46.700\nSo, Private- Only team owners\ncan add members at this point.\n\n361\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.490\nNow that of course is up to you, but\n\n362\n00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.020\nnotice that you have this option as well,\nokay?\n\n363\n00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.390\nAnyone in your organization can join.\n\n364\n00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.640\nSo you can of course leave it open for\nanyone to join, or\n\n365\n00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.180\nyou can limit it to who you want to join.\n\n366\n00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.210\nNow on the public side,\nif you choose something like this,\n\n367\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.990\nyou can have up to 2500\npeople join this group.\n\n368\n00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.990\nI don't know why 2500 is the limit,\nbut that's the limit, okay?\n\n369\n00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.060\nBut if you have a group like that you\nprobably need to subdivide that team,\n\n370\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.960\njust a little bit more.\n\n371\n00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.750\n&gt;&gt; That's a big team.\n\n372\n00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.830\n&gt;&gt; That's a big team,\nto actually send out a message.\n\n373\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.655\nWho wants to go to lunch?\n\n374\n00:19:22.655 --> 00:19:25.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH[ Is it on the company?\n\n375\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:30.359\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right, all of a sudden\nit's like, what is this $40,000 bill?\n\n376\n00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:31.488\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n377\n00:19:31.488 --> 00:19:32.330\nThat would be cheap.\n\n378\n00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.720\nThat's, in the world, like,\nwhat, five, six bucks a person.\n\n379\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.715\n&gt;&gt; You're just supplying Panera bread,\nat that point.\n\n380\n00:19:38.715 --> 00:19:41.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now, let me see, if I scroll down.\n\n381\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.480\nSo at this point,\nlet's just leave it at this one.\n\n382\n00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.070\nOkay?\n\n383\n00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.690\nSo if you go, look, I want it public,\nanybody can join your team that chooses,\n\n384\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.300\nanybody in the organization that chooses,\nof course, can join.\n\n385\n00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.400\nPrivate, that actually sounds better for\nus right now.\n\n386\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.150\nCreate a team from\nthe existing Office group.\n\n387\n00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.857\nThis is also possible if you already have\ngroups that you've previously set up\n\n388\n00:20:01.857 --> 00:20:06.280\ninside of Office 365 cuz I don't\nwanna actually create one that's not\n\n389\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.302\ncreated, yet.\n\n390\n00:20:07.302 --> 00:20:10.590\nI already have groups that I've\nbeen using for other things.\n\n391\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.290\nYou can actually use that instead.\n\n392\n00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.590\nWe're just gonna create one from scratch.\n\n393\n00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.700\nAnd here at the beginning now,\n\n394\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:21.520\nI am actually creating\nthe team called Edutainers.\n\n395\n00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.780\nSo, at this point, let's see.\n\n396\n00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.910\nWe're gonna do Joey.\n\n397\n00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.050\nActually, I don't need to do Joey.\n\n398\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.170\nI need JT, is the one that I need here.\n\n399\n00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:35.420\nAnd the other one is Lance.\n\n400\n00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.550\nAnd if you are saying, holy mackerel,\nRonnie knows the names of all these\n\n401\n00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:43.212\npeople in this band which I actually\ndon't remember the name of,\n\n402\n00:20:43.212 --> 00:20:46.700\nI always want to say it's\nthe Back Street Boys but I'm wrong.\n\n403\n00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.580\n&gt;&gt; It's NSYNC.\n\n404\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.360\n&gt;&gt; It's NSYNC or 98 Degrees, that's\nthe other one I get it confused with.\n\n405\n00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.350\nSee, I don't really know these ones.\n\n406\n00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:56.370\nI know, this is all created for Vonne\nSmith, that's actually what this was for.\n\n407\n00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.390\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, she loves him.\n&gt;&gt; And then there is Justin,\n\n408\n00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:03.890\nJay, Joey, and there's one more,\nwhich is, is it?\n\n409\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:04.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n410\n00:21:04.546 --> 00:21:05.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Jace?\n\n411\n00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.066\n&gt;&gt; Joey.\n\n412\n00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:08.100\n&gt;&gt; J, JC.\n\n413\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.378\n&gt;&gt; JC.\n\n414\n00:21:09.378 --> 00:21:11.577\n&gt;&gt; It's J-A-Y\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n\n415\n00:21:11.577 --> 00:21:12.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n416\n00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.974\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n417\n00:21:13.974 --> 00:21:15.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's enough.\n\n418\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:18.033\n[CROSSTALK] Let me not go too far, yeah.\n\n419\n00:21:18.033 --> 00:21:21.248\nYeah, let me cuz apparently yeah,\nit might have gotten kicked off, or\n\n420\n00:21:21.248 --> 00:21:22.220\nsomething problem.\n\n421\n00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.124\nSo, of course notice that you can of\ncourse change your membership, whether you\n\n422\n00:21:27.124 --> 00:21:30.344\nwant them to become owner so that they\ncan add in other people, as well.\n\n423\n00:21:30.344 --> 00:21:32.703\nBut let's just go ahead and\nmake those both members, and\n\n424\n00:21:32.703 --> 00:21:34.350\nthen of course we have Joey.\n\n425\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:39.390\nAdding that in, and\nthen I will close that team.\n\n426\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:47.330\nAnd now I have the Edutainers team and\nlook, I can add more people.\n\n427\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.525\nI can create more channels.\n\n428\n00:21:49.525 --> 00:21:53.410\nIs it starting to sound familiar to\nsomething that you and I have seen before?\n\n429\n00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.515\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] I'm sorry.\n\n430\n00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:57.253\n&gt;&gt; Had a little something in my throat.\n\n431\n00:21:57.253 --> 00:21:58.083\n&gt;&gt; Bless you!\n\n432\n00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:01.415\nI'm a little down in the weather.\n\n433\n00:22:01.415 --> 00:22:05.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nthis is where you'll start seeing that.\n\n434\n00:22:05.435 --> 00:22:06.023\nThere it is.\nAnd\n\n435\n00:22:06.023 --> 00:22:07.705\nthen down here at the bottom of course,\n\n436\n00:22:07.705 --> 00:22:10.950\nyou'll start seeing how you can\ncommunicate with the entire edutainers.\n\n437\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:16.227\nIf you see this where it says,\nstart a new conversation, all right?\n\n438\n00:22:16.227 --> 00:22:21.003\nUse @ to mention someone, hmm!\n\n439\n00:22:21.003 --> 00:22:25.532\nPlus, you're good [LAUGH] so here you go.\n\n440\n00:22:25.532 --> 00:22:26.373\n&gt;&gt; They're getting me today.\n\n441\n00:22:26.373 --> 00:22:30.933\n&gt;&gt; So you are starting to see where it\nis actually easily, it is essentially\n\n442\n00:22:30.933 --> 00:22:35.214\nturning into some of those other\nones that we're actually seeing.\n\n443\n00:22:35.214 --> 00:22:38.500\nAnd that's because I think that that's\nbecome a general kind of ad hoc standard.\n\n444\n00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.110\n&gt;&gt; Like a model, yeah.\n\n445\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.100\n&gt;&gt; Where it's like, everybody's really\nturning to this, they really like it,\n\n446\n00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.360\nit's super intuitive.\n\n447\n00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.500\nIt's easy to use, why not?\n\n448\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:52.450\nLet's create our own kind of a team here\nto allow something like this to happen.\n\n449\n00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.740\nSo creating a team is\nnot exactly difficult.\n\n450\n00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.420\nThen I can of course manage a team,\nI can add a channel,\n\n451\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:04.230\nadd members, I can leave the team,\nedit the team, get a link to the team.\n\n452\n00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.700\nYou name it, all of those are very\npossible in some of the things that we\n\n453\n00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.880\nactually need to be able to to do.\n\n454\n00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.320\nSo as long as everybody actually can\ndo that, that is pretty much fine.\n\n455\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.360\nNow there is only one other\nkind of prerequisite, here.\n\n456\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.730\nBy default, anybody inside of your\ntenancy, in other words share the domain\n\n457\n00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:27.980\nname that you're doing this with, they\nusually have a right to create a team.\n\n458\n00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.790\nNow you can limit that somehow, okay?\n\n459\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:35.251\nSo there is an administrative side to\nthis but here is where the rub comes in,\n\n460\n00:23:35.251 --> 00:23:37.910\nbecause this is totally brand new, Daniel.\n\n461\n00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:38.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n462\n00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.310\n&gt;&gt; The administrative side is not yet\nfully baked in.\n\n463\n00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.914\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna say that you\n\n464\n00:23:42.914 --> 00:23:45.040\ncan't [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's not as robust as it might\n\n465\n00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.080\nbe one day.\n\n466\n00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's probably going to become\nrobust because they're starting to set up\n\n467\n00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.950\na course to PowerShell\nbackend to everything.\n\n468\n00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.950\nWhich means administrative task,\nmeans they're going to be managing more.\n\n469\n00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.300\nAnd we're going to actually need\nto see something like this,\n\n470\n00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.570\nat least a little bit of it, to help us to\ncontrol some of the things we need to do.\n\n471\n00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:07.100\nBut this advantage, even though we're\nreally just talking about the idea here,\n\n472\n00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:12.830\nof adding in just a group,\nor the team here.\n\n473\n00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:17.020\nWell, that's a part of, being on a chat\nis a big part of it as well, but\n\n474\n00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.470\nwe also have to have the ability\nlike we do in other products to say,\n\n475\n00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.970\nhey this needs to integrate\nin with something else.\n\n476\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.570\nSo let's take for an example here, that I\nhave files that are stored in OneDrive.\n\n477\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:32.840\nWell I wanna be able to retrieve files and\nshare them with the group as well,\n\n478\n00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.910\nand that means I have to\nactually integrate that in.\n\n479\n00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.890\nAnd that's something we used\ncalled connectors, too.\n\n480\n00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:41.840\nSo we also need to actually take a look\nat how we do something like that.\n\n481\n00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.070\nTo actually allow for the connectors to be\nput in place and get that up and running.\n\n482\n00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.650\nBut then we also want to take\na look of course at some,\n\n483\n00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.760\nat least briefly, at where PowerShell\nhas taken us for Microsoft teams.\n\n484\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.670\nSo we're gonna show you that as well, but\nwe actually have to save that for a second\n\n485\n00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.530\nepisode because I'm running out of time\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n486\n00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:01.340\n&gt;&gt; For this episode.\n\n487\n00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.430\nIf I continue on,\nthis is gonna be the longest episode ever.\n\n488\n00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:05.630\nI'm not gonna do that.\n\n489\n00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:09.550\nSo Daniel, this is a great place for us to\nkinda pick up on the other side of this.\n\n490\n00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.530\nSo now that we've created our first group\nhere, of course that means now everybody\n\n491\n00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.640\nthat is actually part of that group can\ncommunicate in that particular team and\n\n492\n00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.000\nthen you're off and ready to go.\n\n493\n00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.260\nBut we still want to see some of\nthe PowerShell side of things and\n\n494\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.990\nwe also want to see just a little bit\nmore on that idea of implementing,\n\n495\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.220\nwhich I can't say, connectors.\n\n496\n00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.630\nWith Microsoft teams, as well.\n\n497\n00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, sounds great, Ronnie, looking\nforward to seeing how we work that out.\n\n498\n00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.866\nBecause it's just a day without sunshine\nif we don't throw some PowerShell or\n\n499\n00:25:35.866 --> 00:25:37.935\nsomething like some Microsoft product.\n\n500\n00:25:37.935 --> 00:25:39.460\nBut join us back for that.\n\n501\n00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.410\nAs for this episode, as Ronnie has said,\nwe are a bit out of time, so\n\n502\n00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.500\nwe're gonna call it a day.\n\n503\n00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.370\nThanks for watching, everone.\n\n504\n00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.130\nSignnig off for

another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.330\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.240\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\nwith more in our Enabling Office 365\n\n8\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.610\nServices series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.450\nJoining us back in the studio, well you'll\nnever guess who I found roaming the halls,\n\n10\n00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.500\nwondering what his name was,\nand babbling incoherently.\n\n11\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.118\nBut he knows a lot about enabling\nOffice 365 services, our good friend,\n\n12\n00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:33.680\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.520\nRonnie, welcome back, man.\n\n14\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.298\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n15\n00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:35.798\nis going great.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] your name.\n\n16\n00:00:35.798 --> 00:00:38.338\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well thank you very much.\n\n17\n00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.400\nYes, thank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue to take a look at,\n\n18\n00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.220\nof course the 70-347 exam and\nsome of the content that we still need to\n\n19\n00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.150\ncover if you're just picking up\nright here for whatever reason.\n\n20\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.038\nYou just said,\nI'm just gonna pick a random episode and\n\n21\n00:00:54.038 --> 00:00:57.847\nyou landed on this one because the name\nwas interesting, Configuring and\n\n22\n00:00:57.847 --> 00:01:00.129\nManaging StaffHub, Microsoft StaffHub.\n\n23\n00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.040\nAnd you're probably like,\nwhat the heck is StaffHub?\n\n24\n00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.520\nWe're gonna hopefully answer that.\n\n25\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.580\nAnd then of course you actually have\nto kind of see some of the things that\n\n26\n00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.590\nyou can do with it.\n\n27\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.980\nAnd then put it into context that you'll\nactually be working with it, as well.\n\n28\n00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.730\nSo because of the update to the exam,\n\n29\n00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.500\nthey added in an entire domain\nobjective into the exam.\n\n30\n00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.820\nSo it's not just one topic,\n\n31\n00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.000\nright, now there's a whole bunch of\nstuff that we just decided to add in.\n\n32\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.620\nWe've decided also of course\nin this series to go back and\n\n33\n00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.090\nadd that information in as well so that\nyou have the latest material that you need\n\n34\n00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.915\nto make sure that you are ready for\nthe exam, okay.\n\n35\n00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:34.235\nSo that brings us back to that question,\n\n36\n00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:39.735\nthe idea here of what is\nMicrosoft StaffHub, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:43.825\nSo this was actually very interesting\nbecause I kind of saw it the first time is\n\n38\n00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:48.075\nI started I didn't really ever pay\nattention to it in Office 365.\n\n39\n00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:50.345\nAnd there's a good reason for it, Daniel.\n\n40\n00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:52.761\nOkay, there really is,\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n41\n00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:55.490\nLet's take a look at my computer and\nthis will help us out.\n\n42\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.750\nSo Daniel, as you see before us,\n\n43\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.800\nwe're on the portal.office.com.\n&gt;&gt; We are there.\n\n44\n00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.420\n&gt;&gt; It's Office 365,\n\n45\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.370\nis exactly what I think that\nyou would actually think about.\n\n46\n00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.000\nAnd so if you're looking for, of course,\na service, it's probably these apps that\n\n47\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.740\nwe're generally thinking about\nthe majority of the time, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.500\nAnd there is one conspicuous absence,\nsince we're actually talking about\n\n49\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.020\nthe topic, which is-\n\n50\n00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.990\n&gt;&gt; StaffHub.\n&gt;&gt; StaffHub.\n\n51\n00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.330\n&gt;&gt; Does not exist in this Dojo.\n\n52\n00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.850\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't seem to actually be inside\n\n53\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.740\nof Office 365, and yet\nit's part of the Enabling Services show.\n\n54\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.470\nSo what is this about?\n\n55\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.120\nYeah, that's a great question.\n\n56\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.790\nI don't know why they decided not\nto actually include it in there,\n\n57\n00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.620\nexcept that it's really for\nkind of a subset of users, or\n\n58\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.220\neven a subset of\nan industry if you want to.\n\n59\n00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.096\nThat tends to be the reason why\nStaffHub is actually out there in\n\n60\n00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.037\nthe world today, okay.\n\n61\n00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:55.899\nSo when you start to take a look, it's not\nreally inside of the portal.office.com,\n\n62\n00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.480\nso you're not gonna find a link for it.\n\n63\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.180\nYou're not going to find any of that.\n\n64\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.690\nBut at the same time it does\nrely on the infrastructure\n\n65\n00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.400\nof Office 365 to carry out a lot\nof the things it can do, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.470\nNow if you want to know more about\nStaffHub, well now if I click on\n\n67\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.810\nanother tab here, okay, and\nyou go to staffhub.office.com.\n\n68\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.080\nNotice it actually has its own.\n\n69\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.000\nSo not portal.office.com, but StaffHub.\n&gt;&gt; It's its own entity,\n\n70\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.010\nreally.\n&gt;&gt; It is its\n\n71\n00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.640\nown entity.\n\n72\n00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.480\n&gt;&gt; So important.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n73\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.960\nIt's off by itself.\n\n74\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.194\nAnd this is where we start seeing kind\nof Microsoft terminology kind of trying\n\n75\n00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:38.610\nto make it something in which you're like,\nwow, that's impressive.\n\n76\n00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.603\nBut the key word, let me see if\nI can zoom in without causing\n\n77\n00:03:41.603 --> 00:03:42.754\na stroke here-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n78\n00:03:42.754 --> 00:03:44.107\n&gt;&gt; For a moment, well maybe I can,\n\n79\n00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:45.370\nmaybe I'm already doing it.\n\n80\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.090\nLet me see,\nI'll zoom in just a little bit more.\n\n81\n00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.050\nIt has to do with, of course.\n&gt;&gt; Does this control plus and\n\n82\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.460\nminus work for Edge?\n&gt;&gt; No, apparently it doesn't.\n\n83\n00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.220\nSo there we go, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's special of\n\n84\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.720\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, isn't that great.\n\n85\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.650\nI was hoping to do that, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Why would we do something every other\n\n86\n00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.300\nbrowser does?\n&gt;&gt; Let me just put it back here.\n\n87\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.590\nIt's right here under these\nwords where my cursor is going.\n\n88\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.670\nI was hoping to zoom in so\nthat you could see it.\n\n89\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.400\nFor firstline workforce.\n&gt;&gt; Firstline workforce.\n\n90\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.251\n&gt;&gt; Now, Daniel, you and\n\n91\n00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.280\nI have worked a lot of different job.\n\n92\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.120\nWe've been in construction,\nwe've done other things.\n\n93\n00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.600\nWe've been in IT world.\n\n94\n00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.607\nDaniel, when have you heard firstline\n\n95\n00:04:22.607 --> 00:04:24.075\nworkforce?\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n96\n00:04:24.075 --> 00:04:24.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Never.\n\n97\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.654\n&gt;&gt; Never,\n\n98\n00:04:25.654 --> 00:04:28.329\nthis is a Microsoft-ism.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n99\n00:04:28.329 --> 00:04:30.950\nit's something in which you're like, what?\n\n100\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.060\nWhat does that actually mean?\n\n101\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.120\nWhen it comes down to it, what they're\nreally referring to is really that\n\n102\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.980\nfirst person that you generally encounter\nwith a business a lot of times.\n\n103\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.500\nNow if you're actually in one\nof those business like ITProTV-\n\n104\n00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.620\n&gt;&gt; It's like customer service stuff?\n\n105\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.640\n&gt;&gt; You would think,\n\n106\n00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.790\ncustomer service, okay, but\nit really even goes more basic than that.\n\n107\n00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.130\nYou go to a restaurant, whose normally\nthe first person, like a host,\n\n108\n00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.150\nright, or somebody that seats you, or a\nwaitress, wait staff, somebody like that.\n\n109\n00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.118\nThat's what they're referring to, okay.\n\n110\n00:04:59.118 --> 00:05:04.410\nThis is really the idea of some scheduling\nsoftware that is really designed for us.\n\n111\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.240\nNow why is this different?\n\n112\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.882\nWhy don't we just use email or use some\ntype of scheduling thing inside of Office?\n\n113\n00:05:10.882 --> 00:05:11.683\n&gt;&gt; Like a calendar.\n\n114\n00:05:11.683 --> 00:05:12.663\n&gt;&gt; Like a calendar, yeah,\n\n115\n00:05:12.663 --> 00:05:14.250\njust an outright calendar.\n\n116\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.470\nWell these are different kind\nof scenarios here, right.\n\n117\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.910\nIf we're going to office.com and\nwe're using a calendar inside of Outlook,\n\n118\n00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.010\nit's normally because somebody\nis going to sit down at a desk.\n\n119\n00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.270\nThey're going to pull\nup their email client,\n\n120\n00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.556\nthey're going to pull up outlook.com, and\nthen pull up their calendar and it's nice.\n\n121\n00:05:31.556 --> 00:05:34.653\nLook I got all these schedules and\nall these meetings going on.\n\n122\n00:05:34.653 --> 00:05:39.213\nBut most of the people that do the\nfirstline workforce, right, waitstaff or\n\n123\n00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:42.950\nhotel staff or somebody that's\ncoming in to work on schedule.\n\n124\n00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.451\n&gt;&gt; Like a traditional desktop environment,\n\n125\n00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:46.251\nwhere we go point of sale,\nor something like that.\n\n126\n00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:48.457\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's really not a desk for\n\n127\n00:05:48.457 --> 00:05:52.480\nthem to sit down and\nlet me check my schedule in that way.\n\n128\n00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.310\nWell StaffHub is really designed\naround that concept and that idea,\n\n129\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.540\nthat you may have, of course,\nthat first-line workforce\n\n130\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.670\nthat doesn't have that traditional\noffice type of environment.\n\n131\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.720\nAnd so you still need to make sure\nthat scheduling goes out, and\n\n132\n00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.900\nthey need to have communication\nthat needs to be done.\n\n133\n00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.120\nYou need to be able, of course,\nto send communication.\n\n134\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.170\nYou need to get maybe some feedback\nfrom your employees that might\n\n135\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.280\nrequest a day off or they're sick or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n136\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.100\nBut you need all that,\nyou need to be able to schedule that, and\n\n137\n00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.710\nall that information needs to go out.\n\n138\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.855\nYou might even be able to,\nwith something like StaffHub,\n\n139\n00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:35.090\ngo, right,\nhere's what needs to happen with this.\n\n140\n00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.819\nThe employee handbook, we're gonna make\nsure it goes out but it's in a PDF.\n\n141\n00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:41.560\nI don't have a computer\nthat I print that off on.\n\n142\n00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.190\nNo big deal,\nyou can actually use StaffHub, and\n\n143\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.730\nthe reason why is StaffHub is\nreally designed in the fashion\n\n144\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.700\nto actually be more of an app on something\nsuch as a small hand held device.\n\n145\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.580\nSo the neat thing about it, right,\n\n146\n00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.400\nin terms of what StaffHub does,\nokay, is that it can all be done.\n\n147\n00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.863\nWhether your actually\nthe firstline workforce and\n\n148\n00:07:02.863 --> 00:07:08.550\nyou're getting schedules on your hand held\ndevice or you're requesting time off or\n\n149\n00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.910\nyou're putting in a sick day or whatever\nit might be, requesting a schedule change.\n\n150\n00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.300\nLooking at emails and stuff like that,\nwhich is perfectly fine, but\n\n151\n00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.900\nalso is the same way for\nthat administrator too.\n\n152\n00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.740\nThey don't have to go and find a PC.\n\n153\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.340\nThey can all do it from that interface\nwhich is that handheld device as well.\n\n154\n00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.271\nSo that's why they call it this idea\nfirstline workforce, welcome to\n\n155\n00:07:30.271 --> 00:07:36.010\nthe go-to-tool for everything work, okay,\nis what they're actually talk about.\n\n156\n00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.122\nSo in this way it is, it's really the idea\nof actually having a mobile app that\n\n157\n00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:44.235\nallows you to manage, okay, things\nlike schedules, communicate with your\n\n158\n00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:48.315\nemployees, and have them also communicate\nback with you, okay, as well.\n\n159\n00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:51.434\nAnd making sure that everybody can\nget the information that they need.\n\n160\n00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:53.293\nSo this is why this is\na little bit more unusual.\n\n161\n00:07:53.293 --> 00:07:57.778\nCuz all of us when we think about the idea\nof Office 365, we think of an office and\n\n162\n00:07:57.778 --> 00:07:59.996\nthat's where people are going to work.\n\n163\n00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:04.429\nBut Microsoft is venturing out into\nthe smaller subset of saying, look,\n\n164\n00:08:04.429 --> 00:08:09.150\nwe know that there's a whole group of\nessentially service employees out there\n\n165\n00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.520\nthat probably are not gonna\nsit at a desk anymore.\n\n166\n00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.670\nBut we really want their money.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.282\n&gt;&gt; What it comes to.\n\n168\n00:08:16.282 --> 00:08:16.792\nI'm joking.\n\n169\n00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:18.577\nThey wanna provide a service,\nis that right?\n\n170\n00:08:18.577 --> 00:08:20.823\nThat is comprehensive-\n&gt;&gt; And they want the money.\n\n171\n00:08:20.823 --> 00:08:21.792\n&gt;&gt; And they want the money,\n\n172\n00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:22.470\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n173\n00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.920\n&gt;&gt; What it comes down to.\n\n174\n00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.820\nSo yeah,\nthere's a bit of this that goes on.\n\n175\n00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.790\nSo why is it also in Office 365?\n\n176\n00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.528\nBecause, well you have to have-\n&gt;&gt; Gotta put it somewhere.\n\n177\n00:08:33.528 --> 00:08:34.896\n&gt;&gt; You have to have an Office 365\n\n178\n00:08:34.896 --> 00:08:35.610\nsubscription.\n\n179\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.200\nSo all of the sudden it's like,\nwhoa, wait a minute.\n\n180\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.270\nThis is gonna start\ncosting some additional.\n\n181\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.785\nSo if I don't have a worker, Daniel,\nthat actually sits down at a computer,\n\n182\n00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:48.700\nwell why am I going to buy them\nan Office 365 subscription so\n\n183\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.980\nthat they can get access\nto all of this stuff?\n\n184\n00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.860\nIt seems insane.\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n185\n00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:57.560\nAnd I only assume that this is something\nthat's relatively new to Microsoft and\n\n186\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.690\nthey're probably just bundling\nwith the existing infrastructure.\n\n187\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.920\nAnd if it becomes popular,\nI can see it migrating over to its\n\n188\n00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.140\nown entity.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do make it where if you\n\n189\n00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:13.450\nalready have your Office 365 account,\nwhatever level that you're at, usually E1,\n\n190\n00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.480\nE3, E5, all those that you sometimes see,\nyou can get access to StaffHub.\n\n191\n00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.520\nBut what about for the, let's say, 10 or\n\n192\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.320\n15 of your service staff that you\nhave that doesn't have a desk?\n\n193\n00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.310\nI don't want to pay the extra eight\nbucks or 12 bucks a month for\n\n194\n00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.180\nthat cuz they don't even have a desk.\n\n195\n00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.490\nWhat am I going to do,\nwhy is that even beneficial?\n\n196\n00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.560\nWell, what they're saying is,\n\n197\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:41.390\nlook, we can actually reduce that\ndown to look at this, that's right.\n\n198\n00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.190\nSo instead of the low\ncost of $8 a month here,\n\n199\n00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.880\nwe'll slash it in half,\nis what they're doing.\n\n200\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.580\nSo they're saying,\n\n201\n00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.250\nwe're not gonna take the whole pie cuz\nwe're not really giving you the whole pie.\n\n202\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.330\nThey're just taking a slice.\n\n203\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.970\nJust wetting the beak a little bit,\nas The Godfather movies would say,\n\n204\n00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.990\nis what you would actually see there.\n\n205\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.140\nSo maximizing the impact of\nyour first line workforce for\n\n206\n00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.120\nabout $4 a month on the annual commitment.\n\n207\n00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.240\nIn other words,\nabout $48 a year per employee.\n\n208\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.930\nNow that's actually not bad.\n\n209\n00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:14.830\nIt can integrate in with other\ndatabase systems that are already out\n\n210\n00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.818\nthere if you need to, if you can kind of\nfigure out how all that ends up working.\n\n211\n00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:19.720\nBut you can kinda see that,\n\n212\n00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.230\nthis one okay, every employee\nthat's gonna end up using Staffhub\n\n213\n00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.210\nis essentially going to have to have\none of these, is what they're gonna do.\n\n214\n00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.650\nSo it doesn't really give\nthem access to Office itself.\n\n215\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.790\nBut, if you want to come here,\nyou'll actually see all I did before\n\n216\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.530\ngetting this link is I went to a search\nengine and I just typed in Office 365 F1.\n\n217\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.282\nNow, there is an older SKU number, or\n\n218\n00:10:43.282 --> 00:10:48.541\nan older program number that you may\nalso see, or subscription number.\n\n219\n00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:54.410\nIf you see the term K1, which is\nthe older one, it's the same as F1.\n\n220\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.750\nAnd I'm mentioning this just for\n\n221\n00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.338\nthe purpose of the exam\nmore than anything else.\n\n222\n00:10:58.338 --> 00:11:03.300\nThe older K1, when they were\nactually renumbering things, somehow\n\n223\n00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.560\nthose particular accounts that they were\nusing StaffHub at the very beginning when\n\n224\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.040\nit was first starting, they may still be\non that license for one reason or another.\n\n225\n00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.020\nBut newer ones may show up as F1 instead.\n\n226\n00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.510\nThey are exactly identical is\nwhat they're actually doing.\n\n227\n00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.680\nBut this license allows the schedule and\n\n228\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.720\ntask management, communications,\ngives you the ability,\n\n229\n00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.400\nof course, make sure that they go through\nall of the onboarding process they need.\n\n230\n00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.640\nYou can even share onboarding videos,\nDaniel,\n\n231\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.660\nif you want to.\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n232\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.880\n&gt;&gt; Right there, so I remember working at\n\n233\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.800\na fast food restaurant, right?\n&gt;&gt; You poor man [CROSSTALK].\n\n234\n00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.575\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n235\n00:11:37.575 --> 00:11:39.790\nwhen I was in college it was like,\nI gotta get a job.\n\n236\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:44.920\nAnd I sat literally in this linen closet,\nwith a little TV like this and a big\n\n237\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.870\ngigantic VCR and had to watch like ten\nof these tapes that went through there.\n\n238\n00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.370\nAnd the monitor was,\nit was like eight inches.\n\n239\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.680\nAnd there I am, I'm six,\neight inches from the screen.\n\n240\n00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.400\nI can't believe I'm\ndoing all this just for\n\n241\n00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.250\na job.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n242\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.900\n&gt;&gt; But now you can actually take it with\n\n243\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.005\nyou and you have all that too.\n\n244\n00:12:02.005 --> 00:12:04.310\nOf course, identity and access manager.\n\n245\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:08.860\nSo it includes the ability,\nof course, of the workday management.\n\n246\n00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.820\nAnd that's really about the idea\nof scheduling here, email, and\n\n247\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.520\ncalendars, because that's how\nthe communication process works.\n\n248\n00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.611\nSo if you don't have email, you're not\ngoing to be able to actually use StaffHub\n\n249\n00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:20.800\nso they create you with an email account.\n\n250\n00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.520\nMessaging, so that you of course,\ncan communicate.\n\n251\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.350\nNow this is actually something that\nthey really do push hard here.\n\n252\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.980\nThe very fact of using instant\nmessages is really key.\n\n253\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.960\nSo one of the examples,\n\n254\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.690\nif you go through the StaffHub type\nthings that they talk about here.\n\n255\n00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:40.110\nIs that it may be where, Daniel,\nyou're managing this restaurant and\n\n256\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.410\nall your employees out there, and you\nknow that every one of them has StaffHub.\n\n257\n00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.110\nAnd now your supervisor, or\nthe owner, comes into the restaurant.\n\n258\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.920\nYou can immediately send every employee\na message like, hey, owner's coming in,\n\n259\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.770\n1 PM, make sure everything's done.\n\n260\n00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.950\nAnd it just goes, so there's no\ndoubt about it that it's actually\n\n261\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.020\ngoing to go out to every single employee.\n\n262\n00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.870\nAnd then you can actually verify whether\nor not they've actually seen that message.\n\n263\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.270\nAnd that way they know,\nthey can't say, I didn't know.\n\n264\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.680\nAnd that's why they're there,\nso it can do all that.\n\n265\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.020\nTeamwork, file and\nstorage, and the file and\n\n266\n00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.367\nstorage is actually interesting because\nit allows them for one reason or\n\n267\n00:13:14.367 --> 00:13:19.140\nanother to have two gigs of personal\ncloud storage, well, sure why not?\n\n268\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.090\nI don't know what else I would be\nstoring up there, but you can do that.\n\n269\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.196\nAnd then social networking\nif they need to.\n\n270\n00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:28.684\nOf course, access to Office Online,\n\n271\n00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:32.420\nProfessional Digital Storytelling,\nyou name it.\n\n272\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.834\nIt actually is a pretty good size account,\nso it doesn't look like it's leaving off\n\n273\n00:13:36.834 --> 00:13:41.458\nanything except for Office itself in terms\nof Office 2016 as you're doing things.\n\n274\n00:13:41.458 --> 00:13:46.740\nSo it actually does give you quite a bit,\nas well as all the other details here.\n\n275\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.340\nMake sure you check out this link.\n\n276\n00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.930\nI'll go back and\nI'll add this link into the notes so\n\n277\n00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.750\nthat you can just go, all right,\nlet me check that out.\n\n278\n00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.180\nIt's got a great deal of information\non this particular type of account.\n\n279\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.750\nThis is the one you'll need if your\nemployees do not currently have\n\n280\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.880\nan existing Office 365 subscription.\n\n281\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.316\nSo once you have that and\nyou now have decided, hey here it is,\n\n282\n00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:11.540\nwe are going to go to StaffHub.\n\n283\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.583\nThere's two different places that you'll\nneed to actually pick up here and\n\n284\n00:14:16.583 --> 00:14:17.621\nbe able to see.\n\n285\n00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:22.466\nIf I am just managing StaffHub, in other\nwords, it's already been set up and\n\n286\n00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:25.979\nI'm managing it,\nthere's a couple of things I can do.\n\n287\n00:14:25.979 --> 00:14:29.683\nI can just click on Sign in from\nthe staffhub.office.com, and\n\n288\n00:14:29.683 --> 00:14:33.398\nfrom there I'll click on Joey,\nwho I'm impersonating today.\n\n289\n00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:38.847\nAnd just a moment,\nit should actually pop up here.\n\n290\n00:14:41.471 --> 00:14:43.850\nAnd now you can end up\nseeing that right away,\n\n291\n00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.918\nit's showing you this kind of schedule\nin what you might actually go ahead and\n\n292\n00:14:47.918 --> 00:14:50.064\nstart doing.\n&gt;&gt; So it really reminds me of,\n\n293\n00:14:50.064 --> 00:14:51.640\nI worked at a grocery store-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n294\n00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.970\n&gt;&gt; as a young man and\n\n295\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.570\nthey would post a schedule,\na written schedule on the board.\n\n296\n00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.930\nSo you know when you're\nsupposed to come in,\n\n297\n00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.300\nknow what times you're\nsupposed to be there, and\n\n298\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.360\nall of the hours you were gonna work for\nthe week.\n\n299\n00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.420\nThis is what that reminds me of.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it's doing,\n\n300\n00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.290\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n301\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.070\n&gt;&gt; But then,\n\n302\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.960\ninstead of going I can't work that day,\nemployees can just submit their request\n\n303\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.480\nthrough this and\nthen it's actually in one system.\n\n304\n00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.100\nSo, every employee gets access to it.\n\n305\n00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.190\nThey can do essentially the same thing.\n\n306\n00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.320\nSo right here you'll see Joey,\nI went ahead and just added in one so\n\n307\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.680\nthat you can see that.\n\n308\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.980\nNow, you can even add in groups\nof users if you wanted to.\n\n309\n00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.230\nSo if you go there's busboys,\nor there's wait staff, or\n\n310\n00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.050\nthere's hosts.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n311\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.920\n&gt;&gt; If you're in the hotel industry,\n\n312\n00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.570\nthere's the service desks, you know.\n&gt;&gt; Bell hops, whatever.\n\n313\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.531\n&gt;&gt; Bell hops, yeah, yeah,\n\n314\n00:15:35.531 --> 00:15:38.601\nlike you said in the grocery store, all\nthe different ones, cashiers [CROSSTALK].\n\n315\n00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:39.483\n&gt;&gt; Baggers.\n\n316\n00:15:39.483 --> 00:15:40.460\n&gt;&gt; Baggers.\n\n317\n00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.640\n&gt;&gt; Or stockboys.\n\n318\n00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.920\n&gt;&gt; You can actually create groups and\n\n319\n00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.840\nadd those in too and get all that done.\n\n320\n00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:52.171\nSo in this example, If I wanted to I could\nactually say managers for this point here.\n\n321\n00:15:52.171 --> 00:15:55.555\nAnd let's just say managers,\nand I could put Joey on and\n\n322\n00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:58.291\nthen if I wanted to create a schedule for\nhim,\n\n323\n00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:02.397\nNotice I just simply clicked in this\nbox and it gave me a drop-down.\n\n324\n00:16:02.397 --> 00:16:06.590\nAnd from down here, let me see again,\nif I can zoom in a little bit.\n\n325\n00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.918\nThere we go.\n\n326\n00:16:07.918 --> 00:16:10.217\nToo much.\n\n327\n00:16:10.217 --> 00:16:12.229\nI can't zoom in too, there we go.\n\n328\n00:16:12.229 --> 00:16:14.610\nSo it's 8 to 5 at this point.\n\n329\n00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:18.068\nI can go ahead and give him that,\nand notice I don't have a break.\n\n330\n00:16:18.068 --> 00:16:21.676\nIt even keeps track of breaks everything\nthat you actually think about.\n\n331\n00:16:21.676 --> 00:16:25.255\nSo you can do that or you can add\nan additional shift, if you want to.\n\n332\n00:16:25.255 --> 00:16:28.616\nIf I select any one like that,\nthere's 8 to 5.\n\n333\n00:16:28.616 --> 00:16:35.010\nAnd now,\nI can also add in there to add the shift.\n\n334\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.888\nIf I want to say, given or break,\n\n335\n00:16:36.888 --> 00:16:39.783\na notice even makes up here\nthen if you can see that.\n\n336\n00:16:39.783 --> 00:16:41.460\nIt said, unpaid breaks.\n\n337\n00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.888\nYeah, it said unpaid breaks.\n\n338\n00:16:42.888 --> 00:16:46.178\nAnd now it's gonna make me refresh,\ncuz it's saying, I did something silly.\n\n339\n00:16:46.178 --> 00:16:47.104\nBroke it.\nI broke it.\n\n340\n00:16:47.104 --> 00:16:52.393\n[LAUGH] That's what happens when I\ntry to zoom in a little bit with my,\n\n341\n00:16:52.393 --> 00:16:53.886\nthe unpaid breaks.\n\n342\n00:16:53.886 --> 00:16:56.216\nSo it even keeps track of everything.\n\n343\n00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:59.250\nSo if you wanted to,\nyou can actually do that and imagine that.\n\n344\n00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.843\nYou're not having to color\nin that little sheet and\n\n345\n00:17:01.843 --> 00:17:03.600\nmake sure everybody can see that.\n\n346\n00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.042\nBut no, no,\ndon't pour something on it by accident.\n\n347\n00:17:06.042 --> 00:17:06.565\nIt's all right here.\nYeah.\n\n348\n00:17:06.565 --> 00:17:09.310\nAnd they all check it,\nessentially through their phones.\n\n349\n00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.183\nSo that's the same thing\nthat can be done right here.\n\n350\n00:17:13.183 --> 00:17:18.789\nIf I needed to add in a member, so\nlet's do your idea with the grocery story.\n\n351\n00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:19.942\nYeah.\nCuz I didn't mention that.\n\n352\n00:17:19.942 --> 00:17:21.287\nSo let's say, stock.\n\n353\n00:17:24.396 --> 00:17:28.006\nStockers not stock, stalking.\n\n354\n00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:29.470\nNot stalkers.\n\n355\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.717\nStalkers.\n\n356\n00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:33.305\nWe're going to stalk you.\n\n357\n00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:34.778\n[LAUGH] Put you on a shelf.\n\n358\n00:17:34.778 --> 00:17:37.860\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nit's really not helping the analogy.\n\n359\n00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.825\nI know, yeah, it really isn't.\n\n360\n00:17:38.825 --> 00:17:41.000\nEither way it's kind of creepy.\n\n361\n00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.023\nIt sounds bad.\n\n362\n00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:46.615\n[LAUGH] So I know that there's Lance and\nthen I can do Lance Bass.\n\n363\n00:17:46.615 --> 00:17:48.080\nThere it goes.\n\n364\n00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.538\nSo notice if he's already existing in the\nOffice 365 infrastructure, it'll find him.\n\n365\n00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:54.360\nIf not, it can go ahead.\n\n366\n00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.049\nOnce you have that account,\nit'll create it as well.\n\n367\n00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:59.296\nSo you can do that and\nthen add in a phone number.\n\n368\n00:17:59.296 --> 00:18:02.936\nSo that's important, because it's gonna\nbe part of that mobile device, so\n\n369\n00:18:02.936 --> 00:18:05.510\nthat messages can be\nsent when they need to.\n\n370\n00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.639\nAnd the other thing,\n\n371\n00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:10.164\nof course is enter phone number to\nsend an invite to join StaffHub.\n\n372\n00:18:10.164 --> 00:18:13.529\nSo this, way even if the employee isn't or\nthey're brand new.\n\n373\n00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:15.158\nAnd go hey, we need to enter you in.\n\n374\n00:18:15.158 --> 00:18:16.981\nBut this is how we keep\ntrack of everybody,\n\n375\n00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:18.559\nhow you'll find your schedule out.\n\n376\n00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:19.838\nWe simply add that in there.\n\n377\n00:18:19.838 --> 00:18:22.068\nThey'll be able to join doing that.\n\n378\n00:18:22.068 --> 00:18:23.880\nThey'll download the app to their phone.\n\n379\n00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.339\nThey'll be given their account and\nthen they are off, and\n\n380\n00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:29.536\nready to go once everything is done.\n\n381\n00:18:29.536 --> 00:18:32.460\nSo that's how you actually add in that,\nas well.\n\n382\n00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.627\nI'm must gonna click add here.\n\n383\n00:18:34.627 --> 00:18:37.740\nAnd now,\nnotice I actually added in Lance Bass.\n\n384\n00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.088\nNow you'll see that there's a difference\nbetween Joey's account and Lance's,\n\n385\n00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:42.592\nas well.\n\n386\n00:18:42.592 --> 00:18:46.191\nAnd notice that there's that kind of\nlittle phone that they're showing\n\n387\n00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:46.845\nright here.\n\n388\n00:18:46.845 --> 00:18:51.190\nAnd if I now click on that drop-down,\nI can send the invite.\n\n389\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.904\nI can move the team member and\nthat doesn't make much sense.\n\n390\n00:18:53.904 --> 00:18:57.863\nLet me add in somebody else here and\nthat other one was JT,\n\n391\n00:18:57.863 --> 00:19:00.350\nwhich is Justine Timberlake here.\n\n392\n00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.163\nSo let's say that you had this and\nthen you needed to switch or\n\n393\n00:19:06.163 --> 00:19:09.617\nyou needed to do something,\nI can just click on the little phone.\n\n394\n00:19:09.617 --> 00:19:11.300\nI can move the team member.\n\n395\n00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.403\nAnd now it says,\npress your up or down arrow.\n\n396\n00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:16.026\nAnd notice you can actually\nmove those things up and\n\n397\n00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:19.198\ndown if you need to,\nto rearrange that schedule a little bit or\n\n398\n00:19:19.198 --> 00:19:22.250\nput them in the order that\nyou want them to be in.\n\n399\n00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.131\nIt goes ahead and\ntotals up your hours for you.\n\n400\n00:19:25.131 --> 00:19:29.010\nSo of course, that way,\nyou don't actually get over time or\n\n401\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.030\nanything like that that tends to go by.\n\n402\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.967\nAll of this is actually very possible.\n\n403\n00:19:33.967 --> 00:19:38.252\nIf you fill this out for the entire week,\nyou can copy your last schedule.\n\n404\n00:19:38.252 --> 00:19:41.306\nProbably move it forward to the next\nweek and just change the names or\n\n405\n00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.870\nchange the order, and you're ready to go.\n\n406\n00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.964\nAt the end of, before you do all\nthis as you are actually managing as\n\n407\n00:19:47.964 --> 00:19:50.320\nthe administrator or as the manager.\n\n408\n00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.873\nOnce you're done and\nyou think everything is good,\n\n409\n00:19:52.873 --> 00:19:56.945\nyou just simply publish it and then that\ngoes out, of course, to all of your users.\n\n410\n00:19:56.945 --> 00:20:00.589\nThroughout all the ones that\nactually have staff up there.\n\n411\n00:20:00.589 --> 00:20:05.695\nSo it's relatively easy to work with\nbe able to actually work with StaffHub.\n\n412\n00:20:05.695 --> 00:20:09.740\nNow, there are a few other things\nup here at the top as we also see.\n\n413\n00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.908\nSo schedule is probably the most important\none is that's what most people are trying\n\n414\n00:20:13.908 --> 00:20:16.857\nto do, especially at the first\nline worker instance here.\n\n415\n00:20:16.857 --> 00:20:20.110\nMaking sure everybody is actually on\nthe schedule and are they fitting in\n\n416\n00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.276\nwhere they need to, and do they have\na place to be able to request that.\n\n417\n00:20:23.276 --> 00:20:27.728\nYou, of course,\ncan also add in files, Team Files.\n\n418\n00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:30.447\nThis is good for employee handbooks or\nPDFs that you need.\n\n419\n00:20:30.447 --> 00:20:35.777\nThe idea of actually putting in those\non boarding documents that you want to,\n\n420\n00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:36.438\nas well.\n\n421\n00:20:36.438 --> 00:20:38.850\nLet me see if I can drag that\nover to the right-hand side.\n\n422\n00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.635\nI kinda zoomed in so\nthat we could see this too.\n\n423\n00:20:41.635 --> 00:20:43.466\nAnd that way, you can also add in a file.\n\n424\n00:20:43.466 --> 00:20:46.100\nYou drop it right there and\nthen team members can, of course,\n\n425\n00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.540\nget access to that.\n\n426\n00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:52.170\nYou, of course, can see the entire team\nand you see I've added these in before.\n\n427\n00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:56.664\nSo if they actually do have the correct\nstatus that they're on StaffHub,\n\n428\n00:20:56.664 --> 00:20:58.554\nyou'll see it says, active.\n\n429\n00:20:58.554 --> 00:21:01.040\nIf there are not, it should say, inactive.\n\n430\n00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.044\nAt this point, if all their doing is\npartly just getting those schedule,\n\n431\n00:21:05.044 --> 00:21:06.472\nread only is good enough.\n\n432\n00:21:06.472 --> 00:21:08.930\nThey're not gonna be\nchanging the schedule.\n\n433\n00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:14.239\nThey don't need to change the schedule,\nthen you can also just leave it at that.\n\n434\n00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:18.164\nNow if you select one of them,\nnotice that if I wanted to change one.\n\n435\n00:21:18.164 --> 00:21:21.110\nSo if somebody gets promoted,\nI can just click on it and\n\n436\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.700\nthen allow the team member to create or\nmodify a schedule.\n\n437\n00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.220\nYou simply just go ahead and\nmark that, and you save, and\n\n438\n00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.270\nyou send the invite, and\nthen they are off and ready to go.\n\n439\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:36.210\nSo it's very easy and you see,\nI didn't have to kinda go through like\n\n440\n00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.070\nyou got to go to the Admin Portal, then\nyou got to make sure that they are clicked\n\n441\n00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.610\non here and that they're part\nof this group and do all that.\n\n442\n00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.990\nYou just simply do it right here,\nit's off and easy to go here.\n\n443\n00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:51.330\nIf I select settings, this is a course,\nwhere you can create a little bit more and\n\n444\n00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.980\ncustomize information if you want to.\n\n445\n00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.536\nThat whatever your branch location or\ndepartment that you're actually doing,\n\n446\n00:21:59.536 --> 00:22:02.157\nhow long do you want\nthe schedule to go out for?\n\n447\n00:22:02.157 --> 00:22:04.050\nAnd of course, request.\n\n448\n00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.647\nThe manager requests employees\ncan send to their manager.\n\n449\n00:22:06.647 --> 00:22:10.496\nAdd custom reasons that can be used\nwhen assigning time off to employees.\n\n450\n00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:14.651\nChoose from when they\nsend time off requests.\n\n451\n00:22:14.651 --> 00:22:18.953\nAnd if I want the off,\nI can click there and change the icon.\n\n452\n00:22:18.953 --> 00:22:23.300\nSo then that way, they know exactly what\nthe difference is as they're requesting\n\n453\n00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.950\ndifferent time off,\ndepending on what you need.\n\n454\n00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.408\nAnd you can even add in\nmore custom options, so\n\n455\n00:22:29.408 --> 00:22:32.326\nthat you can build it out\na little bit more to your liking.\n\n456\n00:22:32.326 --> 00:22:35.052\nHere is a new one and\nyou'll notice- It says New.\n\n457\n00:22:35.052 --> 00:22:36.190\n[LAUGH] I think it's brand new.\n\n458\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.420\nIt says brand new.\n[LAUGH] Time tracking and reporting, yeah.\n\n459\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.388\nWhat ever gave you that idea, Ronnie?\n\n460\n00:22:39.388 --> 00:22:40.840\nYeah, where does that go?\n\n461\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.090\nSo this is actually relatively new and\nI say that.\n\n462\n00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:48.137\nIt's not, well,\nI'm pretty sure it's insanely new.\n\n463\n00:22:48.137 --> 00:22:50.910\nBecause I don't remember\nseeing it too often.\n\n464\n00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:52.480\nYesterday.\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know, yesterday.\n\n465\n00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.630\nIt was probably not too and\nI was like yeah, that's the new feature.\n\n466\n00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.629\nSo I did see it as I was doing some\nprep work for this course, but\n\n467\n00:22:58.629 --> 00:23:01.707\nI didn't see it before that point\nwhen I was just exploring it.\n\n468\n00:23:01.707 --> 00:23:03.525\nSo here it is.\n\n469\n00:23:03.525 --> 00:23:06.530\nNew mobile clock in and clock out.\n\n470\n00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.827\nThat's pretty nice.\n\n471\n00:23:07.827 --> 00:23:12.112\nSo you actually have to be able to do\nthat, but the great thing is if you go,\n\n472\n00:23:12.112 --> 00:23:16.139\nI'm just gonna keep adding in 15\nminutes every day to my schedule.\n\n473\n00:23:16.139 --> 00:23:19.229\nWell, whoever is managing the StaffHub\nwill be able to see that where you're\n\n474\n00:23:19.229 --> 00:23:20.713\nsaying, hey, I'm not doing that.\n\n475\n00:23:20.713 --> 00:23:23.771\nIt even has location detection on it too.\n\n476\n00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:26.245\nSo it can't be at your house and\nclock in, and\n\n477\n00:23:26.245 --> 00:23:31.562\ndrive to work Exactly which would yeah,\nthat's a little bit- It's kinda shaky.\n\n478\n00:23:31.562 --> 00:23:32.760\nIt is kinda shaky once\nwhen you tend to do that.\n\n479\n00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.642\n[LAUGH] But it yeah, it really does help\nthat they have actually thought about\n\n480\n00:23:37.642 --> 00:23:40.318\ninformation like this they can go to that.\n\n481\n00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:45.750\nSo that's kind of the management\nside of things once you're there.\n\n482\n00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:50.002\nNow there are a few other things and that\nwill kind of end our little episode here\n\n483\n00:23:50.002 --> 00:23:52.788\non just understanding\nStaffHub a little bit more.\n\n484\n00:23:52.788 --> 00:23:54.976\nThere is one other portal\nthat you got in here.\n\n485\n00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:58.183\nYou're not gonna get to\nportal.office.com for StaffHub.\n\n486\n00:23:58.183 --> 00:24:02.086\nBut I just showed you staffHub.Office.Com.\n\n487\n00:24:02.086 --> 00:24:07.043\nThere is also one more,\nif I do StaffHub.Office.Com/admin,\n\n488\n00:24:07.043 --> 00:24:08.493\nand I press Enter.\n\n489\n00:24:08.493 --> 00:24:15.580\nAnd if I'm already logged in it might, no.\n\n490\n00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.898\nI wasn't sure if it actually was gonna\nmake me log in again, but it is,\n\n491\n00:24:19.898 --> 00:24:21.520\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n492\n00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.461\nNow you'll see that there's actually\nthe idea here of Admin Settings.\n\n493\n00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:28.231\nSo this is really\nthe configuration overall,\n\n494\n00:24:28.231 --> 00:24:31.760\nlike if you first really\nwant to get started here.\n\n495\n00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.449\nLet's say that your organization\ndoesn't actually need this at all.\n\n496\n00:24:35.449 --> 00:24:37.671\nYou don't want somebody\njust kinda browsing and\n\n497\n00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:39.140\ngo, I wonder if I can do that?\n\n498\n00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.223\nI'll just go to StaffHub.com.\n\n499\n00:24:40.223 --> 00:24:41.940\nLook, I got an account.\n\n500\n00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.950\nEnable Microsoft StaffHub,\n\n501\n00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.850\nyou can simply just turn it off if\nyour organization doesn't use it.\n\n502\n00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:48.210\nThat would make sense.\n\n503\n00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.690\nAll data that was stored will\nbe deleted after 90 days, but\n\n504\n00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.700\nit has a retention policy,\nbut you can do that.\n\n505\n00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.450\nThe other thing, of course,\nhas to do with licensing.\n\n506\n00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:58.800\nIt will check whether or\n\n507\n00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.470\nnot your users have the proper\nlicensing to be able to do it.\n\n508\n00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.038\nCorporate Announcements\nallow certain people\n\n509\n00:25:05.038 --> 00:25:08.382\nto send announcements from\nOutlook to everyone on StaffHub.\n\n510\n00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:12.710\nSo let's say that in your grocery store,\n\n511\n00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.587\nright-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You don't have Outlook.\n\n512\n00:25:14.587 --> 00:25:15.289\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n513\n00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:16.230\nit's a chain.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n514\n00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.300\n&gt;&gt; And now\n\n515\n00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.490\nthere's a corporate policy\nthat gets passed down.\n\n516\n00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.380\nOr more than likely, the guy that\npassed out that corporate policy,\n\n517\n00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.340\nhe's probably not running StaffHub.\n&gt;&gt; Most likely.\n\n518\n00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:24.877\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n519\n00:25:24.877 --> 00:25:29.518\nit gives you this ability to then go,\nyeah, that corporate guy can essentially\n\n520\n00:25:29.518 --> 00:25:31.960\nsend out an email to StaffHub and then-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n521\n00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.173\nthe staff conversely do not\nhave established logins for\n\n522\n00:25:35.173 --> 00:25:39.118\na corporate account.\n&gt;&gt; But they do have StaffHub,\n\n523\n00:25:39.118 --> 00:25:40.790\nso-\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\n\n524\n00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.150\nnow notice that even though this says\nright here, it says we love to do that.\n\n525\n00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.880\nThis feature is rolling out,\nwill be available soon.\n\n526\n00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.460\nSo one of the features is brand spanking\nnew and the other one's like, yeah,\n\n527\n00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.170\nwe'll put it in there like it's real.\n&gt;&gt; We'll let you know it's coming.\n\n528\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll let you know it's coming.\n\n529\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.515\nBut if I try and click on the on,\nit's not there, so just go figure.\n\n530\n00:26:00.515 --> 00:26:05.023\nSelf Provision Accounts, okay,\nallows Microsoft StaffHub to\n\n531\n00:26:05.023 --> 00:26:09.540\ncreate Office 365 accounts for\nmy firstline workers.\n\n532\n00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.220\nAnd this is something you've\ngotta be careful with too, okay?\n\n533\n00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.360\nIt's great for supervising,\n\n534\n00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.842\nthat's why it's right here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n535\n00:26:15.842 --> 00:26:16.833\n&gt;&gt; If you go, look,\n\n536\n00:26:16.833 --> 00:26:21.530\nI don't really have access to the Office\n365 account to create accounts first and\n\n537\n00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.070\nthen come here.\n\n538\n00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:26.576\nBut I do know that I'm in charge of\nhiring the firstline workers, and\n\n539\n00:26:26.576 --> 00:26:28.820\nI need accounts in Office 365 to do this.\n\n540\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.612\nSo this is what gives you that ability,\nlike I was saying, that if they're not\n\n541\n00:26:32.612 --> 00:26:36.705\nreally in the system yet, if you turn that\non, you can add in somebody else's name.\n\n542\n00:26:36.705 --> 00:26:39.640\nAnd it'll automatically create\nthe account for you as well.\n\n543\n00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.050\nSo that way, it will get there.\n\n544\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:44.560\nBut just kind of remember that whether or\nnot you wanted to do that or\n\n545\n00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.180\nnot is all up to you.\n\n546\n00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.130\nSo if you turn that on,\n\n547\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.110\nnotice that it gives you\nthe ability to select the domain.\n\n548\n00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.320\nAnd here I have two domains.\n\n549\n00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.910\nThe original one that I provisioned\nthe entire tenancy with and\n\n550\n00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.798\nthen of course my added on\ndomain name that I added.\n\n551\n00:26:58.798 --> 00:27:01.999\nUsually, it's gonna be that one,\nthe one that you add in,\n\n552\n00:27:01.999 --> 00:27:05.792\nnot the one that you provision\nthe entire Office 365 tenancy with.\n\n553\n00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:10.420\nOf course, know the security group that it\nwill be a part of and the company name.\n\n554\n00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:15.151\nAnd if you want to be able to use\nOffice 365 Groups to essentially\n\n555\n00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:18.120\npopulate your StaffHub stuff, you can.\n\n556\n00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.730\nSo you can figure out how\nStaffHub utilizes these groups,\n\n557\n00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:25.647\nyou actually add in a prefix name and\nyou are off and ready to go.\n\n558\n00:27:25.647 --> 00:27:29.850\nYou can change the way that StaffHub\ndoes things as far as fields go.\n\n559\n00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:34.090\nAdd in custom ones that you want,\nonboarding, team setting, usage,\n\n560\n00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.520\nyou can track everything.\n\n561\n00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.840\nWhether they've actually done,\nif you want to,\n\n562\n00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.500\nI'm not saying that it's\nsomething you want to do.\n\n563\n00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.710\nBut let's say that you go,\nI wanna make sure that\n\n564\n00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.870\nthere's a particular file\nthat needs to be checked off.\n\n565\n00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.460\nSo let's say it's like a harassment\n\n566\n00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.270\npolicy.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n567\n00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.460\n&gt;&gt; Right, we wanna make sure\n\n568\n00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.500\neverybody read it.\n\n569\n00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.430\nWell, I might wanna keep\na checkmark of that.\n\n570\n00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.440\nNot that they told me that they did it,\nbut\n\n571\n00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.100\nlet me make sure that I have a way to mark\nthat and have that ability to do that.\n\n572\n00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.540\nYou can do that too, okay?\n\n573\n00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.793\nAnd of course, there's Employee Resources\nthat are internal to you.\n\n574\n00:28:06.793 --> 00:28:09.380\nAnd you wanna provide links for\nfor your employees as well.\n\n575\n00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:15.950\nNow all of that is actually inside\nof that Staffhub.office.com\\admin.\n\n576\n00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:20.093\nSo one side is basic configuration, right,\n\n577\n00:28:20.093 --> 00:28:24.250\nof whether or\nnot you want to allow it to work.\n\n578\n00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.817\nAnd then the other side of it is really\nthe management side of it is what we're\n\n579\n00:28:27.817 --> 00:28:28.501\nseeing here.\n\n580\n00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:35.750\nSo you're not gonna see this inside of\nthe portal.office.com proper, right?\n\n581\n00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:36.415\nSo we won't see it there.\n\n582\n00:28:36.415 --> 00:28:41.718\nBut if they ask you about managing\nStaffHub, and you can kind of see or\n\n583\n00:28:41.718 --> 00:28:46.290\nenvision a scenario where it's\nlike which of the following\n\n584\n00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:51.062\nwould be the appropriate place\nthat you can manage StaffHub?\n\n585\n00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:57.230\nWell, they might put portal.office.com and\ngo, yeah, no, that's not right.\n\n586\n00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.900\nIt makes sense, okay?\n\n587\n00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.410\nSo those are kind of the things that\nyou also want to keep in mind as well.\n\n588\n00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.830\nAnd usually, the admin page, if anything,\nis probably going to be whether or\n\n589\n00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:07.600\nnot you want to use it or not.\n\n590\n00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.930\nIf somebody says, hey,\nI can't get access to StaffHub and\n\n591\n00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:14.580\nthey're supposed to, verify right there\nwhether or not somebody has disabled it\n\n592\n00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.090\nto make sure that it hasn't\nbeen disabled on purpose.\n\n593\n00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.900\nIf it is, find out why.\n\n594\n00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.740\nAnd then if they did that,\n\n595\n00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.450\nsee if it can be enabled again\nif they actually need to use it.\n\n596\n00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.870\nBut if not, turning it off is\nalso not a bad idea as well.\n\n597\n00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.770\nBecause it's just another\nentry point that does connect\n\n598\n00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.060\nback into Office at some point.\n\n599\n00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.110\nSo if you don't need it,\nturn it off is a great feature.\n\n600\n00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:40.110\nSo, Daniel,\nthat is pretty much kind of a nice little\n\n601\n00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:44.640\ntour inside of the realm of StaffHub,\nand why we would choose to use it.\n\n602\n00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.385\nSo if you do have an organization that\ndoes combine that together, well,\n\n603\n00:29:48.385 --> 00:29:50.931\nStaffHub may be the solution for you.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie,\n\n604\n00:29:50.931 --> 00:29:54.430\nyou were a fantastic tour guide and\nactually you kinda sold me on the product.\n\n605\n00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.640\nIt's a nice product, especially for people\nthat run a support staff such as grocery\n\n606\n00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.565\nstores.\n&gt;&gt; Restaurants.\n\n607\n00:29:59.565 --> 00:30:01.209\n&gt;&gt; Or things like that we all have been\n\n608\n00:30:01.209 --> 00:30:03.210\ntalking about throughout this episode.\n\n609\n00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:03.860\nSo great stuff.\n\n610\n00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:04.410\nIf you're looking for\n\n611\n00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.330\nthat kinda solution, StaffHub may\nbe exactly what you're looking for.\n\n612\n00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.580\nSeems pretty simple to work with and use.\n\n613\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.259\nSo you might wanna least give\nit a look over one good time.\n\n614\n00:30:12.259 --> 00:30:13.830\nRonnie, thanks for joining us today.\n\n615\n00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:14.971\nWe

we're out of time for\nthis episode, so we're gonna sign off.\n\n618\n00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.125\nFor ITProTV,\n\n619\n00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:22.950\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt;
