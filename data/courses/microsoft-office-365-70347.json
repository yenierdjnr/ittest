          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.952\n[SOUND] Hello, we're here to\nintroduce you to an exciting new\n\n2\n00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:08.435\nseries starting right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:14.270\nWhen we take a look at enabling\nOffice 365 Services for Exam 70-347.\n\n4\n00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.068\nNow if that's what you're interested in,\nyou're in the right place, as we take you\n\n5\n00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:21.760\nthrough every single exam objective\ndomain that we have available to us.\n\n6\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.570\nMake sure that you do get the details\nbehind that to get prepared for the exam.\n\n7\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.170\nLet's take a look at my screen as we take\na look at some of these different details.\n\n8\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.760\nWhen it comes down to it\nyou'll want to go here first.\n\n9\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.919\nI simply used the search engine and\ntyped in Exam 70-347 and\n\n10\n00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:39.420\nthat led me to Microsoft's\nofficial exam page.\n\n11\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.630\nFor this particular exam, and\nin US dollars it's $165.00 US dollars\n\n12\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.600\nthat you'll have to pay to be\nable to sit for this exam.\n\n13\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.800\nSo make sure you check out\nwhatever the details and\n\n14\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.770\nthe costs are in your region, and\nthat will also help you out too.\n\n15\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.360\nNow, this page is not only of course,\nabout having to pay for the exam and\n\n16\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.420\nregister for the exam and schedule,\nand everything that you need to do.\n\n17\n00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.390\nBut it's right here,\n\n18\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.710\nwhich is really the main point of what\nwe want to make sure that we understand.\n\n19\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.604\nMicrosoft does not officially\ncall them objective domains,\n\n20\n00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:13.050\nright, in terms of what you and\nI normally would see.\n\n21\n00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.280\nThey call them skills measured here.\n\n22\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.303\nAnd then the skill measured, this is where\nit becomes a little bit confusing because\n\n23\n00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:22.970\nthey have updated the exams skills.\n\n24\n00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.960\nNormally, you do end up seeing these\nfour different domain objectives\n\n25\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.010\nwhich will normally focus\nin on each one of these.\n\n26\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.330\nMake sure that we do hit\nevery single detail in those\n\n27\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.550\nas far as every domain\nobjective that they have.\n\n28\n00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.580\nBut this last paragraph right before,\nsays as of June 2016,\n\n29\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.280\nplease download the change document.\n\n30\n00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.045\nAnd that means that the details for\nthe exams have changed a little bit.\n\n31\n00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:50.987\nThey've taken some of\nthe older products out,\n\n32\n00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:54.250\nsome of the things that they really didn't\nwant to cover and also added them in.\n\n33\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.510\nAnd they allow you to\nsee what has changed.\n\n34\n00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.440\nI went ahead and downloaded this, and this\nis what the document ends up looking like.\n\n35\n00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.615\nSo internally, they call them ODs or\n\n36\n00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:06.493\nobjective domains for\nenabling the services and\n\n37\n00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:11.140\nthis is what will show you what skills\nare actually going to be tested on, too.\n\n38\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.412\nNow you do wanna make sure that you\nnot only cover these as well, but\n\n39\n00:02:14.412 --> 00:02:16.640\nmake sure you have a good\nworking knowledge.\n\n40\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.710\nSo it really does give you the benefit,\n\n41\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.360\nif you've already been\nworking with Office itself.\n\n42\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.100\nIf you already had a little bit of\nexperience with Office 365, and of course,\n\n43\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.690\nthe networking side of that,\nif you're connecting in.\n\n44\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.120\nSo make sure you check out the 70-346\nshow before you go in and sit for\n\n45\n00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.540\nthis exam, too.\n\n46\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.220\nTake a look at some of the experience\nthat's required there,\n\n47\n00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.860\nthat they assume that you'll have\nthe knowledge for in this exam as well.\n\n48\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.900\nWhen it comes down to it,\n\n49\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.700\nwe'll be taking a look at the same\ntypes of objective domains here.\n\n50\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.989\nWe'll take a look at managing\nthe user driven deployments,\n\n51\n00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.050\nas well as IT driven deployments\nof Office 365 and Office 2016.\n\n52\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.715\nWe'll also set up telemetry and reporting,\n\n53\n00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:02.518\nas well as talking about\nthe idea of planning for\n\n54\n00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:07.190\nusers to be able to get everything\nworking on their system as well.\n\n55\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.150\nWe'll also take a look of course,\nat provisioning SharePoint Online\n\n56\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.430\nsite collections to make them\nwork the way that we want to.\n\n57\n00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.210\nAnd it's here beginning with the red.\n\n58\n00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.524\nAnd some of the things that you see\ncrossed out and the red that's also\n\n59\n00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:24.360\nreplaced it, shows you the changes in the\ndomain objectives that have also happened.\n\n60\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.790\nAlong with this, there is a phrase that\nyou should pay attention to throughout\n\n61\n00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.210\nthe entirety of everything that you\nstudy here for this particular exam.\n\n62\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.790\nIt's gonna be a phrase that repeats\nover and over again where it says,\n\n63\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.260\nusing web UI and Windows PowerShell.\n\n64\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.690\nYou're not going to get away on this\nexam without knowing the PowerShell.\n\n65\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.420\nMake sure you take time, study it,\nmake sure you're using it daily.\n\n66\n00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.710\nThat will help you out as you\nalso get ready for this exam.\n\n67\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.010\nThey expect you to know\nboth not just one or\n\n68\n00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.610\nthe other,\nmake sure you pay attention there too.\n\n69\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.230\nWe'll also of course, take a look at\nconfiguring Skype Online as well as Skype\n\n70\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.420\nfor Business for the end user settings.\n\n71\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.230\nAnd you'll see that we'll\ngo through each and\n\n72\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.980\nevery one of these different objectives\nwithin each smaller domain that we have.\n\n73\n00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.820\nLastly, of course, planning for Exchange\nOnline and Skype for Business too.\n\n74\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.580\nWhere we will end up seeing of course,\nmultiple settings that we\n\n75\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.510\nneed to be able to make sure that we\nunderstand and be able to configure.\n\n76\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.755\nAll along this, this entire time,\n\n77\n00:04:30.755 --> 00:04:34.620\nwe will show you where you have\nto be able to go into the web UI,\n\n78\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.510\nas well as the PowerShell to get things\nconfigured to get ready for the exam.\n\n79\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.637\nNow, if this is what you're looking for\nin preparing for the Office 70-347 exam,\n\n80\n00:04:45.637 --> 00:04:50.310\nwell, you're in the right place\nas we begin our journey together.\n\n81\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.740\nAnd you'll take a look and you'll see\nthat there's plenty for us to do.\n\n82\n00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.833\nSo if you're ready for that,\nmake sure you stay tuned for\n\n83\n00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.709\nthe next episode coming right up.\n\n84\n00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:02.299\n[SOUND]\n\n",
