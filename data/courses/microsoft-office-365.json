covering\n\n3\n00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.990\nthe 70-346 exam Managing Office\n365 Identities and Requirements.\n\n4\n00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.500\nHere to tell us a little bit more about\nwhat we can expect out of these videos\n\n5\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.480\nHere's the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.440\n>> Well thank you Mike\nas we continue on and\n\n7\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.310\ntaking a look at getting\ncertified in Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.340\nThat's where we are beginning right?\n\n9\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.450\nThere's an exam that covers the material\nthat we're actually going to be taking\n\n10\n00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.150\na look at and that is the exam labeled\nas 70-346 For what Mike was saying.\n\n11\n00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.510\nAnd let me show you the official\nexam page here, and\n\n12\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.360\nthat way we'll be able to see\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n13\n00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.680\nSo here on the website itself,\nthe MCSA part 1 exam 70-346 office 365.\n\n14\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.250\nAnd this is part one of the MCSA, so\n\n15\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.110\nthere's another series that's\ngonna be coming down the road.\n\n16\n00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.120\nBut this is the first in line\nthat you need to be familiar with\n\n17\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.780\nas you continue on towards your MCSA.\n\n18\n00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.610\nNow when we take a look at this, remember\nthat if you are in the United States,\n\n19\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.925\nthis exam is gonna cost you about 150.\n\n20\n00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:18.495\nDollars, and you will go ahead and sign\nup through whatever the exam center is.\n\n21\n00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.475\nSo make sure you take a look at that page.\n\n22\n00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:22.915\nYou can do your favorite search,\nand it will lead you right here.\n\n23\n00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:24.955\nIf you'll just search for\nthat exam number.\n\n24\n00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:27.416\nExam number 70-346.\n\n25\n00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.145\nNow as we take a look at this series,\n\n26\n00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.220\nthere's a couple of things that\nyou want to keep in mind here.\n\n27\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.200\nThis is not an exam for beginners and this\nis not saying that you cannot attempt it,\n\n28\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.660\nbut if you'll notice that they even tell\nyou some of the things you should be\n\n29\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.740\nfamiliar with if you are actually planning\nto take this particular exam here.\n\n30\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.130\nLet me go back to that webpage.\n\n31\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.900\nSo there it is.\n\n32\n00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.280\nThere's actually gonna be familiarity with\nOffice 365, the administration center\n\n33\n00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.760\nitself, as well as having an understanding\nof basic Microsoft Exchange Online,\n\n34\n00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.570\nSkype for Business Online,\nSharePoint Online, Office 365 Pro Plus,\n\n35\n00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.930\nin other words, their subscription As\nwell as basic Azure Active Directory.\n\n36\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.260\nAnd you wanna make sure that you do\nunderstand these fairly well before you\n\n37\n00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.370\nsit down for that exam.\n\n38\n00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.040\nAnd that's a basis requirement of\nwhat we're actually going to see.\n\n39\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.050\nSo there is some assumed knowledge as we\ngo throughout this pick or class as well.\n\n40\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.630\nNow what we're gonna focus in on,\nof course, are these exam objective areas.\n\n41\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.100\nAnd they've broken up into\nsix different areas for us.\n\n42\n00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.610\nSo the first thing that we\nfocus in on will be, of course,\n\n43\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.870\njust understanding how do we provision\nOffice 365 to work with our network,\n\n44\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.410\nand getting ready ready for that.\n\n45\n00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.740\nIf you haven't set it up,\n\n46\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.820\nwe show you the basics here of\nunderstanding how to get a tenant.\n\n47\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.630\nAnd then, how does that connect in with\nyour current on-premises active directory?\n\n48\n00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.140\nAnd we show you how to configure and\nadd that and begin to plan your own pilot.\n\n49\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.510\nThe way that they move through\noffice 365 is that they want you to\n\n50\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.180\nmove from the very fact of\na practice type of network,\n\n51\n00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.110\nall the way into a production very\nquickly by setting it up for you.\n\n52\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.600\nAs you;re actually practicing,\nyou're setting up for\n\n53\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.310\nproduction at the same time.\n\n54\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.350\nSo that's what they talk about\nin planning a pilot, and\n\n55\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.500\nwe go through that step by step.\n\n56\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.540\nThen we continue to move on\nthrough the content here,\n\n57\n00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.300\nby making sure that you understand that\nbasic networking has to be established\n\n58\n00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.520\nbetween your network on premise as\nwell as the Office 365 network.\n\n59\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.620\nAnd we talk about making sure that you\nunderstand how to configure your DNS to\n\n60\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.180\nwork with it as well as ensuring then\nthat you do have the client connectivity.\n\n61\n00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.450\nConnecting through a proxy\nserver if you need to and\n\n62\n00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.180\nfirewall issues that\nhave to be done as well.\n\n63\n00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.960\nThen of course,\nthere's rights management issues.\n\n64\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.870\nNo longer are you just protecting data and\n\n65\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.530\ndocuments that are actually\nwithin your network anymore.\n\n66\n00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.090\nNow that you're actually connecting\nonline there maybe rights management that\n\n67\n00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.570\nyou actually can deal with.\n\n68\n00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.240\nSo that even if those documents leave\n\n69\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.510\nyour own network that you still have the\nability to make that document protected,\n\n70\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.960\nand we talk about the basics here too.\n\n71\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.560\nThe other thing of course is understand\nthere's different rolls in managing office\n\n72\n00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.640\n365, we show you not only how\nto configure those rolls, but\n\n73\n00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.810\nwhat those rolls actually help us to do,\nand why we need them.\n\n74\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.040\nTo be able to separate out roles\nsuch as a tenant administrator\n\n75\n00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.890\nversus a password administrator and\neven some that are actually in between.\n\n76\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.730\nAnd we'll take a look at\neach one of those as well.\n\n77\n00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.210\nWe also of course go into\nmanaging our identities and\n\n78\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.330\nthis is about of course users.\n\n79\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.770\nWhat happens to the user?\n\n80\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.660\nAs we are now actually connected not only\nto the on-premise active directory, but\n\n81\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.020\nnow also into our cloud service\nthat we have to worry about and\n\n82\n00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.890\nhow do we get those\nconnections made right.\n\n83\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.670\nHow do we import users into the office\n365 management as we need to?\n\n84\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.470\nAnd then of course one of the most\npowerful tools that's out there\n\n85\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.120\nis going to be that windows powershell for\n\n86\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.610\noffice 365 that will allow us to go ahead\nand set up the connections that we need.\n\n87\n00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.220\nAnd even managed some of\nthe online on Office 365.\n\n88\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.450\nOf course,\nthen we also continue on to take a look,\n\n89\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.590\nnow, at what we call active\ndirectory synchronization.\n\n90\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.480\nThis is when you decide that you\nare now going through your pilot.\n\n91\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.880\nAnd now you want\na synchronization to happen.\n\n92\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.430\nSo that when you create an account on your\non premise active directory, it now also\n\n93\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.640\nappears and syncs up to, your active\ndirectory that's actually even behind\n\n94\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.810\nMicrosoft, there in the Azure cloud,\nas well, that's supporting Office 365.\n\n95\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.750\nAnd we'll walk through that\nstep by step as well, and\n\n96\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.060\nshow you how to sync, synchronize\nthose two directories together.\n\n97\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.350\nAnd then, of course, we get into one of\nthe major parts here that most people\n\n98\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.370\ndon't tend to implement, which is\ngonna be the idea of single sign-on.\n\n99\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.910\nNow that you have the actual single\nsign-on, or the things in place for\n\n100\n00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.070\nsingle sign-on,\n\n101\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.850\nyou're gonna also need to establish things\nlike Active Directory Federation Services,\n\n102\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.260\nso that now you actually present a single\nset of credentials, regardless of whether\n\n103\n00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.250\nyou're logging on to Office 365 Or\nwhether you're actually logging into\n\n104\n00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.880\nyour on-premises Active Directory network,\nwe show you how to plan that out and\n\n105\n00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.150\nunderstand the planning of\nthe Active Directory Federation services.\n\n106\n00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.130\nWe install the role, we configure it.\n\n107\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.795\nAnd we even add in a proxy server if\nyou're gonna have users from outside your\n\n108\n00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:25.630\non-premises active directory connecting\ninto both of those services as well.\n\n109\n00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.980\nAnd then lastly, of course, but\n\n110\n00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.330\nnot least by any comparison, we take\na look at monitoring and troubleshooting.\n\n111\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.730\nThese are some of the most intuitive tools\nthat we have in the online service for us,\n\n112\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.290\nbecause they pack them directly into the\nadmin center inside of the dashboard, so\n\n113\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.160\nthat we can access them easily.\n\n114\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.780\nThat way we know if there is\nactually issues going on with\n\n115\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.830\nOffice 365 online or is there something\nI need to trouble shoot here.\n\n116\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.250\nAnd if it's not in either place\nthen it's somewhere in-between.\n\n117\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.390\nThere are so many tools that are out there\nthat allows us to monitor it this stuff.\n\n118\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.500\nIt is very much an advantage\nas an office 365\n\n119\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.100\nadministrator needs to know them so that\nthey can actually go ahead and streamline.\n\n120\n00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.000\nWhat they need to do all the things\nthat they need to be able to manage\n\n121\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.230\nboth as well.\n\n122\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.210\nDon't forget to take advantage of some\nof the things that are also built in for\n\n123\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.280\nyou, since you do pay for\nthe Office 365 subscription at some time,\n\n124\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.310\nas you are actually going to\nimplement this into your network.\n\n125\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.320\nYou also have access, of course,\nto being able to open a service and\n\n126\n00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.720\nsupport ticket that gives you now direct\naccess to Office 365 support team too.\n\n127\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.390\nAnd the whole goal is to be able\nto isolate, just like we said.\n\n128\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.120\nIs it Office 365 issue?\n\n129\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.350\nIs it our own issue here?\n\n130\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.820\nIt isolates and then that way we\ncan troubleshoot where we need to.\n\n131\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.910\nSo if you are trying to get ready for\nthe exam 70-346, this series\n\n132\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.460\nwill cover all the objectives that you\nneed to help you to prepare for this exam.\n\n133\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.690\nNow remember that that's not\nwhat it's limited to, and\n\n134\n00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.260\nMicrosoft never says that, right?\n\n135\n00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.360\nThey say it's actually these\nthat we're gonna focus in on,\n\n136\n00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.290\nbut at the same time,\nthey rely on your previous skill and\n\n137\n00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.820\nknowledge with some of the tools that\nare also available for you out there.\n\n138\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.730\nSo if you're just trying to\nimplement Office 365, and\n\n139\n00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.300\ntrying to get started in that for\nyour network, or\n\n140\n00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.830\nif you're actually preparing for the exam,\nyou've come to the right place, and\n\n141\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.230\nthere's exciting shows for\nyou coming up in this series.\n\n142\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.360\nSo stay tuned for more.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.350\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're gonna take a look\n\n4\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.180\nat the Microsoft's, this is a mouthful,\nso I'm gonna make sure I say it right.\n\n5\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.760\nThis is the Managing Office\n365 Identities and\n\n6\n00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.710\nRequirements series that we're\nfiring up here at ITProTV studios.\n\n7\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.410\nAnd joining me to help\nMove along that mouthful\n\n8\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.900\nis none other than my good friend,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.770\nRonnie welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.880\nHow are you doing today sir?\n\n11\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.410\n>> I am doing fine today as we\ntake a look at getting started.\n\n12\n00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.940\nThat's what I'm gonna call it instead.\n\n13\n00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.780\nGetting started with Office 365 or\nof course taking we\n\n14\n00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.320\nget it from the standpoint of,\nwell an administrator, right?\n\n15\n00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.520\nThe very fact is that what happens with\nOffice 365 is something that is actually\n\n16\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.900\nneat, something that we really want in\nour businesses, and it has to do with\n\n17\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.830\nthe very fact that it's actually\nthe way that we can get Office 365 for\n\n18\n00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.250\nusers wherever they actually are.\n\n19\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.770\nSo when it comes down to\nactually needing software,\n\n20\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.510\nespecially productivity software\nlike the Office Suite well,\n\n21\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.190\nthat's actually been problematic in the\npast as I'm actually trying to deploy it.\n\n22\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.470\nAnd well, if we think about it, Daniel,\nthat's one of the most problematic things,\n\n23\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.435\nis when we get software\ninside of a business,\n\n24\n00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:26.700\nis trying to make sure that\neverybody gets access to it, right?\n\n25\n00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.010\n>> That's right.\nI mean, you gotta think about it.\n\n26\n00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.400\nYou got a bunch of end users,\nthey have workstations and\n\n27\n00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.090\ntypically the way we did it\ntraditionally was I would get,\n\n28\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.490\ndownload media, maybe a CD or\nmaybe an ISO, something to that effect.\n\n29\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.820\nI will have to go and sit down at\neach one of these computers and\n\n30\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.060\ninstall the software.\n\n31\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.730\nOr I could probably use some software\nmanagement systems things like\n\n32\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.560\nMicrosoft uses, Active Directories Group\nPolicy has the ability to do this,\n\n33\n00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.690\nto some extent I think also WSUS\nhad some ability to do this.\n\n34\n00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.530\nBut, that's a lot of\na administrative effort and\n\n35\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.850\nthat's why Office 365 has\nbecome the buzz work.\n\n36\n00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.880\nSo, Randy we really need to know,\nwhat is Office 365 and why is it awesome,\n\n37\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.040\nwhy do we think it's gonna be great and\nwe need to move to that.\n\n38\n00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.540\nHelp us get started there.\n\n39\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.010\n>> Sure thing,\nwell remember what Daniel just told us,\n\n40\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.940\nthe very fact is we know as\nadministrators that we can get\n\n41\n00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.050\nsoftware to the users that we want but\na lot of times it's also hit and miss.\n\n42\n00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.720\nEven though we might have actually thought\nthat we deployed it properly through\n\n43\n00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.020\nGroup Policy, there's at least one person\nthat didn't get it when they needed it to.\n\n44\n00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.660\nOr we might actually deploy it and\n\n45\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.240\nthen realize that we deployed\nit to too many people.\n\n46\n00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.820\nThe very fact is that there might have\nbeen a whole department out there that\n\n47\n00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.780\ndidn't need it at all, but now we've eaten\nup licenses by giving them access to it.\n\n48\n00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.520\nAnd what can we do?\n\n49\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.600\nWell, we can go back and say, oh,\n\n50\n00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.520\nwe've gotta actually remove that\nsoftware from your computer.\n\n51\n00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.910\nA lot of times as a lazy admin as I was,\nyou just kinda go, well,\n\n52\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.120\nwell we'll eat up five, six,\n15 licenses and don't worry about that.\n\n53\n00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.381\nWe just won't actually count that\nuntil it comes time for the audit\n\n54\n00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:57.870\nat the end of the year, and they're like,\nwell these people didn't need that\n\n55\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.510\nparticular software,\nso why is it out there?\n\n56\n00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.690\nWell, what does Office\n365 do that helps us?\n\n57\n00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.840\nWell Office 365 is a cloud provider.\n\n58\n00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.380\nThink of it as what we call\nsoftware as a service.\n\n59\n00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.530\nIn other words Microsoft went ahead and\nmade this decision here to sit there and\n\n60\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.820\ngo look one the problems is managing\njust the deployment of Office.\n\n61\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.940\nGetting it on to the computers\nthat need to be and\n\n62\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.500\nmake sure it's not on the computers\nthat need to be as well.\n\n63\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.250\nSo instead they've actually deployed\nsomething we call Office 365 other's built\n\n64\n00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.080\nit, to be able to say look, regardless\nof where you are in this world, and\n\n65\n00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.030\nregardless of the very fact that\nyou may have it on your computer or\n\n66\n00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.640\nnot, the very fact is it\nactually makes it easy to deploy.\n\n67\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.230\nNow no longer does Daniel\nhave to worry about, ooh,\n\n68\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.840\ndid I actually put it on\ntoo many computers or not.\n\n69\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.030\nOffice 365 can manage that for us, so\n\n70\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.650\nit can help us when managing\nthe licenses itself.\n\n71\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.650\nIt can also help us when somebody\ntakes something like a laptop,\n\n72\n00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.560\nthat you've assigned to them over\na couple of years and then I have\n\n73\n00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.520\nall this variable software on there\ncomputer like the entire Office product.\n\n74\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.640\nThey don't come back to work, and you're\ncalling them like we really need our\n\n75\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.900\nequipment back, and they're saying,\nsure thing, I'll return it next 2018.\n\n76\n00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.680\nYou know, a couple of years from now\nwhen they're actually done with it,\n\n77\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.710\ntheir computer.\n\n78\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.270\nSo you name it, those are problems.\n\n79\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.370\nWith Office 365 because the software\nas a service, they actually manage and\n\n80\n00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.340\ncontrol all the software.\n\n81\n00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.780\nAnd what does that actually do for\nus as admins inside of an IT shop?\n\n82\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.640\nWell it means that you and I can focus in\non the things that are really important.\n\n83\n00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.800\nIn other words, think about the idea\nof not having to worry about,\n\n84\n00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.070\ndid I have to manage the software or not.\n\n85\n00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.490\nIt's just the software's either gonna be\nthere or it's not gonna be there and then\n\n86\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.690\nwe can focus in on actually helping that\nsolution to work the way they want to.\n\n87\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.750\nInsuring that our email's\nactually working properly.\n\n88\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.580\nInsuring that our active\ndirectory is working and\n\n89\n00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.790\nalso being able to track it per device as\nwell as we have other things out there.\n\n90\n00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.340\nAs our computer networks\nbecome beyond the boarders of\n\n91\n00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.410\nthat building that we are working in\npeople are actually getting access to\n\n92\n00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.950\nsoftware on their mobile devices, tablets,\n\n93\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.960\nPC's, laptops you name it becomes\nharder and harder for us to control.\n\n94\n00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.760\nSo using Summit software as a service\nmakes it easily controllable\n\n95\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.155\nregardless of where they\nare on the planet and\n\n96\n00:05:10.155 --> 00:05:12.700\nthat's what we want to\nactually be able to get into.\n\n97\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.420\nMore and more shops are heading\ntowards something like Office 365,\n\n98\n00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.600\nbecause now instead of managing\nthousands of licenses and\n\n99\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.560\ntrying to figure out, man do I\nneed to keep track of that better?\n\n100\n00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.540\nWe simply go ahead and\nsay look, let's try and\n\n101\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.910\nthink about Office 365,\nthat will give me the email that I need,\n\n102\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.680\nprovide every single user with Office\n365 or the Office products that we need.\n\n103\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.630\nAnd we can control\nthe license very easily,\n\n104\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.480\nby simply clicking on a check mark or\nactually reducing the number of\n\n105\n00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.870\nsubscribers that we\nalso have on there too.\n\n106\n00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.500\nAnd that's what makes it easier.\n\n107\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.600\nNow when we start thinking about this\nthough, it also means that you and\n\n108\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.110\nI have to be smart then about managing and\nintegrating.\n\n109\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.770\nIn other words how to we get our shop to\nmove from what we actually know how to do\n\n110\n00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.220\nto also being able to use\nOffice 365 at the same time.\n\n111\n00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.080\nAnd that's what we're going to be\ntalking about throughout this series and\n\n112\n00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.480\ntrying to build that idea of those tools\nthat we need to understand some of\n\n113\n00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.980\nthe complexities behind Office 365 and\nintegrating that into our networks.\n\n114\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.800\nWe're going to be actually facing a lot\nof these different conditions but\n\n115\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.180\nthe very first thing we need to do is\nexactly that, is learn how to get started.\n\n116\n00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.340\n>> That's right.\n\n117\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.070\nAnytime you want to play with new\nsoftware, you can do one of two things.\n\n118\n00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.940\nYou can buy the software and just go out\nand say, I'm gonna purchase this and\n\n119\n00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.330\nwe're gonna use it, if I don't like it\nthen I guess I'll try to return it,\n\n120\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.350\nor something to that effect.\n\n121\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.320\nBut the good thing is,\n\n122\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.390\nis that most software companies\nnowadays specifically Microsoft,\n\n123\n00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.410\nthis is a Microsoft class, is that they,\nthey give you some trial periods.\n\n124\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.500\nI know Ronnie is chomping at the bit\nto show us how to work with this.\n\n125\n00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.970\nI'm really looking forward to this Ronnie\nbecause Office 365 obviously gives us some\n\n126\n00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:54.810\nbenefits right, it helps us really have\ncontrol over the economics of it right?\n\n127\n00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.400\nWe're not paying for\nmore than what we're using.\n\n128\n00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.740\nThat's one of the main benefits of this.\n\n129\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.790\nAlso our management becomes a whole lot\nmore centralized and whole lot more easy,\n\n130\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.580\neliminating a lot of what Ronnie was\ntalking about just a minute ago.\n\n131\n00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.780\nSo Ronnie, that being said show\nus how we can get some practical\n\n132\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.790\nseat time with Office365.\n\n133\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.840\n>> Right, well the nice thing about\nit is regardless of whether you're\n\n134\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.300\nalready representing an organization or\nnot you can sign up for\n\n135\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.740\nwhat we call a trial account and\n\n136\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.920\nthat will give you 30 days of access to\nbe able to take a look and explore it.\n\n137\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.910\nMicrosoft really wants you\nto take advantage of this so\n\n138\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.975\nmuch so, that you know,\nof course if you're studying and\n\n139\n00:07:31.975 --> 00:07:34.750\nactually trying to get ready for\nan exam you can do the same thing.\n\n140\n00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.000\nBut the other thing about this is that,\n\n141\n00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.060\nthey want to actually build this\nprocess into this point, where\n\n142\n00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.180\nas long as you're a single user there\nis a couple of things you need, right.\n\n143\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.450\nOne, you need a valid email account if you\nwant to get started with a trial account.\n\n144\n00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.379\nThat's pretty much about it and\nyou need to be able to use a name.\n\n145\n00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:54.304\nYou can't just use a generic\nname like admin or\n\n146\n00:07:54.304 --> 00:07:56.712\nsystemadmin or something like that.\n\n147\n00:07:56.712 --> 00:07:58.836\nSo it's not exactly that difficult.\n\n148\n00:07:58.836 --> 00:08:02.234\nSo when you actually do that there's\na couple of different things like I said,\n\n149\n00:08:02.234 --> 00:08:05.629\nyou need a valid email address, you need\nto make sure that you can use a real name\n\n150\n00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:08.850\nwhen you're actually creating\nthe very trial account itself.\n\n151\n00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.360\nYou need to make sure that you decide on\nwhat plan that you think you're gonna\n\n152\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.260\nfocus in on and the good thing is\nMicrosoft's website or Office 365's\n\n153\n00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.460\nwebsite tend to describe in detail\nwhat each of these plans really does.\n\n154\n00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.510\nThey have everything from things\nlike single user, home user,\n\n155\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.660\nstudent users going all the way up\nto governmental level use as well.\n\n156\n00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.300\nAnd of course, there's different\nrequirements for each one of those.\n\n157\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.870\nBut your focus then is actually to figure\nout whether it's something you want for\n\n158\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.850\nyourself.\n\n159\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.450\nWhether it's something\nthat you actually want for\n\n160\n00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.370\nyour entire business, whatever that\nplan may be, you want to focus in and\n\n161\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.260\nunderstand what you're actually going\nto be trying to get yourself into.\n\n162\n00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.740\nIf you are actually thinking about\ndoing this as a trial period for\n\n163\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.180\nan organization,\n\n164\n00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.510\nyou also need to get some organizational\ninformation right at the beginning.\n\n165\n00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.440\nNow, this is nothing that will lock you\ninto any particular plan, at that point,\n\n166\n00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.380\nbecause it's a free trial that you'll\nhave, so at the end of that trial,\n\n167\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.840\nif you don't want it,\nyou just let it expire.\n\n168\n00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.590\nOf course, anything else, right, Microsoft\nwill continue to contact you because they\n\n169\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.090\nbelieve that this is an opportunity for\nthem to market but you're actually getting\n\n170\n00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.702\nuse of their entire program as\nyou're doing it for right now.\n\n171\n00:09:15.702 --> 00:09:17.861\nAnd then you just simply\ncomplete the process.\n\n172\n00:09:17.861 --> 00:09:22.255\nSo it's fairly simple in getting started\nbut how do we actually or what are some of\n\n173\n00:09:22.255 --> 00:09:26.456\nthe things we need to pay attention to,\nbecause as we get started the one thing\n\n174\n00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:31.180\nthat you want to treat this as, is as if\nyou're actually going to implement it.\n\n175\n00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.100\nSo even if this is a trial for you,\nyou need to make sure you treat it as\n\n176\n00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.480\nsomething that you go, hey, I'm actually\ngoing to be doing this for real.\n\n177\n00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.880\nSo the easiest thing to do let's go and\n\n178\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.170\ntake a look in my computer here is\nwe will get started in this way.\n\n179\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.286\nSo all I did is I went to my\nfavorite search engine and\n\n180\n00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:51.288\nI typed in Office 360 free trial and when\nI did so, I think it's like the first or\n\n181\n00:09:51.288 --> 00:09:54.790\nsecond link on that page and\nit brings me up to right here.\n\n182\n00:09:54.790 --> 00:10:00.262\nOkay, and so the basic trial account that\nwe have is one of the subscriptions for\n\n183\n00:10:00.262 --> 00:10:04.933\nOffice 365 which is called\nOffice 365 Enterprise E3 trial.\n\n184\n00:10:04.933 --> 00:10:05.676\nThere's an E1.\n\n185\n00:10:05.676 --> 00:10:06.292\nThere's an E2.\n\n186\n00:10:06.292 --> 00:10:08.149\nThere's an E3, E4, E5.\n\n187\n00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.215\nYou name it, they have those.\n\n188\n00:10:09.215 --> 00:10:12.010\nAnd then they have\ngovernmental levels as well.\n\n189\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.840\nThis particular trial expands\nout to about 25 users.\n\n190\n00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.400\nGet SS familiar Office applications for\nyour PCs or Mac.\n\n191\n00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.020\nSo what do they normally mean?\n\n192\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.410\nThis means that you'll get access\nto things like Word, Excel,\n\n193\n00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.760\nPower Point, those types of\nprograms that you'll generally see.\n\n194\n00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.680\nYour email, of course Outlook and\ndocuments that you'll have access to,\n\n195\n00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.610\na lot of times you also get administrative\ntools to be able to manage multiple users.\n\n196\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.180\nYou also have access to\ndata loss prevention.\n\n197\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.570\nAgain, that's a trial period.\n\n198\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.810\nSo just kinda remember,\n\n199\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.800\nanything that you stick up there, in the\nend what are they gonna do if you do this?\n\n200\n00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.370\nI don't recommend you actually use this\nunless you're actually doing it for\n\n201\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.060\na trial and then make sure you have\na copy of all your software, or\n\n202\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.610\nwhatever you put up there cuz\nmake sure you get it all out.\n\n203\n00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.860\nThat is what you wanna do.\n\n204\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.810\nIf not, they'll still hold it up there for\nyou, waiting for you to pay at some point.\n\n205\n00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.650\nThey're not gonna get rid of that data for\nawhile, but\n\n206\n00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.460\nyou still have access to it\nat some point if you need it.\n\n207\n00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.670\nAnd now archiving compliance.\n\n208\n00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.960\nTeam sites for project management.\n\n209\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.590\nYou name it,\nthey have collaboration built in.\n\n210\n00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:13.690\nThey have all this.\n\n211\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.970\nNow this E3 account is\nprobably the most generic and\n\n212\n00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.830\nby far their most popular type of account\nthat they want you to start out with.\n\n213\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.060\nWhy do they do this?\n\n214\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.480\nWell, they want you, if you are going to\nbe the person that's really going to be\n\n215\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.870\nspearheading and championing the move to\nOffice 365, to be able to come in and\n\n216\n00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.880\ngo look, I didn't want to\ncreate just a two user license.\n\n217\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.460\nWell, can you?\n\n218\n00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.299\nYeah.\nOkay, but\n\n219\n00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:38.666\nin the end they wanted you to at least get\nstarted here to where all of a sudden you\n\n220\n00:11:38.666 --> 00:11:42.239\nrealize that you're in the middle of this,\nand you're like, I really like this,\n\n221\n00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:45.656\nyou just start adding users in, and then\nall of a sudden, your users go ahead and\n\n222\n00:11:45.656 --> 00:11:48.039\nthey transition over, and\nthey're perfectly fine.\n\n223\n00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:49.945\nIt gives up to 25 at the beginning,\n\n224\n00:11:49.945 --> 00:11:54.124\nthey of course are hoping that once you\nget that 25 limit, you have 50 users,\n\n225\n00:11:54.124 --> 00:11:57.709\nyou just upgrade to the next license,\nand off and you are ready to go.\n\n226\n00:11:57.709 --> 00:12:00.947\nSo, the good thing is you've already\nset up a lot if you start doing this.\n\n227\n00:12:00.947 --> 00:12:05.730\nSo, let's take a look at some of\nthe things you need to take a look at,\n\n228\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:10.678\nwhich is over here on the left hand\nside and let me zoom in a little bit so,\n\n229\n00:12:10.678 --> 00:12:14.582\nthat we can see it a little\nbit better view, okay [COUGH].\n\n230\n00:12:14.582 --> 00:12:17.078\nPardon me, sorry.\n\n231\n00:12:19.377 --> 00:12:22.999\nAll right, so over here on the left\nhand side as we setup the account,\n\n232\n00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:26.121\nall of these are fields that you\nsee with the asterisk in it,\n\n233\n00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:30.069\nwhich means you have to answer them,\nand you need to answer them honestly.\n\n234\n00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:31.784\nI know it's easier to go oh,\n\n235\n00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:36.511\nI'm never gonna answer these types of\nthings honestly but you really need to.\n\n236\n00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:40.090\nThis first one doesn't seem like\nsomething that's super important here.\n\n237\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.370\nBut notice it says country or\nregion at the beginning, and\n\n238\n00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.300\nthat is because they don't want\na robot filling this thing out.\n\n239\n00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.793\nNow what am I talking about?\n\n240\n00:12:47.793 --> 00:12:50.773\nWell they don't want somebody coming\nin and filling this thing out and\n\n241\n00:12:50.773 --> 00:12:53.213\nthen not being able to respond and\nanswer in the end here.\n\n242\n00:12:53.213 --> 00:12:58.156\nSo what they do is that they are going\nto send you a confirmation code of some\n\n243\n00:12:58.156 --> 00:12:59.460\nsort here.\n\n244\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.430\nSo when they do that it's gonna be to\nsome phone number is what's gonna end up\n\n245\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.440\nhappening and this is how they actually\ndecide on that phone number and\n\n246\n00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.430\nhow they get that information to you.\n\n247\n00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.140\nSo when I select this I wanna\nmake sure I go down here and\n\n248\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.390\nI am in the United States right now.\n\n249\n00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.230\nSo I am going to select\nthe United States and\n\n250\n00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.880\nlook at what it says\nright immediately there.\n\n251\n00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.560\nYou can't change this after you sign up.\n\n252\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.730\nSo they are really kinda pinning\nthat down right then too.\n\n253\n00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:30.450\nAnd then of course we are going to use a\nname and I am just gonna use my name here\n\n254\n00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.080\ncuz it does need that and\nit needs a valid email address.\n\n255\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.300\nSo note it says email address is important\nbecause this is where notifications\n\n256\n00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.760\nare going to go in the beginning.\n\n257\n00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.440\nIn other words if somebody\nneeds to reset a password,\n\n258\n00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.650\nthey're going to also\nsend this here to you.\n\n259\n00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.230\nSo what we're setting up at the very\nbeginning here is that we are creating\n\n260\n00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.410\nwhat we call a tenant, right so\nthat's what we're doing here.\n\n261\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:59.930\nSo the account that I have\nis gonna be 365@outlook.com.\n\n262\n00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.512\nSo we'll actually use that and\nthen it's giving me an address.\n\n263\n00:14:02.512 --> 00:14:06.830\nAnd our address here, is, this.\n\n264\n00:14:09.734 --> 00:14:13.130\nI think.\n[LAUGH] 4th BLVD.\n\n265\n00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.350\nAnd we're in Gainesville.\n\n266\n00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.080\nAnd we are actually in\nthe great state of Florida.\n\n267\n00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.930\nAnd our zip code,\nat least I think that's gonna be it.\n\n268\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:31.550\nAnd so here it is, I'm gonna also enter in\nmy name right here, and my phone number.\n\n269\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.842\nSo let's do this as well.\n\n270\n00:14:37.407 --> 00:14:39.229\n386.\n\n271\n00:14:43.918 --> 00:14:49.642\nAnd then the organization name\nis going to be itprotvdemo.\n\n272\n00:14:52.323 --> 00:14:53.620\nAnd I'm gonna do that.\n\n273\n00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.970\nAnd on the User ID, it's gonna ask\nme what I want to sign in as and\n\n274\n00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.470\nI'm simply gonna state Ronald.\n\n275\n00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.751\nAnd then of course it's asking me to\nenter in a strong password for this.\n\n276\n00:15:11.873 --> 00:15:13.922\nAnd I'll create a strong password, and\n\n277\n00:15:13.922 --> 00:15:18.490\nthen it's gonna ask me whether it wants to\ntext me, or whether I want it to call me.\n\n278\n00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.677\nI'm simply gonna ask\nit to text me instead.\n\n279\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.939\nOops, oh, oh, that makes sense.\n\n280\n00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.680\nAnd so\nit needs to actually text me something.\n\n281\n00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.893\nSo this is where you\nneed that second factor,\n\n282\n00:15:36.893 --> 00:15:39.175\nwhich is going to be my\ncell phone number here.\n\n283\n00:15:39.175 --> 00:15:41.578\nAnd in a moment, it's going to ask me for\n\n284\n00:15:41.578 --> 00:15:45.490\na verification code as it finishes\ntexting me at some point here.\n\n285\n00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.695\n>> So send your mass texts to-\n>> That's right.\n\n286\n00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:50.309\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go, so\n\n287\n00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:52.087\nas soon as I find that number.\n\n288\n00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:55.504\nOop, there it went.\n\n289\n00:15:55.504 --> 00:15:57.462\nI need to make sure I\nfind that number here.\n\n290\n00:15:59.546 --> 00:16:03.813\nAnd so every time that you do it, of\ncourse, it would be a different number so,\n\n291\n00:16:03.813 --> 00:16:05.705\nlet me make sure I can type that in.\n\n292\n00:16:09.744 --> 00:16:14.231\n5329 so, oops, of course,\n\n293\n00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:21.620\nI need to actually type that in there,\n955329.\n\n294\n00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.556\nAnd then I simply go ahead and\ncreate the account and it processes.\n\n295\n00:16:25.556 --> 00:16:28.637\nAnd it should generate for\nme what we call the idea of a tenant,\n\n296\n00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:30.665\nwhen everything is actually done here.\n\n297\n00:16:33.844 --> 00:16:38.906\n>> Ronnie, I'm not sure that I'm 100%\nup to speed on what a tenant is.\n\n298\n00:16:38.906 --> 00:16:39.603\nWhat is a tenant?\n\n299\n00:16:39.603 --> 00:16:42.561\n>> Well, because we're actually\nusing a cloud service, right,\n\n300\n00:16:42.561 --> 00:16:45.370\nbecause we're actually using\nsoftware as a service.\n\n301\n00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.710\nRemember that Microsoft essentially\nhas built the entire platform, and\n\n302\n00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:54.440\nwhat you and I are doing is just really\npaying for access to that software.\n\n303\n00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.625\nSo you and I are almost renting\nan actual office inside of Office 365.\n\n304\n00:16:59.625 --> 00:17:02.243\nAnd now we're actually\ngetting access into it, and\n\n305\n00:17:02.243 --> 00:17:04.636\nwe're seeing all things\nthat can be done here.\n\n306\n00:17:04.636 --> 00:17:06.651\nLet me change that back\nout a little bit so\n\n307\n00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:09.240\nthat we can see a little bit better here.\n\n308\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.830\nAt least I think so,\nmaybe I could be wrong.\n\n309\n00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.334\nSo this is normally what ends up\nhappening, is it brings you out to,\n\n310\n00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:19.070\nof course, Office 365 at the very\nbeginning, and there it is.\n\n311\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:23.500\nSo I have my itprotvdemo account and\nthere are certain things here.\n\n312\n00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.740\nNow, right here at the beginning,\nthe reason why it actually created it so\n\n313\n00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.560\nquickly is that there's nothing\nactually involved in it yet.\n\n314\n00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.340\nSo we haven't set up anything.\n\n315\n00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.048\nWe've just essentially said\nhere's my sign up, and\n\n316\n00:17:34.048 --> 00:17:36.584\nI'm ready to actually get\nstarted at this point.\n\n317\n00:17:36.584 --> 00:17:41.407\nAnd so there's still a few things that we\nhave to be able to do if we are actually\n\n318\n00:17:41.407 --> 00:17:44.687\ngoing to make sure that\nwe configure Office 365.\n\n319\n00:17:44.687 --> 00:17:48.911\nSo normally what ends up happening is,\nif I go back over here, let me click on\n\n320\n00:17:48.911 --> 00:17:53.209\nthe Office 365 icon and logo,\nmost of the time you'll actually see this.\n\n321\n00:17:53.209 --> 00:17:56.622\nIf you buy it, of course,\nthis trial version will actually be gone.\n\n322\n00:17:56.622 --> 00:18:00.392\nAfter a while you're gonna see the trial\nversion will also say purchase now or\n\n323\n00:18:00.392 --> 00:18:02.300\nbuy now or whatever it might be.\n\n324\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.050\nBut this is where the interface\nof the user comes in.\n\n325\n00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.284\nSo you'll actually see,\n\n326\n00:18:06.284 --> 00:18:09.660\nand it's still setting up all of\nthese different aspects of it.\n\n327\n00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:14.499\nSo there's Outlook getting set up,\nthere's the calendar, there's the people,\n\n328\n00:18:14.499 --> 00:18:15.531\nthe news reader.\n\n329\n00:18:15.531 --> 00:18:20.230\nThere's the OneDrive service, Word, Excel,\n\n330\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:24.530\nPowerPoint, and of course the OneNote.\n\n331\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.740\nAll that stuff is still getting set up for\nall the users that are involved right now.\n\n332\n00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:34.090\nSo you'll see that you have that ability\nto get that started right that quickly.\n\n333\n00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.940\nNow for one user it's no big deal.\n\n334\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.670\nOnce we start adding other users into it,\nwell then we actually have to pay\n\n335\n00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.090\nattention a little bit more\nas we start creating it.\n\n336\n00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.370\nSo it's very important that you sign up\nwith all of the relevant information that\n\n337\n00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.520\nyou're gonna do for\n\n338\n00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.090\nwhat you think is gonna become\nyour permanent account one day.\n\n339\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.734\nThe reason why is that Microsoft wants to\nmove you on what they call a fast track\n\n340\n00:18:56.734 --> 00:18:57.597\ndeployment.\n\n341\n00:18:57.597 --> 00:19:00.912\nAnd that's everything you're\ndoing right now in terms of\n\n342\n00:19:00.912 --> 00:19:05.663\na demo account can then be easily switched\nover into a production account later on.\n\n343\n00:19:05.663 --> 00:19:09.728\nAs you decide and go, hey, I really like\nwhat I'm actually experiencing right now,\n\n344\n00:19:09.728 --> 00:19:12.833\nthat you don't have to kinda scrap\nyour entire demonstration and\n\n345\n00:19:12.833 --> 00:19:14.560\nthen start all over again.\n\n346\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.830\nSo that's why you wanna make sure that you\ndo enter in the real information that you\n\n347\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.450\nneed to and get everything set up\nthe way that you want to as well.\n\n348\n00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.430\nSo as it starts populating, and\n\n349\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.970\nthis is something you do have\nto also be careful of as well.\n\n350\n00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.320\nJust because you go ahead and get it\nstarted right at the beginning here,\n\n351\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.120\nit may take some time just\nlike it's doing right now.\n\n352\n00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.690\nSometimes, depending on how many\npeople you end up starting off with,\n\n353\n00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.500\nor how busy the servers are,\nit can take well,\n\n354\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.410\na couple hours even, as everything's\ngetting set up, or even up to an hour.\n\n355\n00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.700\nSometimes it can take longer,\n\n356\n00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.540\ndepending on how much stuff has to be\nactually added into the account as well.\n\n357\n00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.770\nSo at the beginning here, when we\ntalk about the idea of provisioning,\n\n358\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:57.900\nwe have just gotten started with this\nidea of provisioning the tenant name and\n\n359\n00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.950\nthe tenant region,\nbecause those are really important.\n\n360\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.430\nRemember that you cannot\nuse a generic name.\n\n361\n00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.430\nThere also needs to be an email account\nthat is actually a valid email account\n\n362\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.720\nthat you tie this to.\n\n363\n00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.693\nNow speaking of that of course,\n\n364\n00:20:11.693 --> 00:20:15.282\nthat means you do need to follow\nsome best practices here.\n\n365\n00:20:15.282 --> 00:20:19.250\nOn that email account, you wanna make\nsure that's an email account that will be\n\n366\n00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.820\navailable to you, regardless of who\nactually has that email account.\n\n367\n00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.590\nNow, on mine, because I'm doing this as\na demonstration, I'm the only one and\n\n368\n00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.570\nthat account will never be\nused pretty much after this.\n\n369\n00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.450\nBut the very fact is, if you're doing\nthis, you want to actually make sure\n\n370\n00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.990\nthat the email that you use here,\nyou can get emails to it.\n\n371\n00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.230\nBut then it's also not just tied\nto one particular individual.\n\n372\n00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:43.309\nIf that individual, if I happen to leave\nyour organization, and that's my email\n\n373\n00:20:43.309 --> 00:20:47.328\naccount, well, all of your admin\nstuff is gonna be tied to me instead.\n\n374\n00:20:47.328 --> 00:20:50.630\nSo you wanna make sure that you\nactually do use some email account\n\n375\n00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.160\nthat's not gonna go away at some point in\nthe future if somebody ends up leaving.\n\n376\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.390\nMake sure you pick that out.\n\n377\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.468\nMake sure you use a real name,\n\n378\n00:20:56.468 --> 00:20:59.240\nit's not gonna be one that's\ngonna be generic as well.\n\n379\n00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.348\nSo there are certain things\nthat you also want to do.\n\n380\n00:21:01.348 --> 00:21:04.120\nYou also wanna make sure\nthat you do produce\n\n381\n00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.090\na password that's fairly complex here too.\n\n382\n00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.940\nNormally when you set up\nthis idea of the passwords,\n\n383\n00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.630\nit has to be at least 10 characters,\nbut at least in the last year or\n\n384\n00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.820\nso, they used to limit\nyou to 14 characters.\n\n385\n00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.280\nAnd that can bring kind of\nfrustration to people like, well,\n\n386\n00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.660\nDaniel, who likes to use\na 24 character password.\n\n387\n00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.380\nSo you do have to worry, and\n\n388\n00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.350\nthey might have actually removed\nthat limitation the last few months.\n\n389\n00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.680\nBut at least I know\nabout a year ago though,\n\n390\n00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.740\nthe limitation was between 10 and\n14 characters.\n\n391\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.562\nAnd every time when I actually\nuse my LastPass, right,\n\n392\n00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:39.790\nI generate a 16 character password.\n\n393\n00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:41.660\nIt just kept rejecting mine, I was like!\n\n394\n00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.601\nAnd then I finally looked, and\nthere it was, it was like, between 10 and\n\n395\n00:21:44.601 --> 00:21:45.820\n14 characters.\n\n396\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.367\nWell, that's kind of a weird\nlimitation in today's world, so\n\n397\n00:21:48.367 --> 00:21:50.550\nthey may have actually\nchanged that as well.\n\n398\n00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.480\nSo there are some limitations and\n\n399\n00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.300\nsome best practices you wanna follow right\naway as you start getting access here.\n\n400\n00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.520\nSo if you're actually\ngonna be the admin then,\n\n401\n00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.560\nand you're starting to do the provisioning\nhere, what you wanna make sure of is\n\n402\n00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.260\nall that stuff is actually the way we\nwant to and then it get it started.\n\n403\n00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.810\nNow, there are a couple of things\nwe want to point out right now.\n\n404\n00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:15.640\nSo because I got this E3 account here,\nthe very fact is that there's sometimes,\n\n405\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.170\nwe can actually have errors that\nmay creep up during that process.\n\n406\n00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:24.171\nSo usually the big error is when\nyou enter in, a lot of the times,\n\n407\n00:22:24.171 --> 00:22:25.666\nthe name itself, too.\n\n408\n00:22:25.666 --> 00:22:29.626\nIs that on the name, if it's been taken up\nby somebody, it's probably not gonna give\n\n409\n00:22:29.626 --> 00:22:33.036\nyou that name again, so it's gonna\ntell yeah, you can't use that name.\n\n410\n00:22:33.036 --> 00:22:36.426\nIt will go through and check all of\nthe list of DNS names that it has and\n\n411\n00:22:36.426 --> 00:22:39.477\nit gives you that ability to have\nthe name then you can use it.\n\n412\n00:22:39.477 --> 00:22:42.670\nIf not, they're actually\nrejecting it right then and there.\n\n413\n00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:47.461\nAnd so a lot of times, even if you might\nhave a duplicate name, Office 365 can,\n\n414\n00:22:47.461 --> 00:22:49.693\ndepending on the domain name itself.\n\n415\n00:22:49.693 --> 00:22:52.828\nIn other words, whether or\nnot it's registered with Office 365.\n\n416\n00:22:52.828 --> 00:22:57.312\nThey might add in a number to the end\nof it to make sure it's a unique name\n\n417\n00:22:57.312 --> 00:22:58.530\ninstead.\n\n418\n00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:02.620\nNow the funny thing is, if you actually\nare using this to try and create something\n\n419\n00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.460\nfor a governmental account though, they do\nhave some weird limitations right, Daniel?\n\n420\n00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.680\n>> Yeah, they do have that.\n\n421\n00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.620\nWe were actually musing\nabout this before the show.\n\n422\n00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.470\nIt's quite funny, is they will not allow\nyou, if you're in a government agency,\n\n423\n00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.700\nsomehow, someway, we were talking\nabout how this is possible.\n\n424\n00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.820\nYou can't use what they would\ncall an offensive name.\n\n425\n00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.000\nWhich, I mean, if you think about that,\nthat makes sense, right?\n\n426\n00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.580\nYou don't want to, as Ronnie said,\nif you work for the Wildlife, Fish and\n\n427\n00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.138\nGame Commission or something like that.\n\n428\n00:23:31.138 --> 00:23:33.913\nYou wanna say Fish and Game Sucks.\n\n429\n00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.515\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's my name.\n\n430\n00:23:35.515 --> 00:23:37.861\nThat's not gonna fly,\nthey don't want you to do that.\n\n431\n00:23:37.861 --> 00:23:39.749\nAnd obviously you're\na disgruntled employee anyway and\n\n432\n00:23:39.749 --> 00:23:42.775\nthey're probably gonna take a look at\nyou as soon as you create that name.\n\n433\n00:23:42.775 --> 00:23:43.420\nBut Ronnie,\n\n434\n00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.528\nhow is it that they do determine whether\nsomething is offensive or un-offensive?\n\n435\n00:23:47.528 --> 00:23:49.448\n>> Yeah [LAUGH] well,\nthe government itself, right,\n\n436\n00:23:49.448 --> 00:23:51.962\nhas regulations about how their\nname actually ends up appearing.\n\n437\n00:23:51.962 --> 00:23:56.171\nMicrosoft has built a list of these names,\nand they go ahead and they put it in there\n\n438\n00:23:56.171 --> 00:23:59.837\nso that if you do enter in something\nlike What we were musing about this.\n\n439\n00:23:59.837 --> 00:24:04.330\nWe don't like this department and\nyou use some expletive along with that.\n\n440\n00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.360\nThen more than likely it's not\ngonna allow you to create that.\n\n441\n00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.620\nSo, you do have that option.\n\n442\n00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.060\nAnd there is a government list that\nactually says, yes, you cannot\n\n443\n00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.090\nuse these names in combination with things\nlike profanity and some different things.\n\n444\n00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:17.510\nSo do you have to worry about that.\n\n445\n00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.340\nBut usually that provisioning of the name,\n\n446\n00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.260\nthat's probably the most\nfrustrating thing.\n\n447\n00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.150\nIf you haven't actually\nowned that domain name,\n\n448\n00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.720\none of the things that they do recommend\nthat you do have on hand, of course,\n\n449\n00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.320\nthen, is make sure you go out and\nregister the domain name that you want.\n\n450\n00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.270\nSo you wanna make sure\nthat you do that as well.\n\n451\n00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.910\nNow the other thing, of course,\nis that you might have to be very\n\n452\n00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.930\npatient like the government accounts\nbecause they're going beyond.\n\n453\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.780\nThey're test bed of users\nis not gonna be 25 users.\n\n454\n00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:50.860\nIt might be like 200, 300 maybe 500 users\nmay actually be the test environment.\n\n455\n00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.450\nIt takes a bit of time.\n\n456\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:56.940\nIt can take anywhere between\nthree hours to 72 hours before\n\n457\n00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:02.270\nthe entire process of what I just showed\nyou is set up and ready to go as well.\n\n458\n00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:08.910\nSo you need to actually be very much\nat the beginning here as honest as you\n\n459\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:13.160\ncan in answering all those questions and\nthen make sure that everything is set up.\n\n460\n00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.040\nSo, be patient make sure you do\nset it up because in the future\n\n461\n00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.390\ninstead of you going oh crud,\n\n462\n00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.160\nI shouldn't have actually put in that\nsilly little name with my domain name.\n\n463\n00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.950\nWell all you're gonna do is you're gonna\ncreate another test account again.\n\n464\n00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.690\nYou're gonna do the exact same things and\nwhat they're really trying to move you\n\n465\n00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.155\ntowards like I said, is trying to make\nsure that this, that you set up right\n\n466\n00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:35.840\nhere, can just be flipped over to an\nactual production environment without you\n\n467\n00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.580\nhaving to re-duplicate the steps again\nin an old-fashioned type of deployment\n\n468\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.100\nsituation that you and\nI have found ourselves in all the time.\n\n469\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.530\nSo that's something that\nyou want to make sure of.\n\n470\n00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:48.440\nThe other thing that we want to do is\nwe also want to take a look, of course,\n\n471\n00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.200\nthen at the initial configuration of\nthis administrative account that you and\n\n472\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.262\nI have created.\n\n473\n00:25:53.262 --> 00:25:54.980\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that, too.\n\n474\n00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.681\nSo you can see that I have\nsigned on here with my name and\n\n475\n00:25:57.681 --> 00:26:01.180\nwhen you take a look at it you'll\nsee something a little bit unusual.\n\n476\n00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:09.000\nThis one actually does say\nronald@itprotvdemo.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n477\n00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.780\nBy default,\ninside of the way that Office 365 works,\n\n478\n00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.170\nis that when you create this,\nit creates this default domain name.\n\n479\n00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:21.940\nSo this is essentially a sub-domain\nof what onmicrosoft.com, and\n\n480\n00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.980\nthis is what every single\naccount will end up with.\n\n481\n00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.650\nAnd so when it does that,\nthat's perfectly fine, but\n\n482\n00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:31.430\nthe very fact is you're probably not gonna\nwant anything like that in the future.\n\n483\n00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.090\nSo we're gonna have episodes where we talk\nabout how do we actually change that or\n\n484\n00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.730\nconfigure that to register\nour own domain name as well.\n\n485\n00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.380\nSo don't be bothered by this right away.\n\n486\n00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.080\nA lot of times if you are creating that\ntest bed environment, it's perfectly fine.\n\n487\n00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.240\nThis will work on email just as well as\nany other account will work on email.\n\n488\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.590\nYou just have a different one for\nright now in your testing environment.\n\n489\n00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.820\nBut if you don't want that to\nbe in your testing environment,\n\n490\n00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.250\nyou can configure your DNS servers\nto instead work with Office 365 and\n\n491\n00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.340\nwe'll show you how to do that, too.\n\n492\n00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.520\nNow the other thing that we wanna do is,\n\n493\n00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.500\nwe wanna take a look at how we can edit\nthat account if we need to change it.\n\n494\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.400\nSo if I click over here on this Tile\nbutton over on the left-hand corner,\n\n495\n00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.980\nand then what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna scroll down here to Admin and\n\n496\n00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.020\nyou're still seeing,\n\n497\n00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.070\nhere's other things that looks like\nit's still setting up in the background.\n\n498\n00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.540\nBut, Admin I can select on.\n\n499\n00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.880\nAnd it's right here in the Admin Center.\n\n500\n00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.430\nNow we can actually set up quite\na few different things, but\n\n501\n00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:31.820\nwe want to focus in on of course, this\ntenant administrator at the beginning.\n\n502\n00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.110\nSo, I'm gonna click on Users and\n\n503\n00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.740\nthen select Active Users\nis what we are going to do.\n\n504\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.590\nOkay?\n\n505\n00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.820\nNow, underneath here on\nthe active users at this point,\n\n506\n00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.070\nyou'll see that.there it is.\n\n507\n00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.700\nThere is that one particular account\nthat we have set up, which is for\n\n508\n00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.910\nme right here.\n\n509\n00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:51.930\nAnd, then over here on the right-hand\nside, this is where you can go in and\n\n510\n00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.670\nyou can edit that user.\n\n511\n00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.150\nSo I can reset his password,\nI can edit the users and\n\n512\n00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.750\nupdate the roles, I can edit, I can delete\nthem, I can add to a different group.\n\n513\n00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:05.860\nAnd then we can also see\ndetails here about the user and\n\n514\n00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.425\nwhat's actually subscribed them.\n\n515\n00:28:07.425 --> 00:28:11.680\nHis primary email address right now is\nthe default one that's been set up.\n\n516\n00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.840\nHe's been assigned this\nE3 enterprise license.\n\n517\n00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.730\nAnd on Office installations, if I actually\nhad my Office installations going on,\n\n518\n00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:24.060\nwe could even see that I might\nhave put Office 365 on my laptop,\n\n519\n00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.860\non my desktop computer, one at home.\n\n520\n00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.810\nIt would actually work as well.\n\n521\n00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.230\nMailbox permissions, you name it, and\n\n522\n00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:34.440\nlook at that you can even edit individual\nExchange properties and Skype for\n\n523\n00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.822\nBusiness properties per user\nif we wanted to right there.\n\n524\n00:28:38.822 --> 00:28:41.910\nSo there's a couple of different\nthings that you can do right here\n\n525\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:46.240\nas far as making sure that that\naccount is who you want it to be.\n\n526\n00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.640\nSo when you actually want\nto add in a new account,\n\n527\n00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.730\nyou simply click on the plus sign and\nyou're gonna do that.\n\n528\n00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.870\nAnd we're gonna be doing\nthat a little bit later on,\n\n529\n00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.490\nI wanna get too ahead of\nmyself at this point.\n\n530\n00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.740\n>> Really quickly, Ronnie,\nyou have the tenant accounts and\n\n531\n00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.670\nyou have the administrator accounts.\n\n532\n00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.590\n>> Are they two separate accounts or\n\n533\n00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:07.570\nis administrative privileges kind\nof tacked onto a tenant account?\n\n534\n00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.840\n>> The very first account is\ngonna be your tenant account.\n\n535\n00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.950\n>> Okay.\n>> Essentially is what's gonna end\n\n536\n00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:11.870\nup happening.\n\n537\n00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:15.370\nAnd then what they really want to do,\nbecause this particular account,\n\n538\n00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:20.610\nthey really don't want me signing in every\nday, To use it like an Office 365 user,\n\n539\n00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.720\nthey really want this to be for\n\n540\n00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.360\nadministrative purposes for\nmanaging the entire account itself.\n\n541\n00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.520\nSubscriptions, if we add in users,\nwe want to make sure that we do that.\n\n542\n00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.460\nThe problem with that is fairly simple,\nis that we might do that, but\n\n543\n00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.280\nwe don't tend to do it every day.\n\n544\n00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.930\nSo what ends up happening is that,\nin about three weeks from now or maybe for\n\n545\n00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.750\nme about three hours from now,\nI'm gonna forget what that password is and\n\n546\n00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:45.320\nwhen I do that,\nthen I won't be able to login.\n\n547\n00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.620\nSo the recommendation right here is\nthat you go ahead and you start creating\n\n548\n00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.130\ndelegated administrators right\nhere at the very beginning.\n\n549\n00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.419\nYou add in additional users and\nthen you go, all right,\n\n550\n00:29:54.419 --> 00:29:56.720\nhere's who's gonna be able\nto create subscriptions.\n\n551\n00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.640\nWho's gonna be able to add in\ndifferent subscriptions and when you\n\n552\n00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.130\nstart doing that, it will automatically\nemail them and tell them that hey,\n\n553\n00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:07.230\nyou actually are now included in on this\nstuff, so that you can go in and do that.\n\n554\n00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.590\nSo, if you need to make\na monumental change,\n\n555\n00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.410\nhere's the account that actually\nis the one that's in control.\n\n556\n00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:17.150\nSo, you want to make sure of course,\nthat you have that account password\n\n557\n00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:21.340\nis actually gonna be very strong, and\nyou want to make sure that if anything,\n\n558\n00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:25.370\nright, nobody loses\nthe information in that account.\n\n559\n00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.320\nI can't tell you how many times\nI've actually just created\n\n560\n00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.540\nan account with just even a company out\nthere and I've forgotten the password\n\n561\n00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.000\nright away just because I knew I wasn't\ngonna ever actually use it again.\n\n562\n00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.450\nBut the very fact is this\nis one of these accounts\n\n563\n00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.270\nthat you want to make sure that it's\nactually in control when you do that.\n\n564\n00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.000\nBut it's really about that,\nit's really making sure that you have\n\n565\n00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.550\na real first name, real last name,\na valid email account.\n\n566\n00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:50.760\nMake sure you have a strong password to\nthis as well, and then get started here.\n\n567\n00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.470\nOkay?\n\n568\n00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.600\nNow, the other things\nthat allow us to do this,\n\n569\n00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.100\nonce we create the provisioned account,\nwhich we have Is that we want to go into\n\n570\n00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.250\nManaging The Subscription area is\nwhat we want to take a look at.\n\n571\n00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.750\nAnd see some of the things that we\ncan do with the subscriptions, too.\n\n572\n00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:08.230\nSo as we take a look at that,\n\n573\n00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.710\nover here on the left-hand side you'll\nsee that the entire Admin Center, and\n\n574\n00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.480\nwe're just gonna take a look\nat a couple of things here.\n\n575\n00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.000\nSo notice that there's the User, there's\nthe Deleted Users, Partner Relationships.\n\n576\n00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.390\nIf I scroll down, I don't actually\nsee the word subscriptions here,\n\n577\n00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:28.020\nbut it's actually underneath where it says\nBilling, is what it actually says here.\n\n578\n00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.730\nAnd it's here that we can actually\ntake a look at subscriptions.\n\n579\n00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:31.230\nOops.\n\n580\n00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:35.890\nAnd this is what we\nwant to see right here.\n\n581\n00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.180\nSo now notice that you\ncan actually take a look.\n\n582\n00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.210\nAnd there it is, there's the Office trial.\n\n583\n00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:43.670\nAnd one has actually been assigned, the\nfirst one that's actually logged in, and\n\n584\n00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.860\nthere's 25 more available.\n\n585\n00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.741\nSo from this point if I wanted\nto actually add in more,\n\n586\n00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:50.800\nand more, and more as people come in.\n\n587\n00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.313\nWell notice I can buy there\nper user per month, and\n\n588\n00:31:54.313 --> 00:31:57.921\nthis one is about $20 per\nuser per month as well.\n\n589\n00:31:57.921 --> 00:32:02.590\nSo you do want to be very careful\nas you start setting things up.\n\n590\n00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.620\nYou might realize that you do have to\nchange this thing out, as well, cuz a lot\n\n591\n00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:11.500\nof times, what ends up happening, right,\nis that you go, wow, I like this,\n\n592\n00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.990\nbut I need to change this because this was\nnot the actual subscription that I wanted.\n\n593\n00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.530\nSo, we want to make sure that\nwe talk about that, as well, and\n\n594\n00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:22.150\nmake sure that we understand that there\nare some changes that will have to go on.\n\n595\n00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.980\nBut selecting the wrong type of\nsubscription is one of the things that can\n\n596\n00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.859\nend up really driving us a little bit\nbatty, because it doesn't look like that\n\n597\n00:32:29.859 --> 00:32:32.460\nthere's a place for\nus to change this, and there are.\n\n598\n00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.220\nIt just depends on the type\nof license you have.\n\n599\n00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.120\nAs a trial user, you don't have that\nability to kind of skip around.\n\n600\n00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.680\nThey give you this one for use,\nbut if you happen to buy it,\n\n601\n00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.260\nyou'd see another button here that says\nthat you want to change your subscription,\n\n602\n00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.160\nthen you can actually change it and there\nare manual ways to do it as well, and\n\n603\n00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.170\nwe'll be getting into that too.\n\n604\n00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.980\nLet's see, any other thing here?\n\n605\n00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:51.600\nOkay.\n\n606\n00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.180\nSo once we actually have that done,\nremember again,\n\n607\n00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.700\nwe emphasize this idea of using\nthat real name as being that,\n\n608\n00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.540\nyou know,\nthat initial subscriber here, as well.\n\n609\n00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.970\nAnd once everything is confirmed,\nthen we normally go ahead and\n\n610\n00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.120\nsay all right, here it is.\n\n611\n00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:06.710\nOkay?\n\n612\n00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:07.610\nSo we're gonna pick one.\n\n613\n00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.760\nNow, doing the trial one,\nit only gave me this option.\n\n614\n00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.410\nIf you buy,\nyou'll actually be given those options,\n\n615\n00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:16.405\nof whether you want a home subscription,\nor whether you want one of the more,\n\n616\n00:33:16.405 --> 00:33:18.810\nyou know, kind of enterprise-level\nsubscriptions, as well.\n\n617\n00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.930\nFrom that point, you just choose the one,\nand this is why when you start,\n\n618\n00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:25.410\nyou want to make sure that you actually\nhave an idea of what you're heading for\n\n619\n00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.500\nat the very beginning, as well.\n\n620\n00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.160\nOkay?\n\n621\n00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.140\nSo when we take a look at this model here,\nokay, and\n\n622\n00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:35.430\nwhat we're looking at, the very fact\nis that if you have bought this,\n\n623\n00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.030\nright, you will, and it normally will have\nanother little green button there, and\n\n624\n00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.180\nyou'll actually be able to click on it and\nit'll walk you through a wizard.\n\n625\n00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.600\nBut what if you're like me and\nyou don't have that?\n\n626\n00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.070\nWell there's a manual process that\nyou need to be able to follow\n\n627\n00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.470\nif you don't have that like I do.\n\n628\n00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.350\nSo let me show you here.\n\n629\n00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:55.430\nAll right, so the manual process, and\nyou have to be able to do this, is one,\n\n630\n00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.000\nyou wanna make sure that you go in and\n\n631\n00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.580\nyou purchase the subscription\ntype that you want.\n\n632\n00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.730\nSo you have a couple of\noptions at this point.\n\n633\n00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.490\nNotice if I click Buy Now from right here.\n\n634\n00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:08.890\nLet me see if it actually\nwill let me switch over.\n\n635\n00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:10.420\nSo it looks like it's\ntaking it's sweet time.\n\n636\n00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:16.550\nYou can go ahead and actually just select\nthat subscription type right there.\n\n637\n00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.511\nOr you can go back out and\nactually say, hey,\n\n638\n00:34:18.511 --> 00:34:20.530\nI want to be able to\nchange that subscription.\n\n639\n00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.680\nAnd then to give you different buttons on\nhow you change that subscription type,\n\n640\n00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.200\nis what can end up happening, all right?\n\n641\n00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.350\nNow if you don't, right, you actually end\nup purchasing the licenses that you want,\n\n642\n00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:36.050\nand then once you verify that those\npurchases have now been bought,\n\n643\n00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.140\nat that point,\nyou would go back up to your users,\n\n644\n00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.120\nyour active users here, and\nyou select that particular user,\n\n645\n00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:50.815\nand it's here that you\ncan select edit the user.\n\n646\n00:34:53.908 --> 00:34:56.779\nAnd then, I click on licenses.\n\n647\n00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:02.540\nAnd then the license here, if I had bought\nanother one, let's say I bought the E1,\n\n648\n00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.140\nI would have that option right here.\n\n649\n00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.030\nAnd I simply uncheck this one,\nand check the E1, click save, and\n\n650\n00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.920\nwe are ready to go.\n\n651\n00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.230\nNow the hard part about this, right,\nis that now that you've done that,\n\n652\n00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:19.550\nif I've installed Office 365 on my\ncomputer, used that E3 license,\n\n653\n00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:25.610\nin all reality, what I need to do is I\nneed to uninstall it from my computer, and\n\n654\n00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:30.190\nthen log in with my E1 account, and\nactually install it from there again.\n\n655\n00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.870\nSo there's still a little\nbit of a clumpiness to it.\n\n656\n00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.799\nI don't know how, you know, it's not\nexactly the, you know, like the smooth\n\n657\n00:35:36.799 --> 00:35:40.220\nprocess where it's like, okay, now you\nhave an E3 license, now you have an E1.\n\n658\n00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.250\nIt just works.\n\n659\n00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.260\nSo a lot of times you do, in theory,\nyou're supposed to back and\n\n660\n00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.710\nuninstall the original software\nfrom whatever license you had and\n\n661\n00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:52.400\nthen install it under the new software,\nand then you'll be up and ready to go.\n\n662\n00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.980\nSo in this lesson, we did take a look at\na lot of different things having to deal\n\n663\n00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.810\nwith the very provisioning\nof the account itself.\n\n664\n00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.490\nAnd then we took a look at\njust what happens if you\n\n665\n00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:04.990\ndon't select the right account, and then,\nyou know, what else do we need to do if we\n\n666\n00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.510\ncan't change it right away,\nwhere you have to actually go back and\n\n667\n00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:10.560\nrepurchase it, uninstall it and\nthen reinstall it again.\n\n668\n00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.535\nSo there's a lot of things that\nare just right at the beginning and\n\n669\n00:36:13.535 --> 00:36:16.450\njust provisioning the account itself and\nmaking it work.\n\n670\n00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.150\n>> Definitely some excellent information,\n\n671\n00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:22.051\nsome basic understanding that we\nneed to know about Office 365 and\n\n672\n00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:26.200\njust getting into that managing\nidentities business as we move on.\n\n673\n00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.410\nThis is gonna be very,\nvery helpful information for\n\n674\n00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.100\nus as we get to those topics.\n\n675\n00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.330\nRonnie, is there anything else that\nwe need to cover in this episode?\n\n676\n00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:35.690\n>> Not really, we just need to\nremember that as we start off,\n\n677\n00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:39.760\nright, the honesty is by far the most\nimportant because if you do decide\n\n678\n00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.072\nthat you're gonna switch on over,\nright, and you made a silly,\n\n679\n00:36:43.072 --> 00:36:47.940\nyou know, mistake by being dishonest\nabout the original administrator account,\n\n680\n00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.818\nyou're not gonna want to move that\ninto some production network.\n\n681\n00:36:50.818 --> 00:36:54.110\nSo, you know, this is one of those\nsituations where they really want to try\n\n682\n00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:58.510\nand reduce the amount of work that you\ndo by making everything upfront and\n\n683\n00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.740\nhonest about what you're doing right done.\n\n684\n00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:05.180\nSo, if you have that chance and that\npotential that you are considering it,\n\n685\n00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.383\nyou're planning, you're deploying it in\nthe near future, you wanna see it, just\n\n686\n00:37:08.383 --> 00:37:12.680\nsaying, make this learning process a part\nof that production, you know, and do that.\n\n687\n00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.910\nSo, don't be dishonest,\n\n688\n00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.320\nI think it's probably the easiest\nthing to think about here.\n\n689\n00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.880\n>> All right, well Ronnie, thank you so\nmuch for that and thanks for\n\n690\n00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.850\njoining us today.\n\n691\n00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.300\nThank you out there for watching.\n\n692\n00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.940\nWe'll go ahead and sign off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n693\n00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.698\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n694\n00:37:27.698 --> 00:37:31.282\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:21.087\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're continuing down\n\n4\n00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:24.044\nthe trail of that\nMicrosoft Office 365 business.\n\n5\n00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:26.070\nAnd again, this is quite a mouthful.\n\n6\n00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.490\nThe Office 365 Identities and Requirements\nexam, available by, well, Microsoft.\n\n7\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.340\nAnd joining me yet\nagain to lend his expertise is\n\n8\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.050\non that very topic is my good friend Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.100\nRonnie, welcome back to the show,\nhow are you doing today, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.130\n>> I am doing fine.\n\n11\n00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.230\nIt's another great day as we continue\non to take look at some of the other\n\n12\n00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.250\nthings that need to be set up so\n\n13\n00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.490\nthat we can get Office 365 working for\nour own environment.\n\n14\n00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.230\nMaking sure that everything's gonna\nwork the way that we want to.\n\n15\n00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.540\nIn a previous episode, we talked\nabout the default configurations,\n\n16\n00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.700\nsetting up that basic tenant account so\n\n17\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.750\nthat we can at least get Office 365 on our\nmachines and getting it ready and working.\n\n18\n00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.112\nWe also took a look at just being able to\nmanage the subscriptions just briefly,\n\n19\n00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:12.760\nwhether or\nnot we wanted to change subscriptions.\n\n20\n00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.703\nBut, there's other things\nthat we also need do.\n\n21\n00:01:14.703 --> 00:01:19.537\nAnd one, of course, is that very important\naspect of the very fact that when we\n\n22\n00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:24.850\ncreated that basic account, you saw where\nit actually added the onmicrosoft.com.\n\n23\n00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.515\nSo, even though I might have put in\nthe name of my domain, which I did,\n\n24\n00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:33.270\nitprotvdemo, it actually added that on,\nit appended it on there.\n\n25\n00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.540\nAnd that's because by default, right,\nMicrosoft says no, you're actually gonna\n\n26\n00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.620\nbecome a tenant of onmicrosoft.com,\nso it added that in there.\n\n27\n00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.090\nAnd the problem that we have\nthere is fairly simple,\n\n28\n00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.090\nis that normally inside of my business,\n\n29\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.750\nI don't want that to actually be the name\nthat I'm gonna use with my business.\n\n30\n00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.140\nEven when I'm working with Office 365,\nI want it to be my domain and\n\n31\n00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.535\nnot necessarily on Microsoft,\nappended at the end.\n\n32\n00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:03.415\nSo that's what we need to take a look\nat in this episode as we get started.\n\n33\n00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:07.135\nSo, the very first thing when we\nstart planning out this idea that,\n\n34\n00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:10.675\nhey, I have a chance, I think I wanna\nto take a look at using Microsoft.\n\n35\n00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:13.875\nWe go ahead and we set up that account\njust like we did in a previous episode.\n\n36\n00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:18.654\nThe second thing that we also need to\ndo now is to add in a custom domain,\n\n37\n00:02:18.654 --> 00:02:23.532\nessentially saying all right,\nI want Office 365 to use my DNS name.\n\n38\n00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:26.701\nAnd that's what we have to talk\nabout right here at the beginning,\n\n39\n00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:30.438\nthe idea of actually understanding how\nDNS also works with Office 365, and\n\n40\n00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:32.310\nthen getting to work with it too.\n\n41\n00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.392\n>> Yeah, this is definitely\nsomething you're gonna wanna do.\n\n42\n00:02:34.392 --> 00:02:39.144\nBecause eventually, if Office 365 is\nthe solution for you, you're gonna\n\n43\n00:02:39.144 --> 00:02:44.370\nwanna lose that onmicrosoft.com beginning\ndomain, you don't want that part.\n\n44\n00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.633\nIf I'm running ronnieshatsforcats.com,\n\n45\n00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:51.936\nwhich is one of his best websites yet,\n[LAUGH] we make a joke.\n\n46\n00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:54.840\nThen I want that to be the domain,\nand that's where I want it to be.\n\n47\n00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.115\nSo Ronnie, this obviously is lending\nus towards the fact that we need\n\n48\n00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:02.011\nto understand a little bit of something\nwhen it comes to the domain naming system,\n\n49\n00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:04.167\nright, the DNS systems that're involved.\n\n50\n00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:06.770\nWe're gonna need to know a little\nbit about that, some basics.\n\n51\n00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.210\nSo let's begin there,\nwon't you walk us through some of that.\n\n52\n00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.490\n>> Yeah, let's go ahead and\ntake a look and\n\n53\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.130\ntalk about the idea of DNS just\nbriefly as just a simple primer.\n\n54\n00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.080\nWe're not going anywhere in depth as well,\nso don't take this as the final and\n\n55\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.210\nauthoritative word,\neverything that we're saying.\n\n56\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.561\nBut it's just a review and\n\n57\n00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:26.570\na concept of understanding the basics\nof using Domain Name System.\n\n58\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.639\nIf you are working in a shop, more than\nlikely DNS is familiar hat for you, but\n\n59\n00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.666\nif this is your first time understanding,\nlet's make sure we kind of know.\n\n60\n00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:38.500\nRemember that any time you connect to,\nwell, anything on your network and\n\n61\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.420\nusually anything across the Internet and\nyou're using a name, you're using DNS,\n\n62\n00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.890\nDomain Name System.\n\n63\n00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.810\nThat really does take what, a name that\nis human readable, something that you and\n\n64\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.710\nI can understand, and\nsomewhere on along the network,\n\n65\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.640\nsome computers out there are translating\nthat into an IP address.\n\n66\n00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.834\nSending that information back to my\ncomputer so it can connect to, well,\n\n67\n00:03:57.834 --> 00:03:59.440\na computer somewhere else, right?\n\n68\n00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.735\nSo let me show you a diagram of\nwhat we're talking about here and\n\n69\n00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:04.950\nhow that basic process ends up working.\n\n70\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.256\nSo when we take a look at this\nsimple diagram, here it is.\n\n71\n00:04:08.256 --> 00:04:12.966\nWe've got a host over here on the left\nhand side, we have here a DNS server.\n\n72\n00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:17.470\nAnd so what normally happens,\nof course then, if I open up a browser and\n\n73\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.460\nI say hey, I need to go to\nitprotvdemo.com, perfectly fine.\n\n74\n00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.599\nWhat will happen then, of course, is that\nthere will be a request sent out if my\n\n75\n00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.072\ncomputer can't resolve\nthe IP address here.\n\n76\n00:04:28.072 --> 00:04:31.440\nAnd it can't, it simply goes out and\nfinds a DNS server.\n\n77\n00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.436\nA DNS server will check its records and\n\n78\n00:04:34.436 --> 00:04:40.064\nit will look inside of those records\ntrying to find itprotvdemo.com.\n\n79\n00:04:40.064 --> 00:04:43.887\nAnd it will actually look and see that\nthere's gonna be an IP address attached to\n\n80\n00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:47.000\nthat record, and\nreturn that back to the host machine.\n\n81\n00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.010\nThen the host can connect to,\nwell, whatever that server is.\n\n82\n00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.400\nNow remember that DNS server though,\n\n83\n00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.150\nhas a lot of different record\nstored in its database.\n\n84\n00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.080\nIn DNS terms we call that database a zone.\n\n85\n00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.210\nSo there are what we call A records\nthere or address records, right.\n\n86\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.840\nThis is actually probably the most\nimportant type of record that we have\n\n87\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.190\non hand, usually, on that server.\n\n88\n00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.580\nWhich is going to keep that\nname that we talked about and\n\n89\n00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.060\nlink it to that actual\nIP address that we have.\n\n90\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.930\nPerfectly fine and\nthat's what we also want to know,\n\n91\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.421\nso that's usually the first record\nthat we tend to have to look up.\n\n92\n00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:26.253\nThere's also what we call a CNAME record,\nwhich is a canonical record.\n\n93\n00:05:26.253 --> 00:05:30.590\nAnd this is actually something that points\nto another host name record as well.\n\n94\n00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.150\nSometimes you hear the idea of\nan alias record too, where you wanted\n\n95\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.590\ntwo different names essentially\nattached to, well, that one IP address.\n\n96\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.327\nSo the way that ends up working is\nthat you can attach something like\n\n97\n00:05:43.327 --> 00:05:45.110\nftp.itprodemo.com.\n\n98\n00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.488\nAnd you can actually have it\npoint to FTP2 if you wanted to.\n\n99\n00:05:49.488 --> 00:05:51.621\nAnd then that will actually link up to,\nwell,\n\n100\n00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:54.830\nthat A record that goes to\nwhatever server that we want.\n\n101\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.123\nIf you're gonna be using email,\n\n102\n00:05:56.123 --> 00:05:59.030\nyou're gonna have an MX record\nthe point to your email service.\n\n103\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.750\nAnd this is very important, right.\n\n104\n00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.800\nThe very fact is that\nthose servers have to\n\n105\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.130\nknow what particular host is\nactually gonna respond to emails.\n\n106\n00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.370\nName servers pointing to\nthe authoritative server for\n\n107\n00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.982\ndoing DNS for a delegated domain.\n\n108\n00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:16.100\nSo if there's another domain out there for\n\n109\n00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.614\nanother domain, we want to make\nsure that we can point to that.\n\n110\n00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:22.827\nWe essentially don't resolve it,\nwe say go and ask that server.\n\n111\n00:06:22.827 --> 00:06:24.777\nWell, that's what DNS record does.\n\n112\n00:06:24.777 --> 00:06:26.357\nPTR, or point to records,\n\n113\n00:06:26.357 --> 00:06:29.467\nallow us normally to do what\nwe call reverse lookups.\n\n114\n00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:31.882\nI have an IP address but\nI need to resolve the name.\n\n115\n00:06:31.882 --> 00:06:34.599\nWell, the point to records\nallow us to do that as well.\n\n116\n00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.015\nThen there's an SPF, and\nthis one is the one I have to remember,\n\n117\n00:06:38.015 --> 00:06:39.930\nsender policy framework.\n\n118\n00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.850\nThe sender policy framework is basic,\nat the most basic,\n\n119\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.860\nan anti-spam type of record for us.\n\n120\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.190\nIt actually designates who's\nauthorized to be able to use\n\n121\n00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.330\nthe hello as well as the mail from types\nof records that we have out there.\n\n122\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.150\nAnd if you're not actually in that\nlist where that SPF is gonna be, well,\n\n123\n00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.760\nthen you actually know that too.\n\n124\n00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.770\nServices, of course, are actually\ngoing to be listed right here.\n\n125\n00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.150\nSo, servers that are doing\nthings like lookups for\n\n126\n00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.250\nnames, yes you do need a pointer to that.\n\n127\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.365\nAnd then there's text records.\n\n128\n00:07:13.365 --> 00:07:17.170\nIf we need to put in human\nreadable information in the DNS,\n\n129\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.680\nthat can actually be used to verify and\nto be able to do other things.\n\n130\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.880\nThose are the different types of\nrecords we normally find inside of DNS.\n\n131\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.580\nAnd you may wonder, well,\nokay Ronnie, why do we need that?\n\n132\n00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.920\nWell, we need those because\nthat's how DNS works.\n\n133\n00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.790\nIt's based off of these records\nthat are here inside of DNS.\n\n134\n00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.720\nMore importantly, okay,\nbecause we're talking about Office 365 and\n\n135\n00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.950\nwe're connecting to it, well,\nit also is something that Office 365 uses.\n\n136\n00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.011\nSo the reason why I wanted\nto emphasize that, right,\n\n137\n00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:48.809\nis that a lot of times as\nyou set up Office 365.\n\n138\n00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:53.614\nAnd you think everything looks like,\nI've got the email working in Office 365\n\n139\n00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:56.479\nthe way I want to,\ngot everything else working.\n\n140\n00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:58.170\nBut all of a sudden it's not connecting,\n\n141\n00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.017\nit's not connecting\nthe way you think it is.\n\n142\n00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:02.397\nOne of the first places you should check,\n\n143\n00:08:02.397 --> 00:08:05.880\nbecause this is one thing we have\nto get set up is gonna be DNS.\n\n144\n00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.980\nAnd so these records, they need to be\nthere when Office 365 is using it,\n\n145\n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.030\njust like they need to be there when we're\nusing it inside of our network as well.\n\n146\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.390\nSo we need to make sure that\nwe understand that hey,\n\n147\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:23.350\nhowever Office 365 uses it,\nwe need to have those records in our DNS\n\n148\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.890\nstructure that we have set up somewhere to\nmake sure that it uses it perfectly fine.\n\n149\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:33.430\nIt's very easy to use Office 365 and\ngo, look, I can access this.\n\n150\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.580\nI can do this.\n\n151\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.460\nBut why isn't my e-mail working correctly?\n\n152\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.460\nYou go and check and it shows that\neverything that you set up correctly,\n\n153\n00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.840\nsometimes it's as simple as\nyou're missing an MX record.\n\n154\n00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.990\nOr you actually have a canonical name and\n\n155\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.740\nit's just not working,\nwell check out those names.\n\n156\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.150\nMake sure you actually know what\nof these records might be missing.\n\n157\n00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.010\nSo if you want to learn more\ndetail about it, go ahead and\n\n158\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.070\ncheck out other episodes that we\nhave here on ITProTV about DNS.\n\n159\n00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.650\nBut overall though, just kind of realize\nthat it is based on these records and\n\n160\n00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.600\nit's records like these that's going to\nhelp us essentially to get Office 365 to\n\n161\n00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.560\nrecognize the way that we have DNS, and to\nmake sure that everything is set up right,\n\n162\n00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.400\nso that we can pull our domain over and\nuse that instead of the OnMicrosoft.com.\n\n163\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.280\n>> All right Mr. Renaldo, now that\nwe understand DNS we will at least\n\n164\n00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.020\nTo some extent we got\na nice little primer.\n\n165\n00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.830\nWe're ready,\nI can see I got my records here so\n\n166\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.110\nif there is anything wrong with\na record I can probably see that.\n\n167\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.283\nAnd we understand that Office\n365 uses these records so\n\n168\n00:09:31.283 --> 00:09:33.103\nthat I can use my own domain name.\n\n169\n00:09:33.103 --> 00:09:37.489\nAre now ready to jump into the guts of\nOffice 365 and start getting it and\n\n170\n00:09:37.489 --> 00:09:42.180\nconfiguring it to use my own domain name\nand get rid of that OnMicrosoft.com.\n\n171\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.790\nIs there anything else we need to know?\n\n172\n00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.840\n>> We need to know just a few more things\nhere, because it can be confusing.\n\n173\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.000\nIt's easy to get excited because of how\neasy it was to set up that tenant, right?\n\n174\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.860\nWe really only need to provide\na few pieces of information.\n\n175\n00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.290\nMicrosoft essentially did the rest for us.\n\n176\n00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.000\nGoing in and exploring the new\nways that we have to do things.\n\n177\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.840\nAgain, that might be a little\nbit challenging, but\n\n178\n00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.280\nlearning something new is\nalways exciting as well.\n\n179\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.630\nBut we also need to take some\nconsiderations especially\n\n180\n00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:13.230\nif we happen to be in a situation where\nwe use things like child domains and\n\n181\n00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.220\ndifferent other things that\nwe have to worry about.\n\n182\n00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.780\nSo let's say for an example that\nyou actually come from a company\n\n183\n00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.520\nthat ended up merging from two different\ncompanies and now you have multiple\n\n184\n00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.220\ndomains that you have to worry about such\nas an old domain versus a new domain.\n\n185\n00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.820\nWell, is that something that we have\nto consider if people still using\n\n186\n00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.460\nthe old domain name and\nthe new domain name?\n\n187\n00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.310\nYou better believe it.\n\n188\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.630\nAnd if you have to do something like that,\nyou have to be aware that you might have\n\n189\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.640\nto setup the same thing that we're going\nto be doing with one domain right now,\n\n190\n00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.800\nwell, for two instead so\njust kinda be aware of that.\n\n191\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.710\nWhat if you have child domains?\n\n192\n00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.910\nSo one of the ones that I like\nto use when I do shows is I\n\n193\n00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.380\nuse a generic one called lab.itpro.tv.\n\n194\n00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.880\nWell our overall domain is itpro.tv,\nbut for me, what about child domains?\n\n195\n00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.860\nWell if I'm going to be using child\ndomains, with e-mail addresses especially,\n\n196\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.570\nI need to also consider\nthe very fact that I\n\n197\n00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.435\nhave to consider what we\ncall sub-domains here too.\n\n198\n00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:13.840\nSub-domains may also be something\nwe also have do registered and\n\n199\n00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.510\nrecords for as well.\n\n200\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.670\nThe other thing of course is the number\nof domains that we need to set up.\n\n201\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.010\nNow this something we shouldn't run into,\nto an issue about.\n\n202\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.870\nBut believe it or not Daniel there is a\nlimitation to the number of domain you can\n\n203\n00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.010\nset up with office 365 so you do have\nto worry about it a little bit Daniel.\n\n204\n00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:36.450\nSo when you hit your 600 and first domain\nthat you're gonna migrate over and\n\n205\n00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.570\nget working with Office 365\nthen you're in trouble.\n\n206\n00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.370\n>> Well this is not\ngonna be a solution for\n\n207\n00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.532\nme I guess 612 domains is what I have so.\n\n208\n00:11:44.532 --> 00:11:45.110\nSorry y'all.\n\n209\n00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.830\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n210\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.380\nThat's a lot of domains.\n\n211\n00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:52.020\nIf you have 600 domains\nyou're a huge company, okay.\n\n212\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.843\nYou've got a lot of stuff going on.\n\n213\n00:11:52.843 --> 00:11:55.303\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I think they give you plenty of\n\n214\n00:11:55.303 --> 00:11:56.550\nwiggle room.\n\n215\n00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.250\n>> Yeah, so 600 is the max right now.\n\n216\n00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.040\nNow, just like what Daniel said there\nmay come a point in time, right.\n\n217\n00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.570\nWhere all the sudden you know there's\nsome government out there that says.\n\n218\n00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.810\nWe do have more than 600 domains,\nMicrosoft may go, yeah I\n\n219\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.230\nthink we can actually afford to kinda and\nlet that limit loose a little bit more for\n\n220\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.510\nthat special client until\nthat super upper echelon one.\n\n221\n00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.720\nWell, that may actually end up happening\nso, you do have to worry about us.\n\n222\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.470\nSo remember, multiple domains,\n\n223\n00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.070\nsub domains, these are things that you\nmay also have to consider setting up.\n\n224\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.460\nIf you don't, they're not gonna work,\n\n225\n00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.790\nand that's why we want to\nemphasize that as well.\n\n226\n00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.480\nAnd of course, the limitation.\n\n227\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.370\nHopefully, you're not, I would hate\nto set up 600 different domains and\n\n228\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.460\nthen realize Microsoft says sorry,\n600 is your limit.\n\n229\n00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.180\nBut I guess that could happen.\n\n230\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.920\nThe other thing we also have to worry\nabout is there is an order of things\n\n231\n00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.750\nthat you have to pay attention to.\n\n232\n00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:55.710\nIf you're going to set up domains and\nalso child domains, you need to make\n\n233\n00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:00.480\nsure you set up that root domain first,\nand then add in that child domain.\n\n234\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.040\nDon't do it in reverse order because\nI can see how this can happen.\n\n235\n00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.081\nSo Daniel, let's take for example, I sit\nthere and go, I know what I wanna to set\n\n236\n00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:11.479\nup an Office 365, I want my\nlab.itpro.tv account to be set up.\n\n237\n00:13:11.479 --> 00:13:14.576\nSo that's the one I start off with\nmaking that provision for, and\n\n238\n00:13:14.576 --> 00:13:18.620\nthen later on Don says, hey,\nwhy don't we set this up for ITProTV?\n\n239\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.068\nNow I'm in trouble, right?\n\n240\n00:13:20.068 --> 00:13:23.240\nIs that is actually the root domain,\nand I've already set it up for\n\n241\n00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.680\nthe child domain.\n\n242\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.890\nSo that may cause some problems if\nyou're going to do this correctly,\n\n243\n00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.370\nmake sure you always set up\nthe root domain first, itpro.tv,\n\n244\n00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.910\nand then if you do have child\ndomains that you are using.\n\n245\n00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:40.050\nLab, ITProTV or development ITProTV,\nor whatever it might be.\n\n246\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.580\nThat's when we actually have to\nworry about the precedent and\n\n247\n00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.260\nthe order there as well.\n\n248\n00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.890\n>> Kind of putting the cart before\nthe horse there right, Ronny?\n\n249\n00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:50.300\n>> It really does and that's something\nthat they do want you to be aware of,\n\n250\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.610\nbut I can see why I\nwould do it by accident.\n\n251\n00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.260\nIt's because I am, I don't intend to\nactually have to work with the domain,\n\n252\n00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.190\nwith our production domain but\nI do use my own little domain.\n\n253\n00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.810\nRight?\nThat lab.itprotv and I go,\n\n254\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:07.500\nyou know that's who I should start up my\nbasic tenant and my trial account with.\n\n255\n00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.480\nAnd the way that Microsoft\nworks is that they really do,\n\n256\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.610\nthey want you not to have\nto worry about doing that.\n\n257\n00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.450\nThey wanna of course do this for\nyou entire organization.\n\n258\n00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.000\nSo instead,\nthat's what they would want you to do.\n\n259\n00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000\nSo as you are setting up your DNS,\nif you know that there's a possibility and\n\n260\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.240\na chance that the entire\norganization is gonna come along,\n\n261\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.120\nthey want you to set up\nthat root domain first.\n\n262\n00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.280\nIt's not difficult, but there are a couple\nof steps that we have to pay attention to\n\n263\n00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:38.340\nand then you can add in a child one a\nlittle bit later on as you do this, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.710\nThe other thing that we actually have to\nworry about as well, okay and I wanna make\n\n265\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:48.760\nsure I get this right here, is where\nare your DNS records gonna be hosted?\n\n266\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.590\nMost businesses and organizations that\nhave any type of internet presence.\n\n267\n00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.780\nThey're gonna have some DNS\nregistrar that they go through.\n\n268\n00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:00.800\nWhether it's GoDaddy, ours is Hover.com,\nwhoever it is, right?\n\n269\n00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.610\nSo that your public records\nare actually gonna be out there\n\n270\n00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.570\nto resolve names like itPro.tv.\n\n271\n00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.520\nThey're the ones that actually\nhanding that address out.\n\n272\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.100\nOkay.\n\n273\n00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:15.720\nSo you have that out there, okay, and\nof course we also have internal DNS\n\n274\n00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.120\nhosting as well but we're really\nworried about the public one, right?\n\n275\n00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.023\nAs people are actually gaining access to\nemail from the outside of our network,\n\n276\n00:15:23.023 --> 00:15:26.063\nfrom the inside of our network,\ngoing to websites and stuff.\n\n277\n00:15:26.063 --> 00:15:28.229\nWe have to have those DNS records there.\n\n278\n00:15:28.229 --> 00:15:32.480\nOffice 365 also has to be\nable to use that as well.\n\n279\n00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.810\nSo in two instances here,\n\n280\n00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:40.380\nif you are actually using kinda the small\nbusiness plan, the small business one.\n\n281\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.873\nWell, Office 365 says look, don't,\n\n282\n00:15:42.873 --> 00:15:46.837\nif you're not actually hosting\na website and doing all that stuff.\n\n283\n00:15:46.837 --> 00:15:51.858\nDon't worry about actually setting up\nyour own or needing to actually to go\n\n284\n00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:57.211\nto a DNS provider and doing what you need\nto, to create that DNS hosting for you.\n\n285\n00:15:57.211 --> 00:16:00.562\nInstead, you can use office 365.\n\n286\n00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:03.200\nIf it's a very small business,\nthey'll host if for you, and\n\n287\n00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.420\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n288\n00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.390\nBut if you're hosting your own website and\nyou've already got your own DNS hosting\n\n289\n00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.900\nprovider, you're gonna actually\nhost the records for Office 365.\n\n290\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:18.120\nSo, this where it actually\nis incumbent upon us,\n\n291\n00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.240\nright, as we're setting this up To figure\nout what context that we're in, okay.\n\n292\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.110\nSo, if I know that I'm probably\ngoing to be using like the mid-size\n\n293\n00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.540\nbusiness account or\nthe E3 account and above, right.\n\n294\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.620\nThat means I need to take the Office 365\nDNS records that they tell me to and\n\n295\n00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.380\nput them on my DNS server\nwhere I'm gonna host it.\n\n296\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.450\nIf I'm using the small business one right?\n\n297\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.640\nOffice 365 says let me handle it,\nlet them go ahead and do so and\n\n298\n00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.880\nthat way you don't have to worry about it.\n\n299\n00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.140\nYou want clear line of\ndelineation of that in your mind\n\n300\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.510\nwhen you actually set this up.\n\n301\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.660\nNot only for that, there is a chance\nyou may also see an exam question or\n\n302\n00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.960\ntwo on something like this because\nit's easy to get confused, right?\n\n303\n00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.080\nSo, the way that Microsoft does\nit is based on the account type.\n\n304\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.360\nSmall business lower,\nlet Office 365 handle your DNS and\n\n305\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.746\nessentially own those records.\n\n306\n00:17:13.746 --> 00:17:18.230\nThe mid-size business and\n\n307\n00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:22.720\ngoing up that point in the enterprise\nlevels You tend to actually have your\n\n308\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.360\nDNS registrar and you're gonna\nhost Office 365 records on that.\n\n309\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:34.330\nSo know that, I don't know how else I\ncan emphasize that any more but that is\n\n310\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.940\nactually a very clear dilenation that we\nwanna make sure that we do push there too.\n\n311\n00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.440\nNow the problem with doing that as well.\n\n312\n00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.590\nIs that DNS hosting providers,\ndepending on the DNS hosting provider.\n\n313\n00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.600\nSome of them, of course,\nwill give you a lot of access.\n\n314\n00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.970\nSome of them may not give you any access.\n\n315\n00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.620\nAnd this is something you also\nhave to worry about, too.\n\n316\n00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.800\nA lot of times,\njust getting it working, okay, is fine,\n\n317\n00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.380\nif you have access to the DNS console.\n\n318\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.030\nOkay.\n\n319\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.670\nSo, if you go to GoDaddy,\nif you go to Hover, if you go to whatever\n\n320\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.500\nthat's out there, a lot of times those\nthings, they will normally go ahead and\n\n321\n00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:13.240\ngive you access that you can add your own\nrecords in manually if you need to, and\n\n322\n00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.010\nthat's what you wanna be able to do.\n\n323\n00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:19.800\nBut what if you happen\nto have some not one\n\n324\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.810\nof those real prominent DNS hosting ones?\n\n325\n00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.870\nThat when you go there and it says, oh for\n\n326\n00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.890\nyou to be able to manipulate these\nrecords you must submit a form.\n\n327\n00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.510\nWell, you need to submit a form then and\nget those records on there.\n\n328\n00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.030\nNormally, what is the best\nrecommendation right,\n\n329\n00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.220\nespecially at this level if\nyou're gonna be doing this.\n\n330\n00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.110\nYou might have to change them frequently,\nis that yes,\n\n331\n00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.320\nyou'd switch maybe a hosting provider.\n\n332\n00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.840\nNow, if your company is locked in this\none, you just submit it the way that that\n\n333\n00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.960\nhosting provider says for\nyou to submit those changes that you need.\n\n334\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.750\nAnd then that's gonna add in a little bit\nmore time, but they should go to confirm\n\n335\n00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.670\nthat for you and get those things\nchanged over when you need to.\n\n336\n00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.500\nSo, either submit the letter or\n\n337\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.900\nyou might have to change whatever\nyour hosting provider is.\n\n338\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.350\nit's something that we\nshould be willing to do.\n\n339\n00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.440\nSo, unlike in the days when I first kind\nof started, and then heck even at my\n\n340\n00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:15.020\ndad's age you kind of had this loyalty to\nthe service here because of the people.\n\n341\n00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.180\nYou and I don't know these companies, so\nthe idea of needing to be super loyal to\n\n342\n00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.550\none particular name brand as far\nas something like that goes.\n\n343\n00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.300\nMaybe not so much so, because it's\nfairly easy for you to change that,\n\n344\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.410\ngo to another one, probably within a day\nyou're up and running, and you're good.\n\n345\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.330\nSo, I would consider changing if\nthey don't give you access, or\n\n346\n00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.210\nthey tell you you can't change,\nto make Office 365 work.\n\n347\n00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.820\nWell, that's a pretty big\nkind of game breaker,\n\n348\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.300\nif your entire company is saying we want\nto go to Office 365 And that means that\n\n349\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.450\nall of your changes are bottle-necking,\nwhere at the DNF provider saying, yeah\n\n350\n00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:51.880\nwe'll make those changes but we only make\nthem on a monthly basis or weekly basis.\n\n351\n00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.600\nYour like, wait a minute,\nno I need it today, and\n\n352\n00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.970\nthey cant make that change for you.\n\n353\n00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.710\nHopefully you won't run into that,\nbut it is possible so\n\n354\n00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.780\njust kinda be aware that you\nmay want to be able to do that.\n\n355\n00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.560\nThe other thing of course is\nWhat if you really don't care?\n\n356\n00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.800\nWell, don't register at all.\n\n357\n00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.280\nOkay.\nLeave the defaults.\n\n358\n00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.290\nYou can still use email.\n\n359\n00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:12.360\nIt won't actually get attached\nto your own domain's email.\n\n360\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.170\nYou actually have\na separate email account.\n\n361\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.410\nThat will work perfectly fine too.\n\n362\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.500\nAnd so when you do something like that.\n\n363\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.810\nIt will work as well, and\nyou don't have to worry.\n\n364\n00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.980\nNow, I believe in our chatroom\nwe actually have a question here\n\n365\n00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.510\nthat talks about the priority for\nthe email servers.\n\n366\n00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.480\nYou don't have to worry about that.\n\n367\n00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.680\nThe way that Office 365 works once\nyou actually put that in there,\n\n368\n00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.510\nright, you just decide on whether you're\ngonna use your on-premise mail provider or\n\n369\n00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.150\nyou're gonna use Office 365.\n\n370\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:41.050\nAnd that comes into that point, it depends\non which one you want to use which one you\n\n371\n00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.710\nassign the,\nI think the lower priority if I remember.\n\n372\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.080\nSo, that's the one that always gets me,\nI can't remember what the actual priority,\n\n373\n00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.260\nit's low one that's actually the one\nthat has the hot priority or\n\n374\n00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.540\nis it the higher one?\n\n375\n00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.470\nAll those numbers always confuse me but,\n\n376\n00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.400\nyes it just depends on where you\nwant to actually set that one up to.\n\n377\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.430\nSo, just kinda be aware that you know,\n\n378\n00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:01.480\nyou'll be able to make that decision,\nyou have on premise email servers,\n\n379\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.940\nyou set that Record up to actually\ndo that priority instead.\n\n380\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.630\nIf you want to actually use\nMicrosoft on Office 365,\n\n381\n00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.300\nset the MS record for Office 365, and\n\n382\n00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.800\ngive it the priority that will actually\noverride the one that's on premise.\n\n383\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.370\nYou'll be off and ready to go.\n\n384\n00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.470\nThose are records that\ncould also be done there.\n\n385\n00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.100\nI was talking about the not registering.\n\n386\n00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.240\nSo, if you don't really care,\ndon't register.\n\n387\n00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.060\nThat may be a consideration, right.\n\n388\n00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.140\nThat you don't want anybody\nswitching over right now.\n\n389\n00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.670\nBut you still want it done at some point,\nand\n\n390\n00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.550\nyou may go, I'm just going to hold off on\ndoing all this until I feel comfortable,\n\n391\n00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:36.800\nand then we'll switch\neverybody over at one time.\n\n392\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.550\nPerfectly time.\n\n393\n00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.220\nYou can do that too.\n\n394\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.150\nOne other thing that I want to make sure,\n\n395\n00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:45.840\na couple of other things as well, not\nchanging any records and not registering.\n\n396\n00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.670\nSame idea.\n\n397\n00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.300\nRight.\nIf you're not going to actually register\n\n398\n00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.930\nanything in the public, don't worry about\nit if you're not changing anything on\n\n399\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.750\nMicrosoft, it'll work just fine\nas well but it won't connect in.\n\n400\n00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.960\nAnd then lastly,\nyou gotta worry about timing, right.\n\n401\n00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.010\nDNS service providers are different.\n\n402\n00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:04.620\nSo, in theory, a lot of times,\nwe make changes on the public side,\n\n403\n00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.080\nwe know it can take up to 48 hours,\nsometimes it can take up to 72 hours.\n\n404\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.330\nSometimes it doesn't take that\nlong at all, and you can try and\n\n405\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.200\nmanipulate that a little bit by changing\nthe TTL times on those records, so\n\n406\n00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.270\nnormally if you set it to an hour,\nthat may rush things a bit, but\n\n407\n00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.840\nit may cause more traffic\nthan you really want as well,\n\n408\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.050\nso you gotta be careful on\nsetting stuff like that too.\n\n409\n00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.870\nBut just kinda realize\nyou can actually do that.\n\n410\n00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.370\nBut it may take a bit of time before\neverything kinda switches over.\n\n411\n00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.230\nSo normally you don't wanna do that\nduring the business day if you can.\n\n412\n00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.180\nBut a lot of times, you gotta realize\nthat if you're doing this on production\n\n413\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.080\nnetworks, you need to make sure that\neverybody understands that you may\n\n414\n00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.890\nhave some Issues especially if you're\ngoing to be transitioning over.\n\n415\n00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.640\nThey may kinda get a little wacky there\nuntil everything kinda even's out\n\n416\n00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.330\nafter those 72 hours.\n\n417\n00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.690\nSo, all those record that we talked about,\nright?\n\n418\n00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:58.010\nThat we're talking on all the ways\nwe have to be able to do it\n\n419\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.810\nwe've gotta make considerations especially\nwhen moving a production network over.\n\n420\n00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.770\n>> Now, Ronnie when we're\ntalking about hosting DNS right.\n\n421\n00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:09.380\nWe've got Office 365 over here maybe we've\ngot our DNS, Being hosted over there,\n\n422\n00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.755\nit's been my experience when you start to\nput the chocolate into the peanut butter\n\n423\n00:23:13.755 --> 00:23:17.920\n[LAUGH] there can sometimes\nbe issues with that process.\n\n424\n00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.750\nIs there any pit falls or\nissues that we need to look out for\n\n425\n00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:25.720\nwhen it comes to integrating opestry\n65 with a hosted DMS Well, yes, okay.\n\n426\n00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.484\nThe biggest and\nthe foremost issue are fat fingers.\n\n427\n00:23:29.484 --> 00:23:31.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean that's.\n\n428\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.890\nI hate to say it, and\nDaniel you know my typing ability.\n\n429\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:35.720\nIt is insane.\n\n430\n00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.040\n>> It's heralded far wide.\n\n431\n00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.610\nIt is amazingly bad.\n\n432\n00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.390\n>> It is, and so typos are amazingly bad,\nand you're going to see.\n\n433\n00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.900\nLike we're going to create records.\n\n434\n00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.280\nThat actually prove that\nwe own a DNS name, okay,\n\n435\n00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.900\nis what we're going to do in\nthe next few minutes here.\n\n436\n00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.110\nThat prove that we own the DNS here but\nit does require a lot of number typing.\n\n437\n00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:56.118\nSo, I got to be very\ncareful when I do this.\n\n438\n00:23:56.118 --> 00:23:57.637\nSo, we'll end up seeing that.\n\n439\n00:23:57.637 --> 00:24:02.750\nBut typos are usually kind of the biggest\none That we really have to worry about,\n\n440\n00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.810\nreplication delays again, or also\nthe other one, is not giving enough time.\n\n441\n00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:12.190\nIn other words, my impatience and\nbeing on a show like what we're doing,\n\n442\n00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.940\nit does, it tends to get to me\nmore than it probably should.\n\n443\n00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.870\nI just need to kind of\nlet it sit out there and\n\n444\n00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.340\nyou know, let it takes it's time and\ndo it's thing here.\n\n445\n00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.800\nBut sometimes it does take a little bit\nof time before everything actually does\n\n446\n00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.280\nmatch right on in.\n\n447\n00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.970\nBut usually those are kind\nof the two big issues\n\n448\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.720\nthat we tend to see when we do this.\n\n449\n00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.400\nOkay.\n\n450\n00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.660\nSo that's what we have to do.\n\n451\n00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.570\nSo that's where we are going to pick\nup is we're going to show you now how\n\n452\n00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.520\ndo we take those initial steps.\n\n453\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.010\nBecause I do have my own hosted DNS,\nlike what Daniel was mentioning.\n\n454\n00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:49.340\nThe very fact is, I wanna now take my\nOffice365 account that I just recently\n\n455\n00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.260\nmade and I want to begin to actually\nmake that integration happen so\n\n456\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:59.260\nI can use the ITPROTVdemo.com domain and\n\n457\n00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.960\nso the on Microsoft domain to get started.\n\n458\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.180\nSo let's go ahead and do that as well.\n\n459\n00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.610\nNow I've got one more thing I need\nto show you before I do that.\n\n460\n00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:09.410\nI just realized.\n\n461\n00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.270\nLet me take a look at\nanother drawing here,\n\n462\n00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.270\ncuz this can get a little\nconfusing if we don't.\n\n463\n00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.797\nSo this is a set up that is what\nis called a split brain DNS, and\n\n464\n00:25:17.797 --> 00:25:20.230\nmost organizations are doing this.\n\n465\n00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.960\nIf you have a hosted provider\nout there on the internet\n\n466\n00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.090\nthat's handling your external DNS.\n\n467\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.280\nYou have your own internal\nDNS servers inside.\n\n468\n00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.280\nThis is what actually tends to happen for\nus to resolve a name, right.\n\n469\n00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.240\nSo what do we want?\n\n470\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.570\nInside my network,\nI wanna use private IP addresses.\n\n471\n00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:40.220\nMakes sense, but how do people on\nthe outside network get connected into,\n\n472\n00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.500\nwell, things like that?\n\n473\n00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.820\nSuch as a web server.\n\n474\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.520\nWell so I have a web server\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n475\n00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.920\nAnd I have two IP\naddresses attached to them.\n\n476\n00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.030\nWell, which IP address goes where?\n\n477\n00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:55.970\nWhat I want is the ability that when\nsomebody types in www.itprotvdemo.com\n\n478\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:01.620\nfrom internally on my network,\nI want it to resolve to 172.16.12.200.\n\n479\n00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.820\nMake sense.\n\n480\n00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.670\nBut if you're outside of the network,\nover here on the right hand side,\n\n481\n00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.770\nand somebody goes in and\ntypes this in as well.\n\n482\n00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:13.720\nWell I want that DNS provider\nto actually resolve to this\n\n483\n00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.160\npublic IP address that I set up\ninstead for that public provider.\n\n484\n00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.300\nSo not so much that it's really\nabout one machine, right?\n\n485\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.840\nIs about making sure that if\nthey're on one side of the network\n\n486\n00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.850\nthey get one address,\n\n487\n00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.560\nif they're on the other side of the\nnetwork they get a different address okay?\n\n488\n00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.800\nIf you're gonna set this up so\nthat Office 365 works in this situation,\n\n489\n00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.750\nyou're gonna need to create those\nrecords on both the internal server\n\n490\n00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.880\nas well as where on\nthe external records too.\n\n491\n00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:45.820\nSo that again is another kind of stickler,\nright, for those of you that are preparing\n\n492\n00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.670\nfor an exam, that you may get a question\nor two on something like this,\n\n493\n00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.470\nlike where is it actually appropriate\nto do something like this.\n\n494\n00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:57.430\nYou got to kind of be aware that\nsometimes, and we were talking about this,\n\n495\n00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.930\nit's not so\nmuch that it's an Office 365 issue,\n\n496\n00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.950\nthis just an issue that\nthe way DNS records work.\n\n497\n00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:08.400\nBut I want Office 365 to work so that\nwhen people connect in from the outside,\n\n498\n00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.100\nDaniel's checking his email cuz he's out\nin Tennessee, it's going to hit here,\n\n499\n00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.100\nand then he still needs to\npoint in Office 365, right.\n\n500\n00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.970\nWhen he's internal on the inside working\non the network, he wants to go and\n\n501\n00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.940\ncheck his email,\nit still needs to point that way,\n\n502\n00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.550\nbut he needs to do it from\nthe internal DNS servers too.\n\n503\n00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.160\nAnd that's why you need to set him\nup on both if you're gonna do this.\n\n504\n00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.840\nSo just kind of be aware, all right?\n\n505\n00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.160\nNow let's go ahead and set this up.\n\n506\n00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.570\nI talked way long, but-\n>> That's right,\n\n507\n00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.430\nwe're waiting with bated breath.\n\n508\n00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.320\n>> I know.\n>> We want to see it.\n\n509\n00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.740\n>> We'll see how we do here.\n\n510\n00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.330\nOkay?\n\n511\n00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:37.890\nSo here it is.\n\n512\n00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.180\nWe're gonna go back to the admin.\n\n513\n00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.750\nNow if you don't remember that, on Office\n365 you click on this little button here,\n\n514\n00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.400\nthe tiles button, then click on admin and\n\n515\n00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.480\nthat will bring you to\nthe Office 365 admin center.\n\n516\n00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.300\nAnd if I want to be able to use this, I\nneed to scroll down here on the left hand\n\n517\n00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.410\nside in this navigation tree\nto where it says Domains.\n\n518\n00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:03.010\nAnd then once I get in Domains,\nyou see the default DNS or\n\n519\n00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.578\nthe default domain that it\nsets up right here, okay?\n\n520\n00:28:05.578 --> 00:28:08.930\nWhich is itprotvdemo.onmicrosoft.com,\n\n521\n00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.110\nthis is the one that's set\nup inside of Microsoft.\n\n522\n00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:14.540\nNotice that if you have everything set\nup and you actually are doing this,\n\n523\n00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.500\nyou can buy your own domain from Microsoft\nif you're not doing a trial account.\n\n524\n00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.040\nIf you're doing a trial\naccount it's like hey,\n\n525\n00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.580\nswitch on over to a paid account, and\nthen you can purchase a domain but\n\n526\n00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.010\nit won't let you actually purchase\none from the trial account.\n\n527\n00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.060\nBut if you happen to have your\nown ready like what we do,\n\n528\n00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.070\nI just need to simply add a domain.\n\n529\n00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.860\nAnd so I'll click here and\n\n530\n00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.480\nI will add this domain and now we have\nthese three steps that we need to follow.\n\n531\n00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.270\nStep number one is that it had to\nverify that I actually own that domain.\n\n532\n00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.230\nIf not, Daniel can simply go,\nno, that's my domain and\n\n533\n00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.210\ngo ahead and take that from me and\nI would never know.\n\n534\n00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.790\nAdd users and then set the domain up.\n\n535\n00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.580\nSo I'm gonna follow the link at\nthe bottom that says getting started, and\n\n536\n00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.140\nwhen I do it's gonna ask\nme what's my domain.\n\n537\n00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:04.420\nIt's gonna be itprotvdemo.com,\nand then I'm gonna click next.\n\n538\n00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.233\nAnd now, it's getting the information,\n\n539\n00:29:06.233 --> 00:29:08.810\nit's going out there and\nit's actually taking a look at it.\n\n540\n00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.800\nAnd you can see a couple of different\nways that this actually works for us.\n\n541\n00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.840\nOnly the domain owner\ncan update DNS records.\n\n542\n00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.450\nSo, what are they're asking me to do?\nThey're asking me to go ahead and\n\n543\n00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.800\nadd this text record in here.\n\n544\n00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.850\nSo, to make sure that it can verify.\n\n545\n00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.070\nSo the way that Office 365 works here,\n\n546\n00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:32.050\nis that I add this record\ninto my hover account.\n\n547\n00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:36.810\nAnd then, once I've got that, it can then\ntalk and verify that that record's there.\n\n548\n00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.530\nAnd then we'll be ready to go.\n\n549\n00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.550\nSo the way I do that is\nI go over to my hover.\n\n550\n00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.490\nLet me see if it actually lets me copy,\nthough.\n\n551\n00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.320\nI don't know if it will\nlet me copy everything.\n\n552\n00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:44.820\nI'll try.\n\n553\n00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.770\nGo to my hover, and here it is.\n\n554\n00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:51.490\nHere is my DNS register record and\n\n555\n00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.410\nthere's all of the different records\nthat I have that's been set up for me.\n\n556\n00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.980\nI simply add a new record,\nand on this host name,\n\n557\n00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.720\nI don't know if it'll let me\npaste it in the way I want it to.\n\n558\n00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.600\nPasted the whole thing in so, let me just\npaste in a little bit at a time here.\n\n559\n00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.460\nSo I know that that's the @ and this\nrecord type is going to be a text type.\n\n560\n00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:15.880\nAnd then I need this value, I think.\n\n561\n00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.590\nYep, that's the value.\n\n562\n00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.210\nAnd this should be exact.\n\n563\n00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.840\nIs what this value should be.\n\n564\n00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.460\n>> Just ruling out the human\nerror equation, aren't you?\n\n565\n00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.740\n>> Yeah, I'm trying to, but\nwe'll see if that actually works or\n\n566\n00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.580\nnot, make sure that I don't do that.\n\n567\n00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.270\nNow, the one thing that mine doesn't give\nme is the ability to change the ttl,\n\n568\n00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.210\nthe time to live, so\n\n569\n00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:43.750\nthat may take a little bit longer and\nI think I'm gonna click save.\n\n570\n00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:45.810\nAnd let's see what happens.\n\n571\n00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:50.410\nAnd when I scroll down I see\nthis last record added in.\n\n572\n00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.910\nNow, you can actually do a TXT record or\n\n573\n00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:59.150\nan MX record that actually depends on\nyour hosted domain provider as well, so\n\n574\n00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.930\none of them may actually accept one and\nnot the other.\n\n575\n00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.760\nUsually they accept both.\n\n576\n00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.850\nBut you only need one or the other.\n\n577\n00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.180\nYou don't actually need to\nadd both of them in there.\n\n578\n00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.690\nSo that's all we need to\nadd in from that point.\n\n579\n00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:12.035\nAnd then I go back to that, and\n\n580\n00:31:12.035 --> 00:31:15.100\nonce I've added the record,\nI follow the instructions through,\n\n581\n00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.590\nand there it goes you can see at\nthe bottom it says it's verified it.\n\n582\n00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:23.379\nWe verified that you actually\nown itprotvdemo.com.\n\n583\n00:31:23.379 --> 00:31:27.940\nSo I am gonna click next and\nnow it's gonna ask me,\n\n584\n00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.490\nselect the users you want to be able\nto update and use this instead.\n\n585\n00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.120\nSo I want, essentially, all my users and\n\n586\n00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.310\nI just created another one\nright before the show here.\n\n587\n00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:40.840\nSo instead of actually using that, and you\nsee where it says it's going to update it\n\n588\n00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:48.400\nto itprotv.com, instead of on Microsoft,\nand I now update the selected users.\n\n589\n00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.350\nAnd there it is.\n\n590\n00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.462\nSo now, it's fairly easy right?\n\n591\n00:31:51.462 --> 00:31:56.509\nI've gotten rid of that default domain,\nnow all of my DNS is actually\n\n592\n00:31:56.509 --> 00:32:00.960\ngoing to be registered through\nmy Hover And click Next here.\n\n593\n00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.110\nSo there it is,\nI've signed out of the account.\n\n594\n00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.985\nNow it says for\nme to close out the browser and\n\n595\n00:32:05.985 --> 00:32:10.042\nlet's see if I can actually sign back in,\nis what I need to do.\n\n596\n00:32:10.042 --> 00:32:14.190\nGo back to this portal and\nlet's verify, there it is.\n\n597\n00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:18.010\nSo it actually did sign me out,\nbut I'm now using my last pass and\n\n598\n00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.920\nit is Ronald@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n599\n00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.418\nAnd if I go back and\ncheck on the admin page here.\n\n600\n00:32:29.459 --> 00:32:31.460\nAnd I go back to domains.\n\n601\n00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.530\nAnd you can see that it's\ntaking a bit of time for\n\n602\n00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:41.220\nit to resolve and finish up and\nit says I need to complete the setup.\n\n603\n00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:45.400\nSo now it's asking me do I\nwanna add in other users?\n\n604\n00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:50.800\nI can continue to add in another user if I\nwant to, and I'm gonna skip this process.\n\n605\n00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.610\nAnd cuz I'm actually at step\nnumber 3 which is what I need here\n\n606\n00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.750\nis the other DNS records.\n\n607\n00:32:55.750 --> 00:33:00.090\nSo if I click Next, here,\n\n608\n00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:04.190\nit says do I wanna to transfer\nDNS management in the next step.\n\n609\n00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.080\nNo, I have an existing website or\nI prefer to manage my own.\n\n610\n00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.670\nThis is we're actually make that decision\nbased on whether using that small business\n\n611\n00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:15.930\naccount, whether using the midsize\nenterprise account as well, okay.\n\n612\n00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:21.280\nSo I'm going to leave it as is for\nright now cuz I'm using the Enterprise 3.\n\n613\n00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.220\nAnd then I'm gonna click Next.\n\n614\n00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.570\nAnd it says here this is\nwhat we also have to do.\n\n615\n00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.650\nThis is where we also decide on\nwhat we call the domain purpose.\n\n616\n00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:31.010\nNow, what is this about?\n\n617\n00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:35.630\nWell remember that because this is about\nDNS The very fact is if I choose less\n\n618\n00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:39.550\nof these options, it's going to\ncreate less records for me, okay?\n\n619\n00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.270\nAnd those records will also\njust have to be added back into\n\n620\n00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.300\nhover is what will have to happen here.\n\n621\n00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:49.105\nIf I choose more, well then it will\nactually create more records for me.\n\n622\n00:33:49.105 --> 00:33:51.005\nSo can I come back and\nchange this later on?\n\n623\n00:33:51.005 --> 00:33:52.285\nYes.\nYou can come back in and\n\n624\n00:33:52.285 --> 00:33:53.365\nchange this later on.\n\n625\n00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:56.445\nYou can go look, I really only want\nto do it for the email, calendar and\n\n626\n00:33:56.445 --> 00:33:59.755\ncontacts, but not for Skype for\nBusiness or instant messaging.\n\n627\n00:33:59.755 --> 00:34:01.385\nWell then you don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n628\n00:34:01.385 --> 00:34:03.185\nBut I can select all of them for\nright now.\n\n629\n00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.840\nAnd it actually has this.\n\n630\n00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.720\nAnd there's even the idea\nof SharePoint online.\n\n631\n00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.740\nAnd so they're actually saying that's\nactually going to be a special\n\n632\n00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.270\nprocess instead.\n\n633\n00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.220\nSo we are going to click Next here.\n\n634\n00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.070\nAnd in a moment you'll see,\n\n635\n00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:23.340\nhere are the other records it really\nwants me then to go back in and add in.\n\n636\n00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.360\nThere's the MX records that\nit wants me to add in, and\n\n637\n00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.360\nhere are the C name records,\nthe canonical names\n\n638\n00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:35.160\nthat are pointing to these other host\nname records that are out there.\n\n639\n00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.830\nHere is another one for\nthat SPF value that we talked about.\n\n640\n00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:43.420\nHere's one for sip and sipfederations too,\nso they're services and so\n\n641\n00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:48.600\nonce you add all those records back in,\nyour account is gonna take a few\n\n642\n00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.330\nmore moments or even a little bit of time\nsay 72 hours to add everything back in.\n\n643\n00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.290\nAnd from that point, you can verify and\n\n644\n00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:01.050\neverything should be done and ready for\nyou to use all those extra services.\n\n645\n00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:02.070\nSo it's the same edition.\n\n646\n00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.260\nYou don't need to see me cut and\n\n647\n00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:08.640\npaste all these records back\ninto my DNS host provider.\n\n648\n00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.680\nBut that's what well essentially happen,\nis that we'll finish that configuration\n\n649\n00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.490\nand then in the end it will verify\nthat everything is up and ready to go.\n\n650\n00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:20.010\nAnd that means that because I actually\nset it up for the Outlook and for\n\n651\n00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:25.080\nthe Skype for Business, and anything else\nthat I think I chose something else here\n\n652\n00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.390\nthat will actually get all\nthose records ready for\n\n653\n00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:30.410\neverything that we actually\nneed to get ready for.\n\n654\n00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:34.820\nSo it's very important that we do\nunderstand that that is what is going to\n\n655\n00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.640\nhappen, is that it really does take\na moment for us to be able to do that, and\n\n656\n00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.480\nonce that's actually done,\nnow we can actually configure\n\n657\n00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:48.500\nthe rest of Office 365 to get\nall those other services up and\n\n658\n00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:52.390\ngoing and now ready for\nus to connect right in.\n\n659\n00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:55.670\nSo those records, they're just gonna\ngo into our DNS hosting provider and\n\n660\n00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.340\nwe're off and we're ready to go.\n\n661\n00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.940\n>> Ronnie, great job of walking us\nthrough what could potentially be\n\n662\n00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.750\na very confusing piece\nof the puzzle right?\n\n663\n00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.110\nWe want to get these two\nthings working together and\n\n664\n00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.420\nnow we know what we need to know\nabout DNS and now we have seen\n\n665\n00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:13.580\nwhat we need to configure inside of Office\n365 to make those things work together.\n\n666\n00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.710\nThank you so much, is there anything else\nthat we need to know as far as this goes?\n\n667\n00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.460\n>> Not for DNS.\n\n668\n00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.960\nDon't get me wrong,\nthere is many more complexities to DNS and\n\n669\n00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.840\nit may come back where you\nhave to tweak them but\n\n670\n00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.000\nremember you can always go back and\nthen change them if you need to.\n\n671\n00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.160\nBut it is kinda key, right, that at\nleast get that initial step on the way\n\n672\n00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.890\nif we wanna use our own\ncustom domain to get started.\n\n673\n00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:36.490\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n674\n00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.870\nWell, thank you so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n675\n00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.750\nThank you so much for watching.\n\n676\n00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.520\nThat's as far as the episode goes,\nwe're gonna ahead and close her down and\n\n677\n00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.410\ncall it a day.\n\n678\n00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:47.340\nSigning off for

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.350\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.260\nwe're continuing on with our series\non managing Office 365 identities and\n\n5\n00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.700\nrequirements and I'm so\nglad I actually got that out in one shot.\n\n6\n00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.950\nAnd joining me to help me with this and\nto help you as well\n\n7\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.760\nis none other than our good friend and\ncolleague, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.130\nRonnie, how's it going today sir?\n\n9\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.470\n>> It's going well today.\n\n10\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.210\nIt's another great day to be\nright here as we take a look at,\n\n11\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.620\nwell again migrating towards Office 365.\n\n12\n00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.940\nCompanies are beginning to do this and\nif your company isn't doing it,\n\n13\n00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.820\nyou might see that it might be\nin the future very quickly, but\n\n14\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.550\nthere's a lot of things that have to go\ninto it before we can just jump onboard\n\n15\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.892\nand say this is right for\nevery organization.\n\n16\n00:00:55.892 --> 00:01:01.010\nAnd so one of the things that we want to\ntalk about here is what we call creating\n\n17\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.349\na pilot,\nis what we're actually talking about.\n\n18\n00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:08.350\nNow, in the past, for most organizations,\nif we were to just say,\n\n19\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.790\nhey, here's a new piece of software\nwe believe that all of our\n\n20\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.570\nusers really are going to need, the way\nthat we would do it is fairly simple.\n\n21\n00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.850\nWe would create a test bed\nenvironment essentially and\n\n22\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.090\nwhen we did something like that, we would\nactually say, all right, let me go and\n\n23\n00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.880\nhand out the software or\nput them on the users' machines, and\n\n24\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.300\nlet them kind of play around with it and\nsee how they like the software.\n\n25\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.740\nFrom that particular point on, there's two\nthings that would have happened, right?\n\n26\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.820\nOne, if you're actually a fairly\nconscientious person and\n\n27\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.720\nyou kinda remember that you're\nactually in the middle of doing this\n\n28\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.400\ntesting with the software,\n\n29\n00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.270\nyou of course would give them a little\nbit of time to get familiar with it and\n\n30\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.720\nthen you would ask them questions and\nsay hey, how do you like the software?\n\n31\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.940\nHow's it working for\nyou and this and that?\n\n32\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.410\nYou might even have a questionnaire\nthat you'd fill out and then of course,\n\n33\n00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.510\nget that information back,\nto see whether or\n\n34\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.040\nnot it was something that might\nbe useful for the organization.\n\n35\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.660\nSo, when you did find that out,\nat that point, right,\n\n36\n00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.730\nonce people got used to it, then you\nmight actually do a little bit more,\n\n37\n00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.330\nyou might say hey, let's try this for\nthis whole one department and\n\n38\n00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.090\nthen when the whole one department\nactually got it, then you started saying,\n\n39\n00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.900\nall right, now we know this can be ready\nto roll out for the entire organization.\n\n40\n00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.995\nThat sounds great,\n\n41\n00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:23.045\nexcept you didn't actually have the chance\nto roll it out all at one time, right?\n\n42\n00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:25.495\nSo, even though you rolled it out to one\ndepartment, let's say you have five or\n\n43\n00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:27.115\nsix departments.\n\n44\n00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:30.765\nSo that your entire IT department could\nactually handle it and still do all\n\n45\n00:02:30.765 --> 00:02:34.595\nthe work, you might actually choose what,\none department that you roll it out to\n\n46\n00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:39.630\none week, or maybe one a month, and\nthen by the end of the year, there it is,\n\n47\n00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.060\nyou finally rolled out the software so\nthat everybody had it on their machines,\n\n48\n00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.970\nand then during this time as being rolled\nout, you're now having to troubleshoot,\n\n49\n00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.370\nyou're having to support end users, and\nsaying what the actual issues are and\n\n50\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.990\nall of a sudden,\nyou realize that you need another server.\n\n51\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.710\nAll of a sudden, you realize that\nyou need to actually have more.\n\n52\n00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.290\nAll of a sudden you'd realize that hey,\nwe don't have enough licenses and\n\n53\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.050\nthen from that point on,\nthat would be what you would end up doing.\n\n54\n00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.010\nSo anywhere software deployment could\ntake anywhere let's say between the week,\n\n55\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.440\nmaybe all the way up to\nmonths if not an entire year\n\n56\n00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.470\nbefore your organization was\nreally ready to go to it.\n\n57\n00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.160\nAnd a lot of times, because people were\nactually on that kind of unusual curve,\n\n58\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.880\nthat lag time,\n\n59\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.160\nyou would still be supporting users that\nwould still be trying to get used to it at\n\n60\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.220\nthe end of the year, while other users\nare now actually fairly experts at it, and\n\n61\n00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.270\nnow you're actually having to deal with\nthis entire range of support issues.\n\n62\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.050\nWell, Office 365 says, let's do things a\nlittle bit different than the traditional\n\n63\n00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.520\nsoftware deployment and that's what we\ncall the idea here of trying to make\n\n64\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.519\nwhat we call a pilot type of roll out\nis what we're talking about here.\n\n65\n00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.125\n>> Yes, now, I've heard of\npeople doing it the way Ronnie\n\n66\n00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:54.095\njust described it that traditional method,\nI'm more of a fan of the wide sweeping\n\n67\n00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:56.735\nchanges across the board and\nthen taking a month off for vacation.\n\n68\n00:03:56.735 --> 00:04:02.315\nAnd apparently that's not correct but\nthat's all right,\n\n69\n00:04:02.315 --> 00:04:05.885\nand it's not and I'm having a good time\nhere, it's not that's not the right way to\n\n70\n00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:09.440\ndo it what Ronnie said that is\nexactly how normally software changes,\n\n71\n00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.760\nor wide-sweeping changes\nof any kind are done.\n\n72\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.930\nYou have a test bed,\nyou make sure everything works,\n\n73\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.590\nthen you get some users to start playing\nit and see how they work with it,\n\n74\n00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.770\nfind the bugs, work them out,\nand then continue on and you\n\n75\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.370\ngradually work your way into it becoming\nyour production environment, right?\n\n76\n00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.400\nWell with Office 365, Ronnie, you\nmentioned that pilot, let's start there.\n\n77\n00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.152\nWhat exactly is a pilot when\nwe talk about Office 365?\n\n78\n00:04:32.152 --> 00:04:35.700\n>> Right, unlike a traditional test\nbed environment where we may set up\n\n79\n00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.570\nan entirely, complete different\ninfrastructure just about, to make sure\n\n80\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.060\nthat we can do everything that we want to\nand then at the end of that entire test,\n\n81\n00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.340\nwe might find out and say we're gonna give\nit three months to actually run through\n\n82\n00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.380\nand then we decide that we're going to go\nahead and now push it out to everyone.\n\n83\n00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.670\nWell, the problem with that is simple.\n\n84\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.610\nNow that you've set up an entirely\ndifferent environment so it wouldn't\n\n85\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.260\naffect your production network, well now\nyou do what you tear down everything.\n\n86\n00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.025\nYou just tear it down and\nyou go all right, so\n\n87\n00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:03.955\nnow you start discussing how do we\nimplement this inside of our business and\n\n88\n00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:05.655\npush it out the way that we talked about.\n\n89\n00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:08.025\nWell, that's where all of\na sudden the work begins,\n\n90\n00:05:08.025 --> 00:05:11.275\nright, is that you started off with a\nlittle bit of work just doing a test bed,\n\n91\n00:05:11.275 --> 00:05:14.675\nand now you're actually recreating\nthat test bed, but for your production\n\n92\n00:05:14.675 --> 00:05:17.145\nenvironment to make sure that your\nproduction environment doesn't go down,\n\n93\n00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:19.580\nand that you can deploy\nthe software at the same time.\n\n94\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.990\nIt becomes very much a critical and\na very unusual time\n\n95\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.500\nbecause there are things you're gonna\ntry that may absolutely confuse you or\n\n96\n00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.440\njust totally not work in your production\nenvironment in the same way it did in\n\n97\n00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.580\nthe test bed environment instead.\n\n98\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.100\nWell, the way that Office 365 says\nthis is the idea of the pilot.\n\n99\n00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.260\nNow when you think about that word and\nthat idea, the term pilot is what,\n\n100\n00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.220\nis that you're actually doing the stuff\nthat you're talking about and\n\n101\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.270\nyou're just essentially\nadding in a smaller group.\n\n102\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.260\nIn other words, you're really doing\nall the stuff that you would do to get\n\n103\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.950\nthat particular software rolled\nout in the way that you want to\n\n104\n00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.850\nas you're actually doing\nthe testing environment and so\n\n105\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.890\nthe way that Office 365 says it is\nin three different steps here, okay.\n\n106\n00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.010\nThey talk about going ahead and planning\nout your pilot and then when you actually\n\n107\n00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.940\nget everything ready and set up,\nthen at that point, you can deploy it.\n\n108\n00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.900\nYou might deploy it at the very beginning\nto a few users to test it out here, but\n\n109\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.800\nthe deployment phase is actually almost\nidentical to what you actually do in\n\n110\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.930\nthe pilot anyways, and\nthen once everything is out and\n\n111\n00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.940\nrunning, then you enhance it.\n\n112\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.780\nIn other words,\n\n113\n00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.470\nyou might actually add in for Daniel's\nsake here, he might actually be able to\n\n114\n00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.290\nhave a different level of support than\nwhat well a user like me might have.\n\n115\n00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.650\nHe might actually be able to have more\nsoftware on hand that I would have.\n\n116\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.630\nIn other words, we can enhance it and\nactually make it customized\n\n117\n00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.040\neven to the individual without changing\nthe stuff that we set up at the beginning\n\n118\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.450\njust to test out whether or\nnot we're going to roll that out or not.\n\n119\n00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.420\nSo planning out a pilot for Office 365\nis one of the more important things that\n\n120\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.430\nyou can do if you are considering\ndeploying Office 365 in your environment.\n\n121\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.350\nSo there are several things that we\nneed to do as we start preparing for\n\n122\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.095\nactually creating a Pilot\ninside of our organization.\n\n123\n00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:11.675\nSo, the good thing is we've really done\nthis in a couple of other episodes\n\n124\n00:07:11.675 --> 00:07:14.675\nwhere we talked about\nthis idea just briefly.\n\n125\n00:07:14.675 --> 00:07:18.660\nThe very fact is that, of course,\nit begins with you signing up for\n\n126\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.880\nlet's say for example,\na trial of Office 365.\n\n127\n00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.972\nThat's kind of the big thing at the\nbeginning here is that they go ahead and\n\n128\n00:07:25.972 --> 00:07:30.526\nthey'd say what, look, we're not actually\nsaying that this is a test or a demo,\n\n129\n00:07:30.526 --> 00:07:34.948\nwhat we're saying is we're gonna go ahead\nand allow you to create an account and\n\n130\n00:07:34.948 --> 00:07:39.238\nthat tenant account that you need to and\nthat tenant account then can actually\n\n131\n00:07:39.238 --> 00:07:43.330\nbe used during that demo period that\nyou want or during that trial period so\n\n132\n00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.471\nthat you can test it out what you want.\n\n133\n00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:50.317\nBut then that trial account can become\nnow your actual production account in\n\n134\n00:07:50.317 --> 00:07:55.011\nthe future and you're not gonna have\nto tear down anything and that's why\n\n135\n00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:59.931\nit's very important that as we set it up\nat the beginning That we be honest that\n\n136\n00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:04.775\nwe actually have everything set up and\nnot go, oh I'm gonna do Donald Duck,\n\n137\n00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:09.280\nDaffy or whoever it actually is gonna\nbe as the actual administrator.\n\n138\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.130\nThey really want a contact that absolutely\ncan handle what's gonna be there.\n\n139\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.160\nSo getting that set up is one of\nthe first things that we might do.\n\n140\n00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.380\nNow when we start talking about\nimplementing a pilot though there\n\n141\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.614\nare several steps that\nwe need to go through.\n\n142\n00:08:22.614 --> 00:08:27.516\nAnd one of those early steps,\nof course is just trying to make sure that\n\n143\n00:08:27.516 --> 00:08:33.040\nour organization is going to be ready for\na testing environment.\n\n144\n00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.060\nThe reason why this is important is\nbecause of two different things.\n\n145\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.934\nIf your organization is brand new,\nlet's say that you just started\n\n146\n00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:46.906\na business in the past year and\nyou've hooked them to Office 365.\n\n147\n00:08:46.906 --> 00:08:49.407\nAnd you start out,\neverything is perfectly fine,\n\n148\n00:08:49.407 --> 00:08:51.630\neverything you do is through Office 365.\n\n149\n00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.900\nIt's become native for you, nothing is\nreally kind of out of the ordinary.\n\n150\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.100\nBut normally,\nmost people are actually migrating to it\n\n151\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.350\nfrom the older way that you and\nI used to do a lot of things, right?\n\n152\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.630\nWe might already have email\nstarted on our network.\n\n153\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.490\nAnd now it's like well,\nwhen we move to a new email server,\n\n154\n00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.780\nwhat has to be done when\nyou start doing stuff?\n\n155\n00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.480\nWell, that's actually a consideration\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n156\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.640\nWhat about existing software\non our computer networks?\n\n157\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.120\nWhat about our network itself,\n\n158\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.760\ncan it actually handle the additional\ntraffic to Office 365 from all of our\n\n159\n00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.620\nusers if we're going to be doing things\nlike this, and even other things, right.\n\n160\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.540\nWhat about my existing\nActive Directory that I have?\n\n161\n00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.020\nThere's a lot of considerations,\nand whether or\n\n162\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.060\nnot our network is ready to handle it.\n\n163\n00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.000\nSome of the things that we need\nto do is what we call, of course,\n\n164\n00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.640\ndoing readiness checks.\n\n165\n00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.170\nSo when we start planning for\n\n166\n00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:46.400\nan Office 365 environment,\nwe may want to start off right there.\n\n167\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.390\nIs saying,\nwhat do I actually need to do to make sure\n\n168\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.670\nthat this pilot is gonna\nwork the way it should.\n\n169\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.250\nAnd if you think about it, it really\nis preparing you for that production.\n\n170\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.640\nIn other words, if you can actually get\nthese checks ready during our pilot,\n\n171\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.520\nwe're doing it for 5, 6 ,7% of our\nentirety of our users as we do this.\n\n172\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.180\nThen we have this opportunity,\nnow that that's actually done,\n\n173\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.630\nthat it's gonna work for the rest of the\n95% or 98% or so of the users I have that\n\n174\n00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.930\nwe're actually going to push\nout the rest of Office 365 to.\n\n175\n00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.570\nSo it's very important that\nwe actually do plan, and\n\n176\n00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.910\ndo take a look at the way that we do\nsome readiness checks to make it work.\n\n177\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.780\n>> Yeah Ronnie, I'm a big fan of this\nmodel that Microsoft has adopted for\n\n178\n00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.600\ndeploying Office 365 here, because\nanybody that has every been a part of\n\n179\n00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.560\nany kind of upgrade or migration or\nneeded a test environment.\n\n180\n00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.010\nA couple things tend to happen.\n\n181\n00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.680\nOne is you go to the system,\nright, everything works perfectly.\n\n182\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.960\nIt's amazing, you buy the product, and\nthen you go to implement it into your\n\n183\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.800\nproduction environment, and\nit's like why isn't this working?\n\n184\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.930\nThis worked perfectly in our test\nenvironment, why is this now not working?\n\n185\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.970\nAnd then you have to figure out what's\nwrong and go through it all over again,\n\n186\n00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.180\nhave a bunch of headaches,\npull your hair out,\n\n187\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.400\nbite your nails off, and it's a nightmare.\n\n188\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.610\nRight, that's not fun.\n\n189\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.830\nAnd two, why go through it again?\n\n190\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:07.000\nThat whole option of, if this is gonna\nwork we just wanna turn the switch on.\n\n191\n00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.540\nWe just wanna be in place so\ndoing the work doubly,\n\n192\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.050\neven if does go smoothly,\nis really a bit of a waste of time.\n\n193\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.383\nSo Microsoft is saying,\nlet's just go ahead we'll integrate\n\n194\n00:11:18.383 --> 00:11:21.989\nthis in to your network in\nat least a certain extent.\n\n195\n00:11:21.989 --> 00:11:25.829\nSo that when you're ready you just\nturn on, you just go ahead and say man\n\n196\n00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:29.991\neverything is set up I donâ€™t have to do\nit twice which is obviously awesome and\n\n197\n00:11:29.991 --> 00:11:31.030\nit's ready to go.\n\n198\n00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.920\nI don't have to try to figure it out any\nquirks or hiccups or anything like that.\n\n199\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.960\nTurn the switch, I'm off to the races.\n\n200\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.425\nNow Ronnie you talked about giving\nthe environment ready that even before\n\n201\n00:11:41.425 --> 00:11:45.040\nwe start implementing 365\nwith some readiness checks.\n\n202\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.060\nTell us about those, what's some of the\nreadiness checks we need to go through?\n\n203\n00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.100\n>> All right, so when we take a look\nat the idea of readiness checks,\n\n204\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.630\nremember that there's a few things that\nI did mention right at the beginning.\n\n205\n00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.490\nOne, we need to make sure, of course,\nthat our network is ready.\n\n206\n00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.740\nIn other words, remember that because\neverything is a cloud service,\n\n207\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.310\nthat means all of your users, let's say\nthat we're actually all in one building.\n\n208\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:08.380\nNow I know that Daniel used to work in\na gigantic building here in Florida.\n\n209\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.590\nAnd let's say he had thousands of users.\n\n210\n00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.980\nWell, the connection, of course,\nto the Internet was probably a big,\n\n211\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.240\nwide pipe that he had\nconnected to the Internet.\n\n212\n00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.880\nBut now if you increase the traffic, let's\nsay by 60, 70%, is that gonna be enough?\n\n213\n00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.640\nSomething like that.\n\n214\n00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.450\nYou do have to make sure that your network\nis actually ready to handle the extra\n\n215\n00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.100\ntraffic that it makes, so that everybody\ncan actually get connected in.\n\n216\n00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.890\nIf they're using the Office 365 products,\nwe need to make sure there's enough\n\n217\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.430\nreadiness and\nbandwidth there to ensure that, hey, look.\n\n218\n00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.790\nHere is what's gonna end up happening\nif we do something like this.\n\n219\n00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:41.980\nSo those are some of the checks.\n\n220\n00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.720\nThe other thing of course, are what\nabout the users that actually are gonna\n\n221\n00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.360\nbe installing Office 365 on their\nmachines inside of my network as well?\n\n222\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.234\nWell, is my network as far as\nthe individual machines ready for\n\n223\n00:12:54.234 --> 00:12:56.656\nthat Office 365 deployment there?\n\n224\n00:12:56.656 --> 00:13:00.661\nRemember that this is no longer Daniel\nsaying I'm in control of the deployments,\n\n225\n00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:02.239\nI have built the perfect image.\n\n226\n00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:04.810\nYou're not gonna touch to my image,\nyou're not gonna do that.\n\n227\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:10.229\nOffice 365 will actually give every\nindividual user that ability to be sitting\n\n228\n00:13:10.229 --> 00:13:15.175\nat their workstation and say, we'll\ngonna go ahead and install the newest\n\n229\n00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:20.530\noffice 2016 or Office 2013,\nwhatever version it actually is up there.\n\n230\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.451\nAnd I think it's Office 2016,\nit's a latest one that's up there and\n\n231\n00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:28.246\nthat's kind of a neat feature too,\nis that Office 365 will always be\n\n232\n00:13:28.246 --> 00:13:31.489\nthe latest edition for\nyou as you pay for that subscription.\n\n233\n00:13:31.489 --> 00:13:34.195\nBut they'll actually be\nable to install that and\n\n234\n00:13:34.195 --> 00:13:37.364\ndirectly from their work\nstations right then and there.\n\n235\n00:13:37.364 --> 00:13:42.018\nSo that means Daniel doesn't have to go\nall right who's gonna be available this\n\n236\n00:13:42.018 --> 00:13:45.769\nweek inside of my department that\ncan help the marketing team get\n\n237\n00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:49.000\nall of these machines installed and\nverified at.\n\n238\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.359\nThat they're activated and\n\n239\n00:13:50.359 --> 00:13:53.365\nmake sure that they're actually\nworking that they need to be.\n\n240\n00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:59.540\nThat they're connected to the right\nserver for them to save everything to.\n\n241\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.940\nWell, in Office 365,\nit's automatically done through that user.\n\n242\n00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.630\nSo every single user has\nthat chance to login.\n\n243\n00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.920\nAnd when they do,\nthey'll be able to install that as well.\n\n244\n00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.808\nSo their machines also need to be ready\nspace-wise, other things that have to be\n\n245\n00:14:12.808 --> 00:14:15.907\nthere, is there previous Office\ninstallations, you name it.\n\n246\n00:14:15.907 --> 00:14:18.840\nThere's some different readiness checks\nthere that we have to worry about.\n\n247\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.710\nAnd if you do have previous email,\n\n248\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.140\nyou also have to think about\nthe idea of Exchange as well.\n\n249\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.870\nSo let's go on and take a look\nat the way that we can do this.\n\n250\n00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.650\nNow, can you go out on the Internet and\n\n251\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.600\nfind pre-requisites for\nOffice 365 in your network environment?\n\n252\n00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.830\nYou better believe it,\nof course you can do that.\n\n253\n00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.190\nOnce you actually do all that,\nyou still have to actually do what?\n\n254\n00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.310\nThose checks.\n\n255\n00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.946\nYou have to do them manually, but\nthe good thing is Office 365 says what?\n\n256\n00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:44.323\nThat's not the way to do it, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:44.323 --> 00:14:46.650\nThe way to do it is fairly simple.\n\n258\n00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:51.240\nIf you have the Office 365 as your pilot,\nthis is what you should begin to do.\n\n259\n00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.270\nSo let's start off with taking a look at\nour environment and what we would have.\n\n260\n00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.525\nSo here on my machine,\n\n261\n00:14:55.525 --> 00:15:00.220\nwe'll start off with the individual\nworkstation is what we'll do.\n\n262\n00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:05.420\nSo here in this environment, I'm running\nWindows 10 on this workstation, and\n\n263\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:11.920\nas a user I would simply log in to\nmy Office 365 account right then.\n\n264\n00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.590\nIt doesn't have to be\nthe user's workstation.\n\n265\n00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.990\nIt can be, but\n\n266\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:23.700\nit's just somebody who has administrative\nprivileges in Office 365 that you need.\n\n267\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.750\nAt this point, inside of my IT department,\nthat's what I would do.\n\n268\n00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.240\nI would assign that person,\n\n269\n00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.800\nsaying that what we need to do\nis a readiness check right now.\n\n270\n00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.930\nThis can normally be a sample right?\n\n271\n00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.371\nIf you know such as Daniel I'm assuming\nthat you all purchased work stations that\n\n272\n00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:39.281\nwere essentially the same model.\n\n273\n00:15:39.281 --> 00:15:41.231\nWell you have 50, 100,\n\n274\n00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:46.360\n200 users using that same workstation\nmodel, pick one, pick two.\n\n275\n00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.508\nThat's probably what you actually need,\nand\n\n276\n00:15:48.508 --> 00:15:51.095\nyou need to verify the readiness\nof machines like that,\n\n277\n00:15:51.095 --> 00:15:55.185\nif they're all configured or have the same\nspecifications, then you're ready to go.\n\n278\n00:15:55.185 --> 00:15:58.881\nSo the way that we do that from\nright here, in Office 365,\n\n279\n00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:01.135\nlet me zoom in just a little bit here.\n\n280\n00:16:01.135 --> 00:16:03.516\nAnd that way we can see a little bit more.\n\n281\n00:16:03.516 --> 00:16:07.264\nOh, actually once I zoomed in,\nI got rid of my little button so\n\n282\n00:16:07.264 --> 00:16:09.150\nthat doesn't work out for us.\n\n283\n00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.950\nThere we go I need that button back.\n\n284\n00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.590\nSo I'm gonna click over here on\nthis button and then go to admin.\n\n285\n00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.932\nAnd inside of my administrator console for\n\n286\n00:16:17.932 --> 00:16:22.690\nOffice 365 if I scroll down\non the left hand side,\n\n287\n00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.950\nthere is a link right above where\nit has admin where it says Tools.\n\n288\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.080\nSo it's actually the next to\nthe last link on the left hand side.\n\n289\n00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.190\nAnd when I click on Tools,\n\n290\n00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.790\nit will give me these particular\ntools that are actually available.\n\n291\n00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.940\nNow some of them are actually\ngonna be in beta.\n\n292\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.620\nAnd that's always gonna be\nhappening with Office 365.\n\n293\n00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.120\nWhy?\n\n294\n00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.010\nBecause they're constantly trying\nto improve those tools and\n\n295\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.820\nmake them as useful as they can be, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.400\nSo when you take a look like right here,\none of the first tools that it says is,\n\n297\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.450\nchecked your Office 365\nconfiguration with Office 365 help.\n\n298\n00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:00.520\nReadiness and connectivity checks is what\nit actually gives you the ability to do.\n\n299\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:06.210\nNow, if I go ahead and select that link\nit's actually gonna lean me to a place,\n\n300\n00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.640\nat least I think it is,\nunless it kinda petered out here.\n\n301\n00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.510\nThere it goes, it just takes a moment.\n\n302\n00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.730\nIt's gonna lead me to a place\nthat's online and there it is.\n\n303\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:19.790\nIt says now, we'll take a look\nat your setup how you're set up,\n\n304\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.490\nand check for settings that might\ncause problems in Office 365.\n\n305\n00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.180\nOur results will identify possible issues,\n\n306\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.730\nsuggest changes you can make to have\nthe best experience with Office 365.\n\n307\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.080\nSo I know that's a little\nbit harder to see,\n\n308\n00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.300\nlet me see if that actually\nlooks a little bit better.\n\n309\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.330\nThere we go, that makes it a little\nbit easier for us to read here.\n\n310\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.120\nSo that's what we should do,\nnow I have the quick, and\n\n311\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.810\nI have the advanced is what\nactually it gives us to do.\n\n312\n00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:45.640\nAnd notice the advanced.\n\n313\n00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.890\nIt says, if you're really\nparanoid about this, right?\n\n314\n00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.070\nDetailed check can take\nup to an hour long,\n\n315\n00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.770\nincluding check for enterprise scenarios,\nsuch as directory synchronization.\n\n316\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.590\nSo this thing can lead everything around\n\n317\n00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.020\nif you're really trying to make sure\nthat everything is ready to go.\n\n318\n00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:06.660\nBut notice the default one as I zoom in or\nzoom back out here,\n\n319\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.820\nit's actually the quick check is\nthe one that we're gonna do right now.\n\n320\n00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.450\nSo it does give us that feature.\n\n321\n00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.330\nI simply click next here.\n\n322\n00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.920\nAnd now in a moment as it's\nactually doing everything,\n\n323\n00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.160\nit says it'll just be a minute while\nwe get everything ready to roam.\n\n324\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.000\nSo the good thing is you and\nI don't really have to do much.\n\n325\n00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.960\nWe just need to make sure that we pay\nattention here to the checks that we have,\n\n326\n00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.080\nand then we begin to run these\nparticular checks here, too.\n\n327\n00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.440\n>> This is like a fire and\nforget kind of thing, right, Ronnie?\n\n328\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.070\n>> It is to a point, right?\n\n329\n00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.800\nBut let me show you.\n\n330\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.410\nI went ahead and made this list cuz I was\ntrying to think of how I can do this to\n\n331\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.560\nmake sure, right?\n\n332\n00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.450\nHere's the limitations of Office\n365 as you're doing this.\n\n333\n00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.600\nIf you gonna use that\nreadiness check tool,\n\n334\n00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.020\nyou have to be running a window's machine.\n\n335\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.760\nNow, I'm on a MAC and\nI'm still using Office 365 it works, but\n\n336\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.440\nwhat they're saying is,\nif you're doing this for\n\n337\n00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.010\nyour environment more than likely\nit's gonna be a Windows machine.\n\n338\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.370\nSo just make sure you're on Windows 7 or\n\n339\n00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.230\nlater as pretty much what\nyou're gonna see there.\n\n340\n00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.180\nAnd also be ready that if that\nreadiness check runs through,\n\n341\n00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:08.180\nit says look here is a component that you\nneed to install for me to run the check.\n\n342\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.270\nMake sure it can run that check,\nthat's gonna be important too.\n\n343\n00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.360\nWhen you actually get the results there's\nactually gonna be three different results\n\n344\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.120\nthat you have,\npassed it's just informational stuff.\n\n345\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.950\nIt tells you, here's all the things you\npassed, it's just letting you know.\n\n346\n00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.250\nIt's a good thing for you to review in\ncase you're not sure what it's checking,\n\n347\n00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.920\nor you wanna make sure that hey I\nwanna make sure that this was actually\n\n348\n00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.120\npart of the pass, you can do that.\n\n349\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.710\nSometimes you also get warnings\nin these checks as well.\n\n350\n00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.230\nThe warning is not a show stopper, okay.\n\n351\n00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.580\nThe warning is saying\nlook I ran the check,\n\n352\n00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.240\nI don't know if this is going to work or\nnot.\n\n353\n00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.910\nBut I won't stop a deployment\nif this doesn't work.\n\n354\n00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.490\nSo it may actually be something that you\ngo all right, we need to check on this\n\n355\n00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:54.550\nbecause even though it says it will pass\nit by it may cause an issue later on.\n\n356\n00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.160\nAnd then of course you'll get an error and\nof course like it sounds like\n\n357\n00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.110\nerrors are the things that we\nhave to worry about the most.\n\n358\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:05.020\nErrors will actually say, all right, there\ncomes a point when we can't do anything.\n\n359\n00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:10.140\nYou need to correct this before we start\nany type of real deployment out there.\n\n360\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.600\nAnd even during the pilot, right,\n\n361\n00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.930\nif you can correct it right now\nduring the pilot it makes it what?\n\n362\n00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.090\nEasier and when you actually get\nto that point of deploying it\n\n363\n00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.520\nto everybody that you need to.\n\n364\n00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.390\n>> Those are the conversation\nstoppers then.\n\n365\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.410\n>> Yeah, it is a conversation stopper and\n\n366\n00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.140\nthat's the one that you're really\nwanting to pay attention to.\n\n367\n00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.880\nSo when it goes through it's gonna check,\nlike I said,\n\n368\n00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.820\nis there a previous Office setup and\nif your computer is running,\n\n369\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.047\nI don't know why it would be, but\nif it's running Office 97, okay?\n\n370\n00:20:35.047 --> 00:20:37.770\n[LAUGH] If you're-\n>> That's Ronnie's workstation\n\n371\n00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.490\nat home everyone, Office '97.\n\n372\n00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:43.900\n>> If you're still running Office '97\nlike I am, no, if you are, right,\n\n373\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.900\nit's gonna check and verify that that\nOffice environment is actually ready.\n\n374\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.130\nIn other words does it meet\nthose prerequisites for\n\n375\n00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.670\nwhatever the newest edition\nof Office is gonna be.\n\n376\n00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.430\nThe computer settings as well, are all\nthe settings on that computer ready?\n\n377\n00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.620\nYou might find out that there\nmaybe a group policy thing\n\n378\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.300\nthat may have turned off something or\nmay be implementing that or\n\n379\n00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.190\nblocking something that\nOffice 365 might need.\n\n380\n00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.420\nWell, that's a showstopper itself, right.\n\n381\n00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.660\nThe very fact that you now\nhave to go to someone.\n\n382\n00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.850\nSo I'm gonna have to go Daniel, is this\nparticular group policy really something\n\n383\n00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:21.450\nthat we need cuz if we wanna deploy Office\n365, it's gonna stop us from doing it.\n\n384\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.410\nWell, that's consideration that the\nsecurity or whoever actually manages group\n\n385\n00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:28.518\npolicy will have to take a look at and\nalso domain set-up.\n\n386\n00:21:28.518 --> 00:21:29.400\nIt's actually gonna check for\n\n387\n00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.428\nthose records that we created\nwhen we added the custom domain.\n\n388\n00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:38.010\nIf we're gonna be using the mail server,\nif we're gonna be\n\n389\n00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.520\nconnecting in with Office 365,\ndo we have everything else set up there?\n\n390\n00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.070\nCheck that.\nAnd\n\n391\n00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.870\nthen of course,\nthe active directory users and groups too.\n\n392\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.150\nYou'll go ahead and verify is everything\nset up in the active directory.\n\n393\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.408\nIn other words, are those users and\ngroups, are they there?\n\n394\n00:21:51.408 --> 00:21:55.454\nIf we're gonna be doing that active\ndirectory synchronization between\n\n395\n00:21:55.454 --> 00:21:59.365\nour on premises active directory as\nwell as what we actually establish\n\n396\n00:21:59.365 --> 00:22:02.908\nin Office 365 inside of Azure's\nactive directory as well.\n\n397\n00:22:02.908 --> 00:22:05.050\nWell, it's gonna do all those checks for\n\n398\n00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:10.000\nus in that organization so running that\nprerequisite check, especially if we\n\n399\n00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.380\nbelieve that we're gonna be going to it is\none of the key elements that we can do.\n\n400\n00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:14.980\nSo here it is,\n\n401\n00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.560\nhere's one of these things that we've just\ntalked about, I've kinda bypassed here.\n\n402\n00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.950\nIs that's asking me to install\nsomething else while I'm doing this so\n\n403\n00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.500\nI'm gonna go ahead and click Run.\n\n404\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:28.010\nAnd there it goes, it's actually\ninstalling that Microsoft Office\n\n405\n00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.922\n365 support assistant 3.5\nfrom that storage there.\n\n406\n00:22:31.922 --> 00:22:35.050\nSo here's one of those things\nthat we talked about that it\n\n407\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.250\nmay have to actually install other things\nbefore it can actually finish running, and\n\n408\n00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.250\nactually that download\nkeeps getting bigger.\n\n409\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.200\nI thought,\nhey it should be simple here but\n\n410\n00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.160\nit's preparing that application to be\nable to run and do what we need to.\n\n411\n00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.730\nSo while the app is actually installing,\nwe'll see that it's going through and it's\n\n412\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:57.070\ncontinuing to, again, do the checks that\nit needs to make sure as we're doing that.\n\n413\n00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.530\nSo I'm gonna let that one run for\na moment as well.\n\n414\n00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.590\nNow, we also talked\nabout another one here,\n\n415\n00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.620\nwhich is what if you\nactually do have email and\n\n416\n00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:11.390\nyou wanna migrate over to Office 365's\nemail, the exchange server over there.\n\n417\n00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.160\nYou essentially want to kind of be\nable to do something like that.\n\n418\n00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.810\nWell, you have to also be able to\nthen run that there's an exchange\n\n419\n00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.810\nreadiness check as well.\n\n420\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:25.990\nAnd you go to your exchange server and\nyou run it on that machine, okay.\n\n421\n00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:30.440\nSo here on my machine,\nI'll also have a domain controller.\n\n422\n00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.230\nNow, you normally don't install\nexchange on a domain controller.\n\n423\n00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.120\nFor our testing environment, I just built\nthe general purpose machine, and so\n\n424\n00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.090\nit's got everything on there,\nas far as I know.\n\n425\n00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.530\nSo if you are actually doing this,\nyou would go to your exchange server\n\n426\n00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.080\nlog into Office 365, and\nyou kind of go to the same place.\n\n427\n00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.190\nOh, look at that, isn't that nice?\n\n428\n00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.553\nApparently I-\n>> Just waited just long enough Ronnie.\n\n429\n00:23:52.553 --> 00:23:55.665\n>> Just long enough to be\nable to fool me there.\n\n430\n00:23:55.665 --> 00:23:59.981\nAll right, so\nthen I click on the little button,\n\n431\n00:23:59.981 --> 00:24:03.468\ngo to admin And then we go down to Tools.\n\n432\n00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.610\nAnd inside of Tools, notice this.\n\n433\n00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:14.580\nCheck on your on-premises Exchange Server\nwith Office 365 Best Practices Analyzer,\n\n434\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.320\nand this one is in a beta.\n\n435\n00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.230\nNow notice, this one may fail out, and\n\n436\n00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.980\nthe reason why it may is that it\nsays it requires Exchange 2013.\n\n437\n00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.220\nSo most people are probably running that\nif they're doing this in their area.\n\n438\n00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.327\nAnd it's actually gonna make me\nadd all this stuff in here too.\n\n439\n00:24:30.327 --> 00:24:33.113\nAll right, come on.\n\n440\n00:24:35.366 --> 00:24:37.790\nMaybe, there it goes.\n\n441\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.830\nNow this one actually is a little download\nthat I can do, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n442\n00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:41.610\ndownload this.\n\n443\n00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.991\nI don't have to.\n\n444\n00:24:47.338 --> 00:24:49.340\nAnd then I'm gonna run it.\n\n445\n00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.542\nSo, we're simply gonna\ncheck this one out as well.\n\n446\n00:24:51.542 --> 00:24:53.682\nNotice that it's actually\ngiving me that same thing.\n\n447\n00:24:53.682 --> 00:24:56.721\nAnd I'm gonna accept everything\nthat it's telling me and\n\n448\n00:24:56.721 --> 00:25:00.517\nthere it is, the Azure Active Directory\nModel for Windows PowerShell.\n\n449\n00:25:00.517 --> 00:25:03.110\nAnd it's gonna download all that stuff and\n\n450\n00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.820\nstart analyzing\nthe Exchange Sever as well, okay?\n\n451\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.250\nSo, usually for most environments,\n\n452\n00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:14.260\nthat's probably gonna be the big one that\nyou end up running, are those two, right?\n\n453\n00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.590\nFor all the machines that we're\ngonna be using Office 365 on for\n\n454\n00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.492\nan Active Directory environment.\n\n455\n00:25:19.492 --> 00:25:23.290\nWe wanna make sure that we run them on\nthose individual models that we have.\n\n456\n00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.870\nSo if we're upgrading machines,\nright, and we're hosting two or\n\n457\n00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.210\nthree different models, we wanna make\nsure that we go to those different models\n\n458\n00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.630\nto make sure that they're running.\n\n459\n00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.480\nIf we're running Exchange, we wanna make\nsure that we go to our Exchange Server and\n\n460\n00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.880\nalso be able to run this test.\n\n461\n00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.730\nNow this is actually installing some\nprerequisites and doing some other things.\n\n462\n00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:45.118\nSo notice that, like mine here,\nit absolutely says, look, I can't do it,\n\n463\n00:25:45.118 --> 00:25:47.635\nbecause this feature cannot be installed.\n\n464\n00:25:47.635 --> 00:25:48.940\nAnd you might be wondering,\n\n465\n00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:53.822\nwhy can it not actually be installed\nhere at this particular point as well?\n\n466\n00:25:53.822 --> 00:26:00.901\nAnd that's because I'm actually running\nthat latest Server 2016 Technical Preview.\n\n467\n00:26:00.901 --> 00:26:04.067\nAnd there's also one other thing\nI think is gonna fail on here,\n\n468\n00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:06.418\nwhich I should have\nnoticed at the beginning.\n\n469\n00:26:06.418 --> 00:26:09.800\nBut notice,\nit says it requires Exchange 2013.\n\n470\n00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.660\nAnd I also went ahead and installed\nthe latest Exchange 2016 as well.\n\n471\n00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.390\nBut it's giving you that notion, right,\n\n472\n00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.180\nthat it's gonna run through the checks,\nand it should give us the same thing.\n\n473\n00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.437\nIt's either gonnagive us, of course,\nthe errors, the warnings, or\n\n474\n00:26:22.437 --> 00:26:24.800\nit's gonna say hey, everything is good.\n\n475\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.310\nSo that's the same thing,\nit's gonna run through and let us know.\n\n476\n00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:32.278\n>> So Ronnie, if this gives you warnings\nabout Exchange and your version of Server,\n\n477\n00:26:32.278 --> 00:26:37.255\nbut you could still continue on,\nthey don't guarantee functionality, right?\n\n478\n00:26:37.255 --> 00:26:38.711\n>> Right.\n>> And then if you get warnings,\n\n479\n00:26:38.711 --> 00:26:41.766\nthat's where we talked about that\nconversation stopper, the show stopper.\n\n480\n00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:43.756\n>> The errors.\n>> You're gonna have to go back\n\n481\n00:26:43.756 --> 00:26:44.571\nat that point.\n\n482\n00:26:44.571 --> 00:26:48.680\nNow if that's the environment we're using,\nthat just might be the answer.\n\n483\n00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.968\nGoing, well we're not compatible,\n\n484\n00:26:49.968 --> 00:26:52.310\nwe're not gonna be able to\nuse Office 365 here, right?\n\n485\n00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.980\n>> That absolutely is kind of the key.\n\n486\n00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.080\nLet me show you an example back\non the work station instead.\n\n487\n00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.820\nSo here's the results, right?\n\n488\n00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.240\nWe have said that the idea of passed\nmeans everything is good, which is great.\n\n489\n00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.100\nThe idea of warnings,\nnot a complete show stopper,\n\n490\n00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.700\nI won't stop you from actually\nbeing able to deploy this.\n\n491\n00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.310\nBut notice that I have two that failed.\n\n492\n00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:14.150\nMine is, of course, in the network and\nthis one in the domain as well.\n\n493\n00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.200\nSo it can actually see where\nit actually failed, and\n\n494\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.240\nit tells me what happens here, right.\n\n495\n00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:26.013\nSo the outbound port, 5223 through TCP,\nisn't allowed in the firewall and\n\n496\n00:27:26.013 --> 00:27:32.002\nit will block the mobile push\nnotification feature in Skype Business.\n\n497\n00:27:32.002 --> 00:27:35.114\nSo, if I wanted to use Skype Business,\nthat's one thing.\n\n498\n00:27:35.114 --> 00:27:39.580\nBut what if I go, look,\nI'm not gonna use Skype Business.\n\n499\n00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.150\nWell, it may not actually be such\na feature that we have to worry about.\n\n500\n00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:46.620\nBut in the domain side here it says, We\ncouldn't find the records that let other\n\n501\n00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:52.560\ndomains on the Internet know where to\ndeliver email for itprotvdemo.com.\n\n502\n00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.470\nYou have to create that specific entry so\nthat emails can be delivered there.\n\n503\n00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.670\nNow I did set up this Exchange Server,\nbut it's actually only internal.\n\n504\n00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.289\nI didn't set it up for\na connection out to the Internet,\n\n505\n00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:05.590\nand that's what it's\nalso complaining about.\n\n506\n00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:08.739\nIt's like, if you want to\nuse Office 365 in the email,\n\n507\n00:28:08.739 --> 00:28:12.599\nyou gotta have something that says hey,\nthis email server, somewhere\n\n508\n00:28:12.599 --> 00:28:17.380\non your network, can actually connect and\nget connected out to the other side.\n\n509\n00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:22.070\nSo you do have to pay attention to\nthese types of readiness checks.\n\n510\n00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.654\nWithout doing that, right, you may\nactually find yourself in the middle of\n\n511\n00:28:25.654 --> 00:28:29.577\nthat testing, in the middle of that pilot,\nand you go well no, my user is using it.\n\n512\n00:28:29.577 --> 00:28:32.972\nAnd then, now you're saying,\nall right, let me go ahead and\n\n513\n00:28:32.972 --> 00:28:36.910\nconnect existing email or\nusers that have email over to Office 365.\n\n514\n00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.090\nAnd then you'll go, oops, I can't do it.\n\n515\n00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:39.630\nWell why?\n\n516\n00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:44.340\nWe have that instance there where it's\nnot gonna allow us to be able to do that.\n\n517\n00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.994\nOnce we get that corrected,\nthen we know that we're actually off and\n\n518\n00:28:47.994 --> 00:28:49.004\nwe are ready to go.\n\n519\n00:28:49.004 --> 00:28:53.940\nSo even during the pilot testing, right,\nwe're actually preparing our network.\n\n520\n00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.920\nWe're preparing our user, we're preparing\nour Exchange Server for making sure, what?\n\n521\n00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.302\nThat it's ready for\nthe connection over to Office 365.\n\n522\n00:29:01.302 --> 00:29:05.732\nSo the pilot checks that we do right there\nat the beginning, before even the pilot\n\n523\n00:29:05.732 --> 00:29:10.300\nhappens, is really preparing your\nentire network for a full deployment.\n\n524\n00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.530\nAnd so this is why they also, you might\nhear it called fast track deployment,\n\n525\n00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.040\ninstead of the old\nstandard deployment here.\n\n526\n00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.390\nAnd that's why,\nis because you plan it first, right?\n\n527\n00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.210\nYou get everything ready to go in your\npilot, then you can deploy it and then you\n\n528\n00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.920\ncan enhance, you actually figure it all\nout, as you're actually going along.\n\n529\n00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.839\nAnd once that's done,\nall I'm doing is I'm adding Daniel and\n\n530\n00:29:29.839 --> 00:29:31.227\nthe entire IT department in.\n\n531\n00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:36.142\nAnd then from that point on, it really is,\nit's just giving the user a username, and\n\n532\n00:29:36.142 --> 00:29:37.320\na password.\n\n533\n00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.690\nSaying log in, and let's go ahead and\nget our emails connected, and\n\n534\n00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:41.950\nwe're ready to go.\n\n535\n00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:47.440\nSo it's not really complex for\nthe entirety of the organization.\n\n536\n00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.920\nIt does have to actually do with\na bit of planning at the beginning.\n\n537\n00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.500\nAnd getting those readiness checks down\nare one of the most important things that\n\n538\n00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.110\nwe can do for our Office 365 pilot.\n\n539\n00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.140\n>> Now Ronnie,\nI couldn't agree with you more.\n\n540\n00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.972\nMaking sure that your\nenvironment is ready,\n\n541\n00:30:00.972 --> 00:30:04.213\nthis is the step that a lot of people can\ntend to overlook, to be honest with you.\n\n542\n00:30:04.213 --> 00:30:06.330\nI know, you think, oh, that's maddening.\n\n543\n00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:07.430\nHow could you not check and\n\n544\n00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:11.440\nsee if your systems are prepared to\ntake the software that you're about to.\n\n545\n00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.270\nA lot of times we just go,\na boss walks in and says hey,\n\n546\n00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.420\nI heard about Office 365\ntoday on some tech article.\n\n547\n00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.571\nI think that's the way we should go,\nimplement it.\n\n548\n00:30:20.571 --> 00:30:22.370\nYou go, okay.\n\n549\n00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:28.990\nSo you're kind of being prodded into that\nvenue and kinda made to make that work.\n\n550\n00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.545\nThey don't care how you get it to work,\n\n551\n00:30:30.545 --> 00:30:32.207\nthey just want it to\nwork cuz they like it.\n\n552\n00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:35.754\nOkay, well that's fine, but\nif you don't plan out ahead of time,\n\n553\n00:30:35.754 --> 00:30:37.633\nyou're never gonna get it to work.\n\n554\n00:30:37.633 --> 00:30:41.736\nAnd having them give you a nice\nplatform which to say, okay,\n\n555\n00:30:41.736 --> 00:30:46.563\nwell you're even giving me the necessary\nability to check my network,\n\n556\n00:30:46.563 --> 00:30:49.110\nmake sure everything is running.\n\n557\n00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.162\nWe run into things like we\nsaw with Ronnie's report.\n\n558\n00:30:51.162 --> 00:30:53.136\nWe gotta open a report, okay,\nwe got a firewall issue,\n\n559\n00:30:53.136 --> 00:30:54.438\nwe had a little bit of a domain issue.\n\n560\n00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:58.023\nNot a problem,\nat least I can see where a problem might\n\n561\n00:30:58.023 --> 00:31:02.101\nbe before I ever start to try to\nget neck deep into this thing.\n\n562\n00:31:02.101 --> 00:31:04.866\nAnd avoid a real problem down the road and\n\n563\n00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:08.454\nnot really waste all the work\nthat I've done so far.\n\n564\n00:31:08.454 --> 00:31:13.360\nNow Ronnie, I know you have a whole lot\nmore to talk about when it comes to this.\n\n565\n00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.950\nWe've really just scratched the surface\nof this, but our time has run very short.\n\n566\n00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.740\n>> Yeah,\na lot of times it really is important,\n\n567\n00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.980\nwe always talk about this idea, right.\n\n568\n00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.670\nThat getting the preparation\nsteps down makes what\n\n569\n00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.850\nthe rest of whatever we\nwanna do work smoother.\n\n570\n00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.890\nAnd that's what we want here and\nthis readiness checks.\n\n571\n00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:36.250\nBypassing this particular step\nis gonna cause issues later on.\n\n572\n00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.840\nSo make sure you do this for\nyour organization in getting it ready for\n\n573\n00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.710\nthe Office 365 deployment side of it.\n\n574\n00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.350\nAnd then if you are gonna be\nconnecting in things like email,\n\n575\n00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.800\nrunning that email check\non your Exchange Server,\n\n576\n00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.210\nverifying that everything is actually\nup and operating at that point,\n\n577\n00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.600\nis also gonna be correct and true as well,\nand do everything that we need.\n\n578\n00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.010\nNow, remember that those readiness checks,\nthey don't go back and\n\n579\n00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.860\ngo oh, click here and let me correct them.\n\n580\n00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.090\nIt's a manual process, and so\nwhat does this mean for you?\n\n581\n00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.590\nWell, hopefully it means for\n\n582\n00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:10.194\nyou as an IT personnel right,\nyou actually know what can be done there.\n\n583\n00:32:10.194 --> 00:32:13.490\nRight, and you know how to actually fix\nthose things, like the firewall issue.\n\n584\n00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.954\nIs this just a Windows firewall issue or\nis this actually\n\n585\n00:32:16.954 --> 00:32:21.022\nthe entirety of your firewall at\nthe edge of your network, okay?\n\n586\n00:32:21.022 --> 00:32:24.008\nThe same thing here with\nthe domain settings.\n\n587\n00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:25.919\nIf you are the IT technician,\nit says look,\n\n588\n00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:27.839\nit's telling me that I've got DNS errors.\n\n589\n00:32:27.839 --> 00:32:31.793\nWell, that might not be your job, but it\nmeans you might have to escalate that and\n\n590\n00:32:31.793 --> 00:32:35.830\nsay hey, we need to get these DNS issues\ncorrected if we want to use Office 365.\n\n591\n00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:39.527\nOn the Exchange Server side, it's\nthe same thing with whatever it produced.\n\n592\n00:32:39.527 --> 00:32:42.211\nNow, if you actually have\nthose prerequisite checks, and\n\n593\n00:32:42.211 --> 00:32:45.701\none of the prerequisite checks that may\nnot have actually worked because I was\n\n594\n00:32:45.701 --> 00:32:50.210\nusing the newest edition of 2016, it\ndoesn't mean that we'll completely fail.\n\n595\n00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:54.480\nBut what it means is that particular\nchecker right then, right, says,\n\n596\n00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.054\nI require a 2013, Ronnie,\nyou're running 2016.\n\n597\n00:32:58.054 --> 00:33:01.611\nAnd it means you may just have to\nkind of pilot that out yourself and\n\n598\n00:33:01.611 --> 00:33:03.820\nsee if it actually works there instead.\n\n599\n00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:08.406\nCuz I'm kind of taking a gamble that it's\nworking as we're actually setting this\n\n600\n00:33:08.406 --> 00:33:09.450\nstuff up.\n\n601\n00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.660\nBut overall though,\nthis is what will help you.\n\n602\n00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.700\nThe good thing is you don't have manually\ngo and figure out what are you missing.\n\n603\n00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.581\nYou fix that stuff,\nrun the readiness checks again, and\n\n604\n00:33:18.581 --> 00:33:20.930\nhopefully those errors start disappearing.\n\n605\n00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:25.384\nAnd then you are now ready to at least\nbegin the next step in the process of\n\n606\n00:33:25.384 --> 00:33:27.700\nplanning out your deployment.\n\n607\n00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.570\n>> That's right, well Ronnie,\nI really appreciate you coming in.\n\n608\n00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:31.630\nI know our viewers do as well.\n\n609\n00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:34.210\nShowing us what they mean by pilot and\n\n610\n00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:39.140\ngetting us ready to start implementing\na pilot program into Office 365.\n\n611\n00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.840\nBut obviously we're gonna have to jump\ninto a part two and, you never know,\n\n612\n00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840\nmaybe even a part three on that.\n\n613\n00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.370\nBut definitely a part two, so\nhopefully, we'll see you guys there.\n\n614\n00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:48.672\nThanks again, Ronnie, and\nthank you for watching.\n\n615\n00:33:48.672 --> 00:33:50.560\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n616\n00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.360\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n617\n00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:52.960\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n618\n00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.170\n>> And we'll

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.620\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're gonna\n\n4\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.930\ncontinue taking a look at our managing\nOffice 365 identities and requirements.\n\n5\n00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.420\nJoining me again for this episode\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.670\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n7\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.430\nHow are you today?\n\n8\n00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.250\n>> I am doing fine, as we continue to take\na look at the idea of planning a pilot for\n\n9\n00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.350\neverything that we're doing here.\n\n10\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.880\nAnd what we're actually\nmoving on to of course,\n\n11\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.550\nis this next little bit of the process\nthat we have to do after checking our\n\n12\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.160\nreadiness for\nOffice 365 in our environment.\n\n13\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.810\nNow, before we actually move on from\nthere, we already talked about that\n\n14\n00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.495\nthere's readiness tools if\nwe're using Exchange Server.\n\n15\n00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:57.500\nWe also talked about checking\nout our environment and\n\n16\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.380\nthat there's tools available for us.\n\n17\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.030\nOffice 365 has thought about this.\n\n18\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.493\nThey're in the pilot development,\n\n19\n00:01:03.493 --> 00:01:07.660\nright, it's not about discovering\nall the ways that Office can't work.\n\n20\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.800\nThey want us to actually plan that out and\n\n21\n00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.095\ntake a look at those checks\nbefore anything happens here.\n\n22\n00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:14.515\nAnd that way, we actually go ahead and\n\n23\n00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:18.375\ntry and fix those things before\nour pilot even rolls out.\n\n24\n00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:22.225\nNow, there's one other consideration that\nwe need to do, so it's kind of a leftover,\n\n25\n00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:25.490\nbut at the same time, it's actually\nan important subject on its own.\n\n26\n00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.995\nIs that not only did we talk about\nthe environment as far as our network and\n\n27\n00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:32.560\nthe machines being ready, and also,\nof course, Exchange Server being ready.\n\n28\n00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.510\nBut along with that, for\nthe majority of us is also gonna be, well,\n\n29\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.290\ndo I wrap up also Active Directory in\nmy Office 365 environment as well?\n\n30\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.430\nSo, a lot of times if you're\nactually doing something like that,\n\n31\n00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.590\nwhere you believe that you're gonna be\nmigrating even Office 365 over, well,\n\n32\n00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.622\nyou wanna actually want to do\na check on your Active Directory.\n\n33\n00:01:54.622 --> 00:01:57.350\nAnd that's because there is\nactually synchronization that will\n\n34\n00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.960\nhave to happen between your own\npremises active directory, and\n\n35\n00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.350\nof course Office 365 is using Azure AD,\nAzure's active directory\n\n36\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.800\nto actually build a little bit of\nan active directory structure for us.\n\n37\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.370\nSo that what we can actually do with\nOffice 365 is have a single sign on.\n\n38\n00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.420\nRegardless of whether you're actually\nusing a workstation inside of your\n\n39\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.230\nnetwork, or\n\n40\n00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.620\nwhether you're actually somewhere else in\nthe world, being able to do something like\n\n41\n00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.290\nsingle sign-on might be something that\nyou choose to do for your network.\n\n42\n00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.660\nSo, of course, that means that we need\nto make sure that our active directory\n\n43\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.310\nis gonna be ready for us to go.\n\n44\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.190\nNow, what are some of the things\nthat we might need to check for?\n\n45\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.200\nWell the good thing is Office has already\ngiven us another tool that we can use.\n\n46\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.280\nSo not only do we have\nthose readiness checks but\n\n47\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.490\nthe one that we're taking is not actually\nin that same area that we took a look at.\n\n48\n00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.140\nThis is something that you actually\nhave to download from the internet and\n\n49\n00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.670\nthat's what we call IdFix,\nis the one that we have here.\n\n50\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.545\nSo that's the tool that we want to\ntake advantage of when we start here.\n\n51\n00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:58.880\nOkay, IdFix is gonna allow us to actually\ndo a couple of different things.\n\n52\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.580\nOne, discover any errors that will block\nthe active directory synchronization.\n\n53\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.980\nAnd two, it's gonna be able to\nremediate the majority of them.\n\n54\n00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.160\nNow it's not gonna actually\nbe able to remediate a ton of\n\n55\n00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.990\neverything else that we\nmight have over there.\n\n56\n00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.020\nAnd the reason why is that over the years,\n\n57\n00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.631\nif your active directory has\nbeen around a long time.\n\n58\n00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:19.582\nThere's still different attributes,\n\n59\n00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:22.966\nthere's still different things that\nactually might exist in there,\n\n60\n00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:26.422\nand maybe Office 365 and Azure said,\nwe don't support it anymore.\n\n61\n00:03:26.422 --> 00:03:30.881\nSo it's not the very fact that it can't\ndo it, it's the very fact that it didn't\n\n62\n00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:35.213\nexist when server 2003 interactive\ndirectory was still coming along from\n\n63\n00:03:35.213 --> 00:03:40.096\nthose times, where it's actually still\nsupporting some of those structures.\n\n64\n00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:43.000\nBut this IdFix here,\nwill actually go ahead and try and\n\n65\n00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.770\nremediate everything that it can, so\nthat you can check and verify that hey,\n\n66\n00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.920\nif I know that I'm gonna be doing this in\nthe future, we're gonna actually make sure\n\n67\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.760\nthat we have the directory synchronization\nin the way that we need to.\n\n68\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.090\nThis tool is gonna be the most\nhelpful tool that you can run.\n\n69\n00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.240\nSo there's a couple of issues here.\n\n70\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.340\nI remember the first time that I ran\nthis tool and I really mean this.\n\n71\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.350\nThe first time I ran this tool I thought,\nwell, if I'm gonna run this against\n\n72\n00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.640\nActive Directory, it absolutely\nmeans that I need to be where?\n\n73\n00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.430\nI need to be on a domain controller run.\n\n74\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.560\nMakes sense.\n\n75\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.490\nBut in all of reality, you don't have to.\n\n76\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.500\nAnd I'm mentioning this again just for\nthose of you that are getting ready for\n\n77\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.310\nthe exam, you gotta remember that some of\nthese tools, like the Exchange Server.\n\n78\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.110\nYou definitely need to make sure that\nthat Office tool that you run for\n\n79\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.470\nthe readiness check runs on\nthe Exchange Server, makes sense.\n\n80\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.400\nInside your network, right,\n\n81\n00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.160\nif you're actually preparing and you've\ngot workstations, you gotta make sure that\n\n82\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.390\nyou're actually on a domain joined\ncomputer that will run that, and\n\n83\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.380\nyou wanna do that on each of those models\nof hardware support that you're doing.\n\n84\n00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.780\nMake sure that's ready too.\n\n85\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.550\nBut with this IdFix, running on active\ndirectory, you might go, well, do\n\n86\n00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.800\nI need to run this on every single one of\nmy machines hosting active directory then?\n\n87\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.800\nBelieve it or not, you really don't.\n\n88\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.720\nThis is kind of a neat thing.\n\n89\n00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.680\nAll you need to do is be on\na domain joined computer, and\n\n90\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.220\nthere are some other prerequisites here,\nand\n\n91\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.370\nlet me make sure that I tell you\nthe right thing about the prerequisites.\n\n92\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.540\nOne of the most important\nprerequisites is simple.\n\n93\n00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.020\nIt's who the user is that's gonna run it.\n\n94\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.306\nThe user that runs IdFix\nneeds to make sure that\n\n95\n00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:17.710\nIdFix has the ability to read and\nwrite access to the directory.\n\n96\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.060\nSo that means whoever the user is,\n\n97\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.210\nthey have to be able to control\nActive Directory a little bit,\n\n98\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.540\nbe able to change records, be able to\nread them, makes a little bit of sense.\n\n99\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.348\nSo probably it's gonna be a domain admin,\nI would assume, or\n\n100\n00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:29.922\nsomebody that has access to that.\n\n101\n00:05:29.922 --> 00:05:33.296\nThe other thing, of course,\nis gonna be Framework 4.0.\n\n102\n00:05:33.296 --> 00:05:35.370\nIt has to be installed.\n\n103\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.710\nIf you're running Server 2008 or\n\n104\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.130\nlater, more than likely, the .NET\nframework 4.0 is already installed.\n\n105\n00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.820\nBut besides that, you just need to be on\na domain joined computer that you actually\n\n106\n00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.900\nare gonna be on, and then you can run this\nid fix and that actually help you out.\n\n107\n00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.310\nSo I'm gonna be on this domain joined\ncomputer here, and we'll run this ID fix,\n\n108\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.710\nis what we want to take a look at.\n\n109\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.380\n>> Now, Ronnie, are there any\nhardware requirements when it comes\n\n110\n00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.530\nto running IdFix, or\njust any old run of the mill\n\n111\n00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.350\ndomain joined computer that's logged\nin by an admin should be good to go?\n\n112\n00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.380\n>> Yeah,\nthere are some hardware requirements,\n\n113\n00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.020\nso usually on this particular type of\ncomputer you want to make sure there's at\n\n114\n00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.050\nleast 2 gigs of hard drive space,\nif I tell you right, yep.\n\n115\n00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.840\nAnd so that's at least the minimum, and\n\n116\n00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.660\nthen 4 gigs of RAM is what it normally\nwants you to actually run this thing on.\n\n117\n00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.530\nSo that is kind of the careful\nrequirement that you want to make\n\n118\n00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.870\nsure that you do have.\n\n119\n00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.381\nNow, you might be wondering\nwhy such a big requirement?\n\n120\n00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:33.629\nWell, think about your Active Directory,\nright?\n\n121\n00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:35.723\nIf there are a ton of errors,\n\n122\n00:06:35.723 --> 00:06:39.640\nthis particular utility\nis gonna generate a log.\n\n123\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.350\nOkay, and if you actually have\na lot of replication going on,\n\n124\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.610\nit can generate a relatively large log.\n\n125\n00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.640\nAnd everything that it generates\nis gonna be done in a CSV file,\n\n126\n00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.270\nso it shouldn't be gigantic,\nbut remember it takes time to\n\n127\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.900\nactually go throughout your\nentire directory to do this.\n\n128\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.890\nSo, the more replication that you have,\nin other words,\n\n129\n00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.080\nthe more active directory domain\ncontrollers that you have,\n\n130\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.590\nas hosting an active directory\nis gonna take a lot longer time.\n\n131\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.985\nI'm only doing that on one machine,\nit's not gonna take that long of time.\n\n132\n00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:11.235\nBut you kinda have to be ready for\nthat, and then it would generate a lot.\n\n133\n00:07:11.235 --> 00:07:12.475\nLet's go ahead and do this.\n\n134\n00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:13.785\nSo here it is.\n\n135\n00:07:13.785 --> 00:07:18.934\nI am on my Windows 10 machine, and this\none is joined to my IT Pro TV domain or\n\n136\n00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:23.855\nmy IT Pro TV demo domain, and\nI'm suddenly gonna launch a browser here.\n\n137\n00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:26.590\nThis is the new Edge\nbrowser in Windows 10.\n\n138\n00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.150\nAnd I'm just gonna type in IdFix\nright here at the beginning, and\n\n139\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.820\nyou can see that even with\nthis particular search engine,\n\n140\n00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.250\nyou can use whatever\nsearch engine you want to.\n\n141\n00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.340\nI'm gonna select install and\nrun the IdFix tool, and that brings us\n\n142\n00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.588\nto the official Microsoft site that\nwill allow us to be able to do this.\n\n143\n00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:47.291\nSo it does give us these options up\nhere about finishing these tasks and\n\n144\n00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:48.501\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n145\n00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:51.946\nIt says you can just try and do it, and\nIdFix doesn't have to work if you don't\n\n146\n00:07:51.946 --> 00:07:54.755\nwant it to, and you can still try\nto synchronize, but of course\n\n147\n00:07:54.755 --> 00:07:58.267\nthe better thing is to actually run this\nto make sure that everything is ready.\n\n148\n00:07:58.267 --> 00:08:00.157\nSo there's the minimal requirements and\n\n149\n00:08:00.157 --> 00:08:02.101\nthe one that I want is\nthis link right here.\n\n150\n00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:06.810\nSo, I did all that so that we can\ncome down to this link that says,\n\n151\n00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.796\nIdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool.\n\n152\n00:08:09.796 --> 00:08:12.584\nAnd when I do that,\nI'm going to select that.\n\n153\n00:08:12.584 --> 00:08:15.300\nAnd then, it's gonna give me\nthis download right here.\n\n154\n00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.820\nAnd you can download that, and\nthen run it directly from your computer.\n\n155\n00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.190\nNow, I've already downloaded this so\nI'm not gonna download it again.\n\n156\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.520\nAnd I click on that little button, and\nI go to my, where's my downloads here?\n\n157\n00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.620\nWhy can't I find my downloads?\n\n158\n00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.030\nLet me see.\n\n159\n00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.940\nSee where I actually put it here.\n\n160\n00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.300\nGet into my file explorer,\nand go to downloads.\n\n161\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.140\nThere we go.\n\n162\n00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.020\nSo, you'll notice that\nactually two zip files.\n\n163\n00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.910\nI had downloaded previously.\n\n164\n00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.840\nI'm gonna right click and\nextract it so that we can see it.\n\n165\n00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.320\nAnd it's right here.\n\n166\n00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.870\nIt gives us a little office IdFix\nguide that you can also read through.\n\n167\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.110\nAnd I, of course,\nrecommend that you read through this to\n\n168\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.250\nactually know when to run it.\n\n169\n00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.520\nBut I'm simply going to\ndouble click on that tool.\n\n170\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.810\nAnd it's gonna say, hey,\nlook, this is for IdFix only.\n\n171\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.400\nIn other words,\nthe end user licensing agreement.\n\n172\n00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.280\nAnd what it actually does which creates\nthis comma separated file, value file,\n\n173\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.220\nfor us, or the ldap data exchange format.\n\n174\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.470\nI'm gonna click okay.\n\n175\n00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.950\nAnd there's the tool that it brings up.\n\n176\n00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.880\nNow, remember that if your active\ndirectory is pretty large,\n\n177\n00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.740\nthis might take a few minutes here.\n\n178\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.730\nBut it's a fairly simple tool.\n\n179\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.510\nThere's not a lot of options for\nus that are available.\n\n180\n00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:27.010\nBut notice I have this little gear that\nallows me to say what am I actually doing?\n\n181\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.550\nIs there a possibility in the future I'm\ngoing to be a multi-tenant inside of\n\n182\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.490\nactive directory?\n\n183\n00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.540\nPretty much so.\n\n184\n00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.810\nOr just going to be dedicated.\n\n185\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.010\nIt just depends on what you want to do.\n\n186\n00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.329\nAnd I'm gonna leave it at its defaults.\n\n187\n00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:40.100\nIt already found the directory domain,\nright here for us.\n\n188\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.390\nSo, it knows exactly\nwhat it's looking for.\n\n189\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.120\nAnd if I needed to change it, in other\nwords, if I said, look, I need somebody to\n\n190\n00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.430\nrun this, but I'm not giving them\ncontrol of Active Directory to read or\n\n191\n00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.450\nwrite to it, well,\nI can instead just provide with\n\n192\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.920\ncredentials right now if I wanted to and\nnot actually have to log in.\n\n193\n00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.589\nBut I'm logged in as the domain admin.\n\n194\n00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.550\nSo then, the next thing that we\nwant is simply where it says query.\n\n195\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.600\nAnd we'll run that query.\n\n196\n00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.770\nAnd it'll be able to check against active\ndirectory to see if the synchronization's\n\n197\n00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:07.870\ngonna be ready.\n\n198\n00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.270\nNow, I went ahead, and\n\n199\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.590\nwhen I ran this, I can see where the query\ncount is 96 down here at the bottom.\n\n200\n00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.250\nAnd there's no errors.\n\n201\n00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.480\nSo that's actually pretty good.\n\n202\n00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.060\nBut wherever you do find errors,\nyou normally can click on that error, and\n\n203\n00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.050\nthen you can go ahead and\napply whatever fix it recommends for\n\n204\n00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.340\nthe remediation if you have\nany other tools besides that.\n\n205\n00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.040\nSo, once you're actually done\nrunning something like that, right,\n\n206\n00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.810\nif it does find all those errors,\nand then you change them,\n\n207\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.600\nin the end it's gonna generate another\nfile for us which is right here.\n\n208\n00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.320\nAnd this one is labeled.\n\n209\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.340\nIt says, Verbose one, five, 2016.\n\n210\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:46.320\nAnd that also gives me a dash date here,\nI guess a time.\n\n211\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.220\nYep, that's the timestamp,\nis what it also gives me.\n\n212\n00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.630\nAnd I double click on that thing.\n\n213\n00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.830\nAnd let me change the format so\nthat we can see it.\n\n214\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.981\nBecause there's no actual errors here.\n\n215\n00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.930\nSee, we can see that a little bit easier.\n\n216\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:00.430\nThere we go.\n\n217\n00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.610\nAnd we just take a look at,\noop, well, maybe.\n\n218\n00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.655\nSo, we'll see what it actually did here.\n\n219\n00:11:11.655 --> 00:11:14.030\nOkay?\nSo, there, of course, it was started.\n\n220\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.210\nAnd it started loading\nthe top level domain list.\n\n221\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.560\nAnd so, there's the initial query.\n\n222\n00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.550\nAnd now, here's the actual rules for\nthat querying that we did.\n\n223\n00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.980\nIt established a connection, of course,\nto the, to our Active Directory.\n\n224\n00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.401\nIt was able to do a count there.\n\n225\n00:11:30.401 --> 00:11:34.540\nAnd it's a duplicate checked counts.\n\n226\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.540\nAnd then, you can see where it\nwas actually able to write or\n\n227\n00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.390\nsplit, merge files, count duplicates.\n\n228\n00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.780\nAnd I found no duplicates.\n\n229\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.220\nAnd it gave us the elapsed time and\neverything else.\n\n230\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.700\nSo, it was looking for duplicates.\n\n231\n00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.760\nIt was looking errors.\n\n232\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.870\nIt's looking for whatever it can.\n\n233\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.980\nAnd at the end there,\nif it does return for\n\n234\n00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.850\nus that list, then we can click fix and\nit will go ahead and fix that.\n\n235\n00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.180\nWe would run it again.\n\n236\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.760\nThe recommendation, of course,\n\n237\n00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.250\nis that once you're done with that, is you\ndon't leave this tool on that workstation\n\n238\n00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.380\ncuz then somebody else decides\nthey wanna run it again.\n\n239\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.360\nBut the good thing is,\nif you're logged in with your account,\n\n240\n00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.070\nwhen you log out they shouldn't be\ngetting access to your account.\n\n241\n00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.470\nBut the recommendation, of course, is that\nat the end of it, is just to go ahead and\n\n242\n00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.070\ndelete it right out.\n\n243\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.660\nNotice it doesn't actually\ncreate any registry hooks.\n\n244\n00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.860\nIt didn't really install.\n\n245\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.483\nIt was just to kinda RAM resident type\n\n246\n00:12:20.483 --> 00:12:23.970\nof application right there for\nus to be able to run.\n\n247\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.890\nSo we would simply delete that out.\n\n248\n00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:30.840\nAnd then, of course, delete out all\nour recycle bin, and it would be gone.\n\n249\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.510\nSo, it doesn't need to\nbe run all the time.\n\n250\n00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:36.030\nBut if you actually do have that\npossibility where you're gonna be using\n\n251\n00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:40.060\nthat in the future, and that's normally\nwhat ends up happening, is that because we\n\n252\n00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.540\nwant the ability to do single sign-on,\nwe're gonna use a tool like that to verify\n\n253\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.022\nthat the directory synchronization is\ngonna work the way that we want it to.\n\n254\n00:12:49.022 --> 00:12:50.630\nSo, that's one of the, also,\n\n255\n00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:55.503\nreadiness checks that we want as well\ninside of our planning for our pilot, too.\n\n256\n00:12:55.503 --> 00:12:56.362\nOkay?\n>> Excellent.\n\n257\n00:12:56.362 --> 00:12:56.893\nAll right.\n\n258\n00:12:56.893 --> 00:12:57.886\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, obviously,\n\n259\n00:12:57.886 --> 00:13:02.170\nthere again, giving us plenty of tools to\nmake sure that the environment that we're\n\n260\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.880\nworking in is actually going to\nwork with the Office 365 suite.\n\n261\n00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.980\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n262\n00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.620\nThat's what we want.\n\n263\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.430\nVery nice tool.\n\n264\n00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.520\nIf you have an Active Directory domain,\nyou're probably going to need to run this\n\n265\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.830\nbecause you're most likely going to be\nintegrating Office 365 into your domain,\n\n266\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.810\ngiving you all the nice control and\nhooks that are necessary.\n\n267\n00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:21.800\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n268\n00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.160\nNow, that being said,\nwe've done a lot of prerequisite checking.\n\n269\n00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.130\nWe've done a lot of of getting ready for\nthis.\n\n270\n00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.240\nAre we now ready?\n\n271\n00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.270\nOr do we have anything else?\n\n272\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.610\nOr can we light this fire?\n\n273\n00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.580\n>> Well, there's a little bit, right,\n\n274\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.896\nthat we still have to make\nsure that we do here.\n\n275\n00:13:34.896 --> 00:13:37.960\nAnd some of it, the good thing is we've\nalready done it in other episodes.\n\n276\n00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.650\nBut we wanna make sure that we\nreview this as well, and get ready.\n\n277\n00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.120\nSo, if you know that you\nare definitely heading this way,\n\n278\n00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.000\nand you want to make sure that everything\nis set up, the next thing, of course,\n\n279\n00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.690\nis to verify that you have your domain\nset up and ready to work with Office 365.\n\n280\n00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.200\nRemember that when you create\nyour first tenant account\n\n281\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.760\nit automatically takes your domain,\nwhatever you give it, and\n\n282\n00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.350\nit checks it against a list of all\nthe domains that are used out there.\n\n283\n00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.100\nSo, I used ITProTVdemo is what I used.\n\n284\n00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.480\nAnd when I created that tenant account,\nit automatically appended in at\n\n285\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.460\nthe end there itprotv.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n286\n00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.670\nWell, I did not want to use\nthe onmicrosoft.com part.\n\n287\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.120\nSo, the way that we do that is we go\nback in and we add in a custom domain.\n\n288\n00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.120\nSo, just as a way of review here,\non my machine,\n\n289\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.500\nwe go back into the little button there,\nand then we select the admin tools.\n\n290\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.520\nI know that there are actually\ntiles down here on the page.\n\n291\n00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.540\nI like using that little button tool,\nis the way I like going here.\n\n292\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.340\nAnd then, over on the left hand side,\nyou have two options here.\n\n293\n00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.550\nAnd this an option I didn't point out\nwhen we were doing this manually, but\n\n294\n00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.170\nthere is two option for you to get set up.\n\n295\n00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.760\nIf you go ahead and\ncreate that provisioned account,\n\n296\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.340\nthat straight demo account,\nnormally where it leads you is right here.\n\n297\n00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.410\nAnd so, right here at the very beginning,\nyou actually get back to this page.\n\n298\n00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.630\nAnd then, you go and\nfind where it says admin.\n\n299\n00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.420\nSo I'll use this other one.\n\n300\n00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.670\nAnd once you're here, it actually\ncan walk you through the set up.\n\n301\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.850\nIn other words,\nthey do build Wizards in here.\n\n302\n00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.900\nI just chose to do it manually,\nwhen we actually, did the manual set up.\n\n303\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:17.400\nBut you can click, notice very next here,\nright after dashboard, it says, set up.\n\n304\n00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.830\nAnd my select set up at this point here,\n\n305\n00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.510\nnotice it actually will\nwalk me through a wizard.\n\n306\n00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.160\nAnd there it is.\nIt says start the setup.\n\n307\n00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.100\nAnd if I click on start set up, you'll see\nthe very next thing it's asking you to do\n\n308\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.760\nhere is to personalize the set up.\n\n309\n00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.325\nI don't have any user data right now,\n\n310\n00:15:36.325 --> 00:15:38.540\ncuz we're gonna talk about\nthat in just a moment.\n\n311\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.080\nBut I can click next there.\n\n312\n00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.840\nAnd then,\nthe next thing that it's gonna ask me is,\n\n313\n00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.850\nessentially, set up my own domain, right?\n\n314\n00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:49.882\nAnd so, this is where did, if you haven't\nseen that, make sure you go back and\n\n315\n00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:54.484\ncheck out the provisioning tenants,\nor adding in your custom domain.\n\n316\n00:15:54.484 --> 00:15:57.348\nAnd you'll see that this is where\nyou go ahead and get this set up.\n\n317\n00:15:57.348 --> 00:16:02.066\nSo it's here that we added\nin the records that verify\n\n318\n00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:06.258\nthat I own The itprotvdemo.com\ndomain name.\n\n319\n00:16:06.258 --> 00:16:11.370\nAnd I do that inside of where\nmy DNS register is going to be.\n\n320\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.460\nAnd I simply added in the text file that\nMicrosoft wanted me to create inside\n\n321\n00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.580\nof that record.\n\n322\n00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.010\nMicrosoft then reached out and\n\n323\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.180\nwas able to verify that I was\nable to create that record.\n\n324\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.230\nAnd then, when it did so,\nI continued on through the wizard here.\n\n325\n00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:29.720\nAnd the next thing it asked me was\nto provide the purpose of my domain.\n\n326\n00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.980\nAnd I selected, I think,\nthree options there.\n\n327\n00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.290\nOne for SharePoint, one for Exchange and\none for Skype for Business.\n\n328\n00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.810\nAnd when I did that,\nit created three different sets\n\n329\n00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.760\nof DNS records that I\nadded into my registrar.\n\n330\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.270\nSo remember that if you're in\nthe small business, well, Office 365,\n\n331\n00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.590\nyou actually have that small business\naccount, and you're doing this on your\n\n332\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.600\nown, well, Office 365 will host\nthose DNS records for you.\n\n333\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.420\nIf you are using the mid size business\naccounts or any of the enterprise accounts\n\n334\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.530\nor higher, that means you're gonna use\nyour own DNS register to go ahead and\n\n335\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:12.460\nmake sure that those particular\nrecords are also set in your DNS.\n\n336\n00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.740\nAnd that's a manual process.\n\n337\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.605\nSo, go back and check that out.\n\n338\n00:17:15.605 --> 00:17:17.490\nWe actually only added in one record.\n\n339\n00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.050\nBut the other records,\nit's kinda the same suit.\n\n340\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:20.930\nYou just need to be careful.\n\n341\n00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.010\nMake sure you follow the guides\nthat are actually there for\n\n342\n00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.390\nyou to add in those additional records.\n\n343\n00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.410\nOnce that's done, right,\nthat will now give us the ability, and\n\n344\n00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:36.520\nwhat gave us the ability to essentially\nremove the onmicrosoft.com from our users.\n\n345\n00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.860\nLet me see if I can go backward here for\na moment.\n\n346\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.240\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n347\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.510\nThere it goes.\n\n348\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.030\nLet's see if it actually allows me to\ngo all the way back to the portal here.\n\n349\n00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.350\nThere it goes.\n\n350\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.520\nAnd in one I selected users and\nactive users here.\n\n351\n00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.740\nYou can see instead it\nactually does say itprotvdemo.\n\n352\n00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.570\nIt doesn't say onmicrosoft.com now.\n\n353\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.170\nNow are those things still valid?\n\n354\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.370\nYou better believe it.\n\n355\n00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.680\nBut this is what allows\nme to personalize it, so\n\n356\n00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.360\nthat now what I had before is as\nfar as my own email addresses,\n\n357\n00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.945\nthen on my own on premises Exchange\nserver, now on Office 365.\n\n358\n00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:18.170\nUsers can log in using that but they can\nalso send email and it comes here too.\n\n359\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.690\nSo it's getting that set up is\nanother important part of that process\n\n360\n00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.010\nof getting the pilot door.\n\n361\n00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.620\nAnd you do, you want to set it up now.\n\n362\n00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.320\nWhy?\n\n363\n00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.310\nBecause as users start getting added\nin once you say we're going to go and\n\n364\n00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.820\nDaniel hands me a list of 150 people,\n\n365\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.090\nwell is it at that point that I\nwant to also try and set this up?\n\n366\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.550\nNo.\nIf I get this set up\n\n367\n00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:42.140\nall Daniel's really handing me is\na list of people I need to add in to\n\n368\n00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:47.110\nthe user console and\nthen we're off and we are ready to go.\n\n369\n00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.270\nSo just by review right there,\n\n370\n00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.350\nthat's a pretty important\npart is to get that setup.\n\n371\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.680\nSo remember, those are the steps, right?\n\n372\n00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.890\nYou have to be able to verify\nthat you own that domain name.\n\n373\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.400\nSecondly, or when we do that, right?\n\n374\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.960\nWe have to create that single text\nrecord inside a DNS on our registrar.\n\n375\n00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.520\nOnce Microsoft verifies that and\n\n376\n00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.710\nthen we select the purpose of the domain,\nit's gonna create for\n\n377\n00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:16.280\nus multiple DNS records that we need\nto add back into our registrar.\n\n378\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.270\nAnd that's gonna be very important for\nus, especially if we're connecting in and\n\n379\n00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.830\nwe're using our own e-mail.\n\n380\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.510\nIf we don't care about it,\ndon't worry about it at all.\n\n381\n00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:29.072\nIf we're fine with essentially changing\nour entire domain to appending\n\n382\n00:19:29.072 --> 00:19:32.850\nonmicrosoft.com, then\nthey're perfectly fine.\n\n383\n00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:33.630\nIt'll work, too.\n\n384\n00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:37.080\n>> Yes, well, now you're starting\nto see a logical progression here,\n\n385\n00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.100\nat least I am and\nhopefully you are as well.\n\n386\n00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.150\nThat we wanna use Office 365.\n\n387\n00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.050\nWe think that might be a solution for us.\n\n388\n00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.200\nWe start preparing for a test environment.\n\n389\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.920\nIt's the whole thing about this\npilot stuff that Ronnie's been\n\n390\n00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.820\nyammering on about for\nthe last few episodes, right?\n\n391\n00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.730\nSo we're getting into that pilot phase.\n\n392\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.000\nNow, we're at the part where we're\nconnecting our actual domain\n\n393\n00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.375\nto Office 365.\n\n394\n00:19:57.375 --> 00:20:01.080\nRonnie, I think if I'm not mistaken,\nwe might be\n\n395\n00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.110\nright there at the cusp of let's start\nadding some users into this thing.\n\n396\n00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.160\nNow, when we add users, we probably\ndon't wanna just start throwing\n\n397\n00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.810\neverything in the kitchen sink at it.\n\n398\n00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.830\nWho would we want to put in as\na user to get this thing going?\n\n399\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.970\n>> And that's a very important concept,\nright?\n\n400\n00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.560\nAnd the reason why is I know\nthat in software deployment that\n\n401\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.705\nI have done in the past.\n\n402\n00:20:19.705 --> 00:20:22.500\nIt's always been with small organizations,\nit's easy.\n\n403\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.460\nWe just gave the software\nout to everybody.\n\n404\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.370\nAnd of course what would end\nup happening is two of the,\n\n405\n00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:33.350\nlet's say seven or eight people,\nwould actively use that software.\n\n406\n00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.590\nThe other five would essentially\nignore it until we said,\n\n407\n00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.495\nhey, how do you like that software?\n\n408\n00:20:37.495 --> 00:20:39.670\n[LAUGH] Well, they're like, what software?\n\n409\n00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.810\nWell, you know, the one that I gave you\ntwo months ago that you are supposed\n\n410\n00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.640\nto be using actively,\nthat you are supposed to be doing this.\n\n411\n00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.970\nOh, yeah, you installed it.\n\n412\n00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.000\nI don't think I've touched\nit since that point.\n\n413\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.580\nWell, that is a complete waste of what,\ntime more than anything else.\n\n414\n00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.550\nMoney, because you paid for that software\nfor them to be able to use it and\n\n415\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.960\nthey're essentially not using it,\nso there it is, you got that.\n\n416\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.609\nAnd then, three, they might not have any\nclue of how to actually be able to use\n\n417\n00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:09.740\nthat, so you still have to spend time and\neffort to get them trained on it.\n\n418\n00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.220\nSo in a pilot type of\nprogram like with Office 365,\n\n419\n00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.730\nwhen you're selecting users for\nyour pilot, okay?\n\n420\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.830\nYou wanna make sure that you do a couple\nof considerations here by doing this.\n\n421\n00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:26.688\nNow Microsoft does recommend, in other\nwords, there's kinda a best practice here,\n\n422\n00:21:26.688 --> 00:21:29.679\nthat the goal is to make sure\nthat you get users that can\n\n423\n00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:33.370\nalso present the possibility\nof a buyin from other users.\n\n424\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:38.410\nSo you want somebody that is not\njust overly zealous about that\n\n425\n00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:44.710\npossible use of new software but somebody\nthat has fairly good influence, right?\n\n426\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.490\nThe very fact is, you wanna make sure\nthat you have a nice representative\n\n427\n00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:55.240\ngroup of people as far as ages go and,\nof course, usability goes, too.\n\n428\n00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.890\nBut the general numbers,\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n429\n00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:02.810\nis that they recommend about 5% or\nhigher of your users.\n\n430\n00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.580\nNow, that can get expensive with\na gigantic organization, okay?\n\n431\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.880\nWith a small organization,\nit doesn't have to be that expensive,\n\n432\n00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.110\nbut they recommend 5%.\n\n433\n00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.490\nThey're saying look,\nif you choose the right 5% of people,\n\n434\n00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.960\nthe people that will actually use it,\nand they'll like it, or you know,\n\n435\n00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.400\nthey'll be able to also influence what,\nthe other people around them.\n\n436\n00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.196\nSo you want that 5% representative\nof different departments.\n\n437\n00:22:28.196 --> 00:22:33.620\nYou want a actual representative of a good\nuse of people and when we talk about that,\n\n438\n00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.260\nwho are the types of employees\nthat we would end up choosing?\n\n439\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.620\nYou want somebody has been there for\nat least six months.\n\n440\n00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.370\nThey're long-term users.\n\n441\n00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:44.120\nYou don't just include in the person\nthat just was hired right then.\n\n442\n00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.360\nAnd the reason why is that one, they may\nactually be learning about the purpose of\n\n443\n00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.800\nyour organization is and\nnow you're actually just throwing them and\n\n444\n00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.870\ngoing, well here just figure out to use\nthis along cuz you're gonna use that.\n\n445\n00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:57.530\nWell, if you can't get your\nlong-term users to buy into it,\n\n446\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.190\nwhat are the chances, Daniel, that we're\ngonna get people that are brand new\n\n447\n00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.900\nto say that they want to use this product?\n\n448\n00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.220\nIt's not gonna be easy at all, is it?\n\n449\n00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.480\nSo when you start taking a look at that,\n\n450\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.950\nthat's what you also want\nto make sure that you do.\n\n451\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.830\nThe other thing that you want is you want\nto be able to take a little bit of time\n\n452\n00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:17.110\nto get somebody that you can\nactually train to use it as well.\n\n453\n00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.100\nNow, it doesn't mean that you\nhave to always train them.\n\n454\n00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.350\nBut you want trainable people, okay.\n\n455\n00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.275\nSo you don't want the curmudgeon.\n\n456\n00:23:25.275 --> 00:23:27.020\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> You don't want the guy,\n\n457\n00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.090\noh I'd use that but\ni don't really like it.\n\n458\n00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.785\n>> I don't like the new fangled\nmachines you got out here.\n\n459\n00:23:32.785 --> 00:23:34.870\n[LAUGHS]\n>> So yeah you don't want that person.\n\n460\n00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.060\nI know it sounds strange, but it's true.\n\n461\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.980\nYou want the person that has that ability\nto sit and go, you know I don't know\n\n462\n00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.440\neverything about it but I do want to learn\nit and I want that ability to do that.\n\n463\n00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:50.240\nSo you want people that are actually\ntrainable to be able to do that as well.\n\n464\n00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.970\nYou also want people that\nare willing to give you feedback.\n\n465\n00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.867\nThe feedback that you don't want is,\nwhen I say, hey Daniel,\n\n466\n00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:59.328\nhow do you like using this program,\nwhat do you find fascinating about it?\n\n467\n00:23:59.328 --> 00:24:01.581\nAnd then Daniel goes Nothing.\n\n468\n00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:03.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Have you used it?\n\n469\n00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:04.947\nYep.\n\n470\n00:24:04.947 --> 00:24:07.360\nThat's not what you're looking for, right?\n\n471\n00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.350\nYou looking for someone,\n\n472\n00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:12.500\nthat absolutely, when you hear them\ntalk about it, they're gonna really say,\n\n473\n00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.220\nlook here's what I do like about it,\nhere's what I don't like about it.\n\n474\n00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.190\nThat's really important, isn't it?\n\n475\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.350\nWhen we start trying to\ngive people software.\n\n476\n00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.411\n>> Yeah, getting someone who's,\nit's not their fault.\n\n477\n00:24:22.411 --> 00:24:25.529\nIt's not that it's a bad thing,\nthat maybe they're a man of few words, or\n\n478\n00:24:25.529 --> 00:24:26.379\nwoman of few words.\n\n479\n00:24:26.379 --> 00:24:27.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's fine.\n\n480\n00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.730\nBut when we're setting up\na test environment and\n\n481\n00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:34.060\nwe need feedback, it pays to be\na little selective when you're choosing\n\n482\n00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.810\nthose people that are going to give\nyou the feedback that you need, so\n\n483\n00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.010\nthat you can make sure that\neverything is working as expected.\n\n484\n00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.150\nIs there any hiccups?\n\n485\n00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.740\nThings like that.\nWhen you have people\n\n486\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.410\nthat are able to be very verbose,\n\n487\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.860\nand they're urbane, they are able to\nput sentences together that make sense.\n\n488\n00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.776\nThey're gonna point toward good things,\nbad things, and\n\n489\n00:24:50.776 --> 00:24:53.052\nthey're not afraid to speak their mind.\n\n490\n00:24:53.052 --> 00:24:55.480\nThat's gonna help us\nout as administrators,\n\n491\n00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.630\nthat are trying to implement this system.\n\n492\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.280\nSo you do need to, like I said,\n\n493\n00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.190\nbe a little selective like\nRonnie's been talking about.\n\n494\n00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:05.892\nMake sure you get those people that\nare gonna be excited about the product,\n\n495\n00:25:05.892 --> 00:25:09.299\nwhether or not, they go in with no\npreconceived notions of whether or\n\n496\n00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:11.140\nnot they're gonna like it, right?\n\n497\n00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.340\nThey're just excited that we're\ngonna get to use a new product.\n\n498\n00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.395\nI get to be on the cutting edge\nof what my company is doing, and\n\n499\n00:25:17.395 --> 00:25:18.898\nsee where we're gonna take this thing.\n\n500\n00:25:18.898 --> 00:25:21.160\nAnd test out new software,\nit's gonna be fun.\n\n501\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:26.370\nThat's the kind of idea, the mentality and\nin someone who's able to articulate that\n\n502\n00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.580\nback at you, since you understand all\nthe good, and all the bad feedback.\n\n503\n00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:34.210\nAnd then you're gonna be able to write\nthat up and move forward from that point.\n\n504\n00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:34.910\nAm I right, Ronnie?\n\n505\n00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.390\n>> You are right in\nthat very process here.\n\n506\n00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.620\nAnd the other thing that you want,\nof course, is somebody that can actually\n\n507\n00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.490\ngive you feedback,\nin a kind of a very uniform manner.\n\n508\n00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:44.510\nAnd what we mean by that,\n\n509\n00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.900\nis creating what we call\na communication process plan, right?\n\n510\n00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.595\nSo we might send out an email\nonce a week of saying,\n\n511\n00:25:50.595 --> 00:25:54.580\nall right, here's what we want to\nlearn from our pilot users and\n\n512\n00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.480\nmake sure that they're actually\npeople that can give you feedback.\n\n513\n00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.970\nSometimes they don't provide feedback\nbecause they are too busy and\n\n514\n00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.400\nthat's not the exact user that you want.\n\n515\n00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.560\nYou don't want somebody that's so\noverloaded with everything that they're\n\n516\n00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.650\ndoing, that they can't\nprovide you feedback.\n\n517\n00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.940\nBut that person can always give\nfeedback to somebody else, right?\n\n518\n00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.380\nThat absolutely can be trained,\nthat can also be able to use the product.\n\n519\n00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.500\nAnd what they can do, is that they can\nobserve and go, Daniel, I notice that\n\n520\n00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.980\nyou're having to duplicate a lot of\nissues when you use this other program.\n\n521\n00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.140\nDid you know that Office365 might\nbe able to help out in that?\n\n522\n00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.650\nAnd then it peaks their interest like,\nhow's it going to help me out?\n\n523\n00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.830\nWell you want that person\nto actually be the one,\n\n524\n00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.930\nthat is able then to come back and\ngo, well,\n\n525\n00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:37.060\nRonnie, here's what I found out, is that,\nyeah, I do see duplication now that\n\n526\n00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.680\nhere's something that maybe Excel Online\ncan help us out with the collaboration.\n\n527\n00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.330\nWhere Daniel and I can actually get\ntogether on Excel spreadsheet without him\n\n528\n00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:46.968\nsaving it and then him having\nto open it on his computer,\n\n529\n00:26:46.968 --> 00:26:50.260\nmake the changes, closing it out,\nand then I can access it.\n\n530\n00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.664\nBy being able to do that collaboration,\nit would help us out in this program and\n\n531\n00:26:54.664 --> 00:26:57.467\nthen you can continue to expand that out,\nright,\n\n532\n00:26:57.467 --> 00:27:01.703\nby being able to have the right select\ngroup of users in your pilot program.\n\n533\n00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:05.877\nIt will help out especially if you can\nget the people that you, like I said,\n\n534\n00:27:05.877 --> 00:27:09.535\nare trainable that can give you\na clearer plan of communication.\n\n535\n00:27:09.535 --> 00:27:13.739\nNow, don't get me wrong noting in\nanything that we do on Microsoft, right,\n\n536\n00:27:13.739 --> 00:27:15.692\nis geared that you reject it [LAUGH].\n\n537\n00:27:15.692 --> 00:27:19.257\nThere is nothing that we're\ngonna tell you, that we go, no,\n\n538\n00:27:19.257 --> 00:27:20.636\nyou don't wanna do it.\n\n539\n00:27:20.636 --> 00:27:25.064\nBut I hate to say it, you might find\nout during the pilot program, okay,\n\n540\n00:27:25.064 --> 00:27:29.709\nthat nobody in your pick or process\nhere says, hey, yeah, we don't see any\n\n541\n00:27:29.709 --> 00:27:34.750\nother benefit with, it don't look\nlike it's gonna be any good to us.\n\n542\n00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.000\nHopefully that's not gonna happen.\n\n543\n00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.520\nAnd that's not what\nMicrosoft wants to happen.\n\n544\n00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.300\nIt's not what anybody wants to happen.\n\n545\n00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.080\nBut it may be, right?\n\n546\n00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.120\nBut that's why when you\npick the people don't\n\n547\n00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.480\njust pick the least busy group of people,\ndon't pick the most busy group of people.\n\n548\n00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.320\nYou want to pick the people that\nare representative of your company,\n\n549\n00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.540\nthat they're always gonna be that\nprocess that you want to do, okay?\n\n550\n00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.190\nNow once you actually decide that, right,\n\n551\n00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:02.270\nyou want to again like I said about that\n5%, that's what Microsoft recommends.\n\n552\n00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.720\nBut once you have that you just go\nahead and start entering them in.\n\n553\n00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.540\nLet me show you a couple of different\nways that we can do this, okay?\n\n554\n00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.870\nSo at the beginning here, so\nhere it is on my machine.\n\n555\n00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.880\nWhat we wanna do is we wanna\ntake a look here, okay.\n\n556\n00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.040\nSo inside of the Office 365 admin center,\n\n557\n00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.380\nwe wanna go to where it says Users, and\nthen of course, Active Users, okay.\n\n558\n00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:27.610\nThere's several ways that this can\nbe done and it's fairly simple.\n\n559\n00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:31.270\nThe easiest way is right here,\nyou click on this plus sign, and\n\n560\n00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:36.080\nI can't say that, you click on the plus\nsign and we start to add in a user.\n\n561\n00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.420\nDaniel Lowrie, it actually helps\nwhen I put on my glasses so\n\n562\n00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.820\nI can actually see what\nI'm typing in here.\n\n563\n00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:46.019\nAnd then we're gonna add in Daniel, oops.\n\n564\n00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.120\n>> You're right,\nI was getting ready to praise your typing.\n\n565\n00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.490\n>> I know, you can't do that,\ndon't do that.\n\n566\n00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.530\nI'll get a big head.\n\n567\n00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.210\nAnd [LAUGH] so, we'll do that.\n\n568\n00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.040\nAnd then, I'm not gonna worry about\nchanging the password right now\n\n569\n00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.960\ncuz I'm just gonna create this account.\n\n570\n00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:04.060\nAnd for this one,\nwe'll just add in Daniel, oops.\n\n571\n00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.398\nAnd then I simply click Create and\nthat's really it, that [LAUGH] is,\n\n572\n00:29:10.398 --> 00:29:11.890\npretty much, it.\n\n573\n00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.740\nNow, in a small organization,\nthat's the way we're gonna go, and\n\n574\n00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.380\nyou see what it actually does.\n\n575\n00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.350\nIt creates this information right here,\nand when it does that,\n\n576\n00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:25.020\nnotice that it actually gives a username\nright here, as well as just a a password\n\n577\n00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.440\nand then the license that they're actually\nassigned and then you can click Close.\n\n578\n00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.020\nAnd that will add in that next user for\nus.\n\n579\n00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.880\nNow what if you have multiple users?\n\n580\n00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.420\nLet's say that in a small organization\nthis is the way to do it,\n\n581\n00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.920\nmanually one at a time.\n\n582\n00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.704\nBut if your organization is big and\nit's gigantic,\n\n583\n00:29:42.704 --> 00:29:48.639\nlet's say it's 500 users 5% of that\n500 would be 25 I believe is right.\n\n584\n00:29:48.639 --> 00:29:53.446\nIf 50 is 10% of 500,\n5% of that would be 25, okay?\n\n585\n00:29:53.446 --> 00:29:58.428\nIf I have 25 users, Daniel do you want to\nactually click on a plus sign 25 times and\n\n586\n00:29:58.428 --> 00:29:59.420\nenter in names?\n\n587\n00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.180\n>> Heck yeah!\n\n588\n00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:00.855\nNo, no i don't.\n\n589\n00:30:00.855 --> 00:30:02.320\n[LAUGHS]\n>> Yeah,\n\n590\n00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.590\nmost of us would not want to do that.\n\n591\n00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:10.090\nSo there is a way, okay,\nthat if you have a CSV file, okay,\n\n592\n00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:14.280\nof those users which I don't here but\n>> That's a very common format for\n\n593\n00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.640\nimporting and a long list of things.\n\n594\n00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.990\nEspecially when it has multiple different,\nlike a first name and last name, right?\n\n595\n00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.500\n>> Yeah.\n\n596\n00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.010\nSo all you have to do is click on this.\n\n597\n00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:27.160\nYou click on that and that's the bulk\nadd and from here you just go ahead and\n\n598\n00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.550\ngive the name of that file.\n\n599\n00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.430\nAnd if they are that\ncomma separated value,\n\n600\n00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.000\nwhich is again like Daniel would explain,\n\n601\n00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.800\npretty common format, well all you do\nis you click Next, and there you go.\n\n602\n00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.830\nYou can actually add those\nusers in that way too and\n\n603\n00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.820\nthat would be the next step\nthat you could continue to do.\n\n604\n00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.790\nSo those are gonna be the ones\nthat we use in the pilot program.\n\n605\n00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:48.120\nNow when we get ready for deployment and\nwe go look, we're gonna move everybody\n\n606\n00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.400\nover to it, there's a way that you can\ndo an Active Directory synchronization.\n\n607\n00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.510\nNow we're not getting that right now\ncuz that's gonna come later on, but\n\n608\n00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.270\nthere's a way we can see,\n\n609\n00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:01.380\nall right, you mean I can take my\nentire Active Directory and do this?\n\n610\n00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.140\nYes, okay, you can.\n\n611\n00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.710\nAnd Active Directory synchronization\nwill help you to do that\n\n612\n00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:08.570\nonce you get everything set up right.\n\n613\n00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.860\nSo doing that ID fix is preparing for\nthe future.\n\n614\n00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.032\nRight now we're in the pilot stage.\n\n615\n00:31:13.032 --> 00:31:17.560\nWe're either gonna do that bulk CSV add or\nwe're gonna actually do it one at a time\n\n616\n00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.230\nand when we do so we'll go ahead and\nadd those directly in there and\n\n617\n00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:26.630\nof course that means each one these,\nyou can actually select them, oops.\n\n618\n00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.070\nSo I selected Daniel.\n\n619\n00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:32.050\nAnd then over on the right hand side,\nnotice I can reset his password,\n\n620\n00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.690\nwe can edit his user role,\nadd him to a group.\n\n621\n00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.680\nYou name it, we can even go ahead and\nstart doing that if we wanted to create\n\n622\n00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.140\ntest groups to say, hey, Daniel is\npart of the host group, okay, and\n\n623\n00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.560\nI wanna create a host group and see what\nI can do with a host and do that too.\n\n624\n00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.810\nWe can of course edit the user role.\n\n625\n00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:52.760\nIf I select that option, notice I can do\nthe delegated like custom administrator\n\n626\n00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.620\nif I want to and say,\nDaniel is responsible for Exchange.\n\n627\n00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.300\nAnd that way, Daniel can go into\nOffice 365 and start taking\n\n628\n00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.080\na look at the exchange console if we\nwanted him to do something like that.\n\n629\n00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.370\nSo, it is very possible for\nyou to do that as well.\n\n630\n00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:13.000\nSo being able to get that set up,\nright, now allows your initial group of\n\n631\n00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.530\nusers to be able to start working with\nOffice 365 in the environment they\n\n632\n00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:22.600\nwould be working with it if the entire\norganization had flipped over, okay.\n\n633\n00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.450\nIn other words,\nwe really had to change them out.\n\n634\n00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.860\nSo you're not saying, well,\nthis is just a test environment.\n\n635\n00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.460\nIt doesn't matter if things are broken or\nnot.\n\n636\n00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.550\nNo, you want them now to do what?\n\n637\n00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.710\nBreak it.\nTry, and do everything that they can,\n\n638\n00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.400\nas they would normally use this, and go,\nno, your email is gonna come through here,\n\n639\n00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.390\nand we'll talk about that, and\ngetting that set up a little bit.\n\n640\n00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.530\nBut, right now, that's what you wanna do,\nis that anything that the test\n\n641\n00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.490\nenvironment's gonna do, is gonna be,\nactually, good for your later, and\n\n642\n00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.580\nthat means we don't have to, actually,\nflip Daniel's account over again and\n\n643\n00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:55.590\nnow that he's actually receiving real\nemails and he's part of everything else\n\n644\n00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.580\nthat's going on and go, oh, Daniel,\nsorry we did that for a test.\n\n645\n00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.600\nWe're gonna have to do that again.\n\n646\n00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.060\nAnd you're like, are you joking?\n\n647\n00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.650\n>> It doesn't theoretically work,\nit actually works at this point.\n\n648\n00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:10.030\n>> Yeah, and so everything is just about\nworking once you have the user set up.\n\n649\n00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.760\nThere's still a few things\nthat we have to do but\n\n650\n00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.948\nit looks like you let me\ntalk too long again, Daniel.\n\n651\n00:33:13.948 --> 00:33:14.620\n>> I did Ronnie.\n\n652\n00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.220\nThe sound of your voice,\nI just get captivated and\n\n653\n00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.160\nthen we look at the clock and\nit's all gone, all the time is gone.\n\n654\n00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.860\nBut that's good cuz that means we\ncan make a part three for this and\n\n655\n00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.670\nwe can spend all the time we want on that.\n\n656\n00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.285\nAnd hopefully,\nyou guys will enjoy that as well.\n\n657\n00:33:26.285 --> 00:33:28.270\nRonnie, thank you so\nmuch for this episode.\n\n658\n00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:31.010\nWe look forward to episode three and\nhopefully you do as well.\n\n659\n00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.710\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n660\n00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:35.530\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n661\n00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.015\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n662\n00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:42.110\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.420\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, yes,\n\n4\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.290\nwe are continuing on with our Managing\nOffice 365 Identities and Requirements.\n\n5\n00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.150\nand I did get that correct,\nthank you, Ronnie.\n\n6\n00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.380\nI see you over there laughing at me.\n\n7\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.590\nObviously joining us today is\nnone other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.060\nRonnie, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.180\n>> Thank you.\nIt's a great day to be right here as we\n\n10\n00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.268\ncontinue on taking a look at preparing and\nplanning our pilot for Office 365.\n\n11\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.400\nRemember that as we talk about\nactually implementing this pilot,\n\n12\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.130\nwe're really getting everything ready for\nan actual deployment, but\n\n13\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.810\nwe're also doing the testing\nat the same time.\n\n14\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.090\nWe've looked at in previous episodes of\ncourse the Office readiness checks, or\n\n15\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.160\nthe Office 365 readiness checks.\n\n16\n00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.570\nWe've also talked about using\nsomething like the ID fix.\n\n17\n00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.850\nMake sure you check out\nthose episodes as well.\n\n18\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.106\nAnd selecting the correct pilot users that\nwe also want to have available to us cuz\n\n19\n00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.230\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n20\n00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.420\nNow once we get that up and we've got\nnow users inside of our Office 365, and\n\n21\n00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.670\nlet's say that we also have our\nactive directory environment and\n\n22\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.090\nthey also have Exchange running so\nthey're also using email there.\n\n23\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.745\nWell we want to go ahead and get it set\nup to where essentially you're going to\n\n24\n00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:28.630\nhave your pilot users get their\nemails through Office 365.\n\n25\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.920\nNow, I've got it set up to a point that\nwe can do the majority of this, but\n\n26\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.710\nI don't have my test demo here actually\nconnected to the Internet to be able\n\n27\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.470\nto relay email messages.\n\n28\n00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.255\nSo there's a portion of it we won't do but\n\n29\n00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:42.310\nwe want to show you as\nmuch as we can here.\n\n30\n00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.400\nBecause it is a central part\nof getting it connected right.\n\n31\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.770\nSo if you want your pilot users\nto really do everything, right?\n\n32\n00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.510\nWe don't want to actually limit them\nto just the ability to be able to\n\n33\n00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.570\nwork with Office 365 in terms of\nthe online collaboration that they can do,\n\n34\n00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.320\nand of course,\ninstall Office on their computers.\n\n35\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.180\nWe really want them to have the full\neffect of how it really is almost\n\n36\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.720\na seamless transition for\ntheir emails as well.\n\n37\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.500\nSo that means that there's a little bit of\nsetup that has to be done on both ends.\n\n38\n00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.440\nWe need to be able to set up when we\nneed to on our Exchange server inside\n\n39\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.640\nof our own environment.\n\n40\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.790\nWe need to also go over to the Office\n365 administration console and\n\n41\n00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.750\nset up what we need to there.\n\n42\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.130\nSo we want to make sure that we get\nthese steps at least to that point\n\n43\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.020\nright where we need to and then once we\ndo that we'll see that for the end users.\n\n44\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.895\nIt really is fairly seamless, that all\nthey'll need to do is log in to Office\n\n45\n00:02:35.895 --> 00:02:40.160\n365, open up Outlook and actually\nconnect on a connected account and\n\n46\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.410\ntheir email messages will probably start\nrelaying right in once that's done.\n\n47\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.720\nWe're not so worried about that there.\n\n48\n00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.490\nThat's the user experience part.\n\n49\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.670\nWhat we wanna do is show you\nthe Exchange side and also going in to\n\n50\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.400\nthe Office 365 admin, so this is one\nof those more important concepts.\n\n51\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.720\nThe nice thing is,\nonce you get it set up for\n\n52\n00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.520\nyour test user,\nyou're not having to tear it down again.\n\n53\n00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.170\nI know I keep emphasising that point, but\nthat's what we would normally do, right?\n\n54\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.160\nAnd in a situation where we're actually\ndeploying in this, well it works fine, but\n\n55\n00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.010\nwe weren't actually thinking about setting\nit up for the entire organization,\n\n56\n00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.340\nso we would have picked\na different domain name.\n\n57\n00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.010\nWe would have actually set up,\n\n58\n00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.210\nwe wouldn't have setup our DNS records\nthe way that we would need to set them up.\n\n59\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.020\nBut with Office 365,\nas we're doing this for the pilot,\n\n60\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.590\nif we've already setup everything\nthat we needed to such as the domain.\n\n61\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.290\nAs well as everything else, it's gonna\nmake a lot easier transition not only for\n\n62\n00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.070\nyour pilot users to be able to connect in\nbut later on as you add in more users.\n\n63\n00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.170\nYou already got it set up.\n\n64\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.660\nSo that's the key, is making sure that\nwe understand what's going on here.\n\n65\n00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.663\nSo let's verify and\n\n66\n00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:45.857\nmake sure that we understand what\nwe have to actually do, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:50.043\nSo remember that when we set up for\nOffice 365 here,\n\n68\n00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:53.410\nlet me get back to my Office 365 account.\n\n69\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.740\nI've got my Exchange console,\nbut let me go back over here.\n\n70\n00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.350\nSo, here it is.\n\n71\n00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.610\nI'm working on the server and\n\n72\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.070\njust going to use this\nconnection then to help us out.\n\n73\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.596\nSo, when we first set this up, the key\nelement again, and you'll hear this\n\n74\n00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:13.431\nthroughout the episodes, is making sure\nthat custom domain is set up properly.\n\n75\n00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:17.298\nSo remember that when we do something like\nthis, if we are actually setting it up,\n\n76\n00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:20.110\nwe can either use the setup and\nwalk through it step by step.\n\n77\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.230\nOr what we actually did in previous\nepisodes where we provisioned our tenant\n\n78\n00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.100\nis to click on Domains and\nfrom that point, we select Add Domain and\n\n79\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.360\nthat brings us to that same wizard.\n\n80\n00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.600\nWhere what it's gonna do, it's gonna\nverify that we own that domain name.\n\n81\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.720\nAnd once we create that text record,\n\n82\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.910\nand we put in into our DNS register,\nit actually says we do own it.\n\n83\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.350\nAnd then we select what the purpose of our\ndomain is going to be, whether it's gonna\n\n84\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.960\nuse from Microsoft Exchange, either\nthe SharePoint or the Skype for Business.\n\n85\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.060\nI was trying to remember what\nI was talking about there.\n\n86\n00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.060\nSkype for Business, once we have that set\nup, Office 365's gonna generate multiple\n\n87\n00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.510\nrecords for each one of those services for\nus to enter into our DNS register.\n\n88\n00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.440\nOnce we're done with that, and\n\n89\n00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.060\nthe majority of it is actually done and\nover with.\n\n90\n00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.380\nAnd that's all we really need to\ndo except for one other record,\n\n91\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.440\nwhich is our SPF record there\nthat we also need to set up.\n\n92\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.690\nBut if it's actually already set up for\nus, in other words,\n\n93\n00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.590\nwe actually copied all that\ninformation in from previously.\n\n94\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.390\nWe only need to modify just one other\nthing inside of our DNS records and\n\n95\n00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.790\nwe'll be ready to go.\n\n96\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.340\nSo I don't wanna go through the entire\nprocess again of setting up our domain.\n\n97\n00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.340\nBut remember that this is where we took\noff this onmicrosoft.com and then I\n\n98\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.750\nwas able to select data1 and now all my\nusers are gonna be registered that way.\n\n99\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.590\nSo that is kind of the first step,\n\n100\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.690\nright, is that the DMS servers\nare set up the way that we need to.\n\n101\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.100\nNow once they're done, okay,\nthen we can go to our Exchange console.\n\n102\n00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.540\nNow, this Exchange console's\na little bit different\n\n103\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.700\nbecause we are actually\nworking in Exchange 2016.\n\n104\n00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.090\nAnd if you've gotten to the Exchange\nadministration center inside of your\n\n105\n00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.190\nwhatever version of Exchange that you're\nworking on, that' perfectly fine.\n\n106\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.360\nOkay, so what do we wanna do?\n\n107\n00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.200\nWe wanna go ahead and add in,\nif we actually don't have Mailbox.\n\n108\n00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.900\nLet's say that one of our pilot\nusers is not actually in this list.\n\n109\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.620\nFor these mailboxes,\nI just set this Exchange server up.\n\n110\n00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.750\nI simply click on the plus sign, and\nI'm gonna do a new user mailbox.\n\n111\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.440\nAnd from this point,\nI'm gonna browse to an existing user and\n\n112\n00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.480\nI'm gonna add in Daniel here and click OK.\n\n113\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.810\nAnd when I do that, it's gonna pull it\nfrom Active Directory and it's gonna\n\n114\n00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.190\ncreate a mailbox essentially for\nDaniel's account here in just a moment.\n\n115\n00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.230\nSo once his mailbox is created and\nthis is where you actually have a list\n\n116\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.430\nof all the people that you'll have here,\nright?\n\n117\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.190\nSo inside of your entire Exchange server,\nyou wanna select all of your pilot users\n\n118\n00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.600\nand from your pilot users,\nyou want to be able to go in there and\n\n119\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.290\nchange just a couple of things\nthat need to be changed.\n\n120\n00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.090\nSo in earlier versions,\nyou might right click on the name, and\n\n121\n00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.060\ngo down to properties and that would bring\nup the property sheet for that mailbox.\n\n122\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.340\nBut in this 2016 version,\n\n123\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.360\nYou have to use this list over\nhere on the right hand side.\n\n124\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.080\nAnd what we're actually doing is,\nwe're scrolling down here, and\n\n125\n00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.720\nwe are looking for\nwhere it says a few different things.\n\n126\n00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.800\nLet me see if it's not right.\n\n127\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.490\nAnd you know I'm telling\nyou the wrong place.\n\n128\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.470\nI need to edit his account here.\n\n129\n00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.760\nSo all I have to do is click on his name.\n\n130\n00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.860\nAnd there's no right click, so\nthat's why I'm doing this, and\n\n131\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.730\nI click on the little pencil,\nand this is where I needed to go.\n\n132\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.740\nSo this actually gives me all of\nthe properties, and details that we need.\n\n133\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.290\nNow, I wanna click on this More Options\nright here, and, as I scroll down,\n\n134\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.280\nlet me see if I actually have the right\ninformation here of mailbox usage,\n\n135\n00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.049\nor, oops.\n\n136\n00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.227\nOh, it's the mailbox features, see,\n\n137\n00:07:50.227 --> 00:07:52.538\nI always forget which one\nis mailbox features here.\n\n138\n00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:55.247\nAnd what we're looking to do is\nwe're actually looking to change\n\n139\n00:07:55.247 --> 00:07:56.090\na couple of things.\n\n140\n00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.873\nFor Daniel as a user, I wanna make\nsure that IMAP is actually enabled.\n\n141\n00:08:00.873 --> 00:08:03.023\nAnd this one actually is, so in 2013,\n\n142\n00:08:03.023 --> 00:08:05.670\nI don't know if it's\nactually enabled by default.\n\n143\n00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.840\nIf not, you wanna make sure that\nIMAP is actually enabled here for\n\n144\n00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.430\nthat individual user.\n\n145\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.170\nFor each one of the pilot users,\n\n146\n00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.350\nyou wanna make sure that that is actually\na connection that is gonna be done.\n\n147\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.300\nNow the other thing that we want\nis gonna be under mail flow, so\n\n148\n00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.022\nevery pilot user, then right?\n\n149\n00:08:26.022 --> 00:08:29.880\nWe're gonna ensure that they can actually\nuse IMAP is what to want to do and\n\n150\n00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.550\nthen for the entire exchange server,\nI'm going to click on mail flow.\n\n151\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.180\nAnd, under mail flow, I also want\nwhere it says accepted domains, so\n\n152\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.110\nremember that if you're\non the Exchange 2013.\n\n153\n00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.320\nMake sure you follow those\nsteps through there, and\n\n154\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.860\nnotice that currently it says that\nthe domain type is authoritative.\n\n155\n00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.440\nAnd if I click on the little\npencil to edit that entry,\n\n156\n00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.690\nit says this accepted\ndomain is authoritative.\n\n157\n00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:02.850\nEmail is delivered only to valid\nrecipients in this exchange organizations,\n\n158\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.650\nall email for\n\n159\n00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.670\nunknown recipients is rejected,\nthere's also these two other options.\n\n160\n00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.634\nInternal relay, emails delivered to\nrecipients in this exchange organization\n\n161\n00:09:13.634 --> 00:09:17.430\nare relayed to an email server\nat another physical location or\n\n162\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.499\nlogical location, or\nthere's an external one.\n\n163\n00:09:20.499 --> 00:09:24.990\nEmail is rejected to an email server\nat another physical location.\n\n164\n00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:31.110\nBecause we are actually gonna use this\nemail server to become a relay to Office\n\n165\n00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:36.060\n365's email server, we wanna make sure\nthat we select this internal relay here.\n\n166\n00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.240\nSo that is what this particular\nemail server is going to do, so\n\n167\n00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.730\nlet me go ahead and click save here.\n\n168\n00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.550\nAnd when I do that it is possible\nthat this name may not change very\n\n169\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.865\nquickly so\nyou do have to be careful there as well.\n\n170\n00:09:55.865 --> 00:09:59.996\nBut this thing should still be able\nto send out emails even as you're\n\n171\n00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:03.703\ndoing this right now but\nthis is what you want to be able to do.\n\n172\n00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:08.219\nSo once you have that set up, your now\ngoing to be able to forward emails,\n\n173\n00:10:08.219 --> 00:10:12.218\nat least for those picker users\nonce we go over to Office 365,\n\n174\n00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:14.630\nout to Office 365 as well.\n\n175\n00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.454\nSo, we want that internal relay to\nactually be set up the way that we want,\n\n176\n00:10:18.454 --> 00:10:22.280\nso remember it may just take a little\nbit of time before this switches, and\n\n177\n00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.354\nyou do need to wait.\n\n178\n00:10:23.354 --> 00:10:28.100\nDon't go and jump back over to\nOffice 365 yet if you do that.\n\n179\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.300\nNow the other thing that you may\nalso want to pay attention to,\n\n180\n00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.520\ndepending on some of the different\nthings that are actually set up here,\n\n181\n00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.820\nis that there is a spam protection, and\nyou may actually have to set up some\n\n182\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.220\ndifferent rules that you\nhave to worry about.\n\n183\n00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:47.240\nSo if you do have different rules that\ndon't allow you to do certain things, make\n\n184\n00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.880\nsure you actually take a look if there's\nany other rules that may be blocking that.\n\n185\n00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.890\nSo do be careful about that as well, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.889\nSo if you were over here and\nyou had rules you might wanna see,\n\n187\n00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.910\nhere's also the Exchange protection\noption that they also have.\n\n188\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.800\nThe Exchange online\nprotection is here as well,\n\n189\n00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.860\nthere's other additional rules\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n190\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.470\nMine doesn't have anything,\nit's got the lowest priority so\n\n191\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.500\nI'm not worried about anything here.\n\n192\n00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.260\nBut if you do have multiple ones,\n\n193\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.770\nmake sure you be careful here\nif everything's not working.\n\n194\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.370\nSo check out either the mail flow rules or\n\n195\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.950\nalso the protection rules that may\nprevent something from happening too.\n\n196\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:30.130\nAll right, now once we've got that done,\nthis is where the end of my\n\n197\n00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:36.020\nprocess really doesn't work anymore,\nnow you have to go and you set this up.\n\n198\n00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.300\nIf we have the external side of my\nexchange server setup, right, and\n\n199\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.140\nthen there's a public IP address on it,\nand then I have my DNS record set up\n\n200\n00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.220\nto be able to relay it here,\nusing that split-brain DNS.\n\n201\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.100\nThen we would be ready to go.\n\n202\n00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.700\nBut the very fact is that I\ndon't have a public IP address,\n\n203\n00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.620\nI don't have split-brain DNS set up to\nmake sure that everything's working.\n\n204\n00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.280\nBut that's what you want on\nthis exchange side of it, okay.\n\n205\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.809\nSo once that is done and\n\n206\n00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:05.684\nif I did have the public IP\naddress I would need to go to my.\n\n207\n00:12:08.982 --> 00:12:15.575\nExternal DNS here, hover.com and\nthen I would need to log in here and\n\n208\n00:12:15.575 --> 00:12:23.088\nadd in some of the additional records\nthat I would need, and we are doing that.\n\n209\n00:12:23.088 --> 00:12:27.410\nNow the problem that I have here is that\nthis one is not actually connected in to\n\n210\n00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.135\naccept my credentials, so\nlet me change up here just briefly, and\n\n211\n00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:32.620\nthen I can do it from here.\n\n212\n00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:39.118\nI've got everything set up on LastPass for\nme to sign in, so if I don't have that,\n\n213\n00:12:39.118 --> 00:12:40.347\nthen I can't sign in.\n\n214\n00:12:43.308 --> 00:12:44.712\nOh, of course, why would it?\n\n215\n00:12:47.626 --> 00:12:50.227\nAll right, let's see, maybe I can't.\n\n216\n00:12:53.686 --> 00:12:54.303\nThere we go.\n\n217\n00:12:54.303 --> 00:12:56.415\n>> There it is.\n>> Just took a moment here, so\n\n218\n00:12:56.415 --> 00:12:59.247\nmy clicking apparently was overly-\n>> Zealous.\n\n219\n00:12:59.247 --> 00:13:00.455\n>> Zealous.\n\n220\n00:13:00.455 --> 00:13:03.206\nSo I'm going to click on account and DNS.\n\n221\n00:13:07.014 --> 00:13:10.606\nAll right now there's a couple of ways\nthat you can handle what we're about to\n\n222\n00:13:10.606 --> 00:13:11.330\nshow you here.\n\n223\n00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.740\nSo this text record\ndown here at the bottom\n\n224\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.110\nis what we're taking\na look at as well okay?\n\n225\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:24.300\nSo when we take a look at this particular\nrecord, notice what I have here and\n\n226\n00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.320\nthis is what we want to make\nsure that we include in.\n\n227\n00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:34.570\nIt says, include itprotvdemo.com, so what\nis this record actually helping us to do?\n\n228\n00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.690\nThis record as we actually have\nupdated our DNS records, this is\n\n229\n00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.900\nactually allowing us to be able to use\nthat SPF record is what it's going to do.\n\n230\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.250\nNow, I could have created one, I could\nhave manually created an SPF record but\n\n231\n00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.290\nif I already have this record that I\ncreated, I don't have to go in and\n\n232\n00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.000\nmanually create a whole another one.\n\n233\n00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.290\nI simply add in this line that says,\ninclude the name of my domain.com\n\n234\n00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:05.240\nright in front of the Office Exchange,\nthe Office 365 Exchange as well.\n\n235\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.020\nAnd that will allow for all those settings\nto take place on my DNS registrar as well\n\n236\n00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:15.490\nas the external exchange server\nthat everything is connected in and\n\n237\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.690\nthat we can actually forward our emails\nfrom internally, also out externally,\n\n238\n00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.630\nallow the external to come\nin to wherever it needs to.\n\n239\n00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.435\nSo this SPF record is really\nhelping us out if we're\n\n240\n00:14:27.435 --> 00:14:30.894\nactually doing this the way\nthat we need to go.\n\n241\n00:14:30.894 --> 00:14:37.057\nNow if you don't have one of course, it\nmeans you have create Windows SPF records\n\n242\n00:14:37.057 --> 00:14:43.260\nand this is where you go back into the\ndomain management inside of Office 365.\n\n243\n00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.031\nLet me go back over here and\nget to the right one.\n\n244\n00:14:50.212 --> 00:14:55.457\nNow let me see if I got, come on,\nit's not letting me click on the,\n\n245\n00:14:55.457 --> 00:14:58.849\nthere we go, Office Portal, there we go.\n\n246\n00:14:58.849 --> 00:15:01.906\nThis is where you go back\ninto the office portal, and\n\n247\n00:15:01.906 --> 00:15:06.213\nwhere you go back into domains, and\nthen you tell it, you go ahead and say I\n\n248\n00:15:06.213 --> 00:15:11.009\nwanna generate those same records again\nfor the purpose of the Exchange server and\n\n249\n00:15:11.009 --> 00:15:14.066\nit will show you what that\nSPF record is gonna be, and\n\n250\n00:15:14.066 --> 00:15:17.506\nthen you copy that in and\nthen you add in that domain again.\n\n251\n00:15:17.506 --> 00:15:20.299\nSo there's a couple of things that\nyou may have to do depending on what\n\n252\n00:15:20.299 --> 00:15:21.750\nthe setup actually is.\n\n253\n00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.450\nAll right, so\nonce everything is actually done,\n\n254\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:29.200\nat that particular point\nin what we need to do.\n\n255\n00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.150\nHere on my Office 365 portal,\nI'm gonna select the active users, and\n\n256\n00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.080\nyou'll notice here's Daniel's account.\n\n257\n00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.020\nNow, if I had already created\nDaniel's account before,\n\n258\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.110\nI had gotten that connected in.\n\n259\n00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.650\nRemember what would have happened\nhere is that Daniel's original\n\n260\n00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:50.605\naccount would've showed up as\nitprotvdemo.onMicrosoft.com okay?\n\n261\n00:15:50.605 --> 00:15:53.312\nThat's what would normally have happened,\n\n262\n00:15:53.312 --> 00:15:58.152\nnow even though I've done the Exchange\nserver side and I created my DNS records,\n\n263\n00:15:58.152 --> 00:16:02.870\nwhat I would normally have done Is at this\npoint here is I would edit his record.\n\n264\n00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.900\nIf it still said that\nthat on Microsoft.com\n\n265\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.850\nis it's down here now that\neverything it actually created.\n\n266\n00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.890\nHere's those two options that we have.\n\n267\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.450\nOne says ITProTV demo on Microsoft.com.\n\n268\n00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.350\nThat would have been the default\nif I had created it before, right?\n\n269\n00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:25.460\nThen when I added in that\ndomain that I added in there\n\n270\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:30.680\nit automatically changed it for me,\nbut to make sure that it is actually\n\n271\n00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.910\nconnected to the Exchange Server I simply\nneed to change the domain name here, and\n\n272\n00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.970\nthen click Save, and\nthat will also do this for me.\n\n273\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.600\nNow it actually says it's going\nto take up to 24 hours for\n\n274\n00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.320\nthis change inside of Office 365.\n\n275\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:44.850\nPerfectly fine.\n\n276\n00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.940\nIt may not take that long at all,\nbut from that point on, right?\n\n277\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:54.397\nIf my DNS records inside of my public DNS\nregistrar are set up the way that they\n\n278\n00:16:54.397 --> 00:16:59.766\nneed to be, if I made the modifications\ninternally on my Exchange Server by\n\n279\n00:16:59.766 --> 00:17:05.220\nchanging it to that internal relay,\nby making sure that each of the accounts\n\n280\n00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:10.240\ncan actually do at least for\nthe purpose of this demo an iMap, right?\n\n281\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.530\nWe get that connection done, then if all\nthat was actually set up where it was\n\n282\n00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:19.180\nalready being able to relay emails and\nstuff like that, or on Office 365.\n\n283\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.580\nNow all those records\nare actually in place.\n\n284\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:26.410\nNow I just simply make sure that\neach one of these pilot users\n\n285\n00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.530\nthe domain names are actually the same.\n\n286\n00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.290\nOnce that's all set up at that point,\n\n287\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.870\nwell all we have to do is now go ahead and\nset up their Outlook account.\n\n288\n00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.860\nOnce they actually log in to Outlook\n365 here they go and check their\n\n289\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.820\nOutlook at that point they're the ones\nthat can then connect their email, so\n\n290\n00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.400\nthat what should happen now\nis that they receive email to\n\n291\n00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.380\nthe ITProTV demo on Microsoft.com\nit should still relay here.\n\n292\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.310\nIf they get internal email from inside of\nour organization it should also be able to\n\n293\n00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.850\nconnect out here to Outlook.com, and\ndo everything else that we need to.\n\n294\n00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:07.540\nThere's still a couple of steps that we\nneed to connect in from the end user side,\n\n295\n00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.360\nbut we're not there yet.\n\n296\n00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.880\nWe're just talking about\nthe basic infrastructure.\n\n297\n00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.290\nLater on in our series we'll talk about\nthat other side of that connection\n\n298\n00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.670\nwhere we do show using the connected\naccounts making sure that email can\n\n299\n00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.470\nrelay all the way through, and\nof course at that point you test it out.\n\n300\n00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:27.380\nYou verify that email of course is\nflowing, you verify that you can send\n\n301\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.720\nan email between internal and external,\nand once that's done it's ready to go.\n\n302\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.250\nSo they're not the most complex steps in\nthe world, but it is kind of a back and\n\n303\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.360\nforth as we're first doing it, right?\n\n304\n00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.480\nSo remember that that's\nwhere the key comes in.\n\n305\n00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.550\nExchange Server.\n\n306\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.150\nGet that set up, that internal relay.\n\n307\n00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.930\nMake sure that every pilot user then\nhas where they're iMap's enabled.\n\n308\n00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.390\nNow you can use different\nprotocols if you want to, but\n\n309\n00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:56.450\nI just use iMap as just an example of\nwhat we actually want enabled there.\n\n310\n00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:01.030\nAnd then for that point your DNS\nregistration record makes sure the SPF\n\n311\n00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.360\nrecord is there, make sure you already\nset up your domain and Office 365,\n\n312\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.210\nand then you go to Office 365 verify that\n\n313\n00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.340\nthe domain name is the same as\nwhat your domain name actually is.\n\n314\n00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:16.910\nThe one that you own, and you are at\nleast right there ready to go for\n\n315\n00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:21.880\nthat account to be able to do that, and\nthen like I said at the end you get\n\n316\n00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.960\nyour user to log on, you get Outlook\nto actually use the connected account.\n\n317\n00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.260\nFrom that point their\nemail should now flow.\n\n318\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.450\nThey should be ready to go.\n\n319\n00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.230\n>> Awesome.\nNow Ronny,\n\n320\n00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:35.250\nit sounds like what you're saying is that\nwe setup an internal Exchange Server\n\n321\n00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:39.320\nnot to actually process the mail,\nbut just as a relay,\n\n322\n00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.250\nand it's relaying that to\nthe Office 365 Exchange system, and\n\n323\n00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.670\nthat's where our clients connect,\nand everything works.\n\n324\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.710\nAnd does that work the same\nway as well if we already had\n\n325\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.550\nan Exchange Server on premise or\nas a part of our network?\n\n326\n00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.880\nThat now becomes a relay server and\nOffice takes over?\n\n327\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.880\n>> Right.\n\n328\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.030\nThat's exactly what will also end up\nhappening if you already got it set up.\n\n329\n00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.580\nYou take one of those Exchange Servers,\nand that's what you end up doing is you're\n\n330\n00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.480\nallowed to become that internal relay for\nyou, and then everything gets relayed out\n\n331\n00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.980\nthat way instead of actually becoming\nyour authoritative Exchange Server.\n\n332\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.900\nSo there is going to be a point in time\nwhere you do have to kind of configure and\n\n333\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.320\nfigure out which of these servers\nyou're gonna do it on, but\n\n334\n00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.450\nat least for our demonstration for\nthat one those are kinda the basic steps.\n\n335\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.330\nI really do wish that I had that public\nIP address that I was actually relaying\n\n336\n00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.920\nemails so that we could do it, but\n\n337\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.040\nat this point here those are the steps\nat least you need to know about.\n\n338\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.040\nMake sure you understand that those three\nelements are involved in what needs to be\n\n339\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.970\ndone if you're gonna be forwarding\nemails through Exchange Online.\n\n340\n00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.540\nOnce you get that working, right.\n\n341\n00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.890\nNow your pilot users and\neverything that they do, right?\n\n342\n00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:50.300\nThey're not gonna be relying on\nyour internal email server anymore.\n\n343\n00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.870\nThey're now gonna be having their\nemails essentially sent and\n\n344\n00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.610\nalso received through that online\nExchange Server for you, and\n\n345\n00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:03.490\nso everything for at least your pilot\nusers for email and then for them\n\n346\n00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.860\nusing the Office Productivity Suite it'll\nall be actually through Office Online,\n\n347\n00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.660\nand so you now have within hours if\nyou're willing to take the time.\n\n348\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.970\nYour pilot's set up, and\nthat's pretty darn neat, right?\n\n349\n00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.110\nIt's not that you're testing\neverything out yet, right?\n\n350\n00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:24.630\nBut at least the initial setup for your\npilot users can literally just take hours.\n\n351\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.640\nIf we were to try to do this on\na deployment like we would normally do\n\n352\n00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.340\na standard deployment this might\nhave taken days if not weeks\n\n353\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.285\nbefore we were actually\nready to even accept a user\n\n354\n00:21:34.285 --> 00:21:36.632\nin after getting all\nthe infrastructure set up.\n\n355\n00:21:36.632 --> 00:21:41.790\nThis one a little more complicated as\nfar as just some of the details go, but\n\n356\n00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.190\nis not an entirely complicated process\n\n357\n00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.820\nif you've already set up your\noffice 365 demo account.\n\n358\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:53.100\nIf you already set up your domain it\nreally is going and modifying just a few\n\n359\n00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:58.560\nthings on your Exchange Server,\non your DNS registrar, and then inside of\n\n360\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.860\nthe Office 365 admin console, and\nit doesn't really take a super long time,\n\n361\n00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.990\nbut it does actually require you to kind\nof work through it a little bit more.\n\n362\n00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.430\nMake sure everything's working at the end,\n\n363\n00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.960\nand that's probably gonna be\nthe longest part is verifying that\n\n364\n00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.440\neverything is actually relaying\nthe email the way that you need to.\n\n365\n00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.090\n>> Excellent Ronnie.\n\n366\n00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.520\nWell, obviously it was a lot of fun to\nget the hood popped up on this puppy and\n\n367\n00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.020\nsee what's going on internally to make\nthese emails at least start to begin\n\n368\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.280\nthat process of let's send some emails,\nlet's get some users connected.\n\n369\n00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.890\nI look forward to seeing what\nelse you have in line for us

Creating a test plan will involve making sure that your environment is prepared for integration with Office365, so Daniel and Ronnie make sure to introduce you to the fastrack tool from Microsoft which helps you determine that fact. They also discuss systems that might not require migration and finally go over aspects of all the Office365 service descriptions.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.660\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode\n\n4\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.170\nwe are continuing on with our\nMicrosoft Office 365 identities and\n\n5\n00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.240\nrequirement series brought\nto you by ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.275\nThat's right, and joining me today is none\nother than my good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:32.450\nRonnie, thank you for joining us today.\n\n8\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.680\nHow are you doing today sir?\n\n9\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.003\n>> I am doing great today as we continue\non taking a look at this little topic.\n\n10\n00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:39.036\nI say little topic.\n\n11\n00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:42.304\nIt's actually been a multi\npart mini series for us here,\n\n12\n00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:46.065\nin managing identities and\nrequirements here in Office 365.\n\n13\n00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:49.305\nWe're talking about planning a pilot, and\n\n14\n00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:52.135\nin this particular episode we're going\nto take a look at some of the different\n\n15\n00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:56.855\nthings that we may want to actually\nconsider again, and you may wonder,\n\n16\n00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:59.000\nwell didn't we actually\ntalk about all that stuff?\n\n17\n00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.720\nYes, to a point we have, and we actually\neven showed you some of the steps that we\n\n18\n00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.060\ngo through when we start talking about\nplanning a pilot knowing that we actually\n\n19\n00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.910\nstart at the very beginning and\nall the stuff that we have to do.\n\n20\n00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.840\nBut a lot of times when we start taking\na look at the idea of saying hey,\n\n21\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.820\nwe're gonna move into Office 365,\nyou may not actually even be ready for\n\n22\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.120\nthat type of commitment to you even say\nI wanna sign up for a trial account.\n\n23\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.530\nIt may just be timing, right?\n\n24\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.170\nThe very fact is that somebody mentioned\nit let's say at the end of the previous\n\n25\n00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.690\nyear and here it is your other brand new\nyear saying you know, I think I wanna\n\n26\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.390\nlook into this, but I really don't wanna\ngo and set myself up with the 30 day\n\n27\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.580\naccount right now cuz I know I'm not gonna\nbe able to get to it right then and there.\n\n28\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.390\n>> So, it may be something else that\nyou want to actually take a look at,\n\n29\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.830\nwhich is the idea of creating what\nwe call a test case of some sort and\n\n30\n00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.190\ntrying to figure what you can do.\n\n31\n00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.170\nNow, the pilot is actually gonna be kinda\nthe end result of that idea of setting\n\n32\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.840\nup a test case, but what Microsoft has\nalso done for us of course is to try and\n\n33\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.110\nprovide for things that we actually\nknow that we can measure, and\n\n34\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.620\nalso provide along the line so\nthat when we do start to implement and\n\n35\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.140\nstart to roll out even the pilot\nthat we are ready to go.\n\n36\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.637\nSo when we take a look here at actually\nbeginning we've actually talked about some\n\n37\n00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:15.929\nof the steps before, and let me kinda\nreview some of the things we've already\n\n38\n00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:18.260\ntalked about in this series so far, right.\n\n39\n00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.770\nWe've talked about the idea of just making\nsure that we know how to setup a tenant\n\n40\n00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.810\naccount right.\n\n41\n00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.330\nThe very fact that we can\nstart off with a simple trial.\n\n42\n00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.380\nThe trial's absolutely free, and\n\n43\n00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.860\nthen from that point we go into making\nsure that it can work with our domain,\n\n44\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.630\nand so usually it's actually gonna be of\ncourse then making sure that we add our\n\n45\n00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.220\nown domain into it, setting up users\nalong with their email accounts,\n\n46\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.700\nmaking sure that those pilot users\nare able to get to what they need to, but\n\n47\n00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.520\nlet's just stop right there at that point,\nright.\n\n48\n00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.614\nThe very fact is we can get into that and\n\n49\n00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:54.675\nthen we can just let it kinda roll along\nand do the same thing and experience\n\n50\n00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:58.999\nall of the difficulties as it goes along\nas we're implementing the pilot, but\n\n51\n00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:03.256\nMicrosoft really says look if you really\nwant to get started, and you're not\n\n52\n00:03:03.256 --> 00:03:07.360\nexactly sure what has to be measured and\nhow you have to do certain things.\n\n53\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.020\nLet's go ahead and\nset up of course what we call a test case.\n\n54\n00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.460\nSomething that you can set up that\nthen can at least give you kind of\n\n55\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.800\nthe documentation as you roll along and\nstart doing this, and make sure that\n\n56\n00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.430\nyou're hitting those markers along the way\nas well, and so the way that they do that\n\n57\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.430\nis by providing a website after you\nactually create your initial tenancy.\n\n58\n00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.530\nYou can actually go ahead and run through\nthat set up inside of the Office 365\n\n59\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.270\nadmin console and from there if you just\nfollow those steps through, that will help\n\n60\n00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.050\nyou at least get to that point where you\nneed to, but what do you do after that?\n\n61\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.550\nHow do you actually continue to make this,\nand to make this a successful pilot\n\n62\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.670\nthat then you can present and\nyou can actually go and\n\n63\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.010\ntalk to your company about rolling\nforward with everything else here?\n\n64\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.230\nSo the way that we do that is by using\nthis website called FastTrack.Office.com.\n\n65\n00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.590\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n66\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.730\nAll right, so here it is.\n\n67\n00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.190\nI'm just on my machine and what I'm\ngonna do is click on a new tab, and\n\n68\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.965\nI'm gonna type in FastTrack, and\nI've been to it a couple of times here.\n\n69\n00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:13.410\n.Office.com, and when I do so\n\n70\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.400\nin a moment it's gonna bring us to well,\nthis website here.\n\n71\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.990\nOkay, now in this website for\nFastTrack for\n\n72\n00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.810\nOffice 365 notice it says it's\na customer success service\n\n73\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.410\ndesigned to help you move to Office 365\nsmoothly and with more confidence, right?\n\n74\n00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.260\nAnd not only that to be able to do it as\nquickly as you can if you really feel like\n\n75\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.280\nthat I don't know if I'm ready to\nreally get started right then, but\n\n76\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.900\nI know that I need to have some plan\nto make sure that I'm on track here.\n\n77\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.560\nWell, the only thing that you need to do,\nis simply go ahead and sign in.\n\n78\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.280\nNow this is where it gets\na little bit tricky, right?\n\n79\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.540\nI clicked on sign in, and it doesn't\nlead you to any place except for\n\n80\n00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.940\nanother sign in page, and\nthis is kind of a little bit weird.\n\n81\n00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.790\nMicrosoft normally when you click on\nsign in it says all right, go ahead and\n\n82\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.384\nsign in, but here they've changed some of\nthe policies during this past year, so\n\n83\n00:05:02.384 --> 00:05:08.120\nbefore you only needed,\nexcuse me, a Microsoft account.\n\n84\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.210\nSo if you have already been using\nHotmail.com or Outlook.com.\n\n85\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.210\nIf you've been using that for\nyour email you could sign in and\n\n86\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.740\nthen you're able to go, but what they\nreally want you to then is to go ahead and\n\n87\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.190\nnotice it says organizational ID.\n\n88\n00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.110\nYou must use a work or\n\n89\n00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.860\nschool account known as an organizational\nID to sign into Fasttrack.\n\n90\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.750\nPersonal ID's including Microsoft\naccounts are no longer accepted.\n\n91\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.540\nSo if your unsure go and\nask your network administrator.\n\n92\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.040\nNow, what does that actually mean for you?\n\n93\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.560\nThat's why you have to create that tenancy\nfirst if you're really going to do this.\n\n94\n00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.870\nSo once you actually go to Office 365 and\nyou sign up for that trial account,\n\n95\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.860\nyou've essentially now become\nan organizational ID that now I click sign\n\n96\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.480\nin, and when I do so it's gonna\nlead me to the actual sign in page.\n\n97\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.230\nAt least I think it's gonna lead\nme to the sign in page here.\n\n98\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.330\nIt looks like it's taking a little\nbit of time doing so, and\n\n99\n00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.070\nI simply enter in the credentials that I\nused with, or I don't have to enter it.\n\n100\n00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.950\nIt actually logged me in, so that's fine.\n\n101\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.620\nSometimes it actually brings you to\na login site where it fills in your\n\n102\n00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.870\ncredentials for you.\n\n103\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.320\nSometimes you actually just get right in.\n\n104\n00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.520\nSo, right here notice it's my\nITPro TV demo account, and\n\n105\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.100\nI can see that over here.\n\n106\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.490\nI of course can even upload in my\nown company logo if I wanted to to\n\n107\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.450\nmake it identifiable to me.\n\n108\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.780\nNow, you might be wondering why the heck\ndo I care about something like that?\n\n109\n00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.860\nWell, you can actually\nshare this side out.\n\n110\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.510\nSo, if I thought that I was doing this and\ngetting it all set up, but\n\n111\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.000\nI was going to bring Daniel on board as\na second project manager to let's say help\n\n112\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.680\ndo deployment let's say in another\nbranch office or another company.\n\n113\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.800\nWell, we can actually now share this site,\nand he can go in there and\n\n114\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.190\nactually start doing some of\nthe things that he wants to do as well.\n\n115\n00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.680\nSo it gives us a nice little intro\nabout how to use the FastTrack, and\n\n116\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.110\nof course you can actually invite\nothers into it and be able to see,\n\n117\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.250\nand notice it actually starts setting up\nthings that we'll call success plans, and\n\n118\n00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.380\nthat's what we're normally\ntaking a look at here.\n\n119\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.280\nBegin your customer's journey by\ncollaborating with them on the development\n\n120\n00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.770\nof a success plan that provides\na clear path for deployment and\n\n121\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.490\nadoption of that cloud service.\n\n122\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.250\nThe way to get started here is not\nactually beginning with these overviews\n\n123\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.705\nright here even though\nyou actually see that.\n\n124\n00:07:21.705 --> 00:07:25.470\nIt's to come up here to the very top,\nand what you're looking for\n\n125\n00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.870\nis underneath where it says\nsuccess plan it says dashboard.\n\n126\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.200\nSo if I click on that link for dashboard\n\n127\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.990\nnow you actually be getting to\nsee here on the ITPro TV demo.\n\n128\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.120\nAt this point we're seeing kind of the\nsame things, but notice now I have this\n\n129\n00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.380\nblue button right here on the right hand\nside that says to create a success plan.\n\n130\n00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.076\nSo if I go ahead and click on that\nsuccess plan now you'll notice it wants\n\n131\n00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:54.863\nme to go ahead and\nset up just some of the basic things.\n\n132\n00:07:54.863 --> 00:07:58.940\nNow, you may be wondering, how is this\ngoing to be important in the future and\n\n133\n00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.031\nwhy do I need to enter in all this stuff?\n\n134\n00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:04.259\nWhat it's also doing in the background,\nand we're not gonna go through the entire\n\n135\n00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:06.770\nprocess, but\nI did wanna show you a little bit of it.\n\n136\n00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.470\nDaniel, what this is actually\ndoing is as we fill in this stuff,\n\n137\n00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.190\nit's creating a PowerPoint for us.\n\n138\n00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.910\n>> Ooh, isn't that fancy?\n\n139\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.290\n>> I know, you might go,\nwho the heck cares?\n\n140\n00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.160\nWell, at the end of everything, right, as\nyou're actually going, hey, I wanna start\n\n141\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.870\nplanning this thing out and showing\npeople, and now we're ready to present it.\n\n142\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.010\nWell, what Daniel or\nI can do is go back through, and\n\n143\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.260\nthen in the end,\nwe actually download that PowerPoint, and\n\n144\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.160\nwe've got a nice PowerPoint presentation\nthat we can now go to those people that\n\n145\n00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.230\nwe need the buy in from and show them,\nhere's the plan of action we're gonna do.\n\n146\n00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.610\nHere's everything that we\nactually wanna set up here.\n\n147\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.950\nSo it's a really nice little thing\nthat they've added in some bells and\n\n148\n00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.480\nwhistles that, I hate to say it,\nthat would be my worst part.\n\n149\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.410\nIs I would go through all this stuff, and\nthen, in the end, somebody says, well,\n\n150\n00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.748\njust bring us a PowerPoint\npresentation and let's.\n\n151\n00:08:53.748 --> 00:08:58.820\nI'm like, oh no, and I hate to say it, I\nmight spend ten minutes on the PowerPoint.\n\n152\n00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.110\nAfter awhile it's just gonna be blank\nPowerPoint slides with just bullet points.\n\n153\n00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.480\nThat's all mine's gonna be, but\n\n154\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.320\nthis will actually kind of bring\nyou a nice little presentation.\n\n155\n00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.970\nSo they've really thought about everything\nto make this as successful as possible for\n\n156\n00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.950\nthose of you that are actually\nworking on this thing,\n\n157\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.770\nand I'm just going to\nenter in a few things.\n\n158\n00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:20.380\nSo if I sit there and say plan name,\nand we'll just call this one initial,\n\n159\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:26.978\nwell let's just do IT pro, I can't spell,\n\n160\n00:09:26.978 --> 00:09:33.092\nITproTVdemo here,\n\n161\n00:09:33.092 --> 00:09:36.410\nand then it of course\nwants to enter in a scope.\n\n162\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.350\nNow what they're actually saying is,\nthey want this to\n\n163\n00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.670\nkind of like an introductory slide for\nyou like, why do we care?\n\n164\n00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.400\nWhat do we want here?\n\n165\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.560\nWhat's the scope of it?\n\n166\n00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.277\nAnd we're just gonna say,\n\n167\n00:09:49.277 --> 00:09:53.586\ndeploying Office 365\n\n168\n00:09:53.586 --> 00:09:58.310\nthroughout ITProTV Demo.\n\n169\n00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.650\nSo we can do that and it gives you up\nto 1,000 characters if you choose to.\n\n170\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.230\nAnd of course, now notice it says,\n\n171\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:10.350\nto distinguish your plan in the timeline\nview, what color do you want,\n\n172\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.230\nand you have all these different\ncolors that you can choose from.\n\n173\n00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.660\nI'll choose blue just for sake here.\n\n174\n00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.240\nYou don't have to.\n\n175\n00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.274\nYou can leave it at the default, and\n\n176\n00:10:21.274 --> 00:10:25.992\nnow it says, is this a test success plan?\n\n177\n00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:29.674\nIn other words, if you want this to\nactually just be that test run, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:29.674 --> 00:10:32.710\nAnd so I can go and\njust plan it as that and say yes, and\n\n179\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.583\nthen we simply follow through.\n\n180\n00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:37.627\nAnd now notice,\nit starts to give us the information, and\n\n181\n00:10:37.627 --> 00:10:41.542\nthis is where we do have to sit down\na little bit of time here, actually say,\n\n182\n00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:44.340\nhow fast do I really\nwant this thing to go?\n\n183\n00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.530\nAnd from that point, you go ahead and say,\nwhen you're gonna kick this plan off.\n\n184\n00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.600\nAnd so, let's say, we would do this\nbeginning on, oh look, February 1st is\n\n185\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.290\na Monday, that will actually work, and\nthen, when do we hope to complete it by?\n\n186\n00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:01.160\nLet's see if, say March 1st,\nlet's do something like that.\n\n187\n00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.030\nOkay, so\nwhat type of success plan is this?\n\n188\n00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.970\nAm I using this just to help people to\nadopt and to be able to use Office 365,\n\n189\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.178\nor is this about deployment and\nimplementation?\n\n190\n00:11:12.178 --> 00:11:16.193\nNotice if I choose deployment and\nimplementation, it automatically chooses\n\n191\n00:11:16.193 --> 00:11:20.163\nthe other one for us too, because it\nbelieves it's all a part of everything.\n\n192\n00:11:20.163 --> 00:11:23.303\nBut I can just do the adoption and\nusage if we've already rolled it out and\n\n193\n00:11:23.303 --> 00:11:26.480\nwe're trying to convince\npeople to come along, too.\n\n194\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.660\nNow, of course, then from that point,\nthere are now establishing work loads and\n\n195\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.110\nwork flows for us in what has to be\ndone for us to be successful, and so\n\n196\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.630\nthis is where we can go through and\ncreate that and try and figure out.\n\n197\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.042\nWhat it is that I need to\nactually include in it?\n\n198\n00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:48.236\nSo I want Office 365, but let's say\nI don't want something like Yammer,\n\n199\n00:11:48.236 --> 00:11:54.166\nokay, which is like an internal Facebook\ntype of service is what we have.\n\n200\n00:11:54.166 --> 00:11:56.125\nAnd I may not be doing project management,\n\n201\n00:11:56.125 --> 00:11:59.392\nso I don't have to actually include\neverything in there, I can pick and\n\n202\n00:11:59.392 --> 00:12:02.566\nchoose, and then you can come along and\nsee some of the other things.\n\n203\n00:12:02.566 --> 00:12:05.932\nAre you going to be using\nBYOD in your network?\n\n204\n00:12:05.932 --> 00:12:09.260\nAll right, so notice Enterprise Mobility\n\n205\n00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.880\noptions that you might actually add in\nhere for being able to manage those\n\n206\n00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.360\ndevices that actually are outside\nof the scope of our regular domain.\n\n207\n00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.400\nAnd if we're actually doing that,\nwe may want to include that, and\n\n208\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.180\nwe're going to be using the dynamics that\ncustomer relationship management system,\n\n209\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.300\nor even Microsoft Azure.\n\n210\n00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.170\nSo if I know what I'm gonna be using,\nnotice that I'm establishing, essentially,\n\n211\n00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.420\nthat scope and everything else, as well\nas work loads and dates and stuff, and\n\n212\n00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.790\nmay find out that I can't build\neverything that I want to,\n\n213\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.130\nbut it's actually gonna do that.\n\n214\n00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.200\nGo ahead and click next, and\n\n215\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.500\nnow, who else am I inviting in,\nother team members, you name it.\n\n216\n00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.060\nYou can continue to add those in there and\nthat will build your team and\n\n217\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.329\nwho's actually gonna do that,\nand then click next.\n\n218\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.610\nAnd now you can see there's a summary of\nall the stuff that we've actually saved or\n\n219\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.280\njust kind of finished here, and\nthen we click Save & Finish, and\n\n220\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.350\nhopefully right here in the moment,\na little blue bar going across the screen\n\n221\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.350\nis now going to give us\nthis test plan idea.\n\n222\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.625\nAnd now notice, there it is Daniel,\nthis little link here that says\n\n223\n00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:16.303\nthe PowerPoint summary or\nI can even have a word document.\n\n224\n00:13:16.303 --> 00:13:17.963\n>> Do they open it in Office 365?\n\n225\n00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:20.579\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think you can open it in Office 365,\n\n226\n00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:22.913\nbut you kind of see where, at this point,\n\n227\n00:13:22.913 --> 00:13:26.718\nthis is where you as someone that's\nleading this idea of the pilot,\n\n228\n00:13:26.718 --> 00:13:31.790\nyou simply go in and you select which\nenvironment that you're going to start on.\n\n229\n00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.420\nSo it says overview,\nif I want to I click on start.\n\n230\n00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.779\nAnd actually that was probably\njust a silly one there for\n\n231\n00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:43.655\nus, for me to click on, but now you simply\nstart asking these questions, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:49.065\nSo in every single one of them will\nactually tell you what needs to be done,\n\n233\n00:13:49.065 --> 00:13:51.523\nand identify the stakeholders.\n\n234\n00:13:51.523 --> 00:13:55.228\nSo yes you see where there were a little\nwhat it looked like Is this gonna actually\n\n235\n00:13:55.228 --> 00:13:58.992\nuse something like Microsoft Project in\nthe background to help you to guide those\n\n236\n00:13:58.992 --> 00:14:00.400\nsteps along.\n\n237\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.340\nSo if you don't think that Microsoft is\ntrying to make it as easy as you can for\n\n238\n00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.760\nthe success that you\nwant to actually have.\n\n239\n00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.260\nYeah, it's incredible.\n\n240\n00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.620\nIt is so incredible that they've said,\nlook, we're not only gonna\n\n241\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.750\nshow you this product that's really\na great product, but we're gonna help you\n\n242\n00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:21.810\nat every step of the way to make sure\nsuccess and I even fast tracking that way.\n\n243\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.250\nSo a lot of good ways that you can\nactually build your test case and\n\n244\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.460\ncustomize it specifically for your needs\neven during your initial roll out or\n\n245\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.000\nyour pilot thinking as you actually begin.\n\n246\n00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.008\n>> Yeah, it sounds like Microsoft is\nreally doing everything they can to remove\n\n247\n00:14:37.008 --> 00:14:40.152\nevery road block or\ncaveat that you might come up with to say,\n\n248\n00:14:40.152 --> 00:14:42.141\nthis might not be the solution for us.\n\n249\n00:14:42.141 --> 00:14:44.300\nThey're trying to make\nit as easy as possible.\n\n250\n00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.109\nAnd to be honest with you,\n\n251\n00:14:46.109 --> 00:14:50.225\nit's really a two fold blessing\nbecause it makes it easy for\n\n252\n00:14:50.225 --> 00:14:55.495\nus to get through this thing and actually\nstart working with the software and\n\n253\n00:14:55.495 --> 00:14:59.883\nreally deciding whether or\nnot this is something for us or not.\n\n254\n00:14:59.883 --> 00:15:03.571\nAnd if it is that easy, we're gonna\ncontinue to tout its goodness and\n\n255\n00:15:03.571 --> 00:15:07.449\ntell everybody isn't this nice,\nwe didn't have to roll out software,\n\n256\n00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:10.040\nwe didn't have to do anything like this.\n\n257\n00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.457\nI had fast track to help\nme out through this.\n\n258\n00:15:12.457 --> 00:15:16.171\nNow Ronnie, once we get the, talking\nabout FastTrack, once we're done with\n\n259\n00:15:16.171 --> 00:15:20.283\nthe FastTrack, it's got all PowerPoint,\ngiven us all the question and everything,\n\n260\n00:15:20.283 --> 00:15:22.500\nare we then ready to\nimplement our test pilot?\n\n261\n00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.240\n>> A lot of times because you are probably\ntrying to get those initial steps done,\n\n262\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.220\nis now that you have a guidance, right,\n\n263\n00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.300\nyou now have guidance documents and\neven this work site.\n\n264\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.206\nThat you might go, look, this is\nbeyond me, so, let's say for example,\n\n265\n00:15:36.206 --> 00:15:40.187\nI don't have any experience doing\nactive record, but Daniel really does.\n\n266\n00:15:40.187 --> 00:15:43.526\nI can go to that section now start\ndoing it as a project manager,\n\n267\n00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:46.550\nsaying, Daniel can you take\na look at this, and tell me,\n\n268\n00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.405\nare these things that you\ncan actually handle and do?\n\n269\n00:15:49.405 --> 00:15:51.332\nAnd that way he just\nchecks on the site and\n\n270\n00:15:51.332 --> 00:15:54.963\nhe can start answering those questions,\nand it gives him the deployment and\n\n271\n00:15:54.963 --> 00:15:57.700\neverything that he needs to\nget started and to get going.\n\n272\n00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.237\nIt really is kind of a very neat\nthing because at the end, right,\n\n273\n00:16:01.237 --> 00:16:04.460\neven though we're kind of\nrolling everything together.\n\n274\n00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.143\nOnce he goes, yeah, that's pretty good.\n\n275\n00:16:06.143 --> 00:16:09.615\nWe either go ahead at that point,\nnow that we have our tenant account, and\n\n276\n00:16:09.615 --> 00:16:13.095\nwe can start rolling in all those users\nthat we want to actually be in that.\n\n277\n00:16:13.095 --> 00:16:17.317\nOr we actually just use this as a\nguideline for the ultimate deployment and\n\n278\n00:16:17.317 --> 00:16:19.610\nnot just for the pilot itself.\n\n279\n00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.680\nSo it really is kind of\na very nice feature,\n\n280\n00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.540\nthat you're building everything\nas you're going along.\n\n281\n00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.030\nAnd that's what they really want.\n\n282\n00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.900\nRemember that three step process that\nMicrosoft is really probably gonna\n\n283\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.980\ngrill you on, right?\n\n284\n00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.700\nThe very fact is pilot, deployment and\nthen enhancement at the end,\n\n285\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:39.580\ntrying to figure out exactly what you\nneed to do now also along with it.\n\n286\n00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.680\nSo we're kinda not gonna go\nthrough every single step there.\n\n287\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.850\nThat's stuff that you can take\na look at and explore on your own.\n\n288\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.170\nBut just kind of realize that\nthose tools are available for you.\n\n289\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.870\nIf you happen to be one of those people\nthat have to have all your i's dotted and\n\n290\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.490\nall your t's crossed, this is probably\nthe one for you to go through.\n\n291\n00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.020\nBut there's other things that\nwe have to worry about as well.\n\n292\n00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.260\nWe know that within an organization,\nespecially as we're starting to move\n\n293\n00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.920\ntowards cloud services, we're gonna find\nout that sometimes there's gonna be stuff\n\n294\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.990\nthat we need to not actually be able to\nmigrate toward those cloud services and\n\n295\n00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:18.090\nwe need to consider that as part of\nwhat we call our planning as well.\n\n296\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:22.420\nSo what we want to be able to do here,\nis to make sure that we identify\n\n297\n00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.570\nthe particular types of workloads that\nwe're never gonna turn over Office 365.\n\n298\n00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:30.770\nIt's always kind of an unusual,\n\n299\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:36.680\nI'm trying to think of the right word,\nan unusual balance for the company.\n\n300\n00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.270\nThat it's like, man,\n\n301\n00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:43.040\nthe majority of our productivity software,\nis now gonna be handled in the cloud.\n\n302\n00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.060\nOur email system is going to the cloud.\n\n303\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.910\nMoving away from online\nstorage services for\n\n304\n00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:54.220\nall of my users to go into,\nyou SharePoint sides and\n\n305\n00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.040\nOneDrive for business, and that's what\nthe SharePoint side is called now.\n\n306\n00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.940\nIt's called OneDrive for Business.\n\n307\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.320\nAnd all my storage is going up there but\n\n308\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.420\nare there still things I now\nneed to house on premise?\n\n309\n00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.930\nAre there still things that I\nneed to worry about internally?\n\n310\n00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.800\nYou do, and you need to be able to know\nhow that separation needs to happen and\n\n311\n00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.490\nis gonna come about as well.\n\n312\n00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.280\nSo, a lot of times when we start talking\nabout some of the things that we're\n\n313\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.420\nprobably never going to,\nI don't wanna say never.\n\n314\n00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.300\nBut at least at this point,\nlet's put it that way.\n\n315\n00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.280\nAt this point in our migration,\n\n316\n00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.510\nwe wanna consider probably that it's not\ngonna ever become part of the migration.\n\n317\n00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.660\nAre things like custom\nbusiness applications,\n\n318\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.090\nwe normally call them line\nof business applications.\n\n319\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.590\nWhat was the one that you used at\nthe insurance office that you didn't like?\n\n320\n00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.170\n>> Yeah it was called Image Write.\n\n321\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:49.850\nIt was basically a digitizing of paper for\ninsurance companies.\n\n322\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.960\nThey take all of that paperwork that you\nfill out when you make an insurance claim\n\n323\n00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.380\nand they said hey, let's stop doing\npaper folders, let's digitize it,\n\n324\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.595\nit was a very complex system and\na bit of a nightmare.\n\n325\n00:19:00.595 --> 00:19:02.180\n[LAUGH]\n>> And so sometimes you hate to say this,\n\n326\n00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.780\nyou kind of realize that Office 365,\n\n327\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.210\nthere's nothing you're gonna\nbe able to do with it.\n\n328\n00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.750\nSo you know that those are things that\n\n329\n00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.080\nyou're gonna have to\nkeep on track as well.\n\n330\n00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.910\nYou also may have particular types of\nsystems that never is gonna integrate in.\n\n331\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.800\nSo the most common example are things\nlike point of sale systems\n\n332\n00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.490\nthat you might have there.\n\n333\n00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.898\nThat these are things that you\njust have to manage on your own.\n\n334\n00:19:24.898 --> 00:19:28.500\nSo even though you might be able to do the\nmajority of some of the productivity stuff\n\n335\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.970\nthat you do with Office 365,\nyou wanna keep that in mind.\n\n336\n00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.590\nAnd the last one that I\nwanted to also point out\n\n337\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.060\nwas things like\nInventory Management Systems too.\n\n338\n00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.490\nSo, somebody may say, oh no,\nI think I can use Access online\n\n339\n00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:49.270\nwith Office 365, and I can actually do\nasset tracking and do all that stuff.\n\n340\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.660\nWell, that might be true but remember,\nif your system has developed over a long\n\n341\n00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:58.550\nperiod of time, the migration from\nan old system to something that's\n\n342\n00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:03.080\ngeneric as Access, don't get me wrong,\nAccess is a wonderful piece of software,\n\n343\n00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.150\nbut it's probably not custom designed for\nyour business.\n\n344\n00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.090\nSo anything that was probably built for\nyour business, or probably for\n\n345\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.620\nyou particular sector\nthat you're working in,\n\n346\n00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.822\nis probably not going to\nbe Office 365 migration.\n\n347\n00:20:14.822 --> 00:20:17.630\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, unfortunately, Microsoft\n\n348\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.280\nis not out there, well they may be but,\n[LAUGHS] and they have done it over\n\n349\n00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.860\nthe past, they see a good product and they\nemulate it or they buy it and absorb it.\n\n350\n00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.480\nBut for right now, they can never touch\neverything that's gonna be out there.\n\n351\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.250\nSo you're always going\nto have those one offs,\n\n352\n00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:35.130\nthat's never going to be taken over by\nsomething that Microsoft will offer you.\n\n353\n00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.500\nThat being said,\ntalk about what Microsoft does offer.\n\n354\n00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.760\nWhen we take a look in Office 365.\n\n355\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.990\nIt's really kind of funny, Ronny.\n\n356\n00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.300\nThey offer very few things.\n\n357\n00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.040\nBut they offer very many\nways to do those few things.\n\n358\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.080\nYou're going to help clarify\nwhat I mean by that right?\n\n359\n00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.930\n>> Right.\nYeah so,\n\n360\n00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.620\nwhen you take a look at it,\nit's kind of a weird conundrum.\n\n361\n00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.780\nI remember the first time I\nheard about Office 365, and\n\n362\n00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.660\nI was like what's the big deal?\n\n363\n00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.780\nYou're taking the Office Productivity\nSuite and you're putting it online.\n\n364\n00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.150\nIt's no longer gonna\nreally be on my computer.\n\n365\n00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.330\nSo why is everybody all\nexcited about this thing?\n\n366\n00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.910\nIt doesn't really seem to bring\nthat much excitement when I\n\n367\n00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.430\nthought about it in that way.\n\n368\n00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.360\nBut the very fact is, now that we\ncan actually take that software and\n\n369\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.300\nnot only do that, but have a lot\nof the services that normally are,\n\n370\n00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:27.770\nI can't remember what we called it in\nanother episode, the heart breaking,\n\n371\n00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:32.700\nthe kind of intensive stuff that we have\nto do in just maintaining certain systems.\n\n372\n00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.580\nWell now, we can say,\nlook let's just pay Microsoft to do it.\n\n373\n00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.580\nLet's go ahead and just pay Office 365 to\nhandle things like our Exchange Server and\n\n374\n00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:45.630\nto handle our file shares that now, when\nwe talk about redundancy with the SAN,\n\n375\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.425\nokay, so we're gonna back\nup over towards Inverness.\n\n376\n00:21:49.425 --> 00:21:50.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Our huge,\n\n377\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.810\ngigantic backup site over in Inverness.\n\n378\n00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:57.090\nWhatever it might be, and now we have\nto build another site over there.\n\n379\n00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:01.180\nWell Microsoft can have\ntheir One Drive for\n\n380\n00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.210\nBusiness, where the servers are replicated\nthroughout the entire world.\n\n381\n00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.665\n>> By the way,\nInverness is a small city in Florida.\n\n382\n00:22:06.665 --> 00:22:08.860\n[LAUGH] A very small city.\n\n383\n00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.020\n>> No, yeah, I was just trying to\nmake a little joke that I knew that\n\n384\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.490\nDaniel would understand like, yeah,\nthat's where we're gonna back up to, and\n\n385\n00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:15.640\nI think it's prone to flooding too.\n\n386\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.950\n>> Yeah.\n>> I thought so, so\n\n387\n00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.430\nyou might actually see that.\n\n388\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.320\nBut what Office 365 does, and\nthe other things that it does,\n\n389\n00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.860\nis they really wanna make it as what\nwe call a la carte as possible.\n\n390\n00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.530\nThey want gigantic businesses to use them.\n\n391\n00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.350\nThey want governments to use them.\n\n392\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.630\nBut they also want the individual user,\nthe college student, that says look,\n\n393\n00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:41.890\nI can't afford hundred and\nthirty bucks a month or\n\n394\n00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:46.620\nwhat ever it is, or $200 for\nthe entire Office suite.\n\n395\n00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.230\nI just need about to be able to use it for\nthe time I'm in college, and\n\n396\n00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.852\nthen I'm done with it.\n\n397\n00:22:49.852 --> 00:22:54.260\nI don't worry about it as well, but\nremember that those two scenarios at\n\n398\n00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.600\nthe extreme ends that they are,\none guy really doesn't require much.\n\n399\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.390\nHe requires the email address,\nhe requires access to Office.\n\n400\n00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:06.760\nYour business, though, might require\nthe storage sites that we talked about,\n\n401\n00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.710\nthe idea of collaboration between\nthe software, the idea of actually\n\n402\n00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:15.340\ndoing something like actual live time,\nlike with Skype for business, you name it,\n\n403\n00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.932\nthere are so many other services, email-\n>> We're a prime example of that,\n\n404\n00:23:18.932 --> 00:23:23.190\nactually Ronny, cuz we were using\na different provider, I won't name who.\n\n405\n00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.440\nThey shall remain nameless.\n\n406\n00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.203\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n407\n00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:26.951\n>> But we are now on Office 365 and\n\n408\n00:23:26.951 --> 00:23:30.513\nthat took care of our email and\nalso took care of our office solutions,\n\n409\n00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:33.630\nthings like Word and Excel,\nthings we needed like that.\n\n410\n00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.030\nBut then we also had\nanother phone provider.\n\n411\n00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.900\nAnd guess what?\nSkype for business was a better solution.\n\n412\n00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.710\nSo we jumped over to that.\n\n413\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.290\nSo we added that to our carts,\nand now we use that as well.\n\n414\n00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.430\nSo, a lot of very\ninteresting platforms and\n\n415\n00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:51.490\nsoftware that they provide that you might\nnot think of when you think Office.\n\n416\n00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:53.430\n>> And not only that.\n\n417\n00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.520\nBut when you think about this, you're\nlike, well crud Ronny, I don't need that.\n\n418\n00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.566\nWell the good thing,\nlike I said, it's a la carte.\n\n419\n00:23:58.566 --> 00:24:02.540\nIn other words, you can buy kinda\nwhatever basic plan that you want, and\n\n420\n00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.842\nthen when you want more, such as that\nSkype for business You might find out that\n\n421\n00:24:06.842 --> 00:24:10.833\nyou can simply add that component in\nper user, and it's gonna cost you.\n\n422\n00:24:10.833 --> 00:24:13.120\nSo how the heck do you get\naccess to stuff like that?\n\n423\n00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.684\nWell, let's show you how to do that, and\n\n424\n00:24:14.684 --> 00:24:16.804\nthen we'll point out some of\nthe different things too.\n\n425\n00:24:16.804 --> 00:24:20.883\nNow remember, because it is a la carte,\nthat means that there's a lot of different\n\n426\n00:24:20.883 --> 00:24:24.494\nthings that we can add in to enhance and\nto make sure that we provide the very\n\n427\n00:24:24.494 --> 00:24:28.458\nright needs for our business that we need\nto, without having to add in additional\n\n428\n00:24:28.458 --> 00:24:32.304\ninfrastructure, even without having to\nadd in an additional person to be able\n\n429\n00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:36.190\nto manage that infrastructure,\nand that's pretty much the key.\n\n430\n00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:40.596\nSo here it is, I'm on my Office 365,\nand I'm gonna go to the admin console.\n\n431\n00:24:40.596 --> 00:24:44.054\nAnd once in the admin console,\non the left-hand navigation pane,\n\n432\n00:24:44.054 --> 00:24:48.178\nwe're gonna scroll down to, well,\nI know that it's hard to believe, Daniel,\n\n433\n00:24:48.178 --> 00:24:50.260\nit's where it says Purchase Services.\n\n434\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.180\nI mean, who would have thought that that\nwould be Microsoft's way to tell us that\n\n435\n00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.560\nthere's more available services to us?\n\n436\n00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.490\nAll right, so here are the actual\nservices that we have access to.\n\n437\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:01.828\nNow, when we take a look at it,\n\n438\n00:25:01.828 --> 00:25:05.121\nof course it has the big plans that we\nnormally would actually end up seeing,\n\n439\n00:25:05.121 --> 00:25:07.971\nand you can see I'm actually using\nthis trial version right now.\n\n440\n00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:10.821\nI have about 27 days left, and\nevery time I hover over it,\n\n441\n00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:12.717\nyou see where it says buy now, buy now.\n\n442\n00:25:12.717 --> 00:25:14.880\n[LAUGH]\n>> They're so up front about it.\n\n443\n00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.050\n>> Yeah, I think they're trying to tell\nme that I need to purchase something.\n\n444\n00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.970\nAnd so you do have all the different\nmajor plans right there, and\n\n445\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.410\nit tells you per user per month, but\nthen as we scroll on through, there's,\n\n446\n00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.270\nof course,\nother plans that we can get into.\n\n447\n00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:30.740\nSo, if you are actually using that\nCustomer Relational Management System,\n\n448\n00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.850\nnotice that this actually does get\na little bit higher in terms of\n\n449\n00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.754\nhow much money you can actually spend as\nyou actually go on through choosing that.\n\n450\n00:25:38.754 --> 00:25:41.430\nBut we wanna do is, we wanna actually\nsee some of these other plans, and\n\n451\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.960\nthis is where we start to\nget into the email system.\n\n452\n00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.950\nThe Exchange Online, if I'm going\nto go ahead and select that, and\n\n453\n00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.900\nnotice you actually add that in\non top of the plan that you had.\n\n454\n00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.578\nSo we had the E3 plan,\nwhich is the one that I had here,\n\n455\n00:25:56.578 --> 00:26:00.040\nand if I take a look, I think that\none is like $20 a month or so.\n\n456\n00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.760\nAnd then I scroll down\nhere toward the bottom.\n\n457\n00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.655\nHopefully, I'm not making anybody sick,\nas fast as I'm going here.\n\n458\n00:26:05.655 --> 00:26:08.830\n$4 a month, well, there's 24, and\n\n459\n00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:14.190\nthen if you want to archive your\nExchange server, an additional 3.\n\n460\n00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.450\nAnd so this is where you start seeing,\n\n461\n00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.230\nhere's an additional\n$1 per user per month.\n\n462\n00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.610\nExchange Online plan 2, SharePoint,\nyou name it, as you're going through,\n\n463\n00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:26.810\nthese are what they call the Office\nservices descriptions that you have\n\n464\n00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:31.586\naccess to, essentially a la carte,\nbuy what you need to, to make the Office\n\n465\n00:26:31.586 --> 00:26:37.010\n365 plan the way that you really\nwant it to fit into your business.\n\n466\n00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.746\nSo the price point, though,\n\n467\n00:26:38.746 --> 00:26:42.715\nis kind of the one that's a little\nbit of a killer here in this sense.\n\n468\n00:26:42.715 --> 00:26:46.339\nIt seems cheap, you go, okay,\nfive bucks a month for SharePoint,\n\n469\n00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:49.982\nthat sounds good, until you remember,\nit says per user per month.\n\n470\n00:26:49.982 --> 00:26:54.270\nSo all of a sudden, in our initial pilot\nwhere we mentioned it the other day that\n\n471\n00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:59.850\nwe'd probably have about 25 users,\nwell, now 25 times 5 per month,\n\n472\n00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.050\nit starts to add up very quickly,\njust for something like that.\n\n473\n00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.620\nAnd then you add in the 20\nbucks a month for that E3 plan.\n\n474\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.930\nWell, don't get me wrong,\n\n475\n00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.800\nit's probably absolutely worth it,\nas you need all those services.\n\n476\n00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.580\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhy is it so expensive?\n\n477\n00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.710\nWell, remember that if you don't, you're\nprobably going to buy another server\n\n478\n00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.140\nthat's going to cost you\nright out of pocket,\n\n479\n00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.320\nyou're going to get SharePoint set up,\nthat's going to be hours and hours, if not\n\n480\n00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.060\neven days, on end to get that up and\nrunning, and then all the setup behind it.\n\n481\n00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.714\nSharePoint Online, it is,\nit's just a configuration, they're hosting\n\n482\n00:27:30.714 --> 00:27:34.139\nthe servers, they're paying for\nthe software in the background, and\n\n483\n00:27:34.139 --> 00:27:38.096\nyou'll actually get the latest updates,\nyou name it, everything will be here.\n\n484\n00:27:38.096 --> 00:27:41.060\nAnd it even goes down\nhere as a Project Online,\n\n485\n00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.110\nProject Online with Project Pro,\nyou name it.\n\n486\n00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:48.110\nAzure Rights Management, there are so many\nother services that you can continue to\n\n487\n00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:51.460\npurchase here, and\nit's all about that, that a la carte.\n\n488\n00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.346\nBuy what you want to,\ndon't buy if you don't need to.\n\n489\n00:27:54.346 --> 00:27:57.189\nBut it gives you that right here through\nthis portal, you don't have to go and\n\n490\n00:27:57.189 --> 00:27:58.320\ntalk to anybody.\n\n491\n00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.140\nYou simply hover over it, and\nthen you buy it now, and you are ready and\n\n492\n00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.160\noff and going.\n\n493\n00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.930\nAnd so, understanding that there are\nadditional services besides the basic plan\n\n494\n00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:12.491\nof just getting Office onto your computer\nand establishing that connection is\n\n495\n00:28:12.491 --> 00:28:16.358\nwhat they also give you that ability\nto do, if your organization,\n\n496\n00:28:16.358 --> 00:28:20.471\nof course, needs more of that stuff,\nand that is pretty much the key.\n\n497\n00:28:20.471 --> 00:28:24.095\nOkay, so, plenty of services for\nus, lots to actually do there, so\n\n498\n00:28:24.095 --> 00:28:28.403\nif you don't think that Office has it,\ncheck out those purchases that you can do,\n\n499\n00:28:28.403 --> 00:28:32.524\nand just scroll through and see some of\nthose descriptions that are there, and\n\n500\n00:28:32.524 --> 00:28:36.320\nthat way you can actually choose\nwhat you need for your organization.\n\n501\n00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.110\nPretty good.\n>> Yes.\n\n502\n00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.785\nVery, very nice stuff, so\nlike Ronnie said, go through that.\n\n503\n00:28:39.785 --> 00:28:43.249\nThey've got a list of very excellent\nservices that they provide, but\n\n504\n00:28:43.249 --> 00:28:47.136\nbe aware that it is, usually, per user\nper month, so it's gonna aggregate.\n\n505\n00:28:47.136 --> 00:28:50.629\nSo keep a running tally of how much\nper month you're gonna be spending so\n\n506\n00:28:50.629 --> 00:28:54.669\nthat you don't get caught unaware, going,\noh, wow, why is this so expensive?\n\n507\n00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:57.050\nIt's because you added 20 users.\n\n508\n00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:01.170\nNow, speaking of users, Ronnie, obviously\nwe're going to have users that wanna\n\n509\n00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.900\ntake advantage of these\nservices from Office 365.\n\n510\n00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.640\nNow it's time to do what we call\nonboarding the users, right?\n\n511\n00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.460\n>> It is.\n\n512\n00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.670\nWhen we start taking a look\nat the idea of onboarding,\n\n513\n00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:16.230\nwe're now moving towards that idea\nthat maybe our, I can't say it right,\n\n514\n00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:21.370\nthe pilot plan is at this point where\nwe know that it's going to roll out.\n\n515\n00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:25.190\nWe believe that we've gone through\nkinda the majority of what we needed to\n\n516\n00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.610\nto test it out, and we're now\nstarting to get ready to roll and\n\n517\n00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.100\ndo everything that we need to.\n\n518\n00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.512\nWell, how do we begin the onboarding\nprocess for everyone, then?\n\n519\n00:29:33.512 --> 00:29:36.971\nWell, the good thing is, if you've already\ndone that for the pilot people that have\n\n520\n00:29:36.971 --> 00:29:39.470\nactually come on board,\nit's just about the same process.\n\n521\n00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:45.726\nBut what if you do have hundreds of users,\nand more than that, a lot of times.\n\n522\n00:29:45.726 --> 00:29:51.065\nWell, Microsoft, as you go on to those\nhigher premium plans like the E5 plan,\n\n523\n00:29:51.065 --> 00:29:55.848\nyou have more than 150 users,\nthey have special people there to help\n\n524\n00:29:55.848 --> 00:30:00.012\nyou to actually do the onboarding\nprocess if you need them to.\n\n525\n00:30:00.012 --> 00:30:04.059\nNow, the other thing that you can do, if\nyou have, let's say, 150 or less, though,\n\n526\n00:30:04.059 --> 00:30:06.680\nthey also give us a tool that\nwe can also use as well.\n\n527\n00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.904\nSo, let's go back and\ntake a look at my computer again, and\n\n528\n00:30:10.904 --> 00:30:15.046\nwe're coming back to this\nfasttrack.office.com, and\n\n529\n00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:20.388\nlet me verify as I sign in here, and\nmake sure that I actually get signed in.\n\n530\n00:30:20.388 --> 00:30:24.370\nAnd everything is actually coming\nin nice and fairly fast here.\n\n531\n00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.850\nSo here is the original plan that we had,\nas we went through,\n\n532\n00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.060\nwe could actually set up\nall that we needed to.\n\n533\n00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:35.660\nBut remember that back out here at the\noriginal Office here, we were just doing\n\n534\n00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.400\nthe idea of the plan for\nthe success here on the pilot planning.\n\n535\n00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.137\nBut if I click on Onboard,\nthey have the same process here, too.\n\n536\n00:30:44.137 --> 00:30:48.018\nSo notice that it actually gives us,\nit's between 1 and 149 people,\n\n537\n00:30:48.018 --> 00:30:51.397\nthey say, look, here's the steps\nthat you actually need, and\n\n538\n00:30:51.397 --> 00:30:55.240\nnotice that it says, I can log in and\nlaunch the wizard right now.\n\n539\n00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.900\nSo you're not sure and\nyou actually already have it set up and\n\n540\n00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.860\nyou've got your tenant ready to go,\nit says,\n\n541\n00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.450\nlet me guide you through it by logging\nin and setting it up for you right now.\n\n542\n00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:07.013\nYou can't beat that,\nthat's pretty darn hefty.\n\n543\n00:31:07.013 --> 00:31:12.533\nMore than 150 people, says for\nOffice 365 customers with at least 150,\n\n544\n00:31:12.533 --> 00:31:16.810\nMicrosoft provides direct\nremote assistance.\n\n545\n00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:20.230\nSo now notice that they actually\neven have a little chat or\n\n546\n00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.060\neven response time if you\nneed them to call back.\n\n547\n00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:27.500\nAnd so they have this ability for you to\ngo ahead and begin that migration process\n\n548\n00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.740\nas well, so that you can actually\nsee the other part of it.\n\n549\n00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:36.810\nAnd it's just about them trying to say,\nlook, you've got more than 150 people,\n\n550\n00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.200\nthey're probably at\nleast 20 bucks a month,\n\n551\n00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.110\nyou add that up, it's gonna come out to\nbe a pretty good hunk of change for them.\n\n552\n00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:47.940\nAnd so they also are offering you direct\nremote assistance to be able to help out.\n\n553\n00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.450\nNow you do have to worry\nabout the call time.\n\n554\n00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.260\nIn other words, how long am I taking?\n\n555\n00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.750\nBut overall, though, they actually\nwant you to be able to onboard\n\n556\n00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.620\nas quickly as you can, they want to\nprovide you with the best solution.\n\n557\n00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.304\nFor them, it's the remote assistance.\n\n558\n00:32:00.304 --> 00:32:02.580\nSo you name it,\ntwo different ways that you can do this.\n\n559\n00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:07.810\nBetween 1 and 149, they give you that\nprocess where you walk through a wizard,\n\n560\n00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:11.262\n150 or above, if you need it,\nremote assistance.\n\n561\n00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:12.840\nYou can't beat that for onboarding.\n\n562\n00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.450\n>> Yeah, it's nice to get a Microsoft\nkeyboard jockey right there going, okay,\n\n563\n00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:21.040\nclick this, all right, now type that\nin there, move this, turn that, and\n\n564\n00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.090\nyou're off to the races.\n\n565\n00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:26.306\nAnd they will get you moving very quickly,\nthey want you to enjoy their product so\n\n566\n00:32:26.306 --> 00:32:29.845\nthat you'll buy more and\ncontinue to purchase services from them.\n\n567\n00:32:29.845 --> 00:32:32.151\nSo, I'm sure if you are having\nany kind of difficulty,\n\n568\n00:32:32.151 --> 00:32:35.688\neven though what Ronnie has showed us is\npretty straightforward, is pretty simple,\n\n569\n00:32:35.688 --> 00:32:38.680\nif you do have any difficulty,\nthey are there as your safety net.\n\n570\n00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.929\nThey're gonna get you up and\nrunning fairly quickly.\n\n571\n00:32:40.929 --> 00:32:43.740\nRonnie, is there anything else that\nwe need to know when it comes to\n\n572\n00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.553\nplanning a pilot?\n\n573\n00:32:44.553 --> 00:32:48.592\n>> Well, not in terms of just planning\nthe pilot anymore, now it's time for you,\n\n574\n00:32:48.592 --> 00:32:51.940\nyou haven't set it up yet,\nto go ahead and get started.\n\n575\n00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.800\nPractice what you've actually\nlearned here, the very fact that\n\n576\n00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.250\nyou are going to go ahead and\nbegin by creating your pilot account.\n\n577\n00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:04.150\nAnd then from that point, start adding\nin those pilot users and get started,\n\n578\n00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:07.780\nat least seeing that process and exploring\nall those features in the background.\n\n579\n00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.660\nWhen you do that, that will be easier\non the day that you start talking\n\n580\n00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.520\nabout enrolling and\ngetting other people moved on over.\n\n581\n00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.210\nSo that is really the initial plan\nthat we actually do have, and\n\n582\n00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:20.290\nwe take a look at just about every\nfeature in setting up a pilot plan.\n\n583\n00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:21.040\n>> Well, awesome.\n\n584\n00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.848\nThank you so much, Ronnie, for showing us\nhow this works, how we can get our feet\n\n585\n00:33:24.848 --> 00:33:28.432\nwet, go out there and do, like he just\nsaid, create a test plan or test trial\n\n586\n00:33:28.432 --> 00:33:32.408\nwith Office 365, start playing around\nwith it, get some seat time behind it, so\n\n587\n00:33:32.408 --> 00:33:35.178\nyou understand it better and\nyou're ready for that exam.\n\n588\n00:33:35.178 --> 00:33:37.041\nRonnie, thank you again for joining us and\n\n589\n00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:39.440\nshowing us all these cool\nthings about Office 365.\n\n590\n00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.123\nThank you for joining us on our series\nhere, but we're gonna ahead and\n\n591\n00:33:43.123 --> 00:33:44.320\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n592\n00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.900\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n593\n00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.595\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n594\n00:33:46.595 --> 00:33:52.512\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n595\n00:33:52.512 --> 00:33:58.060\n[NOISE]\n\n",

PROTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.270\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode, well, we're continuing on\n\n4\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.580\nwith our Managing Office 365,\nIdentities and Requirements, and, well,\n\n5\n00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.890\njoining me yet again in the studio today\nis my good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.910\nRonnie, welcome back to the show.\n\n7\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.000\nHow are you doing, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.920\n>> I am doing fine.\n\n9\n00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.910\nWe are now moving into a different\ntopic besides planning a pilot.\n\n10\n00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.600\nI know it only took me four episodes but\n\n11\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.540\nyep that's right we're actually\ncontinuing on here and\n\n12\n00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.640\ntoday we're gonna take a look at enabling\nclient connectivity to Office 365.\n\n13\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.620\nNow when we talk about that right we're\n\n14\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.760\nactually making sure that we\ncan connect to Office 365 and\n\n15\n00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.140\nthere are several things that we need to\nmake sure that we do, but you might be\n\n16\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.360\nasking that question that Daniel\nactually asked me right before the show.\n\n17\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.270\nRonnie, what happens though?\n\n18\n00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.600\nIf we're connected to the internet we\nshould be connected to Office 365, right?\n\n19\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.200\n>> I would think.\n\n20\n00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.260\nI mean this is just me, right?\n\n21\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This whole show is about connectivity\n\n22\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.500\nto Office 365.\n\n23\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.220\nLast time I checked Office\n365 is a Cloud service, and\n\n24\n00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.920\nCloud service is by nature are about\nbeing connected through the internet.\n\n25\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.580\nSo as long as I have an active\ninternet connection,\n\n26\n00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.000\nlogic would be safe to say\nthat I am connected, right?\n\n27\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.120\nThe show's over, and\nthanks for watching, right?\n\n28\n00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.190\n>> Yeah.\nYou would think that would be all that\n\n29\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.020\nthere is to do, and if you are actually\na student user, if you're a home user,\n\n30\n00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.730\nif you're using that small business plan,\nyou're probably right.\n\n31\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.870\nThe very fact is, you shouldn't have\nreally any issues as long as you have\n\n32\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.060\na sufficient amount of bandwidth, and you\nhave connectivity out to the internet, and\n\n33\n00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.450\nyou can reach their servers.\n\n34\n00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.910\nWell then you should be ready to go,\nbut the reality of things are,\n\n35\n00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.890\njust the way they actually\nare in most businesses though\n\n36\n00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.140\nthat continue to grow and grow larger.\n\n37\n00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.810\nThose businesses tend to have\nmore control over their networks.\n\n38\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.320\nWhen I talk about more controls,\nI'm talking about different devices,\n\n39\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.840\ndifferent ways that we allow users to\naccess the internet, and that means we\n\n40\n00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.630\nalso have to actually be able to provide\nfor the very fact that those types of\n\n41\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.020\ndevices may cause some hindrances to\nthe connection that we have to Office 365.\n\n42\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.950\nSo when we start to take a look at that,\nwe're going to specifically focus\n\n43\n00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.310\nin on what really, kind of three\ncomponents or two and a half components.\n\n44\n00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.110\nI don't know how best to describe it.\n\n45\n00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.190\nThe first one of course\nis going to be DNS.\n\n46\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.530\nThe very fact is DNS is one of those\nthings that's always important, and\n\n47\n00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.310\neven though we've set it up before.\n\n48\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.600\nWe're gonna take a look at a couple of\nthings that we need to address with DNS to\n\n49\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.690\nensure that we have\nthe perfect connectivity\n\n50\n00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.410\nthat we need between the way\nthat our network's set up, and\n\n51\n00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.010\nof course Office 365 is set\nup depending on our needs.\n\n52\n00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.910\nThen we're gonna talk specifically about\naddressing things like well proxy servers,\n\n53\n00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.680\nand how does that also\nwork out with Office 365,\n\n54\n00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.520\nand the issues that are actually\ninvolved in Office 365, and\n\n55\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.290\nthen, we need to address this kind of\nethereal topic, more than anything else.\n\n56\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.614\nWhich is how many people can\nactually connect to Office 365,\n\n57\n00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:20.080\nyou know, according to my bandwidth\nconnection, and a lot of time we're\n\n58\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.720\nactually addressing things like the very\nfact that we're using something like NAT,\n\n59\n00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.690\nnetwork address translation, and that most\nof the time that means that our entire\n\n60\n00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.270\npresence is actually based\non one IP address, and\n\n61\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.590\nthat means that Office 365 sees not\nmy network of 1500, 2000, 6000 users.\n\n62\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.430\nIt actually sees one IP address as being\nsuper busy, is what it actually sees.\n\n63\n00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.530\nIt doesn't see 6000 people connecting in,\nit sees one person\n\n64\n00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.060\njust essentially cramming as much\nstuff into Office 365 as possible, and\n\n65\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.720\nwhat are the limitations there, and\nhow do we tend to actually be able to know\n\n66\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.020\nwhat those limitations are so we have\nto do a little bit of math as well.\n\n67\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.450\nSo, it's not the easiest\nsubject in the world,\n\n68\n00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.780\nIt's not the hardest one, but\nthere's some terminology that\n\n69\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.560\nyou're going to hear me trip over because\nit actually is kind of a tongue twister.\n\n70\n00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.360\nThere's some other things that we just\nhave to make sure that we understand and\n\n71\n00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.330\ndeal with, and realize that if\nwe're experiencing slow down\n\n72\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.700\nwhat's the issues going to be, and\nhow do we actually address those two?\n\n73\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.130\nSo this particular issue all about making\nsure our clients are trying to get\n\n74\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.200\nthe best possible quality and\nconnection out to Office 365 as they can.\n\n75\n00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.430\nSo let's start off with the issues of DNS,\nonce again, and\n\n76\n00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.700\nsince this is kinda really multiple times\nthat I have actually mentioned three or\n\n77\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.090\nfour at least at this point.\n\n78\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.730\nI hope that this actually means that\nthose of you that are preparing for\n\n79\n00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.370\nthe exam realize how\nimportant this topic is.\n\n80\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.190\nDNS is a big one when you're setting\nthis up and when you're actually doing\n\n81\n00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.540\nthe administration for Office 365 and\ngetting things converted over there.\n\n82\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.350\nSo one of the things that we want to talk\nabout which I didn't address in another\n\n83\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.120\nepisode Is what if, okay,\n\n84\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.370\nthat I want to move my\norganization from my current DNS\n\n85\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.870\nserver as its registrar over to\nOffice 365 and let them handle it.\n\n86\n00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.510\nNow there's a couple of\nthings that you can do.\n\n87\n00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.060\nOkay?\n\n88\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.940\nBut here's the rule of thumb once again.\n\n89\n00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.050\nIf you are actually on an Office\n365 plan that is using\n\n90\n00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.020\nthe small business size types of models,\nor less, and you're still\n\n91\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.140\nusing a DNS registrar out there,well\nthey actually say look, if you want to,\n\n92\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.950\nyou can then say, all right I don't\nwant to ask you how my separate host or\n\n93\n00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.620\nmy separate DNS host, registrar hosts my\nDNS stuff, I want Office 365 to do so.\n\n94\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.760\nPerfectly fine,\nthey want you to be able to do that.\n\n95\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.890\nIf you're doing\nWindows Enterprise accounts,\n\n96\n00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.190\nor mid-size business accounts,\nEnterprise and higher.\n\n97\n00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.260\nThey actually do recommend instead\nthat you host your own DNS instead,\n\n98\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.970\nand leave it on your end\nto be able to manage.\n\n99\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.760\nIt doesn't mean that you can't try and\ndo that, no.\n\n100\n00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.650\nYou definitely can allow Office\n365 to do that, but at this point,\n\n101\n00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.440\nyou don't have a lot of control over\nthose DNS records if you do that, right.\n\n102\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.630\nYou only have control over\nwhatever they want you to do But\n\n103\n00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.370\npretty much that's what\nyou want to have happen.\n\n104\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.700\nSo there's not a lot of customization\nif you handle all that control, but\n\n105\n00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.600\nlet's go ahead and show you what you\nhave to do to get this turn off, okay.\n\n106\n00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.750\nSo, when we talk about the idea of using\nDNS that here on Office 365, okay.\n\n107\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.950\nIf we wanted to turn over control, let's\nsay that I have my own DNS register and\n\n108\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:48.770\nmine is on hover.com here, great company,\nand then if I select my account,\n\n109\n00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.460\nI'm gonna go to domains, and it's right\n\n110\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.840\nhere once everything actually retrieves\nin, that what we're looking for, right.\n\n111\n00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.840\nWe've already created DNS records and\nwe're gonna talk about those DNS records\n\n112\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.495\nhere in a moment, but what I need\nto do is even though currently for\n\n113\n00:07:05.495 --> 00:07:09.140\nitprotvdemo.com, this is my registrar.\n\n114\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.110\nNotice the way that it says\nnameservers right here.\n\n115\n00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.980\nSo my authoritative nameservers\nare right here are for my domain, and\n\n116\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.760\nit's actually ns1.hover.com and\nns2.hover.com.\n\n117\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:27.200\nI want to click edit and from there, what\nI want to do is I want to change these.\n\n118\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.180\nNow, these are actually\nvery specific here.\n\n119\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.450\nI make sure I type it in right.\n\n120\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:40.204\nIt's gonna be ms1.bdm.microsoftonline.com.\n\n121\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.250\nSo I need to make sure I spell that\ncorrectly is what I need to do,\n\n122\n00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.620\nbecause my typing ability, and\nDaniel will attest to this,\n\n123\n00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.250\nis incredibly terrible, and\nthen this one is gonna be NS2.\n\n124\n00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.751\nNow, if I really wanted Office 365 to\nhandle it is this what I want to do?\n\n125\n00:07:58.751 --> 00:07:59.552\nIt is, okay.\n\n126\n00:07:59.552 --> 00:08:04.494\nSo in that small business plan this\nis what you actually do Is that you\n\n127\n00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:09.710\nwould turn that over, and\nthis will begin to set itself in place.\n\n128\n00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.490\nAnd this can take 15 minutes to hours\nbefore everything actually switches over.\n\n129\n00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.740\nBut once it does, all my DNS services will\nnow, the authoritative aspect of DNS for\n\n130\n00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.347\nmy domain name,\nwill be handled through Office 365.\n\n131\n00:08:23.347 --> 00:08:27.916\nSo we've essentially turned over\nthat authority over to Office 365.\n\n132\n00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:31.493\nSo if you go,\nnow I can get rid of this, you can.\n\n133\n00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:35.011\nBut remember that if you're actually\nin that higher level business account,\n\n134\n00:08:35.011 --> 00:08:37.517\nyou probably actually are gonna\nbe adding in records for\n\n135\n00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.503\nother things inside of your organization.\n\n136\n00:08:39.503 --> 00:08:41.127\nAnd remember that Office 365,\n\n137\n00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:44.870\nthey're not gonna give you a console\nto be able to manage everything.\n\n138\n00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.670\nThey really only wanna manage what,\nthe stuff dealing with Office 365.\n\n139\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:53.242\nAnd so, even though you can do that so\nthat people can refer to your domain here,\n\n140\n00:08:53.242 --> 00:08:57.083\nif you need to manage it, you need\nto leave it as is, the way it was.\n\n141\n00:08:57.083 --> 00:09:00.390\nOkay, so that is a clear thing that\nyou have to get clear in your mind.\n\n142\n00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:05.742\nSo remember, the small size business\naccounts, okay to turn over.\n\n143\n00:09:05.742 --> 00:09:10.120\nMidsize to enterprise stuff, don't do\nthat, make sure you host it on your own.\n\n144\n00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.910\nBut that's how you actually do that.\n\n145\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.699\nNow, once you have that done, right,\nyou want to click on DNS here.\n\n146\n00:09:16.699 --> 00:09:21.984\nAnd if Office 365 is a part of what\nyou're doing, you want to make\n\n147\n00:09:21.984 --> 00:09:27.671\nsure those Office 365 records that\nthey need are also stored in here.\n\n148\n00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:31.253\nRemember that one of the very first\nrecords that we actually created,\n\n149\n00:09:31.253 --> 00:09:32.891\nif you haven't checked it out,\n\n150\n00:09:32.891 --> 00:09:36.367\ncheck out the episode on us actually\nestablishing a custom domain.\n\n151\n00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:39.510\nThat we created this text record here.\n\n152\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:44.800\nThat allows for Office 365 to show\nthat we own this domain name, okay?\n\n153\n00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.420\nAnd then, once we did that and\nwe were able to connect,\n\n154\n00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.640\nOffice 365 generated\na bunch of records for us.\n\n155\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.400\nLet me show you those records.\n\n156\n00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.185\nI'm gonna click back here on Office\n365 and go to the Admin console.\n\n157\n00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:03.040\nAnd make sure I put on my glasses so\nthat I can see.\n\n158\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.985\nAnd then, we're gonna go down to\nDomains on the left hand side.\n\n159\n00:10:07.985 --> 00:10:10.783\nAnd inside of Domains,\nhere's my itprotvdemo.\n\n160\n00:10:10.783 --> 00:10:15.310\nRemember that the default account\nis actually the onmicrosoft.com.\n\n161\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.441\nBy adding in that demo, I was able to\nactually change it to my own domain.\n\n162\n00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:21.520\nI'm gonna click on Domain settings.\n\n163\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.300\nAnd it's in Domain\nsettings as I scroll down,\n\n164\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.870\nyou can see that the DNS records\nthat Office 365 has created.\n\n165\n00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.315\nIf I'm in that enterprise and\nthe mid-size or\n\n166\n00:10:35.315 --> 00:10:40.620\nlarger types of accounts, this is where we\nwould take each one of these records and\n\n167\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.400\nwe add them into,\nwell here is what we would do.\n\n168\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.250\nWe would simply add a new record, and so\nall of that, I've actually already done.\n\n169\n00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.940\nWe've added in all these records\nthat it's actually created for us.\n\n170\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.030\nSo here is the one set up for Exchange\nOnline, here is the one set up for\n\n171\n00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.620\nSkype for Business, and of course for\nmobile device management.\n\n172\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:05.660\nEach of these records have been added in\nto my own registrar right here for me.\n\n173\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.930\nSo that's actually something that I\nwanna make sure that we do point out and\n\n174\n00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.570\nunderstand is that we would\nactually be able to do that.\n\n175\n00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.293\nSo remember that when we first added in\nthat custom domain, that's what it did,\n\n176\n00:11:16.293 --> 00:11:17.958\nit generated all that stuff for us.\n\n177\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.779\nAnd so all we do is follow\nthe instructions on our registrar and\n\n178\n00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:24.120\nhow we add in different records.\n\n179\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.920\nAnd we choose that record type, and we\nsimply click Save and then we're off and\n\n180\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.230\nready to go.\n\n181\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.720\nGetting all of that stuff set up,\n\n182\n00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.176\nbeing able to know whether I'm\nactually gonna manage my own DNS or\n\n183\n00:11:34.176 --> 00:11:38.520\nwhether I'm gonna let Office 365, that\nactually is gonna become very much a part\n\n184\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.940\nof ensuring your clients are actually\nable to connect to Office 365.\n\n185\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.919\n>> Now Ronnie, does Microsoft have\na preference on how you use DNS?\n\n186\n00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:52.125\nDo they prefer you to implement their\nOffice 365 DNS or do they realize,\n\n187\n00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:56.488\nyes if you need management, you should\nstick with your own hosted solution?\n\n188\n00:11:56.488 --> 00:11:59.084\n>> Yeah, if you know that you're\ngonna be adding additional services,\n\n189\n00:11:59.084 --> 00:12:01.640\nthey recommend you stick with your own,\nokay?\n\n190\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.000\nIf you're a small business or\n\n191\n00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.790\nyou have your personal website,\nthey go, we can have that.\n\n192\n00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.253\nWe can handle redirecting and\ngiving out a name.\n\n193\n00:12:10.253 --> 00:12:13.847\nBut if you know you gonna be providing\nservers and services in the background,\n\n194\n00:12:13.847 --> 00:12:17.370\nserver records and you gonna be\ndoing other things, can you do it?\n\n195\n00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.569\nPossibly, but in Office 365 they're\nprobably not gonna point to anything\n\n196\n00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:22.220\ninternal on to your network.\n\n197\n00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.620\nSo that's why you, instead, would want\nto actually keep your own as well.\n\n198\n00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.505\nSo remember, the rule of thumb is simple.\n\n199\n00:12:28.505 --> 00:12:32.591\nThat midsize or\nabove you host your own, you manage it.\n\n200\n00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:35.457\nMidsize or lower,\nactually I should say lower than midsize,\n\n201\n00:12:35.457 --> 00:12:38.520\nthen turn it over to Office 365,\nyou're probably fine.\n\n202\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.420\n>> Awesome, now Ronnie, you did mention\nback when we first started this little\n\n203\n00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.140\nepisode here, something a little\nbit about proxy servers.\n\n204\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.040\nNow, that's not something you\nthink about on a day-to-day basis,\n\n205\n00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.120\nto be honest with you.\n\n206\n00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:55.610\nBut, some companies do implement proxy\nservers for the purposes of well,\n\n207\n00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.510\nfiltering and firewalling even,\nand trying to keep people safe.\n\n208\n00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.660\nSo, you might encounter this\nout in a wild solution, rIght?\n\n209\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.550\n>> You probably are.\n\n210\n00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.950\nI you're actually in, let's take for\nan example a school scenario, right?\n\n211\n00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.010\nYou're support that school at that point.\n\n212\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.350\nWell, at least I believe, in every\nschool situation that I've ever seen or\n\n213\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.630\nconsulted on, the very fact is,\nthey don't allow their students to just\n\n214\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.860\nconnect out to the Internet\nwhenever they want to.\n\n215\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.605\nWhat normally ends up happening,\nis that they go, all right,\n\n216\n00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:23.500\nwe're gonna set up our own proxy server.\n\n217\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.580\nAnd that way, not only can they\nfilter out the traffic, even better,\n\n218\n00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.310\nthey can monitor the traffic, right?\n\n219\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.410\nThey have the ability to be able to take\nthat one machine that everybody's actually\n\n220\n00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.700\nconnecting through to monitor.\n\n221\n00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.630\nSo let me show you how that works\nif you're not exactly sure here.\n\n222\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.957\nI made a little diagram,\nif I can find it on my machine\n\n223\n00:13:40.957 --> 00:13:46.417\nvery quickly here, pull it up so\nthat we can see this.\n\n224\n00:13:46.417 --> 00:13:48.729\nAll right, so in this particular diagram,\n\n225\n00:13:48.729 --> 00:13:51.861\nlooks like I didn't zoom it in\nenough here, let me zoom in.\n\n226\n00:13:51.861 --> 00:13:53.515\nAnd you actually see three different, or\n\n227\n00:13:53.515 --> 00:13:56.320\nfour different elements\naltogether when you take a look.\n\n228\n00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.750\nHere, of course, are the servers\nout on the Internet for Office365.\n\n229\n00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.840\nThere, of course, are more than other\nthings out there besides Office365 so,\n\n230\n00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.300\nother web servers, and\nother websites that are out there.\n\n231\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.520\nAnd then over here on the left hand side,\nessentially, is my organization, right,\n\n232\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.970\nthe itprotvdemo.com clients\nthat I have hosted in.\n\n233\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:18.331\nIf I select a proxy server, what that\nactually allows me to do just about for\n\n234\n00:14:18.331 --> 00:14:21.447\nall of my web traffic and\njust about everything else,\n\n235\n00:14:21.447 --> 00:14:26.177\nis that we really do not directly connect\nto any of these servers out here, okay.\n\n236\n00:14:26.177 --> 00:14:30.391\nWhat I do is I make a request,\nlet's say for ITProTV, okay.\n\n237\n00:14:30.391 --> 00:14:33.691\nAnd if that's actually a totally\ndifferent organization than my demo,\n\n238\n00:14:33.691 --> 00:14:35.702\nit could be that it goes\nto the proxy server.\n\n239\n00:14:35.702 --> 00:14:39.166\nThe proxy server is the one\nthat makes the request out, and\n\n240\n00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:43.130\nit is the one that receives\nthe response that comes back.\n\n241\n00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:47.467\nAnd then it caches it there on the server\nand allows it to return back to me.\n\n242\n00:14:47.467 --> 00:14:52.794\nAnd that's actually a great thing because\nin the majority of things that we do,\n\n243\n00:14:52.794 --> 00:14:57.247\nsomething like this really does\nhelp to actually speed up things,\n\n244\n00:14:57.247 --> 00:15:00.124\nat least from the client side end, right.\n\n245\n00:15:00.124 --> 00:15:02.943\nBecause once it's cached\nhere on this server,\n\n246\n00:15:02.943 --> 00:15:07.241\nany of these other machines then that\ngo to ITProTV, once they go there,\n\n247\n00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:11.267\nthey don't really have to actually\nreach out to that server again.\n\n248\n00:15:11.267 --> 00:15:14.870\nThey're simply accessing that\nproxy server and its cache, and\n\n249\n00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.883\nit's returning them in lickety-split time,\nI mean, no time at all.\n\n250\n00:15:18.883 --> 00:15:20.748\nWhy, because as you go\nacross the Internet,\n\n251\n00:15:20.748 --> 00:15:24.051\nyou don't have a clue where it's gonna\nbottleneck and how slow it's gonna be.\n\n252\n00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:27.690\nBut I know, let's say for example that\nthis is a entire gigabit network.\n\n253\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.194\nI'm accessing that server at a gigabit,\nI'm getting a return at a gigabit.\n\n254\n00:15:31.194 --> 00:15:32.095\nYou can't ask for\n\n255\n00:15:32.095 --> 00:15:36.180\na ton better than that if you're actually\ninside of a gigabit type of network.\n\n256\n00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:40.710\nEven a 100 MB network,\npretty fast when you start doing that.\n\n257\n00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.017\nWell, when we start doing this, right, and\n\n258\n00:15:43.017 --> 00:15:46.123\nif this is the standard operating\nprocedure for my network.\n\n259\n00:15:46.123 --> 00:15:49.715\nWell, remember that portal.office.com,\nright,\n\n260\n00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:55.310\nour main interface getting into Office\n365, is essentially a web server.\n\n261\n00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.665\nSo when I make that request, well,\n\n262\n00:15:56.665 --> 00:15:58.932\nnotice that I'm actually\nhitting the proxy server again.\n\n263\n00:15:58.932 --> 00:16:01.585\nThe proxy server's actually getting that,\n\n264\n00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:05.782\ngoing to Office 365 servers that's\nout there, wherever they are.\n\n265\n00:16:05.782 --> 00:16:08.046\n>> And then,\nreturning that request to a proxy server.\n\n266\n00:16:08.046 --> 00:16:12.510\nAnd it, too, is caching the information,\nand then coming back to me as well.\n\n267\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.870\nAnd you're probably saying,\nwell, all right, so\n\n268\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.450\nthat actually sounds pretty good.\n\n269\n00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.700\nSo, what's the actual issues here?\n\n270\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.150\nWell, the issues\nare actually fairly simple.\n\n271\n00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.670\nThere's nothing that the proxy server does\nthat really enhances that experience for\n\n272\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.440\nOffice 365.\n\n273\n00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.860\nAnd the reason why is that,\nthere is actually several reasons here.\n\n274\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.980\nLet me make sure that I\ntell you the first one.\n\n275\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.540\nOkay.\nThe reason why we actually use something\n\n276\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.540\nlike the proxy server, like we told you,\nwe can filter, we can do a lot of things.\n\n277\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.840\nA lot of times it's actually\nabout monitoring the traffic and\n\n278\n00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.050\nseeing the traffic that we have.\n\n279\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.190\nBut when we actually\nconnect out to Office 365,\n\n280\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.150\nall of the content's actually encrypted.\n\n281\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.360\nSo, firewalls don't actually\ninspect encrypted traffic at all.\n\n282\n00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.040\nSo, it's not gonna really help, too.\n\n283\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.180\nAnd proxy servers,\nthey don't take a look at it and go,\n\n284\n00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.600\nokay, well, that's encrypted.\n\n285\n00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.860\nSo, it's just caching it.\n\n286\n00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.770\nAnd then,\nit's actually returning it along.\n\n287\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:06.540\nThe other thing, of course, is that it\nsays that, at least from Office 365's\n\n288\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.170\nstandpoint, caching does nothing\nactually to increase the performance.\n\n289\n00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.240\nWhy?\nBecause every connection that you make,\n\n290\n00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.865\nevery session that you make,\nis actually gonna be different.\n\n291\n00:17:14.865 --> 00:17:15.960\nOkay?\nSo,\n\n292\n00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.800\nyou do have some things there that\nthe proxy server essentially is gonna\n\n293\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.585\nslow down because it's now another\ndevice that we have to pass through.\n\n294\n00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:26.600\nAnd Office 365 is a bandwidth\n\n295\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.550\nintensive type of connection\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n296\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.380\nSo the more and more connections\nthat are made, more than likely,\n\n297\n00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.490\nthe faster you'll probably fill\nup the cache on that proxy server\n\n298\n00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.410\nis probably one of things that\nyou also end up doing as well.\n\n299\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.140\nOkay?\n\n300\n00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.340\nThe other thing that also\nhappens here with a proxy server\n\n301\n00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.525\nis that it can actually become\nvery constricted in this way.\n\n302\n00:17:45.525 --> 00:17:46.330\nOkay?\n\n303\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.890\nProxy servers are good when you actually\nneed to make one connection and then come\n\n304\n00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.230\nback, and you're not actually making\na constant connection over that server and\n\n305\n00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.820\nmaintaining that connection.\n\n306\n00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.690\nOkay?\n\n307\n00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.470\nBut once you actually don't have that,\nand that's what happens here is,\n\n308\n00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.530\nwhen we connect Office 365, it's\na constant flow of traffic that actually\n\n309\n00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:10.240\nhappens between the clients as\nwell as the actual Office 365.\n\n310\n00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.690\nAnd that means that, well,\nyou actually have to establish more and\n\n311\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.230\nmore port connections.\n\n312\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.644\nWell, there's only a limited amount of\nports that you have available to you.\n\n313\n00:18:18.644 --> 00:18:23.700\nSo, it might be that you actually end\nup running out of port connections.\n\n314\n00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.400\nAnd when that happens that means that\nsomebody else is gonna get kicked off.\n\n315\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.040\nIf you're not gonna get kicked off.\n\n316\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.150\nOr it's gonna become very\nslow in what you have.\n\n317\n00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.375\nSo, there's a lot of different things that\ncan also end up happening with the way\n\n318\n00:18:34.375 --> 00:18:36.560\nthat proxy servers end up working.\n\n319\n00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.449\nBecause we actually establish long time\nconnections, anytime, if you think about\n\n320\n00:18:41.449 --> 00:18:44.840\nit, right, that the proxy servers\ndecide it's gonna drop off something,\n\n321\n00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.250\nit's gonna drop it off for everyone\nof your users on Office 365 as well.\n\n322\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:54.650\nSo, there are a bunch of different reasons\nwhy you wouldn't want to use a proxy\n\n323\n00:18:54.650 --> 00:19:00.130\nserver in between you and,\nof course, Office 365.\n\n324\n00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.670\nIdeally, this is the way that you\nwould actually want to do this.\n\n325\n00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:04.380\nOkay?\n\n326\n00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.530\nIs that maybe for\nevery other website that you go to,\n\n327\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.810\nbecause it's part of your security,\nyou essentially want to say,\n\n328\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.960\nlook, we want everything else to\nreally be able to go through and\n\n329\n00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.690\nbe able to run through that proxy server,\nbut we essentially need the proxy server\n\n330\n00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.610\nto really ignore this traffic\nthat goes to Office 365.\n\n331\n00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.820\nSo, when you do something like that,\n\n332\n00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.990\nwe talked about the idea\nof bypassing the proxy.\n\n333\n00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.880\nNow, in doing that,\nthat now becomes, you're like, well,\n\n334\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.830\nis that a security risk?\n\n335\n00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:37.270\nWell, not because of traffic between\nOffice 365 and your clients.\n\n336\n00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.210\nCuz all that traffic's actually encrypted.\n\n337\n00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.480\nThe majority of that happens on port\n80 when you first get to the initial\n\n338\n00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.400\nportal page.\n\n339\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.070\nBut once you actually\nmake that connection,\n\n340\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.220\nthat actually flips on over to 443.\n\n341\n00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.430\nSo, you are actually encrypted\nthe whole time as you're actually\n\n342\n00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.890\nconnected right there.\n\n343\n00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.540\nSo, you have that ability to do so\nif you're already using a proxy server.\n\n344\n00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.070\nThe other one is to actually\nsend it out another gateway.\n\n345\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.880\nBut this is where a problem comes in, and\nwe were just talking about this, right?\n\n346\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.250\nThat the problem is, what was it Daniel?\n\n347\n00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.420\nThe problem is that we\ncan send it out one,\n\n348\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.140\nbut then it might come back on,\nwhat, on another.\n\n349\n00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.770\nAnd that's where you also have\ndisconnected problems, too.\n\n350\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.050\n>> Yeah.\nYou don't want to run\n\n351\n00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:12.030\ninto that issue, though.\n\n352\n00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.590\nThe better way to go is exactly\nwhat Ronnie is showing you here,\n\n353\n00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:19.050\nwhich is send all your other traffic\nthrough your proxy server, and\n\n354\n00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.160\nthen bypass the proxy server when\nit comes to accessing Office 365.\n\n355\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.490\nYou don't have to worry about the security\nissue, because like Ronnie said,\n\n356\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.690\nthat entire conversation is gonna\nbe encrypted using TLS or SSL.\n\n357\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.760\nSo that's all good to go.\n\n358\n00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.280\nYou don't have to worry about it.\n\n359\n00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.200\nAnd you're not picking up\nany performance benefit from\n\n360\n00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.800\nthe caching benefits of the proxy server.\n\n361\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.900\nSo doesn't really even make sense.\n\n362\n00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.670\nAnd that really,\n\n363\n00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:45.900\nwhat you're looking at is, you're gonna\nhave more headaches than you are helps\n\n364\n00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.970\nwhen it comes to trying to go through\nthe proxy server to get to Office 365.\n\n365\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.580\nBetter idea,\njust bypass all the way around it.\n\n366\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.161\nSet up those rules to make that happen.\n\n367\n00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:56.880\nAnd everything else you can\nfilter through your proxy.\n\n368\n00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.429\n>> All right.\n\n369\n00:20:57.429 --> 00:21:01.956\nSo, let's take a look at a generic way\nthat this can be done here, right?\n\n370\n00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:04.631\nSo, I've got actually two\nthings going on on my network.\n\n371\n00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:05.720\nOkay?\n\n372\n00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.640\nSo, here on my server I've got\nan actual proxy server running.\n\n373\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.200\nAnd, of course, I've timed out again.\n\n374\n00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.660\nThe all of five seconds that it\nactually gives me to be able to\n\n375\n00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.630\nwork without the actual\nlock screen coming on.\n\n376\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.280\nSo, I installed this free proxy, okay?\n\n377\n00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.740\nAnd everything essentially is coming\nthrough this particular proxy\n\n378\n00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.190\nserver right here.\n\n379\n00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:31.480\nSo, when I go to a web page and I connect,\nit is actually connecting through,\n\n380\n00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.876\nlet me make sure that I'm\ntelling you the truth here.\n\n381\n00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:36.930\nIT Pro TV.\n\n382\n00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.220\nSo, it's actually gonna connect through.\n\n383\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.150\nAnd you actually see where it\nactually pulls everything in.\n\n384\n00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.280\nAnd when it does it,\n\n385\n00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.400\nit's actually connecting through\nthat little proxy server.\n\n386\n00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.850\nNow, how do I know that?\n\n387\n00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.800\nIf I click on this gear, oh, well, maybe.\n\n388\n00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.339\nClick on the gear, and\nthen go to Internet Options.\n\n389\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:59.230\nUnder My Internet Options,\nI can select options.\n\n390\n00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.760\nAnd then, LAN Settings.\n\n391\n00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.430\nOnce I do that, you actually see where\nthe proxy server has been configured here.\n\n392\n00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.360\nUser proxy server for your LAN.\n\n393\n00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.030\nAnd there it is.\n\n394\n00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:13.360\nHere is the IP address for my other\nserver, and it's going across this page.\n\n395\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.890\nNow, if I was actually\ntrying to browse for\n\n396\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.410\na computer inside of my network\nthat says bypass it, okay.\n\n397\n00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:19.450\nSo, that's what we want.\n\n398\n00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.294\nBut we don't want to bypass it for\nthings inside.\n\n399\n00:22:21.294 --> 00:22:23.859\nI wanna bypass it for things,\nwell, outside of that.\n\n400\n00:22:23.859 --> 00:22:25.000\nOkay?\n\n401\n00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.050\nNow, there's a couple of\nways we can do this, and\n\n402\n00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.200\nit almost looks esactly the same here.\n\n403\n00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.190\nIf I click on advanced right here, notice\nthat every port's actually the same.\n\n404\n00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.635\nSo, it says use the same proxy for\nall the protocols.\n\n405\n00:22:36.635 --> 00:22:39.025\nOkay?\nSo, that means everything is actually\n\n406\n00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:41.280\ngoing through that one proxy server.\n\n407\n00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.665\nBut, notice the exceptions.\n\n408\n00:22:42.665 --> 00:22:43.620\nOkay?\n\n409\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.830\nIt's right here that we can type in\nthat list of addresses that we need.\n\n410\n00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.370\nAnd you might be saying, well,\nwhat is the list of addresses?\n\n411\n00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.568\nWell, if I scroll,\nlet me see if I can get to my.\n\n412\n00:22:52.568 --> 00:22:54.830\nThere it is.\n\n413\n00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.210\nIf you can go and\nuse your favorite search engine,\n\n414\n00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:01.500\nyou can actually do the Office\n365 URLs and IP address ranges.\n\n415\n00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.420\nAnd there are several of them that you\nwant to make sure that you get in here.\n\n416\n00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.270\nNow, there's are a couple of different\nthings that you have to pay attention to.\n\n417\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.952\nOne, of course, are things like firewall\nrules that you have to make sure that\n\n418\n00:23:11.952 --> 00:23:13.060\nare allowed to get through.\n\n419\n00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.580\nSo, they give you these port numbers\nthat you want to make sure of.\n\n420\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:22.460\nBut there are a lot of IP addresses\ndepending on what your network would need.\n\n421\n00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:28.280\nSo, notice they show you entire ranges of\nIP addresses depending on your servers.\n\n422\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.260\nAnd you can see,\nI'm just scrolling through.\n\n423\n00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.230\nAnd that's a lot.\n\n424\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.540\n>> And that's just for Office 365, right?\n\n425\n00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.484\n>> That's just for Office 365,\nand that's not Exchange.\n\n426\n00:23:35.484 --> 00:23:36.310\nOkay?\n\n427\n00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.460\n>> So, you can go in there and\nactually type in those addresses.\n\n428\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.700\nNow, there's a recommendation here.\n\n429\n00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.470\nEven though they actually show\nsome of them as being ranges,\n\n430\n00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.190\nthey really don't recommend\nthat you use the ranges.\n\n431\n00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.060\nThey really recommend that if\nyou're gonna add in anything use\n\n432\n00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.620\nthe individual IP addresses instead.\n\n433\n00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.480\nApparently, the ranges do not work as\nwell in the way to bypass to proxies.\n\n434\n00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.814\nSo, you can actually take those and\nadd them in, too.\n\n435\n00:24:01.814 --> 00:24:05.247\nNow, you might say, well,\nyou're doing that on one machine, well,\n\n436\n00:24:05.247 --> 00:24:07.320\nhow would you do that for\nall the machines?\n\n437\n00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.579\nWell you can do that in\ncouple of different ways but\n\n438\n00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:14.693\nthe easiest way I like it is by\nusing the group policy setting and\n\n439\n00:24:14.693 --> 00:24:17.890\nthat sets it up through\nyour Internet Explorer.\n\n440\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.730\nSo depending on how you like to set this\nstuff that's what it comes down to, right?\n\n441\n00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.260\nThey're not saying that you can't do it\non your proxy if you don't want to, but\n\n442\n00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.950\nhere, I can go ahead and\nset this up inside of my domain, and\n\n443\n00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.340\nI'll show you the same view\nI was talking about here.\n\n444\n00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:39.032\nAnd this is actually under User,\nand it's under Preferences, and\n\n445\n00:24:39.032 --> 00:24:43.960\nControl Panel, and Internet Setting,\nand it's also right here.\n\n446\n00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.277\nSo then, notice it actually is the same\nand now this one is set up for\n\n447\n00:24:47.277 --> 00:24:50.550\nInternet Explorer 10, but\nit actually worked on 11 as well.\n\n448\n00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:55.780\nAnd then,\nonce I get here to the connections page,\n\n449\n00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.041\nLAN settings, and I click on Advanced.\n\n450\n00:24:59.041 --> 00:25:02.836\nNotice I can actually type in those\nsame things right here too, copy and\n\n451\n00:25:02.836 --> 00:25:05.251\npaste is the way I would\ngo if I was doing that.\n\n452\n00:25:05.251 --> 00:25:08.111\nBut yeah you can actually do that\nthe hard part is getting all these\n\n453\n00:25:08.111 --> 00:25:11.050\nwith semicolons in between to\nseparate out the addresses.\n\n454\n00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.538\nBut that way it actually allows for\nthose connections come in now,\n\n455\n00:25:13.538 --> 00:25:17.200\non that webpage it's actually\nevery single end point connection.\n\n456\n00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.930\nYou may find that you don't need that\nmany, you may actually go ahead and\n\n457\n00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.620\njust do a few of them instead.\n\n458\n00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.560\nBut it's the combination of using that,\nthat actually allows for\n\n459\n00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:31.810\nyou to bypass your proxy server for\nOffice 365 but it leaves what?\n\n460\n00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.220\nEverything else actually\ngoing to your proxy and\n\n461\n00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.090\nthat's probably a better connection for\nwhat you want to do.\n\n462\n00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:41.933\nNow, before we move on from that,\nwe do need to talk about some of this\n\n463\n00:25:41.933 --> 00:25:47.460\ndifferent ports that are also things that\nwe want to make sure that we address.\n\n464\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.687\nA lot of times it's going\nto be your firewall,\n\n465\n00:25:49.687 --> 00:25:51.840\nis where you're going to come in.\n\n466\n00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.810\nAnd notice that the majority of this\nstuff, we probably already have set up.\n\n467\n00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.750\nIf we set up the pilot,\n\n468\n00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.950\nwe're probably already doing\nI map relaying as well, okay?\n\n469\n00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.607\nIf we had everything set up we\nmight also be forwarding email for\n\n470\n00:26:05.607 --> 00:26:08.720\nour pilot users all ready and\ndoing the mail routing.\n\n471\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.926\nAnd if we can connect to the Office portal\nto log in we do have port 443 as well\n\n472\n00:26:14.926 --> 00:26:21.780\nas port 80 open so you probably have a lot\nof this actually open and ready to go.\n\n473\n00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.360\nA few other ones here, of course,\nis the secure POP server.\n\n474\n00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.620\nIf that's the type of\nemail you want to run.\n\n475\n00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.280\nAnd things for like Azure AD and\nExchange Management Console and stuff.\n\n476\n00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.170\nYou do need to add those in.\n\n477\n00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.220\nAs you add in those additional services,\n\n478\n00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.810\nthat we were talking about in our\nprevious episode, the Office 365 service\n\n479\n00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:44.620\ndescriptions, a lot of this has to do of\ncourse with the two way communication.\n\n480\n00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:50.590\nNow inside right now of Office\n365 the term that we use,\n\n481\n00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.900\nthe current version is what we\ncall Skype for Business, okay.\n\n482\n00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.490\nThe older term is called Lync,\nit's what it's called.\n\n483\n00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.990\nAnd so if you actually take\na look at Microsoft Office and\n\n484\n00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.900\nthey talk about the port numbers,\nyou'll still see them called Lync\n\n485\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.950\neven though today we call it Skype for\nBusiness, that's what we call it.\n\n486\n00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.460\nSo if you get confused by that, don't be.\n\n487\n00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.280\nJust associate Lync for\nSkype for Business in your mind.\n\n488\n00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.250\nIf you do that on the exam,\nI put this one one there.\n\n489\n00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.190\nBut you'd never know which one\nyou're gonna end up seeing.\n\n490\n00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.630\nSo make sure you can equate\neither one in that way.\n\n491\n00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:27.760\nSo this came from the official Microsoft\nsite and that's why I put it this way.\n\n492\n00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.660\nSo those are some of the filters\nyou may also want to consider.\n\n493\n00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.820\nNow there's a couple of other things that\nyou will also need to consider as well.\n\n494\n00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.070\nLet me set that up here on the screen so\nthat we can see everything.\n\n495\n00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.950\nOne of them is gonna be what we\ncall hostname-based filtering.\n\n496\n00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:47.280\nSo even though we can actually set up IP\naddresses to filter by on our firewall\n\n497\n00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.730\na lot of times, there are some that\nwe don't want to that with, and\n\n498\n00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:54.190\nthat's why we have to do what we can\ncall a host name based filtering.\n\n499\n00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.100\nSo these particular locations here,\n\n500\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.346\nespecially if you take\na look at Outlook.com.\n\n501\n00:27:58.346 --> 00:28:02.110\nOutlook.com, if you go into Office 365,\nand you click on Outlook\n\n502\n00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:06.740\nit's gonna bring up what looks like\nOutlook, and that's what it's gonna do.\n\n503\n00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.150\nWell there's the connection that you and\nI have to be able to get the email and\n\n504\n00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:16.490\nto retrieve the email and all of\nthat is done securely over port 443.\n\n505\n00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:20.791\nBut there's a lot of elements on\nthat page though, the background,\n\n506\n00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:25.180\nlittle buttons and stuff like that\nthat are not sent securely, okay?\n\n507\n00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.710\nTell you the truth,\nthey're not even stored at Office 365.\n\n508\n00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.590\nThey're stored somewhere\non third party providers.\n\n509\n00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.520\nSo when you do connect in for Outlook 365,\n\n510\n00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.130\nyou're connecting to multiple servers\naround the world at the same time.\n\n511\n00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:40.390\nThe secure connection, of course,\nis retrieving your data and coming back.\n\n512\n00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.839\nBut the things like the buttons and\nthe way that everything actually looks and\n\n513\n00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:45.920\nis set up is coming from\nthird party websites.\n\n514\n00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.426\nWell those third party websites are\nconstantly changing those IP addresses, so\n\n515\n00:28:50.426 --> 00:28:54.667\ninstead they recommend that you actually\nuse these links right here to add in\n\n516\n00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:58.071\nto your filtering to allow for\nthat content to come through.\n\n517\n00:28:58.071 --> 00:29:02.780\nAnd you not have to worry about tracking\nevery single one of those IP addresses.\n\n518\n00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.480\nNow there's only one other thing I\nwanna show you about the ports here,\n\n519\n00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.320\nbefore I go away is,\nif you're used to using an RSS feed,\n\n520\n00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.590\nthis is the best way for\nyou to check if anything's changed.\n\n521\n00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.290\nYou subscribe to their RSS feed, okay?\n\n522\n00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.430\nThat is absolutely the best and\nthe fastest way you'll get it.\n\n523\n00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.700\nIf they make a change on this webpage,\nit's gonna show up in the RSS feed.\n\n524\n00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:29.100\nYou can wait and see if the addresses have\nchanged, but you want to know when it\n\n525\n00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.570\nactually instantaneously changes because\nwe're consistently adding in more or\n\n526\n00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.650\ntheir changing it because of\nthe way that the politics work.\n\n527\n00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.800\nWhatever ends up happening\naround the world,\n\n528\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.580\nthat's what you also\nwanna pay attention to.\n\n529\n00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:44.200\nSo, be willing to subscribe to the RSS\nfeed and that way if you do need to\n\n530\n00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.090\nchange something in your proxy servers\nas far as those settings go for\n\n531\n00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.810\nexceptions you can actually use\nthat to help you out as well.\n\n532\n00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:57.560\nSo, that is essentially the idea of\nhaving to deal with the proxy server.\n\n533\n00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.490\nI'd love to tell you that there's\none simple rule that you can add,\n\n534\n00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.420\nmake one exception that works but\nthere's not, right?\n\n535\n00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.140\nSo their recommendation\nespecially from Microsoft or\n\n536\n00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:11.430\nfrom Office 365 is saying, the easiest\nthing is if you didn't have it, okay?\n\n537\n00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:15.220\nBut if your organization says no,\nwe want our proxy server.\n\n538\n00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.038\nWell, they're saying that,\nuser proxy server for everything else.\n\n539\n00:30:18.038 --> 00:30:22.250\nSee a way and use something\nlike this to bypass those for\n\n540\n00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.280\nyour Office 365 connections.\n\n541\n00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.220\n>> That's right, now, one of the other\nthings that you need to take into\n\n542\n00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.180\naccount when it comes\nto connectivity issue.\n\n543\n00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.960\nIt's the age, tried and true, you're gonna\nencounter this anytime behind the scenes\n\n544\n00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.020\nas an admin, is bandwidth limitations.\n\n545\n00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.230\nAnd no truer is it going to be\nthan with Office 365 because,\n\n546\n00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:46.300\nRonnie, like you said before, this is\na bandwidth intensive suite, am I correct?\n\n547\n00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.100\n>> It is insanely intensive, right?\n\n548\n00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.520\nAs you're connected, it's connected\nto your email constantly, right?\n\n549\n00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.500\nIf you're using Skype for\nBusiness that means somebody can actually\n\n550\n00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.730\nplop up on your screen and\nyou can actually be in a Skype session and\n\n551\n00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.880\nif you're also using it for\nyour phone, it's also coming through.\n\n552\n00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.860\nAnd then you have your email.\n\n553\n00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.470\nThis is a pretty intensive type\nof connection that you have.\n\n554\n00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.730\nSo when it comes down to it, there's\na couple of things that will happen.\n\n555\n00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:16.180\nRemember that most of the time, for\njust a single user let me go ahead and\n\n556\n00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.300\nshow you my screen there,\nI put up some facts so\n\n557\n00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.130\nthat we could pay attention\na little bit easier here okay.\n\n558\n00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:25.360\nBe aware of these two things right,\nthere's gonna be at least two connections\n\n559\n00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:31.570\nper client at a minimum for\nyou to connect to Office 365.\n\n560\n00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.230\nNow you're saying, what does that matter?\n\n561\n00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.140\nWell, remember that I told you that at the\nbeginning if we're using something like\n\n562\n00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.580\nNAT, Network Address Translation, well,\n\n563\n00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.500\nwe have a limited number\nof ports that we can use.\n\n564\n00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.460\nEvery user inside you're organization\nis going to take at least two,\n\n565\n00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.450\nmay take more than that, but\nit may take two of those ports here, okay?\n\n566\n00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.887\nSo because most companies\nare using private IP addresses\n\n567\n00:31:51.887 --> 00:31:55.390\nthat are also in use with NAT,\nremember what NAT does.\n\n568\n00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.481\nIt allows me to take those\nprivate IP addresses and\n\n569\n00:31:58.481 --> 00:32:02.315\ntranslate them into, usually,\na single public IP address.\n\n570\n00:32:02.315 --> 00:32:06.311\nAnd when we talk about something like\nthat, there is a limitation between how\n\n571\n00:32:06.311 --> 00:32:09.768\nmany port connections That a single,\npublic IP address can have.\n\n572\n00:32:09.768 --> 00:32:14.291\nIt's actually 65,534.\n\n573\n00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:15.502\nThere's actually that.\n\n574\n00:32:15.502 --> 00:32:19.643\nBut the very fact is, there's a lot of\nother restricted ports that are also out\n\n575\n00:32:19.643 --> 00:32:21.040\nthere that we cannot use.\n\n576\n00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.790\nSo, Microsoft or Office 365 kinda says,\nokay, here's a generic number.\n\n577\n00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:31.930\nLet's just say that Nat will use about\n64,000 possible addresses that we have.\n\n578\n00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.280\nSo you can count all the way up to 65 if\nyou want to, but they're kind of just\n\n579\n00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:41.340\nrounding it off to make the numbers\neasier, is what it helps us to do here.\n\n580\n00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.440\nSo a single client that's using\nOffice 365 and other connections\n\n581\n00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.470\nthat are out there on the internet,\nit can actually use multiple port numbers.\n\n582\n00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:54.250\nSo all of a sudden, it could be\nthat a single user uses 20, 30,\n\n583\n00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.570\n40 ports per user, okay?\n\n584\n00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.520\nAnd if you have 1,000 of users,\n\n585\n00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.250\nall of a sudden that number now\nbecomes even smaller, okay?\n\n586\n00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:06.220\nSo that's why you actually have to worry\nabout this, so when you actually have to\n\n587\n00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:10.950\ndo this, you need to be able to determine\nthen, how many public IP addresses are you\n\n588\n00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:15.370\nreally gonna need to be able to support\nOffice 365, if you're using that.\n\n589\n00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:19.190\nI know that that sounds strange but\nyou need to be able to term this, for\n\n590\n00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.770\nthose of you that are getting ready for\nthe exam.\n\n591\n00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:25.720\nYou have to have at least the basic\nknowledge of this mathematical process.\n\n592\n00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.640\nThey're not the hardest math in the world.\n\n593\n00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.320\nBut at the same,\n\n594\n00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.740\nit's just having to remember all\nthe stuff that you got to remember, okay?\n\n595\n00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:39.710\nSo if we start off with this number here,\n64,000 possible ports per single address.\n\n596\n00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:41.950\nThen you can go in and\n\n597\n00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.240\nsay, all right, here's what an operating\nsystem will essentially do.\n\n598\n00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.417\nThe operating will say it will take\nup about 4,000 of those ports.\n\n599\n00:33:49.417 --> 00:33:51.780\nThose are what we call\nthe restricted ports.\n\n600\n00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.210\nSo that leaves you with about\n60,000 ports over here.\n\n601\n00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.030\nThat's what that happens here.\n\n602\n00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.650\nYou take the available ports,\nwhich about 64,000,\n\n603\n00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:05.190\nyou subtract out what's actually\ngonna be the restricted ones.\n\n604\n00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.542\nSo this one is restricted,\nlet's say, by the operating system.\n\n605\n00:34:07.542 --> 00:34:12.800\nWe'll say 4,000 of those can be taken\nout there, so that gives me 60,000.\n\n606\n00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.830\nThen, every user, okay, and\n\n607\n00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:22.587\nthis is where I said that the alliteration\nis gonna kill me, peak port consumption,\n\n608\n00:34:22.587 --> 00:34:25.560\nI wanna say pork,\nbecause I like eating pork.\n\n609\n00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.376\n>> Who doesn't?\n>> Yeah.\n\n610\n00:34:26.376 --> 00:34:28.501\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Peak port consumption,\n\n611\n00:34:28.501 --> 00:34:30.470\nwell what does that mean?\n\n612\n00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:34.470\nThat means every user,\nespecially when going to Office 365,\n\n613\n00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:38.730\nlet's say that we believe that they're\ngonna take a maximum of six ports.\n\n614\n00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:45.290\nA maximum of six ports is what\nthey might do per user here, okay.\n\n615\n00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:50.740\nAt any one time, this is your\npeak port factor, in other words,\n\n616\n00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:54.650\nhow many, when they actually connect in,\nwhat is the possibility at that peak time\n\n617\n00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:58.230\nthat it's gonna do, let's say it's\ngonna be four connections at one time.\n\n618\n00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.430\nSo you add those together.\n\n619\n00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:02.570\nEach one can actually do six and\nthen at any one time,\n\n620\n00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:06.130\nevery person that's actually connected,\nevery device that's connected.\n\n621\n00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:08.670\nWe think it's really gonna\nmaximize out at four.\n\n622\n00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.001\nSo they add that together.\n\n623\n00:35:10.001 --> 00:35:14.070\nSo you take 60,000, you divide\nit by 10 and so your IP address.\n\n624\n00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.460\nYou can have about 6,000 devices\nthat connect behind that.\n\n625\n00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:22.110\nNow when you do that, that doesn't\nnecessarily guarantee you the best\n\n626\n00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:25.070\nbandwidth connection per user though,\nokay.\n\n627\n00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:27.850\nImagine 6,000 people at one time\n\n628\n00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:31.540\nconnecting in through your\nInternet connection and\n\n629\n00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.050\nall of a sudden you go, well it's okay,\nI have a 10 megabit connection.\n\n630\n00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:38.190\nWell, you divide 6,000,\ninto that 10 megabit.\n\n631\n00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.610\nYou're gonna find that that's not\na lot of bandwidth per user there.\n\n632\n00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:45.430\nSo you might find out that even though\nthis number is probably fairly safe for\n\n633\n00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:47.070\npeople to have an okay connection.\n\n634\n00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.640\nYou want them to have a better connection,\nyou might go, I might need to get a second\n\n635\n00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:56.680\npublic IP address and divide that pool of\nnumber up, depending on what you have.\n\n636\n00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:02.160\nBut yes, you need to know at least\nthis basic mathematical equation here.\n\n637\n00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:09.300\nWhen Microsoft kind of gives\nyou an unusual scenario,\n\n638\n00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.550\nthe very fact is users\nare now complaining.\n\n639\n00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.080\nAt the beginning it was fine,\nconnecting to Office 365.\n\n640\n00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.980\nBut now, not so fine.\n\n641\n00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.190\nEverybody's actually\ndropping connections or\n\n642\n00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.140\nthey say that some people are able\nto connect and some people aren't.\n\n643\n00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.330\nWhat one of the options might be here,\nand how do you know that?\n\n644\n00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:29.080\nWell, being able to work through\nthis basic mathematical process\n\n645\n00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.350\nmight let you know,\nyes it's an issue with that,\n\n646\n00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.960\nit's an issue with not enough public IP\naddresses that will get you connected in.\n\n647\n00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.870\nSo we're not talking about trying to\ndivide up each particular megabit\n\n648\n00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:43.520\nconnection, but we're really talking\nabout some very practical stuff here.\n\n649\n00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.930\nEven with NAP because that's what most of\nus will actually be buying that we have\n\n650\n00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:50.390\nsome issues that we have to deal with,\nespecially when connecting to Office 365.\n\n651\n00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:53.420\n>> So make sure you tattoo this\nformula on your forearm, so\n\n652\n00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.970\nwhen you go into the exam\nthey kick you right out.\n\n653\n00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.620\n[LAUGH] No, that's not, but\nyou do want to memorize it.\n\n654\n00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.960\nYou do want to have it at least some\nlevel of mastery with it that you know\n\n655\n00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.460\nthe concept behind it and what they're\ntrying to convey, so that when you go\n\n656\n00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.220\ninto the testing booth, you're not gonna\ngo what does all this math business.\n\n657\n00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.030\nRonnie has done a great job of\nshowing you exactly what they're\n\n658\n00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.780\ngonna expect from you.\n\n659\n00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.160\nRonnie is there anything else\nwe need to cover before we go?\n\n660\n00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.050\n>> Not really, right?\n\n661\n00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:21.180\nThe very fact is there some other\nconnectivity issues that have to do with\n\n662\n00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.120\nother things like active directory and\nrights management, and\n\n663\n00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.100\nsome different stuff.\n\n664\n00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.950\nBut it's not actually just\nbasic connectivity here.\n\n665\n00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:30.380\nIt's about the entire organization\ngetting connected and\n\n666\n00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.150\nproviding the services that we need.\n\n667\n00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.090\nBut here's a good start for us, and\n\n668\n00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.050\nsome of the things we may have\nto end up troubleshooting.\n\n669\n00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.100\nSo just be aware.\n\n670\n00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:37.620\n>> Awesome.\n\n671\n00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.830\nThank you so much for explaining this\nto us and walking through this with us,\n\n672\n00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.290\nthat we might be better prepared for\nit on the exam.\n\n673\n00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.390\nAnd thank you for watching.\n\n674\n00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.390\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n675\n00:37:47.390

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.850\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we're continuing on with\n\n5\n00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.130\nour managing Office 365 identities and\nrequirements.\n\n6\n00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.070\nJoining me in the studio today,\nyou know him, you love him,\n\n7\n00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.190\nhe's our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.180\nRonnie, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.030\nHow are you doing today, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.350\n>> I am doing fine and great to be back\nas we continue to take a look at, well,\n\n11\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.700\nreally about the idea\nof managing Office 365.\n\n12\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.260\nAnd today we're heading into\nthat unusual realm of security\n\n13\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.150\nwhen we start dealing with cloud services.\n\n14\n00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.810\nNow I say unusual and\n\n15\n00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.300\nthe reason why is that security at one\npoint in my IT career was relatively easy.\n\n16\n00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.790\nDon't get me wrong, it got harder and\nharder and harder quickly, but\n\n17\n00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.500\nthe very fact is,\nat one point it was simple, right?\n\n18\n00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.590\nThe easiest way to do security in the past\nwas all of my narrow teshi inside of my\n\n19\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.990\nbuilding, and as long as I secure the\nbuilding and keep all of my perfect old\n\n20\n00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.260\ninfrastructure in place, keep my\npermissions in place, make sure my users\n\n21\n00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.170\nhave the right permissions,\nthen I was off and ready to go.\n\n22\n00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.760\nNow when we start thinking about that,\nthat sounds like a great idea.\n\n23\n00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.400\nWhy don't we do that anymore?\n\n24\n00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.237\nAnd that's because the world is changing,\nand the world has changed that no longer\n\n25\n00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:29.785\nis our data really just\nsecured in the building.\n\n26\n00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:34.095\nYou kinda remember those days where\nit was kind of like an this is great.\n\n27\n00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:36.465\nSomebody needs to actually\naccess a secured server?\n\n28\n00:01:36.465 --> 00:01:37.185\nWell, what do you do?\n\n29\n00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:39.065\nYou make them come in on the weekend and\n\n30\n00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:42.342\nyou make them use the actual computer\nfrom inside of the building.\n\n31\n00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:46.242\nYou don't give them things like\nVPN access or remote access in.\n\n32\n00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:49.962\nYou don't allow them to check things\nlike their email from their phone or\n\n33\n00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:55.432\nto send documents from a remote\ndevice into the network in that way.\n\n34\n00:01:55.432 --> 00:02:00.229\nSo today's networks have changed to the\npoint where what you hear today is what we\n\n35\n00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.544\ncall a boundaryless network,\nor a boundless network,\n\n36\n00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:08.960\nin which the walls of our network are no\nlonger really sufficient for protection.\n\n37\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.150\nAnd so when we start thinking about this,\nit used to be easier because all of our\n\n38\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.220\nservices were essentially on premise, so\nwe could secure it in an on-premise way.\n\n39\n00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.860\nBut now that you're making that\nchoice to move to Office 365, well,\n\n40\n00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.620\nnow you've got multiple places that\nyou have to worry about the security.\n\n41\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.020\nYou still have to worry about\nthe security that's on premise.\n\n42\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.610\nYou still have to take care\nof those things that you\n\n43\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.010\nnormally would take care of.\n\n44\n00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.670\nBut now that you've also implemented and\nstarted to use Office 365,\n\n45\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.770\nyour data is now split between\nwhere it might have began,\n\n46\n00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.820\nhere it is I'm working on my workstation.\n\n47\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.140\nBut when I go and store it and save it,\nwell, now I'm actually saving it\n\n48\n00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.860\ninside of my Office 365,\nmy OneDrive storage device out there.\n\n49\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.900\nSo Daniel,\nhow many people do you know that work for\n\n50\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.940\nlet's say OneDrive over at Microsoft?\n\n51\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.730\n>> I know, let me see, carry the three,\nyeah, zero people that work for OneDrive.\n\n52\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.700\n>> So if I were to say that would you\ntrust the security there, you would\n\n53\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.200\nobviously say absolutely, because I know\nsix or seven people that work there.\n\n54\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.510\nMost of us, I'm not gonna say\neverybody that's watching, but\n\n55\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.350\nmost of us probably say, no, I really\ndon't know anybody over at OneDrive.\n\n56\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.610\nAnd I'm not just picking on OneDrive.\n\n57\n00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.100\nAny of those cloud storage providers\nthat have their data stored up there\n\n58\n00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.830\nin the cloud solution, I'm not saying that\nthey're not completely trustworthy, but\n\n59\n00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.230\nyou and I might not be able to name\na single person that works there, but\n\n60\n00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.900\nyet I am now willing to\ntrust my own personal data\n\n61\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.680\nto being stored out there because\nI see the benefits of it.\n\n62\n00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.256\nBut what about real security on things\nthat really matter such as your business,\n\n63\n00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:47.949\nstuff that you actually\nhave to keep private and\n\n64\n00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:52.622\nsecure due to compliance issues, due to\nauditing issues, whatever it might be?\n\n65\n00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:57.747\nYou have to actually be able to keep the\nsecurity going the way that we need to.\n\n66\n00:03:57.747 --> 00:04:02.499\nAnd so now all the sudden you realize that\nthe security measures that Daniel and\n\n67\n00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:07.251\nI learned about when we first got started,\nthey apply to a point, but how do you\n\n68\n00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:12.030\nactually take those measures and\napply them to something like Office 365?\n\n69\n00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.704\nAnd that's what we're really focusing in\non right here today as we start thinking\n\n70\n00:04:16.704 --> 00:04:17.322\nabout it.\n\n71\n00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:22.298\nSo we do have to actually worry that there\nis a chance that my data could get lost\n\n72\n00:04:22.298 --> 00:04:26.305\nout there, could be compromised\nby somebody else out there.\n\n73\n00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:28.340\nI just don't know it.\n\n74\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.520\nSo the good thing is in Office 365,\n\n75\n00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.230\nthere's a whole system out there\nthat they call rights management.\n\n76\n00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.040\nSo when we deal with the idea\nof rights management,\n\n77\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.050\nrights management is actually a layer\nof security that we can implement,\n\n78\n00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.195\nusing Office 365,\nto help us to protect the data itself.\n\n79\n00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:51.140\nAnd this is true,\n\n80\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.476\nwhen we use it with Office 365, whether\nthe data actually resides right here,\n\n81\n00:04:57.476 --> 00:05:03.680\nwhether it's actually in transmitting\nfrom here up to Microsoft Office 365, or\n\n82\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.100\nwhether I say Daniel, I'm gonna share this\nfile with you through OneDrive somewhere,\n\n83\n00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.060\nand whether he actually\ndownloads it to his computer.\n\n84\n00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.140\nWe can actually manage those things\nthrough what we call rights management.\n\n85\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.840\nNow this term is changed over the years,\nand\n\n86\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.270\nI want to point that out, because\nthose of you that are preparing for\n\n87\n00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.910\nthe exam,\nthey have a test pool of exam questions.\n\n88\n00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.890\nAnd even though the terminology\nhas changed over time for\n\n89\n00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.850\nthis exam,\nyou might still find older terminology.\n\n90\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.730\nSo at one point you might've heard it\ncalled Windows Azure Active Directory\n\n91\n00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.690\nservice or something like that.\n\n92\n00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.560\nToday they just call it\nAzure Active Directory and\n\n93\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.170\nAzure Rights Management,\nWindows Azure Rights Management.\n\n94\n00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.970\nWhen you hear all that,\nit means the same thing.\n\n95\n00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.008\nYou may even see the term thrown\nin there that'll talk about\n\n96\n00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:55.225\nMicrosoft Azure Active Directory, and so\nthose two terms are kind of the new one.\n\n97\n00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:58.897\nThe one that's Azure Rights Management,\nMicrosoft Azure Rights Management,\n\n98\n00:05:58.897 --> 00:06:00.787\nthose are kinda the most recent ones, but\n\n99\n00:06:00.787 --> 00:06:04.980\nI can't guarantee you on the exam that\nyou're gonna see those terms specifically.\n\n100\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.364\nSo just realize that if\nyou do see others terms,\n\n101\n00:06:07.364 --> 00:06:09.509\nthe key terms that you\nwant to focus in on and\n\n102\n00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.690\nwhat we're really covering here today is\ngonna be that idea of rights management.\n\n103\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.896\n>> Ronnie, really quickly,\nwhen I think of rights management,\n\n104\n00:06:16.896 --> 00:06:18.976\nand I wanna make sure I'm correct and\nI'm following you and\n\n105\n00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:21.570\nI wanna make sure everybody out\nthere is following you as well.\n\n106\n00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.050\nWhen I think of rights management I'm\nthinking, okay, I've got users and\n\n107\n00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.050\nI'm giving them access to\nsomething in the vein of if we had\n\n108\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.970\nthe permissions on like a file or\na folder.\n\n109\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.381\nIs that what we're talking about here,\nsame kind of idea but\n\n110\n00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:36.385\njust in a different way?\n\n111\n00:06:36.385 --> 00:06:39.769\n>> Yeah, to a point,\nit is about making sure that only\n\n112\n00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:44.257\nthe people that you give permissions\nto are able to see the data, but\n\n113\n00:06:44.257 --> 00:06:48.460\nat the same time it actually\ngoes beyond that idea.\n\n114\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.302\nSo that as long as it goes through\nOffice 6, Office 65 [LAUGH].\n\n115\n00:06:53.302 --> 00:06:54.908\nI left off a 3 somewhere.\n\n116\n00:06:54.908 --> 00:06:57.203\n>> Ronnie's got his own\nproduct out there [LAUGH].\n\n117\n00:06:57.203 --> 00:07:01.757\n>> Office 365, as long as essentially we\ngo through Office 365 with the rights\n\n118\n00:07:01.757 --> 00:07:03.605\nmanagement services turned on,\n\n119\n00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:07.103\nit's really backed up by the entire\nAzure Rights Management,\n\n120\n00:07:07.103 --> 00:07:12.370\nwhich is a complete different product, but\nOffice 365 builds on top of that thing.\n\n121\n00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.620\nAs long as it goes through there,\nwe have the ability to control the data,\n\n122\n00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.570\nregardless of where\nthe object is on this planet.\n\n123\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.070\nSo even if Daniel decided he was going\nto take a vacation on the other side of\n\n124\n00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.006\nthe planet, and he said oh,\nI need to get access to that file,\n\n125\n00:07:26.006 --> 00:07:29.694\neven if he downloaded it onto his phone,\nwell, it would still be protected.\n\n126\n00:07:29.694 --> 00:07:34.810\nSo it actually does go a bit beyond\nthe idea of just simple permissions,\n\n127\n00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.460\nand we need that.\n\n128\n00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.440\nThe reason why we need it is because\nno longer are the devices in which we\n\n129\n00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.410\nview our own company's data\njust owned by the company.\n\n130\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.840\nIn other words, they're not actually\njust the ones that do that.\n\n131\n00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.484\nI actually have my own phone which\nI check my business email on.\n\n132\n00:07:49.484 --> 00:07:53.377\nNot only that though, even things\nthat I might download files to,\n\n133\n00:07:53.377 --> 00:07:56.576\nthey're not necessarily\nthe company's machines but\n\n134\n00:07:56.576 --> 00:08:00.556\nI do download my company files onto\nmy own personal machine as well.\n\n135\n00:08:00.556 --> 00:08:03.822\nSo we need the ability to have\nprotection in that way and\n\n136\n00:08:03.822 --> 00:08:08.516\nthis is regardless of whether or\nnot we're connected to Office 365 or not.\n\n137\n00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:12.045\nAzure Rights Management absolutely\ntries to protect the data.\n\n138\n00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:16.202\nNow not only do we actually focus\nin on just Office 365 data, but\n\n139\n00:08:16.202 --> 00:08:21.253\nremember that because Office 365 is\na productivity suite that really extends\n\n140\n00:08:21.253 --> 00:08:26.630\ninto things like the storage that we were\ntalking about, and even in the email.\n\n141\n00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.270\nIt also extends all the way out there.\n\n142\n00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:34.238\nAs long as you actually start off with\nOffice 365 Rights Management turned on,\n\n143\n00:08:34.238 --> 00:08:38.207\nyou then can extend that integration\ninto your exchange server.\n\n144\n00:08:38.207 --> 00:08:41.221\nYou can extend it into\nyour SharePoint sites, and\n\n145\n00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:43.316\nall of that stuff can be turned on.\n\n146\n00:08:43.316 --> 00:08:46.667\nBut the basics is what we're\ntalking about right here,\n\n147\n00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:51.515\nwhere we actually show you where do we get\nstarted and how do we begin to administer\n\n148\n00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:56.100\nthe Office 365 management services\nis where we're actually starting.\n\n149\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.340\nSo it's a great thing for us to at least\nhave an understanding of, and it may come\n\n150\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.850\na point where you do, you actually have\nto work this out with your organization.\n\n151\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.635\nHow is this gonna fit into your policy,\nand where does all of this stuff turn on?\n\n152\n00:09:11.635 --> 00:09:15.450\nAnd how do we actually get\nthe integration of our security policy\n\n153\n00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.540\nwith our on premise versus the way that we\nalso do it with Azure Rights Management.\n\n154\n00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.770\nSo there's a lot more to go\nthat's more technically detailed.\n\n155\n00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.264\nBut what we're actually doing here,\nis we're gonna show you how to turn it on,\n\n156\n00:09:26.264 --> 00:09:29.759\nand we also need to get into some of the\nfeatures that you can't actually just use\n\n157\n00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:31.300\nthe management portal to turn on.\n\n158\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.680\nSome of them you can, but we're also\ngonna go a little bit of PowerShell,\n\n159\n00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.790\nto show you also how to\nmanage it there as well.\n\n160\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.262\nSo there's a lot of different things and\nPowerShell, of course,\n\n161\n00:09:40.262 --> 00:09:42.500\nis Gates says it's the wave of the future.\n\n162\n00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.640\nThe very fact is, you're not gonna\nbe able to get around Microsoft\n\n163\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.840\nservices at all without at least knowing\na little bit of PowerShell to do so.\n\n164\n00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.350\nAs you get into exchange online and\n\n165\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.860\neven the SharePoint stuff it's gonna\nbecome more and more dependent on that,\n\n166\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.280\nbut we'll show you at least the basics\nhere today as we get started.\n\n167\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.900\nSo lets go ahead and jump in and\n\n168\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.660\nshow you at least the beginnings\nwhen we start to do this here, okay?\n\n169\n00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.730\nSo when we start doing this on my machine\nhere I'm running a Windows 10 machine,\n\n170\n00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.230\nand there's a couple of different\nthings that we're gonna have to do.\n\n171\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.670\nThe first thing is as we get started\n\n172\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.200\nthere's gonna be two different\ncomponents to this, right?\n\n173\n00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.720\nOne is turning it on in the portal side,\nand\n\n174\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.480\nthen secondly is how you\nchoose to manage it.\n\n175\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.860\nSo what we're also going to do is we're\ngonna show you from the on premise\n\n176\n00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.920\nsite as well, using some of the PowerShell\nstuff to get it ready and going.\n\n177\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.652\nAnd so I'll show you the process and\n\n178\n00:10:34.652 --> 00:10:37.930\nthe steps that I use to make\nsure that we turn this thing on.\n\n179\n00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.360\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do\nis connect up to my Office 365.\n\n180\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.680\nAnd let me see if I can\nmake that connection now.\n\n181\n00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:53.440\nI'll use this browser right here,\nportal@office.com, and in\n\n182\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.710\na moment I should get to my login portal\nif everything is actually connected there.\n\n183\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.731\nOh, it's actually still\nusing that proxy server.\n\n184\n00:11:00.731 --> 00:11:03.204\nSo that's probably why I'm\nactually having a problem there.\n\n185\n00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:09.210\nLet me see if I can change\nthat up here for a moment.\n\n186\n00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.380\n>> Be a quick fix.\n\n187\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.990\n>> Should be a quick fix if I can\nactually find exactly where I need to go,\n\n188\n00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.870\nthat's usually the key here.\n\n189\n00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.940\nNetwork and internet,\nnetwork and internet options.\n\n190\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.360\nAnd then connections, so I was using\na proxy server a little bit earlier and I\n\n191\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.480\njust need to turn that off right now, cuz\nwe'll no longer need to demonstrate that.\n\n192\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.020\nSo hopefully that will kick right in and\ndon't need to go through that.\n\n193\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.343\nAnd then we'll try it again, portal.\n\n194\n00:11:34.343 --> 00:11:36.529\nYep that's actually better.\n\n195\n00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:39.949\nOffice.com and\nin a moment I'm gonna log right in and\n\n196\n00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:44.134\nwe're gonna get into of course\nthe Office 365 admin console.\n\n197\n00:11:44.134 --> 00:11:47.346\nAll right so\nwe're simply gonna log into Office 365.\n\n198\n00:11:47.346 --> 00:11:52.870\nLet me click on my log in and\nhopefully I copied my password correctly.\n\n199\n00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.700\nAnd let me sign on in and that looks\npretty descent for right now, there we go.\n\n200\n00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.200\nOkay, so now that we're logged in,\n\n201\n00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.100\nthis is really one of those buried\noptions that's actually in here.\n\n202\n00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.980\nSo it's not as intuitive as a lot of\nthe other things that we've done.\n\n203\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.360\nSo go ahead and click on that little\nbutton in the upper left hand corner.\n\n204\n00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.548\nI'm sure there's a name for that little\nbutton, but I don't know what it is.\n\n205\n00:12:13.548 --> 00:12:15.582\nIt looks like a little\ncheckerboard button to me but\n\n206\n00:12:15.582 --> 00:12:17.062\nthat's not exactly what it is here.\n\n207\n00:12:17.062 --> 00:12:21.457\nSo over here on the left hand side in\nthe actual administrative center console.\n\n208\n00:12:21.457 --> 00:12:25.198\nAs you scroll on through you would\nthink that rights management,\n\n209\n00:12:25.198 --> 00:12:29.551\none of the important things that really\nhelps you to protect everything that\n\n210\n00:12:29.551 --> 00:12:34.057\nyou're gonna do working through Office\n365, is gonna be very prominent.\n\n211\n00:12:34.057 --> 00:12:39.580\nAnd you would absolutely be 100%\nmistaken here, when we do turn this on.\n\n212\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.670\nSo if I scroll down, what I'm looking for\nis where it says service settings.\n\n213\n00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:50.065\nAnd if I click on service settings here,\nthen underneath service settings,\n\n214\n00:12:50.065 --> 00:12:53.974\nI'm going to click on where\nit says rights management.\n\n215\n00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:58.139\nAnd even when you think that rights\nmanagement day this is all we have to do\n\n216\n00:12:58.139 --> 00:13:02.644\nis we simply click a check box here, well\nnotice once again, it really is one of\n\n217\n00:13:02.644 --> 00:13:06.700\nthose things where they decided\nto hide it a little bit deeper.\n\n218\n00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.490\nSo you have to learn about more or\nmanage, and I'm gonna click Manage.\n\n219\n00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.880\nAnd so, once we actually select the\nmanagement it's going to lead us out to\n\n220\n00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.500\nAzure's rights management\npage which is right here.\n\n221\n00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.450\nSo, you can actually see in the address\nbar now you can't really see very well,\n\n222\n00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:31.120\nbut it actually says\naccount.activedirectory.windowsazure.com.\n\n223\n00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.860\nSo in the background, remember that app,\nthat Office 365, right?\n\n224\n00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.600\nIt is integrated into this\nAzure Active Directory, okay?\n\n225\n00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.170\nAnd part of Azure Active Directory is\nthis idea of doing the rights management.\n\n226\n00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.650\nAnd it's right here in\nthe rights management that\n\n227\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.270\ngives us this ability to do\nwhat we were talking about.\n\n228\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:54.088\nSo rights management safeguards emails and\ndocuments, helps you securely\n\n229\n00:13:54.088 --> 00:13:59.143\nshare the data with your colleagues, and\nall we have to do first is activate it.\n\n230\n00:13:59.143 --> 00:14:01.943\nAnd it asks us do we\nreally want to do this?\n\n231\n00:14:01.943 --> 00:14:05.749\nWhen you activate the RMS your\norganization can start to protect\n\n232\n00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:10.273\nimportant documents and emails using\nthe Azure Rights Management server.\n\n233\n00:14:10.273 --> 00:14:15.074\nService disinformation protection\nintegrates with applications, Exchange,\n\n234\n00:14:15.074 --> 00:14:18.620\nand SharePoint, and\nservers such as Microsoft Exchange and\n\n235\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.130\nMicrosoft SharePoint as well.\n\n236\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.320\nAnd so, we can click Activate.\n\n237\n00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.430\nNow, once we do that,\nthat really is kind of the major part\n\n238\n00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.870\non the portal side that we\nrarely worry about, okay?\n\n239\n00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:37.010\nSo now the rights management is\nnow currently activated for us.\n\n240\n00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.920\nAnd, this means that we're\nready to set it up on\n\n241\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.900\nour side where we're gonna\nreally be managing this from.\n\n242\n00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.610\nSo, after this, there's not a lot of\nconfiguration that you really have to do\n\n243\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.140\ninside of the portal.\n\n244\n00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.500\nSo on that point you go okay,\n\n245\n00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.010\nwell everything's done\nwhat else do I need to do?\n\n246\n00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.940\nThere's a couple of other things\nthat we need to do to make sure\n\n247\n00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.160\nthat we can communicate with it and\n\n248\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.655\nalso do the kind of management\nstuff that we always have to do.\n\n249\n00:15:01.655 --> 00:15:03.890\n>> So\nactivation is just really the first step.\n\n250\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.943\nYou think okay I've gotta activate it,\nhit the activate button.\n\n251\n00:15:06.943 --> 00:15:10.603\nNow that Rights Management system is\nturned on, I'm ready to rock, and\n\n252\n00:15:10.603 --> 00:15:11.265\n[SOUND] yeah.\n\n253\n00:15:11.265 --> 00:15:12.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're kind of ready to rock.\n\n254\n00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.460\nAnd I love how they kind of told you that\nyou're now ready to do this, this, this,\n\n255\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.840\nand this, but\ndon't forget you have to take\n\n256\n00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.570\na couple other steps to make sure\nthis stuff will actually work.\n\n257\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.360\nRonnie, where do we go now that\nwe've got activation working?\n\n258\n00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.040\nWhat is the next thing that we need to to?\n\n259\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.930\n>> Yeah, the next thing that we're\ngonna do is the thing that kinda\n\n260\n00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.470\nscares me the most, and maybe not you.\n\n261\n00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.400\nIf you're a great typer,\nyou're probably this is good and\n\n262\n00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.520\nDaniel's already laughing about it, but if\nyou're like me and typing is a challenge.\n\n263\n00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.630\nDon't get me wrong, I know how to type,\nbut I'm a poor typer.\n\n264\n00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.109\n>> I laugh because Ronnie\nknows the commands,\n\n265\n00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:47.736\nit literally is his typing that challenges\nhim so that's why it gets kinda funny.\n\n266\n00:15:47.736 --> 00:15:50.193\nIt's not that he doesn't know\nwhat he's supposed to put in,\n\n267\n00:15:50.193 --> 00:15:52.049\nhe just can't make\nthe digits make it happen.\n\n268\n00:15:52.049 --> 00:15:54.385\n[LAUGH] Without at least trying three or\nfour times.\n\n269\n00:15:54.385 --> 00:15:56.742\n>> I know, whatever it might be, or.\n\n270\n00:15:56.742 --> 00:15:59.484\nSo there's a couple things that we\nneed to do to make this happen.\n\n271\n00:15:59.484 --> 00:16:00.602\n>> We need PowerShell.\n\n272\n00:16:00.602 --> 00:16:01.452\nNow, you might go,\n\n273\n00:16:01.452 --> 00:16:04.930\nwell, I'm running Windows 10,\nthere's a PowerShell right there.\n\n274\n00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:09.860\nBut what we need to do is we need to add\nin, of course, the active directory or\n\n275\n00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.660\nthe, I should just say active directory,\n\n276\n00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.890\nthe Azure active directory component\nthat makes it work in PowerShell.\n\n277\n00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.170\nSo, there are a couple of things that\nneed to go on here when you do this.\n\n278\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.860\nNow, when you start taking a look,\nright, so there's two components.\n\n279\n00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.212\nLet me show you these two components here,\nokay?\n\n280\n00:16:26.212 --> 00:16:31.330\nOne of these is just so that you can\nmake the connection to Office 365 and\n\n281\n00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.930\ndownload the important\ncomponents that you need to.\n\n282\n00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:38.669\nSo, it allows, It makes the machine be\nable to connect when we import modules in\n\n283\n00:16:38.669 --> 00:16:41.300\nfor the PowerShell stuff\nthat we need to do.\n\n284\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.620\nAnd so, this is something that\nyou'll actually end up having to do.\n\n285\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.120\nNow, it depends on your machine and\nupdates and different things that go on.\n\n286\n00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.390\nBut how do you know that\nyou need both components?\n\n287\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:56.100\nWell, the other one, of course,\nis that Azure Active Directory for\n\n288\n00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.140\nWindows PowerShell.\n\n289\n00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.980\nSo, it's actually the Azure Active\nDirectory module for Windows PowerShell.\n\n290\n00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.220\nAnd this is only available in 64-bit.\n\n291\n00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.020\nAnd that's usually not a problem for\nmost of us.\n\n292\n00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.880\nBut if you're actually running\nthe latest editions of PowerShell,\n\n293\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.370\nyou're gonna need\nthe 64-bit version of it.\n\n294\n00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:19.380\nAs you double click on that thing,\nif you click next right here and\n\n295\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.470\nit tells you that you're\nmissing a component, and\n\n296\n00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.030\nit's gonna give you the full name\nof what you need to go out and\n\n297\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.540\ndownload to make this work,\njust highlight and copy that.\n\n298\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.930\nIt's a long kind of weird\nname that it gives you.\n\n299\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:33.950\nSo, I didn't even write it out.\n\n300\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:38.580\nBut just, if it gives you another little\nmessage thing that says you're missing\n\n301\n00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.358\nthis component, download whatever\nversion 2.0 or later of it.\n\n302\n00:17:41.358 --> 00:17:43.350\nI did this exact same thing.\n\n303\n00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.240\nI copied it.\n\n304\n00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.710\nI pasted it in my browser, and\nit brought me to the download page.\n\n305\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.440\nYou download and you install that first.\n\n306\n00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.250\nAnd I just went ahead and\ndownloaded it right here so\n\n307\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.110\nthat I could have it on board,\nthat way we could see it.\n\n308\n00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.160\nYou need to run that first.\n\n309\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.650\nIt may ask you to reboot the computer.\n\n310\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.300\nOkay?\nIf it does, you'll reboot.\n\n311\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.760\nAnd then, you can go back and\nrun this installation.\n\n312\n00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.641\nSo, it's a couple of step process.\n\n313\n00:18:07.641 --> 00:18:11.440\nNow, I do need to warn you about something\nI found out a little bit earlier when\n\n314\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.450\ndoing this.\n\n315\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:19.224\nThere is a Windows Azure Rights\nmanagement thing.\n\n316\n00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:20.182\nOkay?\n\n317\n00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:25.778\nAnd the name is almost the same as the one\nthat's the rights management module for\n\n318\n00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:27.170\nPowerShell.\n\n319\n00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.201\nSo, it's actually named the whole thing,\nthe same thing, right?\n\n320\n00:18:29.201 --> 00:18:33.249\nAzure Rights Management for\nWindows Administration,\n\n321\n00:18:33.249 --> 00:18:35.319\nI think is what it's called.\n\n322\n00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:41.880\nAnd then, there's the Azure Rights\nManagement Module for PowerShell.\n\n323\n00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.580\nYou gotta get the right one.\n\n324\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.590\nYou gotta get the one for PowerShell.\n\n325\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:51.210\nIf not, it will cause you just\na tad bit of consternation\n\n326\n00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.590\nwhen you try and run some of the commands\nthat we're gonna be talking about.\n\n327\n00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.670\nAnd I only tell you this from experience.\n\n328\n00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.320\nI really only tell you\nthis from experience.\n\n329\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.780\nIf it wasn't for that, and\n\n330\n00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.280\nme banging my head like, I downloaded\nwhat I thought it needed to download.\n\n331\n00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.180\nAnd then, I realized that\nthe names were almost identical.\n\n332\n00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.060\nAnd that's just somebody's\nnaming convention,\n\n333\n00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.850\nthat they just didn't see that\nthey were two different things.\n\n334\n00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:15.870\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n335\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.240\nit seemed to work until all of the sudden\nyou couldn't type in certain commands.\n\n336\n00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.050\nAnd then, when they said, well,\n\n337\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.240\ncheck these things out and\nthe modules don't even appear.\n\n338\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.080\nSo, I just give you a little\nbit of a caveat, a warning.\n\n339\n00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.360\nSo, make sure whatever you choose,\n\n340\n00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.260\nit's the one that says the module for\nPowerShell.\n\n341\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.570\nThat is the key,\nthe word module or power shell.\n\n342\n00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.630\nNot just the Azure Rights Management for\nWindows.\n\n343\n00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.980\nNot the right one.\n\n344\n00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.590\n>> And if you start typing into Powershell\nthe command you think should be working,\n\n345\n00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.210\nand you get nothing, or you get an error-\n>> Yeah.\n\n346\n00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.804\n>> You probably got the wrong guy.\n\n347\n00:19:46.804 --> 00:19:48.850\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, that's a telltale sign\n\n348\n00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.415\nI've downloaded and\ninstalled the wrong thing.\n\n349\n00:19:50.415 --> 00:19:51.780\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, let me go back and\n\n350\n00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.131\nget the right thing, and the right\nthing should work fine after that.\n\n351\n00:19:54.131 --> 00:19:55.900\n>> Yeah.\nAnd especially in the Powershell when you\n\n352\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.360\nget object is not found, and\nit's supposed to be there.\n\n353\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.390\nWell, then, it's telling you that it\ndidn't install the right components.\n\n354\n00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.250\nSo, you do need to be careful with that.\n\n355\n00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.602\nAnd I just wanted to make sure\nwe pointed that one out, too.\n\n356\n00:20:06.602 --> 00:20:07.240\nAll right.\n\n357\n00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.180\nSo, here it is.\n\n358\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.460\nAzure active directory module for\nPowerShell.\n\n359\n00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.280\nAnd remember that that's the key.\n\n360\n00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.570\nAnd we're simply gonna accept this.\n\n361\n00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.320\nNow, of course, Daniel,\n\n362\n00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.340\nyou would read every single word of\nthat end user licensing agreement.\n\n363\n00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.100\n>> Every letter on that [CROSSTALK] page,\nI've read it.\n\n364\n00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.432\n>> Every single letter.\n\n365\n00:20:20.432 --> 00:20:24.001\nAnd then we're gonna click Next.\n\n366\n00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:25.125\nAnd then, install.\n\n367\n00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:27.168\nAnd let it actually install here, too.\n\n368\n00:20:27.168 --> 00:20:30.010\nOkay?\nNow, here is how you know the difference\n\n369\n00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.070\nvery easily.\n\n370\n00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.870\nAnd then,\nI'm just gonna point this out to you.\n\n371\n00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.110\nI don't think this would be on the exam.\n\n372\n00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:40.430\nBut as long as the icon looks like\na PowerShell icon, okay, you're fine.\n\n373\n00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.980\nIf it looks like the little icon\nthat looks kinda neat, but you go,\n\n374\n00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.854\nI've never seen that Windows icon before,\nthat's the wrong one.\n\n375\n00:20:46.854 --> 00:20:49.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Okay?\n\n376\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.260\nSo, yes, again,\n\n377\n00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:55.210\nthis will save you hours of frustration\nif you'll take my advice here.\n\n378\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.650\nBut that is the one that\nwe are looking for.\n\n379\n00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.380\nSo, this will add on, essentially,\nextending the powers and\n\n380\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.240\nthe capabilities of PowerShell on your\ncomputer, is what we're gonna do.\n\n381\n00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.786\nSo, now that we have it activated\non the portal side, right?\n\n382\n00:21:09.786 --> 00:21:16.910\nIn other words, our Office 365 account\nis now ready for rights management.\n\n383\n00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:22.040\nFor us to manage it, we simply use\nthat Azure Active Directory module.\n\n384\n00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.660\nAnd I'm gonna change the font size here,\nbriefly.\n\n385\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.820\n>> It's a little microscopic.\n\n386\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.130\n>> It's just a tad bit\ntiny as the default there.\n\n387\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.800\nLet me change it up to 24 point here.\n\n388\n00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.630\nAnd then, make the color just brighter.\n\n389\n00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.210\nAnd, oh, it won't let me do that.\n\n390\n00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.650\nOh, there we go.\nI don't know what happened there.\n\n391\n00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:41.150\nBut that,\n\n392\n00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.480\nwe should be able to see, actually\nstill looks a little bit small there.\n\n393\n00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.385\n>> Still a little small.\n\n394\n00:21:45.385 --> 00:21:46.807\n[CROSSTALK] A little larger.\n\n395\n00:21:46.807 --> 00:21:51.030\n>> I thought 24 point would\nbe kind of what we needed.\n\n396\n00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:55.880\nBut, maybe, yeah,\nthere we go that will actually work.\n\n397\n00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.420\n>> That's better.\n\n398\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.370\n>> A little bit better for us here.\n\n399\n00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.450\nSo, once we get the Azure, and\n\n400\n00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.370\nyou wanna make sure it's actually here,\n>> There's also another thing you want\n\n401\n00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.580\nto do which is also something that will\nsave you a little bit of headache here.\n\n402\n00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.810\nIs you want to run it as\nthe administrator if you can.\n\n403\n00:22:11.395 --> 00:22:15.260\nCuz, remember that you are actually,\nand, of course I changed my font size.\n\n404\n00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.690\nI can't win here.\n\n405\n00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.100\nLet me quickly do 28 again.\n\n406\n00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.010\nChange that color back to here.\n\n407\n00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:23.920\nAnd that will make it even.\n\n408\n00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920\nThere we go.\n\n409\n00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.980\nSo, that way we can actually see it more.\n\n410\n00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.760\nBut run it as the administrator since\nyou're actually gonna be making\n\n411\n00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.340\nadministrative changes in between.\n\n412\n00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.520\nThis is what you want to be able to do.\n\n413\n00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.710\nSo, once we get to this point, okay,\n\n414\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.280\nwe want to make sure that everything\nis actually installed here.\n\n415\n00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.649\nNow, what we need to do is we need to\nconnect to the rights management service\n\n416\n00:22:43.649 --> 00:22:47.480\nfrom this console now, okay,\nis what our next thing is.\n\n417\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.690\nNow, we also need to\nimport in one more module.\n\n418\n00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.166\nSo, I'm gonna do an import module.\n\n419\n00:22:53.166 --> 00:22:56.555\nAnd it's here that we\nactually have to import in\n\n420\n00:22:56.555 --> 00:23:00.888\nthe Azure Active Directory\nRights Management module here.\n\n421\n00:23:00.888 --> 00:23:04.752\nSo, the way that they do\nthat is they abbreviate it.\n\n422\n00:23:04.752 --> 00:23:07.799\nAzure Active Directory Rights management.\n\n423\n00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:10.750\nAnd then, I can press enter, or return.\n\n424\n00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.090\nAnd there we go.\n\n425\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.650\nSo, everything's actually accepted and\ndone what we actually needed to.\n\n426\n00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.701\nNow, I need to make sure I also connect in\n\n427\n00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:23.900\nto the Azure Active Directory\nRights Management Service as well.\n\n428\n00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:29.010\nSo, Azure Active Directory Rights\nmanagement service.\n\n429\n00:23:30.088 --> 00:23:32.790\nAt least they actually named that one kind\nof something that I would understand here.\n\n430\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.440\nI want to do the verbost thing again.\n\n431\n00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.185\nAnd now, it's asking me to supply\nmy credentials one more time.\n\n432\n00:23:39.185 --> 00:23:45.150\nITproTVdemo.com.\n\n433\n00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.630\nAnd, hopefully,\nI can still paste my password.\n\n434\n00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.240\nThere we go.\n\n435\n00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.250\nClick OK.\nAnd so, right here\n\n436\n00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.370\neverything should actually come back and\nallow me to make the connection in.\n\n437\n00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:56.940\nAnd there we go.\n\n438\n00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.392\nWe get the actual verbage here.\n\n439\n00:23:59.392 --> 00:24:03.935\nA Connection to Windows Azure Active\nDirectory Rights Management service was\n\n440\n00:24:03.935 --> 00:24:04.492\nopened.\n\n441\n00:24:04.492 --> 00:24:09.480\nFor me, and so now I'm actually connected\ninto, well, not only the Microsoft\n\n442\n00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.170\nonline where I am, in other words my\nOffice 365 attendant account, but\n\n443\n00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:19.060\nI am also using Active Directory\nRights Management through that too.\n\n444\n00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.270\nNow, if we want to use\nActive Directory Rights Management,\n\n445\n00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.550\nso activating it where we did\ninside the portal, perfectly fine,\n\n446\n00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:28.150\nthat's what we definitely need to do at\nthe beginning, but to actually be able\n\n447\n00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.980\nto use the rights management,\nyou have to do it from here as well, and\n\n448\n00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.660\nthis is where you must enable, so\nwe're going to type in enable.\n\n449\n00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.400\n>> That's just Microsoft trying to\nconfuse us all over again, activate and\n\n450\n00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.210\nenable, in normal everyday speak,\nthat means the exact same thing.\n\n451\n00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.402\n>> Here, it's obviously two different\nsteps, so just make sure you\n\n452\n00:24:48.402 --> 00:24:51.822\nbury that little tidbit of information\nright in the front of the brain,\n\n453\n00:24:51.822 --> 00:24:55.197\nso when you go take an exam,\nyou're not tripped up by a question on it.\n\n454\n00:24:55.197 --> 00:24:58.085\n>> That is a great observation there,\nDaniel,\n\n455\n00:24:58.085 --> 00:25:03.405\nbecause without understanding that, it's\neasy for us to see questions that say,\n\n456\n00:25:03.405 --> 00:25:07.746\nwhich of the following will get\nrights management, ready to work.\n\n457\n00:25:07.746 --> 00:25:12.770\nWell activating is part of but\nalso enabling\n\n458\n00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:17.530\nit is the second part of the step as well.\n\n459\n00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.251\n>> You're an enabler, Ronnie.\n\n460\n00:25:18.251 --> 00:25:19.120\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know, and\n\n461\n00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.110\nthat's what we have to be\nhere is we have to do both.\n\n462\n00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.080\nSo just remember that\ndoing one is not enough,\n\n463\n00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.660\njust activating is not enough,\nbut also needing to enable it.\n\n464\n00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.220\nWithout that, you can activate it all day\nlong and try and type in commands and\n\n465\n00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.530\nmake everything else work,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n466\n00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.030\nHere is the command that does that, and\n\n467\n00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.380\nthen what you should see\nagain is another one.\n\n468\n00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.400\nThe rights management service has\nbeen successfully enabled through,\n\n469\n00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.010\nalthough additional configuration\nof other things might be required.\n\n470\n00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.420\nSo it's letting you know,\nhere's just kind of the basics.\n\n471\n00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.100\nNow all the other services that\nyou want to run through here,\n\n472\n00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:56.660\nif you're going to be integrating in\nExchange Online and the SharePoint stuff,\n\n473\n00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.850\nthere's still a ton of commands for\nyou to be able to go out and learn.\n\n474\n00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.976\nAnd that's what we're going to leave it\nto, [LAUGH] is you're going to go out and\n\n475\n00:26:04.976 --> 00:26:05.610\nlearn that stuff.\n\n476\n00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:09.340\nBecause it's so specific and there's a lot\nof little details that have to kind of\n\n477\n00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.720\nmatch in with the way that you run your\nexchange and then everything else.\n\n478\n00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.370\nBut you actually build a,\n\n479\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:19.030\nif you got to do a search you'll see\nthe integration patterns for those and\n\n480\n00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.120\nyou'll be able to do that right\nhere inside of this management to.\n\n481\n00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.560\nOnce we actually have that enabled,\n\n482\n00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.790\nI don't really need to connect\nto the service any longer.\n\n483\n00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.450\nIn other words,\nI don't need to leave this up and running.\n\n484\n00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.100\nI don't have to do anything else,\nbut what we want to do,\n\n485\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.990\nbecause if I leave this up and\nI actually have my credentials in there,\n\n486\n00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:42.492\nif I'm now on a regular desktop machine\nand I'm kind of not thinking about it,\n\n487\n00:26:42.492 --> 00:26:45.860\nI walk away from my machine,\nleave it logged on.\n\n488\n00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.640\nWell, remember that,\nthat means that they have access where,\n\n489\n00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.460\nto your Active Directory Rights\nManagement, as well as to Office 365,\n\n490\n00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.760\nin this management console,\nis not what we want to do.\n\n491\n00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.531\nSo, what we would do here is\nwe would disconnect from our\n\n492\n00:27:02.531 --> 00:27:08.280\naadrmservice is what we\nwould actually do here,\n\n493\n00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.860\nand then just verbose it, so\nthat if we actually have anything and\n\n494\n00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.210\nmake sure that our connection to\nthat service is closed as well.\n\n495\n00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.930\nSo that allows me to make sure that I've\ndropped that connection, but what, I've\n\n496\n00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:23.870\nleft it enabled which is the thing that\nwe want and this actually makes it easy.\n\n497\n00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.080\nIf one day you go,\nI don't want to use this anymore.\n\n498\n00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.020\nYou just simply go back in, connect to it,\nand then you can do the disable, and\n\n499\n00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.810\nthen you're ready to go as well.\n\n500\n00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.240\nSo, being able to disconnect from this,\nis that final step.\n\n501\n00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.250\nSo remember that,\nwe didn't show you a ton, but\n\n502\n00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.574\nwe showed you enough,\njust to get the rights management enabled.\n\n503\n00:27:40.574 --> 00:27:42.070\nWe showed you where to activate it.\n\n504\n00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.740\nWe also showed you the ability here to\nmake sure you get that right module for\n\n505\n00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.870\nWindows PowerShell, and\nthen of course be able to enable it, and\n\n506\n00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:50.880\nthen you are ready to go.\n\n507\n00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.580\n>> That's right.\n\n508\n00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.360\nNow Ronnie, I know that we have actually\nquite a bit more to talk about, when it\n\n509\n00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.060\ncomes to Azure Rights Management in Office\n365, trying to secure our environment.\n\n510\n00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.250\nBut looking at the clock here,\nwe're well out of time.\n\n511\n00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.700\nWe have completely exhausted\nevery last second.\n\n512\n00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.170\nSo that means Part 2.\n\n513\n00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:06.710\n>> It does.\n\n514\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.120\n>> So\nI look forward to seeing you guys there.\n\n515\n00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.070\nI look forward to seeing\nyou there as well.\n\n516\n00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.060\nThanks for\njoining us today signing off for\n\n517\n00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.280\nITpro.tv I've been your\nhost Daniel Lowrie.\n\n518\n00:28:14.280 -->

ITProTv.\n\n3\n00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.940\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and today,\nguess what, we're continuing on that train\n\n4\n00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.430\nof good old or managing Office\n365 identity and requirements.\n\n5\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.180\nJoining us again here in the studio is Mr.\nRonnie Wong to help us continue on\n\n6\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.370\nwhat we were, picking up where we\nleft off, right there, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.270\n>> Right, we were taking a look\nat Azure rights management.\n\n8\n00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.200\nSo remember that when we talk about\nOffice 365, they have a way that we can\n\n9\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.690\nuse Office 365 to help us to\nprotect our data regardless of what\n\n10\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.290\ndevices that they're on, regardless\nof where it's used on the planet.\n\n11\n00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.960\nIf you're going through Office 365,\n\n12\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.360\nyou have the ability to turn\non rights management features.\n\n13\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.180\nAnd behind that,\nthe engine of it, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.160\nis what we call Azure\nrights management services.\n\n15\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.868\nAnd that actually allows us of course\nthen once we get it activated, once we\n\n16\n00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:07.819\nenable it, it allows us to be able to use\nall of that and then we're ready to go.\n\n17\n00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:11.213\nSo in a previous episode we\nshowed you how to activate\n\n18\n00:01:11.213 --> 00:01:16.011\nthe rights management service through\nthe Office 365 admin console.\n\n19\n00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:21.676\nWe also then took you in a small\njourney here where we told you about\n\n20\n00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:27.060\nadding in the Azure Active Directory\nmodule for PowerShell.\n\n21\n00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.110\nSo that we can actually customize or\nreconfigure,\n\n22\n00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.410\ndo whatever we need to inside of\nthat rights management service,\n\n23\n00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.740\nbut using our PowerShell on\nthe machines that we're also on too.\n\n24\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.240\nSo when we actually do\nsomething like that,\n\n25\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.180\nwe've actually done all\nthrough PowerShell.\n\n26\n00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.540\nSo there's a great question here that we\nhave to be able to ask and answer as well.\n\n27\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.870\nWhy do we have to do it in PowerShell?\n\n28\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.990\nI think that's actually a valid question,\ndon't you, Daniel?\n\n29\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.800\n>> I would think so.\n\n30\n00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.390\nIn today's age, I don't know about you\nRonnie, but even though the command line\n\n31\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.790\nis fun and it makes us look like\nwe earn our money, I like GUIs.\n\n32\n00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.700\nThey're much more intuitive,\nit's easier to navigate through.\n\n33\n00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.030\nI see a check mark, I check it.\n\n34\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.890\nI know it's enabled.\n\n35\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.180\nIf it's not a check mark there,\nI know it's disabled.\n\n36\n00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.270\nI don't have to go through\na string of commands, so\n\n37\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.510\nwhy don't we use the GUI\nto make this happen?\n\n38\n00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.640\n>> Yeah, I think that is by far the most\nvalid question in the world and\n\n39\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.070\nyou're probably sitting there like, what!\n\n40\n00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.670\nYeah, that makes sense!\n\n41\n00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.520\nIt makes sense to you, it makes sense\nto me, it makes sense to Daniel.\n\n42\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.830\nWe're all in agreement but\nwe're not Microsoft Annual.\n\n43\n00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.000\nAnd that means, you know, the wisdom and\n\n44\n00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.400\nthe wonderkins over at\nMicrosoft have wisely decided\n\n45\n00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.330\nthat the way that you're actually able\nto do this stuff is, well, PowerShell.\n\n46\n00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.300\nI mean, that's what it comes down to.\n\n47\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.260\nSo, let me give you a for\ninstance here, right?\n\n48\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.230\nIt was easy enough to activate as your\nActive Directory rights management.\n\n49\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.700\nDaniel, you remember how easy it was,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.190\n>> Oh man, we walked through a nice little\ngraphical wizard there, we would have just\n\n51\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.280\nlogged into the Office 365, there's\na nice place to hit the activate button.\n\n52\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.920\nWe hit that and then activation was done.\n\n53\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.300\n>> Yeah.\n>> It was nice.\n\n54\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.879\n>> Yeah.\nThe funny thing is there's no button like\n\n55\n00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:02.680\nthat for enabling it.\n\n56\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.198\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, just a simple process of going.\n\n57\n00:03:07.198 --> 00:03:10.300\nYou mean to activate it,\nin other words, so that we can use it.\n\n58\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.870\nIt's in the GUI, it's in the portal.\n\n59\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.780\nBut to activate it we have\nto do it through PowerShell.\n\n60\n00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.440\nYeah.\n\n61\n00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.070\nAnd you're going to see a lot of\nthat stuff is kind of the same way.\n\n62\n00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.680\nThings that you and I might think is,\nhey, we'll do this through the GUI.\n\n63\n00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.180\nWell Microsoft has essentially said, no\nyou're going to do it through PowerShell.\n\n64\n00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.250\nSo that's why you have to actually worry\nabout things like this as well, so\n\n65\n00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.690\none of the things about rights management\nthen that we have to be able to control\n\n66\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.280\nis well, who is it that's gonna be\nin control of the rights management?\n\n67\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.780\nThat makes sense, right?\n\n68\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.780\nAnd normally, when we talk about\nactually doing something like this.\n\n69\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.380\nWe, of course,\nare gonna assign an administrator\n\n70\n00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.450\nto have essentially control over\nthese rights managements fields so\n\n71\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.680\nthat they can actually\ndo what they need to.\n\n72\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.410\nNow, normally when you're\nactually doing that,\n\n73\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.770\nright well how the heck do you do that?\n\n74\n00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.460\nWell you have to actually have to be\nable to go back in and be able to say,\n\n75\n00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.410\nhey we need to actually assign somebody\nthat can actually administer the right\n\n76\n00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.540\nmanagement itself, and once again if\nwe take a look at my computer here.\n\n77\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.640\nLet me show you a couple of things\nthat we can find inside of the portal.\n\n78\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.464\nSo if I go back to\nthe admin console here and\n\n79\n00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:21.848\nI have users that I know\nthat we can select this.\n\n80\n00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:23.848\nI'm going to click on Active Users here,\nand\n\n81\n00:04:23.848 --> 00:04:25.700\nhere's a list of some of the users I have.\n\n82\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.839\nI'm going to pick on Daniel's\nuser account right now.\n\n83\n00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:34.254\nIf I go to edit for Daniel's account,\n\n84\n00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:37.814\nand then I select Roles.\n\n85\n00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:42.443\nWell, Daniel, it actually looks like that\nit gives me this ability to kinda say,\n\n86\n00:04:42.443 --> 00:04:46.804\nhey, either I can give you global admin\nrights, that sounds pretty cool, or\n\n87\n00:04:46.804 --> 00:04:50.251\nlimited access rights, so\nI'll actually select that one.\n\n88\n00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:52.120\nIn other words,\nI just want you do rights management.\n\n89\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.470\nI should be able to see\na whole list down here and\n\n90\n00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.740\nguess what's not actually in here?\n\n91\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.490\nAzure, Active Directory,\nRights Management.\n\n92\n00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.170\nSo you have billing, you have password,\nyou have service, user management,\n\n93\n00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.580\nexchange, share point, and there's no\nscroll for me to go down any further.\n\n94\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.430\nThat's it.\n\n95\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.930\n>> So the reason we have to do it through\nPowerShell is simply by the fact that\n\n96\n00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.530\nthere is no graphical system that\nwill enable us to enable the system.\n\n97\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.550\n>> Yeah, and now, I'm not gonna say that\nit's not gonna change in the future.\n\n98\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.000\nOkay, so we've seen this.\n\n99\n00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.980\nAnd Daniel,\nyou've worked with exchange a lot.\n\n100\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.320\nI've worked with it a little bit.\n\n101\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.210\nThat where as like the later\neditions of exchange.\n\n102\n00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.030\nIt's like oh yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.970\nI used to be able to do this\nback in Exchange 2007 with this.\n\n104\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.621\nYou go to a newer version,\nlike oh, it's not there anymore.\n\n105\n00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:35.525\nAnd then you do research,\nand it says what.\n\n106\n00:05:35.525 --> 00:05:39.990\nYou're going to use that exchange manage,\nPowerShell management counsel instead.\n\n107\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.560\nAnd there's one or two reasons.\n\n108\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.780\nOne, they really don't either like the\nconsole that they had in the past or two,\n\n109\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.260\nthey just haven't actually\nbrought it up to date.\n\n110\n00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.500\nWhere they're like we're worried\nabout the GUI interface,\n\n111\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.980\nthey're really worried\nabout the functionality.\n\n112\n00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.490\nSo as they were actually\nproducing them out there,\n\n113\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.330\nit may be they're effective said look.\n\n114\n00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.410\nThere's the functionality there.\n\n115\n00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.070\nIt just takes them a few commands.\n\n116\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.010\nIf you're an administrator for this,\nthat shouldn't be too difficult for\n\n117\n00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.380\nyou to be able to learn, and\nthe same thing also applies here.\n\n118\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.250\nSo it could be later on where they\ndo come up with the software.\n\n119\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.110\nThat says all right, here's how you\nactually do this through this one console.\n\n120\n00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.690\nBut at this point you have to use both,\nso just kind of remember\n\n121\n00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.420\nthat that's why we do have to take\nthe time to learn a little bit of this.\n\n122\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.950\nSo the good thing is, now that we've\nactually added in that Active Directory\n\n123\n00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.980\nand rights management module, that means\nfrom the actual PowerShell we can also\n\n124\n00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.610\nassign essentially an active directory,\nrights management admin as well.\n\n125\n00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.770\nAnd that's what we are going to do too.\n\n126\n00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.420\nSo this actually allows us to make sure\nthat only the authorized people and\n\n127\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.660\nservices that we need can actually\ndo what we want them to do too.\n\n128\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.440\nOkay?\n\n129\n00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.420\nNow you might actually be thinking\nwhen you start to take a look at this\n\n130\n00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.260\nthat it's actually not\nvery difficult to do.\n\n131\n00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.000\nAnd it really isn't.\n\n132\n00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.440\nYou have to know a little\nbit of the commands, and\n\n133\n00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.940\nwe're gonna show you those here.\n\n134\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.010\nSo the first things I want to do\nis I want to connect back in to\n\n135\n00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:09.640\nthe Active Directory,\nAzure Active Directory rights management.\n\n136\n00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.998\nI'm trying to make sure I repeat that so\nthat I type it in right here.\n\n137\n00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:20.180\nService right here.\n\n138\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.410\nNow, earlier in another episode,\nI disconnected from, and\n\n139\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.970\nthat's why I'm actually\nconnecting back to it.\n\n140\n00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.370\nIt's always a good review for\n\n141\n00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.575\nus to actually be able to\ntake a look at this again.\n\n142\n00:07:28.575 --> 00:07:36.610\ntvdemo.com, and then I'm gonna paste in\nmy password right here and click okay.\n\n143\n00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.030\nAnd in a moment, it should actually,\nif I was able to paste correctly,\n\n144\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.060\ngive me another prompt that I can go to.\n\n145\n00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.375\nAnd there it is.\n\n146\n00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:45.972\nAnd it's actually connecting so\n\n147\n00:07:45.972 --> 00:07:49.190\nnow I have a connection into\nmy rights management console.\n\n148\n00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.315\nNow I wanna take a look at,\n\n149\n00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:53.090\nI was just looking at this link\nthat you actually see right here.\n\n150\n00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.057\nFor those of you that\nare gonna go on to doing\n\n151\n00:07:57.057 --> 00:08:01.035\nthe integration in with exchange online.\n\n152\n00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:05.305\nThis is actually going to be\nan important little tidbit right here.\n\n153\n00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:09.682\nAnd I'm trying to hover\nover these two letters,\n\n154\n00:08:09.682 --> 00:08:14.712\nwhere it says, https://admin.na.ADDRM.com.\n\n155\n00:08:14.712 --> 00:08:16.313\nNow this is regional, right?\n\n156\n00:08:16.313 --> 00:08:21.120\nSo I'm here in North America, so\nyou can see where it says na right here.\n\n157\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.576\nIf you're over in Europe, okay,\nyou should see EU probably pop up.\n\n158\n00:08:26.576 --> 00:08:29.753\nNot I'm not going to guarantee\nthat all the time, but\n\n159\n00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:32.798\nmore than likely you're\ngoing to see a set region.\n\n160\n00:08:32.798 --> 00:08:36.208\nIf you're in anywhere\nin Southeast Asia area,\n\n161\n00:08:36.208 --> 00:08:40.739\nyou are going to see that Asian Pacific\nand it is either PA or AP.\n\n162\n00:08:40.739 --> 00:08:46.021\nI can't remember which one you actually\nend up seeing there or maybe AS for Asia.\n\n163\n00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:49.005\nBut just kinda remember that\nif you see those letters and\n\n164\n00:08:49.005 --> 00:08:53.718\nit looks different on yours, I suggest you\npop in this command, that's probably why.\n\n165\n00:08:53.718 --> 00:08:56.983\nAnd the reason that is important\nas you do integrate this in with\n\n166\n00:08:56.983 --> 00:08:58.620\nthe exchange online.\n\n167\n00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.200\nThose two letters can\ncause you a little bit of\n\n168\n00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.145\nconsternation if you don't get them right.\n\n169\n00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:06.630\nSo when you actually type it in and\n\n170\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.340\nit tells you, yeah, I can't find\nthat server that you're pointing to.\n\n171\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.220\nMake sure you actually have added\nin those correct letters there or\n\n172\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.130\nyou probably won't actually get\nconnected the way that you need to.\n\n173\n00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.320\nSo that's just a little hint for\nus to think about.\n\n174\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.000\nSo once we're actually here and\nwe are now logged into our service,\n\n175\n00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.220\nI wanna see a list of my\nrights management admin.\n\n176\n00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.025\nOkay, so I'm gonna type in get-addrm and\nthen once,\n\n177\n00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:35.590\noh sorry,\nI didn't typed in enough letters here.\n\n178\n00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.665\nSo Aadc,\nthat's probably what happened here.\n\n179\n00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:43.369\nAadrRoleBasedAdministrator.\n\n180\n00:09:43.369 --> 00:09:47.641\nSo remember that we can use that tab fill\nand we were talking about even during\n\n181\n00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:51.800\nour break, it really does help when\nthis stuff happens cuz that's long.\n\n182\n00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.740\nThat thing just kills me.\n\n183\n00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.040\nAnd notice how some of them\nare also capitalized as well.\n\n184\n00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.488\nSo it looks like that\nthey're improper case.\n\n185\n00:10:00.488 --> 00:10:03.675\nI can actually type a majority\nof this in all lowercase, and\n\n186\n00:10:03.675 --> 00:10:06.729\nthen at the end of it, I hit Tab,\nand it will fill it out and\n\n187\n00:10:06.729 --> 00:10:09.183\ngive us the proper case\nanyways if we need to.\n\n188\n00:10:09.183 --> 00:10:12.832\nAnd then I'm gonna press Enter and\nlet it go through and\n\n189\n00:10:12.832 --> 00:10:16.230\ntell me who my\nRights Management Admins are.\n\n190\n00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.710\nAnd Daniel, you'll notice something\nright here if you take a look.\n\n191\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.570\nIt was given a command to get the entire\nlist of rights administrators, and we've\n\n192\n00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:30.590\nturned it on, we've activated it, it's\nenabled, but look at who can control this.\n\n193\n00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:31.450\n>> Zero people.\n\n194\n00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.830\n>> Nobody actually the ability to\ngo in and modify and do anything.\n\n195\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.250\nSo we want to integrate it in with\nSharepoint, we wanted to actually be able\n\n196\n00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.810\nto integrate this in with Exchange,\nwe don't have that ability to do so.\n\n197\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:51.000\nSo usually that means you have to have at\nleast one person to be able to do this.\n\n198\n00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.630\nOkay.\n\n199\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.020\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate this person's account.\n\n200\n00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.848\nThe nice thing is it is\nactually kind of easy for\n\n201\n00:10:57.848 --> 00:11:04.033\nus to do this cuz we're actually going\nto take that same kind of thing here,\n\n202\n00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:08.157\nwhere it says AadmRoleBasedAdministrator,\nand\n\n203\n00:11:08.157 --> 00:11:11.787\nwe're going to type in\nadd instead of get and\n\n204\n00:11:11.787 --> 00:11:16.716\nthen AadrmRoleBasedAdministrator,\nand we'll do that.\n\n205\n00:11:16.716 --> 00:11:21.093\nOh, whoops, I forgot to actually add in\nsomething which is actually who's gonna be\n\n206\n00:11:21.093 --> 00:11:23.390\nthis, so let me go ahead and\ndo that as well.\n\n207\n00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:28.940\nAnd we're gonna do email address,\nand this time I'm gonna use Daniel.\n\n208\n00:11:33.456 --> 00:11:38.629\nAt itprotvdemo.com and close that and\n\n209\n00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:43.649\npress Enter and we'll give it a name.\n\n210\n00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:47.828\nSo now, here it is and you actually\nsee we get a confirmation, Daniel.\n\n211\n00:11:47.828 --> 00:11:53.126\nIt says Daniel@itprotvdemo.com was\nadded to the list of administrators for\n\n212\n00:11:53.126 --> 00:11:55.890\nthe Rights Management service.\n\n213\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.450\nSo this now, if I go back and see,\nif I can run that same command.\n\n214\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.398\nI'm just using my up arrow now.\n\n215\n00:12:02.398 --> 00:12:03.734\nAnd let's see what happens here.\n\n216\n00:12:03.734 --> 00:12:05.180\n>> We get an actual list this time.\n\n217\n00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.120\n>> Yep, you actually get a list\nof what you need right here.\n\n218\n00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.680\nAnd so now we're actually able to see,\nthere it is, Daniel Lowrie is here and\n\n219\n00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.120\nhere's his email address, his role is now\nalso part of that global administrator.\n\n220\n00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.550\nBut even more so\n\n221\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:26.340\nit's because he's also going to be\ndoing that Rights Admin role as well.\n\n222\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.270\nAnd then his, of course,\nhis little object ID.\n\n223\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.090\nOver here on the left-hand side,\nthat may be needed for something else.\n\n224\n00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.347\n>> So, Ronnie,\ncan you be a global administrator and\n\n225\n00:12:34.347 --> 00:12:36.302\nnot be a Rights Management Administrator?\n\n226\n00:12:36.302 --> 00:12:40.188\n>> Not necessarily so usually the global\nadministrator has access to everything but\n\n227\n00:12:40.188 --> 00:12:42.280\nnotice that he's not actually named here.\n\n228\n00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.970\nSo I'm actually the global administrator\nbut my email account didn't come up here.\n\n229\n00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.050\nSo it's assumed by default\nthat's what's gonna happen.\n\n230\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.050\nBut normally inside of a larger domain,\nwe want actually distribute this or\n\n231\n00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.740\ndelegate as much of this as possible.\n\n232\n00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.690\nSo in that way, one person\ndoesn't have everything on hand.\n\n233\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.420\nThe global administrator always is there\nto essentially as being a backup make sure\n\n234\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.990\nthat the tenant is actually created and\neverything that we need to.\n\n235\n00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.715\nBut here we can actually add him in and\nwe are ready to go.\n\n236\n00:13:09.715 --> 00:13:14.227\nThe other thing,\nof course then is that it may be where you\n\n237\n00:13:14.227 --> 00:13:19.397\nactually don't want Daniel as\nthe actual administrator again.\n\n238\n00:13:19.397 --> 00:13:20.732\nSo the good thing is actually easy.\n\n239\n00:13:20.732 --> 00:13:23.250\nWe're not going to remove him but\nI will show you the command here.\n\n240\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.098\nIt's easy.\n\n241\n00:13:24.098 --> 00:13:29.335\nAgain which is, we would simply type in\nremove, okay, in place of the word add.\n\n242\n00:13:29.335 --> 00:13:33.758\nAnd so this is very important too because\nwhat happens inside of IT departments?\n\n243\n00:13:33.758 --> 00:13:38.030\nPeople do end up coming on board and\nthis may be their specialty.\n\n244\n00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.412\nBut the very fact is they also leave and\n\n245\n00:13:40.412 --> 00:13:45.413\nyou don't want to leave them as a global\nadministrator for your Office 365.\n\n246\n00:13:45.413 --> 00:13:48.589\nYou don't wanna leave them as\nactually being administrator for\n\n247\n00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:51.820\nrights management inside\nof your organization.\n\n248\n00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.640\nSo just remember, if you do need to remove\nthem, you have to be able to do this.\n\n249\n00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.110\nNow, the other thing that you also have\nto be able to do and understand is this.\n\n250\n00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.200\nFor this type especially, on the admins,\n\n251\n00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.620\nfor the rights management here,\nyou cannot add in groups, security groups.\n\n252\n00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.260\nSo I can't just say, Daniel, let's just\nadd in the entire IT department in there,\n\n253\n00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.950\nand create a security group\nto add them in there.\n\n254\n00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:18.630\nIf I'm going to do that,\nI need to add in the individual users for\n\n255\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.460\nmy IT department to do so.\n\n256\n00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.650\nSo we can't just take a group name, say\nmarketing, or admins, or whatever it is.\n\n257\n00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.080\nWe need to actually make sure that\nwe add in individual names here and\n\n258\n00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.120\nnot necessarily groups as well.\n\n259\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.110\n>> Ronnie, do you actually know\ntheir reasoning behind that?\n\n260\n00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.918\nCuz I know that Microsoft is huge about\nthe old ADGLP system where you're all\n\n261\n00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.823\nabout assigning rights to groups, so\n\n262\n00:14:38.823 --> 00:14:43.080\nI all I have to do is put somebody in the\ngroup and they have their correct rights.\n\n263\n00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.120\nSo are you aware of their reasoning\nbehind doing it this way with this?\n\n264\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.240\n>> I don't know about the reasoning but\n\n265\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.720\nthere's gotta be something funky with like\nthe object ID thing that they're doing.\n\n266\n00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.420\nAnd that's the only thing\nthat I can find out.\n\n267\n00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.951\nBut that is what their recommendation is.\n\n268\n00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:57.583\nI'm sure people have tried it and\nit's just not worked and\n\n269\n00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:59.525\nthey've been given some error behind it.\n\n270\n00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:01.652\nBut I didn't actually\nlook up that error so\n\n271\n00:15:01.652 --> 00:15:04.725\nthere's probably a reasoning behind it but\nI just don't know\n\n272\n00:15:04.725 --> 00:15:08.810\nwhat the full reasoning behind that\nactually is going to be as well.\n\n273\n00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.830\nNow, sometimes though,\nwhen you start doing this here.\n\n274\n00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:19.700\nI'm actually telling you, I was thinking\nabout something different, okay?\n\n275\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.230\nSo this is where I make\na mistake completely.\n\n276\n00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.860\nYou can add in security groups here.\n\n277\n00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.830\nWe're about to talk about the superuser.\n\n278\n00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.522\nAnd that's the one we actually\ncan't add in groups to.\n\n279\n00:15:28.522 --> 00:15:31.492\nSo I was just looking down on my notes\nlike, I know that it's one of these, and\n\n280\n00:15:31.492 --> 00:15:33.259\nthen I looked down and\nI realized something.\n\n281\n00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:37.712\nDaniel, you're absolutely right and I am\nwrong in this, because I looked down and\n\n282\n00:15:37.712 --> 00:15:40.650\nI just realized,\nyou can add in security groups here.\n\n283\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.940\n>> That cart got in front of\nthe horse again, didn't it?\n\n284\n00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.600\n>> That was me, and that's what happens\nwhen we talk about superusers in the end,\n\n285\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.830\nwell, you can't do that.\n\n286\n00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.380\nAnd then the actual regular\nadd administrators where\n\n287\n00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.490\nyou can add in groups, but\nas a superuser you can.\n\n288\n00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.341\nAnd we need to distinguish\nbetween those in a moment.\n\n289\n00:15:56.341 --> 00:16:00.232\nSo there is a way to do that, and\nlet me go ahead and add in a group here,\n\n290\n00:16:00.232 --> 00:16:03.141\neven though I don't really\nhave a I grouped add it.\n\n291\n00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:06.127\nLet me remove this and then we'll do that.\n\n292\n00:16:06.127 --> 00:16:12.181\nSo, all right, so,\nthe other one here is, I'm gonna do Add,\n\n293\n00:16:12.181 --> 00:16:17.346\nand then Aadrm here, and\nRoleBasedAdministrator.\n\n294\n00:16:17.346 --> 00:16:22.980\nAnd it's here that we type\nin SecurityGroupDisplayName.\n\n295\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.432\nNow, I would have never\ncome up with that either.\n\n296\n00:16:25.432 --> 00:16:30.700\nSo SecurityGroupDisplayName, and let's\nsay that I have a group called Hosts.\n\n297\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.504\nBut it's not actually inside\nof my Office 365 yet,\n\n298\n00:16:35.504 --> 00:16:38.400\nlet's see if it actually\nwill take it here.\n\n299\n00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.810\nIt may balk at it,\nbecause it may check it and go, look,\n\n300\n00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.070\nI don't like this because I\ndon't see that group name.\n\n301\n00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.420\nBut you can actually add\nin a group of people.\n\n302\n00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.250\nSo, if they're actually ready there,\nit is very possible here.\n\n303\n00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.473\nSo it's-\n>> It's just waiting for it?\n\n304\n00:16:52.473 --> 00:16:56.452\n>> Yeah, I didn't actually create\nthe group at the beginning there on Office\n\n305\n00:16:56.452 --> 00:17:00.806\n365, but if I did create the group, it\nwould go and find that group and say yes,\n\n306\n00:17:00.806 --> 00:17:03.560\nyou can actually add those users in there.\n\n307\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.150\nAnd so, for\n\n308\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:09.110\nthe admin rights, you can add in a group,\nI was absolutely 100% wrong there.\n\n309\n00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:12.140\nSo individual users or\ngroups, and Daniel is right.\n\n310\n00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.109\nBy the way that Microsoft normally\ndoes active directory, the individuals\n\n311\n00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:20.150\nto groups, you know, to stuff like that,\nwe always follow that procedure.\n\n312\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.076\n>> And that's with the role-based\nadministrator right?\n\n313\n00:17:22.076 --> 00:17:23.263\n>> Role-based administrator.\n\n314\n00:17:23.263 --> 00:17:24.181\n>> We're with you, Ronnie.\n\n315\n00:17:24.181 --> 00:17:25.418\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah it is, yeah, you know,\n\n316\n00:17:25.418 --> 00:17:28.182\nthat's what happens when I look at\nnotes and they're so close together.\n\n317\n00:17:28.182 --> 00:17:31.930\nI know one of these only allows you\nto do single, but this is it, okay?\n\n318\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.857\nNow, let's go back to\nthe single idea here,\n\n319\n00:17:33.857 --> 00:17:36.306\nwhere I was absolutely\nmisleading everybody out there.\n\n320\n00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:40.592\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There is something that we call a super\n\n321\n00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:41.932\nuser account.\n\n322\n00:17:41.932 --> 00:17:44.455\nAnd the reason why we need this, okay,\n\n323\n00:17:44.455 --> 00:17:47.670\nlet's go ahead and\ntalk about a couple of things.\n\n324\n00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.170\nRights administrators,\nfor the Azure stuff,\n\n325\n00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:57.540\nfor Office 365, they have\nthe ability to control those rights.\n\n326\n00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.210\nThey can delete the rights,\nthey can change it, they can modify it,\n\n327\n00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:01.900\nthey can get rid of it.\n\n328\n00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.480\nThey can add it back in, they can do\nwhatever they want to their rights.\n\n329\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.100\nBut remember that all\nof this is about what?\n\n330\n00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.310\nData protection itself.\n\n331\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.210\nThere are scenarios though,\nin which we need administrators, okay?\n\n332\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.160\nTo be able to go in and\nlook at the data if we need to.\n\n333\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.570\nSo a perfect example of that\nis what we had just mentioned,\n\n334\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.620\nis that sometimes people do work in the\norganization, and they do end up leaving.\n\n335\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.806\nBut we still need to recover their data,\nokay?\n\n336\n00:18:25.806 --> 00:18:29.718\nBecause, it is now, you know,\nlocked into their particular user account,\n\n337\n00:18:29.718 --> 00:18:32.092\nthe very fact is we still\nneed to recover that.\n\n338\n00:18:32.092 --> 00:18:34.660\nWell rights administrators do not\n\n339\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.490\nhave the ability to do that if they\ncan't actually look at the data.\n\n340\n00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:38.670\nThey're not going to be able to do so.\n\n341\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:43.470\nSo even though they can control\nthe overall process, and the overall\n\n342\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.810\nstructure, they don't have the ability to\ngo in and modify or change data, okay?\n\n343\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:52.270\nThe other thing that can also happen is\nlike with individual exchange mailboxes\n\n344\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.210\ntoo, or stuff like that,\nif it actually needs to be indexed.\n\n345\n00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.740\nWell, even the rights\nadministrators can't actually index\n\n346\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.200\na ready encrypted types of mailboxes.\n\n347\n00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.280\nBut, with a super user account,\nthey can as well.\n\n348\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.400\nSo that's what needs to also happen too,\nis that someone inside of\n\n349\n00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.320\nyour organization is probably gonna\nend up getting accesses role.\n\n350\n00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.045\nAnd more than likely,\n\n351\n00:19:13.045 --> 00:19:15.610\nit's gonna be the global administrator\nwho ends up getting access.\n\n352\n00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.600\nBut it can be delegated out and\nthat's pretty much the key.\n\n353\n00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.330\n>> Well, Ronnie, now that we have\nthe role-based administrator set or\n\n354\n00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.690\na group of role-based administrator\nset up, we're good to go, right?\n\n355\n00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.630\nWe've got the all knowing,\nall seeing, dictators of our system.\n\n356\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.010\nWe're able to assign rights and\n\n357\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.472\ndo anything that we want to\ndo with those people, right?\n\n358\n00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:36.620\n>> Just about, right,\nthat is not exactly everything, okay?\n\n359\n00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.430\nWith the rights management guys, right?\n\n360\n00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.220\nThey do have complete\ncontrol over that ability\n\n361\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.780\nto do some of the things\nthat they really need to do.\n\n362\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.290\nBut there comes an issue and\nthere comes a point, right?\n\n363\n00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:54.340\nSo they are kind of sovereign over\nthe very fact that they can administrate.\n\n364\n00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.390\nThe fact that we're using\nrights management and\n\n365\n00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.330\nwe're not actually doing anything else.\n\n366\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.300\nWe can hand over that control.\n\n367\n00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.530\nBut there are still a few things that\nthe rights administrators cannot do,\n\n368\n00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.050\nthe rights management admins cannot do.\n\n369\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.770\nAnd that is to actually be\nable to essentially look\n\n370\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.780\nat the user's data that we're protecting.\n\n371\n00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.457\nAnd that is very important\nbecause there are scenarios,\n\n372\n00:20:18.457 --> 00:20:22.211\nthere are things that end up\nhappening to organizations,\n\n373\n00:20:22.211 --> 00:20:26.380\nin which we still need to able\nto prevent the loss of data.\n\n374\n00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:31.670\nAnd even though rights management\nhelps us to prevent some loss of data,\n\n375\n00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.930\nthere are some things it cannot do unless\nwe give them the permission to do so.\n\n376\n00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:40.470\nSo there is another level of\nthis idea of the rights admin\n\n377\n00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.120\nthat we call the super user feature,\nthat we also need to enable.\n\n378\n00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.840\nNow, you might be wondering about\nsome of those scenarios, right?\n\n379\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.910\nSo let me kind of give you\nan example of a couple of scenarios.\n\n380\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.380\nAn organization that has\nemployees that end up leaving, and\n\n381\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.990\nthey have sensitive data that\nwe still need to recover.\n\n382\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.370\nWell, the admin rights,\nor the rights admin,\n\n383\n00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.290\nwhy am I not gonna be able to say that.\n\n384\n00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:09.560\nThe rights management, the admins, they\ncan't touch that data, it's encrypted.\n\n385\n00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.700\nAnd they're not actually\nallowed to view that data,\n\n386\n00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.630\nbut it still needs to be recovered.\n\n387\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.170\nWell, you might think, well, they're\nin charge of the data loss prevention\n\n388\n00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.860\nby using this rights management.\n\n389\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.952\nBut yeah, they're not able to\ngo to an individual user and\n\n390\n00:21:20.952 --> 00:21:23.014\nactually pull that data,\nthat's absolutely correct.\n\n391\n00:21:23.014 --> 00:21:25.097\nThey're not able to do\nsomething like that.\n\n392\n00:21:25.097 --> 00:21:30.710\nThe other thing is also is the ability\nto remove current protection.\n\n393\n00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:35.200\nAnd also to be able to configure and apply\ndifferent policies that are there for\n\n394\n00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.700\nindividual users too.\n\n395\n00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.280\nSo, even though they have the ability\nto say, all right, we're using this and\n\n396\n00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.580\nhow we can control some of it,\nfor users they can't do that.\n\n397\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.683\nEven for exchange mailboxes, as well,\nto index to protected mailboxes,\n\n398\n00:21:46.683 --> 00:21:49.431\nthey're not actually\nallowed to do that either.\n\n399\n00:21:49.431 --> 00:21:53.439\nSo, there's a couple of different\nscenarios out there that you do have to\n\n400\n00:21:53.439 --> 00:21:54.223\nworry about.\n\n401\n00:21:54.223 --> 00:21:56.043\nAnd so, what has to happen then,\n\n402\n00:21:56.043 --> 00:22:00.530\nis that even though we can actually assign\nindividual users as being the admins for\n\n403\n00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:04.432\nrights management, or groups as\nbeing admins for rights management,\n\n404\n00:22:04.432 --> 00:22:08.510\nwe talk about the idea of bringing\nin the super user feature.\n\n405\n00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:11.431\nThis is the one, and this is where\nI got it completely wrong before.\n\n406\n00:22:11.431 --> 00:22:16.048\nThis is the one that can only be\ndone with an individual account, and\n\n407\n00:22:16.048 --> 00:22:19.410\nnot a complete group of accounts instead.\n\n408\n00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:24.285\nSo, we only assign them to really a few\npeople instead when we start doing this.\n\n409\n00:22:24.285 --> 00:22:27.030\nNow, if you don't have this, right?\n\n410\n00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:30.230\nThere is a possibility you\nare gonna still lose data.\n\n411\n00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.510\nSo not only do you need the admins for\nrights management to be there,\n\n412\n00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.590\nin terms of that role based feature\nthat Daniel was talking about, but\n\n413\n00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.880\nwe're also gonna probably need at least\none, that's gonna be this super user,\n\n414\n00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.520\nthat's gonna have the super\nuser feature enabled for them.\n\n415\n00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.886\nIf we need to do some of the scenarios\nthat we talked about, and\n\n416\n00:22:47.886 --> 00:22:50.940\nthere's a few more out there that\nyou can look up and see too.\n\n417\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.090\nSo, it has to be a combination\nof these things.\n\n418\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:58.811\nThe key here is just trying to remember,\nyou know, when do I use that or,\n\n419\n00:22:58.811 --> 00:23:02.640\nyou know, in what situation,\nespecially us preparing for the exam,\n\n420\n00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.930\nthat I would need that idea of that super\nuser account to be able to do this.\n\n421\n00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.680\nAnd so, when you actually think\nabout that, then you know,\n\n422\n00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.070\nis it gonna be the rights, you know,\nthe normal administrator for\n\n423\n00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.890\nrights management that has to do this?\n\n424\n00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.350\nOr is it somebody that actually has\nto have that super user feature too?\n\n425\n00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:25.310\nNow just like the way that we talked\nabout enabling rights management, right?\n\n426\n00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:30.230\nWell, we also can enable\nthis super user feature too.\n\n427\n00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.055\nAnd make sure that it works, as well.\n\n428\n00:23:32.055 --> 00:23:36.645\nNow this is also a two-step process for\nus, so something that we really\n\n429\n00:23:36.645 --> 00:23:41.638\nwant to make sure that we pay attention\nto as we bring this up here, all right?\n\n430\n00:23:41.638 --> 00:23:44.130\nSo, let's go ahead and do this.\n\n431\n00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.650\nNow, I'm actually using this\nAzure Active Directory Module for\n\n432\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.240\nWindows PowerShell here to help us out.\n\n433\n00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.046\nSo from the PowerShell command,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n434\n00:23:54.046 --> 00:23:56.886\nconnect back in to the AADRM service.\n\n435\n00:23:56.886 --> 00:24:00.967\nAnd even though I know that I'm\nactually connected right now,\n\n436\n00:24:00.967 --> 00:24:06.130\nthis is something, again, that may Be\nsomething that you actually want to do.\n\n437\n00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:11.177\nSo it's just, at least for\nme, a safety check demo.\n\n438\n00:24:12.863 --> 00:24:14.571\nCome on.\n\n439\n00:24:16.988 --> 00:24:18.857\nBe sure I paste that password in.\n\n440\n00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:21.375\nAnd it's always nice to verify\nthat you are connected and\n\n441\n00:24:21.375 --> 00:24:22.696\nthen that your ready to work.\n\n442\n00:24:22.696 --> 00:24:25.695\nOr, this may not be something that\nyou do right after a string of other\n\n443\n00:24:25.695 --> 00:24:26.480\nthings, right?\n\n444\n00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.120\nSo, making sure that it's actually up and\nready is what you wanna do.\n\n445\n00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:35.316\nTo enable the feature,\nit's simply Enable-,\n\n446\n00:24:35.316 --> 00:24:42.830\nand it's right here that we do aadrm,\nand then SuperUserFeature.\n\n447\n00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:46.770\nAnd it's simple enough to actually\nbe able to remember, okay.\n\n448\n00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:51.966\nSo if I go ahead and press Enter there,\nthat should now enable that feature.\n\n449\n00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:55.580\nAnd now you should get a confirmation,\nThe super user feature is enabled for\n\n450\n00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.003\nRights Management service.\n\n451\n00:24:57.003 --> 00:25:00.940\nBut you're not done, okay, so\njust like we talked with activation,\n\n452\n00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:06.100\nand then making sure that we turn that\nservice on, or enable that service.\n\n453\n00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.000\nHere we enabled the service so\n\n454\n00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.170\nthat we know that the super\nuser feature can be enabled.\n\n455\n00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:15.260\nBut it doesn't work until you actually\nassign a administrator to it, okay.\n\n456\n00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.917\nSo that is the actual key for\nus next here.\n\n457\n00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:22.851\nSo, again, fairly easy,\n\n458\n00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:27.790\nwe Add-AadrmSuperUser.\n\n459\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.550\nAnd from this point,\nyou have a couple of options.\n\n460\n00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.910\nIf I leave it like this,\nit'll still work, let me go and show you.\n\n461\n00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.710\nSo I'm just gonna leave\nit as Add SuperUser.\n\n462\n00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.640\nAnd then it's asking me for\nan email address.\n\n463\n00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.405\nI could've also simply typed in a dash, or\n\n464\n00:25:41.405 --> 00:25:45.520\nused the option EmailAddress at\nthe end and typed in who I wanted to.\n\n465\n00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:54.490\nAnd this one I'm gonna\nmike@itprotvdemo.com, and press Enter.\n\n466\n00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.158\nAnd here it should actually go out and\nfind the account, and there it is.\n\n467\n00:25:59.158 --> 00:26:02.370\nSo now he is also added to\nthe list of super users,\n\n468\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:07.650\nand now we have our super user\nadministrator for us and ready to go.\n\n469\n00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.380\nSo remember that with the super user,\n\n470\n00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:14.293\nright, he can access protected data,\neven when the user leaves the company.\n\n471\n00:26:14.293 --> 00:26:17.680\nOkay, so that's actually a big help\nthat we can actually think about.\n\n472\n00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.330\nHe can change any of the policies\nthat are already in place for\n\n473\n00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.555\nus, even after they've been applied.\n\n474\n00:26:23.555 --> 00:26:26.330\nSo that's something that is kind of neat.\n\n475\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:30.460\nThat, essentially, if a policy is applied\nto Daniel's account, he can actually go in\n\n476\n00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.025\nand change those Rights Management\nfeatures for Daniel if he needs to.\n\n477\n00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:37.010\nIndex the protected email boxes as well.\n\n478\n00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.610\nBe able to perform things like\nbulk decryption when we need to.\n\n479\n00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:43.940\nYou name it, there's a lot of\nthings that can actually be done.\n\n480\n00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.160\nNow, we just showed you how\nto manually enable it and\n\n481\n00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.320\nset who the administrator is.\n\n482\n00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.340\nIf you decide that you're\ngonna actually extend, and\n\n483\n00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.060\nthis is probably what you'll end up doing.\n\n484\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.945\nIs not only Rights Management for\nOffice 365, but\n\n485\n00:26:55.945 --> 00:26:59.547\nyou choose to extend it out to,\nof course, your Exchange Server.\n\n486\n00:26:59.547 --> 00:27:04.454\nBy default, once you choose to extend that\nout, whoever's actually logged in doing\n\n487\n00:27:04.454 --> 00:27:09.470\nit with their credentials, that person\nwill become the super user anyways.\n\n488\n00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.790\nSo, you have two options there, right.\n\n489\n00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.380\nIf you need a super user account,\nyou can either go ahead and\n\n490\n00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.720\ndo the Integrated Rights Management for\nExchange Online,\n\n491\n00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.740\nand that will automatically\nadded in there.\n\n492\n00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.420\nOr manually,\nyou do it the way that we showed you, and\n\n493\n00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.543\nthat will allow you to have\nthat feature available.\n\n494\n00:27:24.543 --> 00:27:30.040\nSo, even though the role-based types of\nRights Management admins that we've talked\n\n495\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.560\nabout is exactly what we need to make sure\nthat we have somebody in control of it.\n\n496\n00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.680\nTo be able to have full and\nactive control as well,\n\n497\n00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.130\nwe need to make sure that we also have\nsomebody doing the super user feature.\n\n498\n00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.522\nThat will really help us to\nrecover data that is lost and\n\n499\n00:27:44.522 --> 00:27:48.375\ndo some of the things that the even\nthe right admins can't do.\n\n500\n00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:50.281\n>> Awesome, now is that going to be, well,\n\n501\n00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:52.520\nwithin the scope of what\nwe're doing right now?\n\n502\n00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.990\nAre we gonna get into that\na little bit later or?\n\n503\n00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.650\n>> Yeah, we're gonna get into\nthat a little bit later on here.\n\n504\n00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:02.460\nSo, we're not doing too much more than\njust making sure that we understand\n\n505\n00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.070\nwhat the role of that super user is, and\nwhat the role of the Rights Management is.\n\n506\n00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.290\nAnd remember that we don't have a portal\n\n507\n00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.230\naccess to be able to set\nthat stuff up as well.\n\n508\n00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.380\nAnd that's why we have to do\nit here in the PowerShell.\n\n509\n00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:18.697\nSo knowing those commands, understanding\nthe concepts that we talked about here,\n\n510\n00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:22.243\nare gonna help you way on your way\ntowards getting ready for the exam.\n\n511\n00:28:22.243 --> 00:28:25.407\nAs well as, as you start setting\nthis up for your roll out or\n\n512\n00:28:25.407 --> 00:28:27.292\nyour migration to Office 365.\n\n513\n00:28:27.292 --> 00:28:30.747\n>> So, memorize for your exam,\nand then create a cheat sheet for\n\n514\n00:28:30.747 --> 00:28:32.817\nin real life, that's how it works.\n\n515\n00:28:32.817 --> 00:28:34.098\nOr Google it, obviously, right?\n\n516\n00:28:34.098 --> 00:28:35.003\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah that's-\n>> And\n\n517\n00:28:35.003 --> 00:28:37.736\nwelcome to real IT systems administration.\n\n518\n00:28:37.736 --> 00:28:39.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Google is your friend.\n\n519\n00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.830\nRonnie, is there anything else we need to\ncover before we close this episode down?\n\n520\n00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.365\n>> Not really for anything dealing with\nthe idea of this Rights Management, right?\n\n521\n00:28:46.365 --> 00:28:49.880\n>> There is a lot more than\nwhat we've showed you here.\n\n522\n00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.530\nBut just getting it enabled is one of\nthe first things that we have to do.\n\n523\n00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.300\nMost of the other things dealing with\nthe SharePoint and the Exchange,\n\n524\n00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.300\nit will become more customized depending\nhow your Exchange Server is set up.\n\n525\n00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.350\nSo you do have to actually\nfigure stuff out like that.\n\n526\n00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:08.430\nBut overall though, here's the basics\nthat will at least get you started and\n\n527\n00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:12.960\nget your understanding what things must be\nin place before you can actually use them.\n\n528\n00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.522\n>> Awesome, well thank you so\nmuch for joining us today and\n\n529\n00:29:15.522 --> 00:29:17.975\nshowing us how to enable this,\nget this thing going so\n\n530\n00:29:17.975 --> 00:29:21.570\nthat we can use Rights Management to\nour advantage in our environments.\n\n531\n00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:23.877\nThank you guys for watching,\nwe enjoy having you everyday,\n\n532\n00:29:23.877 --> 00:29:25.244\nwe always appreciate our viewers.\n\n533\n00:29:25.244 --> 00:29:29.325\nBut we are ready to sign off for ITProTV,\nI've been your

They begin by explaining that Office365 uses role based permissions and that is done through role-based administrators. They describe the 8 Administrator roles, Global, Billing, Password, Service, User Management, Exchange Online, Sharepoint Online, and Skype for Business Online admins. Finally they show you how to enable these roles for the necessary user(s), using both the Portal and PowerShell.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.393 --> 00:00:21.326\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on our lovely\n\n4\n00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:25.425\ntopic of managing Office 365\nidentities and responsibilities.\n\n5\n00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.145\nRight, is that correct?\n\n6\n00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:26.749\n>> Requirements.\n\n7\n00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:27.271\n>> Requirements.\n\n8\n00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:27.990\n>> That's right [LAUGH].\n\n9\n00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.649\n>> It's is a difficult topic to say,\nit's quite a mouthful.\n\n10\n00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.733\nAs you can see, joining me today in the\nstudio, none other than my good man, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.467\nRonnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:36.443\nRonnie how you doing today, sir?\n\n13\n00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:41.183\n>> I am doing fine, it's another great day\nfor us to continue to take a look at well,\n\n14\n00:00:41.183 --> 00:00:43.222\nagain, managing Office 365.\n\n15\n00:00:43.222 --> 00:00:45.874\nAnd we already talked about so\nmuch stuff, and\n\n16\n00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:50.022\nnow we're gonna move into the realm\nof actually taking a look at, well,\n\n17\n00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:53.630\ndifferent models of administration\nthat we can have, right?\n\n18\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.590\nInside our own organizations,\nwe've got a hierarchy that we've set up,\n\n19\n00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.680\nwe've got everything else\nthe way that we want to.\n\n20\n00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.240\nOur IT department is functioning\nthe way that we want to.\n\n21\n00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.140\n>> But when we go to Office 365,\nthat kind of model really does fall down.\n\n22\n00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.944\nI hate to say it, it does,\nbecause remember that what we've actually\n\n23\n00:01:10.944 --> 00:01:13.657\ndone is we've really\ndistributed the workload.\n\n24\n00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:16.989\nOffice 365 now is handling our servers for\n\n25\n00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:20.679\njust about everything\non the Office 365 side.\n\n26\n00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.150\nThey're also part of the distribution\nmodel, right, the deployment of software.\n\n27\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.950\nIf you want Office 365 to be on\nindividual workstation machines anymore,\n\n28\n00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.410\nwell this no longer means that Daniel\nhas to keep up deployment servers for\n\n29\n00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.870\nhim to just push out\nsoftware if he needs to.\n\n30\n00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.510\nAnd even handle the updating,\nif new versions of Office 365 or Office\n\n31\n00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.100\nproduct comes out, they also, of course,\nwill have latest version of it too.\n\n32\n00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.660\nSo when the users log in they can\nactually go ahead and download and\n\n33\n00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.120\ninstall the Office Suite\non their computers as well.\n\n34\n00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.323\nSo you name it,\nthey've actually taken a bit of\n\n35\n00:01:57.323 --> 00:02:01.019\nthe load as far as what we\nhave to do with Office 365.\n\n36\n00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:02.027\nBut even so,\n\n37\n00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:08.010\nit doesn't mean that we actually can\njust let it be whatever it wants to.\n\n38\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.152\nWe need to make sure that we have\nthe administrative rights that we need\n\n39\n00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:15.109\nassigned out and\ndelegated to who we also need to.\n\n40\n00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.803\nSo we need to implement a permission\nmodel that will help us to distribute\n\n41\n00:02:18.803 --> 00:02:20.340\nthe workload.\n\n42\n00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.420\nCan you, as a small company, implement\nit as a single administrator role and\n\n43\n00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.720\nthat's all that's done?\n\n44\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.100\nYes, when you begin to work inside\nthat small business model or\n\n45\n00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.630\neven down to the single individual\nplans that are out there for\n\n46\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.920\nsubscriptions, that's all\nyou're ever gonna do.\n\n47\n00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.910\nBut once you start working in that\nmidsize to your enterprise models,\n\n48\n00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.990\nright, you need to have\nseparated roles out.\n\n49\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.827\nBecause Office 365 really does work\nunderneath the role based access types of\n\n50\n00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:51.757\npolicies that we want to set up.\n\n51\n00:02:51.757 --> 00:02:56.640\nAnd I wanna actually be able to show you\nthat this is what has to happen as well.\n\n52\n00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.430\nSo there's a couple of\nways where we can do this.\n\n53\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.462\nAnd what we're taking a look at,\nof course, is the easy way first.\n\n54\n00:03:02.462 --> 00:03:06.390\nWe're gonna take a look at Office 365 and,\nof course, the Admin console, and\n\n55\n00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.010\nshow you how to distribute\nthose roles out.\n\n56\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.460\nAnd then we're also gonna\ntake a look at PowerShell and\n\n57\n00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.960\nessentially show you the same\nthing about how to manage it,\n\n58\n00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.790\nof course, through using PowerShell\ncommands to help us out as well.\n\n59\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.870\nSo that is what we're actually moving\nto be able to do and understand, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.830\nSo as we get started here, let's go ahead\nand take a look at our Office 365 portal.\n\n61\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.870\nAnd if we are now just starting,\nlet's say that our\n\n62\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.380\npilot is now ready to get on its way,\nand we've got our E3 plan going here.\n\n63\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.800\nI'm gonna click on that little button,\nand then the Admin tile there.\n\n64\n00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.310\nAnd once I have that button,\nnow I need to go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.688\nassign different roles to,\nwell, certain users.\n\n66\n00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:54.150\nSo I'm gonna click inside the Users Group\nand then select Active Users.\n\n67\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.118\nInside of Active Users then, okay,\n\n68\n00:03:56.118 --> 00:03:59.043\nI need to actually do some\nof the administration role.\n\n69\n00:03:59.043 --> 00:04:04.737\nSo if I select Daniel here, over on the\nright-hand side I also have the ability,\n\n70\n00:04:04.737 --> 00:04:08.280\nof course, to edit his role or\neven his user role.\n\n71\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.990\nSo let me go ahead and\nselect EDIT USER ROLES..\n\n72\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.610\nAnd let's see what user\nroles that we have, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.620\nRight now currently,\n\n74\n00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.300\nbecause I just created Daniel's account,\nhe has no administrative access at all.\n\n75\n00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.339\nI could make him a global\nadministrator as well.\n\n76\n00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:27.962\nAnd that would actually allow him to be\nable to control everything in the same way\n\n77\n00:04:27.962 --> 00:04:32.890\nthat I do, as being the one who created\nthis actual tenancy inside of Office 365.\n\n78\n00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.090\nBut if I want to assign\nhim to a particular role,\n\n79\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.310\nI can then select Customize administrator.\n\n80\n00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.710\nAnd it's right here that we have\nthe ability to actually assign\n\n81\n00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.330\nDaniel either one or\nall of these services, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.060\nSo it does make sense, the logical way\nthat they've actually separated this out.\n\n83\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.490\nAnd we'll see some of them are actually\nkinda stuck behind my head here.\n\n84\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.740\nBut notice that there's actually\nthe Billing administrator,\n\n85\n00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.530\nthis is exactly like it sounds.\n\n86\n00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.680\nThe very fact is, if you're the billing\nadministrator, it means that look,\n\n87\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.240\nhere's what's gonna happen here.\n\n88\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.590\nIs that if we purchase something,\n\n89\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.890\nwell it should go through\nDaniel at this point, right.\n\n90\n00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.430\nSo Daniel says oh, we need access\nto the Exchange Online Protection?\n\n91\n00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.590\nSure thing, we go and add it in and\n\n92\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.160\nDaniel's the one that will\nactually get the bill.\n\n93\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.880\nNo, he won't get it personally, but he'll\nget an email that notifies him of that,\n\n94\n00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.090\nbut he'll be the one that's\nauthorized to do that.\n\n95\n00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.090\nSo what does that mean for me?\n\n96\n00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.656\nThat means for me as a user, though,\nif I'm just a regular user inside of that\n\n97\n00:05:27.656 --> 00:05:32.036\nbusiness, I don't just get to go and\nsearch through all those programs.\n\n98\n00:05:32.036 --> 00:05:34.458\nAnd maybe the Admin console\nstill pops up for them, but\n\n99\n00:05:34.458 --> 00:05:36.270\nthey don't get to see anything.\n\n100\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.680\nBut if they actually do go ahead and\n\n101\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.920\nclick on like, Purchase This,\nit doesn't mean that they get to do so.\n\n102\n00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.560\nSo you have that Billing administrator.\n\n103\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.939\nThe Exchange administrator, again,\nalso makes sense for the email and\n\n104\n00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.251\nactually running their mail server.\n\n105\n00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:52.819\nAnd then there's, I know that it\nseems kind of silly, at least for\n\n106\n00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.898\nme, you go, Password administrator,\nare you joking?\n\n107\n00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:58.280\nOne person actually just\nmanaging passwords?\n\n108\n00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.163\n>> Probably the most utilized\nguy in the company, right?\n\n109\n00:06:00.163 --> 00:06:02.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I messed up my password again,\n\n110\n00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.445\nI can't remember it,\ncan you reset that for me?\n\n111\n00:06:05.445 --> 00:06:07.449\nThat dude is just, everybody and\n\n112\n00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:12.160\ntheir brother coming at him with\na password change, a very busy person.\n\n113\n00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.801\n>> Very much so and it's kind of strange\nbut, yes they realize that that's probably\n\n114\n00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:18.089\ngonna be one of the more over,\nI say over utilized.\n\n115\n00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:21.392\nBut probably the busiest type of\nadministrator that we're gonna end up\n\n116\n00:06:21.392 --> 00:06:23.659\nhaving cuz people will\nforget their passwords.\n\n117\n00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.467\nAnd there's Skype for Business, those of\nus that actually are using things like\n\n118\n00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:31.060\nphone system and teleconferencing,\nthere's Skype for Business.\n\n119\n00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.050\nService administrators are handling,\nof course, individual users and\n\n120\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.650\ntheir way of accessing in what they need.\n\n121\n00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.340\nThen there's SharePoint,\nof course, for collaboration.\n\n122\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.670\nAnd then there's also other user\nmanagement services as well.\n\n123\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.030\nSo there's different services that run\nin the background, that, of course,\n\n124\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.010\nwill actually be there.\n\n125\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.970\nAnd then users, of course,\nwill handle creating user accounts,\n\n126\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.750\ndeleting user accounts, you name it.\n\n127\n00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.730\nSo there's different\nways that we can do that.\n\n128\n00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.690\n>> So Ronnie, with these\nadministrator roles that we have\n\n129\n00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.340\nthat we're looking at right here.\n\n130\n00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.550\nReally what we're doing is we're saying,\nbased on the job that I give you,\n\n131\n00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.020\nso if you're a building administrator,\nor you're a password administrator.\n\n132\n00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.340\nBased on that job role, you have\na certain level of permissions and\n\n133\n00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.198\nabilities to do certain\nthings inside of Office 365.\n\n134\n00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:15.884\nThis seems to be a departure from the\ntraditional model where we would create\n\n135\n00:07:15.884 --> 00:07:19.760\na group, put somebody in that group, and\nthen we get rights assigned that way.\n\n136\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.890\nEven though it's similar,\nto me it seems like the difference here\n\n137\n00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.780\nis the fact that when we created a group,\nit could be anything.\n\n138\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.340\nWe could create a group called A, and\nA can mean anything we want it to be.\n\n139\n00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.890\nIt could just be a random letter or\ncontainer for\n\n140\n00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.770\nus to put people in or user accounts in.\n\n141\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.309\nHere, it's very specific, it's saying\nevery role, which is really a group,\n\n142\n00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:45.409\nanother word for a group, they all\nhave a specific meaning behind them.\n\n143\n00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:47.024\nAnd that meaning gives\nthem those permissions.\n\n144\n00:07:47.024 --> 00:07:49.210\n>> Yeah, that's the way to look at it.\n\n145\n00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.177\nThat's why it is a big departure from\nthe way that we would normally do\n\n146\n00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:52.954\nthings, right?\n\n147\n00:07:52.954 --> 00:07:56.764\nSo it does kinda turn it on its head\na little bit in that sense of saying hey,\n\n148\n00:07:56.764 --> 00:07:59.536\nhere's people I want to\nactually be able to do these.\n\n149\n00:07:59.536 --> 00:08:03.215\nYou actually assign those people you\nwanna do that group of stuff instead.\n\n150\n00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:06.500\nSo it does turn it\na little bit around there.\n\n151\n00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.980\nBut it's really important that we\nunderstand how this is done and it's,\n\n152\n00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.250\nyou notice it's like a, hey, Ronnie,\nthat doesn't seem challenging at all.\n\n153\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.100\nBut it is one of the things\nthat we have to be able to do.\n\n154\n00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.280\nOf course, then when it comes\ndown to the exam itself,\n\n155\n00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.168\nwhat are the chances that it.s\ngonna be this easy, not so much.\n\n156\n00:08:26.168 --> 00:08:31.547\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, a lot of times it's not\nthat easy when it comes down to the exam\n\n157\n00:08:31.547 --> 00:08:36.847\nand that's because for one reason or\nanother, there's an affinity towards\n\n158\n00:08:36.847 --> 00:08:41.764\npower shell that Microsoft Office\n365 here, loves to be able to do.\n\n159\n00:08:41.764 --> 00:08:42.887\nBut that's-\n>> It's a drug they are hooked on, sir.\n\n160\n00:08:42.887 --> 00:08:44.203\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n161\n00:08:44.203 --> 00:08:48.393\nthere is that unusual way that they seem\nto be able to do stuff like that, and\n\n162\n00:08:48.393 --> 00:08:53.049\nthey always are able to relate it back to\nPowerShell, and that's perfectly fine,\n\n163\n00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:55.580\nthat they want you to be able to do here.\n\n164\n00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.120\nOkay, so administrator or\npermission roles will do stuff like that,\n\n165\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.820\nright there inside of the portal.\n\n166\n00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:09.260\nSo when we start talking\nthen about moving to and\n\n167\n00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.390\ntrying to determine some different things\nhere, we wanna to make sure you know how\n\n168\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.480\nto do this in the PowerShell as well,\nand we also want to talk about one other\n\n169\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.000\nthing, which is what we call\na delegated administrator too.\n\n170\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.870\nAnd we'll get back to that after we\ndo the PowerShell stuff as well.\n\n171\n00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.240\nSo let me go back over here, and\nI'll just minimize my portal and\n\n172\n00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.500\nthen we will get started on the idea\nof the PowerShell stuff too.\n\n173\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.060\nSo remember that when we are doing this,\nI'm gonna use that same Azure active\n\n174\n00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:43.700\ndirectory module for Windows PowerShell\nto get us to do what we need to.\n\n175\n00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.860\nWhat we need to do is we need to verify,\n\n176\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.740\nwe need to verify that those roles that\nwe just typed in really do exist, and\n\n177\n00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.320\nthis is a little bit of a tedious nature,\ntype of thing that has to be done.\n\n178\n00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.870\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do is define\nthis variable that I'm gonna call role\n\n179\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:02.650\nhere, and I need to be able\nto get the actual role name,\n\n180\n00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.510\nso there's a msolrole,\nis what I'm gonna do.\n\n181\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.360\nAnd then, what is the role\nname that I'm looking for?\n\n182\n00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.870\nSo what is this about?\n\n183\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.428\nWhat if I actually need to determine\nwho is actually gonna be, let's say for\n\n184\n00:10:15.428 --> 00:10:17.387\nan example, my billing administrator.\n\n185\n00:10:19.596 --> 00:10:22.995\nAll right, so I need to determine\nmy billing administrator.\n\n186\n00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:25.385\nI'm telling it hey,\nI'm gonna use this $role,\n\n187\n00:10:25.385 --> 00:10:30.055\ntell it to get the role and of course,\nthat RoleName Billing Administrator.\n\n188\n00:10:30.055 --> 00:10:31.295\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n189\n00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:37.930\nSo that has actually come first and then,\nI can actually retrieve this information.\n\n190\n00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.286\nSo msorole and\nthen rolemember is what I need.\n\n191\n00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:47.700\nGet dash nsorolemember, and\n\n192\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.600\nthen I do a dash roleobjectID, and\n\n193\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.330\nnow I can call upon that\nlittle variable here for us.\n\n194\n00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:04.742\nWhich is role, if I typed it in correctly,\n\n195\n00:11:04.742 --> 00:11:11.530\ndot ObjectID.\n\n196\n00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:16.450\nAnd now when I do so, I'll get this\nverification that what you see here\n\n197\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:21.670\nis both of these users, are actually\npart of that billing administrator.\n\n198\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.790\nI'm actually in that group because I'm\nthe global admin and Daniel now is\n\n199\n00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:30.510\nalso in that group, because we just made\nhim the billing administrator as well.\n\n200\n00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.570\nAnd you can see that both of these\nare actually licensed accounts, and\n\n201\n00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.540\nthat means in Office 365, Daniel gets\naccess to Office 365 And so do I.\n\n202\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.920\nSo it gives us that nice ability to be\nable to see it even from right here.\n\n203\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.690\nSo that way, if I need to say hey, we need\nto remove Daniel from this, we simply can.\n\n204\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.650\nInstead of adding him, we'd simply type\nin the word remove right there and\n\n205\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.160\nhe would be that.\n\n206\n00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160\nNow, let's see if it\nactually makes a change.\n\n207\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.730\nInside of well the Office portal to.\n\n208\n00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:04.970\nSo in the Office portal here, let's see if\nI go and find Daniel's account and then,\n\n209\n00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:12.000\nI select edit rolled users here and you\nsee now there it is it actually did check\n\n210\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.290\nhim as being the billing administrator,\nlet me cancel this out here.\n\n211\n00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:20.110\nAnd I believe,\nI also added Mike in as a user as well.\n\n212\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.280\nAnd you can see that here it is,\nMike's also was checked.\n\n213\n00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.120\nSo we're essentially doing the same thing,\nwhere what I did at the very beginning,\n\n214\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.990\nright, is I would've put\na check mark right here, and\n\n215\n00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.060\nthen being able to see it\nactually verifies it as well.\n\n216\n00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.260\nInside of PowerShell we\nessentially can do the same thing.\n\n217\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.290\nSo remember that we need to get\nconnected to that service first.\n\n218\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.730\nAnd then be able to run those accounts,\n\n219\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.690\nwhere we can add in these\nparticular service roles.\n\n220\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.380\nNow, we're not completely done with\naccounts yet, we still have to deal with\n\n221\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.610\nusers and groups but\nthat's coming up in a later episode.\n\n222\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.480\nThat we are going to be dealing with, but\n\n223\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.210\nat least at the beginning here when\nwe talk about assigning different\n\n224\n00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.860\nadministrator roles, we can actually\ndo it right here inside of our.\n\n225\n00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.860\nOn the console as well as\ninside PowerShell, too.\n\n226\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.230\nSo, that's actually fairly easy.\n\n227\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.259\nNow, one of the tasks though, okay, and\n\n228\n00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:12.060\nwe wanna get to this one because this\none is the one that will kill us.\n\n229\n00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.840\nWe talked about and\n\n230\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.870\nwe made fun of password\nadministrator just briefly, right?\n\n231\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.430\nWell, you can imagine in organizations,\nespecially when people are beginning\n\n232\n00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.934\nthe on boarding process, if there is a\ntime when people are going to forget their\n\n233\n00:13:23.934 --> 00:13:28.100\npasswords, it's gonna be right then and\nthere if you actually assigned them.\n\n234\n00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.595\nSo what about with Office 365?\n\n235\n00:13:30.595 --> 00:13:34.001\nThis is easy enough, when you're\nactually inside of the building,\n\n236\n00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:38.540\nyou can actually call whoever the password\nadministrator is, your supervisor.\n\n237\n00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.010\nAnd they'll be upset, oh yeah,\nI just reset your password.\n\n238\n00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.930\nBut what if this is actually where, again,\n\n239\n00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.360\nlet's say that Daniel is actually out on\na business trip for us, and he's now out\n\n240\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.630\nsomewhere where he's only got that phone\ncall, and he needs that password reset.\n\n241\n00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:58.270\nHe's got access to the internet, well\ndoes he call back, does he ever do that?\n\n242\n00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.170\nIf he is as perfectly fine but\nnow it gets crackly over his phone line,\n\n243\n00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:06.600\nhe don't hear what the words are,\nit becomes a little bit more treacherous\n\n244\n00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.160\nas he starts to try and retype in wrong\npasswords and locks him out again,\n\n245\n00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.780\nbecause he doesn't wait 20 minutes for\nhe can come back again.\n\n246\n00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.570\nYou name it, there's a lot of\ndifferent things that can go on.\n\n247\n00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.440\nWell Microsoft has actually\nthought about this that, hey,\n\n248\n00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.230\nwe can make this easier and\nalso make it more secure.\n\n249\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.200\nJust like anything else online right,\n\n250\n00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.980\nyou shouldn't be using easy passwords like\npassword, you shouldn't be using 123456.\n\n251\n00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.580\nSo what does Microsoft\nactually do is that,\n\n252\n00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.060\nthey give you the ability to come in and.\n\n253\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.660\nChange your own password, right?\n\n254\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.720\nSo sometimes you forget,\nso let's say that.\n\n255\n00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.160\nOh, I'm trying to see if I can log\nout here, is what I want to do.\n\n256\n00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.700\nGet back into the log out page,\nand we'll do that.\n\n257\n00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.630\nThere we go.\n\n258\n00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.080\nSo let's say that you're right here,\nand then you get to this point where,\n\n259\n00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.070\nyou can't access you're account because\nyou can't remember your password.\n\n260\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.790\nWell, the good thing is they have\nthis link directly underneath,\n\n261\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.640\nevery single user that actually gets\naccess to your Office 365 account is.\n\n262\n00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.050\nAnd then you can click access,\nthat you can't access the account.\n\n263\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.240\nSo notice it actually sends\nyou to this generic page.\n\n264\n00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.380\nNow, you can actually take the link that's\nup here without all of the additional\n\n265\n00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.090\nkind of little things after the first one.\n\n266\n00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.510\nBut it's\npasswordreset.microsoftonline.com.\n\n267\n00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.980\nIf you can get access to that,\nall you have to do at this point,\n\n268\n00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.580\nI'm not gonna do it for mine right here.\n\n269\n00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.300\nBut all you have to do is type in your\nuser name, your user ID, which is\n\n270\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:41.220\ntypically gonna be your mail address, and\nthen, to verify that you're not a robot,\n\n271\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.960\nyou have to do this kind of CAPTCHA\nthing or whatever this is called now.\n\n272\n00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.570\nI always get these things wrong here,\nDaniel.\n\n273\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.000\nThe numbers that absolutely look\nlike numbers but they really aren't.\n\n274\n00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.417\nYou have to type all that in.\n\n275\n00:15:53.417 --> 00:15:57.132\nOnce you get that, then it will\nregenerate a password and email you.\n\n276\n00:15:57.132 --> 00:15:57.792\nNow.\n\n277\n00:15:57.792 --> 00:16:01.857\nWhen it actually emails you,\nit will email you a password but\n\n278\n00:16:01.857 --> 00:16:05.640\nonly after you confirm by one of two ways,\nright?\n\n279\n00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.810\nYou'll either get a text message on\nyour phone or they can call you.\n\n280\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.870\nSo they are not just gonna send an email\nout and just assume that it's done here.\n\n281\n00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.100\nBut you absolutely have to verify.\n\n282\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.030\nSo you'll get two different\ncodes is what will happen.\n\n283\n00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.490\nFirst time when you do this,\nyou'll have to enter in another code,\n\n284\n00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.140\nand it will tell you where to\nenter in that second code, and\n\n285\n00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.370\nthen the second time you actually get\nthat email that will actually say,\n\n286\n00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:31.270\nhere is your newly generated password,\nand then you'll log in again.\n\n287\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.000\nSo they really have stepped up\nwhat we call that two factor, or\n\n288\n00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.520\nthat second factor authentication,\nwhatever you want to call it here, so that\n\n289\n00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.850\nyou really aren't actually just getting\nan email to some generic account here.\n\n290\n00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.360\nIt's something that you have\nto be able to login to, but\n\n291\n00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.780\nthen you have to verify that it's you\nrequesting it and not some robot.\n\n292\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.890\nSo really a safe way to do this, and the\nnice thing is as password administrator,\n\n293\n00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.010\nmakes your job relatively easier.\n\n294\n00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.070\n>> That's right,\nget some of that business off my plate, so\n\n295\n00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.640\nthat I can do more important things.\n\n296\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.870\nNot that resetting\npasswords isn't important,\n\n297\n00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.310\npeople need to have access to\ntheir systems, to their emails,\n\n298\n00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.340\nto whatever it is that's inside of Office\n365, or any system for that matter.\n\n299\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.110\nBut, being able to where I\ndon't have to do it for them.\n\n300\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.700\nThey have a system that will\nenable them to help themselves\n\n301\n00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.220\nis a nice feature of Office 365.\n\n302\n00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.130\nRonnie, you got anything else for us?\n\n303\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.760\n>> I have one other thing that I want to\nmake sure that we also get to because I\n\n304\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.090\ndid forget, dash,\nyou mentioned this before.\n\n305\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:30.500\nThat inside of Office 365, there's\na chance that you're gonna come across\n\n306\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:38.370\nusers that don't want the latest edition\nof Office 365 working on their machine.\n\n307\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.120\nNow I don't think you'll come across\nthat too often but it is possible.\n\n308\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.540\nSomebody that really is right there and.\n\n309\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.005\nAnd ready and waiting.\n\n310\n00:17:47.005 --> 00:17:50.242\nBut, then you also have\nthe person that says,\n\n311\n00:17:50.242 --> 00:17:54.476\nI love my Office 2010 or\nmy Office 2013 or 2007.\n\n312\n00:17:54.476 --> 00:17:56.018\nWhatever it is.\n\n313\n00:17:56.018 --> 00:17:59.632\nBut everybody is switching\nover to Office 365 and\n\n314\n00:17:59.632 --> 00:18:05.500\nyou still have that user sitting there\nlike, it's not actually ever gonnachange.\n\n315\n00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.800\nAnd not ever gonna matter.\n\n316\n00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.540\nSo what we wanna do, though,\n\n317\n00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.200\nis actually let you know that you\ncan still help that user out.\n\n318\n00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.310\nThey can still be sort of\nintegrated in with Office 365,\n\n319\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:21.290\neven though they're actually working with\nan older edition of Office as well, okay?\n\n320\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.720\nSo let me show you how to do that.\n\n321\n00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.170\nSo here it is, I'm on my machine,\nI'm signing back into Office 365,\n\n322\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.790\nso I'm at the portal.\n\n323\n00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:31.180\nAnd what I want to do here, let me go\nback to the actual beginning here.\n\n324\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.570\nOops, I kicked myself out,\nI am lying to you.\n\n325\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:39.476\nPaste in the password and\nthen I will sign in again.\n\n326\n00:18:42.226 --> 00:18:46.586\nNow, if this is us, if this is the user,\nwhat we can actually do, so\n\n327\n00:18:46.586 --> 00:18:51.328\nhere it is, we can go to the little\ngear up here to access the settings, and\n\n328\n00:18:51.328 --> 00:18:56.146\nthen the Office 365, and so this is for\nthat user that really is not gonna\n\n329\n00:18:56.146 --> 00:19:00.700\nsay that he's gonna switch on over\nto what he needs to be doing.\n\n330\n00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.340\nAnd then make sure we're all on the\nSettings over here on the left hand side.\n\n331\n00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.601\nAnd then when you select software.\n\n332\n00:19:08.891 --> 00:19:12.935\nYou can actually go here and\nthis will give you of course,\n\n333\n00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:18.412\nthat latest edition so, mine actually\nsays it's the Office 365 plus with\n\n334\n00:19:18.412 --> 00:19:25.030\n2013 apps as we have them, and then from\nthat point, I can go to desktop setup.\n\n335\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.560\nOkay, so in the desktop setup here.\n\n336\n00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.280\nIf you already have office 2010 or\n\n337\n00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.210\n2007 installed on your computer,\nokay, then it will help you to\n\n338\n00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:41.227\nactually make that part of that\nmanagement package in Office 365.\n\n339\n00:19:41.227 --> 00:19:45.780\nSo, you actually have that\nability to do that as well.\n\n340\n00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.700\nSo if I click setup,\nI don't actually have either one.\n\n341\n00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.740\nBut, it will actually make those\nconnections that it needs to, to verify\n\n342\n00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.820\nand run through that set up, since I\ndon't have it, I'm not gonna run it here.\n\n343\n00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.730\nBut, if you do have some I access,\nlook, I don't think I need to switch,\n\n344\n00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.310\nI don't think I wanna switch, and you\nreally need to make that accommodation for\n\n345\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.970\nthat user, then, here's how you\nhave to make that accommodation.\n\n346\n00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.000\nBut, if you don't.\n\n347\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.935\nYou just go well, you're switching [LAUGH]\nand a lot of times you need to, right?\n\n348\n00:20:10.935 --> 00:20:15.038\nIf you're still running\nOffice 2007 in 2015 or\n\n349\n00:20:15.038 --> 00:20:18.590\n2016, I'm not making fun of the product.\n\n350\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:24.130\nBut you gotta remember that that is now 7,\n8 year old code and\n\n351\n00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.070\nit doesn't matter how much that they\npatch it, it's still 8 years old.\n\n352\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.290\nThat probably means that\nit's older than the machine\n\n353\n00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.804\nthat you're actually running on and\nthat means that the coding is that way.\n\n354\n00:20:34.804 --> 00:20:38.410\nSome 14 year old kid in\nthe Asian Pacific region is\n\n355\n00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:42.100\neating it like he's eating his cereal and\nbeing able to break that code.\n\n356\n00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.510\nAnd I really mean that.\n\n357\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:48.420\nRemember that if you do need to make\nan allowance for somebody that's\n\n358\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.780\nstill on the Office 2007, 2010, Office\n365 gives you that ability to do so,\n\n359\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.430\nto take of that without them\nreally having to upgrade.\n\n360\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.180\nNow, hopefully later on they will.\n\n361\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.090\nBut the very fact is,\nif that person's been there forever, and\n\n362\n00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.900\neven been there longer than you,\nsaying I'm keeping it, here's your way,\n\n363\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.610\nto make sure they are also\npart of that office plan.\n\n364\n00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.740\n>> That's right.\nSometimes it's hard to teach an old dog\n\n365\n00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.690\nnew tricks, but eventually,\nthey will come around.\n\n366\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.760\nThey'll see the light.\n\n367\n00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.176\nOr they'll be gone.\n[LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:21:15.176 --> 00:21:15.676\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n369\n00:21:15.676 --> 00:21:16.640\n>> All right, Ronnie, thank you so much.\n\n370\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.700\nWas there anything\n\n371\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.940\nelse that you wanted to cover before\nwe closed the show for today?\n\n372\n00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.530\n>> Not really.\n\n373\n00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.430\nThe very fact is that hey, there's\nsome things that are fairly simple,\n\n374\n00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.340\njust like we talked about, and\nthey're even intuitive, right?\n\n375\n00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.880\nWe understand the need to distribute these\nroles, we understand the need to do it.\n\n376\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.310\nI don't understand the need to\ndo it through PowerShell but\n\n377\n00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.230\nwe do need to know how to do it.\n\n378\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.840\nAnd a lot of times,\n\n379\n00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.550\nit does help especially if\nyou're scripting it out right.\n\n380\n00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.560\nIt does, let's say that you have 10 or\n\n381\n00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.070\n15 people that you're actually\nsaying it's gonna be an admin.\n\n382\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.290\nWell, yeah, I can say, Daniel,\ngo ahead and you click on each one,\n\n383\n00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.180\nand you select this administrator,\nand you do that for\n\n384\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.960\nall 15 people, or I can just say Daniel,\nlet's create a script for this and\n\n385\n00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.450\nrun it through PowerShell and\nit's done like that.\n\n386\n00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.720\nSo there is a great need for PowerShell.\n\n387\n00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.470\nThose of us who aren't great at typing,\nthat's me, that's what I'm talking about.\n\n388\n00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.900\nNot so much the concern,\nbut it is about efficiency,\n\n389\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.372\nit's about doing things once and\nthat's why we like it.\n\n390\n00:22:12.372 --> 00:22:14.890\n>> All right, thank you much for\nthat Ronnie and thank you guys for\n\n391\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:15.460\nwatching today.\n\n392\n00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.460\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n393\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.610\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n394\n00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.309\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n>> And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.310\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.630\nin today's episode we are continuing\ndown that train track.\n\n5\n00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.280\nThat is managing Office 365 identities and\nrequirements.\n\n6\n00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.010\n>> Very good.\n>> Joining me in the show today is my good\n\n7\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.115\nfriend and, thank you for\nthe kudos on getting that right.\n\n8\n00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:31.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.025\nWelcome to the show Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:33.025 --> 00:00:37.446\n>> It's a great day to be right here as\ncontinue to take a look at Office 365 and\n\n11\n00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:41.400\nwe're now moving into just\na slightly different direction.\n\n12\n00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.940\nWhat we're going to talking about what\nmore of the password management things we\n\n13\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.860\nneed to do, and\nalso of course creating users.\n\n14\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.880\nNow we spent a lot of time focusing in\non just kind of the overview, right?\n\n15\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.960\nCreating a pilot plan, making sure that we\nunderstand some of the complexities here,\n\n16\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.420\nbut now as we get into some of the nitty\ngritty things in which we're ready.\n\n17\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.890\nWe've decided that it's now time for\nus to switch on over.\n\n18\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.070\nWe've also take and look at of course\ncreating different types of administrator,\n\n19\n00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.590\nrole based administrators,\ndoing some rights management but\n\n20\n00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.470\nnow we're getting into creating users,\nwe're actually making sure there\n\n21\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.890\nare password policies or\nwhat we also need them be.\n\n22\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.440\nNow, this can be something\nthat can be complex and\n\n23\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.760\nthe reason why is that if you're already\nin an organization, and you have\n\n24\n00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.700\nan incredibly complex password policy,\nyou may find out that those particular\n\n25\n00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.350\nrequirements may not fit exactly\nthe way that you need to in Office 365.\n\n26\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.420\nSo you do have to actually kind of\nmake sure that there's a fit for\n\n27\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.620\nwhat you actually need to happen, and\nthat will also come into play a little\n\n28\n00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.950\nbit later on as we get into things\nlike active directory synchronization.\n\n29\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.060\nand federation services as well.\n\n30\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.381\nBut the very fact is that most of the time\nthe complexity requirements inside of\n\n31\n00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:56.719\nOffice 365 and the password\npolicies are going to help and\n\n32\n00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.083\nmatch up to your domain\na lot of times here.\n\n33\n00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:01.020\nSo you don't have to\nworry about it too much.\n\n34\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.660\nBut we do need to see where we actually go\nin and manage those things and, of course,\n\n35\n00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.020\nwe also need to see that what we'll end up\nfinding out here is that sometimes, things\n\n36\n00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.820\nare not gonna be done inside of that GUI\ninterface, but also with PowerShell.\n\n37\n00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.120\nAnd the same will be true as we\nalso manage users or identities.\n\n38\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.780\nNow, Microsoft doesn't like to call\nout the idea of just users, but\n\n39\n00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.500\nthey always call it the idea of identities\neven though inside of Power Shell,\n\n40\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.250\nwe'll see we're specifically\nreferring to users as well.\n\n41\n00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.450\nSo we'll see how to do that too.\n\n42\n00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.580\nSo this show is actually packed with\nthe idea of managing, of course,\n\n43\n00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.200\nthen, users and passwords is what\nwe're really focusing in on.\n\n44\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.260\nSo let's go ahead and\ntalk about that a little bit.\n\n45\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.399\nOkay?\nSo, normally when we first set up,\n\n46\n00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.532\nlet's say, our first domain,\nin which we're in charge of.\n\n47\n00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:49.385\nA lot of times, one of the first things\nwe had to do in terms of our passwords\n\n48\n00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:53.680\nis to try and get users to\nactually not use simple passwords.\n\n49\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.934\nWe've even seen in the last several years\na trend even on the internet that there's\n\n50\n00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:01.700\nalways some kind of security firm that\nbreaks down at the end of the year and\n\n51\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.188\nsays, here's the most popularly\nused passwords on the internet.\n\n52\n00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:10.303\nAnd when you take a look at them,\nthey're insanely easy passwords,\n\n53\n00:03:10.303 --> 00:03:14.278\nsuch as the word password itself,\nor 123456.\n\n54\n00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:17.680\nNow that can be found on like 80% of\npasswords that are actually used out on\n\n55\n00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.870\nthe Internet.\n\n56\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.320\nWell those are things that Microsoft says,\nlook, we really don't want that to happen.\n\n57\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.020\nSo by default, they already set out\nthe idea of a complexity level,\n\n58\n00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.770\nin terms of the passwords.\n\n59\n00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.790\nSo that way as a default user,\nyou actually end up doing that.\n\n60\n00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.280\nMicrosoft Office 365 will go ahead and\ncreate a simple but\n\n61\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.920\nshort I should say, not simple,\na short password for\n\n62\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.800\nyou that's also going to be a little\nmore complex at the very beginning.\n\n63\n00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.300\nAnd we also need to see about the policy\nand the expiration dates too and\n\n64\n00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.440\nwhere to control those.\n\n65\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.950\nSo when it comes down\nto managing passwords,\n\n66\n00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.540\nusually that's what we're\nreally talking about, right?\n\n67\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.970\nIs the idea of the length and the\ncomplexity, as well as the expiration and\n\n68\n00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.650\nthe duration.\n\n69\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.560\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, it's funny.\n\n70\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.360\nYou mention that they put these lists out\nof commonly used passwords every year,\n\n71\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.050\nI just looked up to 2015.\n\n72\n00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.070\nI'm looking at the 20 most\ncommon used passwords in 2015.\n\n73\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.258\nNumber one, one, two,\nthree, four, five, six.\n\n74\n00:04:13.258 --> 00:04:13.990\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> Okay,\n\n75\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.460\nthis is commonly used password into the,\nas of 2015, right.\n\n76\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.820\nThe word password is number two, one,\ntwo, three, four, five, one, two, three,\n\n77\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.670\nfour, football, qwerty, princess,\nsolo, log in, welcome, we're seeing.\n\n78\n00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.750\nSome real glaring weaknesses\nwhen it comes to this.\n\n79\n00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.710\nAnd the fact that these\nare common passwords,\n\n80\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.840\nwell that should be ringing\nbells off with you.\n\n81\n00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.160\nSo when we do recommend\nhow to set a password,\n\n82\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.710\nwe've got some guidelines that you\nprobably need to follow with that.\n\n83\n00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.190\nBut then we just gotta figure how\ndo we actually do this inside of\n\n84\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.980\nOffice 365 right.\n\n85\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.270\n>> That's definitely true that we have to\nworry about that particular setting as\n\n86\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.160\nwell so\n\n87\n00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.900\nwe may end up where at the very beginning\nwe're working with two passwords.\n\n88\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.330\nOne the complexity level and\n\n89\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.300\nall of the stuff that we have to\ndeal with inside of our domain.\n\n90\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.690\nBut then remember that we're actually\nlogging in maybe for the first time as\n\n91\n00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.760\nan Office 365 user and they already have\na default policy kind of set in place\n\n92\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.050\nthat you can tweak and massage, but\nyou have to know how to do that.\n\n93\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.680\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat how we set that up right here in\n\n94\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.120\nthe beginning, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.530\nSo here it is, I'm on my machine, and\n\n96\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.310\nI'm simply gonna go to\nthe Office portal for right now.\n\n97\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.790\nAnd I've already logged on just a few\nminutes before our show as we began,\n\n98\n00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.049\nand then I need to go to this little\nbutton over here on the left-hand side,\n\n99\n00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:32.270\nand click on the admin tile for\nus, and that will of course,\n\n100\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.890\nget us into the Office 365 Admin Center.\n\n101\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.920\nWhen we started dealing with passwords and\n\n102\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.570\nsome of the policies that are in place,\nthey are not right out there at\n\n103\n00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.850\nthe forefront of of having\na list of just passwords.\n\n104\n00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.010\nSo as you look over in\nthat navigation bar,\n\n105\n00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.520\nthey're not actually just there\nwhere it says password management,\n\n106\n00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.520\nand that's something that I would expect\nto see, but they don't do it that way.\n\n107\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.380\nWe have to click on users.\n\n108\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.030\nInside of users,\nwe can go to active users, and\n\n109\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.880\nit's here that we can actually\nmanage the passwords Individually,\n\n110\n00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.520\none account at a time, if we actually\nwant to do something like this.\n\n111\n00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.210\nNow, when we take a look there's\na couple of things that we've\n\n112\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.620\nalso looked at in a previous episode.\n\n113\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.080\nBut let me point them out as well.\n\n114\n00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.500\nSo let's say here I select\nDaniel as my test case here.\n\n115\n00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.758\nAnd then over on the right-hand\nside you can see the properties for\n\n116\n00:06:24.758 --> 00:06:29.398\nDaniel's account and at least one of\nthe password policies is right here\n\n117\n00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:32.460\nwhere I can have him reset the password.\n\n118\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.730\nAnd I select this notice that\nI can actually go ahead and\n\n119\n00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.400\nsend the results of the e-mail to me or\nI can even sign on and\n\n120\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.230\nsay make this person change their\npassword next time they sign in.\n\n121\n00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.090\nNow, when I do that, right?\n\n122\n00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.740\nIf I just do this part, and I don't\nmake them change the password next time,\n\n123\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.540\nI click reset.\n\n124\n00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.570\nWhat that's gonna end up doing is it's\ngonna give me now his user name, and\n\n125\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.040\nthere is that complex\npassword that it gives me.\n\n126\n00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.970\nNow that's a little bit small,\n\n127\n00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.400\nI don't know if I can zoom that in\na little bit more so that we can see it.\n\n128\n00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.190\nBut let me see if I can try here.\n\n129\n00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.230\nOh there we go yeah that\nactually zooms in pretty good.\n\n130\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.680\nSo there it is so\n\n131\n00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.690\nthere's Daniel and then this one is\na generated password by Microsoft.\n\n132\n00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.400\nNotice this is eight characters,\nhas capitals, lower cases and\n\n133\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.940\nof course a combination of numbers there,\n\n134\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.300\nif we wanted to be able to\ndo something like that.\n\n135\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.830\nNow by being able to do\nsomething like that.\n\n136\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.070\nThat is just one of the policies that we\ncan set right here on the admin console.\n\n137\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.520\nSeems to be pretty good if we need to.\n\n138\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.790\nBut Daniel,\njust by looking at this though okay,\n\n139\n00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.135\nthere is no place that you can see,\nat least I hope not.\n\n140\n00:07:35.135 --> 00:07:36.614\nThat I can tell right now,\n\n141\n00:07:36.614 --> 00:07:40.053\nis a place to change what\nthe actual password expiration is.\n\n142\n00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:42.793\nDo you know what the default\nexpiration is for the password?\n\n143\n00:07:42.793 --> 00:07:46.328\n>> I have no clue, and you're right,\nI don't really see anything at least off\n\n144\n00:07:46.328 --> 00:07:49.075\nhand that says here's where\nto set password policy.\n\n145\n00:07:49.075 --> 00:07:52.921\n>> Right, and so\nit's not exactly hidden but it is small.\n\n146\n00:07:52.921 --> 00:07:57.712\nIt's tiny and when I mean tiny it's right\nup here in this little grouping here.\n\n147\n00:07:57.712 --> 00:07:59.005\nLet me zoom in again.\n\n148\n00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:01.689\nI don't want to keep zooming in and\nout too much, but\n\n149\n00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:04.800\nwe do have to do a little\nbit of zooming in and out.\n\n150\n00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.390\nNow let me go ahead and\nshow you right here.\n\n151\n00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.220\nChange the password expiration policy for\nyour users.\n\n152\n00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.940\nNow when we do that, right,\nit's actually that all or nothing.\n\n153\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.990\nAnd notice right here,\n\n154\n00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:21.040\nto set the password expiration policy,\nI have multiple choices.\n\n155\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.605\nI can set all of the passwords inside\nof my Office 365 to never expire.\n\n156\n00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:30.550\nIt makes perfectly good sense if I really\ndon't want that to happen, but Daniel,\n\n157\n00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.630\nthe chances of us wanting to do\nthat inside of our own domain,\n\n158\n00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.830\nbetter yet an Internet account,\nwhat do you think?\n\n159\n00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:36.730\n>> Yeah slim to none\n\n160\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.500\nespecially when it comes to people\nthat are actually logging in.\n\n161\n00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.320\nWe're talking service accounts and\nthings of that nature, and\n\n162\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.960\nif you've ever dealt with active\ndirectory type of environment.\n\n163\n00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.150\nThose do occur, but\nhere in Office 365 we're thinking\n\n164\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.870\nof people that are actually going\nto be using the system, logging in.\n\n165\n00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.390\nThey should be logging in\nif they have an account.\n\n166\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.220\nIf they're not what's the purpose\nof the account to be around, Ronny?\n\n167\n00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.520\n>> Right, yeah, so those are some of\nthe unusual things that we also have here.\n\n168\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.406\nWhere we can do that.\n\n169\n00:09:03.406 --> 00:09:06.980\nSo, here it says, \"Manage how frequently\nthe password will expire\" and\n\n170\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.540\nwe're primary gonna set it to not expire.\n\n171\n00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.540\nAnd then,\ndays before the password expires,\n\n172\n00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.970\nnotice this one,\nthis one's set pretty generously,\n\n173\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.570\nto 90 days from whenever that\naccount was initially created, and\n\n174\n00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.610\nthen of course, it starts all over once\nthey actually have to set a new password.\n\n175\n00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.090\nSo this one's set to do it\njust about every three months,\n\n176\n00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.690\nthat's a pretty generous time period,\nright?\n\n177\n00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.850\n>> Yeah, that's a long time.\n\n178\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.140\nNormally, you're looking at between 30 and\n\n179\n00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.050\n45 days, this is the average time\nthat most administrators set for\n\n180\n00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.690\ntheir passwords to expire because well,\nthat's about as long as it would take\n\n181\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.820\nan average password to be cracked if it's\nshort enough and not complex enough.\n\n182\n00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.890\nSo, if that is the case then by the time\nsomeone does crack it they're changing\n\n183\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.610\ntheir password and mitigated the fallout.\n\n184\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.960\n>> Yeah, and even though they set\nit at 90 you can set this one\n\n185\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.170\nas short as 14 days but\nas long as 730 days.\n\n186\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.920\nI wanna make sure I told you right.\n\n187\n00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.800\nSo that's about two years or\nso, maybe a little bit longer,\n\n188\n00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.120\nsix, yeah, somewhere around there.\n\n189\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.770\nIf you wanted to,\nif if somebody asked you,\n\n190\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.790\nthey had a password that they\nreally loved, you could set it for\n\n191\n00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.120\nabout two years if you needed to,\nor to never expire.\n\n192\n00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.190\nNow of course you also can give\na notification right about two weeks out\n\n193\n00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.760\nbefore that.\n\n194\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.440\nAnd so you simply change it\nhere to what you want to do.\n\n195\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.630\nSo let's just say, but I set it for\nabout six weeks here, and\n\n196\n00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.550\nthat's still pretty generous but\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n197\n00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.730\nAnd then I can go ahead and\n\n198\n00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:32.020\nsay we're gonna give a notice of about\nseven days before the expiration happens.\n\n199\n00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.080\nAnd so if I go ahead and click save there,\nthat will now actually give\n\n200\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.000\nme that new password policy that\nwill be set for all of my users.\n\n201\n00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.260\nNow, what happens when that\nnew password policy is set and\n\n202\n00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.808\nwe start coming to that seven days before.\n\n203\n00:10:45.808 --> 00:10:48.890\nWell, what will happen is up here,\nyou'll see this little bell, and\n\n204\n00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.740\nthat's where your notifications are,\nand I have a notification,\n\n205\n00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.890\nit's not my password notification, it's\ntelling me I need to purchase this is what\n\n206\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.670\nit's telling me before I lose any data.\n\n207\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.620\nBut you actually get notifications right\nhere that will tell you, \"Hey, your\n\n208\n00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.410\npassword's about to expire, and do you\nwanna go ahead and change it now?\" Okay.\n\n209\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.250\nSo when you do something like that you'll\nend up getting another menu at that point.\n\n210\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.630\nThat will actually tell you hey look\nhere's what needs to be done and\n\n211\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.558\nyou need to change this.\n\n212\n00:11:14.558 --> 00:11:17.330\nThe default ,right if\nI remember correctly,\n\n213\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.710\nis between eight and the maximum number\nof characters when I first set up my own,\n\n214\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.800\nOffice 365 account was 14.\n\n215\n00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.980\nBut people have been complaining about\nthe short length of that password,\n\n216\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.890\nand they've been wondering why that they\nlimit it to 14, so it could be even now,\n\n217\n00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:37.850\nbecause it's been probably about a year or\nso since I've set up my own Office 365\n\n218\n00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:42.030\nthat that password policy may have\nchanged where you can now actually have\n\n219\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.510\nmore characters, and\nI'm not going to guarantee you that.\n\n220\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.440\nBut at least some point, you'll need to\npay attention, and the reason why you\n\n221\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.600\nwant to pay attention to that,\nis that users that are used to using what,\n\n222\n00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.640\nlonger passwords, I know Daniel,\nI think he says his is 24 characters or\n\n223\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.750\nso, longer passwords, all of a sudden\nsomebody says oh no, I'm going to use\n\n224\n00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:03.630\nmy standard default 24 character password\nthat nobody is ever going to figure out\n\n225\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.550\nSounds perfectly great until you\ntry to enter it into Office 365 and\n\n226\n00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.360\nit tells you 14 characters is going\nto be the max that you have to do.\n\n227\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.820\nSo just kind of realize that you may\nnot be able to actually extend it\n\n228\n00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.280\nto everything that you'd hope it to be.\n\n229\n00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.700\nSo what they do recommend and\nthis is just a hint on the side,\n\n230\n00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.360\nright, if you think that you are going to\nbe migrating your active directory into\n\n231\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.530\nOffice 365 and that address stuff,\nthey recommend that if you take a look,\n\n232\n00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:36.120\nmake sure you know what those,\nwhat the Azure policy is, right?\n\n233\n00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.500\nAnd make sure you start aligning when your\ninternal passwords to do the same thing.\n\n234\n00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.441\nSo it may be that you find out,\nI don't want to say it's more complex, but\n\n235\n00:12:45.441 --> 00:12:49.319\nit doesn't quite match up to what Azure\nactually says it needs to be, and\n\n236\n00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:53.326\nthat's probably gonna the easier way\nto change that than to change Azure to\n\n237\n00:12:53.326 --> 00:12:56.870\nmatch up to what your current\npassword policy is gonna be.\n\n238\n00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.760\nSo that is a recommendation\nfrom Office 365 itself,\n\n239\n00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.340\nif you are gonna be matching up with that,\nokay?\n\n240\n00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.540\nSo that actually sounds like something\nthat is fairly easy for us to do.\n\n241\n00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.879\nSo the good thing is, even though we know\nthat there's a couple of things that we\n\n242\n00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:15.990\ncan do here, we know that we can\nchange our password expiration policy,\n\n243\n00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.900\nwe know that we can\nreset the users password\n\n244\n00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.760\nright here from the admin console,\nwe showed you how to do that.\n\n245\n00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.170\nBut there's also something else that\nwe also need to take a look at too,\n\n246\n00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.460\nwhich is the idea of password complexity.\n\n247\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.214\nNow, when we take a look in\nthe admin console, there is nothing,\n\n248\n00:13:38.214 --> 00:13:41.730\nthere's not even a hint of how you\nwould actually manipulate that or\n\n249\n00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.670\nchange that at all, and\nthat is because there is only an on or\n\n250\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:50.840\noff setting for password complexity and\nit's on by default.\n\n251\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.200\nSo if that makes sense,\nwhat do you know then?\n\n252\n00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.840\nIt let's you know something that,\n\n253\n00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.450\nhey Microsoft really wants\nyou to use complex passwords.\n\n254\n00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:03.910\nThey don't expect to make it easy for\nyou to turn that stuff off.\n\n255\n00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.190\nBut is there a way you can turn it off?\n\n256\n00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.140\nYou better believe it, there's always\na way that you can turn it off.\n\n257\n00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.800\nIf you're willing to deal with\nit through the Power Shell and\n\n258\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.090\nbe able to connect in Office 365,\nusing Power Shell to do it.\n\n259\n00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.938\nSo again, it's not the most\ndifficult thing in the world, but\n\n260\n00:14:19.938 --> 00:14:21.980\nit is something that you need to consider.\n\n261\n00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.420\nIf for one reason or another you wanna\nactually make it where you're excluding\n\n262\n00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.390\nthings like the complexity level.\n\n263\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.390\nPerfectly fine.\n\n264\n00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.010\nYou can do that.\n\n265\n00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.890\nDoes Microsoft or\nOffice 365 ever recommend that?\n\n266\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.520\nNo.\nDid they actually publish it out there to\n\n267\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.250\nwhere it'd be super easy for you to find,\noh yeah just simply change this?\n\n268\n00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.050\nNo, they really don't\nwant you to change it.\n\n269\n00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.380\nBut they will allow you to change it\nbecause, well, it is actually something\n\n270\n00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.210\nthat you purchased, and so\nthat's what it will also effect.\n\n271\n00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.520\nSo let's go ahead and do that too.\n\n272\n00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.100\nNow because we don't have any setting or\njust a check box, which is what I would\n\n273\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.390\nhope for, it means we have to deal\nwith it through the Power Shell.\n\n274\n00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.660\nSo let me go ahead and bring up my\nWindows Azure Active Directory module for\n\n275\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.710\nPowerShell.\n\n276\n00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.780\nAnd the first thing that I\nneed to do is go ahead and\n\n277\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.740\nconnect to the actual service.\n\n278\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:16.510\nAll right, so I need to just connect into\nMicrosoft online, so I'm gonna connect,\n\n279\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.190\nand then msolservice, if I can spell it.\n\n280\n00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.160\nI'm going to do a verbose command.\n\n281\n00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.788\nAnd when I do so that should give me of\ncourse the credentials I need to pop in\n\n282\n00:15:28.788 --> 00:15:29.842\nfor my account.\n\n283\n00:15:34.049 --> 00:15:38.770\nAnd then I will pace my password\nin here if it's actually saved.\n\n284\n00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.660\nAnd correct I shouldn't get any errors,\nand\n\n285\n00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.170\nit should just give me the next line in.\n\n286\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.013\nA lot of times, if I try and\ntype in my complex password,\n\n287\n00:15:46.013 --> 00:15:48.629\nit's never going to actually happen for\nthe show.\n\n288\n00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:52.047\nSo at least I copied it and\nwas actually able to save it here.\n\n289\n00:15:52.047 --> 00:15:57.689\nNow whenever we do this, we want to also\ntake a look at the idea here of our users,\n\n290\n00:15:57.689 --> 00:16:02.510\nAnd also, the complexity requirements\nthat we also have here too.\n\n291\n00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:08.080\nSo if I type in a get-msoluser and\n\n292\n00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:14.300\nthen I pipe that into select,\nthe userprincipal name.\n\n293\n00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.000\nAnd I should just do my tabs here,\nbut I can't of course.\n\n294\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.050\nPrincipal name, I have to make\nsure I spell that correctly.\n\n295\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:31.268\nThen I'm going to type in dash,\nlet me see,\n\n296\n00:16:31.268 --> 00:16:39.606\nmaybe it's actually just\nthe strongpasswordpolicy, or required.\n\n297\n00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:45.200\nThere we go, okay.\n\n298\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.860\nSo right now you can actually\ntake a look here and\n\n299\n00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.200\nI've just done this simple select\ncommand as what I've done right?\n\n300\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.550\nSo you actually know\nlittle bit about this,\n\n301\n00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.420\nI told that to get the username, right?\n\n302\n00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.640\nAnd there it is select the principal name,\nand then also show me whether or\n\n303\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.270\nnot it actually requires\na strong password.\n\n304\n00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.570\nAnd right here you can see where, well,\n\n305\n00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.490\nall of these actually have\nrequired a strong password.\n\n306\n00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.320\nI've got one that does not, okay.\n\n307\n00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.740\nSo at this point here if I needed to\nactually change that particular user's\n\n308\n00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.200\npassword complexity I can.\n\n309\n00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.570\nNow, remember when we set the actual\npassword expiration, right?\n\n310\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:23.760\nWhere we,\nwhen we did that it actually did it for\n\n311\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.350\neverybody, okay, but notice this Daniel.\n\n312\n00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.650\nThis one,\nit actually allows me to be very granular.\n\n313\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.300\nIn the very fact I can set, Daniel,\n\n314\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.160\nyour account to actually\nhave password complexity.\n\n315\n00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.050\nBut maybe somebody like me that typing\nis a challenge more than anything else.\n\n316\n00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.290\nMaybe I might need to set his\nto Not Password Complexity.\n\n317\n00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:47.302\nSo it's kinda strange, but yet it is kinda\nneat where, at one point, you don't want\n\n318\n00:17:47.302 --> 00:17:50.873\neverybody to have different sets of\nwhen their passwords are gonna expire,\n\n319\n00:17:50.873 --> 00:17:52.460\nyou want to single policy there.\n\n320\n00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.711\nBut here it may be specifically for\nthat, that you do have users that go,\n\n321\n00:17:56.711 --> 00:18:01.242\nno, there's no way that they're ever\ngoing to get this upper, lower case,\n\n322\n00:18:01.242 --> 00:18:06.490\nstrange characters, numbers, and all that\nand it's going to be 10 characters long.\n\n323\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.440\nThey're never going to remember that.\n\n324\n00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.750\nThen you walk by their desk and\n\n325\n00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:14.330\nthey have it pasted it to their\nscreen with a little Post-It note.\n\n326\n00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.180\nSo you may actually be able to do this.\n\n327\n00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.670\nSo it's kind of neat that they give\nyou the ability, so best practice?\n\n328\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.750\nNever.\n\n329\n00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.900\nIt is not a best practice.\n\n330\n00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.570\nBut it is something that you may\nhave to make an allowance for.\n\n331\n00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:27.590\nSo let's go in and\n\n332\n00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:32.740\nshow you the command that we need to do\nto change the complexity if we want to.\n\n333\n00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:37.279\nSo at this point here we can also do this.\n\n334\n00:18:37.279 --> 00:18:42.371\nSo if I go ahead and\ndo the same thing here, get-msol,\n\n335\n00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:48.130\noops, see I get a little bit too fast for\nwhat I want to do.\n\n336\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.970\nAnd I just don't type in enough.\n\n337\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.850\nMsolUser, and\nat this point I want to go ahead and\n\n338\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:59.330\nset up what the actual\npassword is going to be.\n\n339\n00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:08.820\nSo when I do this,\nI can do set-MsolUser and\n\n340\n00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.040\nnow I need to define that user here.\n\n341\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:18.821\nSo that user is going to be the Username\nhere, Userprincipalname, excuse me.\n\n342\n00:19:18.821 --> 00:19:22.399\nUserprincipalname and then,\n\n343\n00:19:22.399 --> 00:19:27.770\nwe'll do this for let's see, we'll do Dan.\n\n344\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:34.034\nSo, we'll see if we can change\n\n345\n00:19:34.034 --> 00:19:38.463\nDaniel's here, .com, and\n\n346\n00:19:38.463 --> 00:19:44.680\nthen I type in StrongPasswordRequired.\n\n347\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.133\nNow, we're not done yet,\nwe know that default and\n\n348\n00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:48.740\nDaniel is actually set this way.\n\n349\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.080\nIf I want to changes I simply\ntype in a dollar sign.\n\n350\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.330\nAnd I type in the world false,\nand let's see,\n\n351\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:02.110\nit's not the user principle name\nit's looking for is the key here.\n\n352\n00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.890\nDid I misspell it?\n\n353\n00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.610\nI've actually obviously gotten an error\nhere a couple of different times here and\n\n354\n00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.980\nI figured out exactly what\nactually is wrong here.\n\n355\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.480\nAnd it's this pipe command that\nI actually ended up doing.\n\n356\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.850\nSo what happens is,\nthat even though it likes me to be able\n\n357\n00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.970\nto get some of the information, it doesn't\nwant me to set it up in the same way.\n\n358\n00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.490\nSo what I can do now is I\ncan actually just get rid of\n\n359\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.680\nthat get which is just\ngetting the information back.\n\n360\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.986\nAnd now I'm simply gonna set that user and\nthe UserPrincipalName here.\n\n361\n00:20:33.986 --> 00:20:38.412\nOh I need to type that back in,\nso I was kind of\n\n362\n00:20:38.412 --> 00:20:43.559\na little bit farther,\nUserPrincipalName here and\n\n363\n00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:48.130\nthen the StrongPasswordRequired is false.\n\n364\n00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.540\nSo now when we take a look at that,\nit actually did work.\n\n365\n00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.070\nSo sometimes you get a little bit\nexuberant like I do, you go okay, it'd be\n\n366\n00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:59.800\nnice to actually return the information\nand then to go ahead and do the command\n\n367\n00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.730\nsetting that up, but in this particular\ncommand it just didn't like that.\n\n368\n00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.690\nIt saw it as something else\nit didn't want to do, so\n\n369\n00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:11.517\nnow if I go backward here, and let's\nsee if I can actually get, never mind,\n\n370\n00:21:11.517 --> 00:21:14.530\nlet's just go ahead and do what we\nwere doing a little bit earlier here.\n\n371\n00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.935\nSo I'm gonna do a select again and\nthen this one is gonna be\n\n372\n00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:26.240\nUserPrincipalName and then do a comma,\n\n373\n00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:35.760\nand this one was StrongPasswordRequired\nand now we can see, there it is.\n\n374\n00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.802\nMike and Daniel's account now\nare also set defaults for\n\n375\n00:21:39.802 --> 00:21:43.140\nthat StrongPasswordRequired, okay?\n\n376\n00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.350\nNow, there is also that ability for\nyou to do this as well,\n\n377\n00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.540\nyou can change even the password\nexpiration as far setting.\n\n378\n00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.470\nAn individual's user account password and\nnot expire.\n\n379\n00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.060\nBut you can't do it as a default\npolicy where you can go\n\n380\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.740\nI want this to be 19 days,\nand this one to be 24 days.\n\n381\n00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.080\nBut you can if you need it to.\n\n382\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.810\nSo if I need to make sure that Daniel's\npassword expired every 30 days, but\n\n383\n00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.930\neverybody else to expire every 42 days,\nwe can do that.\n\n384\n00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.190\nSo we can make one off settings and\n\n385\n00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:16.980\ncustomize what we need right here\nin terms of those passwords.\n\n386\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.830\nBut is it a general\nthing that we should do?\n\n387\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.100\nProbably not.\n\n388\n00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.930\nIs it something that you\nmight find you have to do?\n\n389\n00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:24.600\nYeah.\n\n390\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.330\nSo just kinda realize that\nexceptions do end up happening.\n\n391\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.170\nAnd they do give you the ability to\nset those exceptions in place for\n\n392\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.540\nthose passwords.\n\n393\n00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.710\nSo just kind of setting that\nup is something that we do\n\n394\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.998\nwant to make sure that we point out for\nourselves here.\n\n395\n00:22:40.998 --> 00:22:45.590\n>> And now Ronnie, does this one off kinda\nthing where we're looking at setting\n\n396\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:50.250\nthe password complexity to being on or\ntrue or false for individual users.\n\n397\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:56.020\nIs that the only way it works, or can you\nset it for a bulk users or even a group?\n\n398\n00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.830\n>> Yeah, you can set it for a bulk user or\n\n399\n00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.940\na group as well to make sure that\nthe password complexity is on.\n\n400\n00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:08.320\nSo normally when you do that,\ninstead of using the principal name,\n\n401\n00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:15.010\nlet me bring up that command again\nthat I used with your name Daniel.\n\n402\n00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.590\nSo messy now,\nlet me just clear the screen here.\n\n403\n00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:24.829\nSo instead what we would normally\nend up doing here is we would\n\n404\n00:23:24.829 --> 00:23:31.140\nset the msoluser and\n\n405\n00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.010\ninstead of actually designating a UPN,\nthe UserPrincipalName,\n\n406\n00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:39.430\nat this point here we would go ahead and\ninstead do this.\n\n407\n00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:44.337\nWe would type in StrongPasswordRequired.\n\n408\n00:23:44.337 --> 00:23:48.083\nAnd then we would do like a,\ninstead true if we wanted to and\n\n409\n00:23:48.083 --> 00:23:53.052\nin theory if unless I've typed it in wrong\nwhich is a very good possibility and\n\n410\n00:23:53.052 --> 00:23:56.504\nyou'll actually see where\nit requires an object ID.\n\n411\n00:23:56.504 --> 00:23:59.708\nSo this one doesn't allow me to do it for\nevery single one but\n\n412\n00:23:59.708 --> 00:24:04.003\nif I had created a group More than likely,\nI could actually create that group and\n\n413\n00:24:04.003 --> 00:24:05.879\nhave that object id tied in there.\n\n414\n00:24:05.879 --> 00:24:07.019\nThat would allow me to do this.\n\n415\n00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:09.750\nI just don't have any groups created for\nus to do that.\n\n416\n00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:14.400\nSo, I can't do an all or\nnothing in terms of the password\n\n417\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.470\nrequirement in the way that\nI have it set up right now.\n\n418\n00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.040\nBut if I could create that object which is\ngonna be a group name that will give me\n\n419\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.340\nan object id, then yes,\nI would be able to do so.\n\n420\n00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.400\nOr that user principle name is\nactually gonna be the way to go.\n\n421\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.570\nBut they're really\ndesiring it at this point,\n\n422\n00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.010\nto really just be an individual\nas much as possible.\n\n423\n00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.060\nBut in theory it is possible.\n\n424\n00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.702\n>> Awesome.\nWell,\n\n425\n00:24:35.702 --> 00:24:39.114\nI guess the other thing we were thinking\nabout when it comes to passwords is, well,\n\n426\n00:24:39.114 --> 00:24:40.284\npeople tend to forget them,\n\n427\n00:24:40.284 --> 00:24:43.343\nor for whatever reason they're not\ntyping their password in correctly.\n\n428\n00:24:43.343 --> 00:24:47.435\nAnd they give up, abandon all hope,\nand they're gonna call somebody and\n\n429\n00:24:47.435 --> 00:24:49.980\nsay I need to reset my password.\n\n430\n00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.240\nI have to get logged in.\n\n431\n00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.340\nThat's probably one of the main\nduties of any type of administrator,\n\n432\n00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.480\nis password resets.\n\n433\n00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.590\nRight?\n>> There's no doubt that password resets\n\n434\n00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:01.520\nare the way to go and the nice thing\nis Microsoft already has a built in\n\n435\n00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.550\ndefault way that we can also\ntake a look at this too.\n\n436\n00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:09.160\nNow, the easiest way for a user of course,\nif they call me to set it up.\n\n437\n00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.980\nIs the way that I've showed you right\nhere at the beginning of the show.\n\n438\n00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.429\nWhere if I'm actually the one being\ncalled, I simply select their name and\n\n439\n00:25:16.429 --> 00:25:17.257\nI can reset this.\n\n440\n00:25:17.257 --> 00:25:19.013\nBut the way that you can do it,\n\n441\n00:25:19.013 --> 00:25:23.036\nif they're actually getting\nproblems where they can't login is.\n\n442\n00:25:23.036 --> 00:25:24.159\nLet me sign back out and\n\n443\n00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:27.006\nsee if it actually brings me\nback to that login page here.\n\n444\n00:25:27.006 --> 00:25:28.810\nIs now that I'm signed out.\n\n445\n00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.960\nLet me see if I can get back in now.\n\n446\n00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.150\nAnd go to my portal.\n\n447\n00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.570\nAnd it's right here that\nif I select my portal.\n\n448\n00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.970\nTrying to do it without logging in here.\n\n449\n00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.100\nOf course it's not gonna\nlet me do it here.\n\n450\n00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.280\nLet me.\nA lot of times\n\n451\n00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.450\nwhen you do get to that page.\n\n452\n00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.040\nThere it is.\n\n453\n00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.650\nI just had to click on it.\n\n454\n00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.640\nWhen I do forget my password.\n\n455\n00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.720\nWhat you want is right here where it\nsays you can't access your account.\n\n456\n00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.290\nAnd once I select that, and\nI select work or school account,\n\n457\n00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:05.460\nthere is this which is\nthe passwordreset.microsoftonline site.\n\n458\n00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.670\nAnd when it does this, you simply enter in\nthe username that you have for Office 365.\n\n459\n00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:13.150\nAnd actually, Daniel, on this one I don't\nthink I could actually tell what the heck\n\n460\n00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.790\nthat one is actually gonna be.\n\n461\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:15.770\n>> It's a garbled mess there.\n\n462\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:16.442\n>> That one is a garbled mess.\n\n463\n00:26:16.442 --> 00:26:19.461\nBut it does require you to do that\nto prove that you're not a robot.\n\n464\n00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:21.133\nAnd even after you do that,\n\n465\n00:26:21.133 --> 00:26:24.750\nyou still have at least one\nmore thing that has to be done.\n\n466\n00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:29.150\nYou have to actually make sure that\nthe email address it sends, whatever it\n\n467\n00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:34.190\nsends to you, is actually the valid\nemail address of course that they have.\n\n468\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.498\nAnd then they're gonna require you to do\na second factor authentication as well.\n\n469\n00:26:38.498 --> 00:26:42.100\nNormally that's either gonna be\na phone call to you or an email,\n\n470\n00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.650\nnot an email, a text message to that\nphone number that you also list\n\n471\n00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.200\nthat will be able to\nreceive text messages.\n\n472\n00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.330\nAnd that's just Microsoft being\nincredibly safe in this day and age.\n\n473\n00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.090\nBecause they just want to verify that it's\nyou, that it's not somebody that's stolen\n\n474\n00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.110\nyour password and\nthen it is able to get access directly in.\n\n475\n00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.890\nA lot of people might think\nthat this is it, right?\n\n476\n00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:03.740\nSo here it is.\nThey're on,\n\n477\n00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.640\nthey log in, portal.office.com.\n\n478\n00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.500\nAnd then they just simply click on the\nreset the password and they send an email.\n\n479\n00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.440\nAnd remember email\naddresses can be spoofed.\n\n480\n00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.750\nAnd so instead,\nthey actually require this second factor.\n\n481\n00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.643\nAnd hopefully because of the number\nthat's already stored in Microsoft.\n\n482\n00:27:20.643 --> 00:27:24.412\nAt that point when you actually\ndo create that account,\n\n483\n00:27:24.412 --> 00:27:27.730\nyou should be able to\nenter in that text number.\n\n484\n00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.930\nThen that validates and sends you to that\npage where you gonna reset your password,\n\n485\n00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:32.953\nis what is gonna do.\n\n486\n00:27:32.953 --> 00:27:35.229\nSo, password management.\n\n487\n00:27:35.229 --> 00:27:38.330\nNot insanely difficult.\n\n488\n00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.633\nBut if you do need to\ncustomize the passwords,\n\n489\n00:27:40.633 --> 00:27:43.005\nmaybe learning a little\nbit of the PowerShell.\n\n490\n00:27:43.005 --> 00:27:44.364\nAnd there's three or four commands.\n\n491\n00:27:44.364 --> 00:27:48.000\nBut easy enough to do,\nbut it's hard to remember.\n\n492\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.050\nBut do pay attention, especially if\nyou're getting ready for the exam.\n\n493\n00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.830\nThese are the types of questions\nthat they love to throw at you.\n\n494\n00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.690\nLike which of the following will\nhelp you reset the password, or\n\n495\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.000\nnot reset the password, but to do that.\n\n496\n00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.760\nTo do some of these things here,\nthe password expiration, the complexity.\n\n497\n00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.670\nKnowing those things\nare really gonna help you out.\n\n498\n00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:06.664\n>> Awesome.\nWell Ronnie,\n\n499\n00:28:06.664 --> 00:28:09.121\nI know we have a whole lot\nmore that we need to go over.\n\n500\n00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:12.115\nWell I'm looking at the clock and\ntime has expired for us here, so\n\n501\n00:28:12.115 --> 00:28:15.280\nI guess were gonna have to do another\npart two, for this good series.\n\n502\n00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.150\n>> Sounds like a good idea.\n\n503\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.220\n>> Its great stuff,\nthis is the meat and potatoes.\n\n504\n00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.150\nI look forward to seeing\nthere on that show.\n\n505\n00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.090\nI thank you guys for watching this show.\n\n506\n00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:23.012\nRonnie does as well.\n\n507\n00:28:23.012 --> 00:28:25.569\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign for\non this episode from ITProTV.\n\n508\n00:28:25.569 --> 00:28:27.087\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n509\n00:28:27.087 --> 00:28:27.796\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n510\n00:28:27.796 --> 00:28:29.004\n>> And we'll

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:18.118\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:22.470\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with our Microsoft Office 365.\n\n6\n00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.700\nWell, those lovely requirements and\n\n7\n00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.290\nidentities that they have available for\nyou.\n\n8\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.670\nI should have flipped that around,\nbut you get the idea.\n\n9\n00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.390\nJoining us in the studio yet again today\nto lend his expertise on that topic\n\n10\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.507\nis none other than my good friend,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:34.507 --> 00:00:35.891\nRonnie, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:36.710\nHow you doing today, sir?\n\n13\n00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.290\nI'm doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.170\nIt's a great day to be right here\nas we continue to take a look at\n\n15\n00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.300\nmore of Office 365.\n\n16\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.980\nIn previous episodes,\nwe've actually done a lot with Office 365.\n\n17\n00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.600\nWe are now moving into\nthe realm of managing users.\n\n18\n00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.950\nNow, it's actually fairly simple.\n\n19\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.600\nWe've shown you how to create users\nbefore in a previous episode.\n\n20\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.050\nIndividual and single users,\nas we have that.\n\n21\n00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.290\nBut that actually works in the pilot,\nright?\n\n22\n00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.069\nWhen you're first setting up your pilot,\nthere you are,\n\n23\n00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.517\nyou're probably nervous\nabout who to include in.\n\n24\n00:01:05.517 --> 00:01:08.520\nBut once you get that list,\nyou actually can sit down, and\n\n25\n00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.556\nyou might be a little bit slow like I am.\n\n26\n00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:13.802\nYou wanna make sure everything\nis individually in there,\n\n27\n00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:16.662\nthat you answer all\nthe questions that you need to.\n\n28\n00:01:16.662 --> 00:01:18.915\nYou're a little bit timid,\nI guess, trying to go,\n\n29\n00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:21.100\nI just wanna make everything's perfect.\n\n30\n00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.570\nAnd so, you start actually\nentering in one user at a time.\n\n31\n00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.739\nAnd that actually worked for\nus, except for\n\n32\n00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:29.680\nthe very fact that as we\ncontinued to move forward, right?\n\n33\n00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.420\nAnd then we realized that we're\npast that phase of a pilot.\n\n34\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.529\nAnd now we are ready to\nadd in multiple users.\n\n35\n00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.327\nWell now, multiple users,\neven five or ten.\n\n36\n00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:43.170\nYou may go, oh yeah, I'll enter those in\nwhen I get a chance to enter them in.\n\n37\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.486\nBut what if that number, Daniel,\nturns into 25, 30, 100 or maybe 1,000.\n\n38\n00:01:49.486 --> 00:01:51.460\nDaniel, how about that idea?\n\n39\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.375\nEntering in every single user the way\nthat we've done it one line at a time.\n\n40\n00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:58.730\nHow's that sound?\nYeah, that's gonna be awesomely bad idea.\n\n41\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.436\nYou do not wanna do that.\n\n42\n00:02:00.436 --> 00:02:02.974\nLike Ronnie said, you'll probably\nget away with doing that for\n\n43\n00:02:02.974 --> 00:02:03.968\nmaybe five or ten users.\n\n44\n00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:07.259\nAnd to be honest with you,\neven after ten users,\n\n45\n00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.677\nyou are done with doing it that way.\n\n46\n00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:10.682\nIt is monotony.\n\n47\n00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:13.713\nIt is not fun to manually enter.\n\n48\n00:02:13.713 --> 00:02:15.570\nOkay, here's a name, here's duh, duh, duh.\n\n49\n00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.050\nWhen I already have them in the system\nI just wanna say, this system,\n\n50\n00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.130\nmeet the new system.\n\n51\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.750\nI want you guys to start talking.\n\n52\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.480\nAnd you just learn from him,\nsince you're the new guy.\n\n53\n00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.980\nThat's how it should work.\n\n54\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.130\nAnd Ronnie, if I'm not mistaken, we kind\nof have that ability here in Office 365.\n\n55\n00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.730\nYou really do.\n\n56\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.970\nAnd this actually is what makes it easy\nfor us to actually understand how to be\n\n57\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.040\nable to move bulk amount of\nusers into Office 365 as well.\n\n58\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.250\nNow if you've actually dealt with a .csv\nfile, a comma separated values file,\n\n59\n00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.830\nyou actually are gonna feel fairly\ncomfortable in what we're talking about.\n\n60\n00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.260\nNow sometimes you may not have it.\n\n61\n00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.150\nSo we're gonna take it\nfrom that perspective,\n\n62\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.500\nthat you may not have dealt\nwith this type of file before.\n\n63\n00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.060\nIf you have, you're gonna see,\nyou're gonna go yeah,\n\n64\n00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.540\nthat's exactly what I was hoping.\n\n65\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.171\nThat's exactly what I was expecting.\n\n66\n00:03:00.171 --> 00:03:04.529\nSo the people at Office 365 said that's\nexactly how people would do it inside of\n\n67\n00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.767\na regular active directory,\neven new hiring departments.\n\n68\n00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:10.571\nThey don't say oh, here's one name Daniel,\nyou're going to enter on that one in.\n\n69\n00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.347\nAnd then, oh, let me send you\nanother one an hour later and\n\n70\n00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:15.010\nkeep entering in that way.\n\n71\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.250\nMore than likely, what they're gonna do\nis at the end of the day, hopefully it's\n\n72\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.540\nnot the end of the day, they're gonna\nsend Daniel instead a ,csv file.\n\n73\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.100\nThat will allow Daniel to\nactually import in those users\n\n74\n00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.140\ninto Active Directory the way\nthat we actually need them.\n\n75\n00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.090\nWith the fields filled out the way\nthat we need them as well.\n\n76\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.870\nAnd then that will actually give\nus everything that we need.\n\n77\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.690\nAnd so in Office 365,\n\n78\n00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.560\nthey tried to implement things that\nIT professionals are also used to,\n\n79\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.970\nespecially in the the idea of bulk\nadding in information to help us out.\n\n80\n00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.400\nSo it's really that simple.\n\n81\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.870\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you what we're talking about.\n\n82\n00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.272\nAnd that way we'll kinda make it easy\non ourselves to be able to see this.\n\n83\n00:03:54.272 --> 00:03:56.530\nNow if you're not familiar with it,\nthis will be your first time and\n\n84\n00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.498\nthat's fine too.\n\n85\n00:03:57.498 --> 00:04:00.050\nYou actually learn how\nto do it right here.\n\n86\n00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.390\nSo I'm simply gonna pick\nmy name that I have for\n\n87\n00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.730\nmy Office 365 account,\nthe ITProTVDemo.com.\n\n88\n00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.463\nSimply going to sign in.\n\n89\n00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:12.762\nAnd once I do, I need to get, of course,\n\n90\n00:04:12.762 --> 00:04:15.896\nto the Office 365 Admin Center\nis where I need to go.\n\n91\n00:04:15.896 --> 00:04:19.050\nNow don't forget there's\nmultiple ways to get there.\n\n92\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.430\nWe can scroll down a little bit.\n\n93\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.150\nLet me get rid of that notification.\n\n94\n00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.110\nAnd notice I can actually\nselect the Admin from here.\n\n95\n00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.080\nWe can also use this little tile button\nup here in the upper left hand corner.\n\n96\n00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.370\nSo I'll use this one this time.\n\n97\n00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.200\nAnd once we're here,\nnotice the Office 365 Admin Center.\n\n98\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.200\nAnd here's what we were\ntalking about before.\n\n99\n00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.852\nIf I go to users, I can select users and\nthen active users.\n\n100\n00:04:42.852 --> 00:04:46.040\nAnd once I do this, in a moment here,\n\n101\n00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.510\nI should see my list of users\nthat I've already added in.\n\n102\n00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.570\nAnd most of these, if not all of these,\nI've added in one at a time.\n\n103\n00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.680\nDuring this series of shows, I've added\nin several different names for us.\n\n104\n00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.650\nBut now remember what we were talking\nabout here is that once you start\n\n105\n00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.570\nto do this during your pilot, no big deal.\n\n106\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.200\nBut when you actually get ready, and you\nare now ready to do this for, let's say,\n\n107\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.810\nthe majority of your organization or\n\n108\n00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.350\ndepartment in your organization,\nyou may not want to do it this way, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.670\nSo what can we do if I know that I have 5,\n10, maybe 15 names I don't know, and\n\n110\n00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.420\nwe have a handful here, but\nI want to add in more users?\n\n111\n00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.506\nInstead of doing a plus right here,\nwhich gives me a single new user,\n\n112\n00:05:25.506 --> 00:05:27.420\nI can go over to the second icon.\n\n113\n00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.810\nAnd when I hover over it, it's actually\ntwo little people here in the icon.\n\n114\n00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.552\nAnd it's called bulk add.\n\n115\n00:05:32.552 --> 00:05:34.676\nSo they call it the bulk add button.\n\n116\n00:05:34.676 --> 00:05:36.313\nAnd I simply select that.\n\n117\n00:05:36.313 --> 00:05:39.450\nAnd that now brings me into this page.\n\n118\n00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.410\nAnd you'll notice that there are six\nsteps that are gonna be followed through.\n\n119\n00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.150\nThe first thing that it's asking me for\nis to select a csv file.\n\n120\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.630\nThe good thing is this\nmeans in your organization,\n\n121\n00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.980\nif you're good at actually doing this, you\nknow how to export one of these things.\n\n122\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.640\nYou know how to actually be able to get\nthis information the way that you need to.\n\n123\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.820\nSo you're probably gonna\nfollow that step to do so.\n\n124\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.313\nBut what if you don't?\n\n125\n00:06:01.313 --> 00:06:04.485\nSo Daniel, let's take for\nan example that this may be something\n\n126\n00:06:04.485 --> 00:06:07.083\nthat I was just assigned\nas a junior administrator.\n\n127\n00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:10.471\nAnd they're saying look,\nwe need to generate this list for\n\n128\n00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:12.785\npeople to be imported in Office 365.\n\n129\n00:06:12.785 --> 00:06:16.288\nAnd I wanna make sure I include\nin their email address or\n\n130\n00:06:16.288 --> 00:06:18.580\ntheir user principle name, a UPN.\n\n131\n00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.800\nIt looks like an email address.\n\n132\n00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.825\nTechnically it's not,\nbut it looks like one.\n\n133\n00:06:21.825 --> 00:06:27.000\nTheir first name, last name, and\nmaybe even at that point, something else.\n\n134\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.440\nMaybe their department or whatever\nthey're actually a part, or display name.\n\n135\n00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.760\nSo something that simple.\n\n136\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.810\nWell, what if I don't know what I'm doing?\n\n137\n00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.360\nThe nice thing is Office 365 helps us out.\n\n138\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.750\nLet me zoom in just a little\nbit here to help us out.\n\n139\n00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.455\nAnd I'll show you what I'm talking about.\n\n140\n00:06:44.455 --> 00:06:49.239\nSo instead of me just trying to go through\nand figure out what that csv file is,\n\n141\n00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:51.239\nnotice I have two options here.\n\n142\n00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:54.757\nOne is to download a blank csv.\n\n143\n00:06:54.757 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd then secondly,\nit's to download sample csv file.\n\n144\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:03.318\nNow if you are completely 100%,\nyou don't have a clue, okay,\n\n145\n00:07:03.318 --> 00:07:06.684\nyou really do not know what\nit is that you're doing,\n\n146\n00:07:06.684 --> 00:07:10.453\ndownloading the sample csv file\nis probably the way to go.\n\n147\n00:07:10.453 --> 00:07:14.199\nIt will, of course, bring you essentially\na template that you end up seeing.\n\n148\n00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:16.276\nIt'll have some generic names in there.\n\n149\n00:07:16.276 --> 00:07:19.020\nAnd you simply follow that same procedure.\n\n150\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.380\nYou fill in those things that you want to.\n\n151\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.840\nNow normally when you do this,\n\n152\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.070\nthis one's actually gonna be a csv file\nin the format of an Excel csv file.\n\n153\n00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.200\nSo it's looking for\nsome spreadsheet program to open this.\n\n154\n00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.390\nWell, inside of Office 2012 here,\nI don't have a spreadsheet program.\n\n155\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.300\nSo instead I'm gonna select this.\n\n156\n00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.970\nDownload a blank csv file instead.\n\n157\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.420\nAnd when I download that,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n158\n00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.800\nAnd notice it actually has\ngiven me a default name here,\n\n159\n00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.090\nwhich is Import_User_Template.\n\n160\n00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.867\nAnd I'm just going to go ahead and save\nthis, so that we can take a look at it.\n\n161\n00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:56.883\nRight here on my desktop, I've already\ngot a couple of them pre-stage for\n\n162\n00:07:56.883 --> 00:08:00.477\nus, so that we can see how\nOffice 365 helps us out.\n\n163\n00:08:00.477 --> 00:08:02.755\nAnd then here it is.\n\n164\n00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:04.057\nHere's that import user template.\n\n165\n00:08:04.057 --> 00:08:05.897\nAnd if I just open that up,\n\n166\n00:08:05.897 --> 00:08:10.431\nyou end up seeing that it doesn't\nlook like much here, Daniel.\n\n167\n00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:14.010\nIt just looks like a bunch\nof words at the top here.\n\n168\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.100\nLet me change the font size so\nthat we can see it just a tad better here.\n\n169\n00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:23.490\nI'll change it up to 24 so that we,\nlet me put it a little bit less than that.\n\n170\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.250\nGive us a little bit more here.\n\n171\n00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.060\nSo you'll see each of these here\nare also separated by the comma,\n\n172\n00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.400\nwhich is our comma separated value.\n\n173\n00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.860\nSo what I actually have up here is at\nthe top, pretty much just a name, right,\n\n174\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:42.754\nof all the different columns that are\nactually available inside of Office 365.\n\n175\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.950\nSo if everything is actually\nwhere I want them to be,\n\n176\n00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.750\nI simple follow this rule here, okay.\n\n177\n00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:55.480\nWho is the user names, so let's just say\nfor an example this is gonna be Jason and\n\n178\n00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.760\nI'm actually going to\ninstead change this and\n\n179\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.810\nit's gonna be Jason@itproTvdemo.com.\n\n180\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:04.350\nOkay?\n\n181\n00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.030\nSo that's gonna be his\nuser name in Office 365.\n\n182\n00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.900\nIt's the one that I use\nwith my account as well.\n\n183\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.010\nAnd this one, it's gonna be Jason and\nthen Phillips.\n\n184\n00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.480\nAnd at this point his display name,\nwe'll go ahead and give him a display and\n\n185\n00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.306\nsay that it's gonna be.\n\n186\n00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:28.390\nJason Phillips all right now if\nthat is all I need perfectly fine.\n\n187\n00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.930\nOkay I do not have to actually\ninclude in the rest of this if that's\n\n188\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.130\nall I was asked to be able to do.\n\n189\n00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.650\nI can simple then go ahead and\nget rid of the rest of this information.\n\n190\n00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.050\nThen from this point on,\nI just simply continue to follow this.\n\n191\n00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.600\nNow normally when you do this, unlike what\nI did here which is something silly and\n\n192\n00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:52.170\nstupid, it shouldn't actually have any\nspaces here, especially leading spaces.\n\n193\n00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.480\nBut you can actually put them in.\n\n194\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.740\nIf you normally do have spaces you\nmight actually enclose them in\n\n195\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.170\nparentheses like this.\n\n196\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.070\nBut Office 365 really\ndoesn't care that much.\n\n197\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.640\nBut you normally don't want\nany spaces in between.\n\n198\n00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.160\nSo you might want to do that.\n\n199\n00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.460\nAnd then you can continue\nto add these names in.\n\n200\n00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.550\nNow, you're probably saying, well, Ronnie,\nyou're still adding them in one at a time.\n\n201\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.860\nYes, if you do the blank one like this,\nyou're going to.\n\n202\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.820\nBut there's probably people in your\norganization that if you tell them that\n\n203\n00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:21.260\nyou need to actually be able to\nGenerate a CSV file of users that\n\n204\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.260\nare gonna be imported into Office 365,\nand these include in their first name,\n\n205\n00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.720\nlast name, display name,\ndepartment, whatever it might be.\n\n206\n00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.900\nThey can actually help you generate that,\nand\n\n207\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.790\nwhen you do,\nit might come in a couple of formats.\n\n208\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.330\nSo I've already got one pre-staged here.\n\n209\n00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.700\nSo here is the one that I'm actually\ngonna end up using instead.\n\n210\n00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.630\nSo here's a couple of people here, and\nwe'll add in Jason right here instead.\n\n211\n00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.710\nSo let's say that this was\nactually exported for us.\n\n212\n00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:59.110\nAnd let's see, Jason and I did the same\nthing here which I should not have done.\n\n213\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.370\nI keep adding a space because that's what\nI'm used to seeing but I don't need to.\n\n214\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.000\nSo I always do that,\nit's just the way that the eye works here.\n\n215\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.210\nI should add in another L there for\nJason's name.\n\n216\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.740\nShouldn't do that.\n\n217\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.430\nJason Phillips.\n\n218\n00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.570\nAll right and\nlet me get rid of that space again.\n\n219\n00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:30.670\nSee I'm so bad at doing some of this\nstuff and now I'm going to save it.\n\n220\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.210\nNow, I've saved this\nas ITProTV demo users.\n\n221\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.420\nDon't imagine three, imagine hundreds,\nimagine a list of hundreds here.\n\n222\n00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.040\nAnd the more information you fill in\nnow if you use that blank template,\n\n223\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.080\nthe better it's going to be because you\ncan actually append this information and\n\n224\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.030\nwe're gonna be doing that\na little bit later on.\n\n225\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.600\nBut the more that you can fill\nin right at the beginning\n\n226\n00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.200\nmeans the less that you\nhave to do stuff like that.\n\n227\n00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.020\nBut this is just a demonstration for\nus and\n\n228\n00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.360\nthat's why I am just chosing these fields.\n\n229\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.260\nSo anything that you can fill in the rest\nof those columns in that blank one,\n\n230\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.700\nis probably the best way to go, all right?\n\n231\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.760\nSo now that I've saved that, the good\nthing is once I have that done and\n\n232\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.810\nI'm now starting to figure\nout what I need to do here,\n\n233\n00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:16.220\nwell all I have to do is go ahead and\nadd that into this path.\n\n234\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:21.275\nSo I simply click browse, and\nthis one is going to be the ITProTV\n\n235\n00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:25.990\ndemo_users and click there, and so\n\n236\n00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:31.110\nnow that I have that listed, I can\nfollow the steps through, which is next.\n\n237\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.840\nAnd now we'll take a look and see.\n\n238\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.540\nThis is one of the great things, right?\n\n239\n00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.410\nThere's a lot of times I remember,\nthe first time I ever tried to run\n\n240\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.690\nsomething with just a csv,\nyears and years ago.\n\n241\n00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.770\nI thought, this is going to\nwork out great [INAUDIBLE],\n\n242\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:49.090\nit absolutely messed up what I was\ntrying to do because I didn't know.\n\n243\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.180\nThe good thing is in Office 365,\nit verifies.\n\n244\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.830\nDid everything actually translate\nover the way you wanted it to?\n\n245\n00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.610\nUsers that passed verification three,\nI had three in my list which is what I\n\n246\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.740\nwanted to see, and\nthen if I have any errors.\n\n247\n00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.970\nNow if you do end up generating error you\ncan always take a look at the log file and\n\n248\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.280\nthis is what you're looking for.\n\n249\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.900\nRight?\n\n250\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.590\nYou're trying to look and\nsee what is actually strange or\n\n251\n00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.230\nwhat has prevented you from\ndoing what needs to be done.\n\n252\n00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.155\nAnd you see that Office 365\nis ready to accept all these\n\n253\n00:13:19.155 --> 00:13:22.985\nother fields that are out there, if you're\nready to actually have them put in there.\n\n254\n00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:24.795\nSo the more that you put in, the better.\n\n255\n00:13:24.795 --> 00:13:28.694\nBut we left some blank because we do wanna\nshow you [INAUDIBLE] pen some information\n\n256\n00:13:28.694 --> 00:13:32.419\nin, even after you do this instead of\nhaving to generate the whole thing again\n\n257\n00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:33.417\nand do everything.\n\n258\n00:13:33.417 --> 00:13:34.707\nOkay.\n\n259\n00:13:34.707 --> 00:13:35.865\nAll right.\n\n260\n00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:39.714\nSo without any errors,\nnow I go ahead and click next and\n\n261\n00:13:39.714 --> 00:13:42.320\nthen I can select the signin status.\n\n262\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.510\nNow this is actually fairly important.\n\n263\n00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.470\nRight at the beginning, right?\n\n264\n00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.340\nIt's easy to sit there and\ngo alright, so how am I doing this?\n\n265\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.310\nAnd when you take a look at doing\nsomething like this, right.\n\n266\n00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.690\nAnd you have 100 users.\n\n267\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.540\nLet's just say 50, 50 will work for us.\n\n268\n00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.160\nAnd then you go, hey I'm gonna allow\nall this to be signed in immediately.\n\n269\n00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:02.960\nWell they can.\n\n270\n00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.590\nOnce this account is created they\ncan sign right in to Office 365.\n\n271\n00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:11.000\nWell what if you're just setting it up and\nyour not ready for\n\n272\n00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.560\npeople to sign in to Office 365 yet?\n\n273\n00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.920\nWell notice that what you may actually\nchoose to do instead is, go out and\n\n274\n00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.760\nselect blocked instead.\n\n275\n00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.150\nThat way they can't sign in until\nyou're ready for them to sign in.\n\n276\n00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.260\nYou also allow them to sign in right away,\nnormally this type of creation also\n\n277\n00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.720\nautomatically sets up that\nuser license for Office 365.\n\n278\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.570\nAnd that means all those user license.\n\n279\n00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.410\nSo for example,\nI have an E3 account right here.\n\n280\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:44.180\nAnd that normally gives\nme access to 25 licenses.\n\n281\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:49.350\nWell, if I had 50 users Daniel, and I said\nallow them all, all the sudden I may end\n\n282\n00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.880\nup getting errors that say hey you can't\ndo that, there's too many users for this.\n\n283\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.410\nAnd then I can't remember\nwhy is it doing that.\n\n284\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.630\nSo a lot of times it may be where\nall of a sudden you realize,\n\n285\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.420\nI might need to up my account number,\nwhatever might be.\n\n286\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.460\nI need to purchase additional license and\nit should tell us all that information.\n\n287\n00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.650\nBut just kind of realize you may\nactually run into some issues like that\n\n288\n00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.660\nwhen you start taking a look here.\n\n289\n00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.430\nThe other thing that you\nalso may want to consider,\n\n290\n00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:17.480\nespecially if you are a company that\nis beyond a single national boundary or\n\n291\n00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.760\nregion as well, is to select\nthis user location status too.\n\n292\n00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.980\nSo when you do this for bulk users,\n\n293\n00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.430\nyou may wanna generate a separate CSV\nper region or per department, okay.\n\n294\n00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:33.110\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhy is that still so important?\n\n295\n00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.151\nWe know setting up the tenant\naccount was important.\n\n296\n00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:40.048\nBut remember what happens, right,\nis the way Office 365 works is if\n\n297\n00:15:40.048 --> 00:15:43.802\nDaniel is in another region and\nall of a sudden he goes,\n\n298\n00:15:43.802 --> 00:15:48.371\nI can't remember what my password is,\nit also checks the region so\n\n299\n00:15:48.371 --> 00:15:53.537\nit knows how to dial and what numbers\nto dial as well and that's important.\n\n300\n00:15:53.537 --> 00:15:57.689\nIf Daniel happens to be in another country\nit's just dialing the US phone numbers.\n\n301\n00:15:57.689 --> 00:15:59.106\nIt doesn't matter, right?\n\n302\n00:15:59.106 --> 00:16:01.288\nIt's not going to work\nthe way that we need it to.\n\n303\n00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:05.523\nSo you might actually wanna make sure\nthat if you are doing this bulk import,\n\n304\n00:16:05.523 --> 00:16:10.030\nthat you also select the region\nthat's actually appropriate for this.\n\n305\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:14.780\nFor us, all of our people right now\nin our small company's actually\n\n306\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.030\nright here in the United States, so\nI'm gonna select the United States.\n\n307\n00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.670\nAnd so there's also of course licensing\n\n308\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.550\nrestrictions that you may\nneed to pay attention to.\n\n309\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.730\nFrom that point click Next, and\n\n310\n00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.870\nnow notice that 20 of 25\nlicenses are still available.\n\n311\n00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.370\nOops, let me stay on this page for\nright now.\n\n312\n00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.050\nI accidentally clicked.\n\n313\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.330\nAnd this is where you can\ndo a nice other thing.\n\n314\n00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:43.220\nSo you may find out that some users,\nthey do use everything in Office 365.\n\n315\n00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.190\nBut you may find out that some\nof them really aren't gonna be\n\n316\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.060\npart of this Yammer Enterprise group.\n\n317\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.140\nOr they're not gonna be doing doing\nthe Skype for Business Online.\n\n318\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.630\nYou might find that out.\n\n319\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.750\nAnd this does help to\nreduce sometimes the cost\n\n320\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.520\nof everything that you're actually doing.\n\n321\n00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.600\nBut just kinda remember,\n\n322\n00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.250\nit depends on what your organization\nis choosing to do here.\n\n323\n00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.990\nThat way you don't put more on their\ncomputers and they get like, oh what is\n\n324\n00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.100\nthis for and it doesn't work and they're\nkind of confused and frustrated by that.\n\n325\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.320\nSo you have this chance\nwhere you might go and\n\n326\n00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.900\nlook, we're not going to use Sway hear.\n\n327\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.320\nWe're not going to use\nthe like I said here,\n\n328\n00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.140\nthe Skype for Business plan or\nsomething like that.\n\n329\n00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:31.090\nYou may go ahead and do that instead,\nand then I click Next here.\n\n330\n00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.520\nAnd notice it now sends me these\nresults in this email as well.\n\n331\n00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.570\nSo at this point, notice that it's going\nto send me essentially those users, and\n\n332\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:44.310\nit's going to generate a mildly\ncomplex password for them.\n\n333\n00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:49.370\nAnd what I can do once I get that password\ngenerated or that list of passwords,\n\n334\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.360\nI can do an unusual thing which\nis going to be a mailer drive.\n\n335\n00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.420\nSo I can actually take that list\nthat they send me the email in,\n\n336\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.949\nand then I can go into something like\nMicrosoft Office Word, create a form\n\n337\n00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:05.800\nletter telling those users that,\nhey we're about to onboard to Office 365.\n\n338\n00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.740\nAnd we can actually generate it and\n\n339\n00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.100\nset that up to where it says take\nthis user name and this password,\n\n340\n00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:18.410\ngo to this login page and use that\nlogin Office 365 at one point in time.\n\n341\n00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.510\nSo creating that general email\nis actually a good thing for\n\n342\n00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.580\nus if we want to, but, and that's fine.\n\n343\n00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.000\nAnd we'll create that, and\n\n344\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.130\nhere's the results,\nshould show up here in just a moment.\n\n345\n00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.570\nAnd you'll see that\nthat's what it will do.\n\n346\n00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.502\nIt'll create a little table of names for\nus and there we go.\n\n347\n00:18:33.502 --> 00:18:37.090\nWe'll actually have those names and\nthen I click Close.\n\n348\n00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.700\nAt this point I can verify.\n\n349\n00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.095\nSo just as simple as that.\n\n350\n00:18:41.095 --> 00:18:43.080\nOops, now let me see if\nI can click Close again.\n\n351\n00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.646\nI've actually created those users\ninside and you can now see there's the,\n\n352\n00:18:47.646 --> 00:18:52.560\nhere's Angie's name, here's Aaron and\nthere it is, there is Jason now.\n\n353\n00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.590\nWithout me actually having\nto do it one at a time,\n\n354\n00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.070\nthat was actually one of\nthe ways that we can do that.\n\n355\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:03.090\nSo it makes it fairly easy for\nus to be able to handle that and\n\n356\n00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.490\nthen adding in bulk\nusers can be that easy.\n\n357\n00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:10.360\nA lot of times, we're also gonna end\nup seeing where we may not end up,\n\n358\n00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.420\nyou know using the admin console at\nall where we get in the power shell.\n\n359\n00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.075\nWe'll see that in a little\nbit later on too,\n\n360\n00:19:16.075 --> 00:19:19.240\nwhere we can add in bulk users\nusing power shell as well.\n\n361\n00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.490\nBut here's a very easy way if you're\nactually assigned the ability to do that.\n\n362\n00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.770\nNow there is something else of course.\n\n363\n00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.210\nIf we can add users in terms of managing,\nit's something that we do.\n\n364\n00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.270\nWe know that we can add\nthem in individually.\n\n365\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.590\nWe know that we can add them in,\n\n366\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.610\nin bulk, which is actually something\nthat's really good for us.\n\n367\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.350\nAnd we need to pay attention\nto that region as well and\n\n368\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.590\nalso the licenses that we have.\n\n369\n00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.970\nBut when we delete one,\nit's fairly easy too.\n\n370\n00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.860\nSo let me see, who am I gonna delete here?\n\n371\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:53.900\nWe'll just pick on Jason's name since he's\nright here in the studio with us anyways.\n\n372\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.530\nSo if I wanted to delete Jason's account,\nokay.\n\n373\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.190\nFairly easy in terms of managing.\n\n374\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:04.800\nI simply put a check mark here, I go over\nto the Properties on the right hand side,\n\n375\n00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.320\nand then I select Delete\nis what I'm doing.\n\n376\n00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.920\nWhen you delete users their\ndata is deleted, their licenses\n\n377\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.250\nthen can be assigned to other users,\nyou can restore deleted users and\n\n378\n00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.150\ntheir data for\nup to 30 days after you delete them okay?\n\n379\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:26.610\nNow this last sentence right here Daniel\nis actually the most interesting sentence.\n\n380\n00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:31.250\nThe very fact that is says you can\nrestore deleted users and their data for\n\n381\n00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.540\nup to 30 days after you delete them.\n\n382\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.800\nSo this leads you to believe\nthat even if you delete a user,\n\n383\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.530\nthe good thing about this is that Jason\n\n384\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:46.760\nwill no longer have access to\nthe Office 365 once we delete him.\n\n385\n00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.780\nBut what if Jason actually is\ngoing to come back at some point?\n\n386\n00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.020\nOr what if I accidentally deleted him?\n\n387\n00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.860\nI was going through here taking a look\nat multiple users that had left my\n\n388\n00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.050\norganization.\n\n389\n00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.580\nAnd I accidentally clicked on Jason's,\n\n390\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.380\ncause I was just taking a look at the\nproperties and I didn't think about it.\n\n391\n00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.100\nSo instead of clicking cancel,\nI hit delete.\n\n392\n00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.670\nWell if this was a permanent delete.\n\n393\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:11.360\nWell, remember, that means now Jason\ndoesn't have access to his data,\n\n394\n00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.850\ndoesn't have access to anything else if\nyou have anything stored in his account.\n\n395\n00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:20.640\nBut the good thing is because the way\nthe Office 365 ends up working here,\n\n396\n00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.130\nit instead saves his account.\n\n397\n00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.450\nEssentially it's just moving\nit out of one directory and\n\n398\n00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.960\nmoving it into another one, and\ndisabling it at this point.\n\n399\n00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:37.810\nSo this is what Office 365 calls\na soft delete, is what it's called.\n\n400\n00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:42.590\nWhen we do a soft delete, what's happening\nhere is over here on the left hand\n\n401\n00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.880\nside notice that there's the active\nusers which we currently have and\n\n402\n00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.050\nthere's also deleted users right here.\n\n403\n00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.870\nNow if you are familiar with Active\nDirectory, a non premise active directory,\n\n404\n00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.060\nthe main console that you and\nI go to, and Daniel and\n\n405\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.920\nI have actually gone to hundreds of times\nin managing users and computers right,\n\n406\n00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.330\nis what we call Active Directory Users and\nComputers, makes sense.\n\n407\n00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:11.750\nWell notice here that what\nthey call it is Active Users.\n\n408\n00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.190\nNow don't get me wrong that does\nindicate that they are actually part of\n\n409\n00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:20.180\nthe Office 365 but it's also\nan indication that they're part of that\n\n410\n00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:25.580\nActive Directory process in the background\nand this is where Office 365 is\n\n411\n00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.680\nessentially tied into\nthe Azure Active Directory, okay?\n\n412\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.236\nAnd so we have Active Users then, a part\nof that Active Directory that's really\n\n413\n00:22:34.236 --> 00:22:38.248\nrunning in the background, and\nhelping us to manage these users, but\n\n414\n00:22:38.248 --> 00:22:42.208\nthen you have this unusual one\nthat's called Deleted Users as well.\n\n415\n00:22:42.208 --> 00:22:44.816\nNow previously I had deleted\na couple of other users, and\n\n416\n00:22:44.816 --> 00:22:46.294\nyou can see them all right here.\n\n417\n00:22:46.294 --> 00:22:49.292\nSo it actually created those accounts and\ndeleted them too,\n\n418\n00:22:49.292 --> 00:22:52.958\nso when you actually see something\nlike this, why is this actually here?\n\n419\n00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:54.392\nWell this is sort of like,\n\n420\n00:22:54.392 --> 00:22:59.293\nfor those who have actually been running\nsince server 2008 in the Active Directory,\n\n421\n00:22:59.293 --> 00:23:02.780\nthat Active Directory recycle\nbin is what this one is, right.\n\n422\n00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.704\nSo it gives us that ability to\nhold those accounts in place.\n\n423\n00:23:06.704 --> 00:23:11.575\nAnd then if I realized something\nthat Jason is actually coming back I\n\n424\n00:23:11.575 --> 00:23:13.716\ncan select his account then.\n\n425\n00:23:13.716 --> 00:23:17.161\nAnd you'll notice that it actually says,\nplease wait here and\n\n426\n00:23:17.161 --> 00:23:20.682\nit gives me the ability to quickly\nrestore that user if I need to.\n\n427\n00:23:20.682 --> 00:23:24.328\nSo very easy if I select\nRestore the User and\n\n428\n00:23:24.328 --> 00:23:28.887\nnow notice that the user\nrestoration is in progress,\n\n429\n00:23:28.887 --> 00:23:34.940\njason@itprotvdemo.com has\nbeen successfully restored.\n\n430\n00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.908\nAnd now I close and\nnow if I go back to Active Users here,\n\n431\n00:23:39.908 --> 00:23:45.420\nI could see Jason's name was\nadded back in and his is active.\n\n432\n00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:50.167\nSo it does give us that nice\nability to do something like\n\n433\n00:23:50.167 --> 00:23:52.653\nthat if we have access to it.\n\n434\n00:23:52.653 --> 00:23:57.481\nSo being able to restore a users\naccount is something that we all like\n\n435\n00:23:57.481 --> 00:24:02.920\nA lot of times what used to happen\nin that old active directory, right?\n\n436\n00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.526\nYeah, of course I just need\nto disable his account,\n\n437\n00:24:05.526 --> 00:24:08.735\nright click instead of selecting disable,\nyou choose delete.\n\n438\n00:24:08.735 --> 00:24:12.234\nWell, the old active directory,\nyou would have deleted them, the zip,\n\n439\n00:24:12.234 --> 00:24:15.911\neverything is gone and now, Jason goes,\nhey, what happened to my account?\n\n440\n00:24:15.911 --> 00:24:21.071\nOh, nothing happened, and you're either\ngonna do some type of active directory\n\n441\n00:24:21.071 --> 00:24:25.654\nrestore process, you just lost\ntoday's data, don't worry about it.\n\n442\n00:24:25.654 --> 00:24:29.263\nBut, yeah, there's a lot of\ndifferent things that can go on, but\n\n443\n00:24:29.263 --> 00:24:31.842\nthey've actually put\nthis here to help us out,\n\n444\n00:24:31.842 --> 00:24:35.271\nif we actually wanted to do\nsomething like this as well, okay?\n\n445\n00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:39.871\nSo being able to do that really is\nkind of helpful in the very end\n\n446\n00:24:39.871 --> 00:24:43.946\nof us being able to add in\nusers as well as delete users.\n\n447\n00:24:43.946 --> 00:24:49.680\nAnd from that point, you'll see that\ngoing through the admin console,\n\n448\n00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.250\nfairly easy to do, okay?\n\n449\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.850\nBut there is something we do wanna\nshow you, which of course is through\n\n450\n00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:59.340\nthe PowerShell, and how to also\nrestore a user in the PowerShell.\n\n451\n00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:03.090\nSo it's fairly easy enough for\nuse to, so let me go back and\n\n452\n00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.870\nI'm going to delete Jason again here.\n\n453\n00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.110\nSo, Jason's account is\ngetting a workout today.\n\n454\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:16.642\nAnd we'll put them back here and then\nwe'll restore his user account as well.\n\n455\n00:25:16.642 --> 00:25:21.615\nAll right, so how do we do this if we\ndidn't have access to the admin console,\n\n456\n00:25:21.615 --> 00:25:25.821\nbut what if we had access, of course,\nto the active directory for\n\n457\n00:25:25.821 --> 00:25:27.520\nPowerShell to the Azure.\n\n458\n00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.477\nWindows Azure active directory for\nmodule for\n\n459\n00:25:30.477 --> 00:25:33.940\nWindows PowerShell is what we want to do.\n\n460\n00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.120\nSo, let's get into that.\n\n461\n00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.960\nAnd this is where we'll go ahead and\nget started.\n\n462\n00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.970\nNow, when we do this, we need to make\nsure that we connect then of course to\n\n463\n00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:48.820\nthe Microsoft Online as well.\n\n464\n00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.550\nSo, there's a couple things we need to do.\n\n465\n00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.070\nNow every time I've done\nthis throughout this series,\n\n466\n00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:57.290\nI've kind of manually put in my user\ncredentials each and every time.\n\n467\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.770\nNow the reason why I did\nthat is because I wanted\n\n468\n00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.520\nto get you to get used to seeing that,\nright?\n\n469\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.020\nBut there's one more time\nwe're going to do it,\n\n470\n00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.400\nbut we're gonna do this a little\nbit differently this time as well.\n\n471\n00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.736\nSo, what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngoing to create a variable and\n\n472\n00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:15.813\nwe're just going to call is\nmsol credentials here, and\n\n473\n00:26:15.813 --> 00:26:20.440\nwe're gonna make this equal\nto get-credential, all right?\n\n474\n00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.280\nSo when I do that it's gonna ask me for\nmy credentials right here.\n\n475\n00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.484\nI'm gonna try and actually type them in.\n\n476\n00:26:29.484 --> 00:26:32.143\nToday I can't even type in my name,\nhow's that?\n\n477\n00:26:32.143 --> 00:26:33.362\nThat's actually getting worse then.\n\n478\n00:26:35.845 --> 00:26:41.417\nAnd then, I'm going to go ahead and\npaste in my password and get that.\n\n479\n00:26:41.417 --> 00:26:43.694\nNow you might be wondering why is\nthis actually something helpful?\n\n480\n00:26:43.694 --> 00:26:49.005\nWell, it's helpful because now\nI've created that variable,\n\n481\n00:26:49.005 --> 00:26:55.550\nthis $msocred and when I do this now and\nI need to get connected, right?\n\n482\n00:26:55.550 --> 00:27:03.010\nSo this is where I type in\nconnect-msolservice, all right?\n\n483\n00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:10.630\nWhen I do so I can do a -credential and\n\n484\n00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:15.319\nthen I can do the $msolcred and\n\n485\n00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:20.750\nunless I typed it in wrong, notice it\ndidn't bring up the credential for me.\n\n486\n00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.290\nYou might be wondering why is that\nactually important because now every time\n\n487\n00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:27.150\nthat I'm actually gonna get\nasked a credential that I know\n\n488\n00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.230\nI can just use this instead and\nthat way it will automatically type it in.\n\n489\n00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:31.820\nIt will make it a little bit easier.\n\n490\n00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.800\nIt's not on the exam so\nmuch if you're actually getting ready for\n\n491\n00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.220\nthe exam, but it is something that's gonna\nbe useful as you actually had to type in\n\n492\n00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.220\nseveral things.\n\n493\n00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.640\nAll right, so let's see who's\nactually been deleted here.\n\n494\n00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.275\nSo I'm going to get a get-msoluser.\n\n495\n00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:52.160\nAnd from here, and\ndo a -ReturnDeletedUsers.\n\n496\n00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.090\nSo when we take a look,\nhere's the actual accounts that are in my\n\n497\n00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.150\nrecycle bin right now and\nhere's Jason's account.\n\n498\n00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.371\nHis is the only one that I haven't\nactually returned before I actually\n\n499\n00:28:01.371 --> 00:28:03.110\ndeleted and added him back in.\n\n500\n00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.577\nSame thing also happened here as well,\nokay?\n\n501\n00:28:05.577 --> 00:28:09.951\nSo when we take a look here,\nI want to restore Jason's account,\n\n502\n00:28:09.951 --> 00:28:11.896\nif I actually wanna do this.\n\n503\n00:28:11.896 --> 00:28:16.996\nSo, the way that we do that is that we\n\n504\n00:28:16.996 --> 00:28:22.097\ncan also do a restore-msoluser and\n\n505\n00:28:22.097 --> 00:28:30.768\nthen from this point I can\nactually do userprincipalname and\n\n506\n00:28:30.768 --> 00:28:36.901\nthis would be jason@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n507\n00:28:36.901 --> 00:28:43.530\nAnd then I have to do\nthe autoreconcileProxyConflicts.\n\n508\n00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.222\nSo if there is some synchronization\nthing that's going on and\n\n509\n00:28:47.222 --> 00:28:51.843\nwe're having an issue this will help to\nrestore that and then I give him a new.\n\n510\n00:28:54.964 --> 00:29:00.950\nUserPrincipalName and\nit'd be the same thing,\n\n511\n00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.600\nJason@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n512\n00:29:06.923 --> 00:29:11.450\nSo in a moment here, you actually see\nthat he is now licensed once again.\n\n513\n00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.141\nAnd so we can actually use\nthat to help us out and\n\n514\n00:29:14.141 --> 00:29:17.045\nlet's verify that Jason's\naccount's in here.\n\n515\n00:29:17.045 --> 00:29:19.089\nNow look at this, Daniel.\n\n516\n00:29:19.089 --> 00:29:20.810\nI don't see his account in here.\n\n517\n00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:23.370\nAnd the reason why, it's not updating,\nit's not actually refreshing.\n\n518\n00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.940\nI go ahead and hit the little\nrefresh button, there it is,\n\n519\n00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.730\nJason's account now\nactually appears back here.\n\n520\n00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.963\nSo when you actually do\nsomething like this,\n\n521\n00:29:31.963 --> 00:29:35.801\nyou can actually use something like\nPowerShell to actually do both, right?\n\n522\n00:29:35.801 --> 00:29:37.810\nWe can actually delete a user,\n\n523\n00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:41.838\nwe can also add a user back in\nfrom that restore if we needed to.\n\n524\n00:29:41.838 --> 00:29:46.840\nNow, when you take a look\nremember that it has 30 days.\n\n525\n00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.720\nSo in other words, after 30 days, his\naccount will then disappear forever and\n\n526\n00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.830\nthat's when you will lose it if\nyou don't actually take a look and\n\n527\n00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.670\ntake some time to manage that.\n\n528\n00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.740\nSo just kinda be aware that being\nable to do it from the PowerShell,\n\n529\n00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.670\nbeing able to actually do it through\nthe user interface, both are very\n\n530\n00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.790\npossible, whichever one you're actually\nmost comfortable with, and of course on\n\n531\n00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:09.910\nthe exam you need to know both if\nyou're actually preparing for the exam.\n\n532\n00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.470\nIt's always easy to actually\nnot think about that.\n\n533\n00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:16.200\nRemember the basics here on\nthat deleted users, right?\n\n534\n00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.845\nThat it gives you 30 days, and\n30 days after that, it's been 31 days,\n\n535\n00:30:20.845 --> 00:30:24.440\nyou're not gonna recover Jason's account,\nright?\n\n536\n00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.530\nAs long as it's under that 30,\nyou can use either one of those and\n\n537\n00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:28.970\nyou can recover his account.\n\n538\n00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:32.710\nYou also know how to add\nin bulk accounts as well.\n\n539\n00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.530\nSo take some time and actually be able to\npractice and manage that just briefly.\n\n540\n00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.907\nWhen you're done,\ndelete out those practice accounts and\n\n541\n00:30:39.907 --> 00:30:40.959\nthen you're ready to go.\n\n542\n00:30:40.959 --> 00:30:44.240\nSo there's also one other thing\nwe need to talk about, right?\n\n543\n00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.070\nIt's not just enough to make sure that\nusers are actually set into Office 365\n\n544\n00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:54.050\nwhether we're using the PowerShell or\nof course the Office Admin Center.\n\n545\n00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.501\nWe also need to talk briefly\nabout how do we set up for\n\n546\n00:30:57.501 --> 00:31:01.090\nmulti-factor authentication for our users.\n\n547\n00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.400\nMore and more as we actually\nare connected online it's no\n\n548\n00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.540\nlonger enough just to give those\npasswords actually the full weight and\n\n549\n00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.650\nthe full brunt of security that\nthey need to be able to withhold.\n\n550\n00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.320\nRight now I showed you the passwords and\nthen that's where some of the problems end\n\n551\n00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.700\nup existing, is that if a user shares a\npassword that means they can get access to\n\n552\n00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.730\ntheir Office 365 account and\nthen someone else's.\n\n553\n00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:27.588\nSo another way to ensure that the password\nis no longer the last line of defense\n\n554\n00:31:27.588 --> 00:31:32.296\nis to realize that Office 365 by default\nwants you to be able to pick up and\n\n555\n00:31:32.296 --> 00:31:35.082\nset up for multi-factor authentication.\n\n556\n00:31:35.082 --> 00:31:38.501\nNow when we working with this\nin Office 365, just briefly,\n\n557\n00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:42.970\nthere's multiple levels of, I hate to\nsay it, multi-factor authentication.\n\n558\n00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:47.875\nAlmost sounds like one of those\npyramid things, multi-level marketing,\n\n559\n00:31:47.875 --> 00:31:49.570\nbut it really is, right?\n\n560\n00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.661\nIt depends on how much you\nare willing to invest in it.\n\n561\n00:31:51.661 --> 00:31:55.721\nIf you just have Office 365,\nthey've already got the basic background,\n\n562\n00:31:55.721 --> 00:31:59.664\nin other words, the infrastructure set\nup so that you can take advantage.\n\n563\n00:31:59.664 --> 00:32:02.764\nOf just the most basic of\nmulti factor authentication.\n\n564\n00:32:02.764 --> 00:32:06.170\nSo let's show you how to\nactually set that up as well.\n\n565\n00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:10.510\nSo I'm simply going to close out of my\nWindows power shell and then make sure I'm\n\n566\n00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:15.690\nactually inside of the active users\ninside of the Office 365 admin center.\n\n567\n00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.161\nAnd up here at the top,\n\n568\n00:32:17.161 --> 00:32:22.090\nyou see where it says Set Multi Factor\nauthentication requirements.\n\n569\n00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.320\nAnd you click on this\nlink that says Setup.\n\n570\n00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.370\nAnd in a moment when you click on the link\nthat says Setup here, what it should\n\n571\n00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:34.100\nbring us to is another page where it\ngives us that ability to now set this up.\n\n572\n00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.730\nSo this actually does give now\nevery user that extra ability\n\n573\n00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:42.910\nthat in case they end up losing\nthe password, they can actually do this.\n\n574\n00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:47.440\nNow you'll see that I've already set one\nup for Daniel's account here if we wanted\n\n575\n00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.260\nto, and then of course you can actually\nbulk update it if you want as well for\n\n576\n00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.140\nall the users.\n\n577\n00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:59.370\nThat's probably a good thing but remember\nthat inside of your network you may still\n\n578\n00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:04.950\nhave the user that's still not willing\nto flip over and do something like this.\n\n579\n00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:08.950\nSo it might be where you actually do this\njust for people that are traveling outside\n\n580\n00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:12.515\nof your organization, and\nthey're always out there, okay.\n\n581\n00:33:12.515 --> 00:33:15.710\nBut you can actually select it and\nmake it fairly easy.\n\n582\n00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:20.780\nSo let's say I select Erin's name here,\nand then when I do so over on the right\n\n583\n00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.830\nhand side, you see it's fairly quick,\nI simply select Enable at this point and\n\n584\n00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:30.250\nthere it is, now enabling multi factor\noff, please read that deployment guide.\n\n585\n00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:33.390\nIf your users do not regularly\nsign in through the browser,\n\n586\n00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:37.300\nyou can send them this link to register\nfor multi factor authentication.\n\n587\n00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:42.010\nAnd then I simply enable that,\nand that will now go ahead and\n\n588\n00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.670\nsend them the information, if I wanted to,\n\n589\n00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.740\nto say, here's what's going\nto happen from this point on.\n\n590\n00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:52.700\nSo by doing this, it really does help\nto provide that extra layer of security\n\n591\n00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:58.550\nthat we want for users that we're actually\ngoing to have inside of Office 365.\n\n592\n00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:03.630\nRemember that even though they\ngive us a fairly simple password,\n\n593\n00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:04.770\neven though it is complex, right?\n\n594\n00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.720\nIt meets all the complexity requirements,\nit's not very difficult,\n\n595\n00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.820\nit's a combination of four letters and\nfour numbers.\n\n596\n00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:16.050\nThat still is a relatively complex, but\nremember that that means that anybody,\n\n597\n00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:20.430\nany malicious user, all they need is\nfour letters and four numbers, and\n\n598\n00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:22.770\nthey'll be able to get into that account.\n\n599\n00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:27.710\nBy using the multi factor authentication,\nthis actually allows them to be able to\n\n600\n00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.510\nhave that, but they still need that second\nfactor, however it's gonna be setup.\n\n601\n00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:35.530\nNormally this is going to be a device\nthat they are going to text a number to\n\n602\n00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.710\nis what we're gonna end up seeing, or\n\n603\n00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:42.610\nit's gonna be a phone call is\nalso the way to go as well.\n\n604\n00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:44.870\nAnd you can even have this of\ncourse where you actually go and\n\n605\n00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.880\ndo some biometric stuff if you wanted to,\nbut\n\n606\n00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.940\nusually the most basic when you're not\npaying extra for it is gonna be this way,\n\n607\n00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.950\nit's gonna be either that text number or\nthat phone call that you're gonna get.\n\n608\n00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:59.930\nSo by being able to actually\npull in all that information,\n\n609\n00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:04.220\nremember that you now know how to add in a\nbunch of users at one time if you need to.\n\n610\n00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.430\nWe showed you where you\ncould delete users too, and\n\n611\n00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:12.470\nshowed you how you could also use\nPowershell to manage those deleted users.\n\n612\n00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.620\nAnd we're actually going to have\nanother episode where we take a look\n\n613\n00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.720\nat adding in bulk users using Powershell,\nbut\n\n614\n00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.680\nthat's actually gonna come in\na little bit later on for us.\n\n615\n00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.270\nBut then, the last thing here,\nmultifactor authentication as well.\n\n616\n00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.851\nSomething that we all need to\nconsider in this day and age,\n\n617\n00:35:27.851 --> 00:35:30.720\nbecause remember that the world\nis not getting any safer.\n\n618\n00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.110\nYou can't trust a lot more people, and\nwith now having cloud services as part of\n\n619\n00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.595\nyour organization, you definitely wanna\nmake sure that it's gonna be protected.\n\n620\n00:35:38.595 --> 00:35:41.760\nMulti-factor authentication is\na stronger authentication for\n\n621\n00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.940\nus that we should all get used to using.\n\n622\n00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.150\nYes, it's definitely a lot\nof information packed into\n\n623\n00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.920\ntwo short little episodes here.\n\n624\n00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.760\nWhen it comes to managing users or\npasswords, or\n\n625\n00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.650\nworking with multi-factor authentication,\nyou do need to know a few things.\n\n626\n00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:58.320\nBut the good thing is that\nRonnie laid it out pretty well.\n\n627\n00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.700\nI think you did a great job.\n\n628\n00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.750\nSo if you follow his advice,\nyou look at all the steps he showed you,\n\n629\n00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:06.248\nyou should be able to get to where\nyou need to go inside of Office 365.\n\n630\n00:36:06.248 --> 00:36:09.305\nRonnie, thank you for showing us how\nto do that, explaining that for us.\n\n631\n00:36:09.305 --> 00:36:12.405\nAnd I guess we have come to the end of yet\nanother great episode here.\n\n632\n00:36:12.405 --> 00:36:13.885\nThank you guys so much for watching.\n\n633\n00:36:13.885 --> 00:36:15.725\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n634\n00:36:15.725 --> 00:36:17.465\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n635\n00:36:17.465 --> 00:36:18.215\nAnd I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n636\n00:36:18.215 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.296 --> 00:00:17.980\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.890\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with our good old Microsoft Office\n\n5\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.090\n365 identities and requirements, you know\nit, you love it, it's always a good time.\n\n6\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.909\nAnd joining me again on the studio,\n\n7\n00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.728\nlending his expertise on that topic to\nhelp us wade through all the myriad of\n\n8\n00:00:32.728 --> 00:00:35.410\ndifferent pieces of\ninformation that go on with it.\n\n9\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.372\nWell it's still in there with\nmy good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:37.372 --> 00:00:38.498\nWell Ronnie, welcome to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:43.220\n>> Thank you for inviting me again as we\ncontinue on to take a look at Office 365\n\n12\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.480\nand specifically,\ntalking about managing cloud identities.\n\n13\n00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.000\nAnd we know that we can actually go\ninto the Office 365 admin center.\n\n14\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.180\nWe know that we can create accounts,\nindividual accounts.\n\n15\n00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.480\nWe also know that we can add in\nCSV files through that as well.\n\n16\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.700\nAnd even do a few other things\ninside of that admin center.\n\n17\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.671\nBut there's also times, of course,\n\n18\n00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:09.128\nthat what is very important is\nthe efficiency of things that we do.\n\n19\n00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:10.840\nAnd so that means a lot of times,\n\n20\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.902\nwhat we wanna do instead is work inside\nof the PowerShell to allow us to do some\n\n21\n00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:18.920\nof the same tasks that we would\nnormally do inside that admin center.\n\n22\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.030\nAnd the reason why is because there's\na lot of times where the stuff that we do,\n\n23\n00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.470\nright, has has to be done over and\nover again.\n\n24\n00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.610\nOr there's things that we can\nscript instead that allow us to be\n\n25\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.290\nable to do bulk ads and\nbulk changes and do other things.\n\n26\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.040\nAnd this is where PowerShell\ncomes in more handy\n\n27\n00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.660\nthan going to the admin center as well.\n\n28\n00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.790\nSo there are things that we can do\ninside a PowerShell which we don't\n\n29\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.930\nhave the ability to do inside\nof the admin center and\n\n30\n00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.770\nthey might do that on purpose, right?\n\n31\n00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.613\nWe've talked about it\nbefore on other episodes.\n\n32\n00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:53.805\nThat sometimes they don't wanna make it\nsuper easy for somebody to, let's say for\n\n33\n00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:59.790\nexample, accidentally delete users out\nof the Office 365 users account, right.\n\n34\n00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.180\nSo they do give us that 30 day grace\nperiod where if we delete a regular user,\n\n35\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.220\nthat what ends up happening there\nis that it actually sends it to\n\n36\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.880\nessentially the same thing.\n\n37\n00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.990\nAn Active Directory Recycle Bin inside of\nthe Azure cloud, and it holds it there for\n\n38\n00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.030\n30 days before it's permanently deleted.\n\n39\n00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.060\nSo this means that somebody can't\njust go into that recycle bin and\n\n40\n00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.500\nbe able to show a place\nwhere you can delete it, and\n\n41\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.430\nthat's only gonna be\ndone through PowerShell.\n\n42\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.670\nAnd so one of them may actually be where\nif you really wanna seriously delete that,\n\n43\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.960\nyou'll do a little bit of research.\n\n44\n00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.130\nAnd you're gonna have to have those admin\nprivileges that allow you to be able to\n\n45\n00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.540\ndo this as well.\n\n46\n00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.230\nAnd then from that point,\nyou can actually do what you want to.\n\n47\n00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.190\nSecondly though, they want to actually\nmake sure that everything works in\n\n48\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.290\nPowerShell before anything is\never done through the GUI and\n\n49\n00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.200\nthat's just part of anything\nthat Microsoft does as well.\n\n50\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.690\nAnd it just makes it easier\nbecause the scripting part\n\n51\n00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.750\nis something that they're really\npushing for the admin privileges.\n\n52\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.309\nSo one of the first things that we want to\nactually be able to do, of course then,\n\n53\n00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.387\nis when we start talking\nabout using the PowerShell.\n\n54\n00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:04.050\nOne of the things that we wanna do is be\nable to modify some different attributes.\n\n55\n00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.380\nSo one of the top things\nthat ends up happening,\n\n56\n00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.685\nespecially you're gonna be\nworking with Office 365.\n\n57\n00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:13.215\nAnd then also with an on\npremises Active Directory,\n\n58\n00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:18.625\nmight be to create a user account in\nwhich the password does not expire.\n\n59\n00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:20.235\nNow, Daniel, when you and\n\n60\n00:03:20.235 --> 00:03:24.325\nI have actually worked with accounts\nin which the passwords don't expire.\n\n61\n00:03:24.325 --> 00:03:27.325\nWhat's a good reason for me to actually\ncreate something like that if I'm working\n\n62\n00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:28.865\njust in a regular Active Directory.\n\n63\n00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:31.315\n>> Yeah, a really good reason that you\nwould want to create an account where the\n\n64\n00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:34.940\npassword never expires, it's because it's\nprobably what's know as a service account.\n\n65\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.310\nThis is where you need a username and\na password like a legitimate\n\n66\n00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.400\nlog in to work with some sort\nof software or a service itself.\n\n67\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.478\nAnd yeah, you know what?\n\n68\n00:03:44.478 --> 00:03:45.290\nI don't wanna use mine and\n\n69\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.700\nI don't wanna use Ronnie's\nbecause we're legitimate users.\n\n70\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.100\nI don't wanna leave that going on and\nno one ever use it.\n\n71\n00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.540\nSo we create a service account and\nthen we set the password to never expire.\n\n72\n00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.358\nThe reason we say no expiration on that,\nthat's just crazy talk.\n\n73\n00:03:57.358 --> 00:03:58.845\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't make a password that never\n\n74\n00:03:58.845 --> 00:04:02.091\nexpires, your security, you're horrible,\nyou don't know what you're talking about.\n\n75\n00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:05.430\nWell, yeah, we do, [LAUGH] and here's why.\n\n76\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.660\nYou make an account that the password\ndoesn't expire because if it expires,\n\n77\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.580\nwhat happens?\n\n78\n00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.960\nWell, whatever's using that\naccount is going to break.\n\n79\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.450\nAnd then you as an admin, you have to go\nin and you have to change the password.\n\n80\n00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.090\nFollow the complexity rules, do everything\nthat's necessary to get that password\n\n81\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.080\nchanged, then fire back up your service,\nor whatever it is.\n\n82\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.590\nAll the while, people are trying\nto access that service and\n\n83\n00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.340\nthey're not able to do\nit because it's broken.\n\n84\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.003\nAnd once it gets back up and running,\nthen you're able to go back to it.\n\n85\n00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:34.656\nAnd then 30 days, 40 days, 60,\nwhatever you got it set to,\n\n86\n00:04:34.656 --> 00:04:38.440\ngoes along, it breaks again,\nyou gotta repeat the process.\n\n87\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.190\nSo we make a service account,\npassword never expires.\n\n88\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.750\nWe use good security practice,\nlong passwords with required complexity,\n\n89\n00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.930\nstrength, and length,\n\n90\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.840\nwhatever you need to make sure that that's\nan uncrackable thing and then you go on.\n\n91\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.180\nSo that would be reasons\nwe would want to do this.\n\n92\n00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.300\nAnd the fact that we can use PowerShell\nis gonna make it a whole lot easier for\n\n93\n00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.740\nus because then we can get into\nthings like scripting if necessary.\n\n94\n00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.200\n>> Right,\nby using something like this, right,\n\n95\n00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.730\non an Active Directory on premises\nin which you and I actually have,\n\n96\n00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.300\nthat's the main reason why we'd end\nup creating accounts like that too.\n\n97\n00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.550\nWell, now that we're actually moving\ninto the part of our series here where\n\n98\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.150\nwe're gonna see that what we're gonna\nbe doing is synchronizing things.\n\n99\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.070\nLike Active Directory on my premises\n\n100\n00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.700\nalong with Active Directory\nthat's gonna be in the cloud.\n\n101\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.020\nWell there's gonna be things that\nwe have to be able to do and\n\n102\n00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.020\nbe able to manage on both sides.\n\n103\n00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.233\nWell, remember that we're gonna actually\nget those different types of account\n\n104\n00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:33.317\nmanagements that we have, where we're\ngonna be asked to change passwords.\n\n105\n00:05:33.317 --> 00:05:38.430\nUsers in Office 365 are gonna be asked\nto change passwords on a regular basis.\n\n106\n00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.504\nUsage, excuse me, of accounts inside\nof my own Active Directory on premises\n\n107\n00:05:42.504 --> 00:05:46.670\nsomewhere, we are also gonna be\nasked to change passwords there too.\n\n108\n00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.520\nSo regardless, we're gonna be\nasked to change passwords, but\n\n109\n00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.290\nwhat about those things that always\nhave to stay connected to one another.\n\n110\n00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.880\nThis is where Daniel's scenario\n\n111\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.710\nreally does set us up to understand while\nwe might need to set up a user account\n\n112\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.390\nin which the password\ndoesn't actually expire.\n\n113\n00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.510\nAnd then being able to take that and\nscript it and\n\n114\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.840\nrun it into other scripts and things\nthat actually we wanna make sure that\n\n115\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.480\nare never gonna have to ask us for\na password again is also a key.\n\n116\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.960\n>> And Ronnie,\nI just wanna make one caveat there.\n\n117\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.200\nJust because it doesn't expire\ndoesn't mean it never gets changed.\n\n118\n00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.015\n>> Right.\n>> It just means that the system is not\n\n119\n00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:24.490\ngonna say this is no longer valid at\nsome inconvenient point and time.\n\n120\n00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.610\nWe do change those passwords\nfrom time to time.\n\n121\n00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.870\nWe just don't let the system break it for\nus.\n\n122\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.260\n>> Yeah, and that's a very good point and\nthank you, Daniel, for making that.\n\n123\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.936\nYes, you should change your\nservice account passwords,\n\n124\n00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.030\nit should be on a regular basis at times.\n\n125\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.050\nBut remember, you're controlling\nit rather than allowing either\n\n126\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.860\nOffice 365 to do it or allowing\nthe Active Directory to do it instead.\n\n127\n00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.850\nAnd so that's what you're actually\ndoing is you're managing it yourself.\n\n128\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.060\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate one of these accounts and\n\n129\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.640\nthen set the password to not expire and\nmake sure it actually takes place.\n\n130\n00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.540\nNow we need to do this inside of Office\n365, we can do it inside of that\n\n131\n00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.690\nOffice 365 admin center, but let's do\nit through the PowerShell instead.\n\n132\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.480\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nget connected to our Office 365 here.\n\n133\n00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.640\nSo on this connection,\nI'm gonna do connect-msolservice.\n\n134\n00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.891\nAnd then it's gonna ask me for\nmy credentials.\n\n135\n00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:23.270\nAnd then I'm gonna paste\nmy password right in here.\n\n136\n00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.030\nAnd click OK, and in a moment,\nit should take it and there it is.\n\n137\n00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:32.462\nI am now connected in to my ITProTV\ndemo account and so now I can actually\n\n138\n00:07:32.462 --> 00:07:38.552\nstart entering in the stuff that I need\nto to get connected into Office 365.\n\n139\n00:07:38.552 --> 00:07:41.419\nSo the first thing I wanna do\nis I wanna create an account and\n\n140\n00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:45.280\nI'm just gonna create one that I know I'm\ngonna be using later on in the show for\n\n141\n00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.820\nmy directory sync administration,\nit's what I'm gonna do.\n\n142\n00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.910\nSo I wanna actually set that up.\n\n143\n00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.064\nSo we're gonna call it Sync Admin\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n144\n00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:59.517\nSo here it's gonna be New-MsolUser,\nso I'm gonna create a new user.\n\n145\n00:07:59.517 --> 00:08:04.850\nAnd then I need to establish\nthe UserPrincipleName.\n\n146\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:10.549\nAnd the UserPrincipleName here is gonna\n\n147\n00:08:10.549 --> 00:08:15.749\nbe syncAdmin@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n148\n00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:18.569\nAnd then I need to actually\nadd in a display name.\n\n149\n00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:30.110\nAnd this is gonna be SyncAdmin,\nand then I'm gonna do a FirstName.\n\n150\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.560\nAnd this of course will be sync.\n\n151\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:38.020\nAnd then a Lastname, and\nthen we'll do Admin right here.\n\n152\n00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.210\nPress Enter and in a moment, there it is.\n\n153\n00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.450\nNotice this actually created it, it's\ngiving me a generic password right now.\n\n154\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.410\nAnd remember that since this is actually\na password that's being generated\n\n155\n00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.480\nby Office 365 and\nI now have this account that I'm doing,\n\n156\n00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.170\nI don't have a license assigned to it cuz\nnobody's ever gonna really use this here.\n\n157\n00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.420\nThat's perfectly fine, but I want to make\nsure that this password isn't going to\n\n158\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.600\nchange is what I want to do.\n\n159\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.160\nSo I can use any account\nthat I want to but\n\n160\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.650\nsetting this aside as being one\nthat we're just going to use for\n\n161\n00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.610\nthings like installing the directory sync\nand configuring some of the directory sync\n\n162\n00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.330\ninformation, this is probably actually\na good one for us to be able to use.\n\n163\n00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:20.193\nSo now once we actually have that account\nwe want to set this up to have a password\n\n164\n00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:21.970\nthat is not going to expire.\n\n165\n00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:27.827\nSo at this point we go ahead and\nwe type in set-MsolUser,\n\n166\n00:09:27.827 --> 00:09:34.056\nand then we need to call upon\nthat UserprincipalName again.\n\n167\n00:09:34.056 --> 00:09:37.579\nAnd this is the one we're gonna do,\n\n168\n00:09:37.579 --> 00:09:43.099\nwhich is gonna be\nthe syncadmin@itprotvdemo.com and\n\n169\n00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:46.505\nthere's gonna be another dash and\n\n170\n00:09:46.505 --> 00:09:51.329\nthere's gonna be that\npassword never expires.\n\n171\n00:09:51.329 --> 00:09:54.185\nRemember that if you're doing that\ntab fill and its not working for\n\n172\n00:09:54.185 --> 00:09:57.806\nyou it probably means you just didn't type\nin enough letters for it to recognize it,\n\n173\n00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:01.610\nbut once you get past that point where it\nbecomes less ambiguous you can do this.\n\n174\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.110\nNow just setting this up is not enough\nbecause we can actually turn this\n\n175\n00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.160\noff as well.\n\n176\n00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.640\nIf I said this is password never expires,\n\n177\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.080\nthe way that I do that is\nby actually assigning true.\n\n178\n00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.910\nOr, if I wanted to make sure, let's say,\nthat I choose to use a different one after\n\n179\n00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.290\na while,\nI can actually go to that account.\n\n180\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.510\nAnd if the password isn't expiring and\nI wanna change it,\n\n181\n00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.010\nI simply set this to false and\nthen we can have that too.\n\n182\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.289\nSo now I can do true.\n\n183\n00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.190\nPress Enter.\n\n184\n00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.350\nAnd this will now create that particular\nuser account inside of Office 365 for\n\n185\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.690\nme and\nset the password as being never expires.\n\n186\n00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.760\nNow lets verify that.\n\n187\n00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.080\nSo let me go to my Office 365, and\n\n188\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.669\nhere it is already in the admin center and\nI need to refresh this.\n\n189\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.938\nAnd when I do so, there is that\nsync admin that was just created,\n\n190\n00:10:52.938 --> 00:10:55.863\nand if I go ahead and take a look at the,\n\n191\n00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:59.810\nlet me see if it's actually\nin the edit here or not.\n\n192\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.310\nI don't know if it actually\nshows up here or not, but\n\n193\n00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:08.090\nyou can see where it actually did pick up\nfirst name, the admin as a last name, and\n\n194\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.170\nsync admin and\nfrom this point we have other things.\n\n195\n00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.120\nNow, you treat this as just a regular\naccount that you would do this.\n\n196\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.940\nSo if I know that I'm gonna be doing\nsomething like the sync admin stuff,\n\n197\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.690\nI'm probably gonna need to actually assign\nit the global admin, because it needs to\n\n198\n00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:28.380\nhave administrative rights over Office 365\nand then on my active directory side, I'll\n\n199\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.500\nprobably need to create a matching account\nas well, at least for that side too.\n\n200\n00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.230\nSo it just depends on what\nneeds to be done here.\n\n201\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.650\nSo this account will actually have that\n\n202\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.690\nwhere we don't have to\nworry about that one.\n\n203\n00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.640\nAnd at that point I'm just going\nto leave it kind of there and\n\n204\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.980\nif I wanted to I could disable it for\nright now.\n\n205\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.990\nAnd that way until I actually need\nit I don't have to worry about it.\n\n206\n00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.820\nBut after you actually use it you're not\ngoing to be able to disable it especially\n\n207\n00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.560\nfor things you're going to be using\nbecause it's going to check in.\n\n208\n00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.600\nIt's going to continue to ask for\npasswords.\n\n209\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.252\nLike the directory sync, it's going\nto take place every three hours.\n\n210\n00:11:58.252 --> 00:12:00.190\nIt's gonna ask for\na username and password, so\n\n211\n00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.750\nyou can't just disable it at that point.\n\n212\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.760\nYou don't wanna get rid of it.\n\n213\n00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.541\nBut this is something that you do want to\nbe able to do, is make sure that you can\n\n214\n00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:12.780\ncreate an account in PowerShell, make sure\nthat the password never expires, too.\n\n215\n00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.442\n>> That's right, now that's not the only\ngame in town, it's not the only trick this\n\n216\n00:12:16.442 --> 00:12:19.760\nlittle PowerShell doohickey can do,\nbut obviously it's a very good one.\n\n217\n00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.700\nIt's one where, you gotta remember\nthat when you're talking PowerShell\n\n218\n00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.160\nyou're probably going to be\ndoing some sort of scripting.\n\n219\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.230\nYou're learning these commands so\nthat you can use them later,\n\n220\n00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.610\nyou're gonna create variables which\nwill then allow you to create a script\n\n221\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.310\nto do the things you need them to do.\n\n222\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.770\nRemember scripting is about automation,\nthings I do over and over and over again.\n\n223\n00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.070\nLet the script take care of that.\n\n224\n00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.410\nAll I need to do is throw some variables\nat it and it does a very good job.\n\n225\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.570\nSpeaking of that,\n\n226\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:47.520\none of the ways in which we probably would\nbe scripting is with bulk or user add.\n\n227\n00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.410\nThis is the most tedious and\nmonotonous job you'll ever have.\n\n228\n00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:57.210\nWhen they say, hey, we've got 112 users\nthat we need to add to this system\n\n229\n00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.740\nthat's being migrated over from the old\nsystem, and we need you to do that.\n\n230\n00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.040\nWell, Ronnie, it's a whole lot of fun, and\nwhen I say a whole lot of fun I mean we\n\n231\n00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.930\nhave to talk you off the ledge most\nlikely after about the fourth person.\n\n232\n00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:13.320\nTo input that user information one at\na time, and the admin portal's there, and\n\n233\n00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.160\nit's nice, but\n\n234\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.540\nwhen I got 112 users I gotta put in,\nI'm running to the PowerShell.\n\n235\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.180\n>> That's exactly what you\nwant to be able to do.\n\n236\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.160\nRemember that what ends up\nhappening with most companies,\n\n237\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.260\nright, is the same thing\nthat happens every day.\n\n238\n00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.050\nPeople will,\nespecially if your company's large, right?\n\n239\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.420\nMaybe get hired if not on a daily basis,\nweekly, or monthly basis.\n\n240\n00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.689\nAnd that means we're\nadding in more people.\n\n241\n00:13:33.689 --> 00:13:37.535\nAnd a lot of times it may not be that\nthey're hiring individual users one at\n\n242\n00:13:37.535 --> 00:13:41.829\na time, but they may be hiring, let's say,\n10 or 15 people at the same time.\n\n243\n00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:46.184\nAnd that means Daniel's job is a lot\nharder, even working through the Office\n\n244\n00:13:46.184 --> 00:13:51.008\n365 portal, if he's having to go in there\ninstead and actually add each one of them\n\n245\n00:13:51.008 --> 00:13:55.631\nin there one at a time and assign them\nparticular roles, if they're admin roles,\n\n246\n00:13:55.631 --> 00:14:00.340\nor make sure they're actually part of\nwhatever groups that are actually created.\n\n247\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.830\nBut instead,\nwhat we can do is do a bulk add.\n\n248\n00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.460\nNow we were able to do this\nin a previous episode.\n\n249\n00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.010\nLet me show you where we did this,\nas well.\n\n250\n00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.190\nInside of The Office admin\n\n251\n00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.440\ncenter remember that we can\nalways come here and there it is.\n\n252\n00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.510\nThere's a Bulk Add button.\n\n253\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.500\nAnd all I need to do if\nI wanted to do that,\n\n254\n00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.090\nlet me see if I can click on it again.\n\n255\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.300\nThere it goes.\n\n256\n00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.200\nIt says a critical error so apparently\nI opened that way too fast here.\n\n257\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.590\nLet me just get out of that.\n\n258\n00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.870\nLet me see if I can come back to it.\n\n259\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.570\nSo here there's actually going to be that\nlittle button, and then it brings up of\n\n260\n00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:40.610\ncourse the menu for us, oops, it looks\nlike it's gonna log in, maybe not.\n\n261\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.150\n>> Already seeing the advantages\nof the power shell.\n\n262\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.910\n>> Yeah, man, now you're seeing\nthe advantages of the PowerShell.\n\n263\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.830\nBut once it actually does log in and\nwe can actually see that,\n\n264\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.400\nright, it just brings us in through\na menu and it's saying hey,\n\n265\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.960\nlook, take a look at this file\nin which you already have\n\n266\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.770\nthe users set up the way that we need\nto and it imports them right in.\n\n267\n00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:02.380\nSo we did create a couple of user accounts\nusing that in a previous episode.\n\n268\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.940\nWe can do the same thing here.\n\n269\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.890\nNow it's a little bit more complex\nif you've never done it before, but\n\n270\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.740\nat the same time it really\ncan save you time after\n\n271\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.430\nyou actually spend the initial time\ngetting one of these files ready.\n\n272\n00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:20.460\nSo let me give you an example of a file\nthat I've already gotten prepared here.\n\n273\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.780\nSo I know that when I create\na basic user account, okay,\n\n274\n00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.520\ninside of Office 365, I know I need\nwhat's called a User Principal Name.\n\n275\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.491\nI'm usually gonna need first name,\nlast name, and\n\n276\n00:15:32.491 --> 00:15:36.475\nalso by default I need a display name,\nthat's actually essential for\n\n277\n00:15:36.475 --> 00:15:41.292\nus, usage, location, and maybe even what\nlicense I want to assign to them, okay.\n\n278\n00:15:41.292 --> 00:15:45.493\nNow doing something like this is\nessentially not super difficult if you\n\n279\n00:15:45.493 --> 00:15:49.484\nknow somebody that knows how to\nactually retrieve this information\n\n280\n00:15:49.484 --> 00:15:54.400\nfrom the active directory and be able to\nactually put it in this .csv file, right?\n\n281\n00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.977\nThis is stuff that we can script out.\n\n282\n00:15:55.977 --> 00:15:57.208\n>> Oh yeah, totally.\n\n283\n00:15:57.208 --> 00:16:01.002\nPower Shell will actually do this\nyou can write a Power Shell script\n\n284\n00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:04.360\nthat will export all this\ninformation into a CSV file.\n\n285\n00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.930\nYou can check out tech net or\ndo the other Microsoft.\n\n286\n00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.070\n>> Sites.\n>> Yeah, sites that they have available.\n\n287\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.050\nI used to use a cool little program,\nit's not a Microsoft program.\n\n288\n00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.050\nIt was called Lazy Windows Admin or\nLazy Win Admin.\n\n289\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:20.540\nIt was great, did all this kind of stuff,\nthey're a third party, free utilities even\n\n290\n00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.180\nthat will allow you to do this, you don't\nhave to be a Power Shell guru, you just\n\n291\n00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.460\npoint and check what you want, hit do it\nand generates the actual file for you.\n\n292\n00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.230\nSo very very simple, but once we've got\nthat file which is really the bulk of\n\n293\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.330\nthe work then we use our Power Shell\nagain to then import that file.\n\n294\n00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.200\n>> That's it.\n\n295\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.160\nSo once you have this file ready and\nyou've got all the information,\n\n296\n00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.285\nnow I want you to take a look\nat the file just briefly,\n\n297\n00:16:42.285 --> 00:16:45.920\ncuz I did this on purpose cuz this\nis what you might also find out.\n\n298\n00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.270\nLet's say that Daniel and I are not the\nonly ones actually generating these files.\n\n299\n00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.770\nLet's say that we even have another\nadmin that's actually gonna be\n\n300\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.510\nthe one that adds all\nthis stuff in here too.\n\n301\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.620\nSo what can happen is when\nyou generate these files,\n\n302\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.560\nit's sorta like something\nthat you'll see here.\n\n303\n00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.010\nSome of them do have so there's a couple\nof them that do have this account skew ID\n\n304\n00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.950\nand notice that there's some\nof them that do not as well.\n\n305\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.850\nSo it may be where at\ndifferent times right,\n\n306\n00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:15.400\nsomebody generates a .csv file and\nthey include everything.\n\n307\n00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.140\nSometimes because the person goes\nno I know exactly what I need to\n\n308\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.710\nget Office 365 ready that they're\nonly generating that bare minimum.\n\n309\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.420\nAnd then you're going to realize later on\nthat stuff has to be added in as well.\n\n310\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.020\nSo at this point all we want\nto do is add users in but\n\n311\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.230\nI wanted you to see that we can add them\nin regardless of whether we have every\n\n312\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.080\nfield filled out or not right now.\n\n313\n00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.660\nBut then we can go back on later\nin just a little bit of time here.\n\n314\n00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:45.230\nAnd be able to actually add in\nmore information as we need to.\n\n315\n00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.100\nSo just kind of realize this is may be\nsomething that ends up happening but once\n\n316\n00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.210\nyou get this file generated and that's all\nthe information that you need in there.\n\n317\n00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:59.360\nWe want to be able now of course then to\nadd them into the Office 365 account.\n\n318\n00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.280\nSo inside of that particular field, so\nthat you know that I'm not tricking you,\n\n319\n00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.580\nI have Tyler, Thomas, Titus, and\nMegan and even Jason added in there.\n\n320\n00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.480\nI want to verify that I don't have\nthose accounts sitting in there.\n\n321\n00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.250\nAnd so I have Jason's account, let me go\nahead and get rid of Jason's account or\n\n322\n00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.140\nit's gonna kinda balk at me for\nright now, so let me delete him.\n\n323\n00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:19.810\nRight there.\n\n324\n00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.860\nAnd I'll delete him out of there.\n\n325\n00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.810\nSo that way we have everybody else and\n\n326\n00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:30.590\nI'm now going to add in that\nlist using Power Shell instead.\n\n327\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.440\nSo if I wanted to be able to do that.\n\n328\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.780\nFrom the Power Shell line,\n\n329\n00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.160\nwhat is the first thing that we need\nto make sure that we can do, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.980\nWell, we need to be able to go ahead and\nuse that particular list.\n\n331\n00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.730\nAnd what we're gonna do is,\n\n332\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:49.050\nwe're gonna assign it to a variable\nright now as well, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.160\nSo, when I want to create this list here.\n\n334\n00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.790\nOkay?\n\n335\n00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.190\nA couple of things that we can do.\n\n336\n00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:58.390\nLet me do it this way.\n\n337\n00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.560\nI'm going to go ahead and\ndo this called users.\n\n338\n00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.980\nSo I'm gonna create a variable\ncalled users, put an equal sign.\n\n339\n00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.700\nAnd then we're gonna import that CSV file.\n\n340\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:13.870\nAlright.\n\n341\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:18.520\nThen I need to tell it where that file's\ngonna be located on my hard drive here.\n\n342\n00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.650\nAnd this is where the tab\nfill really does help me out.\n\n343\n00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.250\nAnd this is gonna be the one\ncalled powershell-bulk.\n\n344\n00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.500\nSo these are actually\ngonna be my users here.\n\n345\n00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.030\nAnd so now that's gonna be\nimported into that variable.\n\n346\n00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.390\nAnd now we're gonna take that list and\nadd that into Office 365.\n\n347\n00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:45.730\nSo this is where we call\nupon that variable again.\n\n348\n00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.220\nAnd I did call it user instead of users,\nwhich is the way I had it.\n\n349\n00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.248\nAnd now I need to run through here.\n\n350\n00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:55.390\nFor each object and\n\n351\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.380\nthen I open these fancy brackets here,\ncurly braces.\n\n352\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:05.680\nAnd I tell it I'm gonna\ngenerate a new MSOL user.\n\n353\n00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.888\nAnd it's here that I can\nadd in my display name.\n\n354\n00:20:19.846 --> 00:20:24.310\nAnd then I'm gonna also add in\nthe first name of my users.\n\n355\n00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.971\nSo these are the fields that\nI do have in that file.\n\n356\n00:20:30.971 --> 00:20:32.097\nAnd then the last name.\n\n357\n00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:42.429\nAnd let's see, what else do I have here?\n\n358\n00:20:42.429 --> 00:20:43.721\nI have the user principal name.\n\n359\n00:20:48.097 --> 00:20:50.721\nAnd then that, oops.\n\n360\n00:20:57.805 --> 00:21:02.804\nAnd then lastly,\nI have the usage location.\n\n361\n00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.638\nUsage location.\n\n362\n00:21:14.512 --> 00:21:18.014\nAll right, so\nonce we actually get all that set up and\n\n363\n00:21:18.014 --> 00:21:22.480\nI need to add that into Office 365,\njust press enter from here.\n\n364\n00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.500\nHopefully, I think I pressed enter.\n\n365\n00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.804\nAnd in a moment it should generate and\ntell me, unless I didn't press enter.\n\n366\n00:21:31.387 --> 00:21:34.270\nWe'll see here in a moment,\nand see what happens.\n\n367\n00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.598\nSo, if I don't get a bunch of red letters\nit should end up taking its place and\n\n368\n00:21:37.598 --> 00:21:38.846\nwe should get a prompt back.\n\n369\n00:21:38.846 --> 00:21:43.204\nSo it might just be taking a moment\nas it actually has to add those users\n\n370\n00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:45.470\nin to the Office 365 directory.\n\n371\n00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:49.762\nAll right.\n\n372\n00:21:51.888 --> 00:21:53.762\n>> [LAUGH] We haven't gotten an error,\nyet.\n\n373\n00:21:53.762 --> 00:21:55.180\n>> Oh, you wanna know what I did?\n\n374\n00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.680\nI know what I did here.\n\n375\n00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.360\nIt's not that, it's a mistake on my part.\n\n376\n00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.040\nI don't need a user equals,\nbecause that's silly.\n\n377\n00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.460\nI need this to actually\nbe something else here.\n\n378\n00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.440\nLet's try that, there we go.\n\n379\n00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.480\nSo my problem again, typos.\n\n380\n00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.170\nI'm the king of typos, I will absolutely\nnever tell you anything different here.\n\n381\n00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:18.876\nBut there it is.\n\n382\n00:22:18.876 --> 00:22:22.080\nNotice that you actually did see it\nhappen right here, if it weren't for\n\n383\n00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.650\nmy typo like,\nwhat the heck is going on here?\n\n384\n00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:25.540\nIt was right there.\n\n385\n00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.220\nI was looking like,\n\n386\n00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.360\nwhy does that look strange,\nit's because I needed to pipe that in.\n\n387\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.560\nI took the contents of that\nfile that I imported in, and\n\n388\n00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.270\nthen I actually made it create each of\nthese objects inside of the Power Shell.\n\n389\n00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:42.010\nAnd notice, it actually did create these\ngeneric passwords that are generated,\n\n390\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.810\ndisplay name, and\nof course user principle name.\n\n391\n00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.630\nI did not assign them\nany licenses right now.\n\n392\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.140\nSo, let me take a look here.\n\n393\n00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.330\nAnd let's take a look now.\n\n394\n00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.060\nOkay.\n\n395\n00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.100\nSo here it is,\nback inside the Office 365 admin center,\n\n396\n00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.550\nyou actually notice that\nthose names don't appear.\n\n397\n00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:06.320\nIf I go ahead and refresh here, I should\nnow see all those names we add in.\n\n398\n00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.950\nThere's Megan's name, there's Jason,\nThomas, and Titus and Rob's name.\n\n399\n00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.120\nI can't remember if she added Rob's,\nI can't remember if I did that or not.\n\n400\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.410\nBut those names are now\nadded in to the office 365.\n\n401\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.090\nThrough the Power Shell.\n\n402\n00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.480\nSo you saw where some of them\ndid have licenses in it, and\n\n403\n00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.840\nthese actually did not.\n\n404\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.950\nIt didn't like it when I,\nactually I know what I did,\n\n405\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:33.580\nI forget to actually add in that last\nlittle dash, which should have been\n\n406\n00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.270\ndash add license and then something else,\nbut that's the reason I didn't add it in.\n\n407\n00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.920\nSo if I would've remembered\nthat it would've helped,\n\n408\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.200\nbut we can actually do that a little\nbit later on if we need to.\n\n409\n00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.520\nSo here it is.\n\n410\n00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.020\nWe can bulk add in users,\n\n411\n00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.236\nand you can see why this is something\nthat's fairly effective for us,\n\n412\n00:23:50.236 --> 00:23:55.398\nto be able to do this all at one time when\nthere's hundreds, thousands of users here.\n\n413\n00:23:55.398 --> 00:23:57.430\nIt can take a little bit of time.\n\n414\n00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.672\nWith the five that I did here,\n\n415\n00:23:58.672 --> 00:24:01.418\nyou saw where it actually did kinda\nfill it in a little bit slowly.\n\n416\n00:24:01.418 --> 00:24:05.284\nBut at the same time, being able to\nactually add those things in there\n\n417\n00:24:05.284 --> 00:24:09.417\nreally does help speed up things cause\nyou're not having to go through and\n\n418\n00:24:09.417 --> 00:24:12.310\nclick on everything and\ndo this and do that.\n\n419\n00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:17.610\nNow it's all in there and we are actually\nready for us to, to then move on and\n\n420\n00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:21.660\ndo some other things here, but we can see\nwhy this is so much more efficient at this\n\n421\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.460\npoint than what we're normally\ndoing inside that admin center.\n\n422\n00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.590\n>> Yeah, this really becomes advantageous\nwhen you have, you know,Ronnie added a few\n\n423\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.630\nusers here, not a big deal,\nyou could have done that user by user, but\n\n424\n00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.310\nit's when you have 20, 30,\n50, 100, 200 and beyond.\n\n425\n00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:41.570\nThat's when this really starts making\nit's money, and this isn't the only\n\n426\n00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:46.090\nways that you can do the bulk, the things\nwith powershell into Office 365.\n\n427\n00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:50.840\nWe created users but\nwe can also do property additions or\n\n428\n00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.040\neven manager's license keys.\n\n429\n00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.590\nRight Ronnie?\n>> We really can and\n\n430\n00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.460\nI actually continue to go on and do that.\n\n431\n00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.460\nNow as we actually start taking\na look at things like that where\n\n432\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.510\nthere may be fields like we talked about\nwhere it didn't actually fill in anything.\n\n433\n00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:08.070\nIt does allow us to take the opportunity\nand time to create more of these variables\n\n434\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:11.160\nto ensure that we can actually\ndo that a little bit more.\n\n435\n00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.140\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n436\n00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.230\ntake a look at this one other thing\nthat we want to be able to do.\n\n437\n00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.150\nLet's say that what ends up happening\nhere is that we wanted to add in\n\n438\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:24.500\njust a couple of more fields here, okay?\n\n439\n00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:30.360\nSo I went in and created this CSV file\nwhere let's say that I realized something.\n\n440\n00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.620\nI wanted to add in the title,\nas well as the department too,\n\n441\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.340\nsome of the users that we have.\n\n442\n00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.010\nOkay.\n\n443\n00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.370\nSo that wasn't included in\nthe original import, but\n\n444\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.590\nwhat I don't wanna do is I don't\nwanna recreate a new user,\n\n445\n00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.770\nright, to give them and\ngenerate a new object ID for them.\n\n446\n00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:50.570\nI wanna take this information that I have,\nessentially the title and\n\n447\n00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:55.400\nthe department, and\nupdate those fields inside of Office 365.\n\n448\n00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.850\nSo if we take a look here for\nexample on Megan's account, and\n\n449\n00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:05.450\nI click edit,\nit's right here that if I scroll down.\n\n450\n00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:09.830\nSee what I can scroll down here,\nunder additional details, that there is.\n\n451\n00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:14.010\nThere's job title, and there's department\n,and notice it's not filled in here, and\n\n452\n00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:17.180\nlet's say we wanted to start doing this to\nsome of those users that had missed it.\n\n453\n00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.790\nNow, don't get me wrong, I'm just doing\nthis as an example, but you can see where\n\n454\n00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.070\nyou needed that information\nlater on you can go back in and\n\n455\n00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:29.820\nfill it in here instead of picking every\nindividual that you think didn't get it,\n\n456\n00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.710\nand actually having to add this step.\n\n457\n00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.650\nSo we're gonna kind of follow the same\npattern that we did the last time, which\n\n458\n00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:41.510\nis creating that basic variable and then\ncalling on it in a script to help us out.\n\n459\n00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.930\nSo this time,\nwe're gonna add in the user info.\n\n460\n00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.040\nNow don't put a dash there.\n\n461\n00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.160\nFor some reason when you\ncreate these variables,\n\n462\n00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.200\nit doesn't like the use of dashes instead,\nand you can name it whatever you want to,\n\n463\n00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.810\nbut I'm just gonna do user_info, and\nthen we're gonna do the same thing.\n\n464\n00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:04.009\nWe're gonna import a CSV file, and mine's\nactually all in the same location here.\n\n465\n00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.600\nIs on the desktop of the administrator,\nand\n\n466\n00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.430\nthis one is going to be\nupdate_user_properties doing this here.\n\n467\n00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:18.550\nSo we're actually being able to bulk\nupdate user properties doing this here.\n\n468\n00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:22.206\nSo now that I've created that variable,\nI can call on that variable again.\n\n469\n00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:28.541\nAnd this time I'm gonna pipe\nit into another command,\n\n470\n00:27:28.541 --> 00:27:33.180\nand this one is actually going\nto run through each, oops!\n\n471\n00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:38.184\nJust like we did before, and so\n\n472\n00:27:38.184 --> 00:27:42.995\nI need a set of parenthesis and\n\n473\n00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:50.308\nthen I'm gonna have those curly braces,\nand\n\n474\n00:27:50.308 --> 00:27:57.058\nwe are now going to set for\neach MSOL user.\n\n475\n00:27:57.058 --> 00:28:01.430\nThe UserPrincipalName and\n\n476\n00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:08.844\nthat's got a $_.UserPrincipalName, and\n\n477\n00:28:08.844 --> 00:28:18.348\nthen Department Dollar_.Department\nthen dash Title and\n\n478\n00:28:18.348 --> 00:28:22.539\nthe same thing once more.\n\n479\n00:28:26.497 --> 00:28:32.570\n-title, close those curly braces and\nthen close out of my parenthesis here.\n\n480\n00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:37.590\nSo then, when I do that, if I've typed in\neverything correctly I press enter here,\n\n481\n00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.810\nand now it actually has done nothing.\n\n482\n00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.340\nYou're probably saying it\ndidn't show anything here.\n\n483\n00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.626\nWell the good thing is the results\nare actually inside of my admin console.\n\n484\n00:28:47.626 --> 00:28:54.700\nInstead, I refresh now and then I'm\ngonna select Megan's name again and\n\n485\n00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.910\nclick Edit, and when I do, I scroll down,\n\n486\n00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.700\nselect Additional Details, and\nnow notice there it is job title director.\n\n487\n00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.030\nShe's part of the production team and\nthis allows us to continue to update.\n\n488\n00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:13.160\nNot exactly the hardest thing in\nthe world, until you have 100 users and\n\n489\n00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.170\nyou go in there and you're saying\nhey all these fields are missing.\n\n490\n00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:21.760\nI'd rather get them all pulled in\nfrom active director in one file and\n\n491\n00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.400\nthen being able to actually pull\nthem into that one CSV file.\n\n492\n00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.040\nRun a script just like we did, and\nthat actually adds them in and\n\n493\n00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.700\nstarts creating all of the accounts the\nway that I need to inside of Office 365.\n\n494\n00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.600\nIt is a really neat thing for\nus to be able to do.\n\n495\n00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.100\n>> That's right.\nThere's obviously a lot of power inside,\n\n496\n00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.480\nwell, the PowerShell.\n\n497\n00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.730\nI guess it's so aptly named.\n\n498\n00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.250\nRyan, is there anything else\nthat we need to cover as far as\n\n499\n00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.890\nPowerShell administration?\n\n500\n00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:46.750\nCapabilities go?\n\n501\n00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.020\n>> Well, there's a couple of other things\nthat we can actually do here, right?\n\n502\n00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.900\nSo once we now know how\nto create the actual\n\n503\n00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.890\nusers that we actually want to create.\n\n504\n00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:58.170\nWe actually know how to\nupdate them as well.\n\n505\n00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:02.650\nWhat about those licenses that we're\nactually missing at this particular point?\n\n506\n00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.730\nSo, when we take a look\nat something like that,\n\n507\n00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:08.050\nwe can still add those\nfeatures in there too.\n\n508\n00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:08.630\nOkay.\n\n509\n00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.540\nSo when we take a look at the idea here,\n\n510\n00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.210\nwe're talking about bulk\nlicense management as well.\n\n511\n00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:17.820\nSo remember that there were a few\naccounts that had previously shown you\n\n512\n00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.520\nwhere they are not actually licensed here.\n\n513\n00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.205\nSo let me take a look at how many\nlicenses that I have available to me.\n\n514\n00:30:27.455 --> 00:30:31.536\nSo the key words here of course\nis Get -MsolAccountSku, and\n\n515\n00:30:31.536 --> 00:30:36.176\nwhen I do that, I can actually see\nthat I have seven of them consumed,\n\n516\n00:30:36.176 --> 00:30:38.896\nand then there's 25 active units, so\n\n517\n00:30:38.896 --> 00:30:44.290\nthat means you have to do a subtraction,\nit's fairly easy for us, right?\n\n518\n00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.510\nSo on this one that means I have-\n>> 42.\n\n519\n00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.031\n>> 42, yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n520\n00:30:48.031 --> 00:30:51.040\n>> 18 no licenses that are actually\n\n521\n00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.740\navailable to me if I added in correctly,\nor subtracted correctly.\n\n522\n00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.580\nI have 18 that are available.\n\n523\n00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:01.670\nSo how do I find out who is\nactually gonna be available, and\n\n524\n00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.450\nwhat can I do with that\nparticular user if I have that?\n\n525\n00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:12.450\nSo the way I do that is\nI do a get-msol user and\n\n526\n00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:17.500\nthen a -all for all of their attributes\nthat I want to discover as well but\n\n527\n00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:23.060\nI'm actually only looking for\nthe unlicensed users only.\n\n528\n00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.280\nNow I don't have to do that all but\nthere's a couple of attributes that I need\n\n529\n00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.520\nto make sure that are pulled up before we\ngo forward I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n530\n00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.540\ncall them all up for right now.\n\n531\n00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:36.160\nSo here it is, here are the ones that\nhave no licenses, and you can see\n\n532\n00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.490\nthat right now it actually does say that\nit's false at this particular point.\n\n533\n00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:44.820\nSo when we take a look at all of\nthose that are actually pulled up,\n\n534\n00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.320\nI want to be able to assign\neach of those licenses, or\n\n535\n00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.330\none of those licenses then To these\nunits that I have that are available.\n\n536\n00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:56.810\nSo if I count this up, one, two,\nthree, four, five, six, seven.\n\n537\n00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.164\nI'm not gonna worry about\nthe sync admin right now.\n\n538\n00:31:59.164 --> 00:32:01.821\nI can change that a little\nbit later on if I need to.\n\n539\n00:32:01.821 --> 00:32:05.652\nBut let's just go ahead and\nassign them all licenses For right now.\n\n540\n00:32:05.652 --> 00:32:11.933\nSo I need to call up that same,\nget the actual, all of these licenses,\n\n541\n00:32:11.933 --> 00:32:18.010\nand then we're gonna pipe that into,\nsomething else here, okay.\n\n542\n00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:25.240\nSo I'm gonna Set-MsolUserLicense.\n\n543\n00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:30.780\nAnd then do a -AddLicenses here.\n\n544\n00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.600\nNow this is where it becomes\na little bit trickier, okay?\n\n545\n00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:39.460\nWhich is, we need to be able to get this\nname, it's the AccountSkuID, down here.\n\n546\n00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:45.432\nSo I'm just gonna type it in, Quotes,\nI couldn't remember what I was gonna say.\n\n547\n00:32:45.432 --> 00:32:52.160\nSo it's itprotvdemo:ENTERPRISE,\n\n548\n00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:59.727\nif I spelled it right, ENTERPRISEPACK and\n\n549\n00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:04.782\nthen close the quotes here.\n\n550\n00:33:04.782 --> 00:33:07.962\nAnd then I simply press Return.\n\n551\n00:33:07.962 --> 00:33:13.846\nAnd now,\noh it's actually saying I need the usage\n\n552\n00:33:13.846 --> 00:33:18.620\nparameter for, okay, let me see here.\n\n553\n00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.845\nI told her to get all\nthe licenses that we needed.\n\n554\n00:33:25.342 --> 00:33:28.880\nUnlicensed only, verify my typing here.\n\n555\n00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.820\nWhat I just did is I ran the Get-MsolUser\n-all -UnlicensedOnly, and\n\n556\n00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.606\nnotice what happened is that\nit actually went ahead and\n\n557\n00:33:37.606 --> 00:33:41.331\nassigned all the other licenses except for\nthis one.\n\n558\n00:33:41.331 --> 00:33:45.260\nAnd the reason why this one did not\nactually get assigned is that it\n\n559\n00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.706\ndidn't like the usage location\nwhich I didn't set any.\n\n560\n00:33:48.706 --> 00:33:53.377\nSo all the rest of the groups, right,\nbecause of the way that licensing works,\n\n561\n00:33:53.377 --> 00:33:56.531\nthe licensing is also done\nper user location as well.\n\n562\n00:33:56.531 --> 00:34:00.123\nAnd because this one account didn't\nhave it, and all these other ones did,\n\n563\n00:34:00.123 --> 00:34:03.910\ninside the United States, it assigned\nthem licenses but not this one.\n\n564\n00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:08.210\nSo there's times when you may get\nerrors that look exactly like this, but\n\n565\n00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.400\nnotice that it did work.\n\n566\n00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.470\nHere's the original list right up here\nat the top that we just ran through and\n\n567\n00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:15.960\nI said that we're gonna\nassign this anyways.\n\n568\n00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.830\nAnd then when I tried to run it,\nit actually did work, but\n\n569\n00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:23.460\nI was kinda worried about it because\nit said this usage location.\n\n570\n00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.590\nAnd I just didn't remember\nhaving to deal with that.\n\n571\n00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.500\nBut when I tried to confirm it to\nsee if it actually assigned any or\n\n572\n00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.630\nnot, you can now see where it actually\ndid assign all those other licenses.\n\n573\n00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:37.340\nSo sometimes warnings are not\nexactly show stoppers.\n\n574\n00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.920\nA lot of times you just have to take a\nlook and see if it logically makes sense.\n\n575\n00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.559\nAnd I remembered we just created this user\naccount at the beginning of the show,\n\n576\n00:34:44.559 --> 00:34:46.040\nI didn't set a usage location.\n\n577\n00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:46.958\nAnd now it's saying,\n\n578\n00:34:46.958 --> 00:34:50.010\nlook, if you don't have that, how do\nI know what license to assign to you?\n\n579\n00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:50.961\nIf you're in the States,\n\n580\n00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:53.613\nremember you'll have an end user\nlicense agreement that will be there.\n\n581\n00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:56.540\nIf you're over in some other country,\nin the European Union,\n\n582\n00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.154\nit'll also be some other one too.\n\n583\n00:34:58.154 --> 00:35:02.460\nWithout anything set here, it just says,\nthere's no way I'm assigning a license, so\n\n584\n00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.370\nthat's why I ended up with\nthe result that we did.\n\n585\n00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:10.310\nSo setting something like that up\nactually really does help us out to\n\n586\n00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.030\nbe able to get those licenses.\n\n587\n00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.510\nAgain, other information that may be\nmissing, but notice that this one,\n\n588\n00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.330\nthe syntax changed, right?\n\n589\n00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:22.640\nInstead of that just Set-MsolUserLicense,\nwe also had to go ahead and\n\n590\n00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:27.820\nset up the MSOL user license instead,\nand that's a key term.\n\n591\n00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.260\nI know it's a lot of terminology, but\nremember if you're getting ready for\n\n592\n00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.530\nthe exam, there is a difference\nbetween just setting that user and\n\n593\n00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.500\nsetting the licenses there too.\n\n594\n00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.430\nThere's only one other thing\nwe need to do, Daniel, and\n\n595\n00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.660\nthat is the idea of deleting accounts too.\n\n596\n00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.190\n>> That's right, give them the old axe,\nit's time to go,\n\n597\n00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.920\nyou've been fired or you've quit.\n\n598\n00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.480\nOr, for whatever reason, you are no longer\nin my system, I don't need you there.\n\n599\n00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.640\nIt's time to delete users.\n\n600\n00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.389\nNow, we talked about deleting users,\n\n601\n00:35:53.389 --> 00:35:57.370\nespecially when it came to the admin\nportal, right, doing it through the GUI.\n\n602\n00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.700\nAnd Ronnie, if I remember correctly,\nit deletes but it doesn't actually delete.\n\n603\n00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.202\nIt kind of hangs around for\na little while,\n\n604\n00:36:03.202 --> 00:36:05.010\njust in case you need to bring them back.\n\n605\n00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.480\nBut we wanna talk about,\nI want this guy gone,\n\n606\n00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.400\nI want him out of my system,\nI can use PowerShell to make that happen.\n\n607\n00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.085\n>> And that's the only way\nyou can make it happen.\n\n608\n00:36:12.085 --> 00:36:15.800\nSo there's no searching inside\nthe GUI to make it happen.\n\n609\n00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.530\nIf you just selected Delete\nthrough that Admin center,\n\n610\n00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.560\nremember that's gonna be what\nthey consider a soft delete.\n\n611\n00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.791\nAnd that's a key term, you wanna make sure\nthat you do understand those preparing for\n\n612\n00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:27.984\nthe exam, too, okay.\n\n613\n00:36:27.984 --> 00:36:32.205\nSo that means it's essentially gonna\nmove them from where the active users\n\n614\n00:36:32.205 --> 00:36:34.020\nare into the deleted users too.\n\n615\n00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.290\nSo remember that when\nwe take a look at this,\n\n616\n00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.980\nlet me show you what I'm talking\nabout here on my screen.\n\n617\n00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.760\nSo when we actually delete an account,\nright.\n\n618\n00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.960\nSo Active Users are all right here.\n\n619\n00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.910\nAnd earlier in our show, I went ahead and\nI believe I deleted one other one here.\n\n620\n00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.860\nBut I don't actually\nhave any deleted here.\n\n621\n00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.510\nSo, let's go ahead and,\noh actually I have Jason's deleted.\n\n622\n00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.350\nLet's go ahead and\njust add in a couple of others here.\n\n623\n00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.670\nI'm gonna add in Angie and Erin as well.\n\n624\n00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.420\nAnd then I'm just gonna select\nDelete from right here.\n\n625\n00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.460\nNow, remember that what\nwe're talking about, right,\n\n626\n00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.590\nis not being able to move to them\nfrom one location to the other.\n\n627\n00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:13.020\nIn PowerShell, yes there's\na way that you can do that, but\n\n628\n00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.030\nthat's not the point, right.\n\n629\n00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:19.220\nThe point is if we go into the Deleted\nUsers, notice that there isn't,\n\n630\n00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:24.530\neven if I were to check Jason's name here,\nthere isn't actually a link that says hey,\n\n631\n00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.180\ndelete this user from here, okay.\n\n632\n00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.610\nWhat we actually end up getting here\nis just the ability to restore.\n\n633\n00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.970\nIf you now need to say, look,\nI need to delete this, well,\n\n634\n00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.020\nit's only from the PowerShell\nyou can do this.\n\n635\n00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:42.980\nSo let's go ahead and take a look,\nif we were actually doing this too.\n\n636\n00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.700\nNow if you wanted to remove\njust a single one, okay, so\n\n637\n00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:52.030\nlet's do a Get-MsolUser.\n\n638\n00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:57.574\nAnd then I'm gonna actually take a look\n\n639\n00:37:57.574 --> 00:38:02.620\nat here, -ReturnDeletedUsers.\n\n640\n00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:07.449\nAnd so there are my three deleted user\naccounts that I have available to me.\n\n641\n00:38:07.449 --> 00:38:10.489\nAnd so when I take a look at that,\nthat's fine, those are the ones.\n\n642\n00:38:10.489 --> 00:38:14.419\nIf I want to delete a single one,\n\n643\n00:38:14.419 --> 00:38:19.369\nI simply type in Remove-MsolUser, and\n\n644\n00:38:19.369 --> 00:38:22.726\nthen I can do the -return,\n\n645\n00:38:27.649 --> 00:38:30.389\nWell, let me try to actually type this in.\n\n646\n00:38:30.389 --> 00:38:31.749\n>> I have faith in you, Ronnie.\n\n647\n00:38:31.749 --> 00:38:34.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, let me do the -User, so\n\n648\n00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:38.450\nthat I just typed it in wrong,\n-UserPrincipalName.\n\n649\n00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.858\nAnd here we'll do Jason's account,\nis what we'll do.\n\n650\n00:38:42.858 --> 00:38:51.307\nSo jason@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n651\n00:38:51.307 --> 00:38:56.618\nAnd from here I just simply type\nin -RemoveFromRecycleBin and\n\n652\n00:38:56.618 --> 00:38:59.750\nadd in the -force command.\n\n653\n00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.670\nSo this actually says look,\ndon't save it for\n\n654\n00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:05.600\n30 days, just simply remove\nit out of the recycle bin.\n\n655\n00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.260\nSo, that actually does work for us if\nwe were to just remove one at a time.\n\n656\n00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:14.120\nAll right, now what if we actually\nwanted to remove multiple accounts at\n\n657\n00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.460\nthe same time?\n\n658\n00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.650\nSo we can do the same thing,\n-GetMsolUser and\n\n659\n00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.930\ntell it to -ReturnDeletedUsers here.\n\n660\n00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:28.180\nAnd at this point it also depends\non how that many you want to do.\n\n661\n00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:32.637\nBy default if you do this, okay,\nit limits itself to I think\n\n662\n00:39:32.637 --> 00:39:37.470\nthe first 10,000 if you don't\nactually add in anything.\n\n663\n00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:42.024\nBut you can change this by telling it the\nmaximum number you want to delete at any\n\n664\n00:39:42.024 --> 00:39:45.500\none time, and you just say hey,\n-maxresults here.\n\n665\n00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.289\nSo even if you were to do this,\nthis report here,\n\n666\n00:39:48.289 --> 00:39:51.570\nit says hey,\nget the first 10,000 is what it does.\n\n667\n00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:55.442\nAnd if you wanted to limit\nhow many you wanted here,\n\n668\n00:39:55.442 --> 00:40:01.410\nyou could do the -maxresults, well if\nI can spell maxresults, how's that?\n\n669\n00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.960\nAt this point you can actually type in\nthe number, now I don't have anything.\n\n670\n00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.100\nAnd you might be wondering, why in\nthe world would I choose to do that?\n\n671\n00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.250\nIt depends on the limitation of RAM,\nthat's what it comes down to, right.\n\n672\n00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:15.910\nSo if you think about it,\nif you have 20,000 it might slow down your\n\n673\n00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.860\nmachine if you tell it, go and retrieve\neverybody in my recycle bin if you\n\n674\n00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.110\ndeleted that many users out and\nyou put them in the recycle bin here.\n\n675\n00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.200\nBut you wanna make sure you're\nactually deleting those out.\n\n676\n00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.920\nThat's what you can do.\n\n677\n00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:33.080\nAnd then we can pipe that\ninto the Remove-MsolUser.\n\n678\n00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.633\nAnd then we do the same thing,\n\n679\n00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:40.137\n-RemoveFromRecycleBin and\nwe tell it to -force.\n\n680\n00:40:40.137 --> 00:40:44.165\nAnd in a moment here we\nshould get the same result.\n\n681\n00:40:44.165 --> 00:40:47.320\nAnd now you can see that there's\nnobody left in the recycle bin.\n\n682\n00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.820\nSo can you remove a single individual\nuser from the recycle bin?\n\n683\n00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.010\nYou definitely can.\n\n684\n00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.310\nCan you remove bulk users\nfrom the recycle bin?\n\n685\n00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.150\nYou absolutely can as well.\n\n686\n00:40:56.150 --> 00:41:00.788\nSo, when we take a look here, PowerShell\nis very powerful, and hate to say it,\n\n687\n00:41:00.788 --> 00:41:04.235\nwe've really only scratched the surface,\nright?\n\n688\n00:41:04.235 --> 00:41:07.790\nWell, we're just showing you how\nto manage identities by using\n\n689\n00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:12.470\nthe PowerShell here between Office 365 and\neven your on-premises a little bit.\n\n690\n00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:15.523\nBut just kinda realize that these are\ncommands that you're gonna be using over\n\n691\n00:41:15.523 --> 00:41:17.130\nand over again, and that is the key.\n\n692\n00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.970\nYou need to get used to seeing them,\n\n693\n00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:20.670\nespecially if you are getting ready for\nthe exam.\n\n694\n00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.830\n>> That's right,\nawesome stuff, wise words.\n\n695\n00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.360\nListen to the man,\nhe knows what he's talking about.\n\n696\n00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.503\nAnd obviously PowerShell is something\nyou're gonna wanna pick up and\n\n697\n00:41:27.503 --> 00:41:28.520\nthat you will pick up.\n\n698\n00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.380\nThe more you use it,\nthe more ingrained it will become and\n\n699\n00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.690\nit will become like second nature and\nit won't be that big of a deal.\n\n700\n00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.900\nRonnie, thank you so much.\n\n701\n00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.510\nObviously, this is something we all need\nto know as Office 365 administrators or\n\n702\n00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.190\neven, just any kind of Windows\nadministrator of any kind.\n\n703\n00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.210\nVery awesome stuff.\n\n704\n00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:44.080\nThank you for that.\n\n705\n00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.056\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n706\n00:41:45.056 --> 00:41:47.296\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n707\n00:41:47.296 --> 00:41:48.748\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n708\n00:41:48.748 --> 00:41:49.572\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n709\n00:41:49.572 --> 00:41:50.827\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n710\n00:41:50.827 --> 00:41:56.530\n[SOUND]\n\n",

Next, they talk about some items that need to be cleaned up because they might hinder the Office365 deployment and employ some tools like IdFix and ADModify.NET to help with this process.",

ITProTV,\n\n3\n00:00:16.286 --> 00:00:17.950\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.351\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with our Office 365 Identities and\n\n5\n00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:23.608\nRequirements series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:27.740\nJoining me yet again today I have pride\nhim away from his XBox Live account.\n\n7\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.340\nWhere he does his spare time to help\nlend his expertise to this very topic.\n\n8\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.480\nThat's right,\nyou know him and we love him.\n\n9\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.110\nHe's our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.025\nRonnie, welcome back to the show,\nhow you doing today sir?\n\n11\n00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:41.020\n>> I'm doing fine and today we're\ngonna take a look in Office 365.\n\n12\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.410\nWe're talking about now what we call\nof course, directory synchronization.\n\n13\n00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.400\nAnd this is a very important topic for us\nas we continue to move forward towards our\n\n14\n00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.490\ndeployment of Office\n365 into our networks.\n\n15\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.340\nRight now we've really got two separate\nsituations that we have to deal with as\n\n16\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.500\nadministrators.\n\n17\n00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.413\nOne of course, is that onboarding process,\nright, of Office 365.\n\n18\n00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:05.496\nGetting people to buy into it,\ngetting people to actually say yes,\n\n19\n00:01:05.496 --> 00:01:06.960\nwe're ready to use it.\n\n20\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.000\nAnd then my current on-premises\nActive Directory as well\n\n21\n00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.880\nstill needs to be managed,\nstill needs to be maintained.\n\n22\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.490\nAnd so what ends up happening for\nthat company that is right there, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.430\nIn which now you have where\nthe process is beginning to go on.\n\n24\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.390\nPeople are now starting to see that it's a\nlittle bit more complex than just saying,\n\n25\n00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.100\njust sign in to Office 365 and we're fine.\n\n26\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.840\nThen when they do something like that and\nthey're using that, that's fine.\n\n27\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.690\nThen they come back into well,\nthe Active Directory that they know.\n\n28\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.658\nThey start to login with their current\nusername and their credentials as well,\n\n29\n00:01:40.658 --> 00:01:42.090\nand so that's what we have.\n\n30\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.540\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n31\n00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.320\nRight here on my computer I made\na diagram to try to help us out, so\n\n32\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.970\nthat we understand a little bit easier and\na little bit better.\n\n33\n00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.138\nSo let's say that this is our situation\nhere at the itprotvdemo network, right?\n\n34\n00:01:54.138 --> 00:01:57.460\nMy current on-premises\nActive Directory and\n\n35\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.440\neverything is running in the way\nthat it should be, right?\n\n36\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.360\nSo when users are of course using\nthose resources that are there, email,\n\n37\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.760\nmaybe my storage solution\nsomething like SharePoint.\n\n38\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.510\nWhatever it might be, right,\nthey sign on using domain credentials.\n\n39\n00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.300\nPerfectly fine, works great,\nworks the way that we want to.\n\n40\n00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.700\nBut now that we've also added in that\nextra capability of course, of Office 365.\n\n41\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.880\nWhich not only gives us access of\ncourse to the Office Suite, but\n\n42\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.540\nalso things like our OneDrive.\n\n43\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.290\nAlso things like the SharePoint sites that\nwe normally use and things like Skype for\n\n44\n00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.255\nBusiness and everything else that we have.\n\n45\n00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:37.700\nWhat that same user really ends up\nhaving well, a separate sign on.\n\n46\n00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.840\nSo now a single individual identity,\nright, a user that we have.\n\n47\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.820\nNot only is actually on his device,\n\n48\n00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.360\nwhatever it might be in, where there's\na work station inside of the domain.\n\n49\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.690\nOr whether it's actually outside\ndepending on what he needs to access,\n\n50\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.580\nhe has two accounts that\nhe's actually managing.\n\n51\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.650\nAnd Dan, that sounds like\na wonderful thing especially for\n\n52\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.350\nevery single user in my environment,\nright?\n\n53\n00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.605\n>> Oh yeah, yeah, it's just\na dream come true, no, it is not.\n\n54\n00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:07.730\n[LAUGH] Having multiple areas\nin which you have to administer\n\n55\n00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.870\nthat becomes a nightmare.\n\n56\n00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.090\nThe further out you start\nseparating your systems,\n\n57\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.258\nthe more you're going to\nhave to take care of them.\n\n58\n00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:17.210\nThat you've gotta maybe this one, well,\nthis one's different than that one.\n\n59\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.300\nSo getting them all to work\ntogether becomes much,\n\n60\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.840\nmuch more favorable type of environment.\n\n61\n00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.180\nAnd that's really what we're\nstarting to get into right,\n\n62\n00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.220\ntrying to get things to synergize or\nsynchronize right, Ron.\n\n63\n00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.800\n>> Yes, the idea of synergy is a no,\nthat's not what we're really talking about\n\n64\n00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.050\ntoday, but yes you can purchase\nthe book on your way out.\n\n65\n00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.790\nBut now overall though,\nthe goal is really simple.\n\n66\n00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.300\nSo we take a look at this diagram.\n\n67\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.530\nIt's not really much different than\nthe diagram we were just looking at.\n\n68\n00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.510\nInstead of actually having two accounts,\nwhat we want to be able to do for\n\n69\n00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.580\nusers and for everything, right,\nis to unify all of that together.\n\n70\n00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.320\nSo imagine instead of me having to\naccess my e-mail using one account.\n\n71\n00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.180\nAnd then access my Office 365 or\nmy Word product using another account or\n\n72\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.330\nwhatever it might be.\n\n73\n00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.840\nThat what I can do is simply sign on in\none location here and when I do that.\n\n74\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.065\nIt actually not only gives me access here,\nbut also allows for\n\n75\n00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:17.056\nmy access even into some of my\nresources over here as well.\n\n76\n00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:20.850\nNow there's two ways that this\ncan actually be done, right?\n\n77\n00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.260\nSo inside of Office 365 as you're planning\nout how the synchronization is gonna work.\n\n78\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.780\nThere's gonna be two different ways or\nmaybe even three ways that depending on\n\n79\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.980\nhow in depth that you get\nthat you wanna do this.\n\n80\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.170\nOne way is fairly simple, if you're\nonly trying to manage passwords, right?\n\n81\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.700\nYou just want everybody\nto have a single login.\n\n82\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.730\nThat's by far the easiest\nthing that we're gonna do and\n\n83\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.610\npretty much that's the one\nthat we're gonna do.\n\n84\n00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.080\nBut there is gonna come at point in\ntime when you go look, I really am.\n\n85\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.290\nI'm tired of having to mange\nmy Exchange server now.\n\n86\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.250\nI'm gonna assume that Daniel has never\never said that I'm tired of managing\n\n87\n00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.910\nExchange server, I'm pretty sure he has.\n\n88\n00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.180\nBut we wanna move it up to the cloud,\nwell, now we actually can do that, right?\n\n89\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.631\nWith the Office 365 infrastructure\nthat's there, I can say look,\n\n90\n00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:11.578\nlet's just manage everything\nthrough Office 365 as well.\n\n91\n00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.597\nAnd so when we do something like that,\nright?\n\n92\n00:05:13.597 --> 00:05:15.688\nWe wanna be able to sync\nup these directories and\n\n93\n00:05:15.688 --> 00:05:18.790\nnow be able to actually use all\nof the infrastructure there.\n\n94\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.440\nAnd really is not you start relying\nless and less on our on-premises stuff.\n\n95\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.130\nThere's always gonna be\nthings we can't synchronized.\n\n96\n00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.830\nBut when you start doing that where\nyou might have access to just that,\n\n97\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.570\nthat is what we call coexistence, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.520\nIn the idea of coexisting, okay,\n\n99\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.450\nwe're really saying this are gonna be\na simply two different accounts, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.630\nThat will happen for your organization for\nevery user in your organization, but\n\n101\n00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.557\na single sign on.\n\n102\n00:05:44.557 --> 00:05:51.812\nIn other words, what I use to sign on to\nOffice 365, right, ronnie@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n103\n00:05:51.812 --> 00:05:54.320\nI'll use that same username and\npassword and\n\n104\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.450\nthat will sign in to the Active Directory\nup there on Office 365.\n\n105\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.550\nBut then when I come into my organization\nas well, it will automatically sync\n\n106\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.670\nthat information down to my\nlocal Active Directory, right?\n\n107\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.168\nMy on-premises Active Directory and\nmy username and\n\n108\n00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:10.736\npassword will be the same there.\n\n109\n00:06:10.736 --> 00:06:14.570\nBut it's really never the two\nactually end up meeting.\n\n110\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.990\nSo in that way, I can actually have my\nemail account on-premise if I want to.\n\n111\n00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.755\nAnd my same user account\nas far as password and\n\n112\n00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:24.010\nusername goes, it'll still access that.\n\n113\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.570\nI can access Office 365 in\nthe way that I want to and\n\n114\n00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.050\nI might not wanna host my email up there.\n\n115\n00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.910\nAnd that will work in that way.\n\n116\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.290\nBut what if I wanted to move things\nmore and more towards that cloud but\n\n117\n00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.410\nstill have my Active Directory\non-premises stuff for me?\n\n118\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.580\nThat really can't synchronize up there,\n\n119\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.540\nthat's also what is called\nhybrid development too.\n\n120\n00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.580\nWhen you know that there's gonna be\ncertain resource that will never ever\n\n121\n00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.900\nbe up into the cloud or Office 365 and\n\n122\n00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.290\nyou still need the on-premises\nActive Directory.\n\n123\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.190\nAnd then you still have\naccess to Office 365.\n\n124\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.010\nSo making those two decisions,\nwhich one is gonna be,\n\n125\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.130\nis actually going to help you out in\nthe future once you actually decide that.\n\n126\n00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.430\nBut for what we're actually doing is\nthat we just really want to actually do\n\n127\n00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.560\njust the basic synchronization\nto help us out when we do that.\n\n128\n00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.830\nSo of course, like everything else,\nyou might be gone, that's pretty cool.\n\n129\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.230\nWhat tools can we use?\n\n130\n00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.590\nThat's the one that always\nwe jump to you right away.\n\n131\n00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.560\nBut Daniel, a lot of times and\n\n132\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.110\nyou might have done this,\nI know I've done this before.\n\n133\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.440\nIf you can remember,\n\n134\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.560\nlet's say, the first time you ever tried\nto install Microsoft Exchange itself.\n\n135\n00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.680\nYou just simply said hey look,\nit's a program.\n\n136\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.720\nAll I have to do is double-click on it and\nwhat should happen, Daniel?\n\n137\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.700\n>> Usually,\nit launches some sort of a wizard.\n\n138\n00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.470\nYou start clicking next a bunch of times,\n\n139\n00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.720\nmaybe add some information\nthat it asks you.\n\n140\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.730\nQuestions that you go through, if you\nhave that information, you put it in.\n\n141\n00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.430\nAnd by the end of the thing,\n\n142\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.310\nyou should have the software installed and\nit should be working on that server.\n\n143\n00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.411\nAfter that, it's basically just\nadministration at that point.\n\n144\n00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:55.829\n>> Yeah, and but\nsomething with Exchange, right?\n\n145\n00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:59.119\nAll of a sudden it actually goes okay,\nyou're starting to install and\n\n146\n00:07:59.119 --> 00:07:59.913\nthen says, oh!\n\n147\n00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:02.448\nBy the way,\nhere's six things you don't have ready.\n\n148\n00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:03.200\n>> Oh.\n\n149\n00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.660\n[LAUGH]\n>> Here's the six different things that\n\n150\n00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.110\nyou needed to actually do before-\n>> The pre planning.\n\n151\n00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.872\n>> The pre planning.\n\n152\n00:08:08.872 --> 00:08:09.410\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n153\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.820\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n154\n00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.540\nAnd with Office 365 you go, huh, this\nshould be easy, they make a sync tool?\n\n155\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.250\nEverything should work.\n\n156\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.910\nUntil that point, right?\n\n157\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.710\nThe problem that we have is that this\ntool has been in development over years.\n\n158\n00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.380\nAnd so each time it's been in development\nthere, of course, have been more and\n\n159\n00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.110\nmore demands and more and more things\nthat would actually make it work better.\n\n160\n00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.050\nSo, over the years, there's actually been\nthese tools that have added up together.\n\n161\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.290\nAnd now what they're\nactually saying is look,\n\n162\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.680\nhere's some of things that you can do,\nand that's what we need to talk about.\n\n163\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.810\nThe idea of planning this is\nreally gonna help us out.\n\n164\n00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.920\nSo what is the ultimate result\nof sync that we're looking for\n\n165\n00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.080\nis really kind of why we might\nchoose to do the synchronization.\n\n166\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.500\nOr we might say look I\nreally don't need that,\n\n167\n00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.780\nI'm okay with a single\nuser having two sign-ons.\n\n168\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.330\nPerfectly fine,\nit doesn't really matter to me.\n\n169\n00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.480\nBut what I can actually\nexpect if I do this?\n\n170\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.820\nWell, if you choose at some point in time\nthat the very fact that what you actually\n\n171\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:14.040\nwant available to you is that you want to\nbe able to sync up your active directory.\n\n172\n00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.480\nSo if you wanna have\na single sign-on here,\n\n173\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.920\nyou really need to prepare your active\ndirectory to also work as well.\n\n174\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.063\nOnce you do that, what will initially\nend up happening is that it will\n\n175\n00:09:26.063 --> 00:09:31.916\nbegin a synchronization process between\nthe on premises active directory and\n\n176\n00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:36.009\nalso the online active\ndirectory up in office 365.\n\n177\n00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:40.081\nNow when we talk about that idea\nthe very beginning here of coexistence\n\n178\n00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:42.979\nwhere I'm just really using\na single username and\n\n179\n00:09:42.979 --> 00:09:46.290\npassword between them,\nthe neat thing is this.\n\n180\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.748\nIf I end up creating an account on\nmy on premises active directory,\n\n181\n00:09:50.748 --> 00:09:53.466\nit will get created up in Office 365.\n\n182\n00:09:53.466 --> 00:09:57.344\nIf I delete an account on my\non premises active directory,\n\n183\n00:09:57.344 --> 00:10:01.074\nit will also end up deleting\nup in Office 365 as well.\n\n184\n00:10:01.074 --> 00:10:04.839\nSo it can manage it as long as\nthe synchronization tool is there and\n\n185\n00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:06.640\nit is available.\n\n186\n00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.690\nSo those are things that really do help\nus out when we are talking about that.\n\n187\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.160\nBut you really have to actually say hey,\nhere's the goal that I want and\n\n188\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:14.800\nto have in hand.\n\n189\n00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.250\nNow if you go beyond that, right,\nwhen I talked about that hybrid where,\n\n190\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.160\nyou're actually saying look, we're gonna\nactually have on-premise exchange, and\n\n191\n00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.700\nwe're also gonna have Office\n365 Exchange going on and\n\n192\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.640\na whole bunch of other things here, along\nwith SharePoint and some other things.\n\n193\n00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.030\nThat becomes a bit more complicated and\nyou may actually have to get a specialist\n\n194\n00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.110\nto come in a little bit more to help you\nout with some of those intricacies and\n\n195\n00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.610\nthose details of getting\nall that stuff lined up.\n\n196\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.730\nBut the very fact is at\nleast at the very beginning,\n\n197\n00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.060\nyou can get it synced up to what we need.\n\n198\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.200\nBut it also means that we have to pay a\nlittle bit of attention to our on premises\n\n199\n00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.030\nactive directory at the very beginning to\nget that lined up the way that we want to.\n\n200\n00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.510\nSo that's the first thing that we\nwanna do is we wanna talk about\n\n201\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.758\nwhat are some of the things\nthat we might encounter.\n\n202\n00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:01.540\nSo let me kinda give you an example\nof some of the things that we might\n\n203\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.080\nencounter here.\n\n204\n00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.674\nAnd let me switch on over to another\nmachine here and get logged in and\n\n205\n00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:09.860\nwe will kind of just about jump into it.\n\n206\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.930\nSo, here it is.\n\n207\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.120\nI haven't actually got\nanother domain controller up.\n\n208\n00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:20.250\nNow we've been using the ITProTVdemo.com\nand we sync that up in previous episodes.\n\n209\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.600\nGo ahead and take a look at that.\n\n210\n00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.480\nThat is the account that is actually\nsynced up with DNS to work with\n\n211\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.520\nOffice 365 across the internet and\neverything else here, but\n\n212\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.620\non this particular active directory,\nthis is my lab.itpro.tv account instead.\n\n213\n00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.600\nAnd so\nin this particular little subdomain that\n\n214\n00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.760\nI have that's actually\npart of my ITProTV domain.\n\n215\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.920\nWhen I have this, there is no\n\n216\n00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.350\nactual registered DNS for this, so\nit worked inside of my network.\n\n217\n00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.450\nExactly what I needed,\na little test domain.\n\n218\n00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.030\nWorks fine.\n\n219\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.860\nI had user accounts, I have everything\nin here that I need to do testing.\n\n220\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.964\nBut what if this particular domain\nwas only valid internally but\n\n221\n00:12:03.964 --> 00:12:07.688\nnow we're actually talking hey,\nthose users, though,\n\n222\n00:12:07.688 --> 00:12:12.340\nwe're gonna actually also need to\nsync them up to Office 365 as well.\n\n223\n00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.630\nWell, in this particular issue when we\ndo something like this, it becomes much,\n\n224\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:21.270\nI don't want to say much more difficult,\na little bit more difficult to set up.\n\n225\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.030\nBut this is something that\nyou might also end up seeing.\n\n226\n00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:29.091\nSo a lot of times when you have things\nlike this inside of your domain,\n\n227\n00:12:29.091 --> 00:12:33.368\nyou might see instead of your\ndomain name ending in .com,\n\n228\n00:12:33.368 --> 00:12:37.609\nyou might see it ending in .loc,\nL-O-C, or .local.\n\n229\n00:12:37.609 --> 00:12:41.640\nIf you have that, that's not gonna\nbe routable DNS for you anyways, so\n\n230\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.867\nthat actually is valid inside\nyour network but nowhere else.\n\n231\n00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:48.310\nBut what if those accounts actually\nalso need to be changed over and\n\n232\n00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.230\nget access into your Office 365 network?\n\n233\n00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.140\nWell, this is something that you\nhave to be able to set up and do.\n\n234\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.050\nSo, check out your Active Directory and\nsee what happens.\n\n235\n00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.330\nSo let me show you here.\n\n236\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.900\nIn this particular one that\nI have available to me,\n\n237\n00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.860\nif I know that there are no routable\nuser accounts and email addresses here,\n\n238\n00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.820\nthere's a couple of things that\nneed to be done to get that set up.\n\n239\n00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.980\nAnd so, I'm simply going to\nclick on the server manager, and\n\n240\n00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.720\nin the server manager, I'm gonna go\nto tools, and then I'm looking for\n\n241\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.180\nwhat we call active directory domains and\ntrusts.\n\n242\n00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.556\nSo there it is, lab.itpro.tv.\n\n243\n00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:30.070\nLet me see if I can full\nscreen that a little bit more.\n\n244\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.660\nAnd, let's see, let me zoom in on that so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n245\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.160\nOops.\n\n246\n00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.190\nHere.\n\n247\n00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.670\nMake that a little bit larger.\n\n248\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.350\nOkay.\n\n249\n00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:46.660\nNow, when we get here, if this domain\nname isn't really that important,\n\n250\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.410\nand you might actually go, okay,\nthat's fine, we'll switch everybody over.\n\n251\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.330\nIt still takes a little bit of time to\nget everybody switched over to the main\n\n252\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.340\ndomain.\n\n253\n00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.340\nInstead, what you might be able to\ndo is add what we call a UPN suffix.\n\n254\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.258\nSo, if I right click on\nActive Directory Domains and\n\n255\n00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:06.421\nTrusts in this, domain here that has\nno DNS record that is registered\n\n256\n00:14:06.421 --> 00:14:10.890\nout in the public that is routable,\nI can go to properties.\n\n257\n00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.590\nAnd inside of properties,\nthis is what I would add in here.\n\n258\n00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.070\nI would simply need to\nadd in the domain name.\n\n259\n00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:20.750\nAnd mine's gonna to be IT Pro TV demo.\n\n260\n00:14:23.388 --> 00:14:25.030\n.com.\n\n261\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.100\nAnd click Add and click Apply.\n\n262\n00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.586\nNow when I do that, what am I doing?\n\n263\n00:14:29.586 --> 00:14:34.280\nI'm adding in the domain name\nthat Office 365 recognizes,\n\n264\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.780\nthe one that I've gotten Office\n365 to essentially trust into\n\n265\n00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:43.630\nthis particular name that really is\nnot routable on the internet, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.280\nNow, we're not done here, right?\n\n267\n00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.260\nSo at this point, if everything is\nactually done at that point here,\n\n268\n00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.770\nthat actually sets up a little bit of the\nactive directory the way that I need to.\n\n269\n00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.600\nBut that has to be in there.\n\n270\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:01.120\nThen I would need to go to the users and\ncomputers here.\n\n271\n00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.270\nAnd let's see if that actually brings up,\nokay.\n\n272\n00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.790\nAnd now, what I would do for each one of\nthese accounts that I would have set up,\n\n273\n00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.040\nso we'll take Daniel's name at this point.\n\n274\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.907\nIf I right click and go to properties.\n\n275\n00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.563\nIt is right here instead,\n\n276\n00:15:18.563 --> 00:15:24.675\nthat I would look on what the email\naddress would be For Daniel.\n\n277\n00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.260\nInside of Office 365.\n\n278\n00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.780\nNow, I have two choices here, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.480\nSo if I select this and click OK,\n\n280\n00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.750\nthat's pretty much going to do it for\nthat side of the equation that we need.\n\n281\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.900\nEverything is kind of set up.\n\n282\n00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.290\nAs long as everything is also set up on\nOffice 365 for email to be handled and\n\n283\n00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.980\neverything else that we need to.\n\n284\n00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.112\nSo this allows for his name to do that.\n\n285\n00:15:52.112 --> 00:15:54.246\nNow I forgot one other thing here, Daniel.\n\n286\n00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:57.862\nAnd that is I need to change one\nmore thing once it's registered.\n\n287\n00:15:57.862 --> 00:16:01.234\nAnd let me go back to the account here.\n\n288\n00:16:01.234 --> 00:16:05.583\nAnd now in the drop-down notice\nthat I would simply change\n\n289\n00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:09.420\nit right here to itprotvdemo.com and\nthen apply.\n\n290\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:14.340\nSo instead of having to rename the entire\ndomain to go to the part of the IT Pro TV\n\n291\n00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.930\ndemo, now that his actually .tv,\nnow I have changed this account and\n\n292\n00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:23.210\nit should actually start realizing and\nchecking and doing the other things\n\n293\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.570\nif I have the active directory\nsynchronization set up and ready to go.\n\n294\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.420\nAnd it's actually synching up here.\n\n295\n00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.130\nSo if the name is not routable and is not\npart of what Office 365 recognizes but\n\n296\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.480\nit's still a part of my domain and I need\nto add in there, I would do that as well.\n\n297\n00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.550\nNow, there's a couple of\nthings that end up happening.\n\n298\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.200\nDan already has an account\nup in Office 365.\n\n299\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.420\nI've now given him another\naccount down here.\n\n300\n00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.920\nWell, what is going to happen when\nstuff like that happens, right?\n\n301\n00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.280\nIt has actually begin that synchronization\nprocess and when it actually realize that\n\n302\n00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.060\nthis is the same thing there's a couple\nof things that won't happen, right.\n\n303\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:02.180\nWith the synchronization, one of these,\nright, the on-premises or\n\n304\n00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.120\nthe Office 365 account has to\nbe the source of authority.\n\n305\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.750\nIn other words, what's the writeable copy?\n\n306\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:13.060\nIt makes sense, okay, so which one is\nactually gonna change which one here?\n\n307\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:18.070\nSo the way that this ends up working in\nthe very initial synchronization is this.\n\n308\n00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.588\nWe're gonna talk about the tool and\n\n309\n00:17:20.588 --> 00:17:22.420\ntalk about that synchronization\na little bit more.\n\n310\n00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:27.200\nBut the initial synchronization is once\nthe first synchronization happens where\n\n311\n00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.670\nthe on premise active directory sinks\nup to the Office 365 active directory,\n\n312\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:39.660\nOffice 365 Online's active directory hands\nover the authority on to the on-premises.\n\n313\n00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.060\nNow, this actually makes a little\nbit of sense in this way.\n\n314\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.580\nThat means any changes that you do have to\nactually happen from the on-premises side,\n\n315\n00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:53.870\nand that means the read-only copy is\ngonna be on the Office 365 side, as well.\n\n316\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.980\nSo there's a couple of things that end\nup happening in the background when this\n\n317\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.310\nstuff starts going on.\n\n318\n00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.820\nA little bit confusing there, but\n\n319\n00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.260\njust kinda realize that it is something\nthat you'll have to deal with\n\n320\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.610\nwhen you look for why is my password\nnot the same as it once was?\n\n321\n00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.600\nWell, that's because it actually\ntakes the one that it prefers,\n\n322\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.690\nthe Office 365 password,\nand it says, look,\n\n323\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.260\nlet's sync that one down, and then\nmake that the actual source authority.\n\n324\n00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.825\nSo you wanna make an editable change,\n>> Edible changes.\n\n325\n00:18:19.825 --> 00:18:21.950\n[LAUGH]\n>> Edible changes, yeah.\n\n326\n00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.620\nEditable, yeah, you could eat em.\n\n327\n00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.330\nSnack, tasty.\n\n328\n00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:30.270\nBut yes, if you wanna make editable\nchanges, those things that can be done to\n\n329\n00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.580\nDaniel's account, it will have to be\ndone from the on premises side instead.\n\n330\n00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.560\nSo, things that you have to worry\nabout in terms of management\n\n331\n00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.780\nwhen you start planning for some of these.\n\n332\n00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.030\nSo, the way that this session works\nis one of the first things that we\n\n333\n00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.950\nreally have to deal with, and we know\nthat we're going to be dealing with\n\n334\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.570\nthe things like non routable DNS domains.\n\n335\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.730\n>> Now, Ronnie, is there any other hiccups\nor caveats that we need to be aware of\n\n336\n00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:58.510\nthat might hinder us from having a smooth\ntransition into bringing Office 365\n\n337\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.630\ninto our environment before\nwe even start to deploy?\n\n338\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.990\n>> There is always going\nto be stuff like that and\n\n339\n00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.340\nthe reason why is our active\ndirectory has changed over years.\n\n340\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.400\nYears and years.\n\n341\n00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.290\nAnd we've been around for a long time.\n\n342\n00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.470\nThe active directory that first initially\nstarted off really looks nothing\n\n343\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.110\nlike it is now, OK.\n\n344\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.630\nAnd I'd say this tomorrow or\n\n345\n00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.290\ntwo weeks from now it looked\nnothing like it did before.\n\n346\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.100\nAnd you might be wondering\nwell why is that?\n\n347\n00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.790\nIt's very difficult to maintain\nconsistency throughout years and years.\n\n348\n00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:30.320\nI'm going to say that when Daniel\nwas first a junior domain admin he\n\n349\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.590\nprobably took the time to fill in every\none of those little fields that he could,\n\n350\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.805\nmake sure that everything was\npopulated the way that it needed to.\n\n351\n00:19:37.805 --> 00:19:42.580\nProbably included everything like phone\nnumber, addresses and stuff like that.\n\n352\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.330\nDaniel, let's say your most recent,\n\n353\n00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.290\nwhat did it generally include when\nyou had to add in an account?\n\n354\n00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.340\n>> It had an account name.\n\n355\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.040\n[LAUGH] And,\nmaybe a pre Win 3k login as well.\n\n356\n00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.801\nAnd that's basically about it.\n\n357\n00:19:54.801 --> 00:19:55.660\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, well and\n\n358\n00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.991\nthat's what ends up happening, right?\n\n359\n00:19:56.991 --> 00:19:59.650\nIs over the years, things end up changing.\n\n360\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.490\nWe're no longer as careful now.\n\n361\n00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:02.400\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n362\n00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.310\nFor those of you that are just as careful\nas you were then as you are today,\n\n363\n00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.110\nkudos to you, bravo.\n\n364\n00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.170\nOkay?\nBut if you're like me,\n\n365\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.360\nit's like oh User name.\n\n366\n00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.190\nIf I could just give Daniel a letter D,\nthat would work.\n\n367\n00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.520\n>> That's the bare minimum we can get\naway with and actually have a user.\n\n368\n00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You know, that\n\n369\n00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.170\nwould probably be what ends up happening.\n\n370\n00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.800\nBut then mistakes also happen over time,\ntoo, and then you go back and\n\n371\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.540\nyou change some of them.\n\n372\n00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.160\nSometimes you don't change them.\n\n373\n00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.010\nSometimes the information\nis missing on some and\n\n374\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.860\nthe information is there on others.\n\n375\n00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.540\nWell, remember that when we do that\ndirectory synchronization, right?\n\n376\n00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.910\nThere are going to be a few\nfields that we need to make sure\n\n377\n00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.590\nthat we have to clean up.\n\n378\n00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:39.150\nOkay?\n\n379\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.540\nAnd this is where we talk about\ncleaning up existing objects\n\n380\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.330\ninside of active directory to help us out.\n\n381\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.460\nSo, when we take a look at doing this,\nokay,\n\n382\n00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.400\nwithout actually planning on\ncleaning these things up, okay?\n\n383\n00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.490\nWe might end up with problems that we\ndon't actually expect to end up with.\n\n384\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.860\nAnd this can be a show stopper when\nyou start deploying Office 365.\n\n385\n00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.990\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you some of those features.\n\n386\n00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:07.100\nNow, I've moved over to my actual\nIT Pro TV demo domain here.\n\n387\n00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.030\nAnd I just did it because I didn't\nneed to do it on the other one here.\n\n388\n00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.240\nSo what are some of the things\nwe need to take a look at?\n\n389\n00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.578\nWell, let me bring up\nthe server manager again.\n\n390\n00:21:14.578 --> 00:21:18.450\nAnd we will go into the active\ndirectory users and computers and\n\n391\n00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.400\nthen we'll show you some\nof those things here, okay.\n\n392\n00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.160\nSo I'm gonna click on tools and\nthen select active directory users and\n\n393\n00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.810\ncomputers, and here's a couple of\nthings that need to be checked out or\n\n394\n00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:35.630\ncleaned up, I should say before we\nstart to deal with deploying active\n\n395\n00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.880\ndirectory sync for Office 365 Okay?\n\n396\n00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.690\nSo if we know that any of these user\naccounts that we are seeing right here\n\n397\n00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.140\nare going to be signed Office 365 and\n\n398\n00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.990\nalso licenses that we need, we need to\nverify that every user that we are going\n\n399\n00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:56.020\nto do that with of course has a valid and\nunique email address.\n\n400\n00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.860\nNow In Exchange,\nthat's probably gonna happen.\n\n401\n00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.650\nCuz it's not gonna let you get away\nin Exchange with duplicating them,\n\n402\n00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.080\nwhich is great.\n\n403\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.470\nBut there's fields, though,\nthat we have to actually worry about.\n\n404\n00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.940\nSo let me take Daniel's account since\nI've already picked on him already.\n\n405\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.690\nAnd go to properties.\n\n406\n00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.850\nAnd here's all the stuff.\n\n407\n00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.430\nAt the beginning, this is what I\nwas picking on Daniel about, right?\n\n408\n00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.910\nSo, at the beginning, we probably\ndid fill in a lot of this stuff,\n\n409\n00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.310\naddress tabs,\naccount profile and you name it.\n\n410\n00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:25.060\nBut I am looking for this attribute\neditor, is what I am looking for.\n\n411\n00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.160\nAnd there are few things in here\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n412\n00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.523\nSo if I scroll down here, we are looking\nfor where it says proxy addresses,\n\n413\n00:22:32.523 --> 00:22:34.130\nis what we are looking for.\n\n414\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.620\nSo I am going to scroll the way down and\nget down here and\n\n415\n00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:42.047\nnotice there is it,\nDaniel@ITProTVdemoSMTP.\n\n416\n00:22:42.047 --> 00:22:44.660\nWe see that right there, okay.\n\n417\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.950\nWe need to verify that that is a valid and\na unique email address right there.\n\n418\n00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.250\nMakes sense, okay?\n\n419\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.820\nRemember that email also is not\ngonna have special characters so\n\n420\n00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.920\nif somebody accidentally puts a little\nsingle tick mark in there by accident\n\n421\n00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.030\nIt will also show up and that can cause\nsome stoppage inside of Active Directory.\n\n422\n00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:06.960\nWe also wanna make sure that there\nis no possibility of a duplicate\n\n423\n00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.790\nemail address somewhere else,\nokay, in which that happens too.\n\n424\n00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.640\nSo we wanna make sure that we do that.\n\n425\n00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.570\nSo we wanna remove any possibility\nof duplicate values in this\n\n426\n00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.750\nproxy address attribute.\n\n427\n00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.650\nYou also want to ensure that\nthe user principal name\n\n428\n00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.770\nis also going to be a valid\nuser principal name.\n\n429\n00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.790\nSo, if I scroll down, and\nlet me see if I can find this.\n\n430\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.420\nI've typed enough, there it is.\n\n431\n00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.390\nThere is the user principal name.\n\n432\n00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.410\nAnd you can see that it is valid\nin the way that we want it to.\n\n433\n00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.580\nAnd then, as we continue on,\n\n434\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.040\nthere's a few other things that you\nmight want to actually be able to do.\n\n435\n00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.720\nBut those are kind of the big ones.\n\n436\n00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.470\nThere are a few more and\nI'm just pointing just a few of them out.\n\n437\n00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.003\nSo it's not like you just go and go,\nyeah, I think it has everything.\n\n438\n00:23:51.003 --> 00:23:55.430\nSo a lot of times, your active directory\nwill fill in all that stuff and exchange.\n\n439\n00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.448\nWe'll fill all that in.\n\n440\n00:23:56.448 --> 00:23:57.868\nYou don't have to worry about it.\n\n441\n00:23:57.868 --> 00:24:00.674\n>> But remember there may be\nusers that you added in before.\n\n442\n00:24:00.674 --> 00:24:01.852\nMaybe users you added in afterwards.\n\n443\n00:24:01.852 --> 00:24:05.781\nMaybe you changed some things, and all of\nsudden some things got messed up here.\n\n444\n00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:07.913\nAccounts that got deleted and\nthen added back in,\n\n445\n00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:09.920\nthings might have changed over time.\n\n446\n00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.880\nWhatever it is, it can cause some\nobjects to essentially be created in\n\n447\n00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.700\nactive directory that\ncan cause some issues.\n\n448\n00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.815\nNow, I went ahead and\nI modified a few of mine so\n\n449\n00:24:18.815 --> 00:24:22.090\nthat it would not actually produce\nperfect results when we do this.\n\n450\n00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:23.480\nYou might say, well, Ronny,\nwhy would you break it?\n\n451\n00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.020\nYou wouldn't.\n\n452\n00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.515\nNormally, you wouldn't break it.\n\n453\n00:24:25.515 --> 00:24:26.700\nOkay?\nBut overall,\n\n454\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.650\nthough, those are things\nyou have to check.\n\n455\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.920\nRonny, you said we have to check them for\nevery user?\n\n456\n00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.560\nYeah.\nYou really do.\n\n457\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.760\nEverybody that you're gonna sign up in\nOffice 365, you want to run these checks\n\n458\n00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.520\non or they're probably not gonna\nhave the best experience possible.\n\n459\n00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.420\nSo, Daniel, doesn't that sound fun?\n\n460\n00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.204\n>> Well, you brew some coffee, right?\n\n461\n00:24:45.204 --> 00:24:47.706\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You get some No Doz.\n\n462\n00:24:47.706 --> 00:24:49.620\nNo.\nThat is not gonna happen.\n\n463\n00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.960\nUsually, when it comes down\nto something as intensive as\n\n464\n00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.500\nthis type of activity is going to be,\nthankfully, the powers that be,\n\n465\n00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.040\nthe people that create the software,\nrealized that that would be a job that\n\n466\n00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.331\nwould probably have you questioning\nyour career choice at that point.\n\n467\n00:25:04.331 --> 00:25:06.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So they try to help you out with that.\n\n468\n00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.300\nAnd, Ronnie,\nthey've done that here as well.\n\n469\n00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.170\nAnd they've done a really\ngood job with it.\n\n470\n00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:10.730\n>> They really have.\n\n471\n00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.600\nThere's, essentially, a couple of\ndifferent tools that you and I can use.\n\n472\n00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.650\nAnd it really is gonna save you sanity\nmore than anything else, right?\n\n473\n00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:25.570\nWhen you're really looking for something\nthat specific, right, valid first, right?\n\n474\n00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.950\nValid and\nunique in every one of these things.\n\n475\n00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.840\nThat means you have to actually\nunderstand what valid means, right?\n\n476\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.100\nWhat are some of the characters\nthat can be in these things?\n\n477\n00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.130\nWhat are some of\nthe characters that can't be?\n\n478\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:41.940\nUnique, of course, what if you have two\nJohn Smiths in your active directory?\n\n479\n00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:46.690\nAnd then, you didn't realize it, and now\nyou have two John Smith's email accounts.\n\n480\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:47.870\nGood thing the Exchange will probably say,\n\n481\n00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.050\noh, this has already been used,\nlet me do this.\n\n482\n00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:54.660\nBut, looking at John Smith and\nthen his middle initial is L,\n\n483\n00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.350\nand then you have one that\nactually has a one beside it,\n\n484\n00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.520\nnow all of a sudden you're like, oh,\nyeah, that may be a little bit tricky.\n\n485\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.960\nSo, there are some things like that\nthat you'll have to deal with.\n\n486\n00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.520\nBut the good thing is there's\na couple of these tools.\n\n487\n00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.270\nThe first one is something that also\npresented in another episode but\n\n488\n00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.160\nit's actually something\nwe can run through now.\n\n489\n00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.015\nOne that's called IdFix.\n\n490\n00:26:12.015 --> 00:26:12.970\nOkay?\n\n491\n00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.630\nIdFix is a tool that you can download.\n\n492\n00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.670\nAnd this is the one that\nwill really help you out,\n\n493\n00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.865\nif anything, if you have any duplicates.\n\n494\n00:26:19.865 --> 00:26:20.630\nOkay?\n\n495\n00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.640\nThat is primarily what\nit tends to search for\n\n496\n00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.950\ninside your Active Directory to\nprepare it for synchronization.\n\n497\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.910\nNow, I went in and downloaded this.\n\n498\n00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:33.800\nLet me go back through here and\nlook at my downloads here.\n\n499\n00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.007\nAnd I'm gonna pull that over to\nthe desktop so that we can see it.\n\n500\n00:26:41.024 --> 00:26:41.740\nWell, maybe.\n\n501\n00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.640\nAnd then, I'm gonna right click and\nthen zip this thing.\n\n502\n00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.640\nExtract it all.\n\n503\n00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.277\nPut it right there on the desktop as well,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n504\n00:26:55.109 --> 00:26:59.056\nAnd then, on the side of that folder,\nI'll run it.\n\n505\n00:26:59.056 --> 00:26:59.706\nMaybe.\n\n506\n00:27:02.144 --> 00:27:03.049\nI think it's tricking me.\n\n507\n00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.661\nHere we go.\n\n508\n00:27:05.728 --> 00:27:07.970\nSo I'm simply gonna run the IdFix tool.\n\n509\n00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.910\nAnd it actually says, hey,\neverything's actually working.\n\n510\n00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:12.500\nAre you sure?\n\n511\n00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.195\nAnd it's giving me a privacy statement\nof what's gonna end up happening here.\n\n512\n00:27:17.261 --> 00:27:18.900\nAnd so, now it's ready for me to run.\n\n513\n00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.900\nI simply hit query.\n\n514\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.070\nAnd there we go.\n\n515\n00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.610\nOkay.\n\n516\n00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:26.980\nSo, remember, I said that what I had done\na little bit earlier is I went through my\n\n517\n00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:32.080\nactive directory in which I had a few\naccounts here, and I created some errors.\n\n518\n00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.680\nAnd instead, when I ran this count,\nor this tool in an earlier episode,\n\n519\n00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.710\nwe had where it actually went\nthrough the 95 different queries and\n\n520\n00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.380\nit found zero errors.\n\n521\n00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.040\nOkay?\n\n522\n00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.490\nWell, now,\nyou can see at this particular point here\n\n523\n00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:49.160\nwhere it actually gives me where\nthose errors are going to be.\n\n524\n00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:49.690\nOkay?\n\n525\n00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.560\nAnd whose errors that they are.\n\n526\n00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.710\nAnd so,\nhere you can see some of the errors.\n\n527\n00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.560\nA character, top level domain.\n\n528\n00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.440\nTop level domain.\n\n529\n00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.580\nCharacter.\n\n530\n00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.037\nAnd these attributes that\nit's actually seeing.\n\n531\n00:28:00.037 --> 00:28:03.510\nAnd then, it tells me what\nthe value currently is and\n\n532\n00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.045\nwhat the update should end up being.\n\n533\n00:28:06.045 --> 00:28:07.150\nOkay?\nWhen you take a look and\n\n534\n00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.050\nhere's a duplicate, duplicate.\n\n535\n00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:13.020\nAnd here's one that's actually looks\nlike that there was a single tick mark\n\n536\n00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.290\ninstead of what's supposed to be here.\n\n537\n00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.290\nAnd also a couple of quotes.\n\n538\n00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.180\nYou name it.\nThere were a couple of different things.\n\n539\n00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:23.300\nNow, the good thing is this,\nif I see them right here this means\n\n540\n00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.120\nthat what I can do is say, Daniel,\nI'm gonna create a list for you.\n\n541\n00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.100\nNow, you just have to go back and\ncheck out every single one of these and\n\n542\n00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.245\nfix all those errors.\n\n543\n00:28:30.245 --> 00:28:32.710\nOkay?\nIt still doesn't sound like fun, okay.\n\n544\n00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.983\nBut if you like doing that, if you\nare one of those people that I wanna\n\n545\n00:28:35.983 --> 00:28:39.090\nmanually fix these,\nyou can do that perfectly fine.\n\n546\n00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:43.310\nBut the nice thing is, notice that\nthere's a little action drop down.\n\n547\n00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.450\nAnd it's from right here that I can\nactually edit or remove it completely.\n\n548\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:48.540\nYou name it.\n\n549\n00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.720\nI can go through and\ntry and tell it what to do.\n\n550\n00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.630\nSo if I select edit here, then it\nactually allows me to go through and\n\n551\n00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.480\nactually do some of those\nactions as we go through that.\n\n552\n00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.060\nAnd I can pick one of these.\n\n553\n00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.640\nAnd let's just do edit here.\n\n554\n00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.060\nMy problem is remembering what's\nactually done in each one,\n\n555\n00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.332\ncuz I don't, at this point.\n\n556\n00:29:07.332 --> 00:29:08.676\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n557\n00:29:08.676 --> 00:29:12.080\n>> Well, let's say what we wanna\ndo is we wanna actually edit that.\n\n558\n00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.420\nSo I go ahead and hit apply.\n\n559\n00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.130\nIt says, hey, are you sure you\nwant to apply these edits?\n\n560\n00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.990\nNow, when I do that,\nnotice what it's gonna do.\n\n561\n00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.070\nIt's gonna actually update these values\nto this update here in the edit.\n\n562\n00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.840\nI'm gonna apply that, and say yes.\n\n563\n00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:27.510\nOkay.\n\n564\n00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.010\nAnd it tells me that\nthe action has been completed.\n\n565\n00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:31.250\nAnd I will accept it.\n\n566\n00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.420\nAnd then, I should run the query again.\n\n567\n00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.060\nOkay.\n\n568\n00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.330\nAnd notice that it actually does find\nsome other issues that are going on\n\n569\n00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:40.720\nperfectly fine.\n\n570\n00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.140\nAgain, you run that, and then you take\na look and see what these values are.\n\n571\n00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.340\nAnd the reason why this is not wanting to\nsync up with Office 365 is I have that\n\n572\n00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.240\ndot local.\n\n573\n00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.810\nAnd I didn't actually\nregister that as part\n\n574\n00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.210\nof that DNS name that\nOffice 365 recognizes.\n\n575\n00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.470\nSo I know what the error is right\nthere for what we're looking for.\n\n576\n00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.190\nSo, there's a couple of other things\nthat that will actually mean that you'll\n\n577\n00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:05.470\nmanually have to go in there and accept\nand do the things that need to be done.\n\n578\n00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.870\nSo, sometimes there are things\nthat it will correct\n\n579\n00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.580\nautomatically right away for you.\n\n580\n00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.960\nThere are absolutely things that you might\nhave to manually go in there and correct.\n\n581\n00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.453\nHopefully it's gonna be four-\n>> Yeah.\n\n582\n00:30:15.453 --> 00:30:16.456\n>> And not 1,005.\n\n583\n00:30:16.456 --> 00:30:17.531\n>> 100. Yeah. >> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n584\n00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:19.620\nSo, this is one of those tools.\n\n585\n00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.036\nBut with duplicates, if you have something\nlike that, running IdFix is one of\n\n586\n00:30:23.036 --> 00:30:26.530\nthe ones that absolutely help you\nprepare your active directory.\n\n587\n00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.400\nNow, the other one, right, is that even\nthough IdFix will work with the formatting\n\n588\n00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.620\nerrors that are also out there for you,\nthe one that they really are proud of.\n\n589\n00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.620\nLet me go back to the download here.\n\n590\n00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:43.560\nIs gonna be this one,\nwhich is called AD modified dot net, okay.\n\n591\n00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.370\nI didn't make up the name or\nI wouldn't be doing this.\n\n592\n00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.080\nlet me go and run this thing.\n\n593\n00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.740\nAnd so, this one is a little\nbit more of an intensive tool.\n\n594\n00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.310\nYou'll see it actually takes\na little bit of time here.\n\n595\n00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.110\nAnd then click next.\n\n596\n00:30:54.110 --> 00:31:00.450\nAnd let it do its process\nhere of what it's doing.\n\n597\n00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.980\nAnd now, unified, oh, its been removed.\n\n598\n00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.010\nSo maybe I actually ran the wrong one.\n\n599\n00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:06.210\nI may have.\n\n600\n00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:07.030\nOkay.\n\n601\n00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.550\nLet me see here, on this particular tool.\n\n602\n00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.050\nOops.\n\n603\n00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.735\nMaybe I didn't download this one.\n\n604\n00:31:12.735 --> 00:31:14.154\nI thought I had.\n\n605\n00:31:17.121 --> 00:31:19.310\nDirectory synchronization tool.\n\n606\n00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.650\nLet me see, did I put it in\nthe recycle bin by accident?\n\n607\n00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.300\nI did not.\n\n608\n00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.200\nAll right.\n\n609\n00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.690\nSo on this one,\nwe'd actually have to download it.\n\n610\n00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.550\nSo I thought I had\npreviously downloaded it.\n\n611\n00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:37.400\nSee there's, absolutely not\ndownloading anything correctly here.\n\n612\n00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.520\nEverything's kinda shutting down on me.\n\n613\n00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.290\nAll right.\n\n614\n00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:49.740\nSo this admodify.net download.\n\n615\n00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.133\nSo, this is how we would normally,\nof course, do it.\n\n616\n00:31:53.133 --> 00:31:54.434\nGo and find what it is.\n\n617\n00:31:54.434 --> 00:31:58.822\nAnd there is the AD download or\nModify here.\n\n618\n00:31:58.822 --> 00:32:02.970\nLet me go to this .Net.\n\n619\n00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:07.140\nAnd nice big purple button and\nI'll download that.\n\n620\n00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.880\n>> It's like a giant bruise.\n\n621\n00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.270\n>> It is, yeah.\n\n622\n00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:13.340\nIt's a good thing isn't it?\n\n623\n00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:13.990\nIt's fast.\n\n624\n00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.650\nLet me see here.\n\n625\n00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.430\nOn the modify we'll run this.\n\n626\n00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.820\nOh, it actually says it's compressed.\n\n627\n00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.360\nSo never mind,\nlet me not run it from right there.\n\n628\n00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.470\nGo to the downloads here.\n\n629\n00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:26.130\nWhere did it save?\n\n630\n00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.360\nThis is what I get for saving it where\nI didn't know where I was gonna save.\n\n631\n00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.170\nHere let me save as.\n\n632\n00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:35.850\nOh, its on the desktop.\n\n633\n00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.040\nThat helps.\n\n634\n00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.510\nED modify, let me extract that.\n\n635\n00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.940\nExtract it again and there it is.\n\n636\n00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.060\n>> We'll see some actual\nsystem administration.\n\n637\n00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.620\n>> Yeah, this is-\n>> This is the job.\n\n638\n00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:55.480\nYou are seeing it in all its glory, so, if\nyou're going, man this is kind of tedious,\n\n639\n00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.730\nyeah, yeah, yeah, it is from time to time.\n\n640\n00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.376\n>> Yeah.\nAll right, so we're gonna run this\n\n641\n00:33:00.376 --> 00:33:05.350\nAD modified a couple of\nprerequisites to .NET 3.5 framework.\n\n642\n00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.520\nSo, I'm gonna click on that AD modified\n2.1 that I just downloaded and\n\n643\n00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.490\nselect the icon.\n\n644\n00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:15.030\nAnd in a moment here, there we go,\nthat's a little bit better.\n\n645\n00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:19.010\nSo, I wish I could zoom this in so\nwe could see it a little bit more but\n\n646\n00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:22.440\nthere's nothing for me zoom in here so\nit actually asked me my options.\n\n647\n00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.900\nSo this one gives a little bit more\ngranularity that you can change.\n\n648\n00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.130\nSo modify attributes, this is where it\nactually gives us that ability to go\n\n649\n00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:34.080\nin and take those attributes just\nlike we saw in IDFix and also\n\n650\n00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:39.350\nwe can undo changes of Asche also have\nbeen done as well after we modify them.\n\n651\n00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.510\nSo if you do modify changes with this, and\n\n652\n00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.380\nall of a sudden you realize, I didn't\nlike those, you can come back out.\n\n653\n00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.390\nAnd, of course, import mailbox rights.\n\n654\n00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.640\nIf you are setting up\nyour active directory for\n\n655\n00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.580\nthat hybrid, where you are actually going\nto be taking your exchange information and\n\n656\n00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.090\ngetting it up to Office 365.\n\n657\n00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.960\nYou may also make sure that\neverybody has their rights the way\n\n658\n00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.280\nthat they want to as well so just\nrealize that you need to import that and\n\n659\n00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.760\nthen of course you can\ntake it up to Office 365.\n\n660\n00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:11.410\nIf I now select the modify attributes\nat this point I can click on this\n\n661\n00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:16.430\ndomain list here and it is going to ask me\nwhich of these am I trying to follow and\n\n662\n00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:20.650\nfrom this one here I am going\nto select ITV Pro TV demo.\n\n663\n00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.120\nAnd on the domain control list\nthere should only be one.\n\n664\n00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.780\nAnd then I can filter out what I\ndon't want to actually go through, so\n\n665\n00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.700\nlike public folders I don't care about\nright now, contacts not so much so.\n\n666\n00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:35.250\nAnd then click on the little green arrow.\n\n667\n00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:42.970\nSelect it here, and let's see,\ndo I add Let me see.\n\n668\n00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:44.070\nAdd to the list.\n\n669\n00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:48.510\nOh, all right, good thing it's\nnot a very large environment.\n\n670\n00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.510\nSo there it is.\nIt's got every single user and\n\n671\n00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.030\nevery object that I have\ninside of that domain.\n\n672\n00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.120\nI need to select one.\n\n673\n00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.410\nSo I probably should not have done that.\n\n674\n00:34:56.410 --> 00:34:59.950\nLet me go back here and\nfilter that down a little bit more.\n\n675\n00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.440\nAnd I'll just select hosts.\n\n676\n00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.590\nThat should actually make it\na little bit more, oh there you go.\n\n677\n00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.210\nA little bit easier.\n\n678\n00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:06.190\n>> A little less information there.\n\n679\n00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.480\n>> Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have\ntried everybody, that was just me.\n\n680\n00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.790\nSo I'm gonna select Wesley and click next.\n\n681\n00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:12.810\nAnd let's see.\n\n682\n00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.150\nOkay, I was gonna say,\nit should actually bring up this.\n\n683\n00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:19.090\nSo notice what its actually doing\nits showing me his object, right,\n\n684\n00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.810\nhere is user object inside of active\ndirectory and giving me that chance to be\n\n685\n00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:27.140\nable to modify those same things that\nwe would actually need to modify and\n\n686\n00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.040\nchange that if we wanted to.\n\n687\n00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.200\nSo here's another way that we can go ahead\nand modify every single one of those\n\n688\n00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.900\ninstead of having to go through and\nsearch the Active Directory,\n\n689\n00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.240\nit essentially allows me to pick it up and\nthen I can go back and run through and\n\n690\n00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.710\npick the next one, next one, next one and\nmodify what I need to individually there.\n\n691\n00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.460\nSo, depending on what your action is.\n\n692\n00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.450\nIf it's a small number,\nthat may be the way to go.\n\n693\n00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.270\nLarge numbers, though,\n\n694\n00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.620\nyou might be wondering what am\nI gonna do with a large number?\n\n695\n00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.030\nWell, if you did have multiple\nobjects that have the same errors,\n\n696\n00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.350\nthis is where PowerShell comes in.\n\n697\n00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:02.140\nBeing able to modify attributes in bulk is\nsome of the things that we've also done in\n\n698\n00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.260\na previous episode, so\nmake sure you check how to do that.\n\n699\n00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.830\nYou can do it right here against\nyour active directory domain.\n\n700\n00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.700\nOr you can do it against the Active\nDirectory up in Office 365 as well and\n\n701\n00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:16.300\nwe did do a little show on\nthat where we took PowerShell,\n\n702\n00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.880\nshowed you how to modify\nattributes inside of Office 365.\n\n703\n00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.140\nSo you just change domain and\nyou are ready to go.\n\n704\n00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.790\nSo, being able to do stuff like that is\nreally some of the preparation work that\n\n705\n00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:27.900\nneeds to be done.\n\n706\n00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.220\nSo remember that we needn't\nhave that decision, right?\n\n707\n00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.330\nWhat is the ultimate\nresult that I need to see.\n\n708\n00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.840\nAnd then to get my active\ndirectory prepared\n\n709\n00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:40.530\nI may need to verify that my DNS name\nis actually something that's routable.\n\n710\n00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:43.910\nIf it's not, know how to actually\nget around that routability\n\n711\n00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.690\nby using the UPN suffix.\n\n712\n00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.500\nAnd then take a look at\nyour active directory and\n\n713\n00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.580\nrunning through some of those\nutilities and tools to prepare it.\n\n714\n00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.840\nGetting ready for\nthat active directory sync.\n\n715\n00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.890\n>> Awesome stuff Rowney very\nexcellent tools available to us\n\n716\n00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.150\nto help make this run\na little more smoothly.\n\n717\n00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.480\nNow that being said, I know Rowney,\n\n718\n00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.981\nyou've got a whole lot more to talk about\nactually we are not even close to done.\n\n719\n00:37:04.981 --> 00:37:06.647\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're gonna have to move it\n\n720\n00:37:06.647 --> 00:37:09.865\nto part two cuz looking at the clock,\nthat joker has long since expired.\n\n721\n00:37:09.865 --> 00:37:10.380\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> So\n\n722\n00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.820\nRonnie I look forward to seeing you there.\n\n723\n00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.490\nWe hope to see you there as well.\n\n724\n00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:15.750\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n725\n00:37:15.750 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:20.610\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode well we are continuing on\n\n4\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.040\nwith our Office 365 identities and\nrequirements, specifically a part\n\n5\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.700\ntwo here on synchronizing\nActive Directory with Office 365.\n\n6\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.070\nAnd joining us yet again, welcoming him\nback, is our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.960\nRonnie welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.750\nHow are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.500\n>> I'm doing great as we continue\non to take a look at Office 365,\n\n10\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.780\nespecially Active Directory\nsynchronization, right?\n\n11\n00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.240\nThe ability to insure that our on premises\nActive Directory is also gonna sync up\n\n12\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.350\nwith what we normally have in\nthe background of Office 365.\n\n13\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.420\nWhich is gonna be\nthe Azure Active Directory that's\n\n14\n00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.890\nback there holding up that\nend of the deal for us.\n\n15\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.170\nAnd what we also need to be able to do\nof course, is realize something that,\n\n16\n00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.140\nif we're gonna be having where\neverything is gonna come together and\n\n17\n00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.800\nit needs to work together.\n\n18\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.530\nWe also need to realize that not\neverything that we have on our on-premises\n\n19\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.130\nneeds to be synced up to\nthe Azure Active Directory, as well.\n\n20\n00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.770\nNormally, when we do something like this,\nit's fairly easy to just say, all right,\n\n21\n00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.230\nlet's just do this all blanket, and\nwe turn over everything over there.\n\n22\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.190\nBut, remember, that there's always gonna\nbe some things that you'll have inside\n\n23\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.650\nyour own network that doesn't\nactually need to be synced.\n\n24\n00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.060\nAnd the more stuff that you send over,\neats up bandwidth, of course,\n\n25\n00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.380\nbetween your connection and\nof course Office 365.\n\n26\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.540\nAnd that means users will end up\nslowing down as you have more and\n\n27\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.940\nmore objects to sync.\n\n28\n00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.870\nSo the better idea of course then,\n\n29\n00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.170\nis to make sure you know how to\nset up everything so that you go.\n\n30\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.420\nHey, look, here are the absolute things\nthat need to be synchronized up there.\n\n31\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.920\nBut everything else I just\nwanna leave on mine and\n\n32\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.410\nnot have it sync across\nthe network connection.\n\n33\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.140\nAnd that's what we also need to plan for,\ntoo.\n\n34\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.420\nSo when you are actually thinking\nabout this synchronization, you do.\n\n35\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.400\nYou need to take into consideration those\nthings that need to be synced up, and\n\n36\n00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.110\nthose things that do not\nneed to be synced up.\n\n37\n00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.280\nAnd ensure that your Active Directory\nis set up in that way that actually\n\n38\n00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.450\nmakes it easy.\n\n39\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.170\nNow, when we start talking then about\nhow do we actually figure this out and\n\n40\n00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.440\nwhat do we do if we want that to happen.\n\n41\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.450\nIs you and I have to be able to set\nup what we call of course then,\n\n42\n00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.630\nActive Directory filtering,\n\n43\n00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.290\nthat will allow us to filter that out\nbefore we do the synchronization.\n\n44\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.570\nThe way that the synchronization happens\nis that just about every three hours it's\n\n45\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.680\ngoing to try and do some sync, and\nnormally what we're syncing up, of course,\n\n46\n00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.610\nare changes.\n\n47\n00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.570\nBut that initial synchronization if you\ntake every object in Active Directory,\n\n48\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.730\nit can take a long time in\ndoing the synchronization.\n\n49\n00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.010\nSo before you start that,\nyou want to go ahead and plan out, hey,\n\n50\n00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.580\nhere's what I want to sync up and\nhere's what I do not want to sync up.\n\n51\n00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.450\nAnd so the way that they break this down\nfor us in terms of best practices for\n\n52\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.440\nOffice 365, is to think about it\nin three different ways, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.840\nWhat domains do I want to sync up, or\nsingle domain do I want to sync up?\n\n54\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.210\nAnd that means if I'm in\nan Active Directory environment,\n\n55\n00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.780\nin which there are multiple domains.\n\n56\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.410\nFor example,\nI showed you in another episode,\n\n57\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.190\nthat I have not only ITProTVdemo.com,\n\n58\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.510\nwhich is the one that we're using\nas our main demonstration here.\n\n59\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.670\nBut I also have my own lab environment,\nand my own lab environment\n\n60\n00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.160\nis not necessarily the one that I\nneed to sync up, but it may be.\n\n61\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.870\nAnd I need to consider if I'm gonna\ndo that to maybe limit it to that.\n\n62\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.840\nBut what about multiple\nother ones out there?\n\n63\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.870\nBut I really don't need to sync those up.\n\n64\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.700\nI don't wanna take an entire Active\nDirectory forest with multiple domains and\n\n65\n00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.420\nsync up everything, if I really only need\nto sync up one or two possible domains.\n\n66\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.420\nCuz remember, we're actually\ntalking about generating traffic.\n\n67\n00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.680\nPeople are connecting to Office 365,\n\n68\n00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.320\nand you're still generating traffic there,\nit's gonna cause a lot of bottlenecks if\n\n69\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.180\nyou have a fairly limited\namount of bandwidth.\n\n70\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.010\n>> So Ronnie, what do we do?\n\n71\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.510\nWe've got all this information.\n\n72\n00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.546\nWe know that some of it's not going to,\n\n73\n00:03:53.546 --> 00:03:56.830\nor at least it doesn't need to\nbe synced over to Office 365.\n\n74\n00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.120\nHow do we differentiate and\nlet Office know,\n\n75\n00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.210\nhey this is the only stuff you actually\nneed to be aware of and filter that down?\n\n76\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.520\n>> Yeah the good thing is, you don't\nhave to do it in the manual process\n\n77\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.990\nin terms of you trying to\nfigure out through PowerShell.\n\n78\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.250\nNow can you if you want to?\n\n79\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.820\nYes.\n\n80\n00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.140\n[LAUGH] If you absolutely wanna learn how\nto do that, there are ways of course,\n\n81\n00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.110\nthat you can script that out to\npull out exactly what you need.\n\n82\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.800\nBut the nice thing is,\nthe way that Active Directory\n\n83\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.860\nbegins to do the synchronization for\nus, is that it gives us a tool that\n\n84\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.800\nwe can actually use in the overall\nprocess of synchronizing everything.\n\n85\n00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.420\nBut before we do so, that tool also of\ncourse once you install that, allows\n\n86\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.880\nyou to have access to what some other\ntools that installs in the background too.\n\n87\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.476\nSo even though we haven't\ngotten to the point,\n\n88\n00:04:41.476 --> 00:04:43.960\nwhere weâ€™re actually doing\nthe synchronization.\n\n89\n00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.620\nThere are tools that we need to install\nfrom that particular synchronization tool,\n\n90\n00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.530\nand then we can use those tools to help\nus, before we actually sync up anything.\n\n91\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.900\nSo I know it sounds strange.\n\n92\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.650\nWe download and install this\nsynchronization tool, we just don't run\n\n93\n00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.600\nthis synchronization yet, and then we use\nthe other tools that come along with it.\n\n94\n00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.360\nActually do some of the things\nwe're talking about, and\n\n95\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.950\nspecifically we're talking about\nthe idea of filtering here is what we\n\n96\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.330\nare taking a look at.\n\n97\n00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.180\nSo let me show you what I'm talking\nabout when we get started here.\n\n98\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.320\nSo the tool that we normally end up using,\nis one that has actually changed names\n\n99\n00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.430\nover a period of years, so the initial\none was the one that was called DirSync.\n\n100\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.045\nI know it sounds weird, but\n\n101\n00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:28.930\nD-I-R-S-Y-N-C DirSync is the tool\nthat I remember getting started with.\n\n102\n00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.940\nAnd then over the years, it changed\ninto Windows Active Directory Sync, and\n\n103\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.870\nthen there was just Active Directory\nSynchronization Online, and\n\n104\n00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.270\nthere were a couple of other ones.\n\n105\n00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.480\nBut today, the most current\nversion is the one that they call\n\n106\n00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.430\nAzure Active Directory Connect.\n\n107\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.360\nSo let me show you here.\n\n108\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.440\nSo here in\nthe Azure Active Directory Connect,\n\n109\n00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.050\nwe're gonna be installing\nthis tool later on.\n\n110\n00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.320\nBut just kind of realize, I've already\ninstalled it so that we could at least get\n\n111\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.430\nused to seeing the tool for\nthe filtering that we need to.\n\n112\n00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.830\nOnce we install the tools,\nit's gonna ask us a lot of questions, and\n\n113\n00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.100\nit's gonna install\nessentially an appliance,\n\n114\n00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.730\na server in the background that once we\ninstall it, it's set and you forget it.\n\n115\n00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.280\nBut along with that utility comes,\nwell a bunch of other utilities here.\n\n116\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.380\nAnd let me see if I can scroll\non over just a little bit here.\n\n117\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.990\nSo notice underneath Azure AD Connect.\n\n118\n00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.010\nThere's Azure AD Connect.\n\n119\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.120\nThere's Synchronization Rules Editor.\n\n120\n00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.320\nAnd we're gonna get into\nthat a little bit later on.\n\n121\n00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.270\nThere's also the Synchronization Server,\nand\n\n122\n00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.130\nthe Synchronization\nService Key Management.\n\n123\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.750\nAll these are actually managers,\nis what they are.\n\n124\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.930\nAnd the one that we're looking for\nto help us to filter out,\n\n125\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.400\nis gonna be the Synchronization Service.\n\n126\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.650\nSo I'm just going to click on that,\nand that will bring up this Azure\n\n127\n00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.460\nsynchronization service manager on my\nmachine is what we want to be able to do.\n\n128\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.070\nOkay.\n\n129\n00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.710\nNow this tool in itself, right,\ndoesn't run very easily if you just go.\n\n130\n00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.760\nOh its just single too, but it's because\nof the way that its installed and\n\n131\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.210\nit gather up some information\nin the background,\n\n132\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.000\nthat also really helps us out here.\n\n133\n00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.770\nOkay.\n\n134\n00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.070\nSo once we get in here, okay, and\n\n135\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.680\nwe wanna talk about the idea of syncing\nup or filtering out just by domain.\n\n136\n00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.989\nCuz that's one of the major features\nthat we can do is I click on connectors.\n\n137\n00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.000\nAnd once I click on connectors,\nyou can see right here what it's done.\n\n138\n00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.440\nThere it is.\n\n139\n00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.160\nHere is my Azure Active Directory,\nso I can connect to this domain and\n\n140\n00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.750\nthe synchronization, or I can also\nconnect here which is the on premises.\n\n141\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.810\nSo notice that this synchronization\nservice manager sees both.\n\n142\n00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.930\nNow, we haven't run any\nsynchronization here.\n\n143\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.596\nI ensured that I didn't do that, but\n\n144\n00:07:39.596 --> 00:07:45.358\nif I wanted to ensure that I was only this\none domain or to choose another domain,\n\n145\n00:07:45.358 --> 00:07:49.585\nI can right click on that domain and\ngo down to properties.\n\n146\n00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:54.948\nAnd when I select properties here,\nI can then come down here and\n\n147\n00:07:54.948 --> 00:07:58.601\nselect configure directory partitions.\n\n148\n00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:01.477\nAnd verify that I have\nthese directory partitions.\n\n149\n00:08:01.477 --> 00:08:05.325\nNow, mine here only has\na single one that's available,\n\n150\n00:08:05.325 --> 00:08:10.215\nso that's the only one that I have,\nbut at this point, once I have that,\n\n151\n00:08:10.215 --> 00:08:13.341\nif I had multiple ones,\nI can simply uncheck or\n\n152\n00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:17.300\ncheck the ones that I want to\nactually to be able to sync up.\n\n153\n00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.570\nSo, I can do something\nlike that if I choose to.\n\n154\n00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.600\nNow, the other option is also down here\nwhere it says select containers for\n\n155\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.280\nthis partition, as well and\nwe'll actually see that there.\n\n156\n00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.000\nAnd then you have to enter in\nyour credentials there, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.850\nSo just kinda realize that that's\nthe way that we can do it for\n\n158\n00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.700\nthe actual domain if we were to\ndo something like this, as well.\n\n159\n00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.510\nNow, if you make any changes,\n\n160\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.220\nthe problem that you have is\nthat this is a two-part thing.\n\n161\n00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.980\nAnd this is where a lot of people\nkind of get lost in this, right?\n\n162\n00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.170\nSo I'm gonna leave this thing checked but\nthen show you the second part.\n\n163\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.200\nIf you make a change there,\nin other words you go look,\n\n164\n00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.030\nI don't want the ITProTVdemo.com,\n\n165\n00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:59.800\nI want the lab.ITProTV domain\ninstead that I want to sync up here.\n\n166\n00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.490\nWell, after you actually select that and\n\n167\n00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.250\nyou make that change, it's from there\nyou have to actually go back in and\n\n168\n00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.930\nlet me be sure I'm telling\nyou right at this point here.\n\n169\n00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.540\nYou have to actually check\na run profile as well.\n\n170\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.430\nSo, let me do that too.\n\n171\n00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.540\nSo notice that I have\nthe action that says run, and\n\n172\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.600\nso there it is,\nthe run connector that I have, and\n\n173\n00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.270\nthese are different profiles that we\nactually have set up and in place.\n\n174\n00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.270\nSo if you modify you also have to verify\nwhat you want to modify from here, okay.\n\n175\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.210\nSo do you want to actually do a full\nimport out of that active directory?\n\n176\n00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.681\nSo if we choose lab.ITProTV or\n\n177\n00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:41.540\nITPro.TV, we would select that,\nwe'd do that full import, and\n\n178\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.485\nthat would actually be getting\nthat synchronization process.\n\n179\n00:09:44.485 --> 00:09:48.360\nNotice you can actually just do\nthe full synchronization instead.\n\n180\n00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.720\nIf you made some change and\n\n181\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.140\nyou want to actually begin to\nsynchronize you can do that.\n\n182\n00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.590\nThe delta imports and\n\n183\n00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.700\nthe delta synchronizations here are for\nchanges instead.\n\n184\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.560\nSo what is different between those\ndirectories, if you want to do that.\n\n185\n00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.650\nAnd of course you can export that too.\n\n186\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.264\nSo depending on what you want to do,\nyou may choose to do the full import,\n\n187\n00:10:07.264 --> 00:10:09.830\nfull synchronization or these changes.\n\n188\n00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.860\nSo remember those two step processes.\n\n189\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.650\nFirst, of course,\n\n190\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:20.020\nis to change the domain if that's what you\nchoose to do in a multiple domain forest.\n\n191\n00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.910\nAnd then, if you do make a change, you\nhave to come over here to actions where it\n\n192\n00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.100\nsays run and verify or\nmake sure you actually do the import.\n\n193\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.510\nIf you haven't actually synched it up\nbefore you may wanna do the full import.\n\n194\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.690\nIf it is a synchronization but\nyou're actually were saying,\n\n195\n00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.400\nlook I need to re-synch this up,\nfull or just the changes.\n\n196\n00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.070\nYou choose which one\nthat you want to do here.\n\n197\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.540\nAnd from that point it's\nnot gonna sync up yet.\n\n198\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.600\nThe reason why is that I've got\nit halted in the background,\n\n199\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.880\nthat AAD connect is not connected and\n\n200\n00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.960\ndoing the synchronization because it's\nnormally done on a task scheduler.\n\n201\n00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.120\nAnd I paused the task scheduler so it\nwouldn't actually do all those things, so\n\n202\n00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.030\nwe could do another shelf right now.\n\n203\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.250\nBut that's some of the things that can\nhappen if you are in a multiple domain.\n\n204\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.770\nAnd you need to only sync up one or\ntwo and not every single domain.\n\n205\n00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.870\nSo it is something that we need\nto be able to concentrate on and\n\n206\n00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.190\ndo if we are doing this because\nit really does help out.\n\n207\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.820\nSo that's one of the ways that\nwe can actually cause that\n\n208\n00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.120\nfiltering to go on inside\nof our Active Directory.\n\n209\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.920\nBut there may be some other ways that\nwe also want to talk about as well.\n\n210\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.965\nAnd that's what we want to get to, too.\n\n211\n00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:25.740\n>> Yeah, well that's a really\ngood place for us to segue.\n\n212\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.500\nObviously, what Ronnie was just showing\nus is probably one of the initial ways in\n\n213\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.000\nwhich you would want to try to filter\nout your synchronization policies.\n\n214\n00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.530\nBut, Ronnie, what are some of the other\nways that we would want to move in to?\n\n215\n00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.040\nIt's gotta be a lot of different things.\n\n216\n00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.690\n>> There really are.\n\n217\n00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.580\nThe very fact is that it may not be\nwhere we have multiple domains, right?\n\n218\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.680\nBut you may have a special OU\nthat was just used, lets say for\n\n219\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.380\nan example, with terminal servers.\n\n220\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.140\nOkay?\nWhat are the chances that you're\n\n221\n00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.860\ngoing to sync up that OU with terminal?\n\n222\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.820\nThe terminal server's OUs group.\n\n223\n00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.920\nUp to Office 365.\n\n224\n00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.850\nProbably not gonna do something like that,\nright?\n\n225\n00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.910\nSo if you're actually new,\nthe remote desktop services.\n\n226\n00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.810\nI use the old term, the one that I grew\nup with here, the terminal services here.\n\n227\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.670\nBut that may be a group that you\njust are not gonna ever synchronize.\n\n228\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.100\nBut remember if you synchronize\nthe entire domain, the entire domain,\n\n229\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.900\nwhat is also gonna get dragged out there?\n\n230\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.380\nThe same thing, right?\n\n231\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.870\nSo there maybe a special group or\nusers that are never gonna use Office 365,\n\n232\n00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:28.090\nyou don't ever have to actually\nsync those objects up there.\n\n233\n00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.640\nSo what we want to do is we want\nto be able to sync up using what?\n\n234\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.370\nOUs instead.\n\n235\n00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.480\nWell the good is the process\nis nearly the same but\n\n236\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.880\nwe have to go a little\nbit deeper into this.\n\n237\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.170\nNow the key of course comes in and\nthe good thing there is most of us are,\n\n238\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.160\nyou know if we're having to do this,\nthe filtering process.\n\n239\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.240\nWe can do the synchronization and\nthe filtering anytime that we want to.\n\n240\n00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.780\nIt doesn't always have to be at the very\nbeginning when we're setting up.\n\n241\n00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.570\nOkay?\n\n242\n00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.250\nBut does it help?\n\n243\n00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.760\nYou better believe it, right?\n\n244\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.120\nIf I sync up my entire active directory\nand all of a sudden somebody says\n\n245\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.430\nwhy did you sync up those two departments,\nthey are never gonna use it?\n\n246\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.060\nWell that means I have to come back\nhere and do what, uncheck those two,\n\n247\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.000\nand tell it what, run another\nsynchronization and make it happen again.\n\n248\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.550\nSo the more that you can plan and\n\n249\n00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.770\nset this up before hand\nthe better off you're gonna be.\n\n250\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.660\nBut you can run it anytime\nthat you need to and\n\n251\n00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.570\nactually to make sure that hey all\nthose are actually not syncing or\n\n252\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.320\nwe know I don't want those\nto be synced up after that.\n\n253\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.330\nSo what we would do if\nI should need the OU?\n\n254\n00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.590\nWell we come and\nstart pretty much the same way.\n\n255\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.370\nWe verify that we select connectors.\n\n256\n00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.640\nAnd then I'm gonna right\nclick on the IT Pro TV Demo,\n\n257\n00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.900\nthat's gonna be the domain that I've\nactually got set up with Office 365.\n\n258\n00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.620\nAnd I always look for properties at the\nbottom of the list, but it's right here.\n\n259\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.190\nProperties.\n\n260\n00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.480\nAnd we select the same thing.\n\n261\n00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.310\nConfigure direct repartitions,\nand this time\n\n262\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.459\nwe go in once we've selected the domain\nthat we actually want to filter by and\n\n263\n00:13:53.459 --> 00:13:56.550\nwhere you have multiple\ndomains where you do this.\n\n264\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.120\nAnd what you select that domain\nthen you click containers.\n\n265\n00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.280\nNow here where it can get\na little bit unusual.\n\n266\n00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.220\nNormally the username that set right here\n\n267\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:11.250\nis what was set when you install all\nthe Active Directory connect tool.\n\n268\n00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.600\nAnd so when you see that.\n\n269\n00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.100\nSo let me see if I can show\nyou briefly here, normally,\n\n270\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:22.340\nthat name is going to be under\nActive Directory Users and Computers.\n\n271\n00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.600\nAnd depending on whether you're\nrunning Server 2008 or Server 2012,\n\n272\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.800\nyou might see a couple of\ndifferent locations here.\n\n273\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.210\nIf I go to users, it actually\ncreated its own Microsoft Online.\n\n274\n00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.130\nMSOL underscore and\nthis fancy little number here.\n\n275\n00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:44.330\nAnd let's see if I can pull up\nthat little description there.\n\n276\n00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:49.080\nAccount created by Azure Active Directory,\nDCL5, application permission and\n\n277\n00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.300\nlocal active director.\n\n278\n00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.300\nThe deployment to be able to do\nthe hybrid type of solution.\n\n279\n00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.040\nSo this is normally the account\nthat is actually set up for\n\n280\n00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.320\nright where I was showing\nyou inside of here.\n\n281\n00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.800\nNow that account, unless you've gone\nback and manually added it into like\n\n282\n00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.200\nthe synchronization admins and\nall this It's not gonna work for you.\n\n283\n00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.080\nThat one, it actually just\nhas domain user privileges.\n\n284\n00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.700\nSo, in other words, if you're gonna use\nthis account to manage everything and\n\n285\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.910\nthis is gonna become a service account for\n\n286\n00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:27.110\nyou, you wanna change this\nto a service account name.\n\n287\n00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.310\nSo, instead, I wanna just put\nthe administrator and then I'm gonna use\n\n288\n00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.310\nthe password here just as a demo, but you\ncan change this to a service account name.\n\n289\n00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.870\nThat's probably better if you're\nactually going to do this.\n\n290\n00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.730\nAnd then click OK, and\n\n291\n00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:47.130\nin a moment here notice that gives me my\nentire structure of active directory here.\n\n292\n00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.721\nAnd, if I know that I'm not going\nto be using everything, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:56.136\nWhat I can do instead is\nsimply uncheck everything and\n\n294\n00:15:56.136 --> 00:16:01.545\njust say what I want to actually\nsynchronize up to Office 365.\n\n295\n00:16:01.545 --> 00:16:05.360\nSo I might just choose the OUs\nthat I've created, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.920\nThey're actually gonna\nneed synchronization.\n\n297\n00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.340\nSo let's just take, for\nan example, these two.\n\n298\n00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.370\nAnd when I click OK again,\nthen from this point on,\n\n299\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.990\nremember what's gonna happen\nwhen it does sync up.\n\n300\n00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.050\nIt's gonna look at the entire thing.\n\n301\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.870\nIt's gonna say,\nlet's just pick those two OUs instead.\n\n302\n00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.210\nMinimizing, reducing\nthe amount of traffic I have.\n\n303\n00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:22.850\nBut doing what?\n\n304\n00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:27.850\nGiving me the synchronization that I want\nfor those users to be able to do that.\n\n305\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.370\nAnd do not forget that once\nyou actually select that.\n\n306\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.580\nOh, I'm gonna see if I can click OK there.\n\n307\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.520\nThat's kind of balking at me for a moment.\n\n308\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.270\nOnce everything is actually\ndone in the background, and\n\n309\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.930\nit's still doing its thing.\n\n310\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:46.110\nThis is when you go back in and\nyou configure your run profile\n\n311\n00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.990\nto do what you want it to do, or\nyou just simply configure the when you\n\n312\n00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.420\nactually want it to run and\nwhat profiles you want it to run here.\n\n313\n00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.020\nSo you can go back in and\ndo that a little bit later on.\n\n314\n00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.743\nSo if you are in an active directory\nwith multiple domains, and\n\n315\n00:17:01.743 --> 00:17:04.820\nyou only need to\nsynchronize a few domains.\n\n316\n00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.010\nChoose the domain option and uncheck\nthe ones you don't need to synchronize.\n\n317\n00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:12.080\nIf you have a single domain and you go,\nlook, all these other things that I have\n\n318\n00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.300\nout here I'm never gonna synchronize, then\nyou would choose to actually be able to\n\n319\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.230\nfilter out, excuse me,\nby using just the OUs if you need to.\n\n320\n00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.810\nSo each time, remember the two step\nprocess, configure it, okay, or\n\n321\n00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.790\nchoose, gives me the option that\nyou actually want to filter it by.\n\n322\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:32.860\nAnd then after that, right, you need\nto make sure you change the run profile\n\n323\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.970\nto sync up,\nwhat you actually need to sync up then.\n\n324\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.540\nIf you're doing it for the first time,\n\n325\n00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.620\nthe full synchronization is probably\nthe one you want right then.\n\n326\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.470\nBut if this is again something\nthat you've done later on, right?\n\n327\n00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.050\nYou might just do what changes have\nactually happened since that point.\n\n328\n00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.930\nSo those are two other\nthings that we can do\n\n329\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.250\nthat give us a bit of\ncontrol that we need.\n\n330\n00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.110\n>> Very, very good stuff, obviously.\n\n331\n00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.530\nActually, Ronnie, as you're moving\nalong with this, your little procedure,\n\n332\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.120\nI think I'm seeing a method\nto your madness here.\n\n333\n00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.430\nIt serves, it seems like we're\nstarting with a wide scope and\n\n334\n00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.960\nnow we're starting to filter down and\nwe've gone from a directory,\n\n335\n00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.650\nthe entirety of the directory down to OUs,\n\n336\n00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:13.830\nI'm guessing what's gonna be next is\nsomething a little more fine, right?\n\n337\n00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.630\nA little more granular as far as the\ncontrol mechanisms or filter mechanisms.\n\n338\n00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.820\n>> You wouldn't believe how granular\nyou can really get if you choose to.\n\n339\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.780\nNow, this last little option\nthat we're talking about,\n\n340\n00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.010\nof course,\nis filtering by attributes itself.\n\n341\n00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.360\nNow remember that when we talk\nabout Active Directory, right?\n\n342\n00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.770\nAttributes essentially is\njust anything that you would\n\n343\n00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.460\nput into your Active Directory.\n\n344\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.510\nOkay, so you can imagine how\nfine grained that that can get.\n\n345\n00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.510\nIf you wanted to filter it all\nthe way down to a single attribute,\n\n346\n00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.470\nyou definitely can, and say hey here's\nonly the ones that I want to synchronize\n\n347\n00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:54.570\nall the way up to that so that can\nactually give you a little bit control.\n\n348\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.850\nNow, when you do these attributes, we're\ngonna kind of take a look at one of them\n\n349\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:03.850\nand walk you through the process of just\na brief bit of it Is you can actually\n\n350\n00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:08.880\nfilter by importing, or, I shouldn't\nsay importing, inbound or outbound.\n\n351\n00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.150\nI'm gonna get em both wrong here.\n\n352\n00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:15.610\nInbound is the preferred way to\nactually do the filtering, so\n\n353\n00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:21.210\nwhat you're putting into Office 365\nas you're doing that synchronization.\n\n354\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.670\nThat is the one that they really\nwant you to filter by instead.\n\n355\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.530\nWhen you do that,\nthat essentially becomes permanent.\n\n356\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:32.370\nIn other words, if changes are made in\nthe background of the synchronization,\n\n357\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.290\nActive Directory, and all that stuff,\n\n358\n00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.610\nthe in bound ones will always still\nmake it in terms of the filtering.\n\n359\n00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.720\nBut on the outbound side, they may not.\n\n360\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.340\nSo the changes end up coming in\nwith the tools and everything else.\n\n361\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.650\nOutbound filters are normally the ones\nthat end up dropping off somewhere for\n\n362\n00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:52.620\none reason or another and you can read\nall about that in the documentation of\n\n363\n00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.980\nthe way that this tool ends up working.\n\n364\n00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.130\nBut, yes, you can actually filter\nout by very simple and very,\n\n365\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.220\nvery detailed things as well.\n\n366\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.630\nSo, on this one, instead of using that\nsynchronization service, we are actually\n\n367\n00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:12.810\ngonna end up using another tool here which\nis gonna be the rules editor instead.\n\n368\n00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.930\nSo notice that there is\nthe synchronization rules editor.\n\n369\n00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.140\nEverything else we've done has actually\nbeen done using the synchronization\n\n370\n00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.540\nservice manager.\n\n371\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:24.910\nThis one though, requires these\nsynchronization rules editor, all right?\n\n372\n00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:27.980\nSo now with the rules editor in place,\n\n373\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.760\nyou can see that there's a bunch\nof predefined rules for us.\n\n374\n00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.210\nIt is what we're actually taking a look\nat if we were choosing to do this.\n\n375\n00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:43.100\nSo, what we're actually looking for\nis gonna be the In\n\n376\n00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.200\nfrom AD and we're looking for the user.\n\n377\n00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.040\nDo not synchronize here.\n\n378\n00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.220\nLet me make sure I'm talking about this.\n\n379\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.080\nOkay, now the problem that I have is,\nI don't have that, right.\n\n380\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.270\nSo let's say that I wanted to\nfilter out by a user instead.\n\n381\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.930\nNow, I have the Active Directory there and\nI have User Exchange, but\n\n382\n00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.980\nI don't really have just the user and\n\n383\n00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:19.410\nthe ability to not synchronize\nthat one individual, okay?\n\n384\n00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.130\nSo what I can do instead\nis actually add a new rule.\n\n385\n00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.070\nSo up here, if I don't see\nthe rule that I'm interested in,\n\n386\n00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.640\nI click on Add on Add a New Rule,\nand then we give it a name.\n\n387\n00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:36.820\nNow we try and\nfollow the same type of format here.\n\n388\n00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:42.470\nIn, from, make sure I type it in right.\n\n389\n00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:49.450\nAD for my on-premises Active Directory\n-user and then I'm going to do donotsync\n\n390\n00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.430\nand then I'm going to\ncall it a filter as well.\n\n391\n00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.790\nYou of course can choose the connected\nsystem that you want And\n\n392\n00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.530\neven the object type if you choose to,\nall this stuff can be filtered in,\n\n393\n00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.440\nI'm not gonna worry about it so\nmuch for right now.\n\n394\n00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:16.040\nAnd then I'm gonna click Next here.\n\n395\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.590\nSo the only thing I need to do is verify\nthat I've selected the correct system.\n\n396\n00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.480\nOops, well maybe not, source object here.\n\n397\n00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.700\nThis will be a- User?\n\n398\n00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.890\nLet's see,\nis it actually going to be a user account?\n\n399\n00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:35.225\n>> Quite an extensive list you got there.\n\n400\n00:22:35.225 --> 00:22:35.740\n[LAUGHS]\n>> It is, yeah!\n\n401\n00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.496\nI'm trying to actually find the right one\nthat I need here which is going to be\n\n402\n00:22:42.678 --> 00:22:45.050\nDomain, oh there it is.\n\n403\n00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.500\nIt's account, it's right there at the top.\n\n404\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.440\n>> The very one on the top.\n\n405\n00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.530\n>> Yeah I mean that was me.\n\n406\n00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:49.860\nI absolutely will tell you that.\n\n407\n00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.400\n>> That's a Ronnie Wong classic.\n\n408\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.920\n>> Every single time.\n\n409\n00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.620\nThat would actually be me.\n\n410\n00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:00.283\nLink type here,\nmake sure I choose the right one for\n\n411\n00:23:00.283 --> 00:23:04.530\nthe link type Forest, that's fine.\n\n412\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.757\nLink type is join, is the one that I need.\n\n413\n00:23:07.757 --> 00:23:10.150\nThe is gonna be person,\n\n414\n00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.170\nthat's the one that I want,\nthe connected person object type.\n\n415\n00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.880\nUser, I\n\n416\n00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.550\nthink account is actually the one cuz I\ndon't see user here down at the bottom.\n\n417\n00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:23.530\nSo I'm gonna say it's gonna be,\nno there it is, user.\n\n418\n00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.150\nSo see, I was not wrong,\n\n419\n00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:29.110\nI thought it was the account,\nbut it's actually user down here.\n\n420\n00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.760\nOkay?\n\n421\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.640\nSo once I have that, the only thing\nI need to do here under precedence is\n\n422\n00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.400\nactually select one that the number\nhasn't actually been in this list here.\n\n423\n00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.720\nSo on this one, I'm gonna select a lower\nnumber like 50, is what we're going to do.\n\n424\n00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:50.524\nClick Next, and at this point am I\nadding any particular group here?\n\n425\n00:23:50.524 --> 00:23:53.971\nI'm gonna select add group, and\n\n426\n00:23:53.971 --> 00:23:58.781\nthen add a clause, and\nin the attribute here.\n\n427\n00:23:58.781 --> 00:24:01.220\nI want the extension attribute 15.\n\n428\n00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.670\nNow you might be wondering what\nthe heck is extension attribute 15.\n\n429\n00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.000\nIt's whatever you want it to be.\n\n430\n00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.670\nSo we're essentially picking\na blank attribute, just so\n\n431\n00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.090\nwe don't mess up anything in\nthe Active Directory, okay.\n\n432\n00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:16.420\nAnd that's actually going to be equal,\nand on the value here I want\n\n433\n00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:21.840\nno Sync is the one that\nI want in the value box.\n\n434\n00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.590\nAnd of course, if you wanna add\nin multiple closets to make\n\n435\n00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.501\nit even more restrictive,\nyou could do that too.\n\n436\n00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:29.620\nClick next.\n\n437\n00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:34.570\nAnd then, is there anything I'm actually\ngonna do in the join rules group?\n\n438\n00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:35.280\nNope.\n\n439\n00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.490\nI'm not gonna add any groups there.\n\n440\n00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.110\nGo ahead and click next there.\n\n441\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.780\nAnd then in the transformation type, okay?\n\n442\n00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.980\nI want to add in a transformation.\n\n443\n00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.780\nAnd I change the flow type\nhere instead to constant.\n\n444\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.180\nSo in other words, this is actually\nconstantly doing the transforming and\n\n445\n00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.490\nthe synchronization here.\n\n446\n00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.240\nTarget attribute is\ngonna be cloud filtered.\n\n447\n00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.185\nCloud filtered instead.\n\n448\n00:25:04.185 --> 00:25:07.598\nAnd then, under the source,\nthis is gonna be true.\n\n449\n00:25:11.034 --> 00:25:14.680\nAll right, from that point,\nI'm gonna click add.\n\n450\n00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.200\nAnd that should save my rule.\n\n451\n00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.590\nSo that's the idea of\ngenerating this role.\n\n452\n00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.860\nNow if you're actually going,\nman that's a lot of stuff, right.\n\n453\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.020\nyeah, this is not for the faint-hearted.\n\n454\n00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.490\nIf you're doing this by\nthe single attribute, okay,\n\n455\n00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.670\nyou can imagine you know exactly\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n456\n00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.310\nIf you're like me, and\nyou simply just followed steps and\n\n457\n00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.950\nyou kind of understand what we're doing.\n\n458\n00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.620\nWe're trying to make sure that that\none user isn't being synchronized.\n\n459\n00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.570\nSo could I take an entire OU and\nsync up everything and\n\n460\n00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.480\nthen say, I want to come back and I want\nto make sure that Ronnie isn't filtered,\n\n461\n00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.670\nisn't synchronized, we can do that.\n\n462\n00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.070\nBut you have to know\nexactly what you're doing.\n\n463\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:56.100\nSo that's a little bit more than just\nthe idea of going the extra step,\n\n464\n00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.300\nis somebody that really knows exactly\nwhat it is that they're trying to\n\n465\n00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.940\nmake sure that doesn't\nget synced up there.\n\n466\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.130\nSo, remember that you can do\nthe same thing, essentially,\n\n467\n00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.650\nwith an outbound rule as well.\n\n468\n00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.690\nAnd so, when you're doing that,\nyou're, actually, saying, hey,\n\n469\n00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.660\npull that from the Azure Active Directory,\nand\n\n470\n00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.280\nlet's make sure that it doesn't ever\nsynch down here to my on-premises too.\n\n471\n00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.520\nSo, those are also things that you have\nto realize that can end up happening.\n\n472\n00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.140\nSo, there may be objects\nthat you have created inside\n\n473\n00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.050\nof Office 365 before the synchronization\never happened, okay?\n\n474\n00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.180\nAnd if something like that is\nactually happening, you may go,\n\n475\n00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.220\nI really didn't need that,\nthat was just a test account that I made.\n\n476\n00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.840\nBut right now we're in the middle\nof syncing up, I need to go and\n\n477\n00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.830\nfilter that thing out anyway so\nit doesn't actually ever come back.\n\n478\n00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.198\nThen you can also do that too.\n\n479\n00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:43.440\nBut remember that those things,\nmay not actually stay in place.\n\n480\n00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.100\nWhereas the inbound will\nalways permanently be there,\n\n481\n00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.190\nuntil you're ready to remove that\nthicker filter at an point in time.\n\n482\n00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.380\nSo there are objects.\n\n483\n00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.420\nThere are ways that we can use this\nthing to be able to filter out.\n\n484\n00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.320\nUnderstanding and\n\n485\n00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.370\nfiguring out what you want to filter\nout before the synchronization happens.\n\n486\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.900\nIt is probably one of the best\nthings that you can do,\n\n487\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.710\nwhen you actually are starting\nto have that process here.\n\n488\n00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.510\nThe more that you can eliminate as far as\nissues and problems go at the beginning.\n\n489\n00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.430\nThe better off you are going to be, so\n\n490\n00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:18.730\nbe ready to use either the domain\nsynchronization or the OU filtering.\n\n491\n00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.640\nAnd even the attribute\nfiltering if need to, but\n\n492\n00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.300\nremember that you have those choices,\nright.\n\n493\n00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.400\nSo different ways you can filter Active\nDirectory out before the synchronization,\n\n494\n00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.680\nduring and even after it, if you choose\nto as well, but doing it before is\n\n495\n00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.850\nplanning ahead, doing exactly the way\nthat Office 365 would like you to do it.\n\n496\n00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.100\n>> Yeah, it's excellent stuff, Ronnie.\n\n497\n00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.740\nAnd I know it did get a little bit\nintense there at the end with all those\n\n498\n00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.322\nattributes.\n\n499\n00:27:41.322 --> 00:27:43.230\nIt can, can feel like you're\ndrinking from a fire hose.\n\n500\n00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.440\n>> Yes.\n>> Because there's so\n\n501\n00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.430\nmany things that you have to know.\n\n502\n00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.460\nDo I need this or do I need that?\n\n503\n00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.560\nThat kind of thing will come with\nknowing your directory service, right?\n\n504\n00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.410\nKnowing Active Directory, the environment\nthat you're in, all the attributes there,\n\n505\n00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.010\nwhat do you commonly work with.\n\n506\n00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.980\nYou're going to know the outliers\nthat are in your system\n\n507\n00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.010\nthat are going to take\nsome special attention.\n\n508\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.440\nSo, don't think of it as, oh man, there's\nno way I can get through that entire list.\n\n509\n00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.340\nYou're already kind of already\nhave a rough idea of where to go,\n\n510\n00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.050\nthen you just need to figure\nout the system itself.\n\n511\n00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:15.240\nNow Ronnie is there anything else that\nwe need to cover when it comes to\n\n512\n00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.630\nsetting up filtering?\n\n513\n00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.050\n>> Well not in setting up filtering,\nbut remember this whole step is\n\n514\n00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:23.620\npart of that planning process,\nright, as you get ready for\n\n515\n00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.190\neverything to get connected in there\n>> Preparation is your best friend.\n\n516\n00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.750\nTrying to figure it out\nafter the preparation.\n\n517\n00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.850\nIn other words without the preparation,\nyou can.\n\n518\n00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.020\nDon't get me wrong, people have\ndone it and then like, oh yeah,\n\n519\n00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.320\nI made this mistake.\n\n520\n00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.750\nWe'll fix it later.\n\n521\n00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.840\nThat stuff can happen,\n\n522\n00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.340\nbut it is a headache and\na nightmare to do it that way.\n\n523\n00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.620\nBut they do give you work arounds to do\nit, and it takes a lot longer doing it\n\n524\n00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.790\nthat way, so make sure you\nalways think about preparing.\n\n525\n00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.700\nFiltering is gonna be the easiest way\nto get the synchronization happen\n\n526\n00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.065\nvery quickly, rather than get it\nto happen over a period of days.\n\n527\n00:28:58.065 --> 00:28:59.835\nAnd I mean days.\n\n528\n00:28:59.835 --> 00:29:03.735\nSo, make sure you do pay attention\nto filtering out these objects.\n\n529\n00:29:03.735 --> 00:29:08.095\n>> Almost always is it better to\nbe proactive instead of reactive.\n\n530\n00:29:08.095 --> 00:29:10.185\nThat being said, Ronnie,\na lot of good stuff today.\n\n531\n00:29:10.185 --> 00:29:11.860\nI hope you guys enjoyed this show.\n\n532\n00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.610\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie, and\n\n533\n00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:18.670\nwalking us down a very confusing\npath maybe for the uninitiated.\n\n534\n00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.960\nBut now you should be good to go,\nyou should be up to speed and\n\n535\n00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.300\nshouldn't be such a bear for you.\n\n536\n00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.710\nWe thank you guys for\nwatching we're going to close the show for\n\n537\n00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.970\nthe day I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n538\n00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.416\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n539\n00:29:28.416 --> 00:29:36.810\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV!\n\n3\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.240\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.570\nour Office 365 identities and requirements\nseries that we've been working on.\n\n5\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.716\nJoining me again to lend his expertise on\nthat very topic, well you know who he is.\n\n6\n00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:32.315\nHe's our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong,\nRonnie welcome back to the show.\n\n7\n00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:33.570\nHow are you doing today sir?\n\n8\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.010\n>> Well, thank you for having me back.\n\n9\n00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.000\nAnd as we continue on taking a look at\nOffice 365, and today we are jumping into\n\n10\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.540\nsetting up the tools that are really going\nto help us to ensure that our on-premises\n\n11\n00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.870\nActive Directory, as well as Office\n365's way of keeping track of users and\n\n12\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.750\nobjects are going to sync up and\ndo what we need to do.\n\n13\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.100\nSo, in previous episodes we\nreally did talk about the idea of\n\n14\n00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.040\nplanning this thing out, and making sure\nthat we get our own active directory,\n\n15\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.040\nour on-premises active directory ready for\nthat synchronization to happen.\n\n16\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.030\nThis is a very important concept for\nus as we move from the idea of piloting,\n\n17\n00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.050\nof course then into this active\nphase where we are now ready for\n\n18\n00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.160\nour users to get enrolled in, and\nto do everything that we need to.\n\n19\n00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.540\nSo, when we start to talk about\nactually developing this and\n\n20\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.350\ngetting it ready to go There's really\ngoing to be one tool that we end up using.\n\n21\n00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.240\nIn the very beginning, it actually\nended up being like two separate\n\n22\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.940\ntools that you would end up using.\n\n23\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.570\nI guess it almost is two\nseparate tools still, but\n\n24\n00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.970\nthis tool that we have now is actually\na bit more developed, a bit more\n\n25\n00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.400\non par with what you would actually expect\nfor a production environment to run in.\n\n26\n00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.040\nWhereas the other ones were kind of\nlike beta test, and they would work but\n\n27\n00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.240\nthey wouldn't work fully and then you'd\nhave to do some of these other things.\n\n28\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.710\nSo over a period of time,\n\n29\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.520\nthe tool that we're talking about is what\nwe call a directory synchronization tool,\n\n30\n00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.110\nand so the years have passed and\nyou might have heard of different terms.\n\n31\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.580\nIf you've heard of the term dirsync,\nD-I-R-S-Y-N-C\n\n32\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.610\nthat tool had been around for a long time,\nand it was really kinda the basic\n\n33\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.460\ntool that we use to ensure that\nsynchronization would begin to happen.\n\n34\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.540\nThen after a while, of course, it turned\ninto the Azure Active Directory Sync tool,\n\n35\n00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.070\nand that's what the title of this episode\nis actually called, but more recently and\n\n36\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.650\nI, when I say more recently I'm gonna\nsay in the last couple of months.\n\n37\n00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.230\nSo outside of the exam objectives\n\n38\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.750\nthis is now turned into the azure\nactive directory connect tool.\n\n39\n00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.520\nSo when you hear about all three of those\n\n40\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.360\nthey're really just about referring\nto the same thing, and but\n\n41\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.310\na little bit more developed each and\nevery time is what you're hearing.\n\n42\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.730\nSo the reason I wanted to mention that\nright, as we are, are preparing ourselves\n\n43\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.570\nfor that 70-346 exam,\nyou might see a smattering of all three,\n\n44\n00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.470\nand that's actually gonna be important,\nbut remember when it comes down\n\n45\n00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.160\nto directory synchronization All three\nof the tools will get it accomplished.\n\n46\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.580\nThe problem that you and\nI will have if we're actually just working\n\n47\n00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.070\nwith the Dir Sync or\nthe Active Directory or\n\n48\n00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.650\nthe AAD sync tool,\nis that those two are no longer supported.\n\n49\n00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.740\nIn other words, even though you\nmight be able to use them and\n\n50\n00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.420\nstill accomplish the same things\nwe're gonna be talking about.\n\n51\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.290\nWell, Microsoft is no longer\nsupporting in them Office 365,\n\n52\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.740\nand Azure's no longer actually\nmaking regular builds to them,\n\n53\n00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.940\nkeeping them updated,\ndoing all that stuff.\n\n54\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.215\nThey've pretty much turned everything over\nto the latest edition Which is going to be\n\n55\n00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:42.205\nthe Acer directory connect tool, and\nthat's the tool that we'll be using here,\n\n56\n00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:44.975\nin our shows as we\ncontinue to move forward.\n\n57\n00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:49.005\nNow, don't forget that on the exam you\nmay see questions from all three, but\n\n58\n00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:51.215\nremember that they also update the exam,\nand so\n\n59\n00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:54.955\nwe're going to see that pretty much the\ntool doesn't really change in terms of its\n\n60\n00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:58.880\nlooks too much, but the functionality\nthough has changed over a period of time,\n\n61\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.720\nand you'll see that this is a more\ncomplete tool whereas before\n\n62\n00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.270\nthere were actually not as complete and\nso we gotta get used to that.\n\n63\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.250\nThose are the things that really can trip\nyou up in the exam, so just make sure that\n\n64\n00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.830\nin your mind you connect all three of\nthose as actually being the same tool, and\n\n65\n00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.100\nI think that will help you out as\nyou're actually preparing, okay.\n\n66\n00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.400\nSo, as we start talking\nabout using a tool,\n\n67\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.880\nDaniel, like anything else that I do,\nright?\n\n68\n00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.930\nIt's just, all right, it's a tool.\n\n69\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.150\nI download it, I simply double click on it\nand I run through the menu and I'm fine.\n\n70\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.930\nThat sounds like the way that we\nwould normally do things, right?\n\n71\n00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.940\n>> Yeah, that's usually how I get down.\n\n72\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.420\nIf I want a tool and I want to use it,\nI would find out where to get,\n\n73\n00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.040\nobtain a copy of it.\n\n74\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.200\nRun the installation and then once it's\ndone, start using it toward my benefit.\n\n75\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.150\n>> And that is exactly what you would\nthink would happen here on this tool.\n\n76\n00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.920\nIt's not a huge download but what it\nactually does when we get this tool and\n\n77\n00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.210\nit's ready to go, right, is that you're\nactually downloading a very lightweight\n\n78\n00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.120\nversion of something that is called\nthe FIM is what it's actually called,\n\n79\n00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.710\nand I was sitting there like,\n\"What is the FIM?\" Well that of course is\n\n80\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.866\nan abbreviation for\nthe forefront identity manager 2010.\n\n81\n00:05:07.866 --> 00:05:13.460\nNow where as that is an entire\nsuite of everything that\n\n82\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.620\nyou can do to help you manage identities\nof course on the edge as well as inside.\n\n83\n00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.270\nWell, the way that they did\nthat is that they took that and\n\n84\n00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.170\nthey essentially limited that,\nin other words,\n\n85\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.850\nturned it into really a single\nkind of purpose environment, so\n\n86\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.750\nthat it actually does this synchronization\nbetween your on premises Active Directory,\n\n87\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.330\nand then your whatever cloud service\nyou're going to, and what we're talking\n\n88\n00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.570\nabout of course, is the Azure active\ndirectory structure behind Office 365.\n\n89\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.400\nSo when we talk about that\nin terms of virtualization,\n\n90\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.925\nwe hear the term virtual\nappliance a lot of times,\n\n91\n00:05:47.925 --> 00:05:53.990\nathat's what's actually running on your\nmachine if you choose to do this, right?\n\n92\n00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.980\nSo that is the main tool\nthat we're talking about.\n\n93\n00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.980\nSo even it's a very small install,\n\n94\n00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.060\nit's a very intensive install\nas well to make that happen.\n\n95\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.370\nSo we need to understand that too, and\nso that's kind of the reason why we're\n\n96\n00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.030\ntaking our time and really gonna be\ndiscussing this particular tool as well.\n\n97\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.060\nNow before we get into this let's\nmake sure that we understand that\n\n98\n00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.960\nwhen we actually choose to do something\nlike active directory synchronization, and\n\n99\n00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.590\nwhen we choose to use this\ntool there are some things we\n\n100\n00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.070\nabsolutely need to find out and\nneed to follow the best practices in.\n\n101\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.230\nSo let me show you what\nwe're talking about as well.\n\n102\n00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.500\nSo here on my machine I went in and\nmade this diagram for\n\n103\n00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.490\nus so that we can see it\na little bit easier here.\n\n104\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.600\nSo remember that before synchronization,\nright, this is the way that you and\n\n105\n00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.320\nI work with inside of our own active\ndirectory, as well as Office 365.\n\n106\n00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.160\nA user of course then, whatever\ndevice that he's on, if he is also\n\n107\n00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.060\nconnecting in to his on premises, the\nnetwork that he's used to connecting to,\n\n108\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.680\nhe'll have to provide a username and\npassword for that.\n\n109\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.210\nPerfectly fine, great,\nworks well that way.\n\n110\n00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.980\nThen when he connects to Office 365\nhe'll normally also have to provide\n\n111\n00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.410\nanother separate username and\npassword for that.\n\n112\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.330\nEssentially a single user now having\nreally two different identities, one so\n\n113\n00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.670\nthey can get access to Office 365,\nthen another one so he can\n\n114\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.650\nget access to his on premises, resources\nthat he really needs to be able to get to.\n\n115\n00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.730\nWhat usually the goal of course then\nbehind wanting to do a synchronization\n\n116\n00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.820\nbetween the two, is that you actually\nhave to figure that out sometimes.\n\n117\n00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.160\nThat's what we need to talk about too.\n\n118\n00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.360\nSo, when we talk about the idea of best\npractices here, let me see if I can\n\n119\n00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.510\nmake that just a little bit larger for\nus here, and that way we'll be able to see\n\n120\n00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.080\nit a little bit better, oops,\nlet me not drag it off the screen here,\n\n121\n00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.060\ndrag it back on the screen here, and that\nwe'll make it a little bit easier okay.\n\n122\n00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.546\nSo know what you're trying to accomplish\nand that is pretty much the key.\n\n123\n00:07:51.546 --> 00:07:56.662\nThe nice thing is, the tool that used to\nactually exist inside of Dirsync right,\n\n124\n00:07:56.662 --> 00:08:01.797\nthat we would have, it would give us the\nability to do one thing but not the other.\n\n125\n00:08:01.797 --> 00:08:06.554\nSo when we talked, know what we're trying\nto accomplish Is it that I am just\n\n126\n00:08:06.554 --> 00:08:10.950\ntrying to ensure that my user only\nhas one sign on in this way, right?\n\n127\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.600\nIn other words they're sharing\nthe same user name and password.\n\n128\n00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.400\nSo, they log into the on\npremises active directory,\n\n129\n00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.300\nthey're using the same user name and\npassword there.\n\n130\n00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.260\nIf they go and log into Office 365\nthey're using the same password there.\n\n131\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.130\nSo, its not really that we're\nactually doing a single sign on.\n\n132\n00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.660\nBut it actually mimics a single\nsign on in that way, right?\n\n133\n00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.130\nSo I'm just saying we're using the same\nusername and password between those two,\n\n134\n00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.010\nand we can do that synchronization\nto allow that to happen.\n\n135\n00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.020\nBut it's still really in two different\nstructures of Active Directory\n\n136\n00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.250\nwhen we do that.\n\n137\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.930\nSo that may be what we want to accomplish,\nokay?\n\n138\n00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:47.350\nThe other window is actually\nimplementing a single sign on.\n\n139\n00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.420\nWhen we talk about implementing\na single sign-on what\n\n140\n00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.710\nwe're saying is I'm going to log\nin to only one of those locations.\n\n141\n00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.380\nSo let's say I'm going to log in to\nmy Active Directory on premises.\n\n142\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.300\nWhat we're actually saying at that point\nis I don't need to actually log in again\n\n143\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:09.080\nif I go to Office 365 so I can also\nimplement that depending on what we need.\n\n144\n00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.720\nSo in that sense right at the beginning\nbefore I go, let me just do\n\n145\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.040\na synchronization, I need to decide those\ntwo I really want to accomplish and\n\n146\n00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.720\nthe reason why this tool is actually\nsomething that will help us to do that.\n\n147\n00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.990\nNow if you happen to be\nrunning that older tool and\n\n148\n00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.960\nsome of us may not have change\nover to the newest one, but\n\n149\n00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.870\njust kind of trust me here that\nif you're running the older tool,\n\n150\n00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.450\nif you have a single domain and\nall you're choosing to do is say,\n\n151\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.790\nlook, I'm gonna use the same password,\nsame username in both locations.\n\n152\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.260\nThen I can run [INAUDIBLE].\n\n153\n00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.870\nOkay makes perfect sense.\n\n154\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.790\nNow, then you would think that you\nknow what also makes perfect sense is\n\n155\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.690\nthat tool.\n\n156\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.000\nThen if I had, well let's say that\nI wanted to do a single sign on,\n\n157\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.430\nyou would use that same tool right?\n\n158\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.230\n>> That would seem logically [INAUDIBLE].\n\n159\n00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.740\n>> Yeah.\n\n160\n00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.000\nYou would think that that'd\nbe the way to go, okay.\n\n161\n00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.230\nThat that same tool would do it.\n\n162\n00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.850\nBut of course In that day and\nage when DirSync was actually\n\n163\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.280\npretty much the king of the hill in\ndoing this you didn't use that tool.\n\n164\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.080\nYou actually had to install\nForefront Identity Manager\n\n165\n00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.530\nif you were gonna do that instead as well.\n\n166\n00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.010\nSo you had to decide right off the bat.\n\n167\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.880\nThe nice thing is, today though, with\nthe new Active Directory Connect tool.\n\n168\n00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.140\nYou don't have to worry about it.\n\n169\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.990\nThe same tool will actually allow you to\nmake a choice then during the install, and\n\n170\n00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.520\nwe'll see that as we go through and\ninstall it, too.\n\n171\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.070\nSo you do need to figure out\nwhat you wanna accomplish.\n\n172\n00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:34.440\nNow, the time to figure that out, right,\nis not while you're actually clicking and\n\n173\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.040\nclicking next to go, hmm, I wonder\nwhich one I should think about now?\n\n174\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.080\nNow that you've got 1,000 users waiting or\n\n175\n00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.810\n500 users waiting,\nwhich one you're actually going to do\n\n176\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.770\nbecause one does actually take a bit\nore setup than the other, right.\n\n177\n00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.050\nSo if you actually have only\nyou're doing the password,\n\n178\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.010\nthat's actually gonna sync up a lot\nfaster than if you go we're gonna\n\n179\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.650\nimplement a single between two separate\ndomains using only one set of credentials.\n\n180\n00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.530\nThat's gonna take a bit more time.\n\n181\n00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:06.610\nSo plan this out, talk to whoever you\nneed to, know what it is your goal is at\n\n182\n00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.270\nthe very beginning before you\nstart running this, okay?\n\n183\n00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.580\nSecondly of course, we also mentioned\nthis in another show, right.\n\n184\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.940\nKnow what needs to be synchronized and\nwhat doesn't need to be synchronized.\n\n185\n00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.480\nRemember that inside of your\nActive Directory over years\n\n186\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.130\nthis thing has grown and\ngrown and grown, and\n\n187\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.700\nsometimes all you're really doing is that\nyou want to provide the access to these\n\n188\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.240\nusers that need Office 365, but\nnot every object in active directory\n\n189\n00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.630\nneeds to also be synchronized\nup to Azure's active directory.\n\n190\n00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.240\nNow, can you do that if you want to?\n\n191\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.350\nAbsolutely.\n\n192\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.400\nIs that gonna take a ton more time for\nyou to do that?\n\n193\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.160\nYou better believe it's gonna take\nmore time than you realize if\n\n194\n00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.030\nyou're trying to implement\nsomething like that as well.\n\n195\n00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.440\nSo at this point we are asking, right?\n\n196\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.480\nAs far as the best practice goes.\n\n197\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.610\nKnow what it is that you\nreally need to synchronize and\n\n198\n00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.550\nthen from that point on right?\n\n199\n00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.410\nWe can use some of the filtering\nof our Active Directory.\n\n200\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.700\nAnd we did do an episode on this so\nmake sure you check out\n\n201\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.640\nthe course library on this when we\ntalk about filtering the content.\n\n202\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.030\nThat we can filter by the domain, okay.\n\n203\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.000\nWe can filter by OUs,\nand if you're really,\n\n204\n00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.700\nreally deciding super tight\nintricacies of your Active Directory.\n\n205\n00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.060\nYou can even filter out by\nattributes if you choose to as well.\n\n206\n00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.330\nAnd that way those things don't\nhave to be synchronized too.\n\n207\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.170\nSo it just depends what\nyou need synchronized but\n\n208\n00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.090\nyou need to decide that\nbeforehand as well.\n\n209\n00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:34.310\nSo everything actually seems to be on\nhand and also ready to go in that way.\n\n210\n00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.980\nNow the other one that we also talk about\nhere in the most generic Microsoft terms\n\n211\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.370\nKinda understanding capacity planning.\n\n212\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.090\nNow capacity planning, are they saying\nthat we're limited by the number of users?\n\n213\n00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.350\nNot necessarily.\n\n214\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.410\nWhat they're saying, though, is the number\nof objects inside of Active Directory,\n\n215\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.380\nyou've got to actually think about here.\n\n216\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.100\nOkay?\n\n217\n00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.070\nWhen you go ahead and run something like\nDirSync and even the Active Directory\n\n218\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.730\nconnect tool, you're perfectly fine doing\nwhat they call the express setting.\n\n219\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.720\nWhich is just run through as quickly\nas possible, ask me as few questions as\n\n220\n00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.530\npossible, let the synchronization\nhappen the way that it needs to.\n\n221\n00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.080\nYou can run through that, but\nthe limitation here is simple.\n\n222\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.970\nIf you have less than 50,000\nobjects in your Active Directory,\n\n223\n00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.180\nIt will probably work just fine.\n\n224\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.710\nIt may take a little bit of time,\nbut it'll work just fine.\n\n225\n00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.180\nSomewhere between 50 and 300,000 though,\n\n226\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:30.290\nthis thing is gonna slow down and so\nthey want you to actually plan for\n\n227\n00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:35.520\nthat time as well and understand\nthe capacity that you have there.\n\n228\n00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.320\nNow you have over 300,000\nobjects this is where,\n\n229\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.466\nthe only place I know, that Microsoft\nsays, you need to call us, okay.\n\n230\n00:13:41.466 --> 00:13:45.140\nWith 300,000 or more, let us help you.\n\n231\n00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.000\nAnd Daniel, if we think about it,\nright, 300,000 objects.\n\n232\n00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.790\nBut there must be other complexities\nthere that they're saying look,\n\n233\n00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.650\nwe don't want you getting into it\nwith a single tool Let us help you,\n\n234\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.320\nwould you take advantage of that?\n\n235\n00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.550\n>> Oh heck yeah.\nTo be able to have, Microsoft's experts\n\n236\n00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.230\nsay, hey you know what, well what\nwe're gonna help you out with that.\n\n237\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:09.940\nWell by all means, please, especially when\nyou have an active directory that has\n\n238\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.049\nsomewhere in the range of\n300,000 different objects.\n\n239\n00:14:13.049 --> 00:14:14.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It can be really easy for\n\n240\n00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:19.170\nus to miss some things or not understand\nthat maybe they will cause problems.\n\n241\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.340\nWhere Microsoft experts are, well, just\nthat, they're experts at those types of\n\n242\n00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.650\nthings, especially when it comes to\nthat Migration into using Office 365.\n\n243\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.530\nThey've been there, they've done that.\n\n244\n00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.950\nLet's lean on their expertise\nwhenever they give us opportunities.\n\n245\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.670\nSo, I would take advantage of it even\nif I thought I could do it by myself.\n\n246\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.670\n>> Yeah, and that's something\nyou definitely want to do,\n\n247\n00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.460\nand they don't recommend this,\njust because they need you to, right?\n\n248\n00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.280\nThey recommend this because they're saying\nthat there are some other complexities.\n\n249\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.390\nOnce you get a high, but\nit's also about the capacity, right?\n\n250\n00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.000\nSo by default what happens here\nis that 50,000 is kind of like,\n\n251\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.430\nhere's where we're gonna start everybody\noff with, but as soon as you register your\n\n252\n00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:04.000\nDNS, your domain name that you're\nactually gonna register with Office 365,\n\n253\n00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.410\nthey automatically jump that object\nnumber up to the maximum of 300,000.\n\n254\n00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.400\nSo, in other words,\nyou don't have to go and\n\n255\n00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.150\ndo anything special between that 50 and\n100,000, but as soon as you register,\n\n256\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.200\nthey say look, this guy's registering\na DNS name, he's pretty serious here.\n\n257\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.550\nLet's go ahead and jump him up and\ngive him up to about 300,000.\n\n258\n00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.360\nOnce you have that, they also in\nthe background of the infrastructure\n\n259\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.230\nof Azure's Active Directory and\neverything else.\n\n260\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:29.310\nThey have to say what?\n\n261\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.470\nWe need to bump that up and\nactually expand that out too.\n\n262\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.170\nAnd then we'll also help them\nin the process to make sure\n\n263\n00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.640\neverything gets in there\nthe way it needs to.\n\n264\n00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.150\nSo it's something that you definitely\nwant to take advantage of as well.\n\n265\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.340\nNow the other thing here in the capacity\nplanning that we need to talk about\n\n266\n00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.450\nis just some hardware requirements too.\n\n267\n00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.782\nAnd this was something I\nwas pointing out to Daniel,\n\n268\n00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.963\nI think maybe it was yesterday or\nthe day before.\n\n269\n00:15:50.963 --> 00:15:54.392\nThat this tool, as small as it is,\nit's like a 70 or\n\n270\n00:15:54.392 --> 00:15:59.735\n80 megabyte utility that you download\nwhen you actually have a up to 50,000\n\n271\n00:15:59.735 --> 00:16:04.880\nobjects it requires a machine that you're\nrunning on that four gigs of memory.\n\n272\n00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.652\nOkay, pretty hefty when you think about\na machine that has 4 gigs of memory for\n\n273\n00:16:08.652 --> 00:16:12.138\nthis little program that you downloaded\nand you installed and was like,\n\n274\n00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:15.030\nit's 80 megabytes,\nwhat the heck is going on?\n\n275\n00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.730\nWell remember that if it's actually\ngonna be doing that synchronization,\n\n276\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.620\nit's saying it can pull\nup to 50,000 objects and\n\n277\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.580\nstore them where while it's synchronizing,\nin RAM.\n\n278\n00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.940\nSo that's pretty hefty.\n\n279\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.200\nAnd then once you get I think\nit's 150,000 or above objects,\n\n280\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.850\nI think it's at that point that it\nrequires you to have 16 gigs of RAM.\n\n281\n00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:38.990\nSo it doesn't seem to go 4,\n8, 12, it just says, yeah,\n\n282\n00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:45.033\nonce you get above this 150 or so then\nwe're gonna jump up to 16 gigs of RAM.\n\n283\n00:16:45.033 --> 00:16:48.170\nSo it just seems like either\nbare minimum is 4, and\n\n284\n00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.740\nthat's what you have to remember,\nand of course up 16 if\n\n285\n00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.519\nyou have more objects than that for\njust the hardware requirement.\n\n286\n00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:59.590\nSo just kinda remember, RAM is actually\nvery important as far as when the hardware\n\n287\n00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.870\nprerequisite set we have there too.\n\n288\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.970\nSo that's the capacity planning that we're\nalso talking about as well, all right.\n\n289\n00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.230\nNow of course getting our\nActive Directory ready, okay.\n\n290\n00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.960\nAnd this is another episode that we also\ncovered here, the idea of planning for\n\n291\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.250\nActive Directory, and we showed in\nanother episode that there can be objects\n\n292\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.920\nthat have actually occurred over time and\nerrors that get into Active Directory.\n\n293\n00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.640\nSo remember that you wanna ensure that\nyou go through your Active Directory and\n\n294\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.070\nput in place all those things\nthat will make the transition and\n\n295\n00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.830\nthe synchronization smoother.\n\n296\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.360\nAnd the thing that we were\nmaking fun of a little bit,\n\n297\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.830\nright, is that if this happens\nwith hundreds of objects or\n\n298\n00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.200\nthousands of objects, manually going\nin and doing it, terrible, okay?\n\n299\n00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.980\nBut, Daniel, I did show that there\nwere a couple of tools, right,\n\n300\n00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.710\nthat we have available, and the nice\nthing about the tool, Daniel, is what?\n\n301\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.930\nIs we just go, all right, let's run it,\nand then it just shows us the errors and\n\n302\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.560\nwe are ready then to either\nmanually fix them, or\n\n303\n00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.240\nthose tools can also be able to\nfix the ones that they can fix.\n\n304\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.740\nSometimes you'll still have to manually go\nback and get that, but just kinda remember\n\n305\n00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.940\nthat will you will have to fix\nthose Active Directory issues too.\n\n306\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.260\nSo there's always something.\n\n307\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.787\nSo just when you think, like I did,\nright, first time I'm looking at it, and\n\n308\n00:18:09.787 --> 00:18:11.294\nI remember this with [INAUDIBLE].\n\n309\n00:18:11.294 --> 00:18:13.386\nI don't have to worry about it,\nit's just a tool, it runs,\n\n310\n00:18:13.386 --> 00:18:15.190\nit's gonna synchronize, no big deal.\n\n311\n00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.623\nWell, it will spit out errors at you,\nand when it spits out errors,\n\n312\n00:18:18.623 --> 00:18:20.730\nit expects you to know what to do.\n\n313\n00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.410\nSo it's not just as simple as point and\nclick, download and you're ready to go and\n\n314\n00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:26.540\nlet it do its thing.\n\n315\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.980\nThere's still a lot of set up to go and\nyou can see why as well, okay?\n\n316\n00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.320\nAll right, last couple of points here,\nof course the DNS name, okay.\n\n317\n00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.370\nRemember that for\n\n318\n00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.940\nus there can be domains inside of our\nnetwork that are not routed, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:44.890\nSo if you do have a domain that ends\nin .local or one that is like me,\n\n320\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.570\nI have a test lab domain.\n\n321\n00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.095\nThe very fact is you may never have\nthat connected to the Internet, but\n\n322\n00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:52.840\nwhat if you do have users in there,\nthat you go, look,\n\n323\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.760\nthese are actually y'all\ngonna need the Office 365.\n\n324\n00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.150\nWell you can either switch them over\nto another domain name or you can use\n\n325\n00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:05.270\na UPN suffix as well, and that actually\nhelps to smooth that transition over too.\n\n326\n00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.710\nSo just remember that you need to plan for\nthat, and then\n\n327\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.200\nlastly this idea of not Multiple Forests I\nshould say, but multiple domains.\n\n328\n00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.974\nSo it's just me having bad typo\nday is what we have, all right?\n\n329\n00:19:16.974 --> 00:19:19.210\nSo what if you have more than one domain?\n\n330\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.530\nOkay, you need to plan for that too.\n\n331\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.030\nSo remember if you were using DirSync and\nyou had multiple domains,\n\n332\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.180\nyou would also have to go to\na different utility which was also that\n\n333\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.570\nForefront Identity Manager to be able\nto run from multiple domains as well.\n\n334\n00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.650\nDirSync only handled a single domain,\nbut the new Active Directory Connect\n\n335\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.380\ntool though, that actually allows\nyou to do multiple domains too.\n\n336\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.750\nSo it is very important that\nwe have that idea going, okay?\n\n337\n00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.010\nSo once that's actually done, and\n\n338\n00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:51.220\nyou've got everything ready to go except\nthis point, we could take a look at\n\n339\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.940\nleast at the basic install of what\nwe're actually gonna talk about.\n\n340\n00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.200\nNow I'm gonna actually use a couple\nof different domains to help us out,\n\n341\n00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.420\ncuz I staged it because the install and\neverything else, right,\n\n342\n00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.772\ntakes a bit of time.\n\n343\n00:20:03.772 --> 00:20:05.920\nIt's kinda boring cuz all\nyou're doing is watching what,\n\n344\n00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.120\na bar kinda go across the screen here.\n\n345\n00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.467\nBut we do wanna show you the install\nprocess of this particular tool and\n\n346\n00:20:12.467 --> 00:20:13.431\nutility here.\n\n347\n00:20:17.363 --> 00:20:20.865\nSo I'm gonna log in to this\nparticular domain controller here and\n\n348\n00:20:20.865 --> 00:20:25.258\nwhat you're gonna actually end up doing\nhere is you're gonna download a couple of\n\n349\n00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:27.330\ndifferent things, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:36.248\nIf you already have the Windows Active\nDirectory Module for PowerShell installed,\n\n351\n00:20:36.248 --> 00:20:40.030\nokay, then you don't have to worry\nabout a couple of these processes here.\n\n352\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.250\nAnd we've already done that in another\nepisode, but normally you actually need\n\n353\n00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:47.370\nthis tool which gets you connected\nto Microsoft Online, okay?\n\n354\n00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:52.000\nAnd then you actually have to download\nthis utility here, that gives you that\n\n355\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.470\nWindows Azure Active Directory Module for\nPowerShell installed as well.\n\n356\n00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:58.010\nSo that has to be installed, so\n\n357\n00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.110\nthat's one of the prerequisites there\nis that you have to have that there.\n\n358\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.470\nThen you can go out and find your\nfavorite search engine here and look for\n\n359\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:08.910\nthe Azure AD Connect, okay?\n\n360\n00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.610\nAnd from that point you download that, and\nthen you simply run it and there it goes.\n\n361\n00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.190\nIt looks like it's actually preparing\nan install, and we are running it, and\n\n362\n00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.420\nwe are ready to go, okay?\n\n363\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.010\nSo the installation process looks like\nit runs through, works perfectly well.\n\n364\n00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.780\nIn the background here, and\n\n365\n00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.520\nwe're actually gonna follow the menu\nsetting through just a little bit briefly.\n\n366\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.410\nNotice it tells us to run this\ninstallation tool on the server where\n\n367\n00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.160\nsynchronization service\ncomponents will be installed.\n\n368\n00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.893\nNow in a lab environment you can\nrun this on a domain control,\n\n369\n00:21:40.893 --> 00:21:43.840\nokay, and so\nthat's what we're actually doing.\n\n370\n00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.250\nIn a real production environment\nthey recommend another server,\n\n371\n00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.210\nstrangely they don't\nrecommend a workstation.\n\n372\n00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.440\nWhy, because most workstations\nprobably are not gonna have 4 or\n\n373\n00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.620\n16 gigs of RAM, but\nyou can do it if you choose to.\n\n374\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.240\nBut just kinda remember\nthe physical hardware requirements\n\n375\n00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.530\nare gonna be important.\n\n376\n00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:05.570\nThe other thing, of course, is that\nthe server needs to part of the domain\n\n377\n00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.940\nthat you're also going to be transferring\nup there for the synchronization.\n\n378\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.140\nSo you wanna make sure that\nyou have that there as well.\n\n379\n00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:18.780\nAnd then, of course,\nthere's a couple of other things as well,\n\n380\n00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.650\nwhich is actually gonna be permission\nissues that we tend to face too.\n\n381\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:27.500\nSo when we start doing this\nidea of making the connection,\n\n382\n00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.510\nthere's a couple of accounts\nyou're gonna end up using.\n\n383\n00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.470\nOne, probably is the most standard\naccount, which is gonna be the tenant\n\n384\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:38.810\nadminister account, the one that we\nactually get into Office 365 with, okay?\n\n385\n00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:43.830\nTwo, the recommendation and the production\nnetwork is to create a service account for\n\n386\n00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.600\nthe synchronization, right?\n\n387\n00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.810\nSo remember what a service\naccount helps us to do, right?\n\n388\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.610\nIt actually gives us the ability to\nhave that particular account and\n\n389\n00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.940\nwe're not gonna allow\nthe password to expire.\n\n390\n00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.960\nAnd then we need to assign some\npermissions to that account if we're\n\n391\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.130\ngonna do this.\n\n392\n00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:02.050\nNow remember that this particular service\naccount is gonna be very important for\n\n393\n00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.520\nus because if it's doing\nthe synchronization,\n\n394\n00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.680\nit's having to do it in the background and\nit's staying connected all the time.\n\n395\n00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.100\nSo if you are to use just a regular\ndomain administrator account\n\n396\n00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.940\nit doesn't work, okay?\n\n397\n00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.360\nThis particular account also needs to\nbe an enterprise admin account as well\n\n398\n00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.700\nbecause it is making major\nchanges in both locations.\n\n399\n00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.490\nSo just kinda realize that this particular\naccount you're gonna need to make part of\n\n400\n00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:32.120\nthe domain admin's group, not domain,\nenterprise admin's group,\n\n401\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.160\nif you're going to do this and\nyou're gonna use this here, okay?\n\n402\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.060\nSo we need to make sure we have those\npermissions ready too, all right?\n\n403\n00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.490\nNow at the very beginning here,\n\n404\n00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.780\nthis is where it can be confusing if we're\ngonna be installing this particular tool.\n\n405\n00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.690\nAnd we might get to a certain part\nof this and we might end up not\n\n406\n00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.620\nbeing able to do the whole thing right\naway, but let's take a look here, okay?\n\n407\n00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.238\nSo welcome here, we're actually ready\nto run this so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n408\n00:23:57.238 --> 00:23:59.630\nagree, and then click Continue here.\n\n409\n00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:04.510\nAnd right away, if it actually says, and\nit matches you, right, you have a single\n\n410\n00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:09.421\ndomain Single Active Directory,\nthe recommendation's fairly simple, right.\n\n411\n00:24:09.421 --> 00:24:11.704\nThey're Express Settings,\nlet it run through and\n\n412\n00:24:11.704 --> 00:24:15.421\nthis is as close as we're going to get to\njust saying double-click on it and click,\n\n413\n00:24:15.421 --> 00:24:17.372\nnext, next, next, next, okay?\n\n414\n00:24:17.372 --> 00:24:20.070\nWe'll still have to provide some\ncredentials, but overall though,\n\n415\n00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.350\nthat's the quickest aspect that we're\ngonna have, if we were to do that.\n\n416\n00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.530\nSo, it tells us it's gonna\nconfigure synchronization here,\n\n417\n00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.430\nand it's gonna configure this,\nand do all that, and continue on.\n\n418\n00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.280\nAnd than we just press the Express\nSettings, and it'll do everything and\n\n419\n00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.430\nthen we only have to add in more FI.\n\n420\n00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:39.630\nBut if you do have multiple domains,\ndo not choose Express Settings.\n\n421\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.900\nInstead choose customize and\n\n422\n00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.130\nit's here that you actually will\nhave this optional configuration.\n\n423\n00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.650\nNow, it doesn't mean you\nhave to use any of them, but\n\n424\n00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.642\nthis is actually important for us as well.\n\n425\n00:24:50.642 --> 00:24:55.315\nKnow that you can specify custom,\nyou can actually use an existing service\n\n426\n00:24:55.315 --> 00:24:58.220\naccount if you wanted to do this,\nright here.\n\n427\n00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:04.320\nSo I'm gonna do ITproTV Demo,\nactually I don't have it on this one.\n\n428\n00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.770\nSo I'm not gonna use that existing service\naccount on this one just to show you.\n\n429\n00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.820\nBut if you had that, that's what\nyou would end up doing right there.\n\n430\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.100\nAnd than all you have to do,\n\n431\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.460\nnotice I didn't check anything, you click\nInstall, and at this point it's going\n\n432\n00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.130\nto begin installing\nthe additional requirements here.\n\n433\n00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.960\nNotice it's also installing\nin a SQL database as well.\n\n434\n00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.070\nThe SQL server and\nthis is doing the express version.\n\n435\n00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:31.930\nYou have a larger one it's\ngoing to slow down and say,\n\n436\n00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.780\nlook I counted 100,000 objects here, you\nneed to actually install a version of SQL.\n\n437\n00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.240\nIt may also ask you to slow down and\ndo that.\n\n438\n00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.370\nEven though this is a simple little tool\nand utility, it knows exactly what it's\n\n439\n00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.360\nlooking for to install and\ndo everything else that it needs to.\n\n440\n00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:54.370\nNow I chose the more configurable option,\nbecause it seems easy on the express.\n\n441\n00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:55.780\nYou're just gonna enter in credentials,\nand\n\n442\n00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.940\nyou're just gonna agree in the end,\nis what you're gonna end up doing.\n\n443\n00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.230\nBut here on this one, notice it's asking\na couple of different options too.\n\n444\n00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.490\nNow, once it actually gets to\nrequired components, it's gonna ask,\n\n445\n00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.180\nhey what method do I want?\n\n446\n00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.250\nPassword synchronization\nis by far the simplest.\n\n447\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.130\nIf I knew that I'm gonna be doing Single\nSign-On a little bit later, I would choose\n\n448\n00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:19.620\nthis one instead, Federation with\nActive Directory Federation Services.\n\n449\n00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.240\nThen it gives me of course all the these\nother things that I want to do.\n\n450\n00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.320\nVery important if you do this,\nthat you make your choice here.\n\n451\n00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.770\nWe're only gonna do the simple one,\nbut just kinda realize that, yeah,\n\n452\n00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.770\nthis is actually something that's\ngonna be very important for\n\n453\n00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.370\nus if we're actually gonna do this here.\n\n454\n00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:42.290\nSo, you need to make a choice right then\nwhich one you're actually gonna plan for.\n\n455\n00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.340\nMultiple domains, are you gonna do\nSingle Sign-On, this is the way to go.\n\n456\n00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.430\nIt is much more intensive,\nif you choose to do that.\n\n457\n00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.280\nI'm just gonna do the password sync and\nthen click Next and\n\n458\n00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.810\nfrom that point this is where you enter\nin your credentials here for the AD sync.\n\n459\n00:26:55.810 --> 00:27:04.365\nSo this one is adminwong10 on Microsoft.\n\n460\n00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:13.282\nIf I can spell it, microsoft.com.\n\n461\n00:27:13.282 --> 00:27:15.825\nType in the password.\n\n462\n00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.000\nMake sure I spelled it correctly.\n\n463\n00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:27.760\nClick Next and it's gonna connect, of\ncourse, to Azure AD, make that connection,\n\n464\n00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.420\nexamine the domains,\nget everything that we want to, and\n\n465\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.680\nit is just trying to make sure\nwe have that same connection.\n\n466\n00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.708\nNotice it actually does take\nthat Active Directory here and\n\n467\n00:27:38.708 --> 00:27:42.470\nnow it's asking me what Active Directory\ndo I wanna start synchronizing.\n\n468\n00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:46.630\nNow at this point here, the rest of this,\nis identifying who, and\n\n469\n00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:50.730\nthen filtering options,\nand going on through that.\n\n470\n00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.650\nYou might think it actually might\njust take a few minutes here, but\n\n471\n00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:59.350\nit can take up to 72 hours to complete\nif the Active Directory is big enough.\n\n472\n00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.525\n>> Wow Ronnie,\nthat's not just waiting around for\n\n473\n00:28:01.525 --> 00:28:04.785\na couple of minutes there, I mean,\nthat's one thing, but 72 hours?\n\n474\n00:28:04.785 --> 00:28:06.505\nI don't think I've got enough coffee for\nthat one.\n\n475\n00:28:06.505 --> 00:28:07.925\n>> Yeah, and most of us aren't.\n\n476\n00:28:07.925 --> 00:28:10.625\nThe very fact is, at the very\nend it's going to ask whether or\n\n477\n00:28:10.625 --> 00:28:12.155\nnot we want to sync.\n\n478\n00:28:12.155 --> 00:28:16.675\nAnd if we're click happy, and\nDaniel knows I am mister click happy, and\n\n479\n00:28:16.675 --> 00:28:19.485\nyou don't realize it,\nit can just sit there at that screen,\n\n480\n00:28:19.485 --> 00:28:23.400\nand it just does everything, and\nthen it has to sync up everything.\n\n481\n00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.550\nAnd it can take a long time if your\nActive Directory is actually very big.\n\n482\n00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.970\nNow luckily for me,\nmy Active Directory isn't very large, but\n\n483\n00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:36.050\nat the same time it still can take a good\nten to 15 minutes just on the show, for\n\n484\n00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.910\nyou just sitting there like okay,\nwhen's this actually gonna work?\n\n485\n00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.760\nWe really are just gonna take\na look at that afterwards.\n\n486\n00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.790\nSo the very fact is we\nclick on through and\n\n487\n00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.090\nthen it will actually automatically\nstart to sync, if we were doing that.\n\n488\n00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.750\nThat is part of the process that\nwe definitely have to go through.\n\n489\n00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.743\nThere's a couple of other things that we\nwant to show you before even that happens.\n\n490\n00:28:58.743 --> 00:29:01.460\nAnd so,\nI just kind of showed you a mock up here.\n\n491\n00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:05.510\nIn our next segment as we get to this in\npart two, we're gonna have to go to that.\n\n492\n00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.760\nWe want to show you some of the other\nthings in the background that have to\n\n493\n00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.498\nbe in place as well, not just clicking\nthrough the tool, but actually showing you\n\n494\n00:29:12.498 --> 00:29:15.800\nsome of the other things that have to be\nset up before we even run the tool as\n\n495\n00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.979\nwell, and then we'll get connected in and\nshow you the results too.\n\n496\n00:29:18.979 --> 00:29:20.399\n>> Well, that ought to be\npretty good stuff, Ronnie.\n\n497\n00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:24.560\nI know all of us are looking forward to\nseeing the exciting conclusion of running\n\n498\n00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.057\nthe AAD sync tool or\nwhatever the case it is now.\n\n499\n00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:29.825\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Here they change the name on us again\n\n500\n00:29:29.825 --> 00:29:30.848\nby the time we get to part two.\n\n501\n00:29:30.848 --> 00:29:32.300\n>> [LAUGH] Could be.\n>> Yeah, that being\n\n502\n00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.170\nsaid Ronnie thank you for\nwhat you showed us so far.\n\n503\n00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.210\nLook forward to seeing you there and\nthank you for\n\n504\n00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:40.050\nwatching hopefully we'll\nsee in part two as well.\n\n505\n00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.870\nSigning off for ITproTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n506\n00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:43.550\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n507\n00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.830\n>> And we'll see you

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.890\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.330\nmanagering, managering\nthat's a funny word.\n\n5\n00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.240\nI always love to add to\nthe english language.\n\n6\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.680\nWe are managing Office 365 identities and\nrequirements.\n\n7\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.410\nJumping into a part two here\nbringing back, you know him,\n\n8\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.580\nyou love him, his name is Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.281\nRonnie, welcome back to the show,\nhow are you?\n\n10\n00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:40.532\n>> I'm doing great as we continue\non taking a look at how we get this\n\n11\n00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:43.050\nActive Directory sync tool.\n\n12\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.200\nAzure Active Directory sync tool set up so\n\n13\n00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.210\nthat we can use it to begin\nour synchronization here.\n\n14\n00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.110\nSo in a previous episode we've kinda\nwalked you through part of it.\n\n15\n00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.510\nWe didn't really get\nthrough the entirety of it.\n\n16\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.130\nBut now we wanna actually show you some of\nthe rest of the process that we need to do\n\n17\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.510\nto make sure that we get everything ready.\n\n18\n00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.640\nSo, let's go ahead and do that and\nthen to a point we're gonna also\n\n19\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.820\nkind of backtrack just a little bit before\nI go on and finish everything here.\n\n20\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.230\nNow, one of things that we need to\ntalk about is what happens then?\n\n21\n00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.720\nWith Active Directory and\nyour Active Directory.\n\n22\n00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.330\nAs well as your Office 365 accounts.\n\n23\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.270\nLet's say that for example,\nyou have a pilot setup, right?\n\n24\n00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.960\nAnd once your pilot is actually setup,\nyou might have actually had someone like\n\n25\n00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.030\nDaniel, actually not only part of your\nactive directory, on your premises.\n\n26\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.410\nBut as well as now a user\naccount up in Office 365.\n\n27\n00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.890\nWell, how do those two synchronize and\nwhat needs to happen there for\n\n28\n00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.060\nan that to work?\n\n29\n00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.740\nAnd the way that we make that something\nlike that work is what we call,\n\n30\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.310\nof course, technically,\n\n31\n00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.830\nthey call it a soft match inside of\nActive Directory is what we call here.\n\n32\n00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.760\nThe way that we implement\nthat is right here inside\n\n33\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.340\nof the Azure Active Directory\nconnect tool.\n\n34\n00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.440\nSo instead of me having to go and\nsay, all right,\n\n35\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.020\nI need to make sure that this account\nmatches up to the one up on Office 365.\n\n36\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.530\nI can tell the connect tool that as it\nlooks through to go ahead to look for\n\n37\n00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.340\ncertain things to end up a match.\n\n38\n00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.900\nOkay?\n\n39\n00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.720\nNow right here it actually says users\nthat are represented once across\n\n40\n00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.330\nall directories, how is it that\nthey're actually going to match up, or\n\n41\n00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.310\nif I wanted to I could do it\na little bit based loosely here.\n\n42\n00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.921\nSuch as things like the male attribute,\nnot male as in me.\n\n43\n00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:26.156\n>> M-A-L-E.\n\n44\n00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:27.391\n>> M-A-I-L.\n\n45\n00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:30.710\nSo I knew that I just said that and\npointed that out,\n\n46\n00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.580\npeople would be like, there's\na masculinity to the attributes here?\n\n47\n00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.330\nNo, but this is all about,\nof course, your email.\n\n48\n00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.815\nSpecific SAM account names,\nnickname attributes, you can do that.\n\n49\n00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:43.400\nThat's what you would call a soft match\n\n50\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.830\nif you were to do something\nlike that instead.\n\n51\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.370\nSoft matches do tend to work\nespecially when you do have situations\n\n52\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.600\njust like I described here.\n\n53\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.970\nMaybe you are pilot users and then you\nare trying to sync those things up.\n\n54\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.392\nInstead of trying to match those things\nup why not base it on this then.\n\n55\n00:03:00.392 --> 00:03:03.249\nI'm not going to worry about that we\nare going to do this one object ID.\n\n56\n00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.204\nWell, remember that inside of your\nActive Directory, your own account,\n\n57\n00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:12.230\nDaniel's account has its own special SID,\nright, his own security identifier.\n\n58\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.350\nWell, remember that when I set up a pilot,\n\n59\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.630\nI just created Daniel's name in Active\nDirectory, or in Office 365 up there.\n\n60\n00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.040\nWhat are the chances, then,\nthat the object IDs are going to match up?\n\n61\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.840\nNot not going to match up at all.\n\n62\n00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.470\nSo, it's here, instead, that if you do\nbelieve that this is gonna be problematic,\n\n63\n00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.990\nokay, this is where instead you might\nselect that option and say, hey,\n\n64\n00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.270\nhere's what I want it to match on.\n\n65\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.180\nAnd a lot of times we might do it based on\n\n66\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.690\nthe email address more than anything else,\nright?\n\n67\n00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.360\nSomething like that.\n\n68\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.930\nAnd one of those attributes and\nthe way that it's actually set up here.\n\n69\n00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.800\nAnd so you can say that mail attribute\n\n70\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.050\nfrom there you would then have to select\nwhat of those attribute is gonna be and\n\n71\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.030\nI can't remember which one is\nexactly it is going to be here.\n\n72\n00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.040\nBut you might actually come down\nhere where it does exchange and\n\n73\n00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.050\nyou look through and you might see like\nexchange mailbox or something like that.\n\n74\n00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.560\nAnd then you might be able to match that\nall up, but I don't actually see exactly,\n\n75\n00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.510\nlike this,\nthe mailbox it may be something like that.\n\n76\n00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.160\nOr you know whatever it might be here,\n\n77\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.650\nthe user name, the account name,\nyou know whatever it might be.\n\n78\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.840\nYou can do that and tell it,\n\n79\n00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.580\nI want it matched based on\nthose types of attributes.\n\n80\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.590\nAnd that will allow it to go okay,\nit doesn't matter if the object ID up in\n\n81\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.980\nOffice 365 matches what the,\nthe CID on my active directory premise.\n\n82\n00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.430\nWe can do a soft match and\nlink that up instead here.\n\n83\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.060\nOkay?\n\n84\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.280\nBut, in the, as long as you're\nwilling to do that, and you can.\n\n85\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.830\nI'm just not taking time to do it right\nnow, cause I'd probably take 30 minutes\n\n86\n00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.550\ntrying to search through and figure\nout exactly which one it needs to be.\n\n87\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.140\nBut once you do that it now allows for\nDaniel's email, his Active Directory\n\n88\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.800\nemail account to essentially find\nthis link up in Office 365 and\n\n89\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.400\nsynchronize between the two without us\nhaving to delete the Office 365 account.\n\n90\n00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.540\nAnd then go okay as long as\nthe syncs over we're fine.\n\n91\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.310\nBut I'll you the truth, to me, that would\nprobably be easier at this point in time.\n\n92\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.640\nThe reason why is cuz I don't know\nexactly which attribute it would be.\n\n93\n00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.050\nSo it does take a little bit of research,\nso\n\n94\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.490\nI'm trying not to pigeon hole into just\nthe mailbox cuz it's easier than saying,\n\n95\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.790\noh, we have to do it on mailbox but\nsometimes you don't.\n\n96\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.800\nYou can do it on any one\nof those attributes.\n\n97\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.000\nAs long as you go I know that this\nis how I want to match it up.\n\n98\n00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.960\nSo just kind of realize that you can\nset up that soft match if you wanted\n\n99\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.360\nto to be able to do that.\n\n100\n00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.920\nNow once we select that I'm just going to\nuse the user principle name instead which\n\n101\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.200\nis going to be fairly unique anyways,\nand click next here.\n\n102\n00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.470\nNow it's going to ask about\nthe filtering that we're going to do.\n\n103\n00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.370\nSynchronize all users and devices, or\nI can base it off of the selected here.\n\n104\n00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.550\nNow, when I do this,\n\n105\n00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.980\nthis is actually assuming that\nI've already done some filtering.\n\n106\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.880\nNow if I go ahead and do this, and\nI've done my Active Directory filtering,\n\n107\n00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.260\nit's only gonna synchronize\nwhat I filtered out originally.\n\n108\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.690\nSo if you don't remember that,\nor you can go back and\n\n109\n00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.770\nsee the episodes where what we did is that\nwe used, oops let me try and pull that\n\n110\n00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.090\nup again a little bit slower here, the\nactive directory synchronization service\n\n111\n00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.190\nmanager where we were able to go in there\nand take the OUs and filter those out.\n\n112\n00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.340\nSo in other words if I already have\na filter, I can feel pretty confident then\n\n113\n00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.480\ninstead and tell it to go ahead and\nsynchronize all the users and\n\n114\n00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.930\ndevices as well instead of having to sync,\nto try and figure it out here.\n\n115\n00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.850\nOkay?\n\n116\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.090\nClick next and it's here that\nyou have some optional features.\n\n117\n00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.980\nNow these are features that you\nreally do want to pay attention to.\n\n118\n00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.050\nNotice some of them have these green marks\nand they say preview And that means what?\n\n119\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.930\nThey're not exactly ready for prime time.\n\n120\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.470\nIn other words, it may work, but\n\n121\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.450\nif they don't work, expect that\nthey're not going to work here.\n\n122\n00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.430\nSo, they're previewing\nthis option later on,\n\n123\n00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.170\nof course as this AD\nconnect tool actually does.\n\n124\n00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.840\nYou know, become more and\nmore mature, they'll update it.\n\n125\n00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.100\nThese features will then become\nvery much a part of the standard.\n\n126\n00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.590\nThe exchange hybrid deployment, okay.\n\n127\n00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.430\nAzure AD app and attribute filtering.\n\n128\n00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.330\nNow I want to get down to\nattribute filtering inside for\n\n129\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.780\nthings like my SharePoint\nstuff if I needed to.\n\n130\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.720\nBut the password hash synchronization\nis probably a good one for us too.\n\n131\n00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.740\nAnd there's other things.\n\n132\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.080\nThe one that we wanna take a look\nat is this password writeback.\n\n133\n00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.130\nIf we do the synchronization,\n\n134\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.700\nremember what happens to your\nactive directory objects here okay.\n\n135\n00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.370\nThe active directory objects essentially\nthat go in to the Office 365 admin center,\n\n136\n00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.090\nthose really become read-only objects.\n\n137\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.320\nSo that means that\nthe changes that you and\n\n138\n00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.460\nI make to those objects,\nthey can't be done up there, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.490\nYou'll be able to click on one,\nyou'll be able to see, but\n\n140\n00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.030\nyou won't be able to change anything,\nright?\n\n141\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.160\nSo now, that means that all the changes,\nthen, when you do the synchronization,\n\n142\n00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.817\nthe source of authority, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:50.817 --> 00:07:56.008\nIn other words, the readable and\nwriteable copy of that Active Directory\n\n144\n00:07:56.008 --> 00:08:00.958\nis gonna be on-premise, and\nthat is a key for us to remember, right?\n\n145\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.264\nIf I need to make changes, then,\nto Daniel's account, to my account,\n\n146\n00:08:04.264 --> 00:08:07.032\nto Mike's account,\nto whoever's account I've created,\n\n147\n00:08:07.032 --> 00:08:09.718\nit's not gonna be changes that\nare gonna be made up there.\n\n148\n00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:13.520\nIt's gonna be changes that are gonna be\nmade on my active directory premises.\n\n149\n00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.570\nNow, one of the options I can have is this\npassword writeback instead, it'll say,\n\n150\n00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.960\nno, let's do this.\n\n151\n00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.290\nLet's let Daniel be the password manager,\n\n152\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.430\nand let's say that he's offsite,\nhe's not where I am.\n\n153\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.160\nAnd he doesn't wanna remote desktop then,\n\n154\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.770\nhe wants to be able to\nmanage it from here.\n\n155\n00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.860\nWe can actually leave that one feature\nwhere it does give him that ability to\n\n156\n00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.770\nchange it inside of\nthe Office 365 admin console.\n\n157\n00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.240\nSo any time you see the word writeback,\nthat's what it means.\n\n158\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.060\nBecause remember that you're not\ngonna be making changes up there,\n\n159\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.290\nokay, unless you give that\nfeature a writeback ability.\n\n160\n00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.620\nSay hey, from up here in\nOffice 365 writeback to what,\n\n161\n00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.850\nthat source of authority instead.\n\n162\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.390\nSo we could do that if we chose to.\n\n163\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.460\nBut those are options that you\ndefinitely want to actually explore\n\n164\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.750\ndepending on the context that you're in.\n\n165\n00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.790\nI'm not gonna worry about doing that\nright now cuz if I want control,\n\n166\n00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.990\nit's gonna be from my on\npremises active directory.\n\n167\n00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.620\nSo the first time that everything happens,\nright, the synchronization happens,\n\n168\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.270\nwhere now all of the objects that I\nwant synchronized up to Office 365,\n\n169\n00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.620\nit gets synchronized up there.\n\n170\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:23.950\nBut then from that point, okay, after that\ninitial synchronization, Office 365 hands\n\n171\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:30.090\noff the source authority back your\non premises active directory.\n\n172\n00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.600\nAnd that is also a key concept for\nthose of us who are getting ready for\n\n173\n00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.560\nthe exam to think about too.\n\n174\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.060\nIs that if we're gonna be making changes,\n\n175\n00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:42.030\nit has to be at the source of authority\nand not in the readable copy only.\n\n176\n00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.570\nSo changes that happen from the premise\nwill always go that way but\n\n177\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.710\nnot changes from Office\n365 will go the other way.\n\n178\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.710\nSo that's what we're actually dealing\nwith when we take a look at these\n\n179\n00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.180\noptional features right here, too.\n\n180\n00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.000\n>> And that's unless the writeback\nfeature is enabled where you just saw.\n\n181\n00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.130\nSo basically what you're saying Ronnie is,\nif I've enabled the writeback feature, I\n\n182\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:06.170\nam able to make changes, but it's actually\nmaking changes at the on premise and\n\n183\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.410\nthen that's, therefore,\nrewriting what's up in Office 365.\n\n184\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.173\n>> Yeah, you're gonna see\nthere's a roundabout thing.\n\n185\n00:10:13.173 --> 00:10:17.047\nSo even if you make changes in Office\n365 with the writeback feature,\n\n186\n00:10:17.047 --> 00:10:18.646\nit synchronizes over first.\n\n187\n00:10:18.646 --> 00:10:22.466\nAnd then the source authority says,\nyes, I agree with that change and\n\n188\n00:10:22.466 --> 00:10:23.450\nreports it back.\n\n189\n00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.130\nSo it is kind of\na roundabout way to do it.\n\n190\n00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.020\nBut active directory,\neven your current active directory and\n\n191\n00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.850\nAzure active directory requires\nonly a single source of authority.\n\n192\n00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.710\nAnd the way that we're doing this\nbecause of the way that single sign\n\n193\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:41.160\non may happen in your future,\nall federation services\n\n194\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.640\nreally only do the authentication through\nthe on premises active directory,\n\n195\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.520\neven if you're actually up there as using\nAzure in the background for everything.\n\n196\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.530\nYour on premises active directory is\ngonna become the source of authority\n\n197\n00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:53.600\nfor everything.\n\n198\n00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.480\nSo they really do, they want to\nmake that the single point and\n\n199\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.340\nnot make it super confusing.\n\n200\n00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.490\nSo this is all part of that feature in\ngetting everything set up, pretty hefty.\n\n201\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.460\n>> Yeah, it totally makes\nsense if you think about it.\n\n202\n00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.240\nIf we had multiple sources of authority,\nwhat would happen?\n\n203\n00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.220\nWell, let's say Ronnie and\n\n204\n00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.150\nI are two different sources of\nauthority on the same network.\n\n205\n00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.780\nIf Ronnie says the network\nname is Ronnie.com, and\n\n206\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.890\nI say it's Daniel.com,\nwell we're both the authority.\n\n207\n00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:21.520\nWho going to win?\n\n208\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.440\nWhat's going to write back and forth?\n\n209\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.600\nIt's gonna to be a land of confusion.\n\n210\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.630\nSo you have one single source of authority\nwho approves or does all the changes.\n\n211\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.390\nAnd that way all the others conform in\nlock step to that source of authority.\n\n212\n00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.980\nSo only one place, that way it\nkeeps confusion from happening.\n\n213\n00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.030\n>> And\nthat's pretty much the key behind this, so\n\n214\n00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.630\nit does sound a little bit convoluted.\n\n215\n00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.250\n>> It does.\n\n216\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.520\n>> But in the end, that's the reason why.\n\n217\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.481\nOkay, what exactly Daniel said\nthere is that we need to have one.\n\n218\n00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:50.728\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna click next here and\n\n219\n00:11:50.728 --> 00:11:53.770\nnotice it is beginning to\nconfigure these options.\n\n220\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.060\nHere's where you do need to slow down and\n\n221\n00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.770\nnotice a couple of things as\nwe're preparing for the exam and\n\n222\n00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.250\nas you're actually getting ready\nto do something like this.\n\n223\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.900\nNotice what is checked off by default\nhere, and I wish I could zoom in on this,\n\n224\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.770\nbut this is the best I can do here.\n\n225\n00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.640\nStart the synchronization process as\nsoon as the configuration completes.\n\n226\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.050\nRemember that if we do this,\nright, you click Install,\n\n227\n00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:20.030\nthis can take a few minutes and\nit can take up to hours and days even.\n\n228\n00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.620\nAnd it can be a little bit frustrating,\nright, as you continue to go back and\n\n229\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.020\nall you're seeing is a little bar\nkind of go across the screen here.\n\n230\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.880\nBecause it's actually gonna start that,\nand it's gonna synchronize,\n\n231\n00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.960\nit's gonna do all that stuff.\n\n232\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.710\nIf your active directory's small,\nit's not gonna take that much time.\n\n233\n00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:38.810\nIf it's big, it can take a long, long\ntime to actually get all this stuff done.\n\n234\n00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:39.870\nSo just realize that too.\n\n235\n00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.010\nThere's also what they call\na staging mode here too.\n\n236\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.810\nStaging mode doesn't automatically\nsynchronize right away, okay?\n\n237\n00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.370\nNow you may be wondering\nwhy you might do that.\n\n238\n00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.610\nIt might be that you are.\n\n239\n00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.400\nYou're saying hey,\n\n240\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.920\nI want to get to this point where I\ndon't synchronize everything, but\n\n241\n00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.390\nI want it to be ready to go.\n\n242\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.720\nBut, I want to examine it before I\nstart sending information out there.\n\n243\n00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.560\nYou can go into staging mode.\n\n244\n00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.850\nSo, what happens if we do this?\n\n245\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.130\nWe just leave it at the defaults.\n\n246\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.130\nOne, it's gonna create a task for\nus in our task scheduler.\n\n247\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.560\nAnd say, hey, this synchronization\nprocess is gonna happen.\n\n248\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.970\nAnd it will begin to happen immediately.\n\n249\n00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.870\nFrom that point on, it'll happen every\nthree hours, 24 hours a day into infinity,\n\n250\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.010\nokay, is what it will do as long\nas that machine is up and going.\n\n251\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.750\nAnd when we need to, okay.\n\n252\n00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.750\nIf we choose the staging\noption is going to disable,\n\n253\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.080\nokay, that task right then and\nthen it will wait for\n\n254\n00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.410\nyou to enable the task and\nbegin the synchronization process.\n\n255\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.380\nSo, you have those two options\nthat are available for\n\n256\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.510\nyou if you choose to do that, all right?\n\n257\n00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:43.325\nSo is from this point if I click\ninstall this is where it will go in and\n\n258\n00:13:43.325 --> 00:13:45.480\nwill start that synchronization process.\n\n259\n00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.780\nAnd it's going to take a few minutes\nof time as it's goes through.\n\n260\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.458\nIt's configuring and it's doing all\nthe stuff that it needs to do here.\n\n261\n00:13:51.458 --> 00:13:55.380\nNow the reason that I'm not so\nworried about it in the middle and\n\n262\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.116\nwe may take a little bit of time here is\nthat a couple of things are also going on\n\n263\n00:14:00.116 --> 00:14:02.134\nthat we need to understand too.\n\n264\n00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:06.259\nSo, if this is actually\nsomething that I'm waiting for\n\n265\n00:14:06.259 --> 00:14:11.349\nin the background, I need to make\nsure that Azure active directory or\n\n266\n00:14:11.349 --> 00:14:15.415\nthe Office 365 directory\nis also ready to go, too.\n\n267\n00:14:15.415 --> 00:14:21.952\nSo, what we have to do is we need to bring\nup, let me make sure I bring this up her.\n\n268\n00:14:21.952 --> 00:14:24.700\nWe need to bring up this, okay.\n\n269\n00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.660\nAnd why,\n\n270\n00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.110\nbecause there's to command that needs to\nbe run here if we're going to do this.\n\n271\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:37.470\nNow, the first thing I need to do of\ncourse is connect into msolservice.\n\n272\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.863\nAnd then make sure that I get\nconnected up to my Office 365.\n\n273\n00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:56.880\nLet me see if I paste my password in and\nget connected in there.\n\n274\n00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.100\nAnd then there is a utility\nthat we need to run.\n\n275\n00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.925\nOkay, so this is actually gonna be\n\n276\n00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:08.790\nSet-MsolDirSync and\nthis is gonna be enable.\n\n277\n00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.790\nAnd then we do another option which\nis gonna be enable Directory sync and\n\n278\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.212\nwe tell it that that's gonna be true.\n\n279\n00:15:19.212 --> 00:15:24.250\nAnd then we will do a -force here, okay.\n\n280\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.450\nNow I'm not actually\ndoing this right now and\n\n281\n00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.210\nthe reason why is I've already\ndone this in the background.\n\n282\n00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:34.200\nThat will then connect into Office 365 and\n\n283\n00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.780\ntell it to go ahead and\nenable the active directory sync.\n\n284\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:43.060\nNow, I wanted you to see this process\nbecause, what you see on the Office\n\n285\n00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:50.377\n365 side of things,\nLet me get back in here.\n\n286\n00:15:54.925 --> 00:16:00.220\nAnd I'll show you normally, if I\nactually type in the password correctly.\n\n287\n00:16:02.865 --> 00:16:03.411\nThere we go.\n\n288\n00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.650\nSo if you have not done that\nparticular command yet.\n\n289\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.838\nThen when you go into Office 365 and\nthe admin center.\n\n290\n00:16:17.098 --> 00:16:21.457\nAnd then, I select users in\nthe admin center and active users,\n\n291\n00:16:21.457 --> 00:16:25.075\nwhat you'll normally see is\na link up here that talks\n\n292\n00:16:25.075 --> 00:16:28.627\nabout Active Directory synchronization,\nokay?\n\n293\n00:16:28.627 --> 00:16:34.650\nNow if it's active, okay, you actually\nsee the word deactivate, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.618\nAnd then you click on manage and\neverything is good.\n\n295\n00:16:37.618 --> 00:16:43.080\nBut if it's not active what you actually\nsee is something like this right here.\n\n296\n00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.180\nSet up and manage active\ndirectories synchronization, and\n\n297\n00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.550\nit tells all the steps that you\nneed to make sure that you go and\n\n298\n00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.070\ndo to actually be able to sync up,\nand one of the last things\n\n299\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.000\nthat you normally have down here\nis a button that says activate.\n\n300\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:03.570\nSometimes, that button is there, okay,\nsometimes, this whole menu isn't there and\n\n301\n00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:08.362\nit depends on the level,in other words,the\nsubscription level that you have,\n\n302\n00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:12.125\nokay, so,the reason why that's\nimportant is this,okay,\n\n303\n00:17:12.125 --> 00:17:15.770\nif you get the little system wizard\nsystem that I've walked you through\n\n304\n00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.740\nit's going to ask you,\nhow many users do you have?\n\n305\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.441\nIt's going to ask you another couple of\nquestions and then it's going to tell you\n\n306\n00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:25.721\nwhether or not you should do\nActive Directory synchronization or not.\n\n307\n00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:30.084\nSo in other words it says, so like what I\nwould have picked 100 people or less it\n\n308\n00:17:30.084 --> 00:17:34.463\nwould have said, no, you don't want to\ndo Active Directory synchronization.\n\n309\n00:17:34.463 --> 00:17:36.840\nI would have to pick\nsomething like 5,000 or more.\n\n310\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.852\nThat is what they want you to do instead\nis they want you to walk through that but\n\n311\n00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.952\npart of the process and getting ready for\n\n312\n00:17:42.952 --> 00:17:45.816\nthe exam is understanding how\nto get this thing set up.\n\n313\n00:17:45.816 --> 00:17:49.149\nSo a lot of times this is what you\nwould normally see after you have\n\n314\n00:17:49.149 --> 00:17:50.860\nadded all that stuff.\n\n315\n00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.017\nThe, a little Menu system that\ngets you four, in other words,\n\n316\n00:17:54.017 --> 00:17:55.995\nyou get big gigantic numbers instead.\n\n317\n00:17:55.995 --> 00:17:57.340\nThen you go through and do this.\n\n318\n00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.965\nWe prepared for\nour Active Directory synchronization.\n\n319\n00:17:59.965 --> 00:18:01.870\nWe verified domains.\n\n320\n00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.810\nWe activated this and\nneed actually need to go through and\n\n321\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.961\ndo your Active Directory ID fix, right?\n\n322\n00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.020\nMake sure everything is ready to go.\n\n323\n00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.991\nWe installed the tool and\nnow we're actually connecting on them.\n\n324\n00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:14.765\nFrom that point that's where you\nwould run that Active Directory tool,\n\n325\n00:18:14.765 --> 00:18:17.080\nyou'd allow the synchronization to happen.\n\n326\n00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.520\nAnd when that ends up happening here,\nlet's see if it's done yet.\n\n327\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.059\nSo notice it's actually complete.\n\n328\n00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:26.410\nIt says now you can log in and\nverify that everything is actually ready.\n\n329\n00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.680\nSo, let me check it out here, okay.\n\n330\n00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.075\nNow if I go, let me see if I can bring\nup Internet Explorer at this point.\n\n331\n00:18:33.075 --> 00:18:34.572\nAnd we'll take a look here.\n\n332\n00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:39.092\nSo if I now go to my online and\nmy account, base,\n\n333\n00:18:39.092 --> 00:18:46.900\nnow remember I don't have a lot of users,\nI think I have like 15 or so, okay?\n\n334\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:51.821\nSo it's not a ton of users that I have,\nbut, if I go back into my\n\n335\n00:18:51.821 --> 00:18:56.747\nadmin center, and\nif everything is actually synced up here,\n\n336\n00:18:56.747 --> 00:19:00.086\nI can go to users, and active users here.\n\n337\n00:19:00.086 --> 00:19:01.753\nAnd then the moment there,\n\n338\n00:19:01.753 --> 00:19:05.680\nyou'll see all of these different\nusers that are there, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.960\nNow notice,\nhere's where the difference comes in.\n\n340\n00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.424\nNow let me show you my account, and it'll\nlook mailboxes are being created too.\n\n341\n00:19:13.424 --> 00:19:15.680\nLet me scroll.\n\n342\n00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.590\nSo here's the two that I\ncreated at the beginning.\n\n343\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.450\nRight?\nSo here is my Tenant account and\n\n344\n00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.000\nnotice where it says, In Cloud and\n\n345\n00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.750\nhere's the one I created outside\nthat says also, In Cloud.\n\n346\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.040\nBut notice just about everybody\nelse's account that I've created\n\n347\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.420\nIt actually says synced with\nActive Directory, okay.\n\n348\n00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.390\nSo, what is the difference if I select\nthis account that I created in the Cloud?\n\n349\n00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:45.620\nNotice I can go to delete, I can edit,\nnow let me see if I can edit.\n\n350\n00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.330\nYep.\nNotice I can go in here and\n\n351\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.350\nI can have additional details,\nI can type in job titles.\n\n352\n00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.980\nYou name it, I can do that.\n\n353\n00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.280\nIf I select, let's select Titus since\nhe's actually right here in the room.\n\n354\n00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.240\nNotice that if I try and\nclick on delete, not there.\n\n355\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:19:59.740\nOkay?\n\n356\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.340\nIt's grayed out.\n\n357\n00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.993\nIf I click edit here,\nand now look at this,\n\n358\n00:20:04.993 --> 00:20:08.658\nit looks like I can, I can't change this.\n\n359\n00:20:08.658 --> 00:20:10.330\nOops, it's actually gonna kick me out.\n\n360\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:11.318\nOut of there.\n\n361\n00:20:11.318 --> 00:20:13.420\nSo let me get back in.\n\n362\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.480\nSee I got click happy just on Titus' name.\n\n363\n00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.860\n>> You're Jiminy Clickit.\n\n364\n00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.618\n>> I tell you I am the man for that, so\nyou'll actually see that there will be\n\n365\n00:20:21.618 --> 00:20:24.743\nsome other accounts that\nmay be created there.\n\n366\n00:20:24.743 --> 00:20:29.166\nAnd the other thing that you also have to\ndeal with when this ends up happening,\n\n367\n00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:32.184\nwhen you're doing the synchronization,\nis that all\n\n368\n00:20:32.184 --> 00:20:36.898\nof your users will not be assigned their\nOffice 365 licenses yet either, okay.\n\n369\n00:20:36.898 --> 00:20:38.507\nSo notice up here at the top it says,\n\n370\n00:20:38.507 --> 00:20:41.310\nthis user is synchronized with\nyour local Active Directory.\n\n371\n00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:45.700\nSome details can only be edited\nthrough your local Active Directory.\n\n372\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.610\nOn the additional details here,\nI can add in his mobile phone Job title,\n\n373\n00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:56.240\nnothing, mobile phone, iCam,\nbut that's just about it.\n\n374\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.700\nSo now what does that mean?\n\n375\n00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.469\nThat means my source of authority,\nthen, even though it initially took\n\n376\n00:21:02.469 --> 00:21:07.488\nwhat was on my on premises active\ndirectory, it's now up in Office 365.\n\n377\n00:21:07.488 --> 00:21:11.053\nOffice 365 said hey,\nnow that we're synced up, a source of\n\n378\n00:21:11.053 --> 00:21:15.250\nauthority now is handed now back over\nto my on premises active directory.\n\n379\n00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.200\nSo let me get here,\nto my users and computers.\n\n380\n00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.990\nActive directory users and computers.\n\n381\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.830\nAnd it is here that you'll be\nmanaging those user accounts.\n\n382\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:37.560\nOkay, so, let's, we'll pick on Titus again\nunder production here, and there's Titus.\n\n383\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.468\nGo to properties.\n\n384\n00:21:40.468 --> 00:21:46.632\nSo let's say the one thing's that we,\nwhere is this?\n\n385\n00:21:46.632 --> 00:21:52.692\nI guess it's on General Tab,\nI could look for, what would it be?\n\n386\n00:21:52.692 --> 00:21:54.190\nOffice.\n\n387\n00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.092\nWhere's the title?\n\n388\n00:21:56.092 --> 00:21:58.071\nWhere can I find title?\n\n389\n00:21:58.071 --> 00:22:00.510\nWe'll do Office here.\n\n390\n00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.270\nAnd we'll say Studio2, okay?\n\n391\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.550\nSo I can actually apply that, do that, and\n\n392\n00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.060\nwhen the synchronization app is it can\ntake up to three hours for it to happen.\n\n393\n00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.560\nSo, don't expect it to happen right away.\n\n394\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.980\nSo what if I need something\nto happen right away?\n\n395\n00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.820\nWhat if I go, hey, I made that change.\n\n396\n00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.290\nI need something to happen.\n\n397\n00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:25.189\nWell, when you were running dir sync,\nright,\n\n398\n00:22:25.189 --> 00:22:30.257\nyou could go to the Azure Active Directory\nmodule right here,\n\n399\n00:22:30.257 --> 00:22:32.902\nmake sure you get connected in.\n\n400\n00:22:39.901 --> 00:22:43.141\nITProTV demo.\n\n401\n00:22:47.959 --> 00:22:49.004\nAnd click OK.\n\n402\n00:22:50.428 --> 00:22:55.679\nAnd at one point what you would do is you\n\n403\n00:22:55.679 --> 00:23:01.440\nwould import in a module called dirsync.\n\n404\n00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.380\nAll right,\nnow you'll actually notice something.\n\n405\n00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.570\nDirsync is no longer a valid module,\nso in Windows 2012 and\n\n406\n00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.700\neven if we tried to import in\nmodule [INAUDIBLE] it is not there.\n\n407\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:15.400\nOkay, so the other utility that you would\nhave actually ended up running here is one\n\n408\n00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.350\nthat would have been stash, stash,\nstart dash online coexistence sync.\n\n409\n00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.950\nNow it's a big long gigantic thing but\nguess what,\n\n410\n00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.810\nif you can't import in the module, your\nchances of running that second one that\n\n411\n00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.880\ntells is to force the active\ndirectory synchronization.\n\n412\n00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.460\n>> Pretty slim.\n\n413\n00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.680\n>> Probably slim, okay.\n\n414\n00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.100\nWe do have something\nthat we can run though.\n\n415\n00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.550\nBut we have to be able to find it on\nmy machine, so I'm simply gonna go and\n\n416\n00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:43.510\ndo a change directory, program files, and\n\n417\n00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:47.250\nthen it's gonna be\nMicrosoft Azure AD Sync.\n\n418\n00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.824\nSo if I go ahead and do my tab fill here,\n\n419\n00:23:49.824 --> 00:23:53.613\nmy key is that,\nI may get a little too click happy again.\n\n420\n00:23:53.613 --> 00:23:57.073\nSo there it is,\nthere's the Microsoft Azure AD sync.\n\n421\n00:23:57.073 --> 00:24:01.694\nAnd then from here there's\nanother sub folder called then.\n\n422\n00:24:01.694 --> 00:24:06.190\nAnd then if I do a dir for\ndirectory, I am looking for\n\n423\n00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:11.430\nthis one right here that says,\nDirectorySyncClientCmd.\n\n424\n00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.340\nOkay, that is the one that I actually\nwant to be able to run here.\n\n425\n00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.020\nNow when I run this,\nI'm telling it and I'm saying,\n\n426\n00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.330\nI'm forcing you to do this, okay.\n\n427\n00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.010\nGo ahead and do the sync.\n\n428\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:27.570\nThe problem that we have is\nthat if I sync this right now,\n\n429\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:32.350\nit's gonna run back through and\nsync everything, okay, all at one time.\n\n430\n00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.510\nIt's gonna try and sync everything.\n\n431\n00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:38.516\nSo there is something that we need\nto actually be able to do here,\n\n432\n00:24:38.516 --> 00:24:40.608\nwhich is to add an option in here.\n\n433\n00:24:40.608 --> 00:24:45.526\nSo if I now do the directory CMD here,\n\n434\n00:24:45.526 --> 00:24:51.405\nwhat I need is a option\nhere that says delta.\n\n435\n00:24:51.405 --> 00:24:56.599\nOkay, and then the itprotvdemo.com,\n\n436\n00:24:56.599 --> 00:24:59.670\nor itprotvdemo.com.\n\n437\n00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:04.820\nSo when I put the delta option there\nI'm signifying, well, changes, right?\n\n438\n00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.100\nSo what I'm saying is go ahead and\ndo a for sync, but on what?\n\n439\n00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.450\nOn what has changed since the sync.\n\n440\n00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:15.100\nOkay, so and\nthen limiting it to ITProTV and\n\n441\n00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.000\nfrom that point, if I get an error,\nit means I actually typed it in wrong.\n\n442\n00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:19.580\nBut there we go.\n\n443\n00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.140\nNotice it's initializing, and now it's\nactually importing in the information.\n\n444\n00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.560\nSo it should go through and it's taking a\nlook at everything that's essentially been\n\n445\n00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.640\ndifferent since the last time\nthe synchronization has happened.\n\n446\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.620\nSo you see we're synchronizing from all\nsources, also from the target and then,\n\n447\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.860\nit's finished up here, too.\n\n448\n00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.960\nNow, at this point, it actually\ndepends then if I were to try and\n\n449\n00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.970\ntake a look at that change, if I actually\nremember what the change is that I did\n\n450\n00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:48.830\nto Titus's account here, and whether or\nnot it actually shows up in Office 365.\n\n451\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.720\nSo I think I did it to Office,\nI think is what I did.\n\n452\n00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.710\nSo if I take a look at additional details,\nit might not even be,\n\n453\n00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:00.220\noh, it hasn't made its change yet\napparently.\n\n454\n00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.150\nSo, it's, oh wait.\n\n455\n00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.290\nAnyone know what I forgot?\n\n456\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:09.255\nI think I forgot to actually\ndo a refresh up here to,\n\n457\n00:26:09.255 --> 00:26:11.260\nlet' see if this actually\ndoes sync up here.\n\n458\n00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.090\nIf not it may just be again\na little bit of delay.\n\n459\n00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:17.680\nSo, even though I'm telling it to force\nit, it may still be a little bit of time\n\n460\n00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.396\nbefore it kicks in all\nthe way up here as well.\n\n461\n00:26:20.396 --> 00:26:26.990\nSo edit, let's see if I remember\nright I think I did change office,\n\n462\n00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:33.340\nadditional details,\nit's still not actually happening yet.\n\n463\n00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.950\nSo I'm gonna say we're gonna give it\na little bit of time and see what happens.\n\n464\n00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:41.090\nI believe it is gonna come in, it just may\nhave not of actually all synced up exactly\n\n465\n00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.920\nthe way that we wanted\nit to just about yet.\n\n466\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.974\nSo you will see changes like that end up\nhappening too as things are going on.\n\n467\n00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:52.510\nAnd I'm actually starting to see more and\nmore of these mailboxes happening because\n\n468\n00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.092\nwhat's happening, it's starting to say,\nhey look, I notice that there's a lot of\n\n469\n00:26:56.092 --> 00:26:58.765\naccounts in here, and\nRonny you haven't assigned anything.\n\n470\n00:26:58.765 --> 00:27:02.501\nSo now, what it's doing is going\nthrough and it's doing a lot more,\n\n471\n00:27:02.501 --> 00:27:04.450\nhealth mail box checks here.\n\n472\n00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.200\nAnd that is because active directory\nis now starting to send messages,\n\n473\n00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.650\nabout the health of the relationship of\nall the things that are going on, for\n\n474\n00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.400\nevery single account that we have.\n\n475\n00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.630\nSo we're starting to see some\nof that synchronization, and\n\n476\n00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.140\nstarting to do a lot more\nof that going on too.\n\n477\n00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.180\nSo it's just really here\nat the beginning right,\n\n478\n00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.210\nof getting that synchronization happening.\n\n479\n00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:26.790\nLike I said, wait another 10 or\n15 minutes, we may see everything kind\n\n480\n00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.440\nof populate in, and you just fill in\nunless I filled in the wrong field.\n\n481\n00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.902\nThat could also have happened too.\n\n482\n00:27:31.902 --> 00:27:36.817\nSo there's a lot of little things that we\nneed to keep track of if we're to do that,\n\n483\n00:27:36.817 --> 00:27:39.330\nand that's pretty much the key, right?\n\n484\n00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.686\nIs you go in and you make changes in your\non premises active directory, wait for\n\n485\n00:27:43.686 --> 00:27:48.174\nthose changes or try and force to change,\nand then give it several minutes, go to\n\n486\n00:27:48.174 --> 00:27:53.170\nOffice 365, verify that those changes\nhave taken place, and there you have it.\n\n487\n00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.510\nYou gotta go back and\nsee what then synchronized, and\n\n488\n00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.310\nthat's just part of the troubleshooting\nsteps that we all have to be able to do.\n\n489\n00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.020\n>> Yeah just part of being in the biz,\nbeing sysadmin.\n\n490\n00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.060\nPaste it across your chest.\n\n491\n00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.025\nThese are the kinds of things that\nyou're gonna have to go through.\n\n492\n00:28:05.025 --> 00:28:06.690\nCuz like Ronnie said it's easy for\nme to go,\n\n493\n00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.540\noh I actually put that in the wrong field,\nlet me go back and do that.\n\n494\n00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.750\nAnd you could have swore,\n\n495\n00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.800\nyou would have bet your life on the farm,\nthat you put the right thing in.\n\n496\n00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.250\nYou go back, oh yeah I put it in the wrong\nfield, and now it's starting to show,\n\n497\n00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.890\nwe have to resync it again.\n\n498\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.330\nBut, the cool thing is,\n\n499\n00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:24.980\nis that if we do need that on demand sync,\nCLI comes around right to our rescue.\n\n500\n00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.310\nWe do have a tool that\nwill allow us to do that.\n\n501\n00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.320\nAnd those are the kind of things that\nyou're probably gonna get embedded into\n\n502\n00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.850\nyour brain because you're gonna do often\nenough that you're gonna remember it.\n\n503\n00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.040\nAll right,\nit's gonna become a part of what you do\n\n504\n00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.570\nwhen you need to do an on demand sync.\n\n505\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.980\nOh, not a problem,\nI know the tool to go to.\n\n506\n00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.870\nAnd Ronnie, is there anything else\nthat we need to understand or\n\n507\n00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.280\nknow as far as this class goes?\n\n508\n00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.280\n>> No,\nright now at least getting it started and\n\n509\n00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.810\ngetting the initial synchronization\nhappening is pretty much the key.\n\n510\n00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.410\nAnd then, of course, going back and\n\n511\n00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:56.640\nverifying the sync's happening, and if you\nhave strange things happening, like I do,\n\n512\n00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.020\nthis is where you go back and\ngo, what did I check here?\n\n513\n00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.990\nIf I'm starting to see accounts here that\nI didn't, it meant that one of my filters\n\n514\n00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.310\ndidn't work or I forgot to filter\nsomething I should've, and\n\n515\n00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.610\nthat goes back then to your on premises\nactive directory, resetting those filters,\n\n516\n00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.880\nand forcing the synchronization again.\n\n517\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.330\nSo it is a learning process in that sense,\n\n518\n00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:18.100\nwhere you do have to kind of try it out,\nbut at least you're here.\n\n519\n00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.771\nAnd now your 500 users in the active\ndirectory are now you know also\n\n520\n00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:22.473\nready to go.\n\n521\n00:29:22.473 --> 00:29:26.022\nAnd the other thing that I,\nthere was one other thing that I remember,\n\n522\n00:29:26.022 --> 00:29:27.707\nremember when I told you is that,\n\n523\n00:29:27.707 --> 00:29:31.979\nif you this type of synchronization with\nactive directory, your users are not gonna\n\n524\n00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:36.271\nautomatically be assigned one of those\nactivation's right for the Office 365.\n\n525\n00:29:36.271 --> 00:29:40.698\nThat means each one of these is that users\nthat you actually assigned, you need to go\n\n526\n00:29:40.698 --> 00:29:45.180\nback in and click on that licensing,\nand actually assign the proper license.\n\n527\n00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.740\nYou may find out that not every\nuser's gonna have that, but\n\n528\n00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.160\nif you are that means you paid for\nadditional licenses as well.\n\n529\n00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.940\n>> All right, awesome.\n\n530\n00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.540\nGreat stuff, Ronnie, and it's gonna be\na benefit to anybody out there that's even\n\n531\n00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.380\nthinking about deploying a Office 365\ninside of an Active Directory environment.\n\n532\n00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.240\nThat is the kind of stuff that\nyou absolutely must know.\n\n533\n00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.390\nOr, if you're studying for an exam, which\nyou probably are if you're watching this\n\n534\n00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.170\nepisode here, then that's gonna\nhelp you out there as well.\n\n535\n00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.310\nThank you so much Ronnie for\nexplaining this for us.\n\n536\n00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.739\nAnd thank you for watching.\n\n537\n00:30:11.739 --> 00:30:14.235\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n538\n00:30:14.235 --> 00:30:15.499\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n539\n00:30:15.499 --> 00:30:16.359\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n540\n00:30:16.359 --> 00:30:17.636\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n541\n00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:23.180\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Bryan.\n\n3\n00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.427\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ncontinuing through our series of\n\n4\n00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:24.170\nmanaging identities and\nthe requirements for Office 365.\n\n5\n00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.200\nAnd what we're gonna be looking at\ntoday is federated services and\n\n6\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.670\ntalk about the service that drives\nwhat's known as a single sign on.\n\n7\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.912\nSo today we're gonna be looking\nat planning a single sign on and\n\n8\n00:00:33.912 --> 00:00:36.372\nthe requirements behind it for Office 365.\n\n9\n00:00:36.372 --> 00:00:39.317\nAnd who better to show this\ntechnology to us but Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:39.317 --> 00:00:41.670\nRonnie Wong, how you doing Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.208\n>> I'm doing fine as we continue on\nour journey through managing and\n\n12\n00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:47.214\nreally working with Office 365.\n\n13\n00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:50.679\nTrying to get everything\nsituated the way that we need to.\n\n14\n00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.017\nAnd one of the things that we\nreally wanna get into of course,\n\n15\n00:00:54.017 --> 00:00:57.080\nis establishing that method for\nsingle sign on.\n\n16\n00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.467\nAnd we're gonna dive right into\nthat as soon as we can, but\n\n17\n00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:01.528\nwe do need to take a little\nbit of time of planning.\n\n18\n00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:04.034\nBut there's also something\nelse I want to do as well,\n\n19\n00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:07.550\nwhich is to show some of the things\nthat did take a little bit of time.\n\n20\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.290\nWhen we had something that we had to\ndo which was synchronizing directories.\n\n21\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.350\nSo we're gonna show you\nthat right away here, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.690\nSo in a previous episode,\nwhich was really not that long ago,\n\n23\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.190\nI say it was several hours ago\nhere in a previous episode,\n\n24\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.270\nwe had just begun the Active Directory\nsynchronization between our on-premises\n\n25\n00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.080\nActive Directory as well as the Office\n365 Azure Active Directory.\n\n26\n00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.600\nAnd we made that\nsynchronizing process happen.\n\n27\n00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.470\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n28\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.480\nSo, here it is,\nhere's all of my synced users.\n\n29\n00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.430\nAnd all the things that have actually gone\non that did end up happening, where it did\n\n30\n00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.680\npull in information from my on-premises\nActive Directory into Office 365.\n\n31\n00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.960\nNow that initial synchronization\nthat happens over the whatever,\n\n32\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.870\nthe importing and exporting, all that\nstuff that ends up happening here.\n\n33\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.250\nOnce that happens from the on premises,\nonto of course,\n\n34\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.130\nthe Office 365 background, and\nwhere it keeps all the users.\n\n35\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.355\nWell, remember we talked about the idea\nof source authority just briefly, and\n\n36\n00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:11.285\nas soon as that happens, what ends up\nhappening with the Office 365 is it says,\n\n37\n00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:15.985\nlook, the on-premises Active Directory\nwill now become that source of authority,\n\n38\n00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:20.145\nwhich means it's going to be our read and\nwrite copy of our Active Directory.\n\n39\n00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:24.285\nSo, if changes are being made, now that\nwe've got the synchronization going on,\n\n40\n00:02:24.285 --> 00:02:27.855\nthey'll have to be made on\nthe on-premises Active Directory.\n\n41\n00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:32.620\nAnd that particular part of that right\nallows us then all those changes, then,\n\n42\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.480\nthat we need to actually be able to do to\nuser accounts, that we need to be able to\n\n43\n00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.910\nadd, the changes will need to go on inside\nthe active directory there on premise.\n\n44\n00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.870\nAnd so, in a previous episode,\nI had made a change,\n\n45\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.960\nthen, to one of the accounts\nthat I have here.\n\n46\n00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.510\nAnd then I tried to force\nthe synchronization, and\n\n47\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.010\nin that episode I told you that\nyou just have to wait, and\n\n48\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.090\nafter awhile that the changes would show\nup, and that's exactly what happened.\n\n49\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.340\nAnd I wanted us to come back and see that,\nso that people didn't actually think, oh,\n\n50\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.960\nhe's just saying that\ncuz it's not working.\n\n51\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.980\nIt did end up working, and you can see it\nright here where it actually says Office\n\n52\n00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.460\nand I've added in Studio2 during our show,\nand you can see, I can't go in here and\n\n53\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.250\nactually delete it or\nchange anything here, but it took time.\n\n54\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.120\nThis can take up to about three hours\nbefore it actually changes here.\n\n55\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.700\nLet me get out of that purchase thing\nthat it actually wants us to do.\n\n56\n00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.110\nSo, it actually does take a bit of time\nbefore some of those changes go on.\n\n57\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.520\nNow, certain changes will\nhappen almost immediately.\n\n58\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.790\nLet's take for an example, Wes actually\nended up forgetting his password.\n\n59\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.770\nWell, if I reset his\npassword on the on premises,\n\n60\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.140\nhe should be able to log\ninto his Office 365.\n\n61\n00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.930\nAnd that change happens immediately.\n\n62\n00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.210\nBut there are certain\nattributes in the background,\n\n63\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.620\nin other words not so important\nattributes, that would change during\n\n64\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.640\nthe regularly scheduled synchronization,\nand that's what was happening here.\n\n65\n00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.090\nSo there are times where you will\nhave to wait for certain changes.\n\n66\n00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.470\n>> So if I understand it right,\nwhen we go from on premise, and\n\n67\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.320\nI've got that locally stored\ndatabase of identities\n\n68\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.100\ncertain things happen right away, it's\nobviously important to have a password to\n\n69\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.400\nbe able to access your resources,\nit is about availability, right?\n\n70\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.916\nBut some of the additional things\nthat are gonna be synchronized,\n\n71\n00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:16.450\nRonnie if I'm gonna implement this,\nI have to plan for\n\n72\n00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.220\nthe fact that it's just not\ngonna happen right away.\n\n73\n00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.140\n>> Yeah even though I\ntried to force it right.\n\n74\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.780\nThere are still certain ones which says\nlook the way that's gonna work today is\n\n75\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.760\nthis just gonna be forced on\na regular schedule instead or\n\n76\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.010\nelse it's not going to forced in\na way that we can actually run that.\n\n77\n00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.230\nBut I did wanna show you that it\ndoes take a little bit of time so\n\n78\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.840\ndon't get upset if it doesn't\nhappen automatically but\n\n79\n00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.880\ncertain things that should happen\nautomatically that you know or\n\n80\n00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.660\ninstantaneously or near instantaneous,\nI should say, should work.\n\n81\n00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.820\nBut remember that not\neverything's gonna work that way.\n\n82\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.470\nYou'll just have to wait for\nthe regularly scheduled synchronization.\n\n83\n00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.640\n>> Very good.\nOne of the terms that I think of when\n\n84\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.890\nI think of federated identities or\n\n85\n00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.040\nsingle sign on is this\nconcept of delegated users.\n\n86\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.230\nThat term delegated has always\ntripped me up a little bit.\n\n87\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.410\nRonnie, can you help me out with that?\n\n88\n00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.490\n>> Sure, there's a lot of different\nthings that end up going on.\n\n89\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.490\nSome of the things that we've been doing,\nand\n\n90\n00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.260\nI know that you're actually prepared for\nthis class, and you're still doing it,\n\n91\n00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.570\nand you might be learning it,\nbut there's other times, though,\n\n92\n00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.780\nwhat you need is you need to get Office\n365 ready to go as quickly as you can.\n\n93\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.500\nAnd that means that you may not even have\nthe time and the learning curve to be able\n\n94\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.190\nto finish this class before somebody\nsaying you need to push this out.\n\n95\n00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.710\nWell Office 365 in the past has\nactually had a little column here.\n\n96\n00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.510\nAnd let's go back to the admin center and\n\n97\n00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.700\nI wanna take a look here just\nbriefly where you say active users,\n\n98\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.330\ndeleted users and then directly underneath\nit used to say delegated users too.\n\n99\n00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.840\nNow what the heck is that about?\n\n100\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.020\nDelegated users allow me then,\nas someone that says,\n\n101\n00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.000\nlook I need to get this up and\nrunning, but I'll tell you the truth,\n\n102\n00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.030\nI don't have the patience to actually\nbe able to do this right now.\n\n103\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.250\nOr we really need to just get it up and\nrunning so we need an expert to come in.\n\n104\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.310\nWell if you need an expert to come in,\nessentially a contractor to come in and\n\n105\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.220\nset this up, well how do you do that?\n\n106\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.940\nDo you give them the username and\npassword to your tenant and\n\n107\n00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.120\nallow them to just manage the whole thing?\n\n108\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.570\nNo, what you would do instead is that\nyou would delegate authority to them and\n\n109\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.880\nthat actually is what\nthat used to be about.\n\n110\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.810\nSo when you do see this, a lot of times,\nif you take a look let's say for\n\n111\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.580\nexample, the exam objectives for\n\n112\n00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.840\nthe 70-346 exam you'll see where\nthey mentioned delegated users.\n\n113\n00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.810\nToday in the latest version of the console\nthat comes up in the admin center,\n\n114\n00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.430\nthey call it the Partner Relationships.\n\n115\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.380\nAnd that's actually fairly special because\nthat means whoever you're actually going\n\n116\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.750\nto call to do this, they need to be a part\nof that Microsoft Partner Network and\n\n117\n00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.590\nthen you can go out and search for the\nappropriate partner that has the skills\n\n118\n00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.090\nrepresented that you need to come and\nhelp you.\n\n119\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.930\nAnd when you do that,\nyou send an email invitation\n\n120\n00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.470\nto them and they are able to click on\nthat and then they get invited and\n\n121\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.380\nthen you give them whatever delegated\naccess you want to to build a set up.\n\n122\n00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.900\nThe directory synchronization,\nor the users, or single sign on,\n\n123\n00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.410\nwhatever else it might be, they take\nthe time to actually do all that for you.\n\n124\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.370\nAnd then, of course,\nyou pay them for it, but\n\n125\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.210\nthis is how you delegate\nthose responsibilities.\n\n126\n00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.450\nOnce that's over,\nif you only paid them to sign in, well,\n\n127\n00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.680\nthen you can go and manage your delegated\nusers or partner relationships.\n\n128\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.970\nIf I click on that link right now,\nyou'll see that there's nothing here and\n\n129\n00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.860\nI can't even add one in.\n\n130\n00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.430\nThey have to accept the email.\n\n131\n00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.870\nOnce I actually say,\nhey I want you to be this partner.\n\n132\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.910\nAnd then you know,\nwhatever the exchange is that happens and\n\n133\n00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.410\nthe agreement that happens.\n\n134\n00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.804\nOnce they actually get in here,\nit's at that point you at least can give\n\n135\n00:07:37.804 --> 00:07:41.331\nthem the management tools that they\nneed to help you set up Office 365.\n\n136\n00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:45.651\nSo there's always an alternative out there\nbesides just trying to figure it out on\n\n137\n00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:46.440\nyour own.\n\n138\n00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.722\n>> So the concept,\nwe think of delegation of administration,\n\n139\n00:07:48.722 --> 00:07:50.837\nis what I'm thinking of,\ninside of Active Directory.\n\n140\n00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:55.312\nNow this is a little bit different because\nin Active Directory let's say Ronnie's our\n\n141\n00:07:55.312 --> 00:07:58.988\ndomain admin and I happen to be\nan enterprise admin, if I want you to take\n\n142\n00:07:58.988 --> 00:08:01.879\ncare of let's say an organizational unit-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n143\n00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:03.400\n>> I can delegate that over to you.\n\n144\n00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.081\nNow you're controlling it so\nthis is close to that boat.\n\n145\n00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:10.726\nIf I'm understanding this right, this has\nto be an established Microsoft partner,\n\n146\n00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:12.280\nyou have to be established.\n\n147\n00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.090\nIt's not gonna be delegating\nit inside of my company.\n\n148\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.060\nIt's delegating it to a third party.\n\n149\n00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.110\n>> Right, we do have those same\nthings that Wess is talking about.\n\n150\n00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.250\nThe ability to delegate administration\ninside of Office 365, but\n\n151\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.160\nthis is really delegating administration\nof the entire tenant itself.\n\n152\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.050\nSo, it's not managing the business but\nit is them helping you, excuse me.\n\n153\n00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.570\nTo set it up,\nif you need the single sign on set up, and\n\n154\n00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.020\nyou need the federated services\nthat we'll be talking about.\n\n155\n00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.470\nIf you need that to do the active\ndirectory synchronization or\n\n156\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.840\nmanage, setup the management the way that\nyou want to then they can help you out.\n\n157\n00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.180\nThey can even help you roll this out\nto your business run through the entire\n\n158\n00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.930\nplanning and deployment if you want to.\n\n159\n00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.900\nThe pilot as well as the deployment but\n\n160\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.930\nremember in the end,\nwell when everything is done and finished,\n\n161\n00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.800\nright unless you've actually delegate\nthe responsibility for them to up keep it.\n\n162\n00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.310\nYou probably don't want them actually\nhaving access to it after that.\n\n163\n00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.070\nSo what you do instead is\nsimply then at that point\n\n164\n00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.160\nif they're here you remove them\nfrom the partner relationship.\n\n165\n00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.060\nAnd then you are done a and\nthat relationship is now finished.\n\n166\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.015\nSo there are delegated\nresponsibilities that you do get\n\n167\n00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:20.045\nespecially when setting something like\nthis up if you really don't have time.\n\n168\n00:09:20.045 --> 00:09:23.655\nSo that's the way that Microsoft\nwould really use that today.\n\n169\n00:09:23.655 --> 00:09:29.160\nJust remember that in order terms you\nmight see the term delegated users.\n\n170\n00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.600\nBut now today they call\nit partner relationships.\n\n171\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.360\nSo remember that when you take\na look at it on the exam as well.\n\n172\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.620\nGood things to remember as you prepare.\n\n173\n00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.980\n>> Now Ronnie, in what kind of, you know,\n\n174\n00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.175\nscenarios might we see something like\nthis as Office 365 for the sign-in setup?\n\n175\n00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:48.450\n>> Yeah, when we start talking about\nthe idea of being able to sign-in,\n\n176\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.160\nlet's go ahead and take a look\nthen at how we are also currently\n\n177\n00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.460\nable to get Office 365 and our networks\nworking together right now, okay?\n\n178\n00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.840\nSo when it comes down to it, and\n\n179\n00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.020\nif you've seen other episodes,\nwe've gone through this,\n\n180\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.620\nbut it's always a great place to review\nand to remember what has to happen here.\n\n181\n00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.210\nOkay.\n\n182\n00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:12.290\nSo, when we talk about the idea of\nthe scenarios that we have for signing in.\n\n183\n00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.380\n>> The initial scenario is simple.\n\n184\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.420\nYour company decides who's\ngoing to use Office 365.\n\n185\n00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.610\nSo what ends up happening?\n\n186\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.390\nWell you're already using your\n\n187\n00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:26.470\ndomain credentials to sign into\nyour network, so no big deal.\n\n188\n00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.540\nNow that you have Office 365 on board and\n\n189\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.070\nwhoever your pilot users are going to be\na lot of times that initial beginning,\n\n190\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.640\nright, is not that they're using their\ndomain credentials to sign in to\n\n191\n00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.390\nOffice 365, but essentially\nanother set of credentials, right?\n\n192\n00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.780\nSo a single identity or\n\n193\n00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.230\nsingle user having really two sets of\ncredentials that they have to remember.\n\n194\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.500\nOne, if they're signing\nin to network resources.\n\n195\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.620\nTwo, and\nthey're actually signing into Office 365.\n\n196\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.290\nSo essentially two different\nsets of credentials.\n\n197\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:53.910\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n198\n00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.530\nDoes it work?\nIt works perfectly fine.\n\n199\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.440\nThe only limitation and problem there,\n\n200\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.810\nright, is if people can't remember\ntheir username and passwords.\n\n201\n00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.420\nAnd then you ask them for it.\n\n202\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.170\nOh, you know,\nI just can't remember my username.\n\n203\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.690\nAre you changing it on\nOffice 365 admin portal?\n\n204\n00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.510\nOr are you going to Active Directory,\nusers and computers, and\n\n205\n00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.560\nresetting their password?\n\n206\n00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.800\nYou have to be very specific\nabout what you wanna do.\n\n207\n00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.520\nWorks, people might actually\nmaintain that, because why?\n\n208\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.510\nIt's easier for the administration side\nthat we do something like that, right.\n\n209\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.240\nI just say, Wes, you just gotta remember,\nwhen you're signing in here, make sure you\n\n210\n00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.610\nuse these credentials, when you're signing\nin over here, use these credentials.\n\n211\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.780\nNever do the two ever\nreally end up meeting.\n\n212\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.980\nThey really are two separate objects, or\n\n213\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.460\ntwo separate resources\nthat we have to manage.\n\n214\n00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.760\nAnd that will work.\n\n215\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.970\n>> So\njust because I use the same username, and\n\n216\n00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.000\nI set it up with the same password.\n\n217\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.060\nLike for instance,\nhere's what I'm thinking.\n\n218\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.350\nMy domain credentials,\nmy Microsoft account,\n\n219\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.510\nwhich is my personal account that\nI use for things like Xbox Live.\n\n220\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.830\nAnd then I think about my Office Office\n365 and Microsoft Intune subscription.\n\n221\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.840\nNow, I've set the same username.\n\n222\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:04.350\nI've set the same password, but that\ntechnically isn't a federated identity,\n\n223\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.110\nand that's where our concept of\nfederation services come in.\n\n224\n00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.960\nRonny, what is federation services about?\n\n225\n00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.510\n>> Yeah, when we start taking look here.\n\n226\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.550\nLet's go back to my diagram and\ntalk about what Wes is also saying and\n\n227\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.650\nthen we'll talk about this federation and\nwhat we need to understand here too, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.350\nSo when it begins right and\n\n229\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.440\nnow we've got things set up\nthe way that we want, you can't.\n\n230\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.890\nYou might be able to go in there and go\nlook, we're changing all of our users so\n\n231\n00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.490\nthat the username and password is the same\ninside on my own premises after directory\n\n232\n00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.530\nas it is on Office 365 but when you do so\n\n233\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.950\nremember that your actually still to\npresent two separate authentication.\n\n234\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.140\nIf I log in inside I have to do that.\n\n235\n00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.550\nIf I go to Office 365 I\nstill have to do that.\n\n236\n00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.770\nEven I'm using the same user name and\npassword.\n\n237\n00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.730\nThat is close to what we\ncall a single sign on.\n\n238\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.600\nBut technically is what\nwe call a same sign-on.\n\n239\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.230\nIt's just using the same credentials\nin two different locations.\n\n240\n00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.560\nAnd most of us do this.\n\n241\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:03.400\nMuch to the chagrin, of course,\nof most IT security professionals, right?\n\n242\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.940\nWe use the same username on one\nemail account that we do on another\n\n243\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.510\nemail account.\n\n244\n00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:12.180\nThe same username and password when\naccessing something we buy online rather\n\n245\n00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.320\nthan something we go and\nview somewhere else, why?\n\n246\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.010\nBecause that's just\nthe nature of who we are so\n\n247\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.140\nwe do same sign on almost naturally\nwithout thinking about it.\n\n248\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.020\nSo that is an indication, but the problem\nthat we still have is two separate\n\n249\n00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.020\nlocations, or two separate databases\nwhere we're entering in that stuff.\n\n250\n00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.060\n>> Okay, and that's one of the things\nI was just gonna ask, Ronnie.\n\n251\n00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.660\nSo what you're telling me here is that\neven though I have the same username,\n\n252\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.830\nI have the same password,\n>> Unfortunately, we've got in my case in\n\n253\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.192\nthe example I've got domain credentials,\nOffice 365 and the Microsoft account.\n\n254\n00:13:42.192 --> 00:13:44.920\nEssentially I have three\ndifferent databases managing\n\n255\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.140\nthree different identities, even though to\nme, it's the same password and username.\n\n256\n00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.190\n>> Yeah, it really does.\n\n257\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.500\nIt makes it easy for\nthe user at this point, but now you do,\n\n258\n00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.430\nyou have multiple places where\nall that information is stored.\n\n259\n00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.910\nWhich means there can be multiple places\nwhere corruption can also happen, and\n\n260\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.140\nwhich one of those did\nactually end up corrupting.\n\n261\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.180\nNow the way that we ensure that that\ndoesn't happen, is by doing what we talked\n\n262\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.270\nabout on a previous episode here, which\nis to synchronize our on premises active\n\n263\n00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:16.110\ndirectory, along with our office 365\nactive directed this in the background.\n\n264\n00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.430\nSo that's where we going to that active or\nAzure active directed synchronization.\n\n265\n00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.010\nLets take a look at once again here.\n\n266\n00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:26.060\nTo same one, so when synchronize\nthat what ends up happening\n\n267\n00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.690\nthat we take everything inside of\nour own premises active directory.\n\n268\n00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:35.110\nAnd we go ahead and we synchronize that\nto the Office 365 as your directory,\n\n269\n00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.710\nas your active directory right\nthere in the background.\n\n270\n00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:41.340\nOkay, so\nall that gets transferred over and so\n\n271\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.890\nthat what should happen right\nis that those identities that\n\n272\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.060\nactually are going to use both that\nthey're identical on both places.\n\n273\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.600\nOkay?\n\n274\n00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.640\nSo this means username and passwords,\nyes they're actually identical.\n\n275\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.650\nThey're not just that I set up\nthe same one in two different spots.\n\n276\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.760\nWe really did set it up on one spot and\nit transferred over to the other one here.\n\n277\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.970\nBut it still means that both sides still\nhave to have an account there, right?\n\n278\n00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.890\nSo it is setting it up up here, in the\nAzure active directory for Office 365 but\n\n279\n00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.250\nwe also have this over here, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.870\nSo, that is kind of the first\nstep that we can do.\n\n281\n00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.980\nBut remember, that still only gives\nus what we call the same sign-on.\n\n282\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.290\nWhen it comes down to what we're\nreally trying to do here, okay,\n\n283\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:28.560\nis that I want,\nwhereas I sign on in one place, it\n\n284\n00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:34.080\nautomatically gives me access to the other\none without me having to sign on again.\n\n285\n00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.850\nAnd that's what we call single sign on,\nokay?\n\n286\n00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.255\nNow we've been using single sign on inside\nof on premises networks for a long time.\n\n287\n00:15:41.255 --> 00:15:44.140\nOkay and\nthat actually gives us that same idea.\n\n288\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.129\nBut we don't tend to use it where I\ngo I'm gonna log into my network, but\n\n289\n00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:52.652\nthen I get access to a third party site,\nthat's actually not even connected to my\n\n290\n00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:56.805\ncompany and it's still trusted and\nstill does everything that I want to.\n\n291\n00:15:56.805 --> 00:16:01.669\nSo when we turn around and take a look\nat that, let me show you a diagram here,\n\n292\n00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:06.001\nthis is what essentially it will\nend up looking like in the context,\n\n293\n00:16:06.001 --> 00:16:08.139\nOf talking about Office365.\n\n294\n00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:13.552\nUsers will actually have\na single identity between both.\n\n295\n00:16:13.552 --> 00:16:16.248\nThe synchronization is going on.\n\n296\n00:16:16.248 --> 00:16:20.733\nWe still are actually having copies\nof them in both locations, but\n\n297\n00:16:20.733 --> 00:16:23.934\nnow when a user logs on\nwhat happens is they log on\n\n298\n00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:29.340\nusing what we call a federated server\nof some sort, a federated service.\n\n299\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.460\nNow what is that about?\n\n300\n00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.230\nWell that allows me to get access\nto things internally here but\n\n301\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.890\nthen when I go and\nbrowse my browser right or\n\n302\n00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:45.500\nto get logged into Office 365 it doesn't\nhave to actually ask me to login again.\n\n303\n00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.980\nWhat happens at that point is that\nthat server that we talked about\n\n304\n00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.860\nsends over a security token\nthat Office 365 trusts.\n\n305\n00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.280\nAnd then from that point it looks and\n\n306\n00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.850\nsays, here's the access that Wes or\nRonnie should have up there, and it should\n\n307\n00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:05.490\nautomatically give it to them without Wes\nor Ronnie having to sign in again, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:10.940\nSo that is pretty much the key,and this is\ntrue in a couple of different instances.\n\n309\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.870\nThis would work whether or not I'm\nactually on premise, in other words,\n\n310\n00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:20.600\ninside of the physical building where\nmy Active Directory that is actually\n\n311\n00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.470\nthere, or whether I'm actually\nout on the planet somewhere else.\n\n312\n00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.390\nI'm traveling for my company.\n\n313\n00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.460\nAnd I still need to use Office 365.\n\n314\n00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.730\nWell if I do that and\nI log in from wherever I am in the world,\n\n315\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:40.000\neven Office 365 automatically redirects\nme to say, hey you need to go and\n\n316\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.430\ncheck in to your server at\nyour business location.\n\n317\n00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.290\nAnd then that will actually\nverify your authentication, and\n\n318\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.110\nallow you to connect back into me.\n\n319\n00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.310\nSo it is a neat thing that we can do.\n\n320\n00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.340\n>> Now, you know,\nif I understand this right,\n\n321\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.610\nRonnie, what it seems like that we're\ntrying to do here is, we're trying to set\n\n322\n00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.460\nup a trust relationship between\n>> two different identity management\n\n323\n00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.300\ndatabases, so regardless of which\ndatabase you're looking at, and\n\n324\n00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.950\nI guess by association, you'd say the\nthird parties that own those databases,\n\n325\n00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.100\nseems like that's what we're doing.\n\n326\n00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.940\nWe're setting a trust relationship\nup between those two databases, so\n\n327\n00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.890\nif you tell me you own one database, and\nyou tell me I should trust such and such,\n\n328\n00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.420\nthen I let that person\nlog in to my database.\n\n329\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.930\nBecause we do have that trust\nbetween the two databases.\n\n330\n00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.900\n>> Yeah, let's go ahead and\ntake a look here at a diagram,\n\n331\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.430\nand get into it just a little bit.\n\n332\n00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.640\nSo remember that everything, regardless of\nwhere you are, whether you're outside of\n\n333\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.760\nthe organization or inside, it's gonna\nbe against this federation server here.\n\n334\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.540\nWhat we'll call\nthe Active Directory Federated Service.\n\n335\n00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.630\nNow when we do that,\nif I'm getting access,\n\n336\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.070\nof course, to resources internally.\n\n337\n00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.030\nNo big deal,\nI get access to other services.\n\n338\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.500\nBut now if I launch that web browser like\nI talk about, whether it's on my phone,\n\n339\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:58.130\non my laptop, whether it's actually on\nmy workstation, it'll automatically take\n\n340\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:04.470\nthat authentication right, and associate\nthis security token with it, an STS.\n\n341\n00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:09.050\nAnd then,\nbecause Office 365 trusts the certificate\n\n342\n00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.100\nthat we have between them,\nwell that means Office 365 I'll\n\n343\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.130\nget access to it immediately\nwithout having to sign in again.\n\n344\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.690\nAnd all of that is based around that\nFederation Services is what we're\n\n345\n00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:21.670\ntalking about.\n\n346\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:22.650\n>> Very good.\nSo\n\n347\n00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:27.400\none of the things that we have to know is,\nwhat is it that we need?\n\n348\n00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:32.590\nOr I should say, when do we need\nsomething like the Office 365 platform?\n\n349\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.360\n>> Yeah, whenever we actually\nwant to do this, right,\n\n350\n00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.490\nwhenever we actually realize\nthat that once again,\n\n351\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:44.600\nthat it's not enough that I just have them\nbe able to sign in in both locations.\n\n352\n00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.620\nI want to actually implement\nthe single sign on.\n\n353\n00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.950\nIt's at that point we need to make sure\nthat we understand at least the basics\n\n354\n00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.870\nhere of doing the federation\nservices in getting them all set up.\n\n355\n00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.610\nAnd the good thing is we are going to\nbe setting up the federation services\n\n356\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.460\nto make sure that we can change this and\ncan make it actually work here.\n\n357\n00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.630\nSo we're actually doing that\nticker part of a planning.\n\n358\n00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:12.790\nWe need to understand that there's\na little bit more complexity that goes on\n\n359\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:17.380\nbetween those two services and between\neverything else that needs to be set up.\n\n360\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.360\nBut the good thing is we've already\nset up the majority of it, right?\n\n361\n00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.890\nOnce we actually have the directory\nsynchronization going on between,\n\n362\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:30.700\nthe on premises, and of course the Office\n365 directory that they have up there.\n\n363\n00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.350\nOnce that's actually set up, the hard part\nthen is for us just to make sure that we\n\n364\n00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:39.510\nhave our federation servers set up the way\nthat we need to and there's a couple other\n\n365\n00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:44.020\nthings we need to make sure that we think\nabout and we also plan for it as well.\n\n366\n00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.770\nAnd that's what we need to\nactually begin to move into\n\n367\n00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:51.860\nis what are some of the considerations\nin that we have to do if single sign on\n\n368\n00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.450\nis gonna be what we choose to do.\n\n369\n00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.928\nNow you might be wondering why would\nwe ever choose single sign on?\n\n370\n00:20:56.928 --> 00:20:58.296\nIf.\n\n371\n00:20:58.296 --> 00:21:03.560\nWell if you are doing things like\nyour mail, right, your email,\n\n372\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.660\nand things like your SharePoint sites,\nyou wanna make sure that you don't have\n\n373\n00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.290\nto actually, every time I go and check my\nemail I have to enter in my user name and\n\n374\n00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.140\npassword, versus when\nI log into my domain.\n\n375\n00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.750\nWell, now you've got this very real reason\nfor you to set something like this up.\n\n376\n00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.960\nSame thing with SharePoint.\n\n377\n00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.730\nYou don't always want to have to do double\nauthentication, triple authentication,\n\n378\n00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.650\nwhatever it might be,\nto get access to those resources.\n\n379\n00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.890\nWhen you have to do something like that,\nconsidering single sign on\n\n380\n00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:36.040\neven though it's a little bit, I'll say,\ncomplex is probably the right word here.\n\n381\n00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.040\nIt takes patience, it takes time,\n\n382\n00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.230\nit takes a lot of testing even though\nthat can take a little bit of time.\n\n383\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.450\nGetting us set up, and once it's done\nthough it now becomes easier for\n\n384\n00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.780\nyour users and you don't ever\nhave to worry about it again.\n\n385\n00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.140\n>> I could see where having a same sign on\nwould really be difficult with something\n\n386\n00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.220\nlike SharePoint, you click the team site,\nyou log into your team site,\n\n387\n00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.620\nwell you got to log in, but\nthen I want to go to another site that\n\n388\n00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.970\nis lower than the team site maybe and\nnow I got to log in again.\n\n389\n00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.800\nWell, now Ronnie needs me to look\nat an IP spreadsheet, right.\n\n390\n00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.070\nYou know, network documentation.\n\n391\n00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:10.080\nI go to click on that file and well now\nI gotta log in three times and all I'm\n\n392\n00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.700\nabout two to three minutes or ten minutes\nbecause I can't enter a password anyways.\n\n393\n00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.390\nNow I've had to enter my credentials\nmultiple times just in that\n\n394\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:18.200\nsingle instance.\n\n395\n00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.830\nAnd I can see where productivity in\nthis case would really be wasted\n\n396\n00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.190\nacross what 10,000 users if\nyou cuz it scales up, right?\n\n397\n00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.750\nSoftware is a service, platform is\na service, infrastructure is a service,\n\n398\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:35.410\nit scales up in a large, large enterprise\nnetwork where that's just one person.\n\n399\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.180\nCan you imagine doing this through\n100 people, 300 people, 5,000 people?\n\n400\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.850\nYour productivity I can see where it would\nstart to drop on a same sign on like that.\n\n401\n00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.300\nAll right, Ronnie, so\nwhat do we have up next?\n\n402\n00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:45.810\n>> Okay.\n\n403\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.330\nWhat we're going to do is we're going to\ntalk about some of the things we must\n\n404\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.660\nmake sure that we consider when we\nmight actually do something like\n\n405\n00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.320\nthis idea of single sign on.\n\n406\n00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.830\nI just made a simple list for us so\nthat we could go through this and\n\n407\n00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.720\nunderstand some of the things\nthat have to be in place.\n\n408\n00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.670\nWhen we are considering this,\n\n409\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.720\nyou got to remember that\na couple things have to be done.\n\n410\n00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.080\nIf you're going to do this.\n\n411\n00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.640\nThe first one is probably already done for\nus, if we've set up a pilot of Office 365,\n\n412\n00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.265\nwe've gone ahead and we have our\npublicly registered namespace, mine is,\n\n413\n00:23:16.265 --> 00:23:21.270\nITprotvdemo.com and\nthis is the one that Office\n\n414\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.260\n365 recognizes And it knows that and\nit's actually out there on the Internet.\n\n415\n00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:30.150\nOkay, so that's actually a valid public\nnamespace that Office 365 identifies with.\n\n416\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.830\nIt's the one inside of my network as well.\n\n417\n00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:37.560\nSecondly, if we're gonna be using\nnow a federated server, okay,\n\n418\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:42.070\na federation server,\nwe also need to have a certificate\n\n419\n00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:46.530\navailable that's gonna be\npublicly identifiable as well.\n\n420\n00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.520\nNow, what the heck do I mean by that?\n\n421\n00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.330\nSo it's not one that I\ngenerate internally.\n\n422\n00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:51.530\nNow, can I do that?\n\n423\n00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.806\nYes, technically I can.\n\n424\n00:23:53.806 --> 00:23:56.205\nBut it means that everything\nhas to be done and\n\n425\n00:23:56.205 --> 00:23:59.123\nonly accessible from inside\nof my own network, okay?\n\n426\n00:23:59.123 --> 00:24:02.847\nBut if I wanna make sure that my users,\nregardless of where they are on\n\n427\n00:24:02.847 --> 00:24:06.651\nthe planet, I'm gonna need to set\nup that federation server, okay?\n\n428\n00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:11.241\nWhether it's gonna be a proxy server or\nnot, okay, I'm gonna need to set up\n\n429\n00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:14.828\na federation server and\nsay look, on the outside, right,\n\n430\n00:24:14.828 --> 00:24:19.638\nas we connect into Microsoft Online,\nif you're connecting from the outside,\n\n431\n00:24:19.638 --> 00:24:24.233\neven from the inside, that establishment\nor that trust relationship has to\n\n432\n00:24:24.233 --> 00:24:28.956\nbe there, and it has to be an identity\nthat Office 365 already does trust.\n\n433\n00:24:28.956 --> 00:24:30.113\nSo you need a valid and\n\n434\n00:24:30.113 --> 00:24:34.390\na public certificate to be able to do\nthis and put on that federation server.\n\n435\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.695\n>> I can see where the internal management\ncertificate manager on that would be just\n\n436\n00:24:37.695 --> 00:24:40.575\na bear and a nightmare, because\nremember if you're using certificates,\n\n437\n00:24:40.575 --> 00:24:42.595\nall your devices have to\ntrust the certificates.\n\n438\n00:24:42.595 --> 00:24:45.570\nSo if I'm using an internal public key\ninfrastructure, that means if I've got\n\n439\n00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:49.805\n1,000 devices that I want that certificate\nto be recognized, I have to install it,\n\n440\n00:24:49.805 --> 00:24:53.255\na root certificate that's gonna\nbe trusted by all those devices.\n\n441\n00:24:53.255 --> 00:24:56.615\nAnd now we go into the complexities of why\nare we using software as a service if we\n\n442\n00:24:56.615 --> 00:24:58.165\nhave to internally manage that?\n\n443\n00:24:58.165 --> 00:25:01.130\nSo I could say we're going to\nthe external certificate authority,\n\n444\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.600\ngetting a certificate that\nthe devices already trust,\n\n445\n00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.355\ndefinitely gonna reduce the administrative\ncomplexities behind setting this up.\n\n446\n00:25:08.355 --> 00:25:11.910\n>> Yeah, the other thing of course than is\nmaking sure that our federation service,\n\n447\n00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.310\nservers excuse me, are set up\nthe way that we need them to be.\n\n448\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:19.036\nNow, there's a couple of instances here,\nI wanna talk about topologies and\n\n449\n00:25:19.036 --> 00:25:20.484\ndependencies just briefly.\n\n450\n00:25:20.484 --> 00:25:23.908\nOkay, if you have a small\nactive directory,\n\n451\n00:25:23.908 --> 00:25:29.585\nnow small of course is relative, but\nlet's say a of couple hundred users or\n\n452\n00:25:29.585 --> 00:25:32.486\nless, maybe even 1,000 users.\n\n453\n00:25:32.486 --> 00:25:34.403\nI'm probably going a little\nbit above that, but\n\n454\n00:25:34.403 --> 00:25:36.290\nlet's just say a couple hundred users or\nless.\n\n455\n00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:40.301\nYou can actually go into\nWindows Server 2012, and go ahead and\n\n456\n00:25:40.301 --> 00:25:45.185\ninstall the active directory federation\nservices as a role in Server 2012.\n\n457\n00:25:45.185 --> 00:25:50.155\nNow, if you're actually in previous\neditions of Windows Server, like 2008,\n\n458\n00:25:50.155 --> 00:25:54.635\nyou may have to download the active\ndirectory federation services itself as\n\n459\n00:25:54.635 --> 00:25:57.810\na separate module, and\nthen add that in there.\n\n460\n00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:02.040\nThe recommendation is 2.0 or\nabove if you're gonna be doing that.\n\n461\n00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.130\nSo you do need to know that that's\nwhat might also have to happen.\n\n462\n00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.730\nNow, you might be wondering,\ndo I need a separate server?\n\n463\n00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.710\nThat again depends on the capacity\nin what you have available.\n\n464\n00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.160\nIf you have a really small one,\nlet's say under 50,\n\n465\n00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.828\nyou might actually be able\nto install the active\n\n466\n00:26:20.828 --> 00:26:24.150\ndirectory federation services in\nconjunction with another server.\n\n467\n00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.610\nIt doesn't have to be a dedicated\nindependent server by itself.\n\n468\n00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.450\nBut can you?\n\n469\n00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.740\nYes, you absolutely can install\nit by itself if you want to.\n\n470\n00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.350\nAnd the dependencies that it's\ntalking about here is that\n\n471\n00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:39.360\nnormally you also need to be running a web\nserver on that federation server too.\n\n472\n00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.938\nSo you need web servers, services running.\n\n473\n00:26:41.938 --> 00:26:45.607\nYou might need to install\nin dot net 3.5.1.\n\n474\n00:26:45.607 --> 00:26:47.324\nMake sure all of that\nis actually installed,\n\n475\n00:26:47.324 --> 00:26:49.150\nall those dependencies are there.\n\n476\n00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.390\nAnd remember it actually does\ndepend on what you're doing here.\n\n477\n00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:56.610\nThe other thing about the topology\nis that there are two different ways\n\n478\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.080\nthat you can set this up, okay?\n\n479\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.680\nIf you set up your federation server,\nokay,\n\n480\n00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:07.335\nas being a single stand alone federation\nserver will it work like a charm?\n\n481\n00:27:07.335 --> 00:27:08.320\nAbsolutely.\n\n482\n00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.280\nIt'll work just exactly\nthe way you want it to, okay?\n\n483\n00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.900\nYou can also set one up in what\nthey call a farm setup, okay?\n\n484\n00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.390\nAnd that means you might be\nadding in more into the future.\n\n485\n00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.320\nNow here's the difference between them,\ncan you have one in the farm?\n\n486\n00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:22.840\nYes.\n\n487\n00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.500\nCan you have one as a single stand alone?\n\n488\n00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.280\nYes.\n\n489\n00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.260\nSo why would I choose one over the other?\n\n490\n00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.460\nIn the future, you have a possibility\nthat you're gonna be adding in more and\n\n491\n00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:35.860\nmore federation services,\nmake sure you choose the farm and do that.\n\n492\n00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:40.460\nBecause this one factor,\nif you choose your federation server as\n\n493\n00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:45.990\na stand alone federation server,\nyou cannot implement a farm later.\n\n494\n00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:50.900\nOkay, if you choose the farm and you only\nhave one, works perfectly fine as well.\n\n495\n00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:51.980\nBut it gives you,\n\n496\n00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:57.210\nlater on the capacity as your network\ngrows that you don't have to actually now\n\n497\n00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:02.210\ntear the infrastructure down, and then\nrebuild the entire federation server farm.\n\n498\n00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.866\nBut you can actually now add in\nan additional one and continue to build.\n\n499\n00:28:06.866 --> 00:28:11.100\nSo usually the best practices, even if\nyou only have one as a stand alone,\n\n500\n00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.926\ndon't set it up as a stand alone,\nand it's just a simple check box.\n\n501\n00:28:13.926 --> 00:28:17.030\nAnd we'll see,\nlet's kinda talk about the process,\n\n502\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:20.420\nwe won't see the entire process\nas we go all the way through.\n\n503\n00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.848\nBut that's what you want to make sure of\nwhen you talk about the topologies and\n\n504\n00:28:23.848 --> 00:28:24.596\ndependencies.\n\n505\n00:28:24.596 --> 00:28:30.039\nSo web server and that also goes along\nwith the certificate as well, okay?\n\n506\n00:28:30.039 --> 00:28:32.150\nSo remember you're gonna\nget a public certificate.\n\n507\n00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.390\nYou're gonna have the web server and\n\n508\n00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:38.050\nthat also needs to be installed in\nthe web server, SSL has to be turned on.\n\n509\n00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.980\nYou name it, there's a lot of\nsetup here that has to be done\n\n510\n00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.300\nwhen you talk about\nthe planning stages of this.\n\n511\n00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.000\nSo you gotta get all this in\nyour mind as you're doing it.\n\n512\n00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.080\nAnd even write it down on paper,\n\n513\n00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.750\nbecause missing these steps can\ncause incredible frustration.\n\n514\n00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:56.360\nI know, let me tell you I really do\nknow that, so just realize, okay?\n\n515\n00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.910\nNow there's another one here that\nwe wanna briefly talk about,\n\n516\n00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.290\nwhich is of course the proxy.\n\n517\n00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:06.240\nNow, it says active directory\nfederation proxy topologies too.\n\n518\n00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.670\nSo when do you use a proxy,\nwhen do you not use a proxy, okay?\n\n519\n00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:13.520\nWell, you don't have to use a proxy, but\nthis is when you would choose to use one.\n\n520\n00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.530\nIf you know that you're gonna be having\nusers that are actually going to be\n\n521\n00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:21.770\ntrying to do the authentication inside and\noutside of your network, okay?\n\n522\n00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.190\nThen normally, in terms of your\nfederation services, topology,\n\n523\n00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.540\nyou wanna include in a proxy.\n\n524\n00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.020\nSo if you do have users that, they're not\ngonna be always from the inside of your\n\n525\n00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:37.710\nnetwork, but inside and outside then\nsetting up a proxy is the way to go, okay?\n\n526\n00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.640\nSo the proxy allows then to actually say,\n\n527\n00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.130\nhey, they're coming internally for\nresources on premises\n\n528\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:47.270\nthat it knows how to actually ensure that\nwe give the right credentials to that.\n\n529\n00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:51.630\nIf now the proxy server says yes,\nI'm only going to active directory 365,\n\n530\n00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.120\nit authenticates against\nthe federation server.\n\n531\n00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.370\nAnd then the federation server says, all\nright, proxy server, go ahead and issue\n\n532\n00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:03.910\nthat security token, so that this user can\nget access to Office 365 as well, okay?\n\n533\n00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.810\nSo that's normally why you would\ntend to use a proxy if you're\n\n534\n00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.510\ndoing something like that as well.\n\n535\n00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.650\nNetwork requirements is another thing\nwe need to be concerned about too.\n\n536\n00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.460\nRemember that Office 365,\n\n537\n00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.728\nthe synchronization, all of this can\nactually be intensive on your bandwidth.\n\n538\n00:30:18.728 --> 00:30:22.920\nOkay, and it really can, it depends\non how big everything actually is.\n\n539\n00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:27.290\nBut you do need to be considerate of the\nbandwidth, the properties that you have.\n\n540\n00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:32.790\nAnd you also may want to consider\nthen setting up an actual\n\n541\n00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.860\nVPN connection also,\nto the Azure active directory.\n\n542\n00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:42.540\nSo normally, when you pay for that Office\n365, they'll also give you access to that\n\n543\n00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.710\nwhere you can set this up as a dedicated,\nwith a VPN connection across instead, so\n\n544\n00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:51.650\nthat you can actually have all your stuff\nsent, of course, encrypted there, too.\n\n545\n00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.190\nAre you gonna be using\nmulti-factor authentication?\n\n546\n00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.750\nRemember that you need to consider\nthis too, if you are going to do that.\n\n547\n00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.480\nAnd then lastly,\n\n548\n00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.760\nabout the idea of what can be sent\nacross in that security token, okay?\n\n549\n00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:09.070\nSo, when we talk about the claims rules\nhere, it means you can customize, okay?\n\n550\n00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.240\nYou can actually say, I wanna allow Wes\nto do this on Tuesday and Wednesday, but\n\n551\n00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.460\nnot on Thursday and\nFriday if you wanted to.\n\n552\n00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.540\nIt just depends on what\nyou want to set up, and\n\n553\n00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:22.330\nyou have the ability to control\naccess filtering in that way, and\n\n554\n00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.650\nyou can use federation services in\nthe background to help you do that too.\n\n555\n00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:30.220\nSo just kind of realize that there's\na lot of considerations and a lot of\n\n556\n00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.250\nplanning that has to be done before you\njust go, oh I'm just going to do this.\n\n557\n00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.510\nJust doing that can cause headaches, and\n\n558\n00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:40.060\nI guarantee you that the way\nthat I know that is it's just,\n\n559\n00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.930\noh we'll just throw it in there,\nwe'll make it work, we'll make it work.\n\n560\n00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.730\nAnd don't get me wrong, will it work?\n\n561\n00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.420\nYes, but will you have a lot\nmore headaches when you don't\n\n562\n00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.590\nconsider this stuff?\n\n563\n00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:52.640\nYeah, you'll be backtracking quite\na bit in just trying to get it\n\n564\n00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.000\nset up to make that initial\nfederation service happen.\n\n565\n00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.860\n>> Now, one of the questions\nthat I wanted to mention, and\n\n566\n00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.280\nmaybe our viewers out there\nmight have that same question,\n\n567\n00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.630\ngoing back to the ADFS,\nActive Directory Federated Service Proxy.\n\n568\n00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.160\nRonnie, would this be something,\nlike maybe for\n\n569\n00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.870\nsecurity purposes,\nthat we'd put in a demilitarized zone,\n\n570\n00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.930\nlike a DMZ, like a perimeter network,\nas Microsoft calls it as well?\n\n571\n00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.030\n>> You definitely would, right?\n\n572\n00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.180\nSo this is the one thing that\nyou don't tend to have to\n\n573\n00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.730\nhave inside of your networks and normally,\n\n574\n00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:22.250\nbecause it is, it's about your users\nbeing somewhere else on the world.\n\n575\n00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:23.770\nYou don't want them\nalways having to go and\n\n576\n00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.450\nauthenticate directly in your proxy\nserver, which is gonna be inside.\n\n577\n00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.536\nYou may not even join this\ncomputer to your domain.\n\n578\n00:32:30.536 --> 00:32:33.191\nOkay, so\nyou may actually take that proxy server,\n\n579\n00:32:33.191 --> 00:32:37.083\nthat federated proxy server instead and\nactually have it as a stand alone,\n\n580\n00:32:37.083 --> 00:32:40.852\nbut then it just sends the authentication\ninto the domains as well.\n\n581\n00:32:40.852 --> 00:32:43.575\n>> Very good, the other question I\nwas thinking about is talking about\n\n582\n00:32:43.575 --> 00:32:44.731\nthe network requirements.\n\n583\n00:32:44.731 --> 00:32:48.190\nIf maybe I'm monitoring my bandwidth well,\nyou have to monitor your bandwidth, and\n\n584\n00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:51.615\nRonnie, would this be something like, and\nI'm just gonna throw a number out here.\n\n585\n00:32:51.615 --> 00:32:54.900\nMaybe if you're at 75% already before\nyou implement something like this,\n\n586\n00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.143\nof your bandwidth capacity,\n\n587\n00:32:56.143 --> 00:32:58.965\nmaybe we gotta consider at,\ncuz that's where we're at, right?\n\n588\n00:32:58.965 --> 00:33:00.915\nPlanning, like things\nlike WAN accelerators,\n\n589\n00:33:00.915 --> 00:33:05.585\nload balancers, maybe have to scale up\nthe internal infrastructure to support it,\n\n590\n00:33:05.585 --> 00:33:07.755\nif you're already at close\nto your bandwidth count.\n\n591\n00:33:07.755 --> 00:33:10.675\n>> You definitely will need to\nconsider stuff like that too.\n\n592\n00:33:10.675 --> 00:33:14.404\nSo it really is about the load that we're\nactually sending across all ready, in\n\n593\n00:33:14.404 --> 00:33:18.037\nterms of synchronization, and everything\nelse that has to go across there.\n\n594\n00:33:18.037 --> 00:33:21.985\nBut remember that it's the performance\nthat you're worried about more than\n\n595\n00:33:21.985 --> 00:33:25.750\nanything, back into your network,\nespecially if all your network users\n\n596\n00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:29.286\nare in one location, and\nthey're all connecting to Office 365.\n\n597\n00:33:29.286 --> 00:33:32.982\nIt can be a pretty intensive bit of\nload there if they're also doing\n\n598\n00:33:32.982 --> 00:33:37.273\nthe collaboration, and they're storing\nstuff on their OneDrive account,\n\n599\n00:33:37.273 --> 00:33:38.360\nyou name it.\n\n600\n00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.730\nYou can flood that pretty heavily,\nso you do need to consider this,\n\n601\n00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.800\nespecially if you're gonna be doing\nthis type of authentication and\n\n602\n00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.090\nsending the tokens back and\nforth like crazy.\n\n603\n00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.270\n>> Great information, Ronnie.\n\n604\n00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:52.622\nThank you for all that information on\nOffice 365, and planning for your SSO, but\n\n605\n00:33:52.622 --> 00:33:55.499\nit looks like we have come to\nthe end of another episode,\n\n606\n00:33:55.499 --> 00:33:58.275\nso we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n607\n00:33:58.275 --> 00:33:59.590\nI've been your host, Wes Brian.\n\n608\n00:33:59.590 -->

They begin by creating an ADFS service account as well as install the Federation Services server role and supporting services like IIS and the .NET framework. They also show you how to install the necessary SSL certificate into IIS. Next they configure ADFS for Single Sign-On. Finally, they finish the setup by configuring Windows Azure Active Directory(WAAD) to connect to the Office365 environment.",

I'm\n\n3\n00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:20.287\nyour host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:24.160\nour Microsoft Office 365 Identities and\nRequirements series.\n\n5\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.830\nI know you guys have been\nhaving a good time watching it.\n\n6\n00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.910\nI have had a great time.\n\n7\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.110\nAnd joining us back for that great time,\nwell it's none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.530\nRonnie welcome back to the show sir.\n\n9\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.060\n>> Well thank you.\n\n10\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.760\nIt's great to be back here as we\ncontinue on taking a look at Office 365.\n\n11\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.132\nAnd, we've already started to take a look\nat what we call single sign on, right?\n\n12\n00:00:42.132 --> 00:00:46.653\nThe ability to ensure that we only have\none set of credentials regardless of where\n\n13\n00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:50.589\nwe actually are going to get access\nto as far as our resources, right?\n\n14\n00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.912\nIf I need to access Office 365 or I'm\naccessing things inside of my network I\n\n15\n00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:58.240\nreally wanna do it based off\nof one set of credentials.\n\n16\n00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.310\nWe also have contrasted the very fact\nthat we can now call, same sign on,\n\n17\n00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.170\nwhere we essentially have two sets\nof credentials that are identical.\n\n18\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.460\nAnd if I go to Office 365,\n\n19\n00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.549\nI'm signing in there, that's actually\ngonna get us that one data base and\n\n20\n00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.980\nthen if I'm also doing the same thing,\nof course, at home or in my home network.\n\n21\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.720\nI actually have the same set\nof credentials over there too.\n\n22\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.180\nWith single sign on what we're\nactually saying is that ability,\n\n23\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.170\nregardless of where we go,\n\n24\n00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.510\nthat we are really only hitting one set\nat that's actually stored out there.\n\n25\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.130\nAnd, what we're talking about there\nis a source of authority, right?\n\n26\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.480\nThat is the one that's actually gonna\nallow us to do the authentication\n\n27\n00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.440\nthat we need.\n\n28\n00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.790\nSo, whether we think were only going\nto Office365 by opening up a web page,\n\n29\n00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.990\nit actually is gonna re-direct us to\nactually authenticate against my on\n\n30\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.560\npremises active directory as well.\n\n31\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.790\nSo, we talked about the planning\nof this in a previous episode and\n\n32\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.580\nmake sure you go over that\nparticular episode as well,\n\n33\n00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.860\nbecause there are some things\nthat have to actually be on hand\n\n34\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.550\nbefore we can actually get the single sign\non process set up the way that we want to.\n\n35\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.700\nSo, what we're gonna do today though,\nis we're simply gonna take you through\n\n36\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.850\nthe extra, or the additional server\nthat really needs to be set up\n\n37\n00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.790\nIf you're choosing to implement the idea\nof single sign on with your on premises\n\n38\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.730\nactive directory and\nwith your Office 365 directory as well.\n\n39\n00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.020\nAnd, that is what we're\nactually setting up to.\n\n40\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.690\nSo, what we're actually talking about\nright now then is setting up what we call,\n\n41\n00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.770\nactually, the acronym's\na little bit Unusual, right?\n\n42\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.610\nADFS.\nNow, if you go, that sounds familiar.\n\n43\n00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.530\nYou look down at your keyboard, and you\ndo see that there's a row of keys that's\n\n44\n00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.960\nASDF, and so\na lot of people do get that confused.\n\n45\n00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.930\nI know i get it confused\nevery once in awhile.\n\n46\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.839\nBut, we're not talking about\nthe row of keys, right?\n\n47\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.290\nADFS stands for\nActive Directory Federation Services.\n\n48\n00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.810\nSo, this particular server that we're\nactually going to set up is what will\n\n49\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.800\nhandle the idea of single sign on for us.\n\n50\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.760\nWhen we log in, essentially we're\ngonna hit that Federation server.\n\n51\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.450\nAnd, that federation server is actually\ngoing to be able to say all right,\n\n52\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.390\nyou authenticate against your on premises\nactive directory and once that's done\n\n53\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.540\nthat federation server also has\na certificate on it that resources,\n\n54\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.190\nmaybe not even inside of your network,\nwill automatically trust.\n\n55\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.830\nSo, you go out and get a third party\ncertificate and you install that on that\n\n56\n00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.440\nfederation server, And then, when you\nchoose to go to something like Office 365,\n\n57\n00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.200\nwell remember that what happens here is\nthat that particular federation server,\n\n58\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.600\nit will end up sending out\nwhat we call a security token,\n\n59\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.940\nis what will end up happening,\nand it will go to Office 365.\n\n60\n00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.670\nOffice365 will trust that and will trust\nthe claims on that particular token.\n\n61\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.680\nThat will allow you access to whatever\nresources are out there as well.\n\n62\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.500\nSo, it allows us to not have\nto worry about actually,\n\n63\n00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.320\ntwo different locations of\ndifferent things that are going on.\n\n64\n00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.500\nWe only really have to worry\nabout what's on premises.\n\n65\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.850\nNow, This also works of course, in\nconjunction with directory synchronization\n\n66\n00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.260\nand if you have ready set it up then\nyou don't have to worry a part of it.\n\n67\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.880\nBut if you haven't,\nyou decide to set this up first,\n\n68\n00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.190\nwell it doesn't work until you actually\nalso do the directory synchronization.\n\n69\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.988\nSo, the good thing is,\nin previous episodes,\n\n70\n00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:23.040\nwe've also all ready setup the directory\nsynchronization to work to.\n\n71\n00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.990\nSo, what do we have to\nhave when we set this up?\n\n72\n00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.810\nRemember to take a look at the planning.\n\n73\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.590\nYou do need a third-party\ntrusted certificate,\n\n74\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.610\nis what you're also gonna need.\n\n75\n00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.980\nIf you do not have the ability of course\nto have a public IP address, well\n\n76\n00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.120\nthen there's actually a couple of things\nthat you're not gonna be able to do.\n\n77\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.320\nFrom inside of your network, you'll be\nable to use the Federational Services\n\n78\n00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.980\nto get you access over Office 365,\nbut nowhere outside of your\n\n79\n00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.940\nActive Directory network will\nyou be able to do that as well.\n\n80\n00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.500\nSo, there's a couple of things\nthat you'll have to have on hand.\n\n81\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.260\nAll right, so, now that we've kind of\ngot an idea, we wanna walk through this\n\n82\n00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.940\nprocess of getting Active Directory\nFederation Services set up and\n\n83\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.870\nthen connecting it to Office 365 and\n\n84\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.860\nfrom that point we'll actually move\non to do some other things here.\n\n85\n00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.410\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n86\n00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.000\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine and\n\n87\n00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.770\nthis will kind of help us out here.\n\n88\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.080\nOne of the things that they do recommend\nis that we use a service account,\n\n89\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.080\nis what we actually want to use here.\n\n90\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.668\nWell, what does service account does for\nus?\n\n91\n00:05:25.668 --> 00:05:29.490\nA password that's not\ngonna expire by default or\n\n92\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.200\nby the dynamic way that active directory\nautomatically does this for us.\n\n93\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.450\nIt will actually just stay there.\n\n94\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.310\nAnd we will need to make sure that it has,\nlet's say, domain admin privileges.\n\n95\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.930\nSo let's go ahead and create that first.\n\n96\n00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.950\nSo, I'm gonna bring up my server\nmanager and inside of Server Manager,\n\n97\n00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.210\nI'm gonna go up to tools.\n\n98\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.380\nI need to kind of let it finishing\nadding all this stuff in here.\n\n99\n00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.820\nThere we go.\nAnd then I go up to Tools and\n\n100\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.650\nselect Active Directory Users and\nComputers.\n\n101\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.810\nAnd, inside of Active Directory Users and\nComputers, I can create a user.\n\n102\n00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.000\nNow, we can create it wherever we want to.\n\n103\n00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.140\nI'm gonna put it inside of this little\nManagement OU that I've also created,\n\n104\n00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.070\nI'm gonna right click, go to new,\nand select a user account.\n\n105\n00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.440\nAnd here, we'll call this one, let's see,\n\n106\n00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.360\nthe first name will be adfs and\nthen last name we'll call it service.\n\n107\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.020\nAnd for the user log on\nname we'll do adfs-service.\n\n108\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.100\nAnd that way it'll be easy for\n\n109\n00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.890\nme to distinguish that this\nwill be a service account.\n\n110\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.021\nI'll click Next here, and\nthen I'll enter in a password.\n\n111\n00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.640\nUncheck the user changing password,\nand then put a check mark here.\n\n112\n00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.950\nThe password never expires.\n\n113\n00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.990\nClick Okay.\n\n114\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.135\nAnd go ahead and click Finish.\n\n115\n00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:49.470\nI'm not done yet.\n\n116\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.450\nRemember that if I just create a standard\nuser account, and right click and\n\n117\n00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:59.380\ngo to properties,\nit's here if I go up to \"Member of\" tab.\n\n118\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.080\nAnd notice it's part of\nthe domain users group.\n\n119\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.888\nI'm going to click add, and then add\nthem into the domain admins instead.\n\n120\n00:07:07.888 --> 00:07:10.390\nAnd that will give all of\nthe permissions necessary, of course,\n\n121\n00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.020\nto be able to install the Active Directory\nFederation Services role as well.\n\n122\n00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.010\nAnd then I can remove them\nfrom the domain users.\n\n123\n00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.610\nOh, I have to actually select\nthis as being my primary group.\n\n124\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.050\nAnd then,\nI can select domain users and remove.\n\n125\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.190\nNo need to have them in a couple\nof different groups there, so\n\n126\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.260\nwe're just going to do that, all right?\n\n127\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.770\nSo, we want that service account because\nwhen we start installing it's gonna ask us\n\n128\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.830\na couple of places where\nour service account is.\n\n129\n00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.490\nRemember that if we don't use\na standard service account,\n\n130\n00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.880\nthe problem that we have is simple,\nis that the password will expire, and\n\n131\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.900\nDaniel, what happens when we\nactually have a Password expiration\n\n132\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.430\nin the middle of something that's\nalways trying to do something with.\n\n133\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.530\n>> Then it will break.\n\n134\n00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.780\nYou will break your service it will not\nwork, because what happens to password\n\n135\n00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.580\nexpires and it's going to ask the service\naccount to change the password.\n\n136\n00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.521\nWell, here's the problem, right?\n\n137\n00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:01.108\nUnfortunately there is no\nreal person behind there.\n\n138\n00:08:01.108 --> 00:08:02.754\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess if you were some sort\n\n139\n00:08:02.754 --> 00:08:06.736\nof programming genius, maybe you can Fix\nthat, but normally sys admins like Ronnie\n\n140\n00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.989\nand I, we're not that wherewithal\nwhen it comes to programming, so\n\n141\n00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:13.940\nwe wanna just set it to where it never\nexpires and we don't have that problem.\n\n142\n00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.140\nAgain, like we said before in previous\nepisodes, it doesn't mean the password\n\n143\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.400\nnever get's changed, it just means\nthat it is set to not expire and\n\n144\n00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.120\nwe as admins will just put that on\nour duty roster and as we get to it,\n\n145\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.200\nwe'll change them eventually\nfrom time to time.\n\n146\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.181\n>> Yeah, so Daniel gives us a great point,\n\n147\n00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:32.370\nremember that you do need\nto change these passwords.\n\n148\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.210\nDoes that mean that I've\nalways changed them?\n\n149\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.520\nNo, does that mean I should have?\n\n150\n00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.490\nYes, at some point, but just kinda realize\nthat if you don't, right, in the middle of\n\n151\n00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.580\nsome of the things that Active\nDirectory Federation Services is doing,\n\n152\n00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.640\nif the password expires well, we're not\ngoing to actually have that Federation and\n\n153\n00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.420\nthat's where we're going to have a issue.\n\n154\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.960\nSo, we need that first,\ngood thing we've set that up.\n\n155\n00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.540\nSecondly, we need to install the roll.\n\n156\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.850\nNow, this actually does depend on\nthe version of server that you're using.\n\n157\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.050\nOkay, if you're using Server 2008 or\n\n158\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.390\nearlier, you will not have\nActive Directory Federation Services as\n\n159\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.700\npart of the ability to\ninstall it as a role.\n\n160\n00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.700\nYou normally would have to go out\nto Microsoft and download whatever\n\n161\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.020\nFederation Services version that\nyour operating system will use.\n\n162\n00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.996\nThe recommendation of course\ntoday is that you at least use\n\n163\n00:09:20.996 --> 00:09:24.983\nActive Directory Federation Services\n2.0 or higher.\n\n164\n00:09:24.983 --> 00:09:29.069\nIf you're already running server 2012,\nyou do not have to go and\n\n165\n00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:32.910\ndownload this, all you have to\ndo is simply install the role.\n\n166\n00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.540\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n167\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.150\nSo inside of my Server Manager\non the Dashboard,\n\n168\n00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.949\nI'm simply gonna click on Add roles and\nfeatures.\n\n169\n00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.260\nAnd inside of Add Roles and\nFeatures wizard.\n\n170\n00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.380\nWe're gonna click next right here,\nand we're gonna do the role based or\n\n171\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.080\nfeature based installation, and then\nwe're just gonna choose a server here.\n\n172\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.150\nActually, I need to go to another server.\n\n173\n00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:59.030\nI already built up a federation server for\nus, so let me go over here to this one.\n\n174\n00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.300\nI was about to install it\nright on my ad domain control,\n\n175\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.320\nthat would have been a bad idea.\n\n176\n00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.490\nNow, can you do that if you\nare in a real small environment?\n\n177\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.670\nYou better believe it.\n\n178\n00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.795\nYou definitely can do that but\n\n179\n00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:12.680\nlet's just do this one on the stand alone\nand let me bring up that server manager.\n\n180\n00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.160\nSo once the server manager comes up\nwe're going to go to the same place and\n\n181\n00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.199\nthen do the add rolls and features wizard.\n\n182\n00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.770\nAnd I'm gonna click next and next and\n\n183\n00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.300\nthen select the server that's\nactually right there for me.\n\n184\n00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.350\nAnd what I'm looking for is right there,\n\n185\n00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.070\nActive Directory Federation Services is\nthe one that I'm going to check here.\n\n186\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.920\nSo it actually does tell us what it does,\nsimplified, secured identity federation.\n\n187\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.340\nSingle web, single sign-on.\n\n188\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.240\nI can't say that.\n\n189\n00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.350\nCapabilities.\n\n190\n00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.010\nAnd so this is what we're looking for.\n\n191\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.940\nSo do remember the name\nof that server role.\n\n192\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.700\nGo ahead and click Next here.\n\n193\n00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.950\nAnd there's a couple of different\nthings that you need to verify that\n\n194\n00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.860\nare also installed or\nyou need to install them.\n\n195\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.970\nYou're gonna need .NET 3.5.\n\n196\n00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:00.590\nOkay?\n\n197\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.510\nIs what you're also gonna need.\n\n198\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.330\nThe other thing that you'll also need\nif you do not have it installed yet\n\n199\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.890\nis going to be IIS, which is Microsoft\nversion, of course, of the web server.\n\n200\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.500\nYou can see over on the left hand side,\nI've already got that installed, but\n\n201\n00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.570\nif you didn't leave it at the default.\n\n202\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.437\nMake sure that that's installed for\nyou and\n\n203\n00:11:18.437 --> 00:11:22.621\nthen if I scroll on down a little\nbit further, we're looking for\n\n204\n00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:26.828\nsomething else that says\nWindows Process Activation Service.\n\n205\n00:11:26.828 --> 00:11:31.562\nAnd I want to make sure that I\nexpand that out and add in this,\n\n206\n00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:35.185\nat least a .net environment here, 3.5.\n\n207\n00:11:35.185 --> 00:11:38.943\nI can add in the configuration API\nwhile I was gonna do programming, but\n\n208\n00:11:38.943 --> 00:11:40.705\nlet's go ahead and just do that.\n\n209\n00:11:42.554 --> 00:11:46.440\nFrom that point, it's gonna\ncontinue to walk me through this.\n\n210\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.600\nAnd here's a couple of things we\ndo want to actually verify, right?\n\n211\n00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.190\nSo I'm gonna actually go ahead and\nput a check mark, and\n\n212\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.750\nsee if it actually needs restarting,\nif it actually needs that process.\n\n213\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.190\nGives me a summary here, and now,\n\n214\n00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.770\nonce I have everything ready to go,\nI simply click install at this point.\n\n215\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.730\nAnd now it's gonna be installing\nthe service in the background.\n\n216\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.650\nAll right, so it just finished installing\nright now, and you'll see that it gives me\n\n217\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:16.040\na link here to continue to configure the\nfederation server, but before we do that,\n\n218\n00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.010\nthere's a couple of other things I wanna\nmake sure that is pointed out right now,\n\n219\n00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:24.360\nthen we'll go back and\nwe'll configure the federation server.\n\n220\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.460\nBecause of the way that the federation\nserver works with the certificates.\n\n221\n00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.820\nWe need to go ahead and\ninstall that certificate as well.\n\n222\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.870\nRemember that this means you're gonna go\nout and get a third party certificate and\n\n223\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.310\nyou can get a wild card certificate if you\nwant to, if you company can afford it.\n\n224\n00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.870\nYou can get one specifically for that\nparticular server which is what I did,\n\n225\n00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.050\nis I got one for\nthis particular server here.\n\n226\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.580\nAnd then you wanna make sure\nit actually gets installed.\n\n227\n00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.590\nSo the way that you do that is you\ngo over to your web server, and\n\n228\n00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:59.240\nthen I'm gonna right-click and then bring\nup the internet information services\n\n229\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.590\nhere, and then select the server\nover in the left-hand side.\n\n230\n00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.200\nI'm not gonna worry about the component.\n\n231\n00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.250\nAnd what we want is right here, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.930\nWe're looking for\nwhere it says Server Certificates.\n\n233\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.410\nAnd you'll see I actually\nalready have it installed.\n\n234\n00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.770\nIt's the one that I already have\ninstalled here, which is for SSL, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.390\nSo remember that if you don't have this,\nyou will need to go and sign up for one.\n\n236\n00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.060\nAnd the good thing is,\nif you're practicing, okay, they do.\n\n237\n00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.080\nAnd most of the third party,\nI don't want to say most,\n\n238\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.640\nsome of those third party websites out\nthere that have an actual true CA,\n\n239\n00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.890\na Certificate Authority,\nout there on the web.\n\n240\n00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.940\nThey will give you the ability to test\nthis out in your situation when you go,\n\n241\n00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.240\nhey I don't know how to actually install\na certificate on to a web server.\n\n242\n00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.040\nYou can generate let's\nsay a 30 day request for\n\n243\n00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.860\na singles certificate that's not going to\nbe valid for anything longer than that.\n\n244\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.250\nThat's what I have here on this one.\n\n245\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.460\nSo, if you were actually doing that for\nthe first time, you would simply\n\n246\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.000\ncreate a certificate request here, fill\nout all the information and at the end,\n\n247\n00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.090\nit's going to generate a file; that\nthen you're going to go to the website.\n\n248\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.610\nPaste that information in, and then you'll\nhave to fill out all the stuff that you\n\n249\n00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.330\nneed to, and then they'll send\nyou a certificate back and\n\n250\n00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.100\nyou follow their instructions\nto get that installed back in.\n\n251\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.670\nOkay, now once we get that\ninstalled into our server,\n\n252\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.010\none other thing you need to do here.\n\n253\n00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.490\nSo I'm gonna click back\non sites at this point.\n\n254\n00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.180\nIn the center in the details section,\nI'm gonna select default website.\n\n255\n00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.890\nOver here on the right hand side,\nI'm gonna click on Bindings, okay?\n\n256\n00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.600\nAnd in Bindings, you wanna make sure\nthat you click the Add button, and\n\n257\n00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.680\nwhat you want is https.\n\n258\n00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.190\nAnd it doesn't matter\nwhat the addresses are,\n\n259\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.140\nyou don't even have to\nworry about the hostname.\n\n260\n00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.220\nBut what you're looking for is that\ncertificate that you actually have.\n\n261\n00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.310\nSo I named mine SSL,\nyou would select that one, and\n\n262\n00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.060\nthen from that point you add a binding in,\nit should add right in, so\n\n263\n00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.500\nthat I have one for\nHTTPS as well as this, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:06.290\nAnd that is going to be the way that our\nsecurity token service ends up working.\n\n265\n00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.200\nSo that now when we authenticate\nthe federation service end,\n\n266\n00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.230\nwhen it says hey, Daniel was trying to get\nOffice 365, it generates an STS token.\n\n267\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:19.460\nAll the claims of Daniel's, what he wants\nto get access to will also be there and\n\n268\n00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.990\nbecause Office 365 trusts my third\nparty certificate here, well, then it\n\n269\n00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.570\nwill actually go ahead and do everything\nthat it needs to, to give him access up to\n\n270\n00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.910\nOffice 365 without ever having to\nactually enter in credentials again.\n\n271\n00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.720\nSo that's the way that it ends up\nworking in the background, okay?\n\n272\n00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.760\nSo now that we have that\ninstalled on the server itself,\n\n273\n00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.470\nnow we need to go back and configure\nthe rest of the federation services here.\n\n274\n00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.074\nSo the good thing is, I have a couple\nof options that I can do this with.\n\n275\n00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:53.716\nUp here I have my Notifications flag,\nI click on that little tiny warning sign,\n\n276\n00:15:53.716 --> 00:15:58.430\nand then select the link here that says\nconfigure the federation services on this\n\n277\n00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.694\nserver, and this is what we have to\nwalk through the rest of here, okay.\n\n278\n00:16:02.694 --> 00:16:04.242\nSo notice what's gonna happen.\n\n279\n00:16:04.242 --> 00:16:07.537\nSays before you begin it's asking for\na couple of things.\n\n280\n00:16:07.537 --> 00:16:12.268\nOne, an Active Directory administrator\naccount, and we want this one to be our\n\n281\n00:16:12.268 --> 00:16:17.068\nservice account that we created, the\nADFS-service account, the one I created\n\n282\n00:16:17.068 --> 00:16:22.580\nand made a part of the domain admins and\nmade sure that the password didn't expire.\n\n283\n00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:28.620\nAnd two, the publicly trusted certificate\nfor SSL server authentication.\n\n284\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.599\nSo that is the second one that I actually\nneed, and I already have that, and\n\n285\n00:16:32.599 --> 00:16:35.504\nI've installed it into my\nweb server at this point, so\n\n286\n00:16:35.504 --> 00:16:38.497\nit's actually part of that\ncertificate store as well.\n\n287\n00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:41.146\nNow notice down here at the bottom, and\n\n288\n00:16:41.146 --> 00:16:45.730\nthis is actually something we want\nto make sure that I mention here.\n\n289\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:50.471\nOn a small organization,\nif you have a really tiny organization and\n\n290\n00:16:50.471 --> 00:16:55.712\nit's hard to judge what's really tiny,\nbut let's say that less than 50\n\n291\n00:16:55.712 --> 00:17:00.810\nto 100 users, you do not have to\nsetup a separate federation server.\n\n292\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.907\nA standalone federation sever,\nyou don't have to do that.\n\n293\n00:17:03.907 --> 00:17:08.884\nYou can, in theory, install it where\nyour directory service is gonna be,\n\n294\n00:17:08.884 --> 00:17:14.550\nyour Active Directory is actually gonna\nbe stored on your domain controller.\n\n295\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:19.250\nBut if you know that your organization is\ngoing to grow, and you believe that that's\n\n296\n00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.610\nwhat's gonna happen, it is recommended\nregardless of the size, though,\n\n297\n00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:27.610\nthat you go ahead and say hey, let's go\nahead and dedicate another server to this.\n\n298\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.510\nNow this can be done in a virtual\nmachine if you want to.\n\n299\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.880\nYou don't always have to do it physically,\nbut you can do it right here.\n\n300\n00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.130\nAnd the reason why I wanna point that out\nis that right down here there's a couple\n\n301\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.070\nof options, a little bit more\ndifficult for you to see.\n\n302\n00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.250\nBut the first one says Create\nthe first federation server\n\n303\n00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.870\nin a federation server farm.\n\n304\n00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.770\nAnd the second one here says\nAdd a federation server\n\n305\n00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:52.320\nto a federation server farm.\n\n306\n00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.220\nSo of course, if this is your first\nfederation server you need to select\n\n307\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.940\nthe first one, makes sense.\n\n308\n00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.927\nBut what if your\norganization is growing and\n\n309\n00:17:58.927 --> 00:18:02.310\nyou realize that the reason why you're\nnot actually getting connected and\n\n310\n00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.598\ndoing the things you want to is that\nyou need another federation server?\n\n311\n00:18:05.598 --> 00:18:08.310\nWell, you don't wanna actually\ncreate another connection,\n\n312\n00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.700\nyou want to just simply add in that second\nconnection is what you're gonna do.\n\n313\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.690\nSo that's where you would choose\nto add in a second server to that.\n\n314\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.340\nBut we're gonna create this first one and\nclick Next.\n\n315\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.340\nAnd now it says specify\nthe Active Directory account with\n\n316\n00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.870\nadministration permissions\nto configure this.\n\n317\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:32.881\nI'm gonna change it from\nthe current user here to Oops,\n\n318\n00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:40.160\nitprotvdemo\\adfs-service and\n\n319\n00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.930\nenter in my password.\n\n320\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.480\nWe'll do that.\n\n321\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.690\nClick Next, and now it's asking for\nthat certificate.\n\n322\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.650\nNow if I had not actually\ninstalled that web server,\n\n323\n00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.680\nwhich is really gonna help me out,\nI'd have to import that certificate in.\n\n324\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.210\nAnd you can.\n\n325\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.420\nClick Import.\n\n326\n00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.381\nAnd I think I stored all this\nstuff under My Downloads.\n\n327\n00:19:03.381 --> 00:19:05.369\nOh, I'm lying to you,\nmaybe it's not in My Downloads.\n\n328\n00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.690\nI think it's Documents then.\n\n329\n00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.170\nSo it may actually be in there.\n\n330\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.170\nBut I actually saved them as files\nsomewhere, wherever I saved them before.\n\n331\n00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.670\nBut there it is.\n\n332\n00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:20.815\nHere is the one from my particular\nserver here, fs01_itprotv.\n\n333\n00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.810\nAnd then for this one,\nit's gonna be the same thing.\n\n334\n00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.320\nNow I could have genericized\nthis name instead, but\n\n335\n00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.300\nat this point I just left it\nexactly the same as my server.\n\n336\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.871\nAnd then on the display\nname I'm gonna call it\n\n337\n00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:40.973\nitprotvdemo, is what I'm going to do.\n\n338\n00:19:40.973 --> 00:19:43.086\nClick Next.\n\n339\n00:19:43.086 --> 00:19:47.335\nAnd now it's gonna say which one of these\ndo I want to actually be able to use here?\n\n340\n00:19:47.335 --> 00:19:54.013\nI'm gonna use the existing domain,\naccount name, and type an adfs-service and\n\n341\n00:19:54.013 --> 00:19:59.067\ncheck the names, and\nthen make sure I provide that password.\n\n342\n00:19:59.067 --> 00:20:02.277\nNow of course, the password should\nbe something that's complex, and\n\n343\n00:20:02.277 --> 00:20:04.160\nnot something you share with everybody.\n\n344\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.050\nBut overall make sure you do that.\n\n345\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.498\nNow if your organization is gonna grow,\n\n346\n00:20:08.498 --> 00:20:13.545\nyou're gonna wanna install your own SQL\nservice, is what you're gonna wanna do.\n\n347\n00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:15.940\nYour own SQL database instead.\n\n348\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.680\nBut if you don't, you can actually\nuse multiple servers to connect in\n\n349\n00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.320\nto a single Windows internal database.\n\n350\n00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.382\nThe only limitation here is that the\nmaximum size of your database is gonna be\n\n351\n00:20:27.382 --> 00:20:30.305\n10 GB if you use the one\nthat's actually right here.\n\n352\n00:20:30.305 --> 00:20:33.980\nNow I don't know how many records\n10 GB is, but it's a lot.\n\n353\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.950\nAt the some time, though, if your Active\nDirectory is constantly changing, if you\n\n354\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:43.010\nknow that you're constantly adding in more\nand more people, recommendation again?\n\n355\n00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:47.050\nBuild your own SQL database if you believe\nthat your organization is growing.\n\n356\n00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.127\nSo it makes sense.\n\n357\n00:20:48.127 --> 00:20:49.790\nAll right, let me click Next here.\n\n358\n00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:55.410\nAnd it says an error occurred at\nchecking if the database exists here or\n\n359\n00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.940\nmy username and database.\n\n360\n00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.480\nSo let me go ahead and pull that.\n\n361\n00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.645\nDid I select, let's see, maybe it was me.\n\n362\n00:21:04.701 --> 00:21:07.880\nThat's why.\n\n363\n00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.055\nIt says, Group Managed Service Accounts\nare not available because\n\n364\n00:21:11.055 --> 00:21:13.200\nKDS Root Key has not been set.\n\n365\n00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.710\nSo I have to manually set something up.\n\n366\n00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.680\nBut the funny thing is,\nit should let me continue through here.\n\n367\n00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.762\nLet's see if it actually does.\n\n368\n00:21:18.762 --> 00:21:21.740\nI'm gonna overwrite this\nexisting database for right now.\n\n369\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.910\nSo I previously also\nconfigured another one here.\n\n370\n00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.205\nSo if I go ahead and go on through\nthis and click Next, it may balk, but\n\n371\n00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:33.036\nnotice all the prerequisite checks passed.\n\n372\n00:21:33.036 --> 00:21:37.110\nAnd you're probably wondering why did it\nnot pass earlier, what happened there?\n\n373\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:41.240\nIt saw remnants of an older database,\nand it's saying no, I don't like that.\n\n374\n00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.240\nThen it saw that I actually added in\na new account name over something\n\n375\n00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.240\nthat it could have accessed with another\naccount before, so it's not really happy.\n\n376\n00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.650\nBut now it says that everything's checked,\npassed, and\n\n377\n00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.470\nnow we will configure,\nis what we will do here.\n\n378\n00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.316\nSo once everything is done at\nthis end as far as installing, so\n\n379\n00:22:00.316 --> 00:22:01.963\nit might take a moment or two,\n\n380\n00:22:01.963 --> 00:22:08.090\nwe then need to open up the Windows Azure\nActive Directory Module for Power Shell.\n\n381\n00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:11.570\nThat's a mouthful, Daniel, for anybody.\n\n382\n00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.960\nSo we need to be able to do that and\n\n383\n00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.830\nwe need to be able to set up\na couple of other things too.\n\n384\n00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.590\nSo here the only thing we've got is\neven though the server was successfully\n\n385\n00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:23.680\nconfigured, it also says an error\noccurred when it attempted to set\n\n386\n00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.220\na service principal name for\nthe specified service account as well.\n\n387\n00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.940\nAnd that's fine,\nit's not a blocker to the installation.\n\n388\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.150\nIt's just saying, hey, look, when you set\nup that service principal name, Ronnie,\n\n389\n00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.050\nmore than likely you did it under your\naccount and you didn't do it under\n\n390\n00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.838\nthe service account, so you may\nwant to go back in and change that.\n\n391\n00:22:42.838 --> 00:22:46.140\nIt's not gonna hurt us right now,\nbut, yes, in a real environment,\n\n392\n00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.260\nwe would do that instead,\nis what we would end up doing.\n\n393\n00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.270\nSo now we've essentially\nfinished configuring\n\n394\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.130\nfederation services and the IIS.\n\n395\n00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.420\nSo we have now our service account.\n\n396\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.250\nWe have our web server that helped\nus to install the certificate.\n\n397\n00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.780\nWe now have federation services\nnot only installed but\n\n398\n00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.090\nat least basically configured.\n\n399\n00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:14.460\nAnd now we've gotta check a couple of\nother things before we go on here.\n\n400\n00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.950\nAnd so what do we need to check?\n\n401\n00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:24.360\nWell, what we need to do, is we need to\nconnect to our online login account here.\n\n402\n00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.320\nAnd so we'll do that.\n\n403\n00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:31.260\nSo I'm going to go to\nlogin.microsoftonline.com, and\n\n404\n00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.320\nselect my account here.\n\n405\n00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.978\nAnd I need to get my password.\n\n406\n00:23:34.978 --> 00:23:38.800\nAnd let me go ahead and\ndo a quick password copy here.\n\n407\n00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.909\nOops, I went too far.\n\n408\n00:23:43.864 --> 00:23:44.650\nPaste it here.\n\n409\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.940\nAnd let me sign in.\n\n410\n00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.238\nIf you have never connected\nin this way before,\n\n411\n00:23:51.238 --> 00:23:55.217\nthere's a couple of other things that\nmay need to be done on this end.\n\n412\n00:23:55.217 --> 00:23:57.079\nSo I'm going to click\non that little button,\n\n413\n00:23:57.079 --> 00:23:58.750\nthat actually gives us all the options.\n\n414\n00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.083\nAnd then go to admin.\n\n415\n00:24:02.637 --> 00:24:05.666\nVerify I Iogged with the right name cuz\nI've been doing a couple of different\n\n416\n00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:06.291\nthings today.\n\n417\n00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.440\nYep, that's me, okay?\n\n418\n00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.699\nAnd then I'm gonna select Users and\nActive Users.\n\n419\n00:24:14.231 --> 00:24:15.210\nOkay?\n\n420\n00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:19.630\nIf you have not set up\nSingle Sign-On before to your\n\n421\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:24.820\nOffice 365, you may notice that there'll\nbe a fourth link up here at the top\n\n422\n00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.660\nthat will talk about setting\nup Single Sign-On, okay?\n\n423\n00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.530\nIt will pretty much give you\na little button that says Yes,\n\n424\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.530\nI want to use Single Sign-On.\n\n425\n00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:34.440\nMake sense?\n\n426\n00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.230\nSo then we should actually\nbe able to press and do and\n\n427\n00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.730\nthat's perfectly fine if you\nchoose to do it that way.\n\n428\n00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:40.350\nOkay.\n\n429\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.060\nSo, because I have set it up before,\n\n430\n00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:47.650\nmine doesn't show up as a brand new\noption for me to re-set it up here.\n\n431\n00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:52.680\nIt does show me an option that I\ndon't really need right now, but\n\n432\n00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.060\nonce we have that set up.\n\n433\n00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.660\nLet me go back to where I need, which is\nnot in the Server Manager for right now.\n\n434\n00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:04.430\nBut I need to bring up that Windows Azure\nActive Directory Module for PowerShell.\n\n435\n00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.070\nAnd I'll launch that up right here.\n\n436\n00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:11.340\nAnd now we need to make sure that we\ngo ahead and set it up from this end.\n\n437\n00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:16.590\nSo you don't always have to go to\nthe online portal to set it up.\n\n438\n00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.930\nYou can also do it from right here.\n\n439\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.830\nSo I need to go ahead and connect\ninto Microsoft services online here.\n\n440\n00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:30.881\nSo it's gonna be connect-msolservice.\n\n441\n00:25:30.881 --> 00:25:33.282\nType in my credentials.\n\n442\n00:25:39.783 --> 00:25:42.546\nPaste in my super secret password.\n\n443\n00:25:44.822 --> 00:25:49.874\nAnd there it is I am now connected in,\nand once I connect in I now need to go\n\n444\n00:25:49.874 --> 00:25:56.290\nahead and set up what we call the Active\nDirectory Federation Services Context.\n\n445\n00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:00.590\nIn other words, where am I actually\ntelling Office 365 to look?\n\n446\n00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.000\nThat's what I'm trying to do.\n\n447\n00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.900\nSo I type in set-msoladfs.\n\n448\n00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.420\nI know you can't believe\nthat this is actually true.\n\n449\n00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.170\nContext is what I need to do.\n\n450\n00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.470\nAnd then we type in a computer name.\n\n451\n00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.430\nSo this is Computer, and this is gonna\n\n452\n00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:29.080\nbe fs01.itprotvdemo.com.\n\n453\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.600\nNow you might be wondering like okay, so\n\n454\n00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.160\nwe're doing this online somewhere and\nthis gonna look for this?\n\n455\n00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.270\nYes, it's a fully qualified domain name.\n\n456\n00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.070\nSo in theory office online can do what?\n\n457\n00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:42.390\nIt should able to query on the internet,\nfind this particular computer, all right?\n\n458\n00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:46.370\n>> All about making those cloud services\nintegrate with your on premise devices.\n\n459\n00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.910\nRight, Ronnie?\n\n460\n00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:47.670\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n461\n00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:48.480\nYes.\nAnd that's\n\n462\n00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.140\nwhat we need to make sure that we do,\nright?\n\n463\n00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.860\nSo notice it accepted it, right?\n\n464\n00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.820\nIf we have errors at this point,\nwe might need to go back and check.\n\n465\n00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.810\nDid we register our DNS\nup there on Office 365,\n\n466\n00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:03.070\ncuz those are also prerequisites as well,\nright?\n\n467\n00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:06.750\nSo if you haven't done that yet and you\njust thought that what you would do right,\n\n468\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.310\nis jump into this particular show and go,\nthe only thing I need is Single Sign-On.\n\n469\n00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.514\nBut you haven't set up your tenant account\nand you haven't done anything else yet\n\n470\n00:27:13.514 --> 00:27:16.410\nlike setting up your DNS,\nwell it's not gonna work.\n\n471\n00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.890\nSo make sure you at least get\nyour DNS set up correctly.\n\n472\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.270\nIf you actually get an error here,\nusually,\n\n473\n00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.010\nthat's probably the problem,\njust about right away.\n\n474\n00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:28.302\nThe next thing that we also need to do,\nthen,\n\n475\n00:27:28.302 --> 00:27:33.100\nis we now need to take the way that\nwe're doing the authentication.\n\n476\n00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.860\nI was trying [LAUGH] to\nremember what word to use.\n\n477\n00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.720\nThe authentication.\n\n478\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.720\nInstead of doing a standard\nauthentication, we need for\n\n479\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.020\nall of our accounts to do what we\ncall a federated authentication.\n\n480\n00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.760\nAnd what that means is, even my\nOn Premises Active Directory accounts,\n\n481\n00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.910\nthey're gonna hit the federation\nserver before they come back and\n\n482\n00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.000\nactually authenticate.\n\n483\n00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.760\nOkay.\n\n484\n00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.520\nSo that's the second\nthing that we also need.\n\n485\n00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.080\nAnd this will also help as well,\nregardless of where you are.\n\n486\n00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.325\nSo this one is convert-msol.\n\n487\n00:28:00.325 --> 00:28:06.330\nSo, Microsoft online DomainToFederated,\nokay?\n\n488\n00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:08.390\nSo, remember to use that tab fill.\n\n489\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.940\nSo, we're converting the domain\naccounts here to the federated.\n\n490\n00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.445\nAnd then I need a dash DomainName.\n\n491\n00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:26.049\nIt's going to be itprotvdemo.com.\n\n492\n00:28:26.049 --> 00:28:29.910\nAll right so let me see here,\nwhat did I type in wrong?\n\n493\n00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.080\nCannot convert because the account that\nyou're currently using is signed in.\n\n494\n00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.510\nNow this is actually a good error, okay?\n\n495\n00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:39.490\nThe reason why this is a good\nerror is because of this.\n\n496\n00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:42.040\nIt's saying, Ronnie,\nyou're part of that domain.\n\n497\n00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.310\nAnd you're saying you're\nsigned in with it, and\n\n498\n00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.280\nyou want me to convert it at the same\ntime, I'm not gonna let you do that, okay?\n\n499\n00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.040\nSo what it means is I need to\nkind of sign out of this thing.\n\n500\n00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:56.610\nAnd I need to actually enter in\nanother set of credentials instead.\n\n501\n00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:02.963\nSo when I do the msol-, oh excuse me,\n\n502\n00:29:02.963 --> 00:29:07.539\nconnect-msolservices.\n\n503\n00:29:07.539 --> 00:29:11.872\nOops, that was not services you see,\nmsolservice,\n\n504\n00:29:11.872 --> 00:29:17.680\nI need an account that's not\nexactly inside of my domain here.\n\n505\n00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.710\nSo if I go back to my active users\nhere just for a moment, I do have,\n\n506\n00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:26.550\nI believe, an actual account out here.\n\n507\n00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.940\nIf I don't, I'll need to create one.\n\n508\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:37.820\nBut I do have an account out here\ncalled administrator, if I can find it.\n\n509\n00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:38.630\nThere it is.\n\n510\n00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.440\nAdministrator, notice that it's\nonly one that's in the cloud, okay?\n\n511\n00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.930\nSo this is not synched at\nwith my active directory, so\n\n512\n00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.700\nthat's the one I'm going to use\nhere if I can find the correct.\n\n513\n00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.450\nThere we go, one here.\n\n514\n00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:54.410\nSo it can be administrator at ITPro.\n\n515\n00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:58.328\nActually, we'll try that.\n\n516\n00:29:58.328 --> 00:30:01.566\nITProTVdemo.com.\n\n517\n00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:05.730\nAll right, so after entering in\na couple of passwords incorrectly,\n\n518\n00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.640\nhere I did look at my password and\nI now I am actually connected in.\n\n519\n00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.840\nNow, remember, that what it really\nis complaining about right,\n\n520\n00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.410\nis you get to this point just like\nI did and it tells you that hey,\n\n521\n00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.940\nyou can't do this because\nremember that domain.\n\n522\n00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.750\nYou need to log out, and\nthen you need to actually go back and\n\n523\n00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:25.090\nremember maybe that first global\nadministrator account that you created.\n\n524\n00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.550\nAnd the reason why you need to do that, is\nbecause it's probably not joined to your\n\n525\n00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:32.960\nactive directory domain but it still\nhas the ability to change your tenet,\n\n526\n00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:38.710\nand so that's the one that I'm using\nright here is that one I believe.\n\n527\n00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:40.720\nAnd so let's see here.\n\n528\n00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.910\nYou'll notice something, before I do\nthat I got to check on one other thing\n\n529\n00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:46.300\nbecause I just realized something.\n\n530\n00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:52.282\nIt may not, I may not, that is not\nactually going to end up working for us.\n\n531\n00:31:00.501 --> 00:31:01.820\n>> And why is that running?\n\n532\n00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.030\n>> Well, it's because I did not actually\nset it as the global administrator.\n\n533\n00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.460\n>> And even though I thought I did,\nI did not do that.\n\n534\n00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.329\nSo, I need to make sure I do something\nlike that and [CROSSTALK] It\n\n535\n00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:17.222\nis actually very important, and that means\nI need to log in again with this one.\n\n536\n00:31:17.222 --> 00:31:21.545\nSo, every once in a while I set all these\nthings up, you know, in my mind at least,\n\n537\n00:31:21.545 --> 00:31:25.010\nbut apparently not very well in\nreality do I actually set them up.\n\n538\n00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.970\n>> You know, that's a really good real\nworld scenario, to be honest with you.\n\n539\n00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:32.520\nThese are the kind of things that\nare easily forgotten as you're working\n\n540\n00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.430\nas an admin, right?\n\n541\n00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:37.730\nPeople think, oh, man, I've gotta know\nevery little tick and check mark and\n\n542\n00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:38.240\nradio button.\n\n543\n00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.290\nYou don't.\n\n544\n00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:42.170\nJust as long as you're familiar with it,\nyou should be able to get by and go, oh,\n\n545\n00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:42.860\nI forgot to do that.\n\n546\n00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.250\nYou go back and you do it.\n\n547\n00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.290\nIt's when we're talking\nabout taking an exam.\n\n548\n00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.955\nThat's when it's really important to\nhave that stuff burned into the brain.\n\n549\n00:31:49.955 --> 00:31:51.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's little things that.\n\n550\n00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:52.560\nI'm not kidding you.\n\n551\n00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.000\nThey will test you.\n\n552\n00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.160\nOn the fact,\ndid you make it a global administer?\n\n553\n00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.530\nIf not, it's not going to work and that\nwhere they'll get you on an exam question.\n\n554\n00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:04.340\nSo make sure that it's the little weird\ndetails that you think aren't really that\n\n555\n00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:08.910\nbig of a deal, that's what you bury into\nyour brain for when you go take the exam.\n\n556\n00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.320\n>> Now that I'm actually connected in,\n\n557\n00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.590\nremember that I have to connect in now\nwith an account that is not gonna be\n\n558\n00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:19.290\npart of my current active directory\nthat's on premise as well.\n\n559\n00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:23.250\nSo I've logged off and I've logged back\nin with this particular account that is\n\n560\n00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:28.660\na global administrator in Office 365, but\nnot a part of my directory is what I have.\n\n561\n00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:32.960\nAnd now I need to convert,\nso I'm gonna do a convert.\n\n562\n00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.390\nIf I spell it right it would help.\n\n563\n00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:40.838\nConvert-msol, Microsoft Online,\n\n564\n00:32:40.838 --> 00:32:43.720\nDomainToFederate.\n\n565\n00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.430\nRemember that we actually are saying,\ndon't do the standard way anymore.\n\n566\n00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:52.570\nNow use the federated services instead for\nall those accounts and I'm doing this for\n\n567\n00:32:52.570 --> 00:33:01.360\nmy entire domain here of itprotvdemo.com.\n\n568\n00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.900\nPress Enter and we'll give it a moment and\nwe'll see what happens here.\n\n569\n00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.260\nNow we'll either verify that\nI've successfully done this and\n\n570\n00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.930\nnow we're actually using the federated\nservices or it will tell me I'm wrong.\n\n571\n00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:16.290\nA lot of red letters is normally what will\nend up happening, so right here you get\n\n572\n00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:21.290\nthe key that tells you that you've\nsuccessfully updated this domain.\n\n573\n00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:24.780\nSo that now all the users\nare essentially gonna end up using\n\n574\n00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:30.180\nthe federated services when they log in,\nis what we will end up seeing here.\n\n575\n00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.020\nSo this will actually mean another\nchange that we'll actually see.\n\n576\n00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.520\nInstead of going to the online portal,\nyou'll see that when you connect there,\n\n577\n00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.830\nit will automatically take\nyou to your company's portal,\n\n578\n00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.160\nwhich sent you to that federated server.\n\n579\n00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.922\nBut Daniel that's actually for another\nshow cuz you've let me talk way too long.\n\n580\n00:33:46.922 --> 00:33:48.730\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Well Ronnie,\n\n581\n00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:49.950\nyou had a lot of good information.\n\n582\n00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.650\nThis is a very important\nkind of topic if you want to\n\n583\n00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.700\nuse that Single Sign-On environment.\n\n584\n00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.440\nWell and this is the kind of thing\nyou've gotta walk through, you just have\n\n585\n00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.025\nto go through it, make sure all the i's\nare dotted and lower case j's as well.\n\n586\n00:34:02.025 --> 00:34:04.270\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> We don't want to leave anything out.\n\n587\n00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.550\nSo Ronnie, it's fine.\n\n588\n00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:09.255\nI think it was a good thing that I let\nyou talk, if I can even talk myself.\n\n589\n00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:10.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n590\n00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.970\nget that information out to our viewers.\n\n591\n00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:15.300\nBut like you said,\nwe got a little more to cover so\n\n592\n00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.600\nwe'll have to jump into a part two for\nthis.\n\n593\n00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.820\nHopefully we'll see you there as well.\n\n594\n00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.230\nRonnie, I'm gonna go ahead and\nthank you for what you've shown us so far.\n\n595\n00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.760\nI look forward to seeing\nyou there in that part two.\n\n596\n00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.270\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou there as well.\n\n597\n00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.060\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n598\n00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.960\nI've been your host, Daniel Lawry.\n\n599\n00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.530\n>> And I'm Ronnie Long.\n\n600\n00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.894\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n601\n00:34:29.894 --> 00:34:35.380\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:18.280\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.760\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\non with our Office 365 Identities and\n\n5\n00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.880\nRequirements series,\nwe're working so hard on.\n\n6\n00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.020\nJoining me in the studio today.\n\n7\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.915\nYou know him, you love him,\nhe is our good friend.\n\n8\n00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:29.170\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.130\nRonnie welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.050\nHow you doing today sir?\n\n11\n00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.770\n>> I'm doing fine.\n\n12\n00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.490\nIt's another great day to be right here,\n\n13\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.500\nas we continue on taking\na look at Office 365.\n\n14\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.610\nAnd we're actually in the middle of\nreally doing the singles sign on, rIght.\n\n15\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.840\nMaking sure that our active directory,\nour on premises active directory,\n\n16\n00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.560\nas well as Office 365 active directory,\nare going to allow us to be able to not\n\n17\n00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.310\nonly synchronize together, but to actually\nhave a single sign on between them.\n\n18\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.510\nSo that is really what the function of\nsome of the things that we've been doing.\n\n19\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.480\nIn last, in another episode, in another\nepisode, last episode that we had.\n\n20\n00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.840\nWe went ahead and showed you how to\nget the federation server installed.\n\n21\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.550\nThat's gonna help us to do this.\n\n22\n00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.540\nSo, let me go ahead and show you a\ndiagram, and make sure that we understand,\n\n23\n00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.440\nand review a little bit of what we\nactually did the other day here, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.290\nAll right, so, what we've done in\nthe past, here, is we went ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.070\nsynchronized our active directory, which\nallows us to be able to send information\n\n26\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.000\nfrom our on-premises active\ndirectory up in Office 365.\n\n27\n00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.320\nAnd what that will eventually do is\ngive us the ability to have the same\n\n28\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.690\nsign in for our username and our password,\nregardless of whether we're actually\n\n29\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.920\nonline, going to Office 365,\nor on premises.\n\n30\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.540\nAnd that's technically\ncalled same sign in, right?\n\n31\n00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.170\nIt's still actually\nentering it in both places.\n\n32\n00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.340\nBut at that point here,\n\n33\n00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.954\nmost people would probably still\nconsider that single sign-on.\n\n34\n00:01:45.954 --> 00:01:49.960\nTrue single sign-on, though,\nis when I log in to my network, and\n\n35\n00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.475\nI really don't have to log in again to\nget access to something like Office 365.\n\n36\n00:01:54.475 --> 00:01:56.565\nNow there's a caveat there, right?\n\n37\n00:01:56.565 --> 00:01:58.335\nIf you go to the web portal, of course,\n\n38\n00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:01.465\nyou're actually gonna end\nup having to sign in again.\n\n39\n00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:03.205\nBut what we're really trying to do, right,\n\n40\n00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:07.765\nis, in this situation,\nI've got my Office 365 account.\n\n41\n00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:09.655\nNow, let me use Daniel instead.\n\n42\n00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:12.035\nDaniel's got his Office 365 account.\n\n43\n00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:14.075\nHe went in, and\nhe's downloaded the office suite.\n\n44\n00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:17.970\nAnd he's connected in, let's say,\nMicrosoft Office Outlook, right?\n\n45\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.590\nRight.\n\n46\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.680\nHe goes and signs in and get's his email.\n\n47\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.640\nWell in theory what would happen\nwith same sign on is this, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.520\nHe logs in to is regular workstation\ncomputer using his domain credentials,\n\n49\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.810\nhe opens up the Outlook,\n\n50\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.990\nhe still has to sign in again before\nhe can retrieve his email email.\n\n51\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.420\nSo what we wanna do is\nwe want to prevent that.\n\n52\n00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.235\nWhat we need to do, is to be able to make\nsure that when we have something like\n\n53\n00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:41.880\nthis, he's just signing on one time.\n\n54\n00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.830\nHe launches Outlook and\nhe doesn't have to sign in on again.\n\n55\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.200\nSo it's automatically signing him on,\nand he doesn't have to worry about it.\n\n56\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.760\nAnd that's what we actually\nended up setting up, right?\n\n57\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.920\nSo we took the time and what we were\nreally doing in our previous steps.\n\n58\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.410\nIs focusing in on this one server,\nwhere we set up what we call the ADFS,\n\n59\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.610\ncalled the Active Directory\nFederation Server.\n\n60\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.560\nAnd what that active directory federation\nserver gives us the ability to do is,\n\n61\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.374\nit actually allows us to be able to\nauthenticate against our on-premises\n\n62\n00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:13.526\nactive directory.\n\n63\n00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:18.210\nAnd then we he,\nwhen Daniel opens up Office or Outlook.\n\n64\n00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.590\n>> Outlook, what it'll do it\nwill send over a security token.\n\n65\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.910\nIt will also have his claim that\nsays yes he can check his email.\n\n66\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.710\nYes, he can do all this stuff, and\n\n67\n00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.180\nthen send that back without\nhim having to sign in again.\n\n68\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.170\nSo that is the process that we\nwere setting up that last time.\n\n69\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.180\nNow, when we start setting that up, right?\n\n70\n00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.500\nInternally on your network\nthat's what will also happen.\n\n71\n00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.170\nAnd there's also another process\nthat we'll be getting to in a later\n\n72\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.560\nepisode as well,\n\n73\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.310\nwhere we might actually want to be able\nto do this from outside of our network.\n\n74\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.480\nWe have a travelling sales force, we have\na team that actually works off site.\n\n75\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.630\nBut when they log into Office 365,\n\n76\n00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.610\nit will automatically redirect\nthem to that ADFS server instead.\n\n77\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.110\nAnd when that ends up happening, they'll\nend up getting that same experience,\n\n78\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.910\nregardless whether they're actually on\ndevices that are not inside a network, or\n\n79\n00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.240\nwhether I actually own devices\ninside of my network as well.\n\n80\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.480\nSo, that's what we were doing that final,\n\n81\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.240\nthat time that we're actually\nsetting everything up.\n\n82\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.625\nAnd so what we were, once we actually had\ndone that, right, we need to go ahead and\n\n83\n00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.965\nverify, and\nthe problem is we ran outta time.\n\n84\n00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:23.875\nSo that's what we're actually\ndoing in today's episode,\n\n85\n00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:28.755\nis verifying that all the things that we\nhad actually set up, did work out here.\n\n86\n00:04:28.755 --> 00:04:32.705\nAnd I wanna point out a few other things\nthat we may also need to consider as well,\n\n87\n00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.225\nduring the installation as well, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:37.495\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n89\n00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:41.325\nSo what I had of course,\nis I have my federation server,\n\n90\n00:04:41.325 --> 00:04:45.340\nthis FS01 server Here is\nthat federation server.\n\n91\n00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.870\nAnd this is the one where we install\nthe active federation services role\n\n92\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.670\non this particular machine.\n\n93\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.210\nAnd remember that when we do this,\n\n94\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.450\nthis requires us to have a third party\ncertificate that we would go out,\n\n95\n00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.420\nand we would purchase, and we'd download,\nand install onto this server.\n\n96\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.980\nBecause that's a part of that\nprocess of getting that STS,\n\n97\n00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.860\nthat Security Token Service working.\n\n98\n00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.690\nBecause Office 365 has to trust\na third-party Security Token Service, and\n\n99\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.880\nnot a security authority that I generated,\n\n100\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.350\nthat's why you actually\nneed that service running.\n\n101\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.180\nSo without that, right,\nwithout that third-party certificate,\n\n102\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.730\nnone of this will end up Working.\n\n103\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.340\nOkay.\n\n104\n00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.260\nThe other thing that we also said that\nwe need to be actually be working here,\n\n105\n00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.150\nwas that we need a service account.\n\n106\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.810\nRight?\n\n107\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.950\nA service account is, of course,\nthat account that allows us to be able to,\n\n108\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.969\nwhen we set up the federation service,\nwe can use those credentials.\n\n109\n00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.020\nSo that those credentials will not expire,\nright?\n\n110\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.420\nThey won't time out, thereby messing\nup the service at one point or another.\n\n111\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:53.060\nSo we created that manage service counter,\nor service account again.\n\n112\n00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.200\nSo once we had that done,\nwe had those two pieces.\n\n113\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.560\nThere is a piece of information\nI did want to mention,\n\n114\n00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.250\nthat is very important as well,\n\n115\n00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.610\nbecause more than likely I might have\nforgotten it during the installation too.\n\n116\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.530\nWe need to setup what we call an SPN.\n\n117\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.410\nAnd if you have this set up, what will end\nup happening, is that you'll see as you\n\n118\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.310\ngo through those steps and if you go,\nwow he keeps talking about these steps.\n\n119\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.000\nWe're gonna watch the show where we\nactually went through these steps,\n\n120\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.740\nwe're not gonna actually walk\nthrough all those steps again here.\n\n121\n00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.360\nBut when you actually go through it,\nyou'll get errors that will tell you\n\n122\n00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.330\nsomething like SPN has not been setup and\nstuff like that.\n\n123\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.430\nBut there are some commands in\nthere that you can go back in and\n\n124\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.195\nactually setup whatever that SPN\nservice name is actually going to be.\n\n125\n00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:37.835\nAnd so let me go and show you at least\nsome of those basic commands here,\n\n126\n00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:41.865\nthat you want to get set up as we do this.\n\n127\n00:06:41.865 --> 00:06:47.165\nLet me change out that font size just\na little bit, so that we can see this\n\n128\n00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:52.390\neasier, and let me do that and\nchange the color of that text,\n\n129\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.500\nand then we can see it a little\nbit easier as well, too.\n\n130\n00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.070\nSo, what you do is you type in setspn for\nthat service principle name,\n\n131\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.650\nand then do a -a.\n\n132\n00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.830\nAt this point you type in Host/ and\n\n133\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.550\nthen whatever that service name\nis going to be for the server.\n\n134\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.540\nSo I did something like this.\n\n135\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.755\nWhat I did, and\nthen I added in my service account.\n\n136\n00:07:18.755 --> 00:07:21.930\nAdfs-service is what I call it.\n\n137\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.150\nNow I can run it again, but\nit's actually gonna tell me something.\n\n138\n00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.720\nLike Ron, you already did this.\n\n139\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.130\nNotice it says, duplicate SPN found,\naborting operation.\n\n140\n00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.950\nSo that is something you definitely wanna\nmake sure that you do get set in there to,\n\n141\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.430\nyou know, to verify.\n\n142\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.780\nIf not, during that ADFS installation,\nit may tell you,\n\n143\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.580\nyou need to set this up before, and it'll\nmake you stop the process and set it up.\n\n144\n00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.780\nSo you at least have that.\n\n145\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.348\nAnd so, you know, just make sure\nyou get that set up in there and\n\n146\n00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:50.307\nthat might ha've been something like\nI said, now that I think about it,\n\n147\n00:07:50.307 --> 00:07:53.340\nI may not have mentioned even though I\ndid it, I don't know how I did that.\n\n148\n00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.764\nBut you know, it's one of those things\nwhere it ended up happening there.\n\n149\n00:07:56.764 --> 00:07:58.747\nBut you do need to set that up, okay.\n\n150\n00:07:58.747 --> 00:08:01.299\nAnd make sure that all of\nthat is actually setup, and\n\n151\n00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:03.566\nthen we continue to walk\nthrough the process.\n\n152\n00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:07.664\nAt one point it asked me, of course,\nfor that certificate, and where I was\n\n153\n00:08:07.664 --> 00:08:12.360\nactually gonna be able to install and\ndo everything else that we needed to.\n\n154\n00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.230\nSo once that was set up and done,\nat that point we needed to go back in and\n\n155\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.240\nconfigure the manager to do\neverything else it needed, and\n\n156\n00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.160\nthe end result is this.\n\n157\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.280\nRight here is what you're looking for.\n\n158\n00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.300\nSo if you can open this console up and\neverything is actually running here,\n\n159\n00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.600\nthis is what you're looking for here, and\nreally it's under the Trust Relationships.\n\n160\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.450\nSo when you first start off, the only\ntrust relationship you'll end up having\n\n161\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.000\nis the device registration\nservice right here.\n\n162\n00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.260\nAnd so once that's all set up, well,\n\n163\n00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.550\nthat's actually the one\nthat's set up by default.\n\n164\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.143\nWhen the federation services finishes,\nit will add in the Microsoft Office 365,\n\n165\n00:08:52.143 --> 00:08:55.334\nverifying that when somebody\nhit this federation server,\n\n166\n00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:59.510\nautomatically give it the ability to\ndo that STS right over to Office 365.\n\n167\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.049\nAnd if you are having, of course, people\nthat are coming in from the outside,\n\n168\n00:09:03.049 --> 00:09:05.510\nyou want to set one up for\ninternal as well.\n\n169\n00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.480\nSo you do make sure that you\ncheck those things out too.\n\n170\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.880\nThe only other thing that you want to\nverify here is everything that's set up is\n\n171\n00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.154\nunder certificates.\n\n172\n00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:20.500\nThe third-party certificate is\npretty much the key at this point.\n\n173\n00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.590\nBy default, if you do not have that,\n\n174\n00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.460\nof course, the server itself will\ngenerate a self-signing certificate.\n\n175\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.150\nBut what you can do is\nyou can come in here and\n\n176\n00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.710\nadd in your own third-party certificate.\n\n177\n00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.010\nAnd when you do so, you want to make\nsure you mark it as being primary,\n\n178\n00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.050\nand it's fairly simple.\n\n179\n00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.890\nYou see a little Primary over here.\n\n180\n00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.400\nYou select it and you mark it,\nthen you can do that.\n\n181\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.120\nNow it's not easy, right?\n\n182\n00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.990\nSo by default,\nwhat also has to happen here\n\n183\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.481\nis that if you don't have one in there and\nit actually has generated its own,\n\n184\n00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:56.140\nyou'll need to click on this Add Token\nSigning and Add Token Decrypting as well.\n\n185\n00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.998\nAnd once you do that, you may see where\nit will give you a little warning,\n\n186\n00:09:59.998 --> 00:10:02.430\nsays you can't do this by default.\n\n187\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.000\nYou have to actually turn something off,\nwhich is the automatic rollover,\n\n188\n00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.830\nis what you have to turn off, but\n\n189\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.250\nit gives you gives you the exact\ncommand in that warning.\n\n190\n00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:17.158\nSo I wouldn't worry about for the exam so\nmuch, but overall, though, it's something.\n\n191\n00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:20.642\nIf you see where it's a self-signed\ncertificate like this one,\n\n192\n00:10:20.642 --> 00:10:23.300\nwhere I know that that's\nactually not from me, or\n\n193\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.230\nmy third-party certificate, I add in my\nother ones here and I set them as primary.\n\n194\n00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.670\nSo that's the only thing that we\nneed to do on that ADFS server.\n\n195\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.850\nSo that was pretty much\nthe setup at that point.\n\n196\n00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:40.530\nThe other part that we also ended up\ndoing, then, was to make sure that we ran\n\n197\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:45.010\nthe configurations that would get us then\nattached not only to that server, but\n\n198\n00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.800\nthen also, of course,\nup to Office 365 to convert\n\n199\n00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.936\nall those accounts to being\na federated account instead.\n\n200\n00:10:52.936 --> 00:10:55.358\nAnd so we had set all that up\nin the last command that we ran,\n\n201\n00:10:55.358 --> 00:10:56.703\nand that's where we are today.\n\n202\n00:10:56.703 --> 00:11:00.652\nAnd you're probably saying, Ronnie, that\ntook a long time, but it's a great review\n\n203\n00:11:00.652 --> 00:11:04.370\nfor us, cuz sometimes this stuff slips\neven between a couple of episodes.\n\n204\n00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.930\nEven if you just watched that previous\nepisode, you still kinda go, wow,\n\n205\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.180\nman, yeah, I didn't remember\nseeing some of that stuff.\n\n206\n00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.610\nBut it is here.\n\n207\n00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:17.300\nSo now we need to actually go back in and\nconnect up to the Office Online.\n\n208\n00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:24.600\nSo inside of my Azure Active\nDirectory Module for PowerShell,\n\n209\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.710\nI'm going to connect to the service here,\nand then I'm gonna enter in credentials.\n\n210\n00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:35.390\nNow this is actually kind of a key for\nus, before we federate.\n\n211\n00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.812\nThis is where if you actually go back and\nyou see that episode,\n\n212\n00:11:37.812 --> 00:11:39.264\nI made a mistake here the first time.\n\n213\n00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:43.020\nWhen I started typing in commands, after\na while it says, hey, you can't do this.\n\n214\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.811\nAnd it's because I had entered in the\ncommand that was part of that domain that\n\n215\n00:11:46.811 --> 00:11:47.930\nI wanted to federate.\n\n216\n00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.655\nSo what I needed to do was\ngo into my Office 365,\n\n217\n00:11:51.655 --> 00:11:56.095\ncreate a global administrator\naccount that's not gonna be\n\n218\n00:11:56.095 --> 00:12:01.020\nassociated with my Office 365,\nor at least that domain.\n\n219\n00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.946\nSo I went ahead and did that.\n\n220\n00:12:03.946 --> 00:12:12.525\nAnd then I have to do my\nitprotvdemo.onmicrosoft.com,\n\n221\n00:12:12.525 --> 00:12:19.710\nand I made that account\na global administrator.\n\n222\n00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:25.450\nAnd then I have to enter in my super\nsecret password here and click OK.\n\n223\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.210\nSo this allows me to make\nchanges to the tenant\n\n224\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:32.520\nof Office 365 that I\nhave under ITProTV demo.\n\n225\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.020\nAnd in a moment,\nonce everything actually connects in,\n\n226\n00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:40.330\nnow I'm a global administrator and I can\nrun remote commands up into Office 365.\n\n227\n00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.391\nSo that's pretty much what we want.\n\n228\n00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:46.082\nNow I can actually run a get-msoldomain,\nand\n\n229\n00:12:46.082 --> 00:12:51.960\nthis is how you can actually tell if\neverything's been set up correctly.\n\n230\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.110\nSo notice that these three names here,\n\n231\n00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.690\nthese are the names that\nare associated with my ITProTV demo.\n\n232\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:05.097\nitprotvdemo.mail.onmicrosoft.com,\nonmicrosoft.com,\n\n233\n00:13:05.097 --> 00:13:08.580\nand just my own domain there.\n\n234\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.350\nWell, remember that that second\none is the default domain\n\n235\n00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.340\naccount when you set\nup your trial account.\n\n236\n00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.930\nThe other one, of course, is as you set\nup your email, it also has another name.\n\n237\n00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.930\nAnd notice this one, the primary one,\nwhich is itprotvdemo, and\n\n238\n00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.590\nwhat it says over here is federated.\n\n239\n00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.000\nSo that is one of the ways\nthat you can verify right away\n\n240\n00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.810\nthat you have your federation services\nset up the way that you need to.\n\n241\n00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:39.771\nThe other primary way to do this is\nimmediately after running the actual\n\n242\n00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:45.553\nsetup commands that we actually ran\nin the episode, you can go back and\n\n243\n00:13:45.553 --> 00:13:51.646\ncheck those out here, is we also\nwant to Get-MsolFederationProperty.\n\n244\n00:13:51.646 --> 00:13:56.471\nAnd then I can do a -DomainName\n\n245\n00:13:56.471 --> 00:14:02.520\nitprotv.com, and I can hit Enter.\n\n246\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.417\nAnd this is probably where\nwe did leave off on this.\n\n247\n00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:07.464\nSee, it doesn't like it,\n\n248\n00:14:07.464 --> 00:14:12.630\ncuz I should use my correct one instead\nof the demo account that I had.\n\n249\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.170\nI was like, that's not good.\n\n250\n00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.980\nThat would be really bad.\n\n251\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.820\nSo now in the end here,\nit gave me a lot of information.\n\n252\n00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.860\nAnd what it is is two sets of information.\n\n253\n00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.150\nThe first set is where it\npulled some information from\n\n254\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.270\nthe Active Directory Federated Server.\n\n255\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.670\nSo that's what it did there.\n\n256\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.930\nAnd then if I scroll down\na little bit further on,\n\n257\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.720\nyou can see that here's another\nsource of information too.\n\n258\n00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.840\nNow the key behind this, and realizing and\nwhat we're validating in terms of\n\n259\n00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.470\nfederated services here,\nis what we're looking for\n\n260\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:55.387\nunder FederationServiceIdentifier,\nright here, and this line right here.\n\n261\n00:14:55.387 --> 00:15:00.204\nRemember that if Office 365 by itself is\nnot federated, it's gonna point to where?\n\n262\n00:15:00.204 --> 00:15:06.018\nPortal.office.com or\nlogin.microsoftonline.com\n\n263\n00:15:06.018 --> 00:15:12.210\nto give you access into Office 365 online,\nmakes sense.\n\n264\n00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:18.810\nIf I set up my own, right over here,\nmy FederationServiceIdentifier,\n\n265\n00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.100\nthat of course would be set up\nthe way that I would set it up.\n\n266\n00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.900\nSo it showed two different things\nas what we would normally show.\n\n267\n00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.980\nNow would it show up at all if I\nactually didn't have it federated?\n\n268\n00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.340\nNo, it wouldn't.\n\n269\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.970\nBut can it still show up\ntwo different things?\n\n270\n00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.780\nIt can, but it's not likely.\n\n271\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.530\nAt the very end,\nwhen you end up seeing everything run, and\n\n272\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.940\neverything done here, what you should\nsee of course is in the end here,\n\n273\n00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.850\nis that everything did update\nsuccessfully, the first time you run it.\n\n274\n00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.452\nNow I've run this several times,\nso it doesn't say that again.\n\n275\n00:15:51.452 --> 00:15:52.635\nBut if it doesn't,\n\n276\n00:15:52.635 --> 00:15:57.301\nif those two things do not match in terms\nof the FederationServiceIdentifier,\n\n277\n00:15:57.301 --> 00:16:00.865\nthis information over here,\nit should match identically.\n\n278\n00:16:00.865 --> 00:16:05.750\nWith what we saw down here under\nthe FederationServiceIdentifier.\n\n279\n00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.200\nThat's another verification that what?\n\n280\n00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.840\nThat they're on the same page.\n\n281\n00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.530\nOkay.\n\n282\n00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.750\nOffice Online is on the same page as your\nActive Directory FederationService, so\n\n283\n00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.520\nthey all agree that they're\ngonna lead you to what?\n\n284\n00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.570\nTo one place.\n\n285\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.960\nOkay, so that's another way\nthat we can actually identify\n\n286\n00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.192\nhow this is actually going to be working.\n\n287\n00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:25.830\nAll right, so this is a great question for\n\n288\n00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.630\nus and what if those two\ndon't end up matching, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.120\nWell, there's a command we can run here if\nthey do not match that will normally get\n\n290\n00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.580\nthem to match up, and\nof course this is what we call update-,\n\n291\n00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.285\nlet me make sure I actually\ntype it in correctly here.\n\n292\n00:16:40.285 --> 00:16:47.600\nMsolFederatedDomain, and\nthen I do my domain name.\n\n293\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.410\nAnd of course, itprotvdemo.com,\nand what it will do is it\n\n294\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:56.330\nwill run through that process again and\nverify that they do match up.\n\n295\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.860\nAnd in the end here, you should see that\nsame line the first time that we ran,\n\n296\n00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.940\nthat ability to match them up here,\nis that they're successfully updated and\n\n297\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.990\nthen you would run that same command\nagain that we had on the properties, and\n\n298\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:15.020\nthat point the FederationServiceIdentifier\n\n299\n00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.542\nshould actually be the same, at that\npoint, and they normally are going to be.\n\n300\n00:17:18.542 --> 00:17:22.260\nSo usually if it doesn't\ndo it like that first time,\n\n301\n00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.280\nwhen you actually update it,\nit's probably not gonna do it,\n\n302\n00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.460\nwhich means you need to go back and\ncheck your federation services,\n\n303\n00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.080\nverify that everything is set\nup the way that it needs to be.\n\n304\n00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.340\nSo those are some of the verifications,\n\n305\n00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:38.006\nright, that tell you in the background\nthat Office 365, and, of course,\n\n306\n00:17:38.006 --> 00:17:42.290\nyour on-premises Active Directory,\nthat it's ready for single sign-on.\n\n307\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.350\nBut, there's more, of course.\n\n308\n00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.610\nOkay so.\n>> Wait there's more.\n\n309\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:46.470\n>> There's always more.\n\n310\n00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.540\n>> If you act now.\n\n311\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.622\n>> Ginsu knife sets.\n\n312\n00:17:48.622 --> 00:17:50.790\n>> That's right.\n>> Which is what we can actually go to.\n\n313\n00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.080\nWe're not going to go\nto a ginsu knife set.\n\n314\n00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.580\nWe're gonna go to our Office online.\n\n315\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.200\nNow, when we start doing this, right, I'm\ngonna use another account for right now,\n\n316\n00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.320\nwhich is actually that\nadministrator account that I had.\n\n317\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.810\n>> Now, why are you gonna use\nthe administrator account instead of your\n\n318\n00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:07.680\npersonal account?\n\n319\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.390\n>> Now, the reason why I need to,\nand I'll show you this right here.\n\n320\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.090\nLet me finish typing this in,\nand then I can talk about it.\n\n321\n00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.800\n>> At least it's a short user-\n>> Well,\n\n322\n00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.210\nyou know that me typing\nis challenging enough.\n\n323\n00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.540\nTyping and talking,\nyou might as well just end the show.\n\n324\n00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.120\nBut this is why we need to use this,\nright?\n\n325\n00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.080\nRight now, if federation services\nare verified and working,\n\n326\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.690\nwhat should happen on the page right here,\nlet me go and see that page again.\n\n327\n00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.170\nOn the page right here, as soon as I\nfinish typing in the user name that I\n\n328\n00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.126\nwould normally use,\nronald@itprotvdemo.com,\n\n329\n00:18:39.126 --> 00:18:44.745\nit's gonna automatically redirect\nme over to my federation server.\n\n330\n00:18:44.745 --> 00:18:47.335\nWhich is fine, except for\nthe fact that it means I can't\n\n331\n00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:50.835\nshow you some of the things I need\nto show you before it happens.\n\n332\n00:18:50.835 --> 00:18:55.415\nSo, by doing this, it will stop that\nprocess, and I can click there.\n\n333\n00:18:55.415 --> 00:18:58.862\nAnd so, it actually went out and\nit talked to Office online and said, hey,\n\n334\n00:18:58.862 --> 00:19:00.690\nwho's associated with this account?\n\n335\n00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:05.234\nIf it only saw IT Pro TV,\nit would automatically redirect me here.\n\n336\n00:19:05.234 --> 00:19:07.126\nSo what I want is this, and\n\n337\n00:19:07.126 --> 00:19:12.510\nthen I need to enter in that super\nsecret password, and get signed in.\n\n338\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.220\nRemember that this is a global\nadministrator account, and\n\n339\n00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.330\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nverify in one particular location,\n\n340\n00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.760\nthis is a great one for you to remember.\n\n341\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.070\nWell, for anything, at least for\nanything for the exam.\n\n342\n00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.620\nCuz they always love doing this\nkind of stuff on the exam.\n\n343\n00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.510\nWhere do you go to Office\nto be able to verify this?\n\n344\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.710\nSo I'm going to click on that\nlittle Options button, and\n\n345\n00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:39.630\nthen select the Admin console to bring\nme into Office 365 Admin console.\n\n346\n00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:44.820\nI'm going to scroll down to Domains,\nand inside of Domains,\n\n347\n00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:49.270\nwhat we're looking for is this link right\nhere, where it says Domain settings.\n\n348\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.690\nI select that link, it will actually\nkind of have this right here,\n\n349\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:58.191\nwhere at the very top,\nit says DNS management,\n\n350\n00:19:58.191 --> 00:20:01.330\nSingle sign-on.\n\n351\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.220\nThis domain is configured for\nsingle sign-on.\n\n352\n00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.200\nIt really doesn't get any more\nclearer than this that, hey,\n\n353\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.160\nthis domain is actually ready and\nset up for\n\n354\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.970\nsingle sign-on at this particular point,\nand we should be ready to go, okay?\n\n355\n00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.730\nSo you do wanna make sure that\nthat's actually something that you\n\n356\n00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.550\ncan verify as well.\n\n357\n00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.082\nIf you try and do it with a regular domain\naccount and everything's not set up yet,\n\n358\n00:20:23.082 --> 00:20:26.500\nyou're gonna say, hey, how the heck\ndo I get access back to Office 365?\n\n359\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.820\nYou need to use that special\naccount that we talked about\n\n360\n00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.000\nthat's not really a part of the domain to\nmake sure it's a global administrator.\n\n361\n00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.510\nSo let's go ahead and verify.\n\n362\n00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.550\nAnd what I have, of course, here it is.\n\n363\n00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.030\nHere's my Windows 10 machine instead.\n\n364\n00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.670\nSo I'm on a client computer on my network.\n\n365\n00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.314\nAnd, let's see if we can log in here,\nokay?\n\n366\n00:20:44.314 --> 00:20:49.213\nSo, remember that if I had\nOffice Suite on here, I shouldn't,\n\n367\n00:20:49.213 --> 00:20:52.771\nat this point,\nactually need to log in again.\n\n368\n00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:56.011\nBut I wanna just test it\nby going right here, and\n\n369\n00:20:56.011 --> 00:21:02.510\nverify that my federation services is\nactually set up the way that I want, okay?\n\n370\n00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.000\nSo, here it is.\n\n371\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.220\nI'm actually at the login, and\nnotice it already has my name here.\n\n372\n00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.000\nSo let me see if I can get it\nto forget it for right now.\n\n373\n00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.450\nAnd so now here it is.\n\n374\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.280\nSo, here it is,\nwe're at the Office portal.\n\n375\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.414\nAnd I do ronnie@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n376\n00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:24.220\nAnd as soon as I tab out of that,\nnotice it says it's redirecting me here.\n\n377\n00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:28.640\nAnd it's redirecting me and now it's\ngoing to my federation server, and\n\n378\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.350\nI can tell up here in the address\nbar it says FS01itprotvdemo.com.\n\n379\n00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.170\nSo, it's going up there and\nit's looking for that server.\n\n380\n00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.635\nNow, the way that my machine is, right,\n\n381\n00:21:38.635 --> 00:21:42.070\nit actually is having a certificate issue,\nokay.\n\n382\n00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.030\nBut it's going to because\ninternal in my network instead.\n\n383\n00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.760\nAnd it's not reaching out to that\ncertificate server right now.\n\n384\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.640\nBut if I go ahead and\n\n385\n00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:54.060\nclick Continue, notice that it actually\nalready has my name typed in there.\n\n386\n00:21:54.060 --> 00:22:00.210\nAnd at this point, I didn't actually have\nto present my username on the other page.\n\n387\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.400\nAnd so, as long as I typed in my username\nand password correctly, here we go.\n\n388\n00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:09.400\nOkay, so now I'm logged into Office 365,\nbut remember the process here.\n\n389\n00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.050\nSo what that meant is that from inside\nof my network I was on a laptop, and\n\n390\n00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.910\nwhen I first logged in I\ntried to go to Office 365,\n\n391\n00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:22.910\nI typed in my username,\nit associated me with, well, my domain,\n\n392\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:28.070\nand it automatically made me come here to\nthe active directory federation services.\n\n393\n00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.980\nAnd from that point, it authenticated\nme against my active directory domain.\n\n394\n00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:38.150\nBut then, it allowed me to connect\nback into Office 365 online.\n\n395\n00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.620\nSo I only really entered in my\npassword one time at that point, but\n\n396\n00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.150\nremember that if I had\ndownloaded the Office Suite and\n\n397\n00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.040\nI had Outlook installed,\nwhen I check-in for email, in theory,\n\n398\n00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.680\nif I don't have this set up, it should\nask me to re-present my credentials.\n\n399\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.640\nIn this way, it shouldn't ask me to\nre-present the credentials or anything.\n\n400\n00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.500\nRonnie, why didn't you do that?\n\n401\n00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.110\nWell, I'm using a trial account,\n\n402\n00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:01.450\nI don't really want to install the Office\nSuite for a trial account to do that.\n\n403\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.570\nBut you kind of see where this\nis really helpful for you.\n\n404\n00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.100\nIt really doesn't annoy people to have to\nenter in their password a couple of times.\n\n405\n00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.160\nBut at the same time,\n\n406\n00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.330\nthis is one less step that they\nwould be need to be able to do.\n\n407\n00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.580\nSo this is actually just\ngetting it set up and\n\n408\n00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.920\nmaking sure that\nthe Federation Services are working.\n\n409\n00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.610\nNow, once the Federation Services\nis working,\n\n410\n00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:25.780\nthat means that anybody from\ninside of my network can do that,\n\n411\n00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.650\nand it's perfectly fine and\nwe would be ready to do that.\n\n412\n00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:33.865\nBut what if, though,\nlet me go back here and let me bring up a.\n\n413\n00:23:33.865 --> 00:23:35.260\nNow, here it is.\n\n414\n00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.290\nI'm actually on my own laptop.\n\n415\n00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:41.230\nNot part of that internal\nITProTV demo network.\n\n416\n00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.490\nIf I do a login from here.\n\n417\n00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.540\nAnd let's say I select that same account.\n\n418\n00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.320\nNotice what it's doing\neven from the outside.\n\n419\n00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.480\nIt's trying to redirect me\nto the federation server.\n\n420\n00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.610\nThe problem that I have is simple is that\nthat network is not really connected\n\n421\n00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:57.410\noutside.\n\n422\n00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.810\nThere's no DNS record associated with it.\n\n423\n00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:00.790\nIt doesn't know where to go.\n\n424\n00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.200\nIt's gonna continue to try.\n\n425\n00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.660\nIt's gonna end up eventually failing\nbecause it doesn't know what to do.\n\n426\n00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.760\nSo the next step for us, of course then,\nis how do we get that connected?\n\n427\n00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.960\nAnd that's where we're gonna end\nup setting up a proxy server\n\n428\n00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.500\nthat will be attached to\nthe outside on my network.\n\n429\n00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.200\nAnd so\nwhat does this give us the ability to do?\n\n430\n00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.470\nWhether inside the network or outside\nthe network, we can have it set up for\n\n431\n00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.090\nsingle sign on.\n\n432\n00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.650\nBut because of that, Daniel, and\nbecause you let me talk again too long,\n\n433\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:30.840\nit means we're gonna end up doing this in\nanother complete episode, but there it is.\n\n434\n00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.760\nThe verification and the set up of\nactive directory federation services for\n\n435\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.600\ngetting single sign on working.\n\n436\n00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.370\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n437\n00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:42.090\nObviously, single sign on is a very nice\nfeature that we can use for our benefit.\n\n438\n00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.820\nI don't have to remember a bunch\nof usernames and passwords.\n\n439\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.750\nI've got one username, I got one password.\n\n440\n00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.850\nAllows me access to all my resources.\n\n441\n00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.720\nIt is the way to go,\nit's the creme de la creme.\n\n442\n00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.545\nYou do need to be a little more\ncareful with your passwords,\n\n443\n00:24:55.545 --> 00:24:59.630\ncuz remember with a single sign on,\nwell, if I get you username and\n\n444\n00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.460\npassword I've got the keys to\neverything you have access to.\n\n445\n00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.530\nSo, just make sure you do have that\nlittle security measure, have good,\n\n446\n00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.090\nstrong passwords and don't share them out.\n\n447\n00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.010\nRonnie, is there anything else we need\nto know about single sign on our using\n\n448\n00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.670\nfederated services?\n\n449\n00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.180\n>> Well, I really think you\nmade a great point there,\n\n450\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.640\nin terms of security, and so a lot of\ntimes, remember that the best practice,\n\n451\n00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.440\nof course, is not just to use\na username and password, but\n\n452\n00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.530\nmaybe to do the idea of the multi-factor\nauthentication instead.\n\n453\n00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.180\nRemember that can also be set up that you\ncan use it with single sign on as well.\n\n454\n00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.040\nBut for us, though, just at least getting\nthose services running is actually\n\n455\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.470\nis a great big deal for us,\nbecause it is a little bit complicated,\n\n456\n00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.400\nthere's a lot of little pieces to it.\n\n457\n00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.040\nBut once those pieces do fit into place,\nyou see it work fairly fine.\n\n458\n00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.240\nEven in my lab environment,\nI was kind of throwing together here,\n\n459\n00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.195\nI say thrown together,\nit took me a little bit of time.\n\n460\n00:25:45.195 --> 00:25:49.590\nBut even in that environment, right,\nwithout actually a public IP address,\n\n461\n00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.230\nwe can still get access in,\nonly from internally in the network.\n\n462\n00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.940\nBut we did show you the process and\nthat it's done there.\n\n463\n00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.050\nBut just remember that\nthat's really the next and\n\n464\n00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.770\nfinal step is that we choose\nto set up our proxy server.\n\n465\n00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.260\nSo we'll see that in another episode.\n\n466\n00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.420\n>> Well, I look forward to it Ronnie.\n\n467\n00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.280\nWe thank you so much for\n\n468\n00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.270\njoining us today and\nshowing us how to tackle this here bear.\n\n469\n00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.990\nBecause like Ronnie said, it is a little\ncomplex, it is gonna take some work, but\n\n470\n00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.970\nit's well worth the effort\nonce you get it down.\n\n471\n00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.500\nSo check this episode out.\n\n472\n00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.040\nCheck the previous episode out.\n\n473\n00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.320\nSo learn how to get this up and\nrunning for yourself.\n\n474\n00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.540\nAgain, as far as that goes,\nI guess we're done for this episode.\n\n475\n00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.530\nAgain, Ronnie, thank you.\n\n476\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.170\nAnd thank you guys for watching.\n\n477\n00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.240\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n478\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.710\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowry.\n\n479\n00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:28.270\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n480\n00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.522\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n481\n00:26:31.522 --> 00:26:34.981\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.213\nI am your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:19.756\nToday, we are doing our\nOffice 365 content.\n\n5\n00:00:19.756 --> 00:00:24.530\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at installing and\n\n6\n00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.713\nSSO proxy server.\n\n7\n00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:30.015\nNow on previous episodes, Ronnie has\nshown us how to setup that single sign\n\n8\n00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:32.011\non internally for our land users.\n\n9\n00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:36.538\nBut we know that in today's enterprise,\nit's very common to have people\n\n10\n00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:40.713\ntelecommuting or going to remote\nlocations, hotels, airports.\n\n11\n00:00:40.713 --> 00:00:44.749\nAnd still needing that access and we want\nto try to provide that single sign on for\n\n12\n00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.921\nthem as well, so they don't have to enter\nthose credentials over and over again.\n\n13\n00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:50.665\nSo Ronnie, how can we set it up, so\n\n14\n00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:54.422\nthat people outside of our LAN can get\nthat same benefit of single sign on?\n\n15\n00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:58.369\n>> That's really kind of the key here is\nthat we want to make sure that we can give\n\n16\n00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.381\nthem the connectivity that they need and\nhave that experience that they would\n\n17\n00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:06.690\nnormally have even in the same way\nthat they're inside of our network.\n\n18\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.588\nNow, it doesn't really matter.\n\n19\n00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:10.358\nIf you choose go, hey,\nI don't wanna do this at all.\n\n20\n00:01:10.358 --> 00:01:11.764\nWhat does that mean?\nThat means that if you do\n\n21\n00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:13.604\ngive them remote access to your network,\n\n22\n00:01:13.604 --> 00:01:16.560\nthey'll sign on using their domain\ncredentials perfectly fine.\n\n23\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.027\nBut then when they go to Office 365,\nthat means that they're gonna use those\n\n24\n00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:24.650\ncredentials as well to sign on\nsome where else in Office 365.\n\n25\n00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.253\nSo if you don't really care about\ndoing it, that's one thing.\n\n26\n00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:31.135\nBut most of the time, especially with\nnew people and especially with your\n\n27\n00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:34.892\norganization as it grows and grows,\nit becomes much more difficult for\n\n28\n00:01:34.892 --> 00:01:39.462\na single person to have to go, well, was I\nsupposed to use my Office 365 credentials\n\n29\n00:01:39.462 --> 00:01:43.000\nto sign on or was I supposed to use\nmy domain credentials to sign on?\n\n30\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.630\nAnd now, they also maybe have two\ndifferent passwords to be able to actually\n\n31\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.796\nconnect and\ndo everything that they want to.\n\n32\n00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:50.337\nIt becomes a little bit more complex.\n\n33\n00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:52.587\n>> Absolutely and\nyou can see where that's going.\n\n34\n00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:55.902\nThey're gonna end up locking out one\nof those accounts or the other, because\n\n35\n00:01:55.902 --> 00:01:59.217\nthey're gonna be using the wrong password\nor the wrong set of credentials and\n\n36\n00:01:59.217 --> 00:02:01.462\nthat's just going to lead\nto calls to the help desk.\n\n37\n00:02:01.462 --> 00:02:03.838\nMore work that we have to do.\n\n38\n00:02:03.838 --> 00:02:07.240\nSo we're confusing our users,\nwe're making it more difficult for them.\n\n39\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.632\nWe're generating more work on\nthe help desk side of things, so\n\n40\n00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:13.962\ndoing a single sign-on is probably\na really nice thing to do.\n\n41\n00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:18.140\n>> It really is, it helps out so much by\nproviding a unified set of credentials for\n\n42\n00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.767\nour users regardless of whether they're\nlogging into our on-premises network where\n\n43\n00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:26.756\nthey normally would have access to\nresources, but also with Office 365\n\n44\n00:02:26.756 --> 00:02:30.580\nas well implementing simple sign\non is something that we can do.\n\n45\n00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.204\nAnd just like Mike said\nin a previous episode,\n\n46\n00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:37.513\nwe already showed how we can do this by\nusing the Active Directory federation\n\n47\n00:02:37.513 --> 00:02:41.751\nservices server that it sets it up to\nnow where when somebody on the inside my\n\n48\n00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:46.197\nnetwork when they connect in to\nauthenticate their credentials, it's gonna\n\n49\n00:02:46.197 --> 00:02:50.422\ngo against their Active Directory and\nauthenticate those credentials.\n\n50\n00:02:50.422 --> 00:02:53.964\nAnd then with that same user inside\nof the network, when he goes and\n\n51\n00:02:53.964 --> 00:02:57.822\ntries to connect it to Office 365,\nthat federation server instead is\n\n52\n00:02:57.822 --> 00:03:01.379\ngonna present that security token\ninstead over to Office 365.\n\n53\n00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.189\nOffice 365 will take a look at\nthat information and say, yes,\n\n54\n00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.480\nthis is actually that same user.\n\n55\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.462\nGo ahead and get access to those\nresources out there, as well.\n\n56\n00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:13.595\nSo it does work on the inside really well,\nbut on the outside,\n\n57\n00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:15.422\nit can be a little bit more complex.\n\n58\n00:03:15.422 --> 00:03:19.042\n>> Now Ronnie, is this a whole new\ninfrastructure I've got to setup or\n\n59\n00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:22.535\ncan we leverage what we've already\nset up for that internal SSO,\n\n60\n00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:25.540\ncan we just add to that to\nextend it to that external SSO?\n\n61\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.960\n>> Well, hopefully,\nthat's exactly what you're doing.\n\n62\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.754\nCan you build a brand new and whole\ninfrastructure again, if you want to?\n\n63\n00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:33.755\nYes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.337\n>> You can.\n\n65\n00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:36.587\nDo you need to?\n\n66\n00:03:36.587 --> 00:03:39.212\nNo.\nWhat you're now doing is you're really\n\n67\n00:03:39.212 --> 00:03:42.383\nadding on another component\nto help you to do that and\n\n68\n00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:46.004\nwhat we're talking about now\nis the idea of a proxy server.\n\n69\n00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:48.978\nNow the idea of the proxy server for\nus, if we're used to this,\n\n70\n00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.129\nbecause we're on\nthe inside of our network.\n\n71\n00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.821\nWe've always heard about it as like a web\ncaching proxy more than anything else,\n\n72\n00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:58.379\nallows us to go to control access in and\nout.\n\n73\n00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.897\nAllows us to be able to cash that\ninformation on that proxy server, so that\n\n74\n00:04:01.897 --> 00:04:05.701\nwe get better speeds inside or at least\napparently better speeds on the inside,\n\n75\n00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:08.004\nbut everything goes\nthrough that one channel.\n\n76\n00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:11.408\nWell, this type of proxy\nserver that we're setting up\n\n77\n00:04:11.408 --> 00:04:14.770\nis one that's called\na web application proxy.\n\n78\n00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.907\nAnd it is actually designed to do kind of\nthe same thing where all the connections\n\n79\n00:04:18.907 --> 00:04:22.427\nthat go through will hit that proxy\nserver, but this is actually for\n\n80\n00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:24.922\nwhen you're actually on\noutside the network.\n\n81\n00:04:24.922 --> 00:04:30.305\nSo, let me show you my basic typology\nthat we are going to be using for\n\n82\n00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:32.671\nright now to help us out here.\n\n83\n00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:36.330\nSo when I take a look at this, let me\nsee if if I can zoom in just a little\n\n84\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.820\nbit more to help us out there and\nthis is what will happen.\n\n85\n00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.668\nSo notice down here at the bottom of\nthe screen is my ITProTV demo account and\n\n86\n00:04:43.668 --> 00:04:47.944\nthat's my on premises network for me right\nhere and what's really involved here is\n\n87\n00:04:47.944 --> 00:04:51.121\nthere's a client,\nthere's gonna be a domain controller and\n\n88\n00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:54.379\nthere's also my active directory\nfederation server as well.\n\n89\n00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:59.129\nSo when people try to log in at this\npoint to go to Office 365, what normally\n\n90\n00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.754\nhappens is from inside of my network,\nthey would hit a Federation server.\n\n91\n00:05:03.754 --> 00:05:07.297\nFederation server authenticates\nagainst that DC05 and\n\n92\n00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:11.052\nthen when that user says, hey,\nI need to go to Office 365,\n\n93\n00:05:11.052 --> 00:05:15.836\nbecause we already authenticated the DC\ntells the authentication services.\n\n94\n00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:17.587\nYep, that guy's authenticated.\n\n95\n00:05:17.587 --> 00:05:21.808\nThat federation server sends\nthat token out to Office 365 and\n\n96\n00:05:21.808 --> 00:05:26.886\nthen we get in, without me to actually\npresent another set of credentials and\n\n97\n00:05:26.886 --> 00:05:29.171\nthat is key for us from the inside.\n\n98\n00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:33.698\nBut on the outside of our network,\nI do not want somebody out there on\n\n99\n00:05:33.698 --> 00:05:37.921\nthe internet to essentially\nconnect into my internal domain.\n\n100\n00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.491\nSo yes, Ronnie actually needs to\nauthenticate from the outside here and\n\n101\n00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:45.527\ngets access from the outside of my network\nall the way into my domain controller and\n\n102\n00:05:45.527 --> 00:05:47.712\nthen have that authentication processed.\n\n103\n00:05:47.712 --> 00:05:52.337\nWhat we're gonna do instead is focus\nin on building a proxy server.\n\n104\n00:05:52.337 --> 00:05:55.254\nNow, this server's going\nto be in its own domain.\n\n105\n00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:58.421\nTechnically, we call it\na DMZ at this point.\n\n106\n00:05:58.421 --> 00:06:03.053\nDemilitarized zone is not going to be a\npart of the Active Directory network, but\n\n107\n00:06:03.053 --> 00:06:06.337\nit does need to be able to talk\nto this federation server.\n\n108\n00:06:06.337 --> 00:06:10.711\nAnd needs to, of course, be able to\ntake that proxy server role now and\n\n109\n00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:15.546\nsend that STS, that security token\nservice over into Office 365 as well.\n\n110\n00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:20.246\nAnd that is what we are gonna setup today\nand show you that it actually can work and\n\n111\n00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:22.560\nwe'll be using a test way to show you and\n\n112\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.462\ndemonstrate how that\nactually works in the end.\n\n113\n00:06:25.462 --> 00:06:28.713\nNow we're not completely done yet,\nbecause I might say, all right,\n\n114\n00:06:28.713 --> 00:06:29.880\nhere's a proxy server.\n\n115\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.713\nWell, what the heck do we need\nto setup this proxy server?\n\n116\n00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:36.636\nAnd there are a couple of special\nrequirements that we need to think about\n\n117\n00:06:36.636 --> 00:06:38.060\nand talk about, as well.\n\n118\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.421\nSo, I'm gonna flip on over here and\n\n119\n00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:44.379\nI have a list of some of the things\nthat we need to focus in on.\n\n120\n00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.906\nI'm gonna zoom in just a little bit more\nand make that list a little bit larger for\n\n121\n00:06:48.906 --> 00:06:50.337\nus to take a look at here.\n\n122\n00:06:50.337 --> 00:06:52.889\nNow it doesn't matter what\norder they appear in,\n\n123\n00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:55.926\nwe just need to make sure that\nwe have these things on hand.\n\n124\n00:06:55.926 --> 00:07:00.303\nIf you're gonna setup a proxy server, so\nthat your telecommuters from the outside\n\n125\n00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:04.117\nor whoever it is from the outside\ninternet network are gonna connect in,\n\n126\n00:07:04.117 --> 00:07:06.255\nyou need at least one public IP address.\n\n127\n00:07:06.255 --> 00:07:07.837\nOne will do.\n\n128\n00:07:07.837 --> 00:07:12.874\nNow of course, this is actually something\nthat I've had to realize in my lifetime\n\n129\n00:07:12.874 --> 00:07:17.330\nof doing IT work, which is I don't\nknow where to get a public IP address.\n\n130\n00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.587\nNow Mike, you and\nI have been network admins for awhile.\n\n131\n00:07:20.587 --> 00:07:23.262\nMike, have you ever said,\nI just need a public IP address for\n\n132\n00:07:23.262 --> 00:07:24.632\nwhat we're doing inside LAN?\n\n133\n00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:25.421\n>> I do not.\n\n134\n00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:29.296\nI could go to somebody in my organization\nand say, hey, do we have one available?\n\n135\n00:07:29.296 --> 00:07:30.796\nBut as far as getting one, no.\n\n136\n00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:34.504\n>> Yeah and that's the same thing,\nmaybe for you and maybe for me.\n\n137\n00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:37.258\nIf somebody in your organization says,\nhere's the requirement,\n\n138\n00:07:37.258 --> 00:07:39.160\nwe wanna set this proxy server up.\n\n139\n00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.610\nWell, the only thing you\nreally need to know is hey,\n\n140\n00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.350\nI need to make sure I can\nget a public IP address.\n\n141\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.172\nAnd if you don't know how to do it,\nI didn't know how to do it.\n\n142\n00:07:47.172 --> 00:07:51.289\nIf you don't know how to do that, that\nmeans you need to go and escalate and say,\n\n143\n00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:55.296\nwell, we need to get access to a public\nIP address that I can use for the proxy.\n\n144\n00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:58.754\nSo that's the first thing you are going\nto really need to be able to do.\n\n145\n00:07:58.754 --> 00:08:02.746\nThe second one is also something\nthat we may not have encountered,\n\n146\n00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:05.370\neven as a network admin on the inside.\n\n147\n00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.210\nEnterprise admin maybe, but\nas a network admin maybe not.\n\n148\n00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.700\nSo Mike the same thing here,\nI'm gonna ask you another question.\n\n149\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.560\nIn DNS, and Mike is a master at DNS.\n\n150\n00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.190\nI know that he is, and I know that\nhe knows how to work with this.\n\n151\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:23.160\nBut Mike, you and I, network LAN admins,\npretty much all that we have done.\n\n152\n00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.970\nAs far as actually saying, look I need to\ngo ahead and setup a public DNS record.\n\n153\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.290\nHave you ever been told,\nyes, you have to do that?\n\n154\n00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.860\n>> Once actually, and\nI had to get some help.\n\n155\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.570\nI did not, I had never.\n\n156\n00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.130\nDirectly dealt with my\npublic-facing DNS server.\n\n157\n00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.500\n>> Yeah, and most of us may not have.\n\n158\n00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.300\nOnce again, if you're not familiar with\nthat, make sure you go to whoever it is,\n\n159\n00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:52.160\nright, and escalate this and say,\nI'm also gonna need to enter in a public.\n\n160\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.320\nA record into that public side So\n\n161\n00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.790\ndon't be afraid if you're like,\nman I don't know if I can do this or not.\n\n162\n00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.300\nInside your organization\nif they're setting this up\n\n163\n00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:06.210\nthey should have the resources available,\none to help you get a public IP address.\n\n164\n00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.450\nOne if they're not gonna allow you to\naccess to that public DNS registrar,\n\n165\n00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.420\nyou submit the request and\n\n166\n00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.010\nsay here's what I need entered in to\nyour public DNS registrar as well.\n\n167\n00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.980\nSecondly you're going\nto build up a server.\n\n168\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.130\nNow I'm going to be using\nWindows Server 2012 and we're\n\n169\n00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.160\ngoing to be installing a proxy server is\nwhat we're going to be installing but\n\n170\n00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.280\nwe also need to set up\nsome networking on it.\n\n171\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.130\nSo I need to be able to modify the host\nfile on that proxy server as well and\n\n172\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.220\nthe other thing that I need It's\nsounding a little bit stranger here.\n\n173\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.220\nI need to get the public, or\n\n174\n00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.160\nthe publicly available or,\nI'm not even saying that right.\n\n175\n00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.350\nRight?\nThe third party\n\n176\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.210\ndigital certificate from my\nActive Directory Federation Server.\n\n177\n00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.110\nSo I'm gonna need to export that\nout of my Federation Server.\n\n178\n00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.970\nAnd import that into my proxy server,\nbecause we need to establish\n\n179\n00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:05.630\na secure communication between\nthe proxy server and that ADFS server,\n\n180\n00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.430\nand we need to be able to send that\nsecurely the way that we want to.\n\n181\n00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.270\nSo we're going to need to\nimport that one in, and\n\n182\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.970\nyou'll see that during the configuration\nphase, this is very important or\n\n183\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.880\nyou will actually end up failing here.\n\n184\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.920\nSo we need to make sure we can get\nthat certificate on there, okay?\n\n185\n00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.160\nIdeally, you can actually put\nthat server into the DMZ.\n\n186\n00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.840\nIf you're setting this up from\nthe outside, this would be unusual for\n\n187\n00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:33.170\nyou to choose to just build another server\ninside of your domain and go no problem.\n\n188\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.070\nI'm going to let public-\n>> Kind of defeats the purpose of\n\n189\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:36.686\na proxy, right?\n\n190\n00:10:36.686 --> 00:10:37.186\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n191\n00:10:37.186 --> 00:10:38.800\nDefeats the entire purpose\n\n192\n00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.380\nif they can get access inside of your\ninternal network right from the beginning.\n\n193\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.450\nSo we want to make sure that\nit's actually inside the DMZ.\n\n194\n00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.950\nCan you set it up that way if you want to?\n\n195\n00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:53.560\nYes, but would a network admin kind of\nsay, no, you'll never do that Should they?\n\n196\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.415\nYes, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:54.415 --> 00:10:56.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you should have that set up in that\n\n198\n00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.500\nDMZ, and\nthen of course that operational ADFS.\n\n199\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.750\nThe Active Directory Federation Services\nshould also be there as well.\n\n200\n00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.360\nSo the good thing is as you're\nleveraging the existing infrastructure,\n\n201\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.980\nin other words, if you already\nset it up where you know that\n\n202\n00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.540\ninternally on your network\nyou can get access to it.\n\n203\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.240\nWell now, what we're actually doing is\nsaying we need to setup the other part and\n\n204\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.110\nmake sure that everything is actually\nsetup the way that we need it to.\n\n205\n00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.540\nSo those are kind of the basic\nrequirements here to do this,\n\n206\n00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.910\nto get it all set up for us.\n\n207\n00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.550\nNow I do want to point out some\nterminology differences and\n\n208\n00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.440\nthis is where it gets\na little bit unusual here.\n\n209\n00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.110\nWhat ended up happening as 2012\nwas really coming on the market,\n\n210\n00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.610\nthis particular web application proxy.\n\n211\n00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.030\nI'll not be able to say that and\n\n212\n00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.840\nthen we'll-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n213\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.050\n>> This server that we're setting up here,\n\n214\n00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.140\nit didn't exist in that name.\n\n215\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.420\nIt really didn't.\n\n216\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.850\nSo before even ADFS really got on\nthe scene as far as being part of\n\n217\n00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:56.390\nWindows server 2012,\nyou had to kind of download a module.\n\n218\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.360\nIt was called ADFS 3.0 or 2.1 or whatever.\n\n219\n00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.660\nAnd then you installed that, and\n\n220\n00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.970\nthen you could also install what\nthey called the ADFS proxy.\n\n221\n00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.420\nSo, in other words, as you search on\nthe internet, you're gonna see weird\n\n222\n00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.140\nterminology out there, and you're gonna\nsee different steps for how to do this.\n\n223\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.420\nVery easy to get them confused.\n\n224\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.210\nBecause it sounds very similar.\n\n225\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.250\nIt's like yes that's identical,\nthat does represent us.\n\n226\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.780\nBut today the official terminology is\ngoing to be the web application proxy.\n\n227\n00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.970\nAnd you need to know that because as\nyou follow those older steps you're\n\n228\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.380\ngoing to see that it doesn't exist in the\nway that you want it to actually exist.\n\n229\n00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.130\nYou'll be frustrated.\n\n230\n00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.080\nYou'll bang your head against the wall.\n\n231\n00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.490\nYou are probably saying \"Ronnie,\nhow do you know?\" Because I did it.\n\n232\n00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.660\nI kept trying to look and\nsaying \"I know it is supposed to be here,\n\n233\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.510\nbut that element does not actually exist.\n\n234\n00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.910\nSo then when I figured it out,\nthat yes it is actually under\n\n235\n00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.740\nsome other different role,\nthen I had to realize that.\n\n236\n00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.700\n>> I can vouch for that.\n\n237\n00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.050\nI had to patch the wall where\nhe was banging his head.\n\n238\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.360\n>> Yeah, you better believe it.\n\n239\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.000\nThere are some times when you think\nthings are going to work out exactly.\n\n240\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.290\nThe way that you think they're gonna\nwork out and they really don't.\n\n241\n00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:08.060\nSo having that on hand, our first\nstep is then to think about this and\n\n242\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.180\nto begin to build this DNS.\n\n243\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:16.870\nNot DNS, to begin to set up our\nweb application proxy server.\n\n244\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.250\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n245\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.020\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n246\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.310\ntake advantage of that proxy server just\nlike I showed you in that diagram here.\n\n247\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.510\nAnd this is this virtual\nmachine right here.\n\n248\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.800\nAnd a lot of times today,\n\n249\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.490\nthat's what you actually see is the proxy\nserver is set up on a virtual machine.\n\n250\n00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.900\nMine is called FS02.\n\n251\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.040\nWhy?\n\n252\n00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.184\nBecause I'm just not that creative.\n\n253\n00:13:36.184 --> 00:13:37.530\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I probably should've just\n\n254\n00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.260\nnamed it proxy, but I named it after\nthe federation server and just said, okay,\n\n255\n00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.770\nhere's a second copy of it,\nand so you'll see that, okay?\n\n256\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.630\nSo now, what do I need to verify, okay?\n\n257\n00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.930\nI need to verify that I have access,\nof course, then, to the Internet,okay?\n\n258\n00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.940\nAnd on the public side, as well.\n\n259\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:59.280\nNow here I'm doing what we\ncall a one to one mapping.\n\n260\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.180\nWhy can't I say that?\n\n261\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.000\nOkay, so internally this proxy\nserver is on my DMZ network.\n\n262\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.238\nOkay, so I got 10.1.230 network.\n\n263\n00:14:08.238 --> 00:14:13.050\nOkay that's gonna be my DMZ and\nI have a Public IP Address.\n\n264\n00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.700\nI can do this in two ways.\n\n265\n00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.520\nIf I wanted to I could go ahead and\n\n266\n00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.940\nmanually set up the public IP\naddress right there on that proxy.\n\n267\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.540\nSet it up,\nmake sure that the firewall says yes,\n\n268\n00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.220\nyou can allow the traffic through and\nthen you're ready to go.\n\n269\n00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.010\nOkay, so we can do that.\n\n270\n00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.960\nBut if you're using a DMZ, maybe then\none to one map is the way to go, and\n\n271\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.850\nthat's the way I have it set up too.\n\n272\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:37.050\nSo I've actually put the Public IP address\n\n273\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:42.050\non that interface out here on\nthe outside of my firewall.\n\n274\n00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:47.320\nThen on the firewall itself,\nI've configured a one-to-one NAT mapping.\n\n275\n00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.860\nRight, a static NAT.\n\n276\n00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:53.060\nSo that public IP address is\ngonna forward traffic on to\n\n277\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.430\nthe internal proxy's IP address.\n\n278\n00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.540\nI also need to configure\nthe rules behind that.\n\n279\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.510\nOnce again, if you're thinking Ronnie,\n\n280\n00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.590\nyou're telling me to do that, well I'm\ntelling you it's gotta get set up right.\n\n281\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.790\nSo if you're not comfortable with it,\nsubmit the support ticket,\n\n282\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.500\nescalate that and say here's what I need.\n\n283\n00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.100\nI need this public IP address\nto be matched here and\n\n284\n00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.090\nthere's also something else.\n\n285\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.468\nI need that public DNS record\nto also get entered in.\n\n286\n00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:23.920\nSo on my end over here,\n\n287\n00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.180\nmy public DNS register,\nthere's one called hover.com, and\n\n288\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.930\nin Hover,\nI actually did create this mapping here.\n\n289\n00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.370\nOn this one, you have to be careful cuz\nthis is what I've tripped up on before.\n\n290\n00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:42.325\nEvery place that you read on the internet\nwill tell you, this mapping should be\n\n291\n00:15:42.325 --> 00:15:46.922\nthe name of the proxy server, and\nthen you put the public IP address out.\n\n292\n00:15:46.922 --> 00:15:52.879\nAnd you see that there it is, fs01,\nand there is the public IP address.\n\n293\n00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:58.060\nFs01 though is actually the name of my\nactive directory federation server.\n\n294\n00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.630\nGive the fully qualified\ndomain name there, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.650\nDo not put the proxy server's name there.\n\n296\n00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.460\nIf you do, it won't work.\n\n297\n00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.533\nOnce again you're probably saying,\nRonnie, how do you know that?\n\n298\n00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:10.033\nI know.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:12.060\n>> Let's just take it on faith there.\n\n300\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.930\nI know.\n\n301\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.428\nSo make sure that that\nget's entered in there.\n\n302\n00:16:15.428 --> 00:16:21.030\nAnd If you are not allowed to do this,\nagain put in the escalation request.\n\n303\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.090\nOnce it is done, they will notify you.\n\n304\n00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.240\nHey, this is done.\n\n305\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.210\nHere is the changes on\nthe firewall configuration test.\n\n306\n00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.320\nVerify that everything works\nthe way that you want to.\n\n307\n00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.590\nSo we are taking care of\njust the basic requirements\n\n308\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.520\nbefore the configurations go on.\n\n309\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.750\nOkay?\n\n310\n00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:43.410\nSecondly, because I also need access\nto the internal network, right?\n\n311\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.990\nThe proxy has to go to the firewall and\n\n312\n00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.580\nbe routed back in down into\nthe ITProTV demo here.\n\n313\n00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:53.864\nI need to make sure that I can actually\nconnect over to that Server as well.\n\n314\n00:16:53.864 --> 00:16:56.930\nAnd so there is actually a connection for\nme, I already verified it.\n\n315\n00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:57.980\nYou know how to verify things like that.\n\n316\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.750\nPing, stuff like that.\n\n317\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.340\nSo I'm not so worried about that.\n\n318\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.620\nBut you do need to make sure that\nthe routing exists between there,\n\n319\n00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.210\nbetween your DNZ as well as that network.\n\n320\n00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.150\nUsually the problem there is gonna be some\nrule that didn't get applied that says,\n\n321\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.570\nyes this machine can connect and\ndock here.\n\n322\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:19.300\nBut as long as you can actually get\nconnected and talk there, you are fine.\n\n323\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.780\nNow the problem that we have,\n\n324\n00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.710\nis that internally on my network,\nI have DNS running.\n\n325\n00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.190\nIt's actually joined to\nthe Active Directory domain.\n\n326\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:31.240\nProxy server is probably not gonna be\njoined to your Active Directory domain, so\n\n327\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.060\nthe DNS server is probably\nnot gonna work for\n\n328\n00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.980\nthat particular proxy server\nthe way that we want it to.\n\n329\n00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.630\nNow you can do this in a couple of ways.\n\n330\n00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.450\nYou can set up another DNS\nserver if you want to.\n\n331\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.010\nEasiest way that I know is to go in and\nmodify the host name,\n\n332\n00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.420\nthe host record is what we want, okay?\n\n333\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.220\nSo in the host record here,\nlet me bring up the file explorer.\n\n334\n00:17:54.255 --> 00:17:57.200\nAnd then I'm going to go to the,\nnot the shared folder,\n\n335\n00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.500\nthat's not gonna bring me where I want.\n\n336\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.770\nLocal disk C Inside of\nthe Windows folder here.\n\n337\n00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.020\nAnd let me see, I can probably be able\nto zoom in just a little bit there.\n\n338\n00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.140\nInside of the Windows folder,\nI'm looking for System32.\n\n339\n00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:15.570\nAnd inside of System32,\nI am looking for drivers.\n\n340\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.200\nAnd of course in there, the etc folder.\n\n341\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.820\nAnd then there is.\n\n342\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.690\nThere's a host file that I'm looking for.\n\n343\n00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:28.260\nI'm gonna right-click,\nselect Open With, and then Notepad.\n\n344\n00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.800\nAnd you'll see right down here,\nI already went ahead and set this up so\n\n345\n00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.470\nyou wouldn't have to watch me type.\n\n346\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.820\nIf you watched our series, watching me\ntype is more of a pain and a struggle for\n\n347\n00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.610\nanybody to get through than for\nyou to see me do this.\n\n348\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:45.400\nBut there is,\nthere is the internal IP address,\n\n349\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.825\nto my active directory federation server.\n\n350\n00:18:48.825 --> 00:18:52.800\nTo the actual fully qualified domain name,\nokay?\n\n351\n00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.950\nSo that way when it resolves the address,\nright, from the outside,\n\n352\n00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.580\nit says hey I need to connect in.\n\n353\n00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.300\nSo what is going to happen?\n\n354\n00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.520\nWell from the public IP side, right?\n\n355\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.090\nIf Mike's on the internet\nsitting there with a laptop,\n\n356\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.810\nhe's going to request to\nlog into Office 365, okay?\n\n357\n00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.300\nWell when he does so, it's going to hit\nOffice 365, and it's going to say wait\n\n358\n00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.630\na minute, the way that Ronnie has this\nset up is for single sign on, which means\n\n359\n00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:23.020\nI need to redirect the authentication to\nhis active directory federation server.\n\n360\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.900\nSo it will actually go and say,\nyou need to look for this.\n\n361\n00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.762\nAnd when it does it, it's going to hit\nHover.com and go, here's where I forward\n\n362\n00:19:31.762 --> 00:19:36.530\nit on to, this particular public IP\naddress, 209 dot whatever it is.\n\n363\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.620\nAnd then it gets to that proxy server.\n\n364\n00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.485\nThe proxy server then looks and goes yeah,\n\n365\n00:19:40.485 --> 00:19:42.754\nthat's supposed to be over\nat the federation server.\n\n366\n00:19:42.754 --> 00:19:44.635\nI need to forward this on to.\n\n367\n00:19:44.635 --> 00:19:47.415\n1.72.16.95.6.\n\n368\n00:19:47.415 --> 00:19:50.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Starting to look a little blurry there.\n\n369\n00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.710\nI'm kinda surprised.\n\n370\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.920\nI even zoomed in.\n\n371\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.510\nBut that's what it's going to do here and\n\n372\n00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.500\nthat's why we need to have\nthis thing set up in that way.\n\n373\n00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.080\nSo you wanna make sure that you do\nadd in that one record over here.\n\n374\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.220\nSo once that's done,\nover there on your internal network side,\n\n375\n00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.340\nyou can do the same thing\nwith your proxy server,\n\n376\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.050\nwith your active directory federation\nserver over there if you want to.\n\n377\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.360\nModify the actual host name and\n\n378\n00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.640\njust set that one record to point\nback if you want to or you can\n\n379\n00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.610\nactually modify your DNS records and\nsay, here's the proxy server over there.\n\n380\n00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.860\nSo if you wanna learn more about that,\n\n381\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.660\ncheck out our other classes there on TMS\nand you'll see how to do that as well.\n\n382\n00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.602\nBut those are some of the basic set-ups.\n\n383\n00:20:31.602 --> 00:20:36.000\nAnd you notice I haven't even\ngotten into the actual install yet.\n\n384\n00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.533\nBut if you don't have those things set up,\nthe chances of the rest of the install\n\n385\n00:20:39.533 --> 00:20:42.851\ngoing well and working-\n>> Not too good..\n\n386\n00:20:42.851 --> 00:20:45.460\n>> Yeah, so if it's not too good there,\n\n387\n00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.950\nthat means set up is actually\nvery important for what we need.\n\n388\n00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:49.519\nOkay?\n\n389\n00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:52.890\nLet's go ahead and config,\nwe're not going to configure.\n\n390\n00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.340\nWe're just going to install the roll and\nI'll show you where I've actually run into\n\n391\n00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.170\nissues with this and\nsee where this is important too.\n\n392\n00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:04.910\nSo when we begin here, I'm going to go\nahead and click on the server manager.\n\n393\n00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:09.190\nAnd make sure I'm actually on\nthe right server, now that I say that.\n\n394\n00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:14.580\nThey all look the same, yeah,\nthey all exactly look the same.\n\n395\n00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.440\nSo I am on the right server.\n\n396\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.170\nAnd from here, I need to install a role.\n\n397\n00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:25.250\nSo the blue bar has actually stopped\nmoving, so I can click on Add Roles here.\n\n398\n00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.400\nAnd this may require a restart; I\nmay have already clicked on it.\n\n399\n00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.123\nThere we go.\nAnd that of course brings up the Ad Rolls\n\n400\n00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.350\nand Features Wizard.\n\n401\n00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.940\nAnd I click Next, and leave it at\nthe default of the roll base or\n\n402\n00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.340\nfeature base installation.\n\n403\n00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:44.500\nClick next here,\nverify I have my proxy server set up, and\n\n404\n00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.560\nthen I'm gonna click Next here.\n\n405\n00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.310\nNow, inside of this you might think,\nRonnie, that's what we need to install,\n\n406\n00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.680\nthe Active Directory Federation Services.\n\n407\n00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.610\nIf you were using the older documentation\njust for the Server 2012 and\n\n408\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:59.050\nnot the R2 version, yes,\nthat's exactly what you would do, and\n\n409\n00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.860\nthen later on, after you install that,\nyou'd end up seeing that there it is.\n\n410\n00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.416\nYou'd see what's something called the\nActive Directory Federation server proxy\n\n411\n00:22:06.416 --> 00:22:07.642\nIs what you would see there.\n\n412\n00:22:07.642 --> 00:22:12.490\nBut we're gonna scroll down instead and\ngo to remote access.\n\n413\n00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:16.170\nNow, there is a funny,\nfunny thing about this here.\n\n414\n00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.900\nWhich is that you're\ngoing why remote access?\n\n415\n00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.900\nWell, let me show you.\n\n416\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.900\nSo of all the places that\nit explains something,\n\n417\n00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.240\nis not right here in the roles here.\n\n418\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.910\nIt's when I click next.\n\n419\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.020\nAnd then right after here I don't\nneed any additional features\n\n420\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.380\nwhatever additional features are needed.\n\n421\n00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.200\nHopefully you'll add those in if\nit actually requires you to and\n\n422\n00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.080\nit will tell you, please add these in,\nand you should be able to do that.\n\n423\n00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.050\nBut I click next here and\n\n424\n00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.150\nthen it's going down to this roll service,\nand there it is.\n\n425\n00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.200\nWeb application proxy.\n\n426\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.600\nNow, the funny thing is, you might think,\nwell, that's just a web caching proxy.\n\n427\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.210\nThe only time that you actually know\nthat this is gonna be effective\n\n428\n00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.010\nwith your active directory,\nfederation services,\n\n429\n00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:03.040\nis if you read this description, and\nthe last sentence says right there,\n\n430\n00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.415\nweb application proxy provides a proxy\nfunctionality for your ADFF servers.\n\n431\n00:23:08.415 --> 00:23:11.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There was no indication of that\n\n432\n00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.530\nanywhere during the install,\nup into that point.\n\n433\n00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.320\n>> It's nice that they moved that over\nthere to remote access servers, is it?\n\n434\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:17.979\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n435\n00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:19.910\nmake sure that everyone is aware of that.\n\n436\n00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.114\n>> Yeah, on the very last line,\n\n437\n00:23:21.114 --> 00:23:23.290\nit's on the very last\nsentence of that description.\n\n438\n00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just a little bit frustrating,\n\n439\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.360\nif you didn't know that.\n\n440\n00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.995\nAnd I really mean this, documentation on\nthe Internet, I'm not saying is sparse,\n\n441\n00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:36.499\nthere's actually quite a bit, but the most\nof it is during that time when they were\n\n442\n00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:40.941\ndoing it at the very beginning with the\nActive Directory Federation Services and\n\n443\n00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:45.380\nthat proxy, and a few of them are actually\ndoing it with a later edition of this and\n\n444\n00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.379\ngetting everything set up the way.\n\n445\n00:23:47.379 --> 00:23:52.359\nSo, you will find some unusually,\nI don't wanna say contradictory so\n\n446\n00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:56.760\nmuch, but different installation\ndocumentation now there.\n\n447\n00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.806\nWhen the official documentation\ndoesn't work for you, and\n\n448\n00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:02.379\nyou go out and search that,\nyou're gonna say Wow.\n\n449\n00:24:02.379 --> 00:24:04.712\nThat really did take a little bit of time.\n\n450\n00:24:04.712 --> 00:24:07.070\nSo I'm just gonna put a check\nmark there and here it is.\n\n451\n00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:11.520\nNow notice it's asking me to install\nan additional server administration tools.\n\n452\n00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.370\nAnd click Next there.\n\n453\n00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:19.090\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and put\na check mark there to say if you need to\n\n454\n00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.990\nreboot, let the thing reboot and\nallow it to install.\n\n455\n00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.850\nOkay?\n\n456\n00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:28.600\nSo the installation process seems to\nfollow through the way that we want to,\n\n457\n00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.100\nand as long as we don't get any errors\nduring the installation process,\n\n458\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.080\nthe configuration should go relatively\nsmoothly but while it's installing,\n\n459\n00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.309\nlet's go ahead and set up the other\npart of this that we need.\n\n460\n00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.650\nSo I got kind of all of those\npre-requisites just about installed here.\n\n461\n00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:52.980\nSo public IP address, public DNS record,\nhost file on the proxy, it's in a DMZ.\n\n462\n00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.210\nI know I have a operational ADFS, but\n\n463\n00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.870\nthe one that I'm missing is this one,\nthe importing the ADFS certificate, okay?\n\n464\n00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:05.648\nNow, you wanna make sure that\nwhen you do something like this,\n\n465\n00:25:05.648 --> 00:25:09.230\nyou go over to your active\ndirectory federation services.\n\n466\n00:25:11.911 --> 00:25:16.440\nAnd it's here that you wanna make\nsure you export it from, right?\n\n467\n00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.850\nSo I'm gonna bring up an MMC, and\n\n468\n00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:25.240\nthen I'm gonna put the add-in snap-in for\nthe certificates here.\n\n469\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.300\nAnd I'm gonna do the computer account.\n\n470\n00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:36.030\nSelect next, verify it says local\ncomputer, and click finish.\n\n471\n00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.380\nAnd then go ahead and click okay.\n\n472\n00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.660\nAnd once I do that, I am now looking for\nthe certificate that was\n\n473\n00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:49.460\ninstalled here, inside of my ADFS server.\n\n474\n00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.990\nSo the one that I have is actually a trial\ncertificate that's gonna end in just a few\n\n475\n00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.230\ndays here.\n\n476\n00:25:54.230 --> 00:26:01.560\nBut notice this says\na Trial Secure Server certificate, okay?\n\n477\n00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.970\nNow I want to make sure that when I\nexport this, so I'm gonna right click,\n\n478\n00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.430\ngo to all tasks and export.\n\n479\n00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:15.400\nAnd as I run through here,\nthe key is yes, export the private key.\n\n480\n00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.730\nIf you don't do that,\nit's not gonna work for you.\n\n481\n00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.587\nSo make sure you export the private key.\n\n482\n00:26:19.587 --> 00:26:23.670\nAnd you continue forward, you can\nadd in some additional information.\n\n483\n00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.290\nThe only other thing t I like is\nactually exporting the extended\n\n484\n00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:27.230\nproperties here too.\n\n485\n00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.730\nWhich means it's gonna actually also\nexport that certificate chain, so\n\n486\n00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.698\nit can verify everything is good, as well.\n\n487\n00:26:33.698 --> 00:26:38.100\nSo you wanna make sure you do that,\nclick next, add in the password, and\n\n488\n00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.176\nyou are ready to go.\n\n489\n00:26:39.176 --> 00:26:42.530\nNow I've all ready done this, so that's\nwhy I'm not going to go through it and\n\n490\n00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.150\ndo it again and again here.\n\n491\n00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:48.020\nBut let me go back now to\nthis federation server.\n\n492\n00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:48.650\nAnd there we go.\n\n493\n00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.330\nAnd we'll click close.\n\n494\n00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.940\nIt looks like everything is finished.\n\n495\n00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.170\nI still need to configure that.\n\n496\n00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.430\nBut for right now, though,\nwhat we would normally see, and\n\n497\n00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.170\nI'll show you I actually exported\nthat certificate, there it is.\n\n498\n00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.250\nLet me restore this.\n\n499\n00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.960\nSo normally when you actually export it,\nyou are now going to put that someplace\n\n500\n00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.180\nwhere you can get access\nto it on that proxy server.\n\n501\n00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:15.440\nAnd then, you're gonna import that entire\ncertificate into your certificate store.\n\n502\n00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.940\nOnce again, I all ready finished this, but\n\n503\n00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.670\nlet me show you kind of\nthe basic process here.\n\n504\n00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:25.920\nNow on this one, if you're not sure what\nto do, just again let somebody else know\n\n505\n00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.060\nthat can help you, if you're not actually\nallowed to do this type of importing in.\n\n506\n00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:36.025\nSame location computer account,\nlocal computer, and click finish,\n\n507\n00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:41.910\nclick okay, and you wanna go into\nthe personal certificate store here and\n\n508\n00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.100\nverify that you've imported it.\n\n509\n00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.110\nThe import is simple.\n\n510\n00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.800\nRight click in the white area,\nalt task, select import,\n\n511\n00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.550\nmake sure you find where that document is,\nand make sure it actually imports it.\n\n512\n00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.180\nOkay, so you wanna make sure that you\nactually do get that installed on there.\n\n513\n00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.960\nNow I have another certificate right\nhere for the actual proxy server itself.\n\n514\n00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.260\nAnd you can see it's actually from\nGeoTrust here, so there is another\n\n515\n00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:10.160\ncertificate on there to help verify\nthe identity of that server if we need to.\n\n516\n00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.970\nBut for right now,\n\n517\n00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:16.510\nthe most important one is that ADFS\nserver is the one that we need, okay?\n\n518\n00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:22.060\nSo from this point on, we need to go\nahead and configure the proxy server\n\n519\n00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:27.600\nto get it working between our ADFS,\nas well as those on the outside world.\n\n520\n00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.980\n>> Fantastic Ronny and\nthat's a lot of information there.\n\n521\n00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.370\nGetting this setup, making sure that\nwe get all those pre-reqs right.\n\n522\n00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.900\nThere's a key part of this,\nas it is with anything right?\n\n523\n00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.160\nThese are the things that you have to\ndo in order for this work right and for\n\n524\n00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.470\neverything to function.\n\n525\n00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.700\nSo you've gotta go through that list,\nyou've gotta check them off one by one\n\n526\n00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.460\nmaking sure they're there, and\nthen were going install that roll in so\n\n527\n00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:53.050\nthe next step then would be to actually\nconfigure, which is what Iâ€™m dying to see.\n\n528\n00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.950\nBut unfortunately Ronnie,\nwe're out of time for this episode so\n\n529\n00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.260\nwe're going to have to hold off and\ndo that on the next episode.\n\n530\n00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.370\n>> Sounds great.\n>> All right.\n\n531\n00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.900\nSo Ryan, thanks for all those great demos.\n\n532\n00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.570\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n533\n00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.372\nMake sure you come back.\n\n534\n00:29:03.372 --> 00:29:08.500\nWe're gonna show you how to configure that\nSSO Federation Proxy in our next episode.\n\n535\n00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.330\nBut for now signing off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n536\n00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.130\n>> And I'm Ryan Wong.\n\n537\n00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.651\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n538\n00:29:12.651 --> 00:29:20.027\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.550\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.740\nToday we're doing our Office 365 content,\nand specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.140\nwe're going to be focusing on\nconfiguring our SSO proxy server.\n\n6\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.310\nNow on a previous episode we've\nalready got it all installed.\n\n7\n00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.170\nWe went through all the pre reqs,\nmade sure we had all of those ready.\n\n8\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.740\nWe got it installed.\n\n9\n00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.950\nNow we've got to through and configure it.\n\n10\n00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.050\nAnd here to help us show how\nto do that is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.810\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n12\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.760\n>> It's going well today.\n\n13\n00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.590\nAs we continue to take a look.\n\n14\n00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.290\nAs setting up this real\nfinal piece to the puzzle,\n\n15\n00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.250\nof everything we're doing with the active\ndirectory federation services.\n\n16\n00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.260\nRemember that when we're setting something\nlike this up, the whole goal behind it,\n\n17\n00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.780\nis so that people on the outside\nof our network boundary, right, so\n\n18\n00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.430\nno longer within our building,\n\n19\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.960\nno longer being covered by the security\ninside of our domains here.\n\n20\n00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.600\nBut on the outside, and they still\nneed accesses to resources inside.\n\n21\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.300\nAs well as on the cloud setting up this\n\n22\n00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.600\nparticular proxy server is\ngoing to help us to do that.\n\n23\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.640\nSo that what we end up doing of\ncourse is sending a single sign on.\n\n24\n00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.170\nA single set of credentials that\nwill give our remote users then\n\n25\n00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.890\naccess not only within in our\non-premises resources that we have.\n\n26\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.250\nBut also to the resources that\nexist up in the cloud for us and\n\n27\n00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.650\nthat is really a key component, right?\n\n28\n00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.440\nSo, the good thing is we can leverage all\nof the existing infrastructure that we\n\n29\n00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.880\nhave already set up.\n\n30\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.690\nIf we previously set up that active\ndirectory federation server inside of our\n\n31\n00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.190\nnetwork, which we have done in previous\nepisodes here We can take that and\n\n32\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.040\nwe're only adding in that final\ncomponent of that single sign on.\n\n33\n00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.120\nSo let's go ahead and take a look here as\na reminder of the topology that I've got\n\n34\n00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.010\nset up for us here, so that we can just\ntake a look at just a little bit closer\n\n35\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.450\nhere for a moment and that way we have\neverything in our mind here ready to go.\n\n36\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.140\nOkay?\n\n37\n00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.630\nSo, the existing\ninfrastructure that I had.\n\n38\n00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.450\nOf course is I've had a Office 365\ntenant accountant that I set up\n\n39\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.510\nunder itprotvdemo.com.\n\n40\n00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.670\nFrom there I also has my domain\nnetwork the itprotvdemo.com network.\n\n41\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.170\nAnd it really consists of two servers.\n\n42\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.370\nAnd a couple of clients.\n\n43\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.530\nOkay, so inside of that structure\nonce I got that setup and\n\n44\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.170\nconnected into Office 365, we set up that\nfederation services, right, the FS01.\n\n45\n00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.230\nWe installed the active directory\nfederation services role,\n\n46\n00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.880\nwe verified that once that was actually\nconnected the way that it needed to\n\n47\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.370\nthat people inside of my network\ncould hit that federation server.\n\n48\n00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.210\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n49\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.620\nAnd you might be wondering okay,\nso what's the big deal?\n\n50\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.770\nWell, it's right then that\nsomeone on the inside,\n\n51\n00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.870\nthey present their On Premises\ndomain credentials, or\n\n52\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.540\nthey can actually use the,\nwhat looks like the email address.\n\n53\n00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.350\nI know it's called a UPN name.\n\n54\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.480\n>> But it looks like an email address,\nand their password.\n\n55\n00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.140\nAnd it authenticates against that\nDC05 right there on my network.\n\n56\n00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.440\nWhen the DC05 validates that,\n\n57\n00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.870\nit allows of course then access to\nresources inside of our network.\n\n58\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.870\nBut now, when somebody on the inside of\nITProTV demos domain, says look I need to\n\n59\n00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.130\nget access to 365 it does not have to\ngo to Office 365 to authenticate again.\n\n60\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.210\nIn theory what should happen,\nif everything is set up correctly,\n\n61\n00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.410\nis that the FF01 will issue\nout a security token service\n\n62\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.450\ntype of token and\nthat will actually issue out a claim.\n\n63\n00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.030\nIt's a claim that Office 365 will\nrecognize and be able to say yes,\n\n64\n00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.640\nwe understand that.\n\n65\n00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.200\nThat means that there\nhas to be a third party\n\n66\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.970\ncertificate that you can\ndownload from the internet.\n\n67\n00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.770\nThat Office 365 recognizes and\nthat actually will be up and ready to go.\n\n68\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.170\nBut this is something we\ndon't want to happen right?\n\n69\n00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.400\nIf people, or actually tele-commuters,\nif they're somewhere else and\n\n70\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.690\nthey're logging in I don't want\nthem coming in from the outside.\n\n71\n00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.150\nThe actual Internet where Office 365 and\nHover.com is,\n\n72\n00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.160\nI don't want them coming internally\ninto my network to have to authenticate.\n\n73\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.350\nBecause if I do that, right,\nthey're already in my network.\n\n74\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.470\nThat's not good.\n\n75\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.190\nSo what we're doing instead,\nis that we set up that proxy server.\n\n76\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.830\nThe proxy server is going to\nbe on a sub-net of its own, so\n\n77\n00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.070\nwhen they actually do authenticate it's\ngoing to send it over to the proxy server.\n\n78\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.780\nThe proxy server then has to communicate.\n\n79\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.510\nOver to the federation server for\nthat process to continue.\n\n80\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.900\nSo it really is for us here.\n\n81\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.930\nThe ability to ensure that outside\nusers can get the same connectivity and\n\n82\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.820\nuse the same credentials\nas those on the inside.\n\n83\n00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.410\n>> Very nice.\nSo\n\n84\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.920\nit keeps our infrastructure safe is really\nwhat it's about because we don't want to\n\n85\n00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.920\nexpose that federation server and\n\n86\n00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.990\nthat domain controller directly to\nthe Internet because yes, it would work.\n\n87\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.800\nIt will allow our users to have that\nSSO capability when they're outside\n\n88\n00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.410\nthe network, but it also means the\npotential for bad people to connect to it.\n\n89\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.460\nBecause we've had to open up the firewall\nand say, yes traffic's allowed to come\n\n90\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.010\nin to my network and\ntalk to this Federation server.\n\n91\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.850\nFor this, the main controller, that's\nwhere their proxy is the middleman, right?\n\n92\n00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.970\nProxy on behalf of, we'll let\nthe outside world talk to the proxy and\n\n93\n00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.020\nthen we'll let the proxy talk\nto the federation server and\n\n94\n00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.360\nthe domain controller that\nare inside the network.\n\n95\n00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.740\nThat gives us layers of security, so\n\n96\n00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.230\nwe don't have to expose everything\ndirectly to the public network.\n\n97\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.650\n>> That's a great way to think about it,\n\n98\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.180\nright, is to keep clear about\nwhy we need this proxy.\n\n99\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.120\nCan you do it the other way?\n\n100\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.330\nYes.\nBut would you ever do it the other way?\n\n101\n00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.930\nWell, you shouldn't is\nwhat it comes down to.\n\n102\n00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.640\nSo just remember that.\n\n103\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.110\nAnd we also, in a previous episode,\ntalked about the prerequisites,\n\n104\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.130\nessentially the things that have to be\nin place before we can get it set up.\n\n105\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.400\nAnd if you haven't seen that episode,\nI do ask that you go back and\n\n106\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.070\ntake a look at that episode.\n\n107\n00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.560\nBecause without that just saying\nI know how to install a roll or\n\n108\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.210\nI know how to do this, don't get me wrong\nyou can do it and you'll probably work\n\n109\n00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.230\nthrough it perfectly fine and\nthen you go, why isn't it working?\n\n110\n00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.800\nWell, it does take a few components and\ngetting things set up\n\n111\n00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.670\nunlike your public DNS registrar, as well\nas getting that public IP address and\n\n112\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.590\ngetting that set up\nthe way it needs to be.\n\n113\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.700\nMaking sure that everything is actually\nworking there on the basic networking\n\n114\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.890\nlevel as well.\n\n115\n00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.970\nAnd from that point then you can go and\n\n116\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.290\nsee that in this episode we're\njust gonna actually now configure.\n\n117\n00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.170\nSo the good thing is Mike we've\nalready installed the roll.\n\n118\n00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.070\n>> And it did take a little bit of time\nand we also previously then took this\n\n119\n00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.260\ntime to import in that\npublic digital certificate.\n\n120\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.875\nI'm not gonna be able to\ncall it what I want it to.\n\n121\n00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:42.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That public digital certificate, right,\n\n122\n00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.660\nfrom our Active Directory\n>> Server into our proxy server here,\n\n123\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.310\nand now we are ready to\nconfigure the actual role here.\n\n124\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.720\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this process right now.\n\n125\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.560\nSo here it is.\n\n126\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.740\nThis is gonna be my proxy\nserver right here, and\n\n127\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.410\nI've called it FS02,\nis what I've called it.\n\n128\n00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.320\nNow, you can name it whatever you want to.\n\n129\n00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.610\nWhen I was actually creating\nthis kind of virtual network for\n\n130\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.630\nus to make sure everything was working,\nI just saw that and, yeah,\n\n131\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.670\nit's essentially been timed\nto the federation's servers.\n\n132\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.590\nSo I called it 02 instead of 01.\n\n133\n00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.170\nName it whatever you want to name it and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n134\n00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.710\nIf I was smart,\nI should have named it Proxy.\n\n135\n00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.700\nIt's probably the easiest thing here.\n\n136\n00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.680\nBut when we finished installing the role,\nokay?\n\n137\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.610\nIt's going to to say, hey,\n\n138\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.860\nthere is not, I mean there's some other\nthings that need to be done here.\n\n139\n00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.430\nAnd you're actually going to tell\nthrough the notification flag\n\n140\n00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.190\n>> You'll see this little\n\n141\n00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.670\nwarning sign that tells you\nthat there's more to be done,\n\n142\n00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.700\nwhich is what we call post\ndeployment configuration.\n\n143\n00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.840\nFrom that point,\nit says configuration is required for\n\n144\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.320\nthe web application proxy at FF02, and\nfor the last couple of days though, I've\n\n145\n00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.010\nnot been able to actually click on that\nlink and it come up, but there it goes.\n\n146\n00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.091\nOkay.\nIt's just me more than anything else,\n\n147\n00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:57.377\nI keep clicking and for one reason or\nanother, it just wouldn't work.\n\n148\n00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:58.315\nSo I went around and\n\n149\n00:07:58.315 --> 00:08:01.788\nmanually was able to launch that\nthing again through another method.\n\n150\n00:08:01.788 --> 00:08:07.140\nBut notice right here it says Web\nApplication Proxy Configuration Wizard.\n\n151\n00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.575\nNow as you actually select\nsomething like this,\n\n152\n00:08:10.575 --> 00:08:16.122\nit is just a simple walk-through, but\nyou can get confused here and I mean it.\n\n153\n00:08:16.122 --> 00:08:20.266\nThat this is something that can actually\ncause a little bit of heartache if you're\n\n154\n00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:23.870\nnot careful, especially about\nselecting the right certificate, and\n\n155\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.220\nthat is the key for us getting this\nset up the way that we want to.\n\n156\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.230\nSo it tells us that this web application\nproxy is remote access server\n\n157\n00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.260\nto publish web applications that end\nusers can interact with from any device,\n\n158\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.430\nprovides functionality for the Active\nDirectory Federation Services to help\n\n159\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.540\nadministrators secure access\nto the Federation Server.\n\n160\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.940\nSo that actually works\nthe way that we want to.\n\n161\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.923\nRemember that during the install,\n\n162\n00:08:46.923 --> 00:08:50.435\nwe don't have any clue of what\nthat actually says right there.\n\n163\n00:08:50.435 --> 00:08:51.628\nAll you're told is yeah,\n\n164\n00:08:51.628 --> 00:08:55.533\nit's a web application proxy and then that\nfinal sentence says, if you're gonna use\n\n165\n00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:59.020\nActive Directory Federation Services\nthis is the role you need to install.\n\n166\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.300\nBut it's really hidden, so\njust be aware of that one.\n\n167\n00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.320\nSo we're gonna click Next here and\nnow it's going to ask for\n\n168\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.200\nsome information, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.045\nThe Federation Service name,\n\n170\n00:09:09.045 --> 00:09:12.340\nnow this is actually something you\ndo need to make sure is exact, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.806\nAnd so, you can't make it up.\n\n172\n00:09:14.806 --> 00:09:16.823\nNow, if I were a smarter man, right?\n\n173\n00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:21.786\nI would have come up with a very generic\nFederation Service DNS name that\n\n174\n00:09:21.786 --> 00:09:25.010\nI can actually attach out\nto that DNS record and\n\n175\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.250\nmake a nice host record for\nit, but I didn't.\n\n176\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.300\nI was trying to be very simple, so\n\n177\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.070\nI just called it the same\nthing as I did right here.\n\n178\n00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.880\nBut let me show you where you can find\nthat if you're not sure about what\n\n179\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.660\nthe Federation Service name is.\n\n180\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.630\nSo what I've done is I've just\nswitched over, I believe,\n\n181\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.330\nyup, to my Federation and\nmy proxy server over here.\n\n182\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.790\nAnd, it's gonna make me log in again.\n\n183\n00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.260\n>> Not the proxy, but\nthe actual federation.\n\n184\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.118\n>> The actual\nActive Directory Federation Server, and\n\n185\n00:09:52.118 --> 00:09:56.389\nfrom here I'm gonna launch up the Active\nDirectory Federation server itself.\n\n186\n00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:58.310\nLet me let the server manager come in.\n\n187\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.650\nAnd then I'll show you where\nthat configuration is so\n\n188\n00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.640\nthat you don't have to go, I wonder\nwhat that name is and get confused here.\n\n189\n00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.000\nSo it can happen, and\nwhat am I looking for here,\n\n190\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.610\nwhich is gonna be\nActive Directory Federation Management.\n\n191\n00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.890\nThis is one of the very\nfew roles which is weird.\n\n192\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.360\nIt shows up here in the tools, Mike,\nbut if I go over here to the left-hand\n\n193\n00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.770\nside and select Active Directory\nFederation Server, normally we\n\n194\n00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.910\nsimply right click on that name, and\nit give us that console to manage it.\n\n195\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.922\nBut notice Mike, here,\nit doesn't show up in this shortcut.\n\n196\n00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:35.470\nVery weird,I don't know why they chose for\nthat role, but\n\n197\n00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.360\nthat's the one role that does that.\n\n198\n00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.100\nYou have to go to Tools and\nActive Directory Federation Management.\n\n199\n00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.710\n>> That is odd.\n\n200\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.200\nMicrosoft is usually really\nbig on consistency and\n\n201\n00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.620\nmaking sure the user interface\nis the same throughout.\n\n202\n00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.777\nSo that one must must\nhave slipped through.\n\n203\n00:10:48.777 --> 00:10:52.209\n>> Yeah and I think that that's exactly\nwhat happened since at some point they did\n\n204\n00:10:52.209 --> 00:10:52.990\nchange it right.\n\n205\n00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.650\nRemember that it used to be called\nthe AD FS 3.0 and now they call it,\n\n206\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.500\nof course, it's actually just\nActive Directory Federation Services,\n\n207\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.250\nmore integrated in is what\nthis actually is gonna be.\n\n208\n00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.910\nSo from here, if I go ahead and\n\n209\n00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.680\nclick on the word Service inside of the\nActive Directory Federation Server, and\n\n210\n00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.590\nthen I select, let's see here,\nis it under Service?\n\n211\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.330\nLet me make sure if it's actually right,\nhey, there it is.\n\n212\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.350\nOkay, so this is what you're looking for.\n\n213\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.910\nSo let me do that again.\n\n214\n00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:27.120\nSo I clicked on the Service node under\nActive Directory Federation Service and\n\n215\n00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.930\nthen over here on the Actions pane\n\n216\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.730\nI selected\nEdit Federation Service Properties.\n\n217\n00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.033\nRight here, notice there's a display name,\nthat's not the one you need.\n\n218\n00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:38.533\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n219\n00:11:38.533 --> 00:11:39.375\n>> So, right away,\n\n220\n00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:42.460\nthat's not the one you need.\nIt is right here,\n\n221\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.200\nat Federation Service name, okay?\n\n222\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.050\nSo if you're unsure when\nyou get to this point,\n\n223\n00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.080\nlet me go over to this\nvirtual machine over here.\n\n224\n00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.240\nIf you're unsure when you get to\nthis point in the install, and\n\n225\n00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.180\nyou go, is it ADFSmydomain.com?\n\n226\n00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.700\nIs it the name of the server over there,\nwhatever it is?\n\n227\n00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.476\nIf you need to find that name and\nyou're unsure, make sure you launch it up,\n\n228\n00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.958\ngo to Service and select the Edit\nFederations Services property, and\n\n229\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.867\nyou'll see it right here,\nthe Federation Service name.\n\n230\n00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:13.410\n>> Nice.\n\n231\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.640\n>> Yeah.\nSo make sure you absolutely can find that.\n\n232\n00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.760\nIf not, you're gonna have a hard day\nsetting up that Federation Service,\n\n233\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.820\nguarantee you, especially if\nit's pointed to something else.\n\n234\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:29.890\nSo I'm gonna do FS01 and\nthen ITProTVdemo.com,\n\n235\n00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.020\nand now there's a couple of things you\ncan do here on disk credentials for\n\n236\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.570\nthe local administrator account\non the Federation Server, okay?\n\n237\n00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.830\nSo the recommended practice over on the\nFederation Service, and we mentioned this\n\n238\n00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.870\nin those episodes, so go back and\ntake a look at that if you need to.\n\n239\n00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:49.520\nBut just as a reminder, what you normally\ndo when you install that Federation Server\n\n240\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.070\nis you also create a service account name,\nokay?\n\n241\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.590\nSo that way you need to give\nit domain admin credentials,\n\n242\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.220\nbut you wanna set the password to not\nexpire, but you need that account for\n\n243\n00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.320\nthe way that the Active Directory\nFederation Services works.\n\n244\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.970\nSo normally they recommend that you set\nthat up and then you actually use that\n\n245\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.152\naccount, through whatever credentials\nthat they ask you to put in there.\n\n246\n00:13:12.152 --> 00:13:14.150\nYou wanna do the same thing here, you can.\n\n247\n00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.740\nPerfectly fine that you do that here and\nthat's what I'm going to do.\n\n248\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:22.130\nYou can use regular administrative\ncredentials as well, because it is\n\n249\n00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:26.420\nactually just going over to that Active\nDirectory Federation Service name, but\n\n250\n00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:31.570\nremember that means that sometimes\nif our password then times out and\n\n251\n00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.370\nthis device now needs\nto confirm something,\n\n252\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.530\nit doesn't have those credentials, and\nyou have to reenter those credentials.\n\n253\n00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:42.120\nNot a bad idea necessarily, but if you're\nlike me and you set it and forget it,\n\n254\n00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.960\nan Active Directory Federation Services\nis supposed to be designed that way,\n\n255\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.150\nset it up and forget it.\n\n256\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.280\nWell then you might choose to\nuse a service name instead, but\n\n257\n00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.400\nyou can use either one at this point\nduring this configuration here.\n\n258\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.088\nSo mine is ad,\nI'm gonna do the proper here,\n\n259\n00:14:00.088 --> 00:14:05.171\nITProTVdemo back slash and\n\n260\n00:14:05.171 --> 00:14:08.930\nthen adfs-service.\n\n261\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:13.390\nAnd then of course enter in\nmy super secret password, and\n\n262\n00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:18.370\nas long as I've typed in everything okay,\nI can connect to Nectar, okay?\n\n263\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.850\nNow this would seem easy\nenough at this point here.\n\n264\n00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.310\nThe way that it's described over\nhere in the blue is the key, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:32.400\nAD FS Proxy Certificate, the problem is\nthis is what I think it means, right?\n\n266\n00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.963\nThe certificate that I assigned\nto this proxy server itself and\n\n267\n00:14:36.963 --> 00:14:39.813\nif you use that it's not going to work.\n\n268\n00:14:39.813 --> 00:14:41.296\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n269\n00:14:41.296 --> 00:14:43.320\n>> So in previous versions, though, right?\n\n270\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:49.305\nWhen we were doing the AD FS 3.0 and\nusing the AD FS proxy service server,\n\n271\n00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:53.118\nthat's kind of a long\nmouthful of words there.\n\n272\n00:14:53.118 --> 00:14:56.160\nYou did,\nyou used a server certificate, okay?\n\n273\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.640\nThe actual one that you would get for\n\n274\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:02.710\nthis one, but now,\nthe way they've changed it, you do not.\n\n275\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.230\nWhat you wanna make sure that you pick,\n\n276\n00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.380\nnotice that I have both certificates,\nright?\n\n277\n00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.080\nIf I got a certificate saying, hey, this\nis a proxy server that is gonna be facing\n\n278\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.290\nthe internet, I need to have a third\nparty certificate on there to verify that\n\n279\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.650\nyou are connected to the right one.\n\n280\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.640\nImagine me sending Mike to, yeah,\nyou are gonna log on here, and\n\n281\n00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.020\nnow Mike's computer hits the proxy server,\n\n282\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.070\nwell it should be able to validate\nthat this is the right proxy server.\n\n283\n00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.460\nAnd Mike now gets an error that says,\nyou shouldn't trust this.\n\n284\n00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.882\nWell, that's what's gonna happen.\n\n285\n00:15:32.882 --> 00:15:36.280\nIt's gonna happen on this one,\nanyway, so we will see that.\n\n286\n00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.460\nBut what you want here is\nthe AD FS Server Certificate, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.160\nSo the FS01.\n\n288\n00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.957\nNow I am getting a warning, and that's\nbecause I'm using a trial certificate, so\n\n289\n00:15:46.957 --> 00:15:49.093\nthis actually makes it good for you.\n\n290\n00:15:49.093 --> 00:15:52.928\nAnd the reason why I wanna mention this,\nis if you're like me, and\n\n291\n00:15:52.928 --> 00:15:57.673\nyou're saying look, I don't really have\nthe ability to set all this up, you do.\n\n292\n00:15:57.673 --> 00:16:01.580\nThere are gonna be those third party\ndigital certificate sites that want you to\n\n293\n00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.330\nbuy a digital certificate.\n\n294\n00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:08.690\nBut they'll give you a 30 day lease or\na trial certificate so\n\n295\n00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:13.360\nthat you can use it to set it up and\nsee, is this worth setting up?\n\n296\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.200\nWhy, because you have to purchase\nthose certificates for a year, and\n\n297\n00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.800\nthey can be expensive.\n\n298\n00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.380\nSo it's not like you get to go, ahh\nmaybe in a week I don't want anymore and\n\n299\n00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.600\nI'll get, no,\nthese things can cost a bit of money.\n\n300\n00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.000\nBut they'll give you 30\ndays to try it out here.\n\n301\n00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.500\nMake sure it's set up.\n\n302\n00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.820\nIf it is, it's the way you want to,\nyour organization will foot the bill for\n\n303\n00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.770\nthis certificate.\n\n304\n00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.870\nYou'll be off and you're ready to go.\n\n305\n00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.740\nSo you can get that.\n\n306\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.550\n>> Fantastic, yeah that makes it a little\nbit easier when we're learning and testing\n\n307\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:44.890\nand trying things out to be able to use\ntrials and those temporary certificates.\n\n308\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.040\n>> It really does, right?\n\n309\n00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.500\nSo you don't really have an excuse to say,\nwell I can't really get this thing set up.\n\n310\n00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.610\nYou can also use internal certificates\nif you want to just for the trial.\n\n311\n00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.250\nBut remember that when you approach it\nfrom the outside, you're still gonna get\n\n312\n00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.730\na warning and I'm still gonna get\na warning, too, because of the way that\n\n313\n00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.560\nthat fs02 certificate's not gonna line\nup the way that we want it to as well.\n\n314\n00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.640\nBut for right now, this is what we need.\n\n315\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.740\nThis is what's gonna actually\nmake the encrypted connection\n\n316\n00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.890\nover to the Active Directory\nfederation service.\n\n317\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.730\nSo I need to make sure I do this.\n\n318\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:18.080\nNow, the key here is you\nreally wanna make sure\n\n319\n00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.070\nthat this is the proper certificate, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:24.250\nBefore you go over to the other side.\n\n321\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.910\nBefore you click Next.\n\n322\n00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.693\nWhat will happen is,\nimmediately after you do this,\n\n323\n00:17:29.693 --> 00:17:36.220\nthe proxy server itself is gonna generate\nits own self-signed certificate, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.460\nAnd when it generates its\nown self-signed certificate,\n\n325\n00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.500\nguess what certificate\nit really wants to use?\n\n326\n00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.380\nIt wants to use itself, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.160\nSo make sure you select the right one.\n\n328\n00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.780\nIf you don't, it's gonna automatically\nsay, well, I sign my own certificate.\n\n329\n00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.420\nI trust my own certificate, okay?\n\n330\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.040\nSo if you click Next, and\nthen you click Previous again,\n\n331\n00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.760\nyou're gonna end up seeing that\nthere's another certificate there.\n\n332\n00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.670\nThat's the one it's going to want to use.\n\n333\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.190\nSo it's best if you select it right now,\n\n334\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.670\nverify that this is the proper\ncertificate before you do that.\n\n335\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.470\nIf not, you're gonna run into a couple\nof issues where you're gonna say,\n\n336\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.230\nI don't know why it's not working,\nI'm following those same steps.\n\n337\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.053\nVery key.\n\n338\n00:18:11.053 --> 00:18:12.098\n>> Very Good.\n\n339\n00:18:12.098 --> 00:18:16.085\n>> [LAUGH] I'll bet you're wondering\nhow the heck do I know that one?\n\n340\n00:18:16.085 --> 00:18:17.184\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm thinking Ronnie,\n\n341\n00:18:17.184 --> 00:18:18.425\ndid you pick the other one one time?\n\n342\n00:18:18.425 --> 00:18:19.447\nDid you click previous once?\n\n343\n00:18:19.447 --> 00:18:21.890\n>> I have, I have.\n\n344\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.861\nSo this is how you actually make\nsure that you know that you\n\n345\n00:18:24.861 --> 00:18:26.120\nare selecting the right one.\n\n346\n00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.050\nOkay, so here it is, confirmation.\n\n347\n00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.590\nThis is really the step that\nwe wanted to get to as well.\n\n348\n00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.940\nNotice right there what you see.\n\n349\n00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.657\nIt tells you install\nthe web application proxy,\n\n350\n00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:39.930\nfederation services trust credentials.\n\n351\n00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.930\nIt knows what it's doing here.\n\n352\n00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.840\nNotice that certificate thumbprint.\n\n353\n00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:50.050\nThat is absolutely 100% key for\nyou right now.\n\n354\n00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.030\nAs you click Next and it says,\n\n355\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.930\nlook hey, this doesn't match\nthe thumbprint that I'm expecting to see.\n\n356\n00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.720\nWell, now you know that\nyou didn't change it.\n\n357\n00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.320\nSo you need to be able to verify that\nparticular certificate number and\n\n358\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.780\nthat is key for us here.\n\n359\n00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.120\nSo let me show you how\nI actually did it here.\n\n360\n00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.980\nI brought up an MMC console.\n\n361\n00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:18.380\nAnd then Add and Remove Snap-in,\nselected certificates,\n\n362\n00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.020\nclicked Add,\nwanna add in my Computer account.\n\n363\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.870\nVerify a local computer, Finish, click OK.\n\n364\n00:19:27.002 --> 00:19:31.440\nAnd it's right here, I can go and\nfind that particular certificate.\n\n365\n00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.440\nAnd then if I right-click and\ngo to Properties.\n\n366\n00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.750\nNot properties,\nI just need to show this certificate.\n\n367\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.390\nSee?\n\n368\n00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:38.460\nStuff that I don't remember.\n\n369\n00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.810\nGo to Details, oops.\n\n370\n00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.002\nWhat I am looking for is that thumbprint.\n\n371\n00:19:46.002 --> 00:19:49.439\nSo if I can find it, maybe.\n\n372\n00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:50.400\nWhat did I do?\n\n373\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.210\nMaybe that's what I forgot.\n\n374\n00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.150\nThere it is.\n\n375\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.263\nThumbprint, okay?\n\n376\n00:19:57.263 --> 00:20:02.692\nSo you want to verify that this, let me\nhit the right key here, that this number\n\n377\n00:20:02.692 --> 00:20:08.140\nthat you're seeing right here matches\nwhat you see in that confirmation box.\n\n378\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:08.870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n379\n00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.680\n>> Okay, that is the one because that is\nthe certificate for my federation server.\n\n380\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.050\nVerify that that is actually\nkey if you are unsure.\n\n381\n00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.705\nI can just minimize that right now and it\nis cuz I've seen that multiple times here.\n\n382\n00:20:21.705 --> 00:20:23.730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now by doing this.\n\n383\n00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.800\nSo, you really will, if not,\nyou'll end up saying, okay,\n\n384\n00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.170\nit's saying that I don't have the proper\ncertificate, I don't do this, and\n\n385\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.880\nyou'll keep flipping your head backward or\nforward trying to make sure it works.\n\n386\n00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.090\nAnd it's not going to, and\nthat's kinda one of the weird things.\n\n387\n00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.540\nSo, make sure that you actually do that.\n\n388\n00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.569\nSo, now, at this point,\nI just need to click Configure.\n\n389\n00:20:44.569 --> 00:20:48.586\n>> And if everything is set up, and\nI have to use my operative term, if.\n\n390\n00:20:48.586 --> 00:20:53.334\nIf everything is set up correctly,\nin other words, if it's talking to\n\n391\n00:20:53.334 --> 00:20:58.280\nthe proxy server, the only thing\nwe should see here is right there.\n\n392\n00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.050\nWeb application proxy was\nconfigured successfully.\n\n393\n00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.200\n>> Nice.\n>> Okay, so what does this mean?\n\n394\n00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.080\nIt means that the web application\nproxy said, I'm supposed to talk to\n\n395\n00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.320\nthe federation server and the federation\nserver says, yeah that's me.\n\n396\n00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.220\nAnd so we now have that established\ncommunication between them, but\n\n397\n00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:23.000\nwe're not done yet\nin the idea of the confirmation, okay?\n\n398\n00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.646\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look now.\n\n399\n00:21:24.646 --> 00:21:28.001\nNow that everything is set up,\nlet me zoom out here.\n\n400\n00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:30.330\n>> I have to say that it was\na little bit anticlimactic.\n\n401\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.170\n>> By far, I know.\n\n402\n00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.185\n>> One sentence on a big white analog box.\n\n403\n00:21:33.185 --> 00:21:33.685\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know.\n\n404\n00:21:33.685 --> 00:21:34.933\nYou would think that it'd be\n\n405\n00:21:34.933 --> 00:21:38.212\nlike this big splash screen that says,\ncongratulations, or something.\n\n406\n00:21:38.212 --> 00:21:38.741\nBut no,\n\n407\n00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:43.540\nit's kind of that one sentence kind\nof let me down there is what we see.\n\n408\n00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.050\nSo, by default, it opens up to the remote\naccess management console, which again,\n\n409\n00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.580\nis less than intuitive for us.\n\n410\n00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.980\nAnd then over on the left hand side, we\nhave the web application proxy over here\n\n411\n00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.310\nand what we're looking for\nis Operation Status.\n\n412\n00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.520\nWhen we select Operation Status,\nyou're looking for the color green, Mike,\n\n413\n00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.470\nis what we're looking for here.\n\n414\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:04.340\n>> Green is good.\n\n415\n00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.260\n>> Green is good.\n\n416\n00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.010\nWhen you see red, no good.\n\n417\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.660\nSo red x's mean that it's no good.\n\n418\n00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.560\nThe problem is on this one, and\nthis is kind of the big letdown,\n\n419\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.720\nit doesn't let you do anything.\n\n420\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.880\nThere's actually only a couple\nof things you can do,\n\n421\n00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.190\nwhich is really monitor from here.\n\n422\n00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.580\nAnd that's what we want to take a look at.\n\n423\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.230\nFirst place,\n\n424\n00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:28.710\nif I'm troubleshooting the connection\nbetween them, is to go right here, okay?\n\n425\n00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:32.760\nSo, if you have closed out of this\ncompletely and you're now in the server\n\n426\n00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.660\nmanager, you just select Remote Access,\nand then you can right-click.\n\n427\n00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.275\nAnd on this one,\nit doesn't say web application proxy,\n\n428\n00:22:41.275 --> 00:22:44.710\nMike, notice it says\nRemote Access Management.\n\n429\n00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.570\nAnd then when that window opens up,\nthis is the key here.\n\n430\n00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:53.270\nIs that you'll actually see it right there\nand then you unselect Operation Status.\n\n431\n00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:57.874\nSo, I did want to show you that because,\nit is very easy to get confused.\n\n432\n00:22:57.874 --> 00:23:01.970\nSo which of these nodes would you actually\nopen up if you needed to validate\n\n433\n00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.740\nthat the proxy server was working?\n\n434\n00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.570\nYou would think that there would be a node\nover on the left hand that said what?\n\n435\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:07.990\nWeb application proxy.\n\n436\n00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.870\n>> Exactly.\n\n437\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.740\n>> There isn't.\nYou would think that, hey, okay,\n\n438\n00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.530\nI'm gonna always wonder remote access and\nso I'll just go to that particular server\n\n439\n00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:19.570\nand right-click on it and\nselect web application proxy.\n\n440\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.188\nNo, once again, remote access management.\n\n441\n00:23:22.188 --> 00:23:24.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's pretty intuitive, Mike.\n\n442\n00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.274\n>> Yeah, it is.\n\n443\n00:23:25.274 --> 00:23:27.736\nWell, that's why we have to pay for\nour training.\n\n444\n00:23:27.736 --> 00:23:29.791\n>> Yeah, you better believe it.\n\n445\n00:23:29.791 --> 00:23:32.993\n>> Once we've got the wizard gone through,\n\n446\n00:23:32.993 --> 00:23:38.217\ncompleted successfully,\nwe saw we had green check marks on there.\n\n447\n00:23:38.217 --> 00:23:40.730\nOther ways we can confirm\nthat things are working?\n\n448\n00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.920\n>> And\nthat's why I wanna do it from here, okay?\n\n449\n00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.160\nWe can, everybody knows,\nand I'm the worst at this.\n\n450\n00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.891\nEvent Manager is supposed\nto be your friend, okay?\n\n451\n00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:52.333\nEvent Manager to me is more of the,\nit's working,\n\n452\n00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:54.986\nwho cares what the Event Manager says.\n\n453\n00:23:54.986 --> 00:23:58.015\nYou do, especially when you're\nactually doing something like this.\n\n454\n00:23:58.015 --> 00:24:01.146\nAnd the problem is there's so\nmany events now that are going on.\n\n455\n00:24:01.146 --> 00:24:03.370\nAnd I want you to do it through here.\n\n456\n00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:08.530\nThe reason why is if you look over\nhere at the right hand side, okay,\n\n457\n00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.800\nit has a nice little link for you.\n\n458\n00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.050\nNow you probably wanna, okay, big deal,\nit's got a little shortcut for us, but\n\n459\n00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:16.640\nI wanna show you something else too.\n\n460\n00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.480\nLet me see, if I can zoom out here.\n\n461\n00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.380\nIf I open the event manager from,\nor the event viewer,\n\n462\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.250\nevent manager, if I open the event viewer\nfrom here, now Mike I know that my screen\n\n463\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.910\nis just a little bit small, but\nI do want you to see something here, okay?\n\n464\n00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.300\nSo I'm gonna scroll in a little bit.\n\n465\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.650\nNotice, what actually was created\nover here on the left hand side,\n\n466\n00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.660\nwithout you and I having to do it.\n\n467\n00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.130\nThey're actually filters.\n\n468\n00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.130\n>> Nice.\n>> So in other words,\n\n469\n00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.500\nthe web proxy server management said,\nwhat?\n\n470\n00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.210\nHere's what you're really zooming in on.\n\n471\n00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:49.640\nHere's what you're really focusing in on,\nto try and verify that things are up.\n\n472\n00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.425\nI didn't have to go in and go,\nI wonder what I'm looking for.\n\n473\n00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:53.280\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n474\n00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.120\n>> The web application proxy says,\nlet me filter it out and\n\n475\n00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.630\nlet me show you what filter\nyou should be looking for.\n\n476\n00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:03.550\nOkay, so\nright away if I select ADFS admin,\n\n477\n00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.820\ncuz that's the first one\nthat was actually there,\n\n478\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.030\nI'm trying to make sure I don't move\nit too much to make you too sick.\n\n479\n00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.260\nBut I can't guarantee you, I'm not.\n\n480\n00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.220\nIs right here, where it says, information.\n\n481\n00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.680\nAnd notice the event ID 245.\n\n482\n00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.540\nOkay.\n\n483\n00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.830\nFederation server proxy successfully\nretrieved as configuration from\n\n484\n00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.250\nthe federation server.\n\n485\n00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.990\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n486\n00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.240\nThat means it communicated,\n\n487\n00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:30.290\nit got the configuration from\nthe federation server, pulled it on in.\n\n488\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.470\nThe other one is key here, too.\n\n489\n00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.270\nThis is the one that verifies,\nthat everything started and\n\n490\n00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:42.010\nis working successfully, event ID 198.\n\n491\n00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.350\nI would remember event ID's here.\n\n492\n00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:48.680\nYou're going to see that later on,\nI don't know how else to describe that.\n\n493\n00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.950\nSo if you're verifying\nthat it's working and\n\n494\n00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:55.195\nthe only element that you have in\nfront of you is the event viewer.\n\n495\n00:25:55.195 --> 00:25:56.250\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n496\n00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:59.350\n>> You need to know that these\nare kind of the two events I tell you.\n\n497\n00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.935\n>> Tells where, they were again 195.\n\n498\n00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:02.421\n>> 245.\n\n499\n00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:03.218\n>> 245.\n\n500\n00:26:03.218 --> 00:26:04.385\n>> And 198.\n\n501\n00:26:04.385 --> 00:26:05.642\n>> 198.\nOkay, yeah.\n\n502\n00:26:05.642 --> 00:26:06.207\n>> 245 and 198.\n>> Yeah,\n\n503\n00:26:06.207 --> 00:26:10.460\ncuz there are types\nwhere you will see that,\n\n504\n00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.840\nthe only you can confirm that things are\nworking right is in the event view, okay.\n\n505\n00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.480\nI mean, that's pretty much it.\n\n506\n00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.760\nAnd if that's your only option, well how\nwill you confirm it, if you don't know\n\n507\n00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.820\nwhat the events you're looking for\nthat confirm, that it's operational.\n\n508\n00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.520\nSo those are really the two big\nevents that you're looking for.\n\n509\n00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.670\nSo that actually means that\neverything else is set up,\n\n510\n00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.580\nin the way that we actually\nneed it to be set up here.\n\n511\n00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.810\nSo if we now go ahead and verify.\n\n512\n00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:35.930\nAnd so,\n\n513\n00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.750\nyou might still have to do a little bit\nof troubleshooting after this, right?\n\n514\n00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.710\nDid you get your DNS records setup right?\n\n515\n00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:42.950\nAnd that's kind of a big one.\n\n516\n00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.570\nIs your public IP actually answering?\n\n517\n00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.860\nSo, is that setup, is it connected\nthe way it needs to be connected up?\n\n518\n00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.410\nNetworking issues are a big problem,\nespecially if you had never set this thing\n\n519\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:57.040\nup before, so it's very possible that\nyou may still have to do some of that.\n\n520\n00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.720\nBut as far as the Active Directory\nFederation Server goes and\n\n521\n00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.820\nthe proxy server goes,\neverything should be set up.\n\n522\n00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.780\nNow, the true way to verify this thing,\nand\n\n523\n00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.810\nthis is again if,\nif I've set up everything right, okay?\n\n524\n00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.600\nIs I am now gonna go to my own machine,\nI'm off of that network, so\n\n525\n00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.650\nnow I am going to go to what is\ncalled a public network over here.\n\n526\n00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:21.000\nSo there's actually two other,\nactually, there's like ten other\n\n527\n00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.920\nwireless networks that are actually\nout here and around here.\n\n528\n00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.070\nThat, what I'm doing is I'm gonna\nsimulate as actually being on another\n\n529\n00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.050\nnetwork, here.\n\n530\n00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.700\nAnd I am simply going to,\nlet's do this public one over here, okay?\n\n531\n00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.840\nSo in a moment here my IP address is going\nto change on my machine, maybe, okay?\n\n532\n00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.512\nNow, let me verify that it did change.\n\n533\n00:27:45.022 --> 00:27:47.930\nSo that I'm actually not on\nthe same network anymore.\n\n534\n00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.145\nYep, so I actually see that I'm on\na different network here, so that's fine.\n\n535\n00:27:51.145 --> 00:27:53.205\nSo what should happen?\n\n536\n00:27:53.205 --> 00:27:56.500\nMike, what should happen\nis from the public network.\n\n537\n00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:02.080\nIt goes out, office 365 says, hey Ronnie,\nyou're trying to log into ITPro TV demo.\n\n538\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.900\nOkay.\n\n539\n00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.950\nAnd, since my DNS records\nare also set up on Office 365,\n\n540\n00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.530\nsay here's where you're going to log into.\n\n541\n00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.700\nIt's going to turn back to hover.com,\n\n542\n00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.850\nbecause that's where\nthe management of the DNS is.\n\n543\n00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:14.670\nThat should send in a proxy server.\n\n544\n00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:19.030\nProxy server should then,\nforward me on to my federation server.\n\n545\n00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.970\nWe should be able to get it, okay?\n\n546\n00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:22.510\nSo, that's if everything is set up.\n\n547\n00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:27.900\nNow, the way that we do this, let me see\nif I can actually open up a window here.\n\n548\n00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:34.850\nIs that there is a test link,\nfor these server's here.\n\n549\n00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.970\nAnd FS zero one, oops, there it is.\n\n550\n00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.470\nI've already done this before.\n\n551\n00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:40.930\nAnd it's actually one of these, right?\n\n552\n00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.930\nSo whatever your domain name is, ADFS/LS.\n\n553\n00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.380\nAnd then, IDP initiated sign on.\n\n554\n00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.110\nOkay.\n\n555\n00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.740\nSo if I connect there, now notice\nit's giving me this privacy error.\n\n556\n00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.700\nAnd I told you that this is gonna fail,\nbecause my My server\n\n557\n00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.040\ncertificate that I have on my proxy server\nis not really valid at this point, but\n\n558\n00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:07.160\nI am going to click advanced, and\nthen proceed on to FS 01, and there it is.\n\n559\n00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:12.300\nThis is actually being distributed\nby my ADFS server now, okay?\n\n560\n00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.450\nSo once I select that,\nI select sign in to this site and\n\n561\n00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:20.571\nI'm just gonna use Wes's name.\n\n562\n00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:27.567\nWes@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n563\n00:29:27.567 --> 00:29:31.620\nAnd then his super secret password,\nand click enter.\n\n564\n00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.030\nAnd there we are.\n\n565\n00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.310\nI am now signed on from\na different network.\n\n566\n00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:41.160\nIn to my Active Directory,\ninside of my network.\n\n567\n00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.330\nAnd also, when I go to Office 365,\nit should be signed on there as well.\n\n568\n00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.910\nNow, it doesn't mean that\nwhen you go to the webpage,\n\n569\n00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:49.580\nyou're not gonna have to sign-in.\n\n570\n00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:55.900\nIn theory, right, my Outlook, if I'm using\nthat, should be signed in Office 365.\n\n571\n00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:00.550\nIf I go to my Word or Excel on my machine,\n\n572\n00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:05.550\nit should be signed in to my Office365\nthrough ITPROTV, without me having to\n\n573\n00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.950\nactually enter in credentials again over\nand over to make that work and happen.\n\n574\n00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:14.950\nSo, once we actually are signed on\nhere that is actually a guarantee\n\n575\n00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.540\nthat you've now got at least\na sign-on process working.\n\n576\n00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.500\nNow of course for them to access\nNetwork Resources you still have to go to\n\n577\n00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.340\nthe Active Directory Federation\nserver to make claims, and\n\n578\n00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.670\nto do some of the other things that\nwill allow them access into those\n\n579\n00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:29.690\nnetwork resources,\nthe way that you want to.\n\n580\n00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:34.730\nBut at least this is the beginning and the\nset-up of everything that we need to do.\n\n581\n00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.700\nNow, there is only one other\nthing I want to mention.\n\n582\n00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.480\nI know we're running\na little bit low on time.\n\n583\n00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.140\nIf you're looking at this, let me go\nahead and show you this webpage again.\n\n584\n00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.610\nI don't wanna save this here.\n\n585\n00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:43.630\nOkay.\n\n586\n00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.795\nNow to you and me,\nthat looks almost decorated, okay?\n\n587\n00:30:46.795 --> 00:30:47.340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But\n\n588\n00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:52.150\nthe very fact is, the only real decoration\nis what I put up here, ITProTV Demo,\n\n589\n00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.340\nas kind of being the name\n>> You can customize this.\n\n590\n00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.470\n>> Company logos, things like that.\n\n591\n00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:59.630\n>> Yeah, company logos.\n\n592\n00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.959\nYou can add in company logos,\nyou can do all that,\n\n593\n00:31:01.959 --> 00:31:03.915\nthe problem that I have is simple, okay?\n\n594\n00:31:03.915 --> 00:31:06.765\nI am not that gifted in HTML.\n\n595\n00:31:06.765 --> 00:31:08.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For\n\n596\n00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.730\nthose of you that know how to play around\nin it, you simply go to the inet pub.\n\n597\n00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:13.410\nFind what?\n\n598\n00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.765\nYour IT Pro TV demo under ADFS.\n\n599\n00:31:15.765 --> 00:31:16.890\n>> Um-hm.\n\n600\n00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:19.930\n>> And you not work with\nWeb pages better than I do.\n\n601\n00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.650\nSo if you wanna actually configure at or\nyou wanna add in like a disclaimer like,\n\n602\n00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:27.660\nyou must be a part of this never to\nsign on and do all that Perfectly fine.\n\n603\n00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.920\nYou can add in all that.\n\n604\n00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.860\nSo you do have the ability to customize\nthis page to do whatever you need,\n\n605\n00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.640\nto to add in this stuff.\n\n606\n00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.300\nI'm pretty sure you can change\nthe background to whatever you want.\n\n607\n00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.530\nBut here it's just kind of that generic\ntemplate that we would expect to see.\n\n608\n00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:43.870\nBut overall though Mike,\nwe have now successfully set up,\n\n609\n00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:47.550\nour web application proxy for\nsingle sign on.\n\n610\n00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.343\nAnd to Office 365.\n\n611\n00:31:49.343 --> 00:31:52.080\n>> Fantastic Ronnie,\nthat was a great demonstration there.\n\n612\n00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.140\nThere's a lot of steps involved getting\nall the pre reqs, getting everything\n\n613\n00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:01.120\ninstalled, and then getting it configured\nproperly, and then finally testing it out.\n\n614\n00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.860\nSo thanks Ronnie for\nthat great demo on setting up that SSO.\n\n615\n00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.870\nNow we've got SSO inside our network.\n\n616\n00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.020\nPeople can come into work.\n\n617\n00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:09.950\nThey sign on once.\n\n618\n00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.090\nThey can access all the resources,\ntheir Office 365.\n\n619\n00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:17.110\nNow they can even do it while they're\nout on the road, when they're traveling,\n\n620\n00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:20.480\nwhen they're at home, if they're\ntelecommuters, whatever the case may be.\n\n621\n00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.990\nThey can also take advantage of that\nsingle sign-on and not be prompted for\n\n622\n00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.970\ncredentials, every time they\nconnect to a different service.\n\n623\n00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.470\nThat's fantastic, thanks for that Ronnie.\n\n624\n00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.960\nAnything else you need to add?\n\n625\n00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.820\n>> Just remember that even though\nthis is kind of the end on the\n\n626\n00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.090\n>> Proxy servers and things like that.\n\n627\n00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.880\nThere is still a little bit more for\n\n628\n00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.370\nus to go, but we're out of time, so\n>> Okay.\n\n629\n00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:42.750\n>> We'll hit that another episode.\n\n630\n00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.890\n>> Very good, we'll save it for later.\n\n631\n00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.910\nSo that means you and I are coming back.\n\n632\n00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:48.240\nAlright, thanks everybody for\nwatching, we hope you enjoyed,\n\n633\n00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.560\nsigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wang.\n\n634\n00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.809\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n635\n00:32:51.809 -->

--> 00:00:17.274\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:20.288\nToday we're doing our Office 365 episodes.\n\n5\n00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:23.900\nAnd specifically, in this one\nwe're gonna look at monitoring and\n\n6\n00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.740\ntrouble shooting your Office 365.\n\n7\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.390\nNot that anything would every\ngo wrong with Office 365,\n\n8\n00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.510\nno, in all seriousness,\nit's a very complex thing.\n\n9\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.960\nWe're dealing with our local network\nwith connectivity out to the cloud,\n\n10\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.170\nwith users inside,\nwith users Outside our network.\n\n11\n00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.390\nSo there is a lot of moving parts to it.\n\n12\n00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.370\nIt's very important that we\nunderstand how to monitor that.\n\n13\n00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.660\nHow to make sure that\neverybody remains connected or\n\n14\n00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.000\ncan get connected when they need to.\n\n15\n00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.140\nHere to help us with that and show us\na whole bunch of cool tools we can use to\n\n16\n00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.270\nmonitor Office 365 is the one and\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n17\n00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.090\nHow you doing Ronnie?\n\n18\n00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.470\n>> I'm doing fine.\n\n19\n00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.498\nHere we are.\nWe're at this point inside of our Office\n\n20\n00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:06.155\n365 series where we do need to take\na look at some of the tools that\n\n21\n00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:11.004\nare available for us to be able to\nmonitor the usage of Office 365.\n\n22\n00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:15.764\nIt wasn't actually so long ago,\nactually as of the filming of this\n\n23\n00:01:15.764 --> 00:01:20.269\nparticular show it was just a couple\nof days ago, one of the most\n\n24\n00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:25.690\npopular uses of the development hubs,\nGitHub, went down for hours.\n\n25\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.160\nOkay, it went down for hours by itself.\n\n26\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.730\nThere were a couple of other events during\nthat week that also ended up happening,\n\n27\n00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.720\nand even during the recording\nof this particular show,\n\n28\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.280\na couple of weeks ago, you know, or maybe\na little bit longer ago, I can't remember.\n\n29\n00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.020\nOffice365 itself went down okay.\n\n30\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.170\nSo you name it, there's always gonna be\nsome issues that you tend to not have\n\n31\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.970\nneeded to ever think about when you're\nonly dealing with on premises things.\n\n32\n00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.130\nWhere now when you are connected\ninto a cloud service\n\n33\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.060\nyou need to know that there are ways that\nyou can at least monitor what's going on.\n\n34\n00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.240\nThere's also gonna be ways\nthat you can also troubleshoot\n\n35\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.950\na lot of the usage that you're\ngonna have with Office 365.\n\n36\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.250\nSo, you can guarantee,\n\n37\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.350\nat least at your end, where you check up\non everything and everything is good.\n\n38\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.040\nBut how is it that you now go and\nconnect into the cloud and\n\n39\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.530\ngo well, I don't know there's\na problem between here and\n\n40\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.860\nOffice 365 now anywhere along that\npath depending on where you are right?\n\n41\n00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.720\nOr is it actually a problem\nover at Office 365 as well?\n\n42\n00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.360\nWell the good thing is those guys over\nthere at Microsoft when they developed\n\n43\n00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.060\nOffice 365 they knew that this\nwould become an issue, right?\n\n44\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.190\nYou troubleshoot everything on your\nend and go, no, my end is fine.\n\n45\n00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.930\nAnd they would probably look at their\nend and go, no, our end's fine.\n\n46\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.380\nSo it's gotta be somewhere in between.\n\n47\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.640\nAnd you don't really have any recourse\non that the majority of the time,\n\n48\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.130\nyou just have to kinda wait it out.\n\n49\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.600\nAnd you can do a little bit of snooping,\nright.\n\n50\n00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.130\nTo try and figure out where places\nalong the backbone, the connection\n\n51\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.940\nbetween you and Office 365 have\nactually ended up going down somewhere.\n\n52\n00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.680\nBut what do you do?\nYou\n\n53\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.630\njust have to wait until that clears up and\nthen you're fine.\n\n54\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.560\nBut the good thing is, like I said,\nwhat you're going to end up seeing here\n\n55\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.650\nin Office 365 though,\nis that there are places for\n\n56\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.810\nyou to be able to monitor the system\nhealth itself on their end, and\n\n57\n00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.680\nthat way,\nif everything on your end is fine,\n\n58\n00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.210\neverything on their end is fine, well then\nit helps you to isolate what we have.\n\n59\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.858\nLet's go ahead and show you where you're\ngonna find some of that information.\n\n60\n00:03:28.858 --> 00:03:30.520\nSo, I'm gonna actually on my machine,\n\n61\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.200\nI'm using a Windows machine today, because\nthere's a couple of different things\n\n62\n00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.590\nthat will work better on\na Windows machine, as well, and\n\n63\n00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.870\nall the tools that Office tends to\ndevelop, it's not gonna be for Macs, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.860\nAnd then even though I'm on a Mac\ncomputer, it's not gonna be for a Mac.\n\n65\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.460\nIt's usually gonna be for\na Windows based computer.\n\n66\n00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.410\nSo if you want to take advantage\nof the full functionality of\n\n67\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.340\neverything that Microsoft Office 365\ngives you, that's what you want to be on.\n\n68\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.260\nAnd there's nothing I\ncan do to change that.\n\n69\n00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.280\nMore than likely, you're probably\nnot gonna change it either.\n\n70\n00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.640\nAs much as you may love Mac computers,\nyou're probably gonna find out they're not\n\n71\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.480\ngonna redevelop a troubleshooting tool\nthat's designed to be on that computer.\n\n72\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.120\nAnd they may add one in there\nat some later date, but\n\n73\n00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.130\nthe primary focus of course\nis gonna be on Windows, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.360\nSo what you're seeing right here in\nfront of you is when you first log into\n\n75\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.230\nMicrosoft Office 365, right?\n\n76\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.090\nSo when you go in there, if you log in as\nthe admin, you want to make sure then,\n\n77\n00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.130\nthat you actually go over to\nyou options button up here.\n\n78\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.690\nAnd select the admin tile, or button.\n\n79\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.900\nWhatever they want to call it today.\n\n80\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.960\nAnd make sure that you get into\nthe Office 365 admin console.\n\n81\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.750\nNow once you're in the admin console,\n\n82\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.120\nyou really don't have to navigate\nvery much anywhere else here.\n\n83\n00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.210\nAnd you'll see that on this\npage in particular, and\n\n84\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.610\nI'm just gonna scroll down\nthat page a little bit.\n\n85\n00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.230\nNow let me see if I can zoom in just\na bit here so that we can see it.\n\n86\n00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.200\nYou'll see that there's a service\noverview section on that dashboard.\n\n87\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.810\nAnd so this is key.\n\n88\n00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.860\nIf you are actually going to be suspecting\nissues that go on on Office 365 one thing\n\n89\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.590\nthat should tell you at least you have\npartial functionality is you logging in.\n\n90\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.440\nOkay.\nIf you can get to their site\n\n91\n00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.890\nyou at least have partial functionality.\n\n92\n00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.520\nBut notice the list here, and\n\n93\n00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.790\nthere's actually marks right here\nin the center I'm trying not to go\n\n94\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.140\ntoo fast there as I'm zoomed in,\nthat are gonna be of this color.\n\n95\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.340\nHopefully, the majority of the time,\nit's gonna be green.\n\n96\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.910\nMike, you and I have talked about this.\n\n97\n00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.510\nOne of the colors that we love, especially\nwhen we're looking at monitoring, green.\n\n98\n00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.860\n>> Absolutely, I learned from you.\n\n99\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.845\nGreen is good, right?\n\n100\n00:05:35.845 --> 00:05:40.380\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, with the green here,\nit's a very easy visual reminder that\n\n101\n00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.980\nthere's actually not gonna\nbe well anything going on.\n\n102\n00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.420\nIn other words that probably\nis actually functional.\n\n103\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.510\nNow if you're like other people right,\ngreen is just a color for you.\n\n104\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.870\nYou don't care or\nyou may even be color blind.\n\n105\n00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.836\nNotice over here there's\nactually a no issues found.\n\n106\n00:05:55.836 --> 00:06:00.458\nSo on each one of the services that\nMicrosoft ends up offering and\n\n107\n00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:03.461\ncan tie into your Office 365 account.\n\n108\n00:06:03.461 --> 00:06:06.650\nIn other words you can actually\ncombine them together.\n\n109\n00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.530\nWell, what does Office do?\n\n110\n00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.050\nOffice 365 gives you the service help and\ntells you, for example,\n\n111\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.170\nonline exchange servers all around the\nworld for right now, everything is good.\n\n112\n00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.770\nYour identity services this is kind\nof the Office 365 way of saying\n\n113\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.053\nAzure Active Directory but\nkind of a very limited version,\n\n114\n00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:31.660\nthe only one that work with Office 365\nthat there are no issues with that one and\n\n115\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.120\nthen of course the portal\nitself where you're logged in,\n\n116\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.720\nthat should actually indicate and\nnothing else is going on.\n\n117\n00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.930\nSubscription services, if you want\nto pay for something, buy something,\n\n118\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.410\nI guarantee you if there's any one\nthat's gonna be up 99.999% of the time,\n\n119\n00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.120\nit's gonna be the Office subscription.\n\n120\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.850\n>> Absolutely.\n\n121\n00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.090\n>> It would not behoove them for\nthat one to ever go down.\n\n122\n00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.430\nJust in case, even during your outage.\n\n123\n00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.520\nYou can't do anything.\n\n124\n00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.130\nThey still want you to be\nable to purchase something.\n\n125\n00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.250\nIt makes sense for them.\n\n126\n00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.800\nAnd of course there's Rights Management.\n\n127\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.360\nShare Point if you're gonna\nbe integrating that in.\n\n128\n00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.330\nSkype for Business,\nSway and Yammer, right.\n\n129\n00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.330\nYour own personal kind of Facebook for\nyour organization.\n\n130\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.120\nYou wanna do that.\n\n131\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.210\nRight now nothing is actually showing\nup as having any issues at all.\n\n132\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.970\nAnd that is a good day.\n\n133\n00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.910\nSo when you take a look at monitoring,\njust having that nice summary overview\n\n134\n00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.590\nright there when somebody says hey,\nis something going on?\n\n135\n00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.720\nYou don't have to go and\nexplore too deeply.\n\n136\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.840\nDon't get me wrong,\nyou can get deeper into this.\n\n137\n00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.030\nBut right here's a great place for\nus to at least have a summary.\n\n138\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.830\n>> So this is showing me on\nMicrosoft's end, everything is up and\n\n139\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:38.680\nrunning for them?\n\n140\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.670\nSo, again, going back to what you\nwere saying, trying to determine,\n\n141\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.900\nis it on my end?\n\n142\n00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.110\nIs it on their end?\n\n143\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.557\nThis is helping indicate that\nMicrosoft seems to be up and running,\n\n144\n00:07:47.557 --> 00:07:50.712\nthat means the trouble lies\nsomewhere between us or at my end.\n\n145\n00:07:50.712 --> 00:07:54.710\n>> Right, if we are still having that\nconnectivity issue where we don't know\n\n146\n00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.033\nwhat's going on, we can trouble shoot\nthis in a couple of different ways right?\n\n147\n00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:02.868\nIf it's on my end, I just go to a machine\nthat's actually within my domain and\n\n148\n00:08:02.868 --> 00:08:06.070\nsee if I can connect to those services,\nright?\n\n149\n00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.470\nOffice 365 is reporting that they're good,\nbut did we check everything on our end?\n\n150\n00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.450\nIf we did, then it's somewhere in between,\n\n151\n00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.740\nwe jump on to another machine that's\nconnected to another network out there,\n\n152\n00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.410\nsee if we can still connect, and if we\nstill can't connect, there probably is\n\n153\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.190\ngonna be some type of connectivity\nissue in between here and there.\n\n154\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.060\nNow, before we're actually done with this,\n\n155\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.090\neven though that's actually a very\nhelpful tool, it's not enough some times.\n\n156\n00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.200\nSo let's go back and take a look here.\n\n157\n00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.400\nAs we see that there's actually a nice,\nneat link down here too.\n\n158\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.490\nWhich is View Details and\nHistory and I'm gonna try and oop.\n\n159\n00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:37.990\nLet me see.\n\n160\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.940\nI'm not sure if I could zoom in and\nclick on that or not.\n\n161\n00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:46.570\nAnd I'll zoom back out just for\na moment, and see something else, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:52.225\nSo, even though I get a nice, graphical\nrepresentation of a summary of things,\n\n163\n00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:55.550\nI just wanna make sure try and\nget this big enough so we can see,\n\n164\n00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.570\njust a little bit here, and I'm gonna go,\nand, yeah, zoom in like that.\n\n165\n00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.210\nOkay?\n\n166\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.490\nSo, notice that I can see it from the top,\nthey, they now have it, alphabetically,\n\n167\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.310\nI was trying to make sure I said it right.\n\n168\n00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.220\nSo, exchange online is at top,\nidentity service,\n\n169\n00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.460\nmobile device manager,\noffice portal You name it.\n\n170\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.260\nYou can see that it actually gives you\nabout a week's time period there, right?\n\n171\n00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.730\nSeven days of how the operational\nservice health is.\n\n172\n00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.070\nAnd I can tell you that sometime\non January 23rd and 24th, and\n\n173\n00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.980\nif I hover over it notice that it\nactually gives me another link\n\n174\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.990\nthat tells me something else may\nhave actually occurred there.\n\n175\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.930\nSo I know that email and calendar access,\nif I click on that link,\n\n176\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.670\nit will then come down and\ngive me much more detailed status.\n\n177\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:45.050\nSo if you were experiencing issues or\nif you really did need to track that, and\n\n178\n00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.160\nyou go, I didn't have time to look at it,\n\n179\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.990\nyou have at least a week's worth of\nlogs that you can go back in and go.\n\n180\n00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.000\nI do remember that.\n\n181\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.840\nI do remember that Office 365\nwas having an issue here.\n\n182\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.110\nAnd so it does give you much\nmore detailed information.\n\n183\n00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.200\nWhich is really nice.\n\n184\n00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.020\n>> That's fantastic.\n\n185\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.730\nSo if a user, especially like a remote\nuser that's not normally in the office,\n\n186\n00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.880\ncomes in on a Friday, and says hey look,\n\n187\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.680\nlast Tuesday I was having trouble\nconnecting, while I was out of my hotel.\n\n188\n00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.060\nWhat's going on?\n\n189\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.100\nI didn't look because, I didn't know\nthere was a problem, right, and\n\n190\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.420\nI can go see that history and I can say,\n\n191\n00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.720\nTuesday they were experiencing an outage,\nthat's probably what the problem was.\n\n192\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.598\n>> It really is and its a little bit more,\n\n193\n00:10:24.598 --> 00:10:28.002\nso I kind of zoomed over some of\nthe details but I want to show you kind of\n\n194\n00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:31.990\nthe breakdown of what you'll normally\nsee in these messages right here.\n\n195\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.620\nSo the first thing that you\nsee up at the top here, again,\n\n196\n00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.160\ntrying not to move too fast here,\nsays, final status.\n\n197\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.290\nEngineers have confirmed that deployment\nis complete, the issue is resolved.\n\n198\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.760\nIt even tells me if it impacts my users.\n\n199\n00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.210\nSo, this might have just been a backend\nthing, but they wanted admins like you and\n\n200\n00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.570\nme to know about it.\n\n201\n00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.284\nBut really for most of us the reason\nwe start looking here is, somebody's\n\n202\n00:10:55.284 --> 00:10:56.660\n>> [LAUGH] called and said what?\n\n203\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.140\nI can't get access.\n\n204\n00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.760\nWell did it actually affect\nmy end users at all here?\n\n205\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:08.290\nAnd if it did, customer analysis here\nas well as the primary root cause.\n\n206\n00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.420\nAnd then, if on your end what\nmay even be your next steps\n\n207\n00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.430\nif there was something that you could do?\n\n208\n00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.290\nSo on this particular issues, I don't\nbelieve there was anything that we could\n\n209\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.620\ndo, that was just a kind of a more\nof a maintenance window for them.\n\n210\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.260\nNow, I'm clicking on the back\narrow here so we can go down.\n\n211\n00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.110\nNow notice you can also view the history\nfor the past thirty days if you choose to\n\n212\n00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:32.250\ninstead and this is always good because\nhistorically, when we get issues,\n\n213\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.420\nwe don't tend to actually view the overall\nhistory and what's happening here.\n\n214\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.240\nBut sometimes when we do\na post analysis of things,\n\n215\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.900\nit's good to actually have the fact\nthat they've documented all this.\n\n216\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.850\nNow you might say, Ronnie,\nthat helps after the fact.\n\n217\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.420\nGreat.\n\n218\n00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.550\nBut am I supposed to then\ncheck this every single day?\n\n219\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.170\nYou can but\n\n220\n00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:58.440\nnotice that in the upper right hand corner\nthere is a link here for what we call RSS.\n\n221\n00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.300\nNow if you do have an RSS\nclient that you can run,\n\n222\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.970\nyou can have this actually as a feed,\nin other words a service elk.\n\n223\n00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.700\nAnd that way if you're like me you\ndaily read news, on my Android I use\n\n224\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.880\nsomething called Feedly and\nit just kind of pops up the stuff.\n\n225\n00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.230\nWell any time that I'm\nactually on my phone then,\n\n226\n00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.810\nif something does happen, it can actually\nreport to me these things directly.\n\n227\n00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.930\nSo you do have that and that is probably\none of the best recommendations there.\n\n228\n00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.120\nIf you need to keep right on top of\nit when things like that happen,\n\n229\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.260\nuse the RSS feed.\n\n230\n00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.270\nGreat thing to subscribe to.\n\n231\n00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.520\nIt does work well.\n\n232\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.950\n>> Yeah I get it right there on my phone,\nmy phone's always with me I'm gonna know.\n\n233\n00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.800\n>> Right so these tools here,\n\n234\n00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.150\nright, there's a couple more we wanna\npoint out, so let me go back here as well.\n\n235\n00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.660\nAnd you're starting to see something,\nat least I hope you are.\n\n236\n00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.370\nWhen you have a single tenant, in other\nwords, you're only responsible for\n\n237\n00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:54.220\none Office 365 account, all of the tools\nare essentially built right in for\n\n238\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.140\nyou here and you can access just\npretty much to the majority of that.\n\n239\n00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.060\nNow, notice that there's even\na little section down here for\n\n240\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.040\nessentially forecasting\nwhen things may happen.\n\n241\n00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.810\nPlan maintenance is when\nOffice 365 says look, we don't\n\n242\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.480\nthink that there's going to be anything,\nbut we do want to notify you that,\n\n243\n00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.750\nyes we are going to be working on a\nportion of the Office 365 infrastructure,\n\n244\n00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.040\nand this is when it's going to occur.\n\n245\n00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.680\nSo if you do experience slow downs,\nyou actually know about it ahead of time.\n\n246\n00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.470\nSo they are, again,\npretty good at doing that for us.\n\n247\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:34.120\nAt least in just the overall usage\nwhen we have something, okay?\n\n248\n00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.590\nNow a lot of times when\nyou can't identify and\n\n249\n00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.180\nthey do give you issues\nthat will fix everything.\n\n250\n00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:39.810\nGreat.\n\n251\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.150\nThat's what we want.\n\n252\n00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.265\nBut the very fact is\nthere's sometimes when,\n\n253\n00:13:43.265 --> 00:13:48.820\not now goes beyond the skills of even\nsuperman Mike Roderick over here,\n\n254\n00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.320\nof being able to trouble shoot and\nfix things.\n\n255\n00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.580\nAnd even people like me kind\nof muddle through it, and\n\n256\n00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.330\nwe can get through things together.\n\n257\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.070\nBut, there's times that you need help.\n\n258\n00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:03.570\nIf you do purchase an Office 365 account,\none of the features you may want to also\n\n259\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.690\ndo of course, is realized, especially the\namount of money that you're paying for.\n\n260\n00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.570\nYou should get personalized support.\n\n261\n00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.640\nAnd I mean it.\n\n262\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.610\nAnd the good thing is, you do.\n\n263\n00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.780\nAnd that's right here also,\nin this console.\n\n264\n00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.710\nSo, here in the Admin Center,\n\n265\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:20.650\nnotice that you can also issue what we\ncall a service request, as well, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.320\nSo, if I select Service Request, and\n\n267\n00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.920\nmy issue is still not resolved by anything\nthat I have tried and everything else.\n\n268\n00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.740\nThis is where you can open\nup a service request.\n\n269\n00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.550\nYou click on the plus sign, and we are not\ngoing to do it because I do not want to\n\n270\n00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.260\ndisturb them with a fake piece of data.\n\n271\n00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.640\nLet me see if I can click,\nmaybe I will have to zoom out.\n\n272\n00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.360\nWe will see if I have to zoom out here.\n\n273\n00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.680\nIt is not letting me zoom!\n\n274\n00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.230\nThere it goes, it just takes a moment.\n\n275\n00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:49.970\nHere, hold on, let me zoom out again.\n\n276\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:50.740\nI'm gonna try.\n\n277\n00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.090\nWell, maybe I am zoomed out, okay.\n\n278\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.890\nSo, let me see,\nwhere did my service request go?\n\n279\n00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.820\n>> It closed on you.\n\n280\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.525\n>> There it is, create a service request.\n\n281\n00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:01.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now notice it actually changes and\n\n282\n00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.890\nyou can do something about billing, mail,\n\n283\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.870\nsites\n>> User domains, identity managers, so\n\n284\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:12.030\nit's actually asking you to characterize\nlet's say user-domain management and\n\n285\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.910\nI will hopefully click on that.\n\n286\n00:15:17.774 --> 00:15:21.070\nAnd of course, nothing is actually\nworking, why would it be working?\n\n287\n00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.880\nA little bit slow this morning.\n\n288\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.650\nBut there it goes, so\nit's just me I'm being impatient.\n\n289\n00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:32.690\nAt this point you fill it out and they'll\nask you how they should contact you.\n\n290\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.080\nNow don't expect,\nit's on the phone right away, but\n\n291\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.490\nexpect that you will get\na service call back.\n\n292\n00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.500\nSo you do have the ability to\nalso work through a service\n\n293\n00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.490\nrequest when you need it.\n\n294\n00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.418\n>> Fantastic, Ronnie.\n\n295\n00:15:44.418 --> 00:15:47.325\nThere's all these tools but\nright in there, especially for\n\n296\n00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:50.238\nour single tenant I have access\nto all these in my admin site.\n\n297\n00:15:50.238 --> 00:15:53.958\nBut what if I have to manage\nmore than one Office 365.\n\n298\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.873\nWe've got different subscriptions, for\n\n299\n00:15:55.873 --> 00:15:58.117\ndifferent departments\nwithin my organization.\n\n300\n00:15:58.117 --> 00:15:59.727\n>> Yeah, that's a real big issue here.\n\n301\n00:15:59.727 --> 00:16:01.890\nThe very fact is when\nyou're only managing one,\n\n302\n00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.693\nyou can always go to this admin console.\n\n303\n00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:07.510\nAnd the majority of the tools, and we\nhaven't even shown you a lot of them yet.\n\n304\n00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.432\nBut at least at the beginning here,\nyou do have that ability.\n\n305\n00:16:11.432 --> 00:16:13.322\nAnd so when you have one,\nthat's the way to go.\n\n306\n00:16:13.322 --> 00:16:16.005\nBut what if you do have,\nlike what Mike was saying?\n\n307\n00:16:16.005 --> 00:16:19.855\nEach department has actually come\nup with their own Office 365 portal\n\n308\n00:16:19.855 --> 00:16:22.894\naccounts instead, in other words,\ntheir own tenancy.\n\n309\n00:16:22.894 --> 00:16:26.924\nAnd you're still actually in the IT\ndepartment, which supports all of them.\n\n310\n00:16:26.924 --> 00:16:30.695\nWell, that means you'd have to actually\nlog into each one of those different ones.\n\n311\n00:16:30.695 --> 00:16:34.328\nMake sure you remember, like, okay, which-\n>> [LAUGH] Which one were you?\n\n312\n00:16:34.328 --> 00:16:34.896\nLet's see.\n\n313\n00:16:34.896 --> 00:16:35.396\n>> Yeah, which one were you?\n\n314\n00:16:35.396 --> 00:16:35.977\nWhich one is it?\n\n315\n00:16:35.977 --> 00:16:37.730\nWhat details do I need to have?\n\n316\n00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.525\nAnd don't get me wrong,\nyou'll still have to deal with that,\n\n317\n00:16:40.525 --> 00:16:41.807\nbecause you're the IT guy.\n\n318\n00:16:41.807 --> 00:16:46.024\nBut the very fact is, if you can\nactually deal with running something\n\n319\n00:16:46.024 --> 00:16:48.860\nlike this system center\noperations manager,\n\n320\n00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.073\nyou have a much more powerful\ntool available to you.\n\n321\n00:16:52.073 --> 00:16:55.254\nAnd that is that there is an add-on\npack that you can download.\n\n322\n00:16:55.254 --> 00:17:00.244\nNow, go out to your favorite search engine\nout there and then put in a search for\n\n323\n00:17:00.244 --> 00:17:03.117\nthe Office 365 Management Pack for SCOM,\n\n324\n00:17:03.117 --> 00:17:07.892\nthe System Center Operation Manager,\nwhatever version that you're in.\n\n325\n00:17:07.892 --> 00:17:12.344\nAnd that will allow you to download\na module that will then open up, and\n\n326\n00:17:12.344 --> 00:17:16.508\nthen you can add in the tendencies\nthat you're responsible for.\n\n327\n00:17:16.508 --> 00:17:19.883\nSo you have one for the research\ndepartment, one for accounting, one for\n\n328\n00:17:19.883 --> 00:17:20.439\nwhatever.\n\n329\n00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:24.755\nYou can actually have all that in there\nand have a centralized management and\n\n330\n00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:25.774\nreporting tool.\n\n331\n00:17:25.774 --> 00:17:28.042\nAnd this is what we all hope to have.\n\n332\n00:17:28.042 --> 00:17:32.342\nIf we are actually in a large office,\nit's not that we have to run and\n\n333\n00:17:32.342 --> 00:17:37.246\nremember six different passwords here,\nbut have a single kind of unified and\n\n334\n00:17:37.246 --> 00:17:40.576\ncentralized view of what\nwe can do to troubleshoot.\n\n335\n00:17:40.576 --> 00:17:42.450\nSo do make sure that you remember that.\n\n336\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.193\nNow if you've have multiple tenants,\nyou're probably gonna look for\n\n337\n00:17:45.193 --> 00:17:46.664\nthis Office 365 Management Pack.\n\n338\n00:17:46.664 --> 00:17:47.492\nSingle tenant,\n\n339\n00:17:47.492 --> 00:17:51.642\nthe Office 365 interface right here on\nthe admin console is pretty much the key.\n\n340\n00:17:51.642 --> 00:17:52.303\n>> Very good.\n\n341\n00:17:52.303 --> 00:17:56.345\nSo larger corporation, larger environment,\nand probably you're gonna be running\n\n342\n00:17:56.345 --> 00:18:00.061\nthings like System Center Operations\nManager being one of those components.\n\n343\n00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:04.111\nSo now I've got a plugin basically, or\na module I can get to allow me to handle\n\n344\n00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:08.166\nmultiple tendencies and monitor all of\nthose from a single location without\n\n345\n00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:11.299\nhaving to log in to individual\nportals to manage each one.\n\n346\n00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:15.827\n>> It really is something that helps\nmore than you realize, I say this,\n\n347\n00:18:15.827 --> 00:18:20.720\nif you only come from a single tendency,\nwhere you're able to only single one,\n\n348\n00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.932\nyou think, well, that's great.\n\n349\n00:18:22.932 --> 00:18:25.830\nI know that I can manage\nall the other ones, too.\n\n350\n00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.500\nIt's the idea of not getting them\nconfused is pretty much the key.\n\n351\n00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.320\nWith the SCOM and that operations manager,\nit clearly helps you to delineate it and\n\n352\n00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.030\nallows you that one view.\n\n353\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.030\nYou're gonna actually work much more\ncomfortably in that, and that's something\n\n354\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.282\nthat we all have to do because remember,\nthe cloud is not going away.\n\n355\n00:18:42.282 --> 00:18:46.190\nIt's gonna become more and more complex\nas we add in more additional services.\n\n356\n00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:51.230\nThe best thing that we can do is have\nsome simplified management when we can.\n\n357\n00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.230\nAnd being able to actually\nlook at the health and\n\n358\n00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.433\nthe monitor of each one of those services\nin one view, best thing you can do.\n\n359\n00:18:56.433 --> 00:18:57.745\nIt really is.\n\n360\n00:18:57.745 --> 00:18:59.369\n>> Speaking of simplified management,\n\n361\n00:18:59.369 --> 00:19:02.730\nI know Exchange is one of those guys\nthat's really simple to manage.\n\n362\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.233\n>> It's one of the more confusing things.\n\n363\n00:19:06.233 --> 00:19:10.453\nNow, I'm not gonna say for everyone\nthat's watching this show, but for\n\n364\n00:19:10.453 --> 00:19:15.082\nthose of us that are watching this show\nand you haven't been an Exchange admin and\n\n365\n00:19:15.082 --> 00:19:19.510\nbeen managing, installing,\nuninstalling Exchange, moving mailboxes,\n\n366\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:20.830\ndoing all that stuff.\n\n367\n00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:25.073\nWell, there is a way that you can\ndo a hybrid connection between your\n\n368\n00:19:25.073 --> 00:19:28.802\non-premises Exchange server,\nas well as Office 365.\n\n369\n00:19:28.802 --> 00:19:31.527\nSo it works, and it works beautifully.\n\n370\n00:19:31.527 --> 00:19:33.627\nPeople love it when it\nactually works well.\n\n371\n00:19:33.627 --> 00:19:35.317\nBut to manage it though,\n\n372\n00:19:35.317 --> 00:19:40.401\nthere's not a single portal that says\nwe need to focus in on just Exchange.\n\n373\n00:19:40.401 --> 00:19:42.757\nAnd so what did they decide to do?\n\n374\n00:19:42.757 --> 00:19:47.566\nWell, because we can actually manage\nOffice 365 through PowerShell,\n\n375\n00:19:47.566 --> 00:19:51.476\nyou can also manage, well,\nExchange through PowerShell.\n\n376\n00:19:51.476 --> 00:19:55.567\nThere are gonna be several\nWindows PowerShell commands for\n\n377\n00:19:55.567 --> 00:19:59.835\nExchange that you're gonna use\nin that hybrid development.\n\n378\n00:19:59.835 --> 00:20:03.841\nNow that will actually give you access\nto those detailed views of both,\n\n379\n00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:06.457\nis what it will do, and\nthat's what you want.\n\n380\n00:20:06.457 --> 00:20:09.822\nNow, there is so many commands,\nI'm not gonna play around with it,\n\n381\n00:20:09.822 --> 00:20:12.201\ncuz I'm not that great\nwith Exchange myself, so\n\n382\n00:20:12.201 --> 00:20:15.470\nI'm not gonna fool you that I'm\nan Exchange admin, cuz I'm not.\n\n383\n00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.152\nBut there are.\n\n384\n00:20:17.152 --> 00:20:19.972\nThere's commands in there that will\nallow you to do better monitoring.\n\n385\n00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:23.363\nIt will allow you to be able to manage\neach mailbox if you need to, and\n\n386\n00:20:23.363 --> 00:20:24.980\nyou can even view each mailbox.\n\n387\n00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.041\nAnd there's even commands that will just\nallow you to monitor the general health\n\n388\n00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:33.294\nof your on-premises, as well as there and\nthen get a single report that comes back.\n\n389\n00:20:33.294 --> 00:20:37.423\nBut just remember that if you do\nhave that Exchange connection and\n\n390\n00:20:37.423 --> 00:20:42.305\nyou are actually working in that hybrid\ndevelopment or that hybrid state with\n\n391\n00:20:42.305 --> 00:20:47.133\nOffice 365, your management's not\ngonna be in the admin console here.\n\n392\n00:20:47.133 --> 00:20:49.303\nIt's gonna be using\nthe Windows PowerShell for\n\n393\n00:20:49.303 --> 00:20:51.208\nExchange, is what you want to remember.\n\n394\n00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:53.192\nAnd so those are key.\n\n395\n00:20:53.192 --> 00:20:57.392\nAnd if you want to look at it more,\nagain, do a search engine here and\n\n396\n00:20:57.392 --> 00:21:00.589\ntalk about\nExchange Online PowerShell commands.\n\n397\n00:21:00.589 --> 00:21:01.239\nAnd you'll see,\n\n398\n00:21:01.239 --> 00:21:04.068\nthere's probably a list of 15 to 20\ndifferent commands that you can use.\n\n399\n00:21:04.068 --> 00:21:08.408\nAnd each one is gonna be specific to\na context, so more than anything,\n\n400\n00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:13.410\nif we tend to see any of those commands,\nit's gonna be in a later show, not in this\n\n401\n00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:18.513\nparticular series, but in another series,\nwhich is gonna be the 70-347.\n\n402\n00:21:18.513 --> 00:21:22.495\nI was trying to remember,\nthe other show that actually says,\n\n403\n00:21:22.495 --> 00:21:26.647\nhere's how we connect those\nthings actually to Office 365.\n\n404\n00:21:26.647 --> 00:21:29.434\nBut if you're actually managing,\nand you need to, you do know,\n\n405\n00:21:29.434 --> 00:21:32.679\nthat if you have to troubleshoot things\nlike Exchange, working together,\n\n406\n00:21:32.679 --> 00:21:35.337\nit's gonna have to be done\nthrough the PowerShell commands.\n\n407\n00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:38.139\n>> PowerShell's fantastic,\nit's very modular, and\n\n408\n00:21:38.139 --> 00:21:42.123\nso you just have to make sure you get\nthose commands and get those modules, so\n\n409\n00:21:42.123 --> 00:21:44.195\nyou can manage Exchange, fantastic.\n\n410\n00:21:44.195 --> 00:21:47.724\nCuz I know, with my limited experience\nwith Exchange, there were some things\n\n411\n00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.944\nthat you cannot do through the console,\nthrough the GUI, what I like.\n\n412\n00:21:50.944 --> 00:21:54.289\nYou're looking around, you're clicking on\nthings, you're trying to find out where\n\n413\n00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:57.289\nyou can do it, and you find out the only\nway you can do it is through PowerShell.\n\n414\n00:21:57.289 --> 00:22:00.963\nSo get used to working with PowerShell,\nwatch those episodes that are coming up if\n\n415\n00:22:00.963 --> 00:22:03.749\nyou need to manage your\nExchange Online through PowerShell.\n\n416\n00:22:03.749 --> 00:22:07.663\n>> And that's actually a great\npiece of advice, regardless.\n\n417\n00:22:07.663 --> 00:22:11.239\nIf you're gonna be a Microsoft admin\ntoday, there is no way for you to go,\n\n418\n00:22:11.239 --> 00:22:15.184\n[SOUND] I'm not gonna worry about learning\nany PowerShell, I don't need any it.\n\n419\n00:22:15.184 --> 00:22:19.153\nYou're gonna see that as\nthe future continues to move on,\n\n420\n00:22:19.153 --> 00:22:23.851\nand because of the integration\nbetween on-premises and the cloud,\n\n421\n00:22:23.851 --> 00:22:28.225\nthat more and more of it is gonna\nend up relying on PowerShell, so\n\n422\n00:22:28.225 --> 00:22:30.817\nnow is not the time to run away from it.\n\n423\n00:22:30.817 --> 00:22:32.896\nNow is the time to learn\na little bit more about it.\n\n424\n00:22:32.896 --> 00:22:36.648\nAnd you will actually learn more\nas you willingly step in and\n\n425\n00:22:36.648 --> 00:22:38.456\ndeal with those issues too.\n\n426\n00:22:38.456 --> 00:22:40.220\n>> Very good.\nAll right, now, Ronnie,\n\n427\n00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.143\nI know we've gotta have some\nreporting capabilities in here.\n\n428\n00:22:43.143 --> 00:22:46.837\nOne of the things I love to do when I'm\nmanaging services like this is I like to\n\n429\n00:22:46.837 --> 00:22:49.838\nget reports back, cuz usually I\nhave to go to the higher ups and\n\n430\n00:22:49.838 --> 00:22:53.278\nshow them something, and\nthey don't want to see the nitty gritties.\n\n431\n00:22:53.278 --> 00:22:55.238\nThey want nice, pretty, formatted reports.\n\n432\n00:22:55.238 --> 00:22:56.028\nDo we have those capabilities?\n\n433\n00:22:56.028 --> 00:22:59.048\n>> You have more reports in here\nthan you can actually realize.\n\n434\n00:22:59.048 --> 00:23:00.429\nAnd that is the key.\n\n435\n00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:03.941\nReports, even though they're good for\nyou, they are really to help you to\n\n436\n00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:07.652\nmake sure that you can make your case to\nwhoever it actually needs to be made to.\n\n437\n00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:10.856\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the reporting feature here.\n\n438\n00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:12.318\nAnd we're not gonna spend\na ton of time in this.\n\n439\n00:23:12.318 --> 00:23:17.844\nBut in the Office 365 Admin Center,\nif I go over to the left-hand side\n\n440\n00:23:17.844 --> 00:23:23.290\nin the navigation tree, I can click\non the link here that says Reports.\n\n441\n00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:27.920\nAnd now you see that they've\nactually broken them down into,\n\n442\n00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.490\nwell, different categories,\nif you want to.\n\n443\n00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:36.839\nSo right up here, there's actually\nthe one for Mail, Usage, again,\n\n444\n00:23:36.839 --> 00:23:41.831\nlike we talked about, Skype,\nSharePoint, let me zoom back out so\n\n445\n00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:46.644\nthat I can use the scroll bar,\nAuditing, Protection, Rules,\n\n446\n00:23:46.644 --> 00:23:51.850\nDLP, you name it, the data Link\nprotection or something like that.\n\n447\n00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.230\nSo here's one for things like the mailbox.\n\n448\n00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:59.627\nIf I wanna see the mailbox usage, in other\nwords, how big our mailbox is getting or\n\n449\n00:23:59.627 --> 00:24:03.036\nare they actually being used,\nI simply click on the link here.\n\n450\n00:24:03.036 --> 00:24:04.950\nI should have only one or two-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n451\n00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:06.500\n>> Shouldn't be very many.\n\n452\n00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.890\nSo I have total of 30 here,\nis what I have, and so you\n\n453\n00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:17.340\nsee that it's not really being you know,\noverly used at that particular point.\n\n454\n00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.253\nBut there are some other neat things,\n\n455\n00:24:20.253 --> 00:24:23.997\nwell maybe if I can get\nback to the right one here.\n\n456\n00:24:23.997 --> 00:24:26.194\nIf you, where did I go?\n\n457\n00:24:26.194 --> 00:24:29.178\nThere it is,\nI had to scroll down to reports.\n\n458\n00:24:29.178 --> 00:24:33.090\nI like the usage section\nhere if I can get to it.\n\n459\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:37.000\nUnder the usage section if I want to see\nwhat the operating systems that are being\n\n460\n00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.590\nused to connect in Office 365,\nyou can see right here 27 to 12.\n\n461\n00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.860\nMac OS here on the right-hand side,\nWindows over there.\n\n462\n00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.720\nAnd that can help me to balance out maybe\nif I'm experiencing more issues with what\n\n463\n00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.950\nMac users than I am with Windows users,\nokay?\n\n464\n00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.940\nSo there's a lot of\ndifferent reports here.\n\n465\n00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.960\nYou should take the time to\ntake a look at these, right?\n\n466\n00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.300\nIf you're preparing for the exam,\nmake sure you go back in.\n\n467\n00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.130\nAnd that's the key.\n\n468\n00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:02.780\nGo back in and\n\n469\n00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.930\ntake a look at these reports,\nknow where they're gonna be located.\n\n470\n00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.290\nI could sit here and\nshow you every single one of them,\n\n471\n00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:13.510\nbut, if you developed your own at this\npoint, you can look at your own and\n\n472\n00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.340\nas you understand what\nthe statistics really mean.\n\n473\n00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.450\nBut just realize that these reports\nare actually there for you,\n\n474\n00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.960\nand they really can help you to\nmake the point that you need to.\n\n475\n00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.450\nIf you are having to migrate\nto new equipment or not, or\n\n476\n00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.100\nneeding to change some services.\n\n477\n00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.220\nSo all of these reports are really good.\n\n478\n00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.790\nThose are fantastic you know.\n\n479\n00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:36.580\nAs an IT ad man, or managing this, we're\nalways tasked with going into meetings,\n\n480\n00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.850\nand the C-level people\nare gonna be asking questions.\n\n481\n00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.740\nWhy are we spending money on this, or\nis it worthwhile, what's our usage,\n\n482\n00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.940\nthings like that.\n\n483\n00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.630\nAnd Microsoft gives me the ability\nto generate those reports\n\n484\n00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:51.710\nwithout having to do a lot of\nresearch myself, right, and\n\n485\n00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.780\ntrack it manually or\nindividually on each one of those users.\n\n486\n00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.750\nI can go in there, run a report, print it\nout, walk into that meeting, hand it over,\n\n487\n00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:59.570\nit looks good.\n\n488\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.640\nFormatted reports are always nice,\n\n489\n00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.330\nespecially when they're making them for\nus.\n\n490\n00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.617\n[LAUGH] So-\n>> They really are.\n\n491\n00:26:04.617 --> 00:26:06.217\nYeah, good stuff there.\n\n492\n00:26:06.217 --> 00:26:08.328\n>> All right Ronnie,\nnow I know before the show,\n\n493\n00:26:08.328 --> 00:26:10.937\nwe were talking about some\nother tools that we could use.\n\n494\n00:26:10.937 --> 00:26:14.146\nWhen we're working with what\nMicrosoft provides for us that are,\n\n495\n00:26:14.146 --> 00:26:17.870\nnot outside of Office 365, but kind of\non separate pages where we can go and\n\n496\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.910\ntroubleshoot connectivity issues and\nthings like that?\n\n497\n00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:21.970\n>> There really are and so\n\n498\n00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:26.200\nthis is why if you are that single tenant\nadministrator it really does help you out.\n\n499\n00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.315\nBecause all those tools are not only\nbuilt-in right there but there are some of\n\n500\n00:26:30.315 --> 00:26:34.567\ncourse that you can actually also learn\nabout as well, that really help you out.\n\n501\n00:26:34.567 --> 00:26:38.387\nSo there is an Office 365 trouble shooter.\n\n502\n00:26:38.387 --> 00:26:42.775\nNow when I talk about that, there's\nactually link up here that we are trying\n\n503\n00:26:42.775 --> 00:26:44.900\nto include in some of the notes here so\n\n504\n00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.168\nthat donâ€™t go you know like my gosh\nI canâ€™t read what that link is here.\n\n505\n00:26:49.168 --> 00:26:52.501\nBut there is, and\nthis is a DIY troubleshooter so\n\n506\n00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:54.788\ndo it yourself troubleshooter.\n\n507\n00:26:54.788 --> 00:26:59.047\nIf you don't really want to try and make\na direct connection, you can come here and\n\n508\n00:26:59.047 --> 00:27:01.980\nthen you select the issue\nthat you're having.\n\n509\n00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:07.170\nSo let's say I'm actually having a problem\nwith the Office 365 client subscriptions.\n\n510\n00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:11.570\nI simply select that, and then what\nservice area I'm actually dealing with.\n\n511\n00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:18.850\nAnd then let's say it's about\nthe Office for Windows Installation.\n\n512\n00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.520\nAnd notice how it keeps filling in and\ngiving me more boxes to select.\n\n513\n00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.620\nAnd then in the end it's gonna leave me\neither with a specific set of help, okay?\n\n514\n00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.086\nSo if I select that, How to install,\nInstallation error or problem,\n\n515\n00:27:31.086 --> 00:27:32.158\nOffice deployment.\n\n516\n00:27:32.158 --> 00:27:35.570\nAnd if it doesn't, it will normally leave\nme with a bunch of tech net articles.\n\n517\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:36.430\nIt really will, or\n\n518\n00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:40.670\nsome type of the social forums articles\nthat are there to help you out.\n\n519\n00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:44.940\nSo that itself is actually\na great way to begin to isolate\n\n520\n00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.420\nsome of the issues that you\ndo have available to you.\n\n521\n00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.190\nNow some of the other ones that are also\nout there, and here's the other one.\n\n522\n00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.640\nOnce again, we'll provide a link for\nthis in our show as well.\n\n523\n00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.680\nWill they really help you with tools and\ndiagnostics.\n\n524\n00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.045\nAnd it begins by you selecting\nwhat plan that you're actually on.\n\n525\n00:28:02.045 --> 00:28:07.940\nAd then you can see what tools\nare actually available for you, that\n\n526\n00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:13.060\nmay not actually have been immediately\nembedded into the admin console.\n\n527\n00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.440\nSo there's a lot of additional tools that\nyou might find based on your subscription\n\n528\n00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:25.010\nwhere you don't have some\nof those tools there for\n\n529\n00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:30.130\nyou, you may actually be able to look here\nand figure that one out as well, okay?\n\n530\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.750\nNow, there's a couple of\ntools based on connectivity.\n\n531\n00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.600\nWhen somebody says that they're not able\nto connect from inside your organization,\n\n532\n00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.570\nthere is a website that you can go to.\n\n533\n00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:45.370\nAnd notice this says the Microsoft\nRemote Connectivity Analyzer.\n\n534\n00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.430\nYou may see it abbreviated as RCA, okay?\n\n535\n00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:51.630\nSo if you see this,\nthis tool has been around a long,\n\n536\n00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.390\nlong time, okay and\nI mean really long time.\n\n537\n00:28:55.390 --> 00:29:00.750\nAnd you actually see that it's got so\nmany tools that are embedded in it.\n\n538\n00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:05.480\nSo this one you can run from anywhere and\nany web site that you want to and\n\n539\n00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.030\nbe able to test out your\nparticular connection.\n\n540\n00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.340\nSo you're actually testing out Exchange.\n\n541\n00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:10.927\nYou can do that.\n\n542\n00:29:10.927 --> 00:29:13.090\nNotice, actually gives\nyou all the tests here,\n\n543\n00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.810\nif you're doing this with Exchange online.\n\n544\n00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.460\nIf you're running link right,\nthe communication software,\n\n545\n00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.850\nyou can do the same thing.\n\n546\n00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.800\nLook, here it is with Office 365.\n\n547\n00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:29.530\nSo, you can even see that, if you had\ngeneral tests on it, and let's say that,\n\n548\n00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:33.460\nthere's that single sign on test that\nwe wanted to run, something like that.\n\n549\n00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.120\nAnd we can do the domain\nserver connectivity test.\n\n550\n00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.090\nAnd I just tried to do one that\nactually will work very quickly here.\n\n551\n00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.960\nSo, let me go ahead and do this.\n\n552\n00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.100\nAnd I'll select my ITProTV demo.\n\n553\n00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.600\nAnd then you have to verify\nthat you're not a robot.\n\n554\n00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.172\nAnd let's see if I can do that.\n\n555\n00:29:50.172 --> 00:29:50.950\n[LAUGH]\n>> I\n\n556\n00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.150\ndon't like those tests cuz\nthey always say I'm a robot.\n\n557\n00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.868\n>> Yeah, I know, isn't it weird?\n\n558\n00:29:54.868 --> 00:29:55.781\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n559\n00:29:55.781 --> 00:29:57.740\nwe're about to see here whether or\nnot I'm a robot.\n\n560\n00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.040\nNope, I get green which means good.\n\n561\n00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.890\nAnd then I perform a test.\n\n562\n00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.850\nSo, if I wanted to check if\nmy DNS records were setup for\n\n563\n00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:09.650\nOffice 365 correctly I could\nactually do that, and there we go.\n\n564\n00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.690\nWe have a, test successful,\nso that's good.\n\n565\n00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.385\nThat means I actually did set-up something\n\n566\n00:30:14.385 --> 00:30:15.330\ncorrectly-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n567\n00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:19.170\n>> During this show, so not exactly bad,\n\n568\n00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.200\nand it actually tells you the steps that\nit took to go through and verify that.\n\n569\n00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.430\nBut if you are having problems\nmaking the connectivity,\n\n570\n00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.960\nmaking that work, you can use this.\n\n571\n00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.750\nNow on the other side of this,\n\n572\n00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:34.280\nif you go I don't like the web pages, is\nthere a client tool that I can download?\n\n573\n00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.460\nThere is\na Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer, an MCA.\n\n574\n00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:44.630\nNot the RCA, but the MCA that you\ncan download onto a Windows machine,\n\n575\n00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:48.940\nand you can actually go into\nthe admin console, select tools, and\n\n576\n00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.010\nactually download it from that link,\nI believe.\n\n577\n00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.780\nAnd then when you do so,\nit will run some of the same tests.\n\n578\n00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.620\nIt won't be as feature rich as the RCA.\n\n579\n00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.637\nIt doesn't give you everything.\n\n580\n00:31:00.637 --> 00:31:04.710\nIt would give you some limited, but you'll\nactually be able to use some of those\n\n581\n00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.740\nconnectivities test to help you out there.\n\n582\n00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.300\nBut it has to run from Windows machine.\n\n583\n00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.258\nThat Windows machine has to be\nrunning that dot net framework\n\n584\n00:31:12.258 --> 00:31:15.620\n3.5 I believe Is the right one.\n\n585\n00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.450\nBut the good thing is it will tell you,\nright?\n\n586\n00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.240\nIf you go and try to install it,\nit goes hey you're not running this,\n\n587\n00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.890\nmake sure you install that\npre-requisite is pretty much the key.\n\n588\n00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:23.920\n>> Fantastic,\n\n589\n00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.130\nthese are great tools because what if\nI'm having trouble connecting, right?\n\n590\n00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.920\nThat admin site has a lot of\ngreat tools built into it, so\n\n591\n00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.540\nif I can connect to that, I can use those.\n\n592\n00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.270\nBut what if the problem is on their end,\nI'm having trouble actually connecting.\n\n593\n00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.907\nOr it might not be another end but\nI'm still having trouble connecting.\n\n594\n00:31:39.907 --> 00:31:43.387\nI can't get to my admin site to get to\nthose tools that I want to use to do\n\n595\n00:31:43.387 --> 00:31:44.588\nthe trouble shooting.\n\n596\n00:31:44.588 --> 00:31:49.615\nThese are outside of that Office 365 log\nin which is sometimes very, very handy.\n\n597\n00:31:49.615 --> 00:31:52.443\n>> And, Ronnie, I know there is\none more that you wanna show us?.\n\n598\n00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:55.379\n>> I do, I was just making cuz,\nof course, like anything else,\n\n599\n00:31:55.379 --> 00:31:57.192\nit was something that I had to type in.\n\n600\n00:31:57.192 --> 00:31:58.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which it mean it could work.\n\n601\n00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.020\nIt may not work here, but\nwe will see right here in a moment.\n\n602\n00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.093\nSo there is one more tool out here,\nespecially when you are gonna be in\n\n603\n00:32:06.093 --> 00:32:10.817\na hybrid environment and that is what we\ncall the free and busy troubleshooter.\n\n604\n00:32:10.817 --> 00:32:15.080\nNow when we do this, this is something\nthat you can actually launch and\n\n605\n00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.994\na lot of us use like a the free and busy\ntroubleshooting inside of our own Outlook,\n\n606\n00:32:19.994 --> 00:32:25.370\nthe calendar feature to prove that we're\nfree, we're busy and stuff like that.\n\n607\n00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.818\nSometimes, it doesn't work\nthe way that we think it does.\n\n608\n00:32:27.818 --> 00:32:31.985\nAnd apparently, people absolutely hate\nit when it doesn't work that way.\n\n609\n00:32:31.985 --> 00:32:35.971\nSo it's one of the tools that they really\ndo call out on the exam objectives,\n\n610\n00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:40.233\nthat's why I want to mention it here, but\nwe will also put a link in here for this.\n\n611\n00:32:40.233 --> 00:32:43.460\nIt's not the easiest tool\nin the world to find.\n\n612\n00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.130\nI guarantee, you'll look on\nmany different links there and\n\n613\n00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.810\nit won't lead you to this one and\nthen you'll be right here.\n\n614\n00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.962\nSo there is a troubleshooting free and\n\n615\n00:32:50.962 --> 00:32:54.130\nbusy issue in an Exchange\nhybrid environment.\n\n616\n00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:58.820\nSo if you're in a hybrid environment where\nyou're running on-premises as well as\n\n617\n00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:03.510\nOffice 365, this is the tool that you want\nto use if that feature is not working.\n\n618\n00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.942\nSo, it's kind of weird.\n\n619\n00:33:05.942 --> 00:33:09.067\nIt almost looks like from Microsoft's\nside that it's kind of telling you.\n\n620\n00:33:09.067 --> 00:33:11.859\nYeah, we don't have a tool\nwe're just explaining the tool.\n\n621\n00:33:11.859 --> 00:33:15.011\nBut as you scroll on down like\nI'm doing here, the reason\n\n622\n00:33:15.011 --> 00:33:19.359\nwhy we're not gonna run it estimated\ntime of completion 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n623\n00:33:19.359 --> 00:33:24.692\nYeah, we're not gonna run this tool during\nour show here, but I did want you to see.\n\n624\n00:33:24.692 --> 00:33:26.900\nIt gives you the step by step things.\n\n625\n00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.870\nWelcome to that hybrid environment.\n\n626\n00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.170\nWhat is actually gonna be your setup?\n\n627\n00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.048\nAnd then once you do that,\nyou continue to click Submit and\n\n628\n00:33:34.048 --> 00:33:37.651\nit actually continues on and\nyou actually answer a few other questions.\n\n629\n00:33:37.651 --> 00:33:40.910\nFrom that point,\nit will help you to resolve those issues.\n\n630\n00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.234\nSo remember that the problem\nwe have in the hybrid.\n\n631\n00:33:43.234 --> 00:33:47.526\nCould be on Exchange Online side, could be\non your side, could be the client's side.\n\n632\n00:33:47.526 --> 00:33:52.018\nSo it's gonna help point out which one of\nthose is actually gonna be your bottleneck\n\n633\n00:33:52.018 --> 00:33:55.817\nissue at that point or your causing issue,\nwhatever we call it there.\n\n634\n00:33:55.817 --> 00:33:58.401\nSo, just realize that\nthere are some like that.\n\n635\n00:33:58.401 --> 00:34:02.166\nNow there's other tools, because Office\n365 hooks in with Link and Yammer that\n\n636\n00:34:02.166 --> 00:34:05.528\nare out there and you just have to\nactually investigate a little bit more.\n\n637\n00:34:05.528 --> 00:34:07.799\nYou'll see that there's\na link troubleshooter,\n\n638\n00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:10.140\njust like we showed you\nin the RCA as well.\n\n639\n00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:10.773\nBut remember,\n\n640\n00:34:10.773 --> 00:34:13.651\nyour goal is not just go, okay,\nRonnie said that these are the tools.\n\n641\n00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:17.294\nYou need to explore these tools,\nbecause we've just shown you,\n\n642\n00:34:17.294 --> 00:34:20.820\nwe've scratched the surface of\nthat rub off game card for you.\n\n643\n00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.720\nWe're saying, here,\ntake a look at this and\n\n644\n00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.330\nthat means you absolutely need\nto take a look at these things.\n\n645\n00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.901\n>> Fantastic stuff, Ronnie.\n\n646\n00:34:26.901 --> 00:34:30.792\nA lot of larger organizations and\nsmall ones as well, but\n\n647\n00:34:30.792 --> 00:34:33.151\nI see it mostly in the bigger ones.\n\n648\n00:34:33.151 --> 00:34:36.974\nThey really rely on that free and busy,\nbecause I have got to get with certain\n\n649\n00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:39.985\npeople and they are in other locations,\nother time zones.\n\n650\n00:34:39.985 --> 00:34:43.532\nAnd I have got to be able to look at that\ncalendar, see if they are available for\n\n651\n00:34:43.532 --> 00:34:45.223\na conference call or what have you and\n\n652\n00:34:45.223 --> 00:34:49.010\nwe start spreading our environment out\nto local and out there in the cloud.\n\n653\n00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.045\nIt gets pretty complex\ntrying to manage that.\n\n654\n00:34:50.045 --> 00:34:51.055\nFantastic.\n\n655\n00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:55.859\nWe had a good tool specifically\nto troubleshoot that feature.\n\n656\n00:34:55.859 --> 00:34:56.628\nGreat look, Ronnie,\n\n657\n00:34:56.628 --> 00:34:58.901\nat all the different trouble\nshooting capabilities that we have.\n\n658\n00:34:58.901 --> 00:35:03.162\nMonitoring as well as troubleshooting,\nour Office 365 as well as a hybrid type\n\n659\n00:35:03.162 --> 00:35:06.436\nenvironment where we've got\nsome of it running on-premise,\n\n660\n00:35:06.436 --> 00:35:08.185\nsome of it out there in the cloud.\n\n661\n00:35:08.185 --> 00:35:10.360\nWe appreciate that, great examples.\n\n662\n00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.809\nHope everybody out there enjoyed this\nepisode, that's going to do it for\n\n663\n00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:14.317\nthis one.\n\n664\n00:35:14.317 --> 00:35:16.190\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n665\n00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.283\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n666\n00:35:17.283 --> 00:35:20.276\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n667\n00:35:20.276 --> 00:35:20.776\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
