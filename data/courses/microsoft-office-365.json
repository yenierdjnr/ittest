covering\n\n3\n00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.990\nthe 70-346 exam Managing Office\n365 Identities and Requirements.\n\n4\n00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.500\nHere to tell us a little bit more about\nwhat we can expect out of these videos\n\n5\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.480\nHere's the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.440\n>> Well thank you Mike\nas we continue on and\n\n7\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.310\ntaking a look at getting\ncertified in Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.340\nThat's where we are beginning right?\n\n9\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.450\nThere's an exam that covers the material\nthat we're actually going to be taking\n\n10\n00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.150\na look at and that is the exam labeled\nas 70-346 For what Mike was saying.\n\n11\n00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.510\nAnd let me show you the official\nexam page here, and\n\n12\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.360\nthat way we'll be able to see\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n13\n00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.680\nSo here on the website itself,\nthe MCSA part 1 exam 70-346 office 365.\n\n14\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.250\nAnd this is part one of the MCSA, so\n\n15\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.110\nthere's another series that's\ngonna be coming down the road.\n\n16\n00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.120\nBut this is the first in line\nthat you need to be familiar with\n\n17\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.780\nas you continue on towards your MCSA.\n\n18\n00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.610\nNow when we take a look at this, remember\nthat if you are in the United States,\n\n19\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.925\nthis exam is gonna cost you about 150.\n\n20\n00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:18.495\nDollars, and you will go ahead and sign\nup through whatever the exam center is.\n\n21\n00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.475\nSo make sure you take a look at that page.\n\n22\n00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:22.915\nYou can do your favorite search,\nand it will lead you right here.\n\n23\n00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:24.955\nIf you'll just search for\nthat exam number.\n\n24\n00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:27.416\nExam number 70-346.\n\n25\n00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.145\nNow as we take a look at this series,\n\n26\n00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.220\nthere's a couple of things that\nyou want to keep in mind here.\n\n27\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.200\nThis is not an exam for beginners and this\nis not saying that you cannot attempt it,\n\n28\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.660\nbut if you'll notice that they even tell\nyou some of the things you should be\n\n29\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.740\nfamiliar with if you are actually planning\nto take this particular exam here.\n\n30\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.130\nLet me go back to that webpage.\n\n31\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.900\nSo there it is.\n\n32\n00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.280\nThere's actually gonna be familiarity with\nOffice 365, the administration center\n\n33\n00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.760\nitself, as well as having an understanding\nof basic Microsoft Exchange Online,\n\n34\n00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.570\nSkype for Business Online,\nSharePoint Online, Office 365 Pro Plus,\n\n35\n00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.930\nin other words, their subscription As\nwell as basic Azure Active Directory.\n\n36\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.260\nAnd you wanna make sure that you do\nunderstand these fairly well before you\n\n37\n00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.370\nsit down for that exam.\n\n38\n00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.040\nAnd that's a basis requirement of\nwhat we're actually going to see.\n\n39\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.050\nSo there is some assumed knowledge as we\ngo throughout this pick or class as well.\n\n40\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.630\nNow what we're gonna focus in on,\nof course, are these exam objective areas.\n\n41\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.100\nAnd they've broken up into\nsix different areas for us.\n\n42\n00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.610\nSo the first thing that we\nfocus in on will be, of course,\n\n43\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.870\njust understanding how do we provision\nOffice 365 to work with our network,\n\n44\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.410\nand getting ready ready for that.\n\n45\n00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.740\nIf you haven't set it up,\n\n46\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.820\nwe show you the basics here of\nunderstanding how to get a tenant.\n\n47\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.630\nAnd then, how does that connect in with\nyour current on-premises active directory?\n\n48\n00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.140\nAnd we show you how to configure and\nadd that and begin to plan your own pilot.\n\n49\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.510\nThe way that they move through\noffice 365 is that they want you to\n\n50\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.180\nmove from the very fact of\na practice type of network,\n\n51\n00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.110\nall the way into a production very\nquickly by setting it up for you.\n\n52\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.600\nAs you;re actually practicing,\nyou're setting up for\n\n53\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.310\nproduction at the same time.\n\n54\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.350\nSo that's what they talk about\nin planning a pilot, and\n\n55\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.500\nwe go through that step by step.\n\n56\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.540\nThen we continue to move on\nthrough the content here,\n\n57\n00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.300\nby making sure that you understand that\nbasic networking has to be established\n\n58\n00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.520\nbetween your network on premise as\nwell as the Office 365 network.\n\n59\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.620\nAnd we talk about making sure that you\nunderstand how to configure your DNS to\n\n60\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.180\nwork with it as well as ensuring then\nthat you do have the client connectivity.\n\n61\n00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.450\nConnecting through a proxy\nserver if you need to and\n\n62\n00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.180\nfirewall issues that\nhave to be done as well.\n\n63\n00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.960\nThen of course,\nthere's rights management issues.\n\n64\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.870\nNo longer are you just protecting data and\n\n65\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.530\ndocuments that are actually\nwithin your network anymore.\n\n66\n00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.090\nNow that you're actually connecting\nonline there maybe rights management that\n\n67\n00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.570\nyou actually can deal with.\n\n68\n00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.240\nSo that even if those documents leave\n\n69\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.510\nyour own network that you still have the\nability to make that document protected,\n\n70\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.960\nand we talk about the basics here too.\n\n71\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.560\nThe other thing of course is understand\nthere's different rolls in managing office\n\n72\n00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.640\n365, we show you not only how\nto configure those rolls, but\n\n73\n00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.810\nwhat those rolls actually help us to do,\nand why we need them.\n\n74\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.040\nTo be able to separate out roles\nsuch as a tenant administrator\n\n75\n00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.890\nversus a password administrator and\neven some that are actually in between.\n\n76\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.730\nAnd we'll take a look at\neach one of those as well.\n\n77\n00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.210\nWe also of course go into\nmanaging our identities and\n\n78\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.330\nthis is about of course users.\n\n79\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.770\nWhat happens to the user?\n\n80\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.660\nAs we are now actually connected not only\nto the on-premise active directory, but\n\n81\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.020\nnow also into our cloud service\nthat we have to worry about and\n\n82\n00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.890\nhow do we get those\nconnections made right.\n\n83\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.670\nHow do we import users into the office\n365 management as we need to?\n\n84\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.470\nAnd then of course one of the most\npowerful tools that's out there\n\n85\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.120\nis going to be that windows powershell for\n\n86\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.610\noffice 365 that will allow us to go ahead\nand set up the connections that we need.\n\n87\n00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.220\nAnd even managed some of\nthe online on Office 365.\n\n88\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.450\nOf course,\nthen we also continue on to take a look,\n\n89\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.590\nnow, at what we call active\ndirectory synchronization.\n\n90\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.480\nThis is when you decide that you\nare now going through your pilot.\n\n91\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.880\nAnd now you want\na synchronization to happen.\n\n92\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.430\nSo that when you create an account on your\non premise active directory, it now also\n\n93\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.640\nappears and syncs up to, your active\ndirectory that's actually even behind\n\n94\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.810\nMicrosoft, there in the Azure cloud,\nas well, that's supporting Office 365.\n\n95\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.750\nAnd we'll walk through that\nstep by step as well, and\n\n96\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.060\nshow you how to sync, synchronize\nthose two directories together.\n\n97\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.350\nAnd then, of course, we get into one of\nthe major parts here that most people\n\n98\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.370\ndon't tend to implement, which is\ngonna be the idea of single sign-on.\n\n99\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.910\nNow that you have the actual single\nsign-on, or the things in place for\n\n100\n00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.070\nsingle sign-on,\n\n101\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.850\nyou're gonna also need to establish things\nlike Active Directory Federation Services,\n\n102\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.260\nso that now you actually present a single\nset of credentials, regardless of whether\n\n103\n00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.250\nyou're logging on to Office 365 Or\nwhether you're actually logging into\n\n104\n00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.880\nyour on-premises Active Directory network,\nwe show you how to plan that out and\n\n105\n00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.150\nunderstand the planning of\nthe Active Directory Federation services.\n\n106\n00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.130\nWe install the role, we configure it.\n\n107\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.795\nAnd we even add in a proxy server if\nyou're gonna have users from outside your\n\n108\n00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:25.630\non-premises active directory connecting\ninto both of those services as well.\n\n109\n00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.980\nAnd then lastly, of course, but\n\n110\n00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.330\nnot least by any comparison, we take\na look at monitoring and troubleshooting.\n\n111\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.730\nThese are some of the most intuitive tools\nthat we have in the online service for us,\n\n112\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.290\nbecause they pack them directly into the\nadmin center inside of the dashboard, so\n\n113\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.160\nthat we can access them easily.\n\n114\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.780\nThat way we know if there is\nactually issues going on with\n\n115\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.830\nOffice 365 online or is there something\nI need to trouble shoot here.\n\n116\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.250\nAnd if it's not in either place\nthen it's somewhere in-between.\n\n117\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.390\nThere are so many tools that are out there\nthat allows us to monitor it this stuff.\n\n118\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.500\nIt is very much an advantage\nas an office 365\n\n119\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.100\nadministrator needs to know them so that\nthey can actually go ahead and streamline.\n\n120\n00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.000\nWhat they need to do all the things\nthat they need to be able to manage\n\n121\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.230\nboth as well.\n\n122\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.210\nDon't forget to take advantage of some\nof the things that are also built in for\n\n123\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.280\nyou, since you do pay for\nthe Office 365 subscription at some time,\n\n124\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.310\nas you are actually going to\nimplement this into your network.\n\n125\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.320\nYou also have access, of course,\nto being able to open a service and\n\n126\n00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.720\nsupport ticket that gives you now direct\naccess to Office 365 support team too.\n\n127\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.390\nAnd the whole goal is to be able\nto isolate, just like we said.\n\n128\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.120\nIs it Office 365 issue?\n\n129\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.350\nIs it our own issue here?\n\n130\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.820\nIt isolates and then that way we\ncan troubleshoot where we need to.\n\n131\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.910\nSo if you are trying to get ready for\nthe exam 70-346, this series\n\n132\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.460\nwill cover all the objectives that you\nneed to help you to prepare for this exam.\n\n133\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.690\nNow remember that that's not\nwhat it's limited to, and\n\n134\n00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.260\nMicrosoft never says that, right?\n\n135\n00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.360\nThey say it's actually these\nthat we're gonna focus in on,\n\n136\n00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.290\nbut at the same time,\nthey rely on your previous skill and\n\n137\n00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.820\nknowledge with some of the tools that\nare also available for you out there.\n\n138\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.730\nSo if you're just trying to\nimplement Office 365, and\n\n139\n00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.300\ntrying to get started in that for\nyour network, or\n\n140\n00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.830\nif you're actually preparing for the exam,\nyou've come to the right place, and\n\n141\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.230\nthere's exciting shows for\nyou coming up in this series.\n\n142\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.360\nSo stay tuned for more.\n\n",
