          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.770\n[SOUND] In this video,\nwe're gonna take a minute to talk\n\n2\n00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.501\nabout the Microsoft Project certification.\n\n3\n00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.960\nIn particular,\nwe will get a little detail here.\n\n4\n00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.835\nThe 74-343 exam which, for those of\nyou that are wanting to learn how to\n\n5\n00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:24.490\nuse the Microsoft Project software,\nit really is a great place to start.\n\n6\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.590\nYou can jump right in, you can get\na great certification out of it.\n\n7\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.430\nOnce you've learned the material and\nyou've passed the exam,\n\n8\n00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.460\nyou get the Microsoft Certified\nProfessional, or MCP certification.\n\n9\n00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.030\nSo I mean, this is really a great thing.\n\n10\n00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.540\nNot just for project managers, but anybody\nwho works in a project environment.\n\n11\n00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.710\nTo be able to learn the software and\nget a certification at the same time.\n\n12\n00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.310\nI really enjoy this one.\n\n13\n00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.790\n>> Yeah, with Microsoft Project 2013,\nwe can actually go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.630\ntake a look at their exam objectives.\n\n15\n00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.750\nOn my screen I went ahead and\n\n16\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.130\npulled up the exam objectives\nfrom Microsoft's site itself.\n\n17\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.820\nAnd you can see that it gives you a lot\nof information right here at the top,\n\n18\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.652\nmost importantly for me normally\nis gonna be, of course, the cost.\n\n19\n00:01:01.652 --> 00:01:03.558\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The cost has gone up a little\n\n20\n00:01:03.558 --> 00:01:04.750\nbit over time.\n\n21\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.680\nAbout $150, US dollars of course,\nis what you can do.\n\n22\n00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.800\nAnd if you have Microsoft Project 2013,\nthey have the certification for that.\n\n23\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.270\nYou may still see that there's still\nMicrosoft Project 2010 as a possibility,\n\n24\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.570\nbut the older editions have\npretty much gone away,\n\n25\n00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.480\nthey've been deprecated at this point.\n\n26\n00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.910\nSo those exams will no longer count.\n\n27\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.152\nBut if you scroll down,\n\n28\n00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:28.709\nfrom this point here you can actually\nthen see the skills measured.\n\n29\n00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.860\nAnd this is what we\nreally wanna focus in on,\n\n30\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.177\nis to take a look at some of these\ndifferent exam objectives to help us\n\n31\n00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:37.540\nto be able to understand what\nthey're gonna ask us about.\n\n32\n00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.700\nAs well as to help us did it to\nfigure out how a project actually\n\n33\n00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.860\nworks in the betterment of\nactually doing project management.\n\n34\n00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.870\nSo, the first field that we're\nactually taking a look at in the exam\n\n35\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.980\nobjectives here is going to\nbe initializing a project.\n\n36\n00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.430\nNow a project really wants you to actually\nknow how to get a project that you've\n\n37\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.510\nalready got all the information for\nand get started as soon as you can.\n\n38\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.280\nSo in that project initialization,\n\n39\n00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.510\nwe're going to talk about things\nlike just how do we actually get\n\n40\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.980\nthe project started in order to show\nsome of the different ways to do so.\n\n41\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.920\nAnd the basic information that we\nneed just so that we can begin.\n\n42\n00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.560\n>> Yeah, and I\n\n43\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.860\nreally like the way Microsoft's\narranged the objectives on this one.\n\n44\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.730\nBecause you'll notice where it starts\nwith is just creating a blank project.\n\n45\n00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.170\nThey're not expecting you to have any\nprior knowledge of Microsoft Project,\n\n46\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.180\nyou don't have to have worked with it for\nyears to jump in and do this one.\n\n47\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.460\nSo if you've never used\nProject even a single time,\n\n48\n00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.550\nwell we're gonna start out\nright there at that beginning.\n\n49\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.070\nOpening the program, creating that first\nproject, and getting moving forward, so\n\n50\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.600\nreally, really useful stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.250\nAnd for the rest of the objectives,\n\n52\n00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.270\nMicrosoft really stayed true to the stuff\nyou're really gonna use type topics.\n\n53\n00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.890\nNot the esoteric, weird features that\nmost people don't work with, but\n\n54\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.192\nthe features that are really important to\neverybody who serves as a project manager\n\n55\n00:02:46.192 --> 00:02:48.930\nor just works within\na project environment.\n\n56\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.190\nSo, for example, the very second\nobjective is well, scheduling, right?\n\n57\n00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.780\nWhich is really important, it's a key\npiece of what a project manager does for\n\n58\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.310\na living, but it's also important for\nanybody who participates in that project.\n\n59\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.280\nA project is broken up\ninto multiple tasks.\n\n60\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.850\nAnd how do we make sure those tasks are\noccurring on time, you know at completion?\n\n61\n00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.860\nHow do we know if we're getting behind\nschedule or if we're ahead of schedule?\n\n62\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.380\nWe need to be able to understand that and\nMicrosoft Project can help us do that.\n\n63\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.170\n>> All right, it's a great place for us to\nat least get all of the tasks that we have\n\n64\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.190\nready to go and put it in one place.\n\n65\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.610\nThen that way we can see it.\n\n66\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.070\nAnd we'll end up seeing that once\nwe talk about creating a basic,\n\n67\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.570\na task based schedule.\n\n68\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.870\nWe'll then be able to\nstart manipulating it and\n\n69\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.020\nchanging it into the information\nthat we really need.\n\n70\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.490\nSo they go into simple things like setting\nup some basic information that we need for\n\n71\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.250\nthe overall project, and\n\n72\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.520\neven setting up what we'll call\nthe project task structure, and\n\n73\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.560\nthen logically structuring everything\nthe way that it needs to be done.\n\n74\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.080\nThe nice thing about Project is you\ncan just throw stuff in it, and\n\n75\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.460\nthen later on work with it and massage it\ninto what you actually would like to see.\n\n76\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.190\n>> Yeah, now, the third objective\nis our resource management.\n\n77\n00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.940\nOnce you've created all these tasks,\n\n78\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.100\nsomebody has to actually do the work,\nright?\n\n79\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.000\nSo we need to assign people to the tasks\nto do it, or maybe it's not people.\n\n80\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.770\nMaybe it's equipment,\nmachinery, other things,\n\n81\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.662\nother resources that we have to manage.\n\n82\n00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:12.970\nWe need to keep track of that to make\nsure that we don't do any kind of\n\n83\n00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.210\nover allocation.\n\n84\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.870\nI don't want to book Ronnie to\ndo two things at the same time.\n\n85\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.790\nSo we gotta make sure that we can have\nthat in an easy to see environment,\n\n86\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.530\nthat helps us to locate area's\nwhere we've got problems.\n\n87\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.620\nWhere we don't have enough resources, or\n\n88\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.440\nwe've over allocated somebody and\ncreated an issue.\n\n89\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.630\nSo, that's what the third\nobjective is all about.\n\n90\n00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.960\nAs we scroll down I can see that\nthe fourth objective takes a look at\n\n91\n00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.880\ntracking and analyzing a project itself.\n\n92\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.480\nOnce we get everything in place inside\nthe project, we know actually start seeing\n\n93\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.920\nthe power of Microsoft project\nto display what we need to.\n\n94\n00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.190\nSo that what we can do is we can\ntake the information out of Project,\n\n95\n00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.590\nbe able to create the reports that we\nneed, be able to analyze the information,\n\n96\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.540\nand that way keep our project on\nschedule in the way that it needs to go.\n\n97\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.130\n>> Now the fifth objective, and the final\nobjective, is probably my favorite because\n\n98\n00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.960\nall this good information inside of\nMicrosoft Project is all designed for\n\n99\n00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.050\nproject managers.\n\n100\n00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.690\nMicrosoft knows that it's project\nmanagers that are gonna be using this\n\n101\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.780\nsoftware the most.\n\n102\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.540\nAnd so the terminology that's used,\nthe tools,\n\n103\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.880\nit's all built around what\nwe do as a project manager.\n\n104\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.700\nBut the rest of your company needs to be\nable to benefit from this information, and\n\n105\n00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.870\nthey don't know what a BCWP is.\n\n106\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.290\nThey don't understand planned value or\nan SPI.\n\n107\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.240\nThat stuff doesn't mean anything to them.\n\n108\n00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.880\nSo we've gotta have some way to\ntake the information in project and\n\n109\n00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.410\nget that out in a way that's meaningful to\nthe other people in our company, right?\n\n110\n00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.950\nIf I give somebody a calendar,\nthey know what a calendar is.\n\n111\n00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.570\nThey can read that.\n\n112\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.300\nThey go, this is Tuesday,\nI'm supposed to be here at this time.\n\n113\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.770\nThey understand that, right?\n\n114\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.290\nOr here's a pie chart that shows tasks\nthat are completed, and tasks that aren't.\n\n115\n00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.360\nThat's the kind of information\npeople understand.\n\n116\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.260\nAnd Project has a ton of\nways to output data and\n\n117\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.860\ntranslate it from our project management\nlanguage into regular English,\n\n118\n00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.620\nor well whatever language\nyou speak in your country.\n\n119\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.250\nInto regular easily understandable charts,\n\n120\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.040\ndiagrams, lists,\njust all sorts of different formats.\n\n121\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.410\nIt's really powerful.\n\n122\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.910\n>> It really is.\n\n123\n00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.650\nSo, those are the five objectives that\nwe're taking a look at when we go through\n\n124\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.600\nour show here, for the 74-343 show, and\nthere's a lot for us to cover, Don.\n\n125\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.240\n>> Yeah, so if that sounds exciting and\nfun to you you're in the right place.\n\n126\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.590\nStay tuned for it.\n\n127\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.240\nAlso keep in mind that this is\nusing a tool to manage projects.\n\n128\n00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.830\nIf you want to learn more about\nactually doing project management,\n\n129\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.470\njust the concepts and theory behind it,\nwe do have other training here on ITProTV\n\n130\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.310\nlike the project management\nprofessional training that we did.\n\n131\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.500\nSo check that out, too.\n\n132\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.650\nNow, the order doesn't really matter.\n\n133\n00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.470\nYou can learn the tool first and\nthen learn the fundamentals later, or\n\n134\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.210\nthe other way around.\n\n135\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.970\nBut I find it is pretty beneficial to\nalready understand the fundamentals,\n\n136\n00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.270\nif we're doing task scheduling, you should\nprobably understand the concepts behind\n\n137\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.620\nduration, resource allocation, and so on.\n\n138\n00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.940\nSo if you haven't already,\n\n139\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.530\nbe sure to check out the project\nmanagement professionals series.\n\n140\n00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.880\nIt's a great one.\n\n141\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.060\nIt was you and I Ronnie, right?\n\n142\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.959\nWe did that one.\nSo, [LAUGH] filmed it a few months ago.\n\n143\n00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.918\nSo definitely it's something\nworth checking out.\n\n144\n00:07:08.918 --> 00:07:11.583\nBut as far as Microsoft Project,\nthis is the place to be.\n\n145\n00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:14.876\nSo stay tuned,\nwe got Microsoft Project coming up next.\n\n146\n00:07:14.876 --> 00:07:20.125\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.580\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.790\nI'm your host Don Pezet back with Mr.\nRonnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.870\n>> It is going well today,\n\n6\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.430\nanother beautiful day, ready to get\nstarted on some exciting technology.\n\n7\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.420\n>> Yeah, the technology for\n\n8\n00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.720\ntoday is Microsoft Project and this is\nour very first episode so we're gonna\n\n9\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.070\nget a chance to see what Microsoft Project\nis and how to get started with it, right?\n\n10\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.290\nNow, if you're here and you're watching\nthis, you could just be randomly watching\n\n11\n00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.866\nepisodes, I suppose that's possible,\nbut more than likely you're in\n\n12\n00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.877\na situation where You have\na project that you need to manage.\n\n13\n00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:47.840\nAnd I guess that's where the whole\nproject management thing comes in.\n\n14\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.140\nAnd you've recognized that I\ncould use Notepad or Excel.\n\n15\n00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.420\nI could write things down on Post it\nnotes and stick them on the wall.\n\n16\n00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.280\nI could take, what are they called?\n\n17\n00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.090\nInk blotters, right, those big desk\ncalendars, and just write things on there.\n\n18\n00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.870\nBut in a big project,\nthings get out of hand pretty fast.\n\n19\n00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410\nAnd so it sure would be nice\nif there was some program,\n\n20\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.640\nsome kind of software I could run, that\nhelped me to make sense of all the data,\n\n21\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.380\nto keep track of all\nthe interconnected tasks and\n\n22\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.550\nactivities, to ensure that our\nproject finishes on time, right.\n\n23\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.070\nOn budget, and meets requirements, right.\n\n24\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.870\nIn the project management world, we have\nthe triangle, the triple constraints,\n\n25\n00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.610\nright, is the official term.\n\n26\n00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.310\nWhere every schedule has, or\nevery project has a schedule, right.\n\n27\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.750\nWhich is your calendar.\n\n28\n00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.620\nYou've got your budget, or your cost.\n\n29\n00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.470\nAnd then you've got your requirements,\nor your quality, right.\n\n30\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.606\nSo those three things that we work to\nour project, we need to guarantee those.\n\n31\n00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:46.986\nAnd Microsoft Project is\npacked full of tools and\n\n32\n00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:51.610\nutilities that help to track and\ninsure all three of those things.\n\n33\n00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.640\nSo it's really valuable.\n\n34\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.930\nBut in this episode,\nwe're gonna get started with it.\n\n35\n00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.400\nAnd we'll get chance to unlock\nall that functionality throughout\n\n36\n00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.570\nthis whole series.\n\n37\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.310\n>> When you start taking\na look at Microsoft Project,\n\n38\n00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.060\nwhat Don told us is right.\n\n39\n00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.340\nWe can take so many different applications\nand do everything that Project\n\n40\n00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.300\nsays that we can do, but the nice thing is\nin Project we can do it all in one place.\n\n41\n00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.350\nSo, if I wanted to make a task list,\nI could simply do the very same thing.\n\n42\n00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.320\nJust go, okay, we'll open up Notepad,\nwe'll make a list of different things, or\n\n43\n00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.860\nopen up Excel or do that.\n\n44\n00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.740\nAnd then I want to keep track and schedule\nof different things that are going on\n\n45\n00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.750\nI can bring up a calendar program\nof some kind, and do that as well.\n\n46\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.070\nAnd then when I start\nassigning resources and\n\n47\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.200\nfiguring out what I need to do,\nI might just use my email system, or\n\n48\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.440\nsome type of system that helps me to\nactually know who can be on my project.\n\n49\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.950\nBut Project in itself\nis a single application\n\n50\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.030\nthat really does help us to be able to\ntrack all those different things, right.\n\n51\n00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.220\nIt allows us to be able to take the idea\nof the time and the actual requirements\n\n52\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.090\nthemselves, or the scope a lot of\nthe time when we start seeing it.\n\n53\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.850\nAnd, the third constraint,\nwhich for some reason or\n\n54\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.460\nanother is slipping my mind right now,\nit's.\n\n55\n00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.640\n>> It's schedule\n>> Schedule\n\n56\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.850\n>> You've got budget, and\n\n57\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.110\nyou've got your requirements, or\n\n58\n00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.970\nyour quality\n>> And\n\n59\n00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.742\nof all the things that i\nmessed up on it's the money.\n\n60\n00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:09.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Out of all the things that.\n\n61\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.640\nAnd I'm usually a tightwad, so that's the\none thing that I should have remembered.\n\n62\n00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.980\nBut it actually helps you to\nkeep track of it in one place.\n\n63\n00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.520\nSo, it is an incredibly nice\napplication that we can have\n\n64\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.010\non our computers to really help us\nto be able to manage everything.\n\n65\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.530\nNow, when we start taking a look at it,\nwe want to\n\n66\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.320\nat least show you how you can get\nstarted just about immediately with it.\n\n67\n00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.520\nSo on my computer, we're going to go ahead\nand take a look at some of the different\n\n68\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.210\nways that we can get started in\njust creating a project right now.\n\n69\n00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.225\nSo, on my Windows 8.1 machine,\nI'm going to launch Project.\n\n70\n00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:46.115\nAnd so I'm simply gonna type in project\nin my search and go ahead and launch it.\n\n71\n00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:49.685\nAnd I want you to see right away what\nends up normally happening, right?\n\n72\n00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:52.834\nProject doesn't just want to open up and\nintimidate you.\n\n73\n00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:55.291\nAnd the reason why I say\nthat is I remember Don,\n\n74\n00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:57.182\nfrom working in Project 2003.\n\n75\n00:03:57.182 --> 00:04:00.203\nYou opened it up and\nyou looked at it and there were so\n\n76\n00:04:00.203 --> 00:04:03.506\nmany different links up there\nat the top on the menu bar,\n\n77\n00:04:03.506 --> 00:04:07.815\nyou just kinda looked at it and go okay,\nI'm not sure exactly what to do.\n\n78\n00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:11.160\nWell with project 2013 they're saying,\nlook, let's make this easier.\n\n79\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.250\nOkay, at the very beginning if you don't\nknow what you're doing at all, we're going\n\n80\n00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.880\nto lead you in the path that we believe\n[LAUGH] you should at least try and take.\n\n81\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.310\nAnd so right away they make a nice\nlittle graphical interface here.\n\n82\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.850\nTo actually show you at\nleast these top three or\n\n83\n00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.150\nfour options right here that they're\nactually saying that you can try and do.\n\n84\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.220\nNow we're going to ask you to take it from\neasiest, of course, to the hardest way to\n\n85\n00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.540\ndo this so that you can see right\naway what ends up happening, right?\n\n86\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.670\nSo one of the easiest things to\nactually do then is to sit there and\n\n87\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.290\ngo all right, I don't know\nexactly what needs to happen but\n\n88\n00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.200\nI do know that Don just\nfinished a project.\n\n89\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.030\nOkay, you just finished one and what I\ncan do is I can take that project and\n\n90\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.550\njust import it in and open it up and then\nlater on save it as it my own template.\n\n91\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.740\nAnd that way I can get\nrid of all the stuff.\n\n92\n00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.490\nAnd I should be able to open it up and\nnow I have all of my stuff.\n\n93\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.120\n>> Now think if you're working in\nthe construction industry right?\n\n94\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.830\nMaybe your company builds houses,\n\n95\n00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.850\nwell every time you build a new\nhouse that's a project, right?\n\n96\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.560\nAnd you wanna take that from\nstart to completion and\n\n97\n00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.820\nproduce this house on schedule,\non budget and all that.\n\n98\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.510\nWell, every house you build\nmight be a little bit different.\n\n99\n00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.020\nThey're their own project.\n\n100\n00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.050\nBut there's a lot of stuff\nthat's going to be the same.\n\n101\n00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.010\nPulling permits, laying the foundation,\nputting up the drywall,\n\n102\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.650\nputting on the roof.\n\n103\n00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.930\nSure, the roof might be a different size\nbut you're still gonna have that happen.\n\n104\n00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.800\nSo instead of reinventing the wheel\nevery time you create a new project,\n\n105\n00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.400\nyou can just take an existing project and\nclone it.\n\n106\n00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.260\nIt saves a lot of time.\n\n107\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.680\nNot everybody can do that, right?\n\n108\n00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.120\nSometimes each of your\nprojects are just so\n\n109\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.590\nunique that you're better off starting\nfrom scratch, and that happens.\n\n110\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.840\nBut if you can rely on the artifacts\nfrom a previous project,\n\n111\n00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.660\nthat's gonna save you a lot of time.\n\n112\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.280\n>> It really is.\n\n113\n00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.680\nIt's gonna save you so much time that\nyou're not gonna actually believe it.\n\n114\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.740\nEspecially when you know\nthat I really mean it.\n\n115\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.170\nIf you don't know exactly\nwhat's happening, but\n\n116\n00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.060\nyou know that you're working\non a similar project.\n\n117\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.900\nImagine if all of the basic\nwork is already done for\n\n118\n00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.630\nyou and hardest part about doing what I'm\ntalking about Is actually getting rid of\n\n119\n00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.190\nexisting information that I\ndon't want to appear in it.\n\n120\n00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.910\nLet's show you what I'm\ntalking about here.\n\n121\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.470\nSo here inside a project,\n\n122\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.990\nright away they open us up to this\nnice little graphical interface.\n\n123\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.475\nNotice they have new\nfrom an existing project.\n\n124\n00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:25.020\nSo I can go right ahead and select that\noption and of course that brings me then\n\n125\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.130\ninto some of the different projects that\nwe might already have examples of, and\n\n126\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.470\nthe one that I want is actually\nthe original terminal server switchover\n\n127\n00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.840\nproject here.\n\n128\n00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.790\nAnd I'm going to click Open.\n\n129\n00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.850\nNow, when I do this, this is a project\nthat we actually did work on not too long,\n\n130\n00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.650\nI say not too long, a couple of years ago.\n\n131\n00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.050\nIt is one that we did work on, and\nit was finished, and figured out, and\n\n132\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.660\neverything is actually done.\n\n133\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.370\nWell if I know that I'm doing something\nvery similar to this I can start.\n\n134\n00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.660\nNow Don I could simply just start\nfrom here and start doing it over.\n\n135\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.280\nBut the problem is all this other\nstuff that's actually in here.\n\n136\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.480\nIt might throw me off because it's\nalready got everything figured out.\n\n137\n00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.750\n>> Yeah, you might have like, for\nexample, every single one of those tasks,\n\n138\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.130\nthis project is done so every one of those\ntasks should have a completion of 100%.\n\n139\n00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.920\nRight?\n\n140\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.680\nWell, if I'm starting a brand new project\nI need to go and change all of those back\n\n141\n00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.390\nto 0% and there are resources assigned,\nmaybe I was working on that project and\n\n142\n00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.964\non the new project there's\ngoing to be another resource.\n\n143\n00:07:18.964 --> 00:07:22.160\nSo there's a lot of stuff we have to\nchange so when you create a new project we\n\n144\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.940\nprobably want to exclude some\nof that data, right Ronny?\n\n145\n00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.550\n>> Yep.\n\n146\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.550\nYou wanna exclude, and the easiest way to\ndo so is simply by taking this project and\n\n147\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.190\nturning it into a template.\n\n148\n00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.640\nTurning into a template is fairly easy.\n\n149\n00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.940\nAll I have to do is go up to File, and\n\n150\n00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.080\nfrom that point I can use this,\nwhat they call a backstage.\n\n151\n00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.358\nAnd select Save As And\n\n152\n00:07:40.358 --> 00:07:43.918\nwhen I do that I can tell it what\nlocation I want to save it in.\n\n153\n00:07:43.918 --> 00:07:47.174\nSo I'm gonna save project,\nmy documents folder and\n\n154\n00:07:47.174 --> 00:07:49.400\nthen I can click on the Save As type.\n\n155\n00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.459\nFrom there,\nnotice I have these two options.\n\n156\n00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:55.356\nIf I was working with an earlier addition\nof project I may choose that one option,\n\n157\n00:07:55.356 --> 00:07:59.790\nbut I'm just gonna select the current\nedition, which is project template.\n\n158\n00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.590\nWhen I select that, and I'm just\ngoing to now say that this is my new\n\n159\n00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:09.770\nproject switchover, I'm gonna call\nit a template, and then click Save.\n\n160\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.450\nThis is where we have that\nability to go in, and\n\n161\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.052\ninstead of saving all of the previous\nexisting work that's actually been done,\n\n162\n00:08:17.052 --> 00:08:20.550\nit says, you're now about to save this\nas a template, look what you can do,\n\n163\n00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.120\nyou can choose to remove the following\ndata items from this template.\n\n164\n00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.580\nSo I can remove all of the actual\nbaseline values that we set,\n\n165\n00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.920\nany of the resources, and resource\nrates if I know I'm not working for\n\n166\n00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:38.630\nthe same people or the rates have actually\nchanged now, fix cost and on this one I'm\n\n167\n00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.390\nnot going to worry about it, cuz I'm not\nactually connected to the project web app.\n\n168\n00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:46.040\nBut notice,\nI can take all of that information now and\n\n169\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.580\nessentially remove it from\nthe existing project plan.\n\n170\n00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.080\nAnd now when I go ahead and click Save,\nnow I have a project template.\n\n171\n00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.100\nNow all the other stuff is still there,\nresource names, in other words,\n\n172\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.580\njust leaving all that other stuff,\n\n173\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.560\nbut then if I go into Project,\nand Project Information,\n\n174\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.340\nit's right here under Statistics\nthat now everything's zeroed out.\n\n175\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.360\nNow before I actually did have data in\nthere because it was an existing, or\n\n176\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.470\na finished project plan, but\nit just leaves some of the stuff that it\n\n177\n00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.210\ncan really help me out with,\nas far as the duration,\n\n178\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.310\nhow long I believe this project's gonna\nlast, some of the work information.\n\n179\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.650\nBut from this point on,\nI now can use it as a template.\n\n180\n00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.135\nWhat I would simply do is now save it\nas the name of my current project, and\n\n181\n00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:32.935\nI'm ready to actually roll from there\nbecause now everything is kinda set up,\n\n182\n00:09:32.935 --> 00:09:34.985\nI just changed from the resource names.\n\n183\n00:09:34.985 --> 00:09:38.495\nI can go ahead and tweak whatever I need\nto, add in some different tasks, and\n\n184\n00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:39.035\nwe're ready to go.\n\n185\n00:09:39.035 --> 00:09:41.105\n>> Yeah that definitely saves some time.\n\n186\n00:09:41.105 --> 00:09:43.946\nNow you could have also, when you\nopened up Project and you got that\n\n187\n00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:47.347\nfirst screen you could have just hit the\nblank project button and then gone in and\n\n188\n00:09:47.347 --> 00:09:51.177\nre-did everything from scratch, but\nthis certainly does save a lot of time.\n\n189\n00:09:51.177 --> 00:09:53.769\nNow Ronnie, there's other ways that\nwe can create a project too and\n\n190\n00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:55.099\nI'll give you an example from me.\n\n191\n00:09:55.099 --> 00:09:55.607\n>> Sure.\n>> So,\n\n192\n00:09:55.607 --> 00:09:59.522\nusually a project kicks off in\na very impromptu kind of meeting.\n\n193\n00:09:59.522 --> 00:10:01.472\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So maybe you're on a conference room,\n\n194\n00:10:01.472 --> 00:10:04.397\nyou're sitting somewhere, and\nyou're talking to somebody, and you say,\n\n195\n00:10:04.397 --> 00:10:06.650\nall right, you know what,\nwe need to create this project.\n\n196\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.710\nThis is something that's gonna happen,\n\n197\n00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.590\nso let's just real high-level,\ncome up with a list of tasks.\n\n198\n00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.460\nAnd you start just jotting\ndown that list of tasks,\n\n199\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.899\nand maybe you don't have\nMicrosoft Project handy, right.\n\n200\n00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:19.480\nA project manager is gonna have\nMicrosoft Project on their machine, but\n\n201\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.730\nsomebody who's sponsoring a project,\nthey're not a project manager,\n\n202\n00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.379\nnot normally, and so\nthey might have something else.\n\n203\n00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:26.950\nThey might have Microsoft Excel, or\n\n204\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.410\nSharePoint, so they go in SharePoint and\nthey just start creating a bunch of tasks.\n\n205\n00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.083\nOr they fire up Microsoft Outlook,\nthis is the worst way, but you can do it.\n\n206\n00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:35.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They fire up Microsoft Outlook and\n\n207\n00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.191\nthey start creating tasks in Outlook,\nor they just fire up Excel, and\n\n208\n00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:39.680\nthis is what I normally do.\n\n209\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.790\nIf it's the very early\nstages of the project,\n\n210\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.010\nif we're just trying to figure out tasks,\nI won't even mess with Microsoft Project,\n\n211\n00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.175\nI'll fire up Excel, and just right there\nin a spreadsheet start listing out tasks\n\n212\n00:10:49.175 --> 00:10:51.275\nand punching in whatever\ndata I've got at that time.\n\n213\n00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:54.087\nAnd in the planning stages,\nyou don't normally have a lot of data.\n\n214\n00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:58.135\nWe don't normally have cost and things, so\nit just might be task names and that's it.\n\n215\n00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:02.265\nAnd so I'm just coming up with a list of\ntask names and maybe an estimated duration\n\n216\n00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:06.590\nand that might even come later,\nright, so we jot it down in Excel.\n\n217\n00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.000\nWell now I need to get that data\nfrom Excel into Microsoft Project.\n\n218\n00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.320\nI need to get that data out of SharePoint\nand into Microsoft Project or I need to\n\n219\n00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.300\nget that data out of Outlook and throw it\nin there, right, so Ronnie we can do that.\n\n220\n00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.780\n>> We absolutely can do that, let me show\nyou an example of what I'm talking about.\n\n221\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.994\nJust like what Don was talking about, a\nlot of times the person that's helping you\n\n222\n00:11:24.994 --> 00:11:26.997\nout with the project and\ncoming up with task lists,\n\n223\n00:11:26.997 --> 00:11:29.792\nmay not actually have Project on\ntheir machine, which means that hey,\n\n224\n00:11:29.792 --> 00:11:32.355\nthey're not going to have access\nto all the other neat tools, but\n\n225\n00:11:32.355 --> 00:11:35.835\nthey might have something like Excel, and\nthat's what they're used to working with.\n\n226\n00:11:35.835 --> 00:11:38.915\nSo you can see here I've pulled\nup on the Microsoft Excel Viewer,\n\n227\n00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:42.107\nan Excel spreadsheet that has some\nof these different things that we\n\n228\n00:11:42.107 --> 00:11:43.567\nwere working with at the time.\n\n229\n00:11:43.567 --> 00:11:46.812\nWhen we were setting up and\nswitching over to using terminal servers,\n\n230\n00:11:46.812 --> 00:11:49.727\nwe had to come up with a list of\nwhat we thought needed to happen,\n\n231\n00:11:49.727 --> 00:11:51.600\nwhat we thought needed to occur.\n\n232\n00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.025\nAnd doesn't mean this complete list,\n\n233\n00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:55.480\nit's what we started off\nwith as the initiation.\n\n234\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.600\nWe may add a few more things in there, but\n\n235\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.000\nthis is a great place to start\ninstead of having to start all over.\n\n236\n00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.255\nSo if I have that list already,\n\n237\n00:12:04.255 --> 00:12:09.305\nthen if I launch Project and I'm back\nhere on the new screen, once again,\n\n238\n00:12:09.305 --> 00:12:14.755\nif I select that, notice that I have this\noption that says, New From Excel workbook.\n\n239\n00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:18.493\nIf I go ahead and select that option,\nthen I can go to,\n\n240\n00:12:18.493 --> 00:12:23.160\nlet me see where I actually put it,\nthat would actually help here.\n\n241\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.264\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go,\n\n242\n00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:27.455\nI think it's under my shared folders,\nthat's where it is.\n\n243\n00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:32.107\nWell I'm lying to you, oh it's under-\n>> Why'd it default to XML,\n\n244\n00:12:32.107 --> 00:12:33.515\nit's the same XML today.\n\n245\n00:12:33.515 --> 00:12:34.710\n>> Yeah, I don't know.\n\n246\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.930\nSo I'll select my TS_Project Tasks, and\n\n247\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.190\nselect Open, and\nthen we run through this import wizard.\n\n248\n00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.650\nNow you do wanna slow down here,\nI know with me,\n\n249\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.910\nI get click happy when I start seeing\none of these wizards like, oh,\n\n250\n00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.520\nthat's gotta be the easiest thing ever,\nand then just start importing in.\n\n251\n00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.280\nBut notice here on the import wizard it\ngives me that ability to walk through.\n\n252\n00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.130\nSo I'm simply gonna select Next and\nit's gonna say, hey look, there's already\n\n253\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:02.510\na structure in place, do you want to try\nand link this to an existing structure, or\n\n254\n00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.840\ndo you want to actually go ahead and\ncreate a new mapping?\n\n255\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.020\nSo in the beginning, I might have\nactually selected in Excel and\n\n256\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.260\nhad a name that's not gonna exist\nin Project, and it's saying,\n\n257\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.238\nhey, do you wanna try and\nlink those or not?\n\n258\n00:13:14.238 --> 00:13:18.030\n>> Yeah, remember what I was saying, how\nwhen you're at this stage in the project,\n\n259\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.050\nhow much information do you really have?\n\n260\n00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.395\nYou might not have much information,\nyou might only have task names.\n\n261\n00:13:23.395 --> 00:13:26.370\nAnd Ronnie bring your Excel\nspreadsheet back up again,\n\n262\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.580\nyou just had task name, right?\n\n263\n00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.461\n>> That's it.\n>> All right,\n\n264\n00:13:28.461 --> 00:13:31.088\nbut if you're sitting there and\nyou're talking to people, they might\n\n265\n00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:33.979\nhave other information too, they might\neven have some estimated durations,\n\n266\n00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:36.170\nmaybe not for every task,\nbut for some of them.\n\n267\n00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.734\nOr there might be particular resources in\nmind, maybe there's this one web developer\n\n268\n00:13:41.745 --> 00:13:44.595\nBrian, and you know you're gonna\nuse Brian on some of these things.\n\n269\n00:13:44.595 --> 00:13:47.339\nSo you might create a second column\nwhere you put your resources in,\n\n270\n00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:48.805\nyour resource assignments.\n\n271\n00:13:48.805 --> 00:13:52.135\nYou might create a third column\nthat's listing predecessors,\n\n272\n00:13:52.135 --> 00:13:54.065\nwhat tasks are linked to other tasks.\n\n273\n00:13:54.065 --> 00:13:57.800\nSo the more information you have, the more\nyou might be putting here in Excel.\n\n274\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.810\nSo when we do this import,\nProject is asking us to create a map.\n\n275\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:08.280\nMapping each of those columns on the\nscreen there to a value inside of Project.\n\n276\n00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.970\nSo that column that Ronnie has with the\ntask names, he put at the top right there,\n\n277\n00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.300\nTaskName, right?\n\n278\n00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.910\nBut maybe you called it Description.\n\n279\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.660\nWell Project doesn't know\nwhat Description is, so\n\n280\n00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.340\nyou need to map that\nto the TaskName field.\n\n281\n00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.140\nAnd you might have a resource column or\npredecessor column and\n\n282\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.700\nthat may not be the same name, and\nso the map is just telling Project,\n\n283\n00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.560\nhey, here's what I put in column two,\nhere's what I put in column three.\n\n284\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.280\nWhen you read column number four,\nthis what value I'm talking about, right.\n\n285\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.650\nNow, if you're constantly importing\ndata like this over and over and\n\n286\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.600\nover again, you can save the map,\nand have it available for reuse.\n\n287\n00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.710\nBut I'll tell you, I do this a lot.\n\n288\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.370\nI don't think I've ever used a map,\nbecause it seems like every time I fire\n\n289\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.623\nup Excel I use some kind of crazy\ndifferent naming convention.\n\n290\n00:14:48.623 --> 00:14:49.498\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n291\n00:14:49.498 --> 00:14:51.579\ncreating a new map, this is pretty common,\n\n292\n00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:56.080\nand then we're just tying those columns to\nwhat their associated value in Project is.\n\n293\n00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.760\n>> And I do the same thing, just like Don\nsaid, I never know, even though I think\n\n294\n00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.080\nI'm consistent, I'll look back and\nI'm like, oh, I didn't use name,\n\n295\n00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.210\nI used something else, and so a new map\nis pretty much what you'll end up seeing.\n\n296\n00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.500\nSo I'm gonna click Next here, and\nthen it's gonna ask me what I want to do.\n\n297\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.886\nNow here's actually\nsomething that's very neat,\n\n298\n00:15:12.886 --> 00:15:16.095\nwhen we actually are using\nthe information that we're importing in.\n\n299\n00:15:16.095 --> 00:15:20.208\nNotice I can just bring this into a brand\nnew project or I can append it or\n\n300\n00:15:20.208 --> 00:15:23.120\nmerge it together into an active project.\n\n301\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.945\nAppend means exactly what it says here,\nit's to add in addition to an existing\n\n302\n00:15:26.945 --> 00:15:30.425\nproject and then to merge it in means hey,\ntake a look and see if\n\n303\n00:15:30.425 --> 00:15:34.625\nanything's changed here and merge those\nvalues in place where they need to be.\n\n304\n00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:37.595\nWe're just gonna do a new project at this\npoint cuz I don't have an existing one\n\n305\n00:15:37.595 --> 00:15:38.795\nthat I'm merging into.\n\n306\n00:15:38.795 --> 00:15:40.263\nBut you do have that ability,\n\n307\n00:15:40.263 --> 00:15:44.334\nlet's say later on that you choose to\nactually add in that resource name, right.\n\n308\n00:15:44.334 --> 00:15:48.826\nSo on my Excel spreadsheet, I actually\ndid select a different sheet as well, and\n\n309\n00:15:48.826 --> 00:15:52.324\nI just added in some of the names\nthat we were gonna end up using,\n\n310\n00:15:52.324 --> 00:15:54.459\nsome of the resources that we needed.\n\n311\n00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:57.289\nJust as I was thinking about this\nproject as we were going through So\n\n312\n00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:59.220\nI may actually use that\na little bit later on.\n\n313\n00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.585\nI may not want to do it right away.\n\n314\n00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.820\nI may just want to see what happens here.\n\n315\n00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.790\nSo at this point I'm gonna\nselect a new project, and\n\n316\n00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.430\nthen later I might add on that second one,\n\n317\n00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:11.150\nto tell it to append to the existing\nproject to add in the other information.\n\n318\n00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.780\nSo New project, and then it's gonna say\nwhat type of data do I want to import?\n\n319\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.490\nI can choose both of them right now,\n\n320\n00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.440\nI'm just gonna choose the tasks\nto make it easy on us.\n\n321\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.770\nAnd then do I want to import the,\nthe import includes headers,\n\n322\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.530\nI do have one header field so\nI need to make sure I mark that.\n\n323\n00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.045\n>> And at the header\n>> If you're not familiar with it that's\n\n324\n00:16:29.045 --> 00:16:30.285\njust the column title.\n\n325\n00:16:30.285 --> 00:16:33.785\nSo in that very first row in Excel,\nRonnie had put task man.\n\n326\n00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.665\nRight.\nWhat he might have just left.\n\n327\n00:16:35.665 --> 00:16:38.055\nAnd then that first row is an actual task.\n\n328\n00:16:38.055 --> 00:16:39.495\nAnd so that's what you're saying here.\n\n329\n00:16:39.495 --> 00:16:40.890\nWhether or\nnot you put those names on there.\n\n330\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:41.390\n>> Right?\n\n331\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.120\n>> And then, in a moment,\n\n332\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.740\nyou're going to see where it gives\nyou a nice little window about\n\n333\n00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.860\nwhat is actually going to match up.\n\n334\n00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.620\nSo, I need to of course select\nthe tasks of the worksheet aim,\n\n335\n00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.660\nI believe that's the one\nI actually select.\n\n336\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.920\nYep.\nThat's task, so\n\n337\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.370\nsometimes I have to verify, and\n\n338\n00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.770\nnotice that it's not mapped to any\nparticular project field at all.\n\n339\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.460\nSo, it doesn't find an automatic matching,\nit's saying,\n\n340\n00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.510\nhey I don't see this exact name\ninside of Microsoft Project.\n\n341\n00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.770\nSo then it gives me that ability\nto select that drop-down.\n\n342\n00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:16.090\nAnd now I scroll down, and because I think\nthat I've worked with Project before,\n\n343\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:21.095\nDon, I always believe that task name\nis actually the name that is in here.\n\n344\n00:17:21.095 --> 00:17:22.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I scroll down to Task and\n\n345\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.950\nI'm like, oh, it's not in there.\n\n346\n00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.600\nAnd that is because inside of Project,\nthey actually don't call it task name.\n\n347\n00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.625\nThey call it Name.\n\n348\n00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:32.065\n[LAUGH] That is the name.\n\n349\n00:17:32.065 --> 00:17:33.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Because a task is\n\n350\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.460\nthe primary thing that you work with,\nso they just leave that part off.\n\n351\n00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.760\nRemember that at the end of the day,\n\n352\n00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.875\nMicrosoft Project is really\ncreating a database for you.\n\n353\n00:17:40.875 --> 00:17:44.665\nIt's creating a fairly complex Microsoft\nAccess database on the back-end, and\n\n354\n00:17:44.665 --> 00:17:46.995\nso everything has a field\nthat it gets stored in.\n\n355\n00:17:46.995 --> 00:17:50.845\nEverything is a column in a table\nsomewhere that's been defined, so\n\n356\n00:17:50.845 --> 00:17:52.445\nwe're just trying to match that up.\n\n357\n00:17:52.445 --> 00:17:54.580\nMatching up Ronnie's column name or\n\n358\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.910\ntask name with the column\nname inside a project.\n\n359\n00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.530\nAnd you guys saw there's a lot in there.\n\n360\n00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.210\nThere's well over 100\ndifferent column names, and\n\n361\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.030\nyou gotta make sure you choose\nthe right one to do this import.\n\n362\n00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.650\n>> Yeah.\nOnce we choose that right one,\n\n363\n00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.680\nit gives you a nice little preview.\n\n364\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.630\nAnd even though it doesn't give you a lot\nof the preview, it should be enough to\n\n365\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.040\nsay, yeah, that's exactly what I\nthought should go into that name there.\n\n366\n00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.100\nAnd so you see where the first\none actually tells you Excel, and\n\n367\n00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.200\nthen Project, and what, normally,\nthe data's gonna be listed under there.\n\n368\n00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.400\nClick Next and now it's gonna say hey,\nare you sure that everything is done?\n\n369\n00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.660\nIf you know you're gonna be doing\nthis again, you can save that map.\n\n370\n00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.140\nI'm probably not going to,\nso I'm gonna click Finish.\n\n371\n00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.610\nAnd in a moment, you'll actually end up\nseeing, without me, Don, having to type.\n\n372\n00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.240\nWhich you know that typing\nis not my best ability here.\n\n373\n00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.140\nWithout me having to type\nin all this information,\n\n374\n00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.770\nI was actually able then to\njust import it directly in.\n\n375\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.340\nAnd now I have the basis for\nmy new project.\n\n376\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:56.040\nAnd so I go with a file save, and from\nthis point I save it in my documents here,\n\n377\n00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.960\nand well call this\nProject Tasks 2015 here.\n\n378\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:03.330\nAnd Click save.\n\n379\n00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.480\nAnd once I do that, now we have a basis\nfor starting to work with project.\n\n380\n00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.830\nSo, we can use something like Excel,\nwe can of course use\n\n381\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.980\nan existing project that we're talking\nabout, one that was already filled out.\n\n382\n00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.990\nBut, what if we're kind of starting off,\nand\n\n383\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.830\nwe really just don't know what\nit is we needed to be doing.\n\n384\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.910\n>> Well the good thing is,\nProject actually helps us even there.\n\n385\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.960\nIf I go back to File and I click on New,\n\n386\n00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.700\nnotice that there's actually a lot\nof other information here Don.\n\n387\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.850\nUnderneath some of the different templates\nthat they have so that we can get started.\n\n388\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.550\n>> So with Project, there's actually\nover 20 different Project templates.\n\n389\n00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.560\nSome that relate directly\nto Project management.\n\n390\n00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.100\nBut the nice thing is some of them\nactually relate to things that we might be\n\n391\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.310\ndoing, such as software development plan.\n\n392\n00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.580\nSomebody's already done that.\n\n393\n00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.330\nResidential construction,\nearned value Commercial,\n\n394\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:56.600\nand they've even tried to tie it in even,\nmore closely towards the PnP\n\n395\n00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.940\nusing the PMBOK and\nyou'll see a few of them down here.\n\n396\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.690\nEven talk about,\nlet me see if I can find it down here.\n\n397\n00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.850\nThere's PMBOK Compliance Project,\nProject Management Institute, You name it.\n\n398\n00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.560\nThey went ahead and actually added in\njust a few generic templates for us, too.\n\n399\n00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.080\n>> And the ones you're seeing there\nare ones that have been tested and\n\n400\n00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.960\napproved by Microsoft.\n\n401\n00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.670\nThere's a little search box at the top\nthat says search for online templates.\n\n402\n00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.860\nYou can search the entire Microsoft Office\nOnline library, which includes hundreds,\n\n403\n00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.940\neven thousands, of templates that\nother people have posted out there.\n\n404\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.530\nSo it is very handy,\n\n405\n00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:32.130\nvery convenient the Pinbot one I know\nis really valuable to me as a PNP.\n\n406\n00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.050\nIf your PNP, if you've been\ncertified by the PMI product\n\n407\n00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.520\nmanagement you've got a certain\nway of doing things, and\n\n408\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.700\nit's nice to have a product\nthat's structured that way.\n\n409\n00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.820\nOr maybe you do Prints Two project\nmanagement, so you can search and\n\n410\n00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.580\nthere are some generic templates up there\nthat have been defined for Prints Two.\n\n411\n00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.250\nYou just search and find it.\n\n412\n00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.710\nIt gives you a great starting point.\n\n413\n00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.700\nSo the lesson here is, with project,\nyou can start with a blank project and\n\n414\n00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.230\nset it up however you want, but\nit's gonna be a lot of work.\n\n415\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.000\nAnd so if you can, look for templates.\n\n416\n00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.320\nLook for\ntemplates that other people have made,\n\n417\n00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:06.260\nor take your own existing projects and\nturn them into templates that you can use.\n\n418\n00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.280\nThe other thing is, in your company,\nyou might be the only project manager.\n\n419\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.750\nOr you might be on a team of\n20 different project managers.\n\n420\n00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.860\nYou need consistency amongst\nall of your projects, so\n\n421\n00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.410\nthat all of your project managers are\nstructuring their projects the same way.\n\n422\n00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.270\nThat's really important.\n\n423\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.310\nWell, having a good template in place\nis what's going to enforce that.\n\n424\n00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.220\nIt's going to make sure that everybody\nis doing things the same way\n\n425\n00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.270\nespecially if you've got linked projects.\n\n426\n00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.280\nIf you have sub projects\nunderneath a parent project.\n\n427\n00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.590\nYou need the sub-projects being configured\nthe same way as the parent project.\n\n428\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.810\nUsing templates again,\nit will take care of that.\n\n429\n00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.580\nAnd make sure that you get\nthat consistent environment.\n\n430\n00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.300\n>> So Don, I went ahead and\npulled up a simple template for us, and\n\n431\n00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.790\njust so\nthat we can walk through it very easily.\n\n432\n00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.165\nNotice that this one I'm just\nselecting as new product launches,\n\n433\n00:21:48.165 --> 00:21:51.530\ncuz it was the next one down\nthere that was fairly small.\n\n434\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.030\nAnd I can even go ahead and enter in\na start date for this new project.\n\n435\n00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.680\nLet's say I wanna start at the beginning\nof August for this project.\n\n436\n00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.590\nAnd that's just saying, hey, when you\nbuild this template, go in and add in this\n\n437\n00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.930\nbasic information so I can customize\nit even right here at the beginning.\n\n438\n00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.040\nAnd select Create.\n\n439\n00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.140\nAnd now it's gonna import that in.\n\n440\n00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.880\nAnd it actually has a full\ndifferent information,\n\n441\n00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.250\nthey've actually opened it\nup to the reports already.\n\n442\n00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.400\nSo that we can see in\nthis project overview,\n\n443\n00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.220\nthere's a bunch of\ndifferent reports there.\n\n444\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.190\nIf I select tasks and\n\n445\n00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:26.530\nthe gant chart view, this is more\nlikely what you're going to see.\n\n446\n00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:30.050\nAnd from here, even though I've\nselected a new project start date,\n\n447\n00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.450\nit actually went back to the 2005.\n\n448\n00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.250\nWhich means we need to\nmodify that information, but\n\n449\n00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.920\nnow I can save it as my new project and\nI'm ready to go.\n\n450\n00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.990\nI've now downloaded that template, so\nI don't have to go back out online and\n\n451\n00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.100\ndownload it again.\n\n452\n00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.260\nIt'll actually be available for\nme whether I'm online or offline, too.\n\n453\n00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.590\n>> All right, Ronnie, well I think\neverybody's gotten a pretty good chance\n\n454\n00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.870\nto see how we can create new projects,\nand how we can kinda get started.\n\n455\n00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.500\nAnd everybody's probably excited about\nactually putting this stuff to use.\n\n456\n00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.290\nWhich is what's gonna be happening\nin our upcoming episodes.\n\n457\n00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.920\nWell for this episode, this is probably\na pretty good point for us to stop.\n\n458\n00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.830\nRonnie do you have anything\nelse you wanted to throw in?\n\n459\n00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.080\n>> Not really,\nthere's just a lot to go through.\n\n460\n00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:05.720\nBut right there,\n\n461\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.240\nif you needed to get started right away,\nmultiple opportunities.\n\n462\n00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.860\nNotice you don't have to\nbe intimidated right away,\n\n463\n00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.910\nyou can use any of the options\nthat we showed you.\n\n464\n00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.370\nIt's a great way to start.\n\n465\n00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:15.430\n>> Absolutely.\n\n466\n00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.230\nAll right, well I hope you guys enjoyed\nwatching the episode as much as we\n\n467\n00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.970\ndid filming it.\n\n468\n00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.070\nStay tuned because we've got\nmore Project content coming up.\n\n469\n00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.350\nBut for now, signing of for\nITPro TV I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n470\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.910\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n471\n00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:27.466\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n472\n00:23:27.466 --> 00:23:33.030\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.338\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:18.087\nI'm your host Don Pezet back\nagain with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:18.838\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:21.526\n>> It is going well today,\nfeeling good and feeling excited,\n\n7\n00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:24.740\ncuz we're taking a look at\nMicrosoft Project again.\n\n8\n00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.689\n>> Now we're gonna take\na look at a topic today,\n\n9\n00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.421\nthat's really important we get right,\nearly in the project.\n\n10\n00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:31.129\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz it's hard to fix later on.\n\n11\n00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.462\nAnd that's setting our calendars.\n\n12\n00:00:33.462 --> 00:00:37.701\nIn our first episode, we talked a little\nbit about creating tasks in Project, and\n\n13\n00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:41.213\nwe still had to import those, and\nget our project kinda kicked off.\n\n14\n00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:44.888\nBut if you're starting with a blank\nproject, and you're about to enter in\n\n15\n00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:48.970\na bunch of tasks, well, if you're\njust entering in a name, that's fine.\n\n16\n00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.570\nBut if you're gonna start assigning\ndurations, how long a task takes to\n\n17\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.620\ncomplete, it's really important that\nwe have our calendar set first.\n\n18\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.585\nNow, if you're wondering\nwhat I mean by calendars,\n\n19\n00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:03.200\ncuz we kind of know the calendar.\n\n20\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.380\nJune 2nd is June 2nd, right?\n\n21\n00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.961\nBut, what are the work hours on June 2nd?\n\n22\n00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:12.987\nWhat times can I expect employees\nto be at the office doing work, and\n\n23\n00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:15.046\nat what time do they need to leave?\n\n24\n00:01:15.046 --> 00:01:19.000\nHow many hours of labor can\nI actually get on June 2nd?\n\n25\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.920\nWell, your calendar's what defines that.\n\n26\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.530\nAnd if you start putting in a bunch\nof activities and then you go and\n\n27\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.750\nchange that calendar,\nit can really cause some bizarre effects.\n\n28\n00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.550\nSo it's a great idea to\nget your calendars set up\n\n29\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.230\nbefore you start dumping in a bunch\nof durations onto your activities.\n\n30\n00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.664\nNow, If you just imported from Excel or\nsomewhere like that you may already have\n\n31\n00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:45.046\nsome durations, just expect to see them\nchange as your calendar changes too.\n\n32\n00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:47.810\nAnd you'll have to be observing,\nyou'll have to watch out for that.\n\n33\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.170\n>> When you start taking a look\nat changing the calendar,\n\n34\n00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.620\nyou gotta remember something which\nis very difficult to remember.\n\n35\n00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.470\nProject doesn't really look at time\n\n36\n00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.020\nas far as resources as being\na 24-hour day by default.\n\n37\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.587\nIt looks at it as being a regular workday,\nlike what you and I might experience.\n\n38\n00:02:04.587 --> 00:02:09.345\nAbout 8 AM until about noon, and\nthen you take an hour break, and\n\n39\n00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:14.970\nthen about 1 PM until about 5 PM, and\nthen, of course, you're off work.\n\n40\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.050\nSo they account for\nsomething like an eight hour day.\n\n41\n00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.870\nBut, you might find yourself, though,\n\n42\n00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.770\nin a project in which it\ndoesn't follow those times.\n\n43\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.148\nOr you might have projects in which\nthere's certain tasks which don't follow\n\n44\n00:02:27.148 --> 00:02:28.879\nthat particular time as well.\n\n45\n00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.793\nSo Project gives us the ability, then,\nto change the calendar and to actually\n\n46\n00:02:33.793 --> 00:02:38.820\nbe able to manipulate that to do\nthe things that we really want it to do.\n\n47\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.001\nSo let's go ahead and show you an example\nof what we're talking about by default,\n\n48\n00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.046\nthe way that Project actually\nsets up the calendar.\n\n49\n00:02:44.046 --> 00:02:44.871\nNow I went ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:48.326\njust pulled up an original Project plan\nthat I have used in the past, and that way\n\n51\n00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:52.160\nwe can kind of see some of the different\nthings that are actually out there.\n\n52\n00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.212\nAnd from here you don't see a lot.\n\n53\n00:02:54.212 --> 00:02:58.070\nIf I click on Task you actually\nsee the ribbon kind of drop down.\n\n54\n00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.600\nAnd what we're looking for\nis under the Project tab.\n\n55\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.147\nAnd then under Project under\nthe Properties section you're looking for\n\n56\n00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:07.961\nwhere it says Change Working Times.\n\n57\n00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:09.868\nAnd if I select that option,\n\n58\n00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:14.560\nthis is where we go to actually\ntake a look the project itself.\n\n59\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.816\nBy default, inside of Microsoft Project,\n\n60\n00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:22.754\nthere's really three standard,\nwhat we call, base calendars.\n\n61\n00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:27.926\nThere's a 24 hour calendar, there is\ngoing to be a night shift calendar and\n\n62\n00:03:27.926 --> 00:03:30.410\nthen there is a standard calendar.\n\n63\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.680\nNow, mine on this project because\nI actually created some different\n\n64\n00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.238\nworking times as well,\nyou actually see a lot more.\n\n65\n00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:41.740\nBut those are normally the defaults\nthere is standard, the 24 hour and\n\n66\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.870\nthe shift calendar.\n\n67\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.140\nSo usually this is the one that's done by\ndefault and if you take a look at some\n\n68\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.800\nof the details that are reported over here\nunder properties it says working times for\n\n69\n00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.050\nthis date,\naccording to this default calendar.\n\n70\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.190\nThere is the 8 to 12 and\n\n71\n00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.060\nthen the 1 to 5 with that one hour break,\nand then it actually does nothing else.\n\n72\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.230\nSo if I actually use this\nlittle arrow down button here,\n\n73\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.900\nyou can see it doesn't list anything.\n\n74\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.505\nIt doesn't actually include\nthings like holidays or anything.\n\n75\n00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:10.289\nIt just says, look, you're normally\nlooking at a five day workweek,\n\n76\n00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:14.730\neight hours a day, and that's what we're\ngonna get by default if we choose that.\n\n77\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.550\nAnd here in the US,\na 40 hour work week is pretty common.\n\n78\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.754\nIn your country it may be different,\nright?\n\n79\n00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:23.440\nThere's some people that have much\nshorter ones, even longer ones.\n\n80\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.060\nFor us in the US this is important for\nus to know because after 40 hours\n\n81\n00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.210\nwe have to start paying overtime,\nand overtime is more expensive.\n\n82\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.150\nSo if I have an employee and\nI schedule them work,\n\n83\n00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.950\nI should be able to expect to get 40 hours\nof work out of them at a certain rate.\n\n84\n00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.630\nBut if they go over 40\nhours I gotta pay more so\n\n85\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.680\nmy cost goes up and\nProject can help us to calculate that.\n\n86\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.470\nIt's not saying they can't work outside\nof these times, but it's saying if they\n\n87\n00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.538\ndo work outside of these times,\nwe're gonna have to pay them more money.\n\n88\n00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:54.860\nSo that's why it's important\nto designate these and\n\n89\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.970\nget them as close to accurate as possible.\n\n90\n00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.548\nEven the lunch breaks are important\nbecause if you're managing a very short\n\n91\n00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:05.712\nproject, you've gotta know,\nhour by hour where employees are at.\n\n92\n00:05:05.712 --> 00:05:06.978\nIf this is a five year project,\n\n93\n00:05:06.978 --> 00:05:09.820\nwe probably don't care about\nwhen lunch is on Wednesday.\n\n94\n00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.948\nBut if this is a two week project,\n\n95\n00:05:11.948 --> 00:05:15.525\nwe really do care about when\npeople are on lunch or gone.\n\n96\n00:05:15.525 --> 00:05:19.426\nNow, when you create a calendar, the\ncalendar that Ronnie is showing us, that's\n\n97\n00:05:19.426 --> 00:05:23.705\nthe standard calendar, which is basically\nour default calendar for the project.\n\n98\n00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:30.490\nAnd it may be the only calendar you have\nif everything conforms to that calendar.\n\n99\n00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.740\nBut there are plenty of other\ncalendars you might create.\n\n100\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.750\nFor example, resource calendars, right?\n\n101\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.219\nWhat if I have two employees, and one of\nthem, let's say Ronnie, works 8 to 5.\n\n102\n00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:47.072\nBut to keep keep the project moving\nI decide that I'm gonna come in and\n\n103\n00:05:47.072 --> 00:05:50.930\nI'm gonna work from 1 to\n10 in the evening, right?\n\n104\n00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.925\nSo I'm still gonna work\nan eight hour shift, right,\n\n105\n00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:56.530\n1 to 10 with a one hour\nlunch break in there.\n\n106\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.070\nSo maybe I'll work,\nwhat does that work out to?\n\n107\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.590\nLike 1 to 5 and then 6 to 10 PM,\nso in the evening.\n\n108\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.545\nSo I'm gonna come in and\nwork that evening shift, and\n\n109\n00:06:05.545 --> 00:06:10.087\nnow there's an employee at the office\nfrom 8 AM all the way until 10 PM, right?\n\n110\n00:06:10.087 --> 00:06:11.990\nWe've got that kind of coverage.\n\n111\n00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.171\nWell, by doing that, I'm working\na different calendar than Ronnie.\n\n112\n00:06:16.171 --> 00:06:21.040\nI might still be putting in 40 hours that\nweek, but at different times than him.\n\n113\n00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.150\nSo we can create alternate\ncalendars to reflect that.\n\n114\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.330\nTo say, it's okay for\nDon to be working 1 to 10.\n\n115\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.338\nIt's okay for\nRonnie to be working from 8 to 5.\n\n116\n00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:33.670\nAnd those resource calendars don't\nnecessarily just apply to people,\n\n117\n00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.600\nthey could apply to things, right?\n\n118\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.020\nMaybe we've got a truck or\nsome kind of equipment that's\n\n119\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.570\navailable during certain times of the day,\nI can create a calendar for that too.\n\n120\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.238\nSo for example, maybe I can get\na rental truck Monday, Tuesday, and\n\n121\n00:06:51.238 --> 00:06:54.713\nWednesday of the third week in July and\nthat's it.\n\n122\n00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:58.682\nI could create a calendar that reflects\nthose days for that rental truck and\n\n123\n00:06:58.682 --> 00:06:59.379\nthat's it.\n\n124\n00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.595\nAnd that way when I schedule that truck,\n\n125\n00:07:01.595 --> 00:07:05.725\nI'll see that it's only got that\nlimited window of availability.\n\n126\n00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:09.767\nCalendars can be very powerful for\nmaking sure we choose the right people and\n\n127\n00:07:09.767 --> 00:07:11.534\nthe right equipment for a job, or\n\n128\n00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:14.462\nat least making sure the tasks\noccur at the right time.\n\n129\n00:07:14.462 --> 00:07:18.941\nIf that truck's only available those three\ndays, and I have a task that requires that\n\n130\n00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:21.870\ntruck, I can't have that\ntask occur earlier or later.\n\n131\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.660\nIt's stuck within those days, cuz that's\nthe only time I've got that truck.\n\n132\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.671\nAnd the calendars are what\nhelps to determine that.\n\n133\n00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:32.021\n>> It really does help keep track of\nthings, especially when you're talking\n\n134\n00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:35.190\nabout resources and tasks and\nthe overall project itself.\n\n135\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.760\nSo if you select one of these calendars,\nit's perfectly fine.\n\n136\n00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.430\nIf you actually didn't do anything else,\nbut say all right that's fine with me and\n\n137\n00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.700\nyou click OK, you're ready to go.\n\n138\n00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.878\nBut remember that what\nI just showed you here.\n\n139\n00:07:44.878 --> 00:07:49.892\nIf I know that there are going to be\nholidays for my company that's coming up,\n\n140\n00:07:49.892 --> 00:07:54.691\nwell, notice that those are not actually\nset for what we have available.\n\n141\n00:07:54.691 --> 00:07:55.669\nWell that means,\n\n142\n00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:59.717\nI wanna actually create a calendar That\nthen will allow me to change that.\n\n143\n00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:03.922\nTo actually account for things so here in\nthe states we actually have what we call\n\n144\n00:08:03.922 --> 00:08:07.320\nLabor Day, right,\nwhich is coming up in the near future.\n\n145\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.830\nAbout two months away or\nso maybe not that long.\n\n146\n00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.050\nI think it's actually the seventh here.\n\n147\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.200\nWell we can also go ahead and\naccount for that and\n\n148\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.410\nmake that a non-working day as well.\n\n149\n00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.810\nNow the way that we do that is we don't\nwant to modify the standard calendar and\n\n150\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.310\nyou may be wondering why.\n\n151\n00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.890\nWhy not modify the standard calendar and\n\n152\n00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.620\nmake sure that that accounts for\neverything?\n\n153\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.270\nBecause I may be working on\nmultiple different projects, and\n\n154\n00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.640\nif I do that, when I modify the standard\ncalendar that means any new project that I\n\n155\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.910\ncreate will also have those, too, and\nwhat if that particular project says, no.\n\n156\n00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:37.590\nWe're not taking any holidays.\n\n157\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.150\nWe're working through because\nwe have to get it done.\n\n158\n00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.920\nWell, then they have to go back in and\nchange all that stuff.\n\n159\n00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.280\nSo what you would do instead is you\ntake this standard calendar and\n\n160\n00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.730\nover here on the right hand side,\nyou select Create a New Calendar.\n\n161\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.740\nAnd from this point, I'm just going to\nmake a copy of the standard calendar but\n\n162\n00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.890\nI'm going to modify.\n\n163\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:09:00.690\nBut then, I can go ahead and I will just\ncall this one Terminal Server Project\n\n164\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.610\nhere, and click OK.\n\n165\n00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.770\nWhen I do that,\nnotice the name changes but\n\n166\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.360\nall of the defaults that they have\navailable, pretty much are right there.\n\n167\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.710\nBut then it's down here at the bottom that\nwe can change the non working times and\n\n168\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.410\nthe working times.\n\n169\n00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.050\nNotice exceptions means days off,\nor time off, hours off,\n\n170\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.480\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n171\n00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.680\nThen, here's the default work week.\n\n172\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.470\nSo, here it actually says what\nthe default work week is.\n\n173\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.090\nIf this actually says, look,\nwe're not working from eight to five,\n\n174\n00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.540\nwe're working from midnight\nto nine in the morning,\n\n175\n00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.150\nwhatever it might be, you can change that\nfor everything in that project as well.\n\n176\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.290\nSo, I want to go ahead and\n\n177\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:39.570\nset this up for some of the different\nholidays that I might have.\n\n178\n00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.890\nSo, I'm going to scroll on the calendar,\nand I'm going to select the seventh, and\n\n179\n00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:49.000\nI'm going to call this one Labor Day,\nand then, If I went ahead and\n\n180\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.600\nselected it up here, I click on Start,\nand notice it adds the date right in.\n\n181\n00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.510\nAnd that now becomes an non-standard or\n\n182\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.520\nan exception day,\nwhich means no work's being incurred.\n\n183\n00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.850\nSo notice if I select the 14th,\nit shows me the working time.\n\n184\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.300\nIf I select the seventh, it says there's\nno working time that's available there.\n\n185\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.990\nSo then of course, you can do the same\nthing as you actually move on.\n\n186\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.158\nSo here,\nbecause I am actually in the States again,\n\n187\n00:10:13.158 --> 00:10:15.679\nwe have our Thanksgiving holiday, too.\n\n188\n00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:20.730\nAnd so here is the 26th,\nI believe is what's happening this year.\n\n189\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.105\nAnd if we actually did\nhave another day off,\n\n190\n00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:27.235\nI can actually select more than one day,\nby selecting two days.\n\n191\n00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:29.825\nI just clicked on the shift and\nthen selected that.\n\n192\n00:10:29.825 --> 00:10:31.715\nAnd that actually allows\nme to provide that too.\n\n193\n00:10:32.855 --> 00:10:35.780\nSo, you can actually select\nmore than one holiday.\n\n194\n00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.961\nAre more than one day at a time.\n\n195\n00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:44.053\n>> Yeah, and this is a great example of\nsomething that you might wanna be part of\n\n196\n00:10:44.053 --> 00:10:46.120\nyour default project template.\n\n197\n00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.860\nSo if you're gonna be creating\nnumerous projects, and\n\n198\n00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.420\nthey're all gonna observe these holidays.\n\n199\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.200\nYou could punch them in them and\nturn that into your template.\n\n200\n00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.720\nThat way, when you create new projects,\nthey've already got those values in there.\n\n201\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.070\nBut projects usually have their own\nlittle special exemptions or whatever,\n\n202\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.430\nand so we do still have to go in and\n\n203\n00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.070\ncustomize things just a little bit\njust to get our project current.\n\n204\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.940\nBut the other thing you'll notice\nis as Ronnie is setting these up,\n\n205\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.300\nthere's no option to set\na recurring pattern.\n\n206\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.670\nAnd that's a little bit challenging for\nsome people.\n\n207\n00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.730\nBecause we know, Thanksgiving is\ngoing to occur every year on the,\n\n208\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.900\nit's the fourth Thursday of November.\n\n209\n00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.880\n>> Yes.\n>> Or third Thursday of November.\n\n210\n00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.540\nThat's kinda how it works.\n\n211\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.580\nSo we know there's a pattern to it.\n\n212\n00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.210\nBut Project doesn't let us\nset up a repeating pattern.\n\n213\n00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.110\nSo if this is gonna be a five-year\nproject, I'd need to add five\n\n214\n00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.320\nLabor Days and five Thanksgivings\nto put those in and lay them out.\n\n215\n00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.730\nSo it does take a bit of work, and\nthat's where templates can come in handy.\n\n216\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.060\n>> I'm not gonna fill out anymore, but\n\n217\n00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.780\nyou kinda see the example\nof where you can do that.\n\n218\n00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.400\nWe, of course, here,\nwould still have Christmas holidays, and\n\n219\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.800\nthen New Years Day, and\nyou continue to fill on in from there.\n\n220\n00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.910\nFor your national holidays if you have\nthose, you want to make sure that people\n\n221\n00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.910\nare not gonna be accounted for\nthat day to work then you can select that.\n\n222\n00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.230\nNow once you create that calendar, right?\n\n223\n00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:59.036\nYou're not done yet because by\ndefault the calendar is not applied.\n\n224\n00:11:59.036 --> 00:12:03.328\nSo you create the calendar and\nthen I can go back into Project, and\n\n225\n00:12:03.328 --> 00:12:08.089\nthen Project Information, and from here,\nI am looking for right here so\n\n226\n00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:12.167\nthe calendar might actually be\nthe terminal server project.\n\n227\n00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:15.857\nAnd then that way, I'm actually\napplying it to the overall project, and\n\n228\n00:12:15.857 --> 00:12:18.660\nit will follow that schedule and\nits timeline.\n\n229\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.430\nAnd that way, when we assign work,\nwhen we do that, it sees those holidays.\n\n230\n00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.760\nIt's not gonna assign anybody\nto work on those days too.\n\n231\n00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.190\n>> Yeah, so if you were to\nschedule a task around Labor Day,\n\n232\n00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.130\nit would skip over Labor Day and\npush on past it.\n\n233\n00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.830\nAnd that's really important,\nbecause if the company is closed that day,\n\n234\n00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.930\nyou're not gonna any work done.\n\n235\n00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.050\nYou don't want your project to reflect\nthat cuz you're just automatically gonna\n\n236\n00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.310\nend up behind schedule\ncuz you lost a workday.\n\n237\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.970\nNow that counted there, Ronnie,\nthat's for the project as a whole.\n\n238\n00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.440\nWhat about an employee?\n\n239\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.800\nSo with an employee,\nyou might have differing work times,\n\n240\n00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.880\nyou might not, right?\n\n241\n00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.800\nAt a minimum, your employees\nprobably have some vacation time.\n\n242\n00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.300\nAnd Ronnie, we're friends and all, but\nwe don't take vacation on the same days.\n\n243\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.660\n>> No.\n>> So if I wanna\n\n244\n00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.580\nkeep track of Ronnie's vacation\nseparate from my vacation, well,\n\n245\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.118\nthose are exceptions to the calendar,\nright?\n\n246\n00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.990\nI know I'm still an employee, but\nI'm not doing work this particular week.\n\n247\n00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.320\nSo I need the calendar to reflect that,\nand we do that with resource calendars.\n\n248\n00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.400\nCalendars on individual people.\n\n249\n00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.260\n>> When we talk about setting\nup a resource calendar,\n\n250\n00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.030\nyou can do it exactly from the same\nplace I showed you if you choose too.\n\n251\n00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.450\nBut for me logically it works better\nif I see the resource itself and\n\n252\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.350\nthen, okay,\nI'm gonna sign the calendar that way too.\n\n253\n00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.980\nSo the way I'd do that is,\nI go up to View, oops, hit View, and\n\n254\n00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.890\nI select the resource sheet, and here you\nactually see some of the different ones.\n\n255\n00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.190\nI just set up some generic\nresource names that are available.\n\n256\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.190\nAnd let's say that we are actually going\nto account for some holiday time for\n\n257\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.294\nthis network technician.\n\n258\n00:13:43.294 --> 00:13:47.040\nI can hopefully double-click on him.\n\n259\n00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.090\nAnd when you see this,\nwe can then select it right here.\n\n260\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.380\nNow, if I do this right\nhere where it says,\n\n261\n00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.430\nchange his default working times,\nnotice it gives me this working time here.\n\n262\n00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.350\nBut it's not actually\ncreating a new calendar.\n\n263\n00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.730\nThis is just saying, hey, look.\n\n264\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.940\nYou wanna account for him taking a day\noff or some time off here and there.\n\n265\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.620\nThat's fine, but, it's not\nactually going to apply except for\n\n266\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.560\nthis one instance when you're\nactually worried about it.\n\n267\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.580\nSo what I'm going to do instead,\nis go back to Project and\n\n268\n00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.410\nthen change to working time.\n\n269\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.170\nAnd it's from right here you\nnotice that it actually did select\n\n270\n00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.290\nthe network technician.\n\n271\n00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.820\nNow, I went ahead and\ncreated this a little bit earlier so\n\n272\n00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.050\nthat we could see it.\n\n273\n00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.090\nBut you'd do the same thing.\n\n274\n00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.050\nYou'd select that base calendar,\nyou'd select create a new calendar, and\n\n275\n00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.570\nthen type in the name.\n\n276\n00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.980\nSo here it is for that network technician.\n\n277\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.996\nOnce I select that then we can go in here\nand add in his holidays that he wants too.\n\n278\n00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:44.492\n>> So if he's got a vacation for\nthe week of July 27th,\n\n279\n00:14:44.492 --> 00:14:47.535\nyou can put that in here\nas non-working time.\n\n280\n00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:49.406\nAnd now if you had an activity and\n\n281\n00:14:49.406 --> 00:14:53.575\nthis pulls the resource assigned to\nit no work would get done that week.\n\n282\n00:14:53.575 --> 00:14:57.198\nAnd that's a good reflection of what's\ngoing on there, and you got two options,\n\n283\n00:14:57.198 --> 00:15:00.504\neither one, your activity is just going\nto take longer, you got to wait for\n\n284\n00:15:00.504 --> 00:15:01.626\nthat person to get back.\n\n285\n00:15:01.626 --> 00:15:05.481\nOr two, it's your cue to schedule somebody\nelse to work on that activity to say,\n\n286\n00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:09.180\nwell, I can't assign it to this guy,\nhe's going to be out of the office.\n\n287\n00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.770\nBut I've got Jane, she's going to be here.\n\n288\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.140\nLet me assign her to it.\n\n289\n00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.700\nIt helps you select the right person to\nwork on the activity and ensure that your\n\n290\n00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.920\nproject keeps moving forward even\nthough somebody's on vacation.\n\n291\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.270\nNow the more people you have\nworking on the project,\n\n292\n00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.850\nthat's the more vacations\nyou've got to keep track of.\n\n293\n00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.850\nThe more sick time that you've got\nto keep track of and other things.\n\n294\n00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.330\nBut that's all a part of\nproject management and\n\n295\n00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.450\nMicrosoft Project has the tools for that.\n\n296\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.115\n>> So normally,\nto finish out the rest of this,\n\n297\n00:15:36.115 --> 00:15:40.184\nonce you actually select those dates,\nI can then click on details and\n\n298\n00:15:40.184 --> 00:15:45.047\nit's from here that I wanna make sure\nthat I'm selecting the non-working time.\n\n299\n00:15:45.047 --> 00:15:49.216\nSo usually you have to delete these days\nout, or it's not gonna let you do that.\n\n300\n00:15:49.216 --> 00:15:53.687\nNo, I guess I just have to select, oop,\nnow, of course, it's balking at me.\n\n301\n00:15:53.687 --> 00:15:57.528\nNon-working, and\nI'm not gonna actually have it reoccur.\n\n302\n00:15:57.528 --> 00:16:00.930\nSet the proper day, end by that day.\n\n303\n00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.390\nAnd click okay.\n\n304\n00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.440\nThere we go.\n\n305\n00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.050\nSo, you just have to go in and\nmake sure that you set it, and\n\n306\n00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.055\nselect, once you do that.\n\n307\n00:16:08.055 --> 00:16:10.620\nCause if you did what I did at\nthe beginning which was, I selected it but\n\n308\n00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:15.290\nit still showed up as working times,\nyou always have to go into details and\n\n309\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.220\nmanually make sure you set it and\nthen click okay and\n\n310\n00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.960\nthen it will accept it at that point.\n\n311\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.810\nSo, now if the network technician is\nassigned to any work on that week,\n\n312\n00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:24.800\nit's not going to do it.\n\n313\n00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.160\nIt should actually go no there's not, and\nit's not gonna make them stop right, but\n\n314\n00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.050\nwhat it should show you is some type of\nindicator that hey you have over allocated\n\n315\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.200\nthis resource or something is going\non here that you need to check out.\n\n316\n00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.360\nSo, this may not be the best\ntime to do something.\n\n317\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:38.910\n>> Yeah.\n\n318\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.800\nNow, what Ronnie just did right there,\nthat's the most common example, right?\n\n319\n00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.700\nYou got vacation, or\nthey're gonna be out for\n\n320\n00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.220\nsome reason, and\nyou just block those days and they're out.\n\n321\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.380\nBut the times that Ronnie\nshowed you right there,\n\n322\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.940\nwhere he got mad at them because\nthey had both a time and\n\n323\n00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:55.490\na range, the place where we'd use\nthose times, you might have a person\n\n324\n00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.848\nwho is assigned to more than one\nproject at the same time, right?\n\n325\n00:16:58.848 --> 00:17:02.970\nWe kind a make this assumption that\na resource is gonna be working with\n\n326\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.550\nus the whole time, but maybe they're\nbeing split between two projects.\n\n327\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.850\nSo yeah,\nthey might work eight to five, but\n\n328\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.930\nwe can only have them from eight to noon.\n\n329\n00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:15.155\nAnd so you can adjust the times\nthat they're available to say, for\n\n330\n00:17:15.155 --> 00:17:18.108\nthis month we've only\ngot from eight to noon.\n\n331\n00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:20.220\nBecause they're working on\nsome other project too.\n\n332\n00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.430\nSo, that's one way we can do it.\n\n333\n00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.710\nWe'll see another one later on where\nwe have allocation that we can track.\n\n334\n00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.850\nAnd we can always set them\nto 50% allocation also,\n\n335\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:30.150\nthere's other ways to go about it but\nthe calendar, those times that Ronnie saw,\n\n336\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.100\nthat's where you would normally use\nthem to kind of restrict their time.\n\n337\n00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.670\nThat does happen.\n\n338\n00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.770\n>> Now, there are also other\ntimes when you do something\n\n339\n00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.420\nthat I just don't even think about.\n\n340\n00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.230\nWhich is you set a calendar for\na particular task as well, and\n\n341\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.360\nthe reason you might do something like\nthat is the example I always use, and\n\n342\n00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.700\nI think everyone uses is think about\npouring a foundation for a house and\n\n343\n00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:57.140\nyou just need to let is sit there and cure\nor dry overnight or however long it takes.\n\n344\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.180\nWell, that doesn't match some of\nthe standard calendars that we might have\n\n345\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.000\nright, the drying time is not\ngonna take a one hour lunch break,\n\n346\n00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.650\nit's not gonna do anything like that.\n\n347\n00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.870\nSo, instead what we can do is we\ncan actually take a single task and\n\n348\n00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.350\nalso assign unless they add 24\nhour calendar to that as well, and\n\n349\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.870\njust say look,\nthis is gonna take time over night but\n\n350\n00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:21.540\nit's not gonna affect the resources and\nhowever much we're gonna pay for\n\n351\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.030\nthat time to go on unless you are actually\nassigning someone to watch it overnight.\n\n352\n00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.990\nBut overall though, you can also do\nthat for an individual task too.\n\n353\n00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.570\nSo, you can set up a project calendar,\nyou can set one up for resource, and\n\n354\n00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.410\nif you need to, on something like\nthat where you're watching paint dry,\n\n355\n00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:40.250\nyou can also set up a calendar for\neven that task itself.\n\n356\n00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.565\n>> Yeah, and another example of\nwhere you use a task calendar,\n\n357\n00:18:42.565 --> 00:18:43.670\ncause they aren't terribly common.\n\n358\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.450\nBut if you're sub-contracting\nsomething out, right?\n\n359\n00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.970\nSo let's go back to that construction\nidea, you're building a house, and\n\n360\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.490\nyou know you need drywall\nput up in the house.\n\n361\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:53.490\nBut you're not gonna do it.\n\n362\n00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.850\nYou're gonna subcontract it out.\n\n363\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:59.250\nSo, you've got a subcontractor comes\nto you and says, my team will work\n\n364\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.950\nfrom 8 am until dark, 8 AM to 8 PM every\nday and we'll get that drywall up, right.\n\n365\n00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.270\nThat's not your normal schedule.\n\n366\n00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.590\nYour normal schedule is 8 to 5.\n\n367\n00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.820\nBut the company you're contracting with,\nthey're not following that, right.\n\n368\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.490\nThey'll work a bigger time.\n\n369\n00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.577\nAnd you don't necessarily\nhave resources for\n\n370\n00:19:15.577 --> 00:19:19.017\nthat contractor because you don't\nknow the employees they're gonna use.\n\n371\n00:19:19.017 --> 00:19:20.150\nYou're just subcontracting out.\n\n372\n00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.290\nLet them worry about it.\n\n373\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.410\nSo, you might create a task\nthat says install drywall and\n\n374\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:29.520\ncreate a calendar just for\nthat task that's 8 AM to 8 PM for\n\n375\n00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.970\nthose days because that's what\nthe subcontractors said they're gonna do.\n\n376\n00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.370\nSo, it's a nice way to do that where\nyou're not managing the resources but\n\n377\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.940\nyou're not modifying your project as\na whole, it's just that particular task.\n\n378\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.950\n>> Now, Don I realize that even\nthough I went over the name of those\n\n379\n00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.600\nbase calendars, I didn't actually describe\nwhat each of them does a little bit.\n\n380\n00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.170\nSo, I'm gonna take a moment just to\nmake sure that we kind of emphasize\n\n381\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.240\nsome of these too.\n\n382\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.360\nSo, remember the standard calendar?\n\n383\n00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.310\nThat's the one I went\nover of course the most.\n\n384\n00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:58.180\nAnd it seems like I kinda glossed over\nthis 24 hour calendar and, of course,\n\n385\n00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:04.190\nthe night shift calendar, that's the one\nthat's also there by default as well.\n\n386\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.590\nSo, when you're doing the 24 hour\ncalendar, that has no breaks at all.\n\n387\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.430\nNotice that it actually goes from\n12:00 AM to 12:00 AM, and so\n\n388\n00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.880\nyou're not accounting for any breaks.\n\n389\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.190\nSo, normally that means you're\nnot gonna assign that to any one,\n\n390\n00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.530\nlet's say human resource,\nthat needs to take a break at all.\n\n391\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:23.570\nBut, for things like again the paint\ndrying, a task in which has to be done and\n\n392\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.830\nthat your not actually\ngonna take any breaks on so\n\n393\n00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.060\nyou normally don't actually assign it some\nsort of human calendar or human resource\n\n394\n00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.270\nthat your going to do and of course,\nthe different night shift counter.\n\n395\n00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.510\nIf you are actually going to that\nother night shift counter and\n\n396\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.110\neverybody actually has to work\na night shift, here it is too.\n\n397\n00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.110\nSomething that you know that is\nnot gonna be a standard work day,\n\n398\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.980\nyou might choose that as well.\n\n399\n00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.280\nSo, it only takes into\naccount the resources that,\n\n400\n00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.910\nI don't wanna say the resources.\n\n401\n00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:52.590\nIt actually allows you to shift everything\nto that night time place that, or\n\n402\n00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.060\nthat nighttime, or those night time hours\nto be able to do what we need to do.\n\n403\n00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:00.110\nAnd so it is kind of a neat idea here.\n\n404\n00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:04.720\nIf you actually need to shift the entire\nproject itself to another schedule.\n\n405\n00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.313\n>> I never really understood\nthe night project one [LAUGH],\n\n406\n00:21:07.313 --> 00:21:08.867\nbecause it's 11 PM to 12 AM.\n\n407\n00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.520\nThat's just one hour, isn't it Ronnie?\n\n408\n00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.250\n>> Well it actually,\nit's almost 25 hours altogether.\n\n409\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:14.820\nI don't know why.\n\n410\n00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:15.850\n>> Is it wrapped around a day?\n\n411\n00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.150\n>> I think it wraps around the day,\nif I remember correctly on that one.\n\n412\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.465\nBut yeah.\nI've never understood that one either,\n\n413\n00:21:20.465 --> 00:21:21.620\ncause I've never used it.\n\n414\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.260\n>> Yeah, so\nthat there's just three by default.\n\n415\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.430\nI know Ronnie had some others.\n\n416\n00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.680\nBut there's the standard,\nthe 24-hour and the night shift.\n\n417\n00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.928\nThere's actually a none that you can end\nup with if your project is screwed up.\n\n418\n00:21:32.928 --> 00:21:34.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And that's not the greatest.\n\n419\n00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.289\nBut with none, that meaning\nthere is no standard calendar.\n\n420\n00:21:38.289 --> 00:21:39.553\nIt's assuming, on every task and\n\n421\n00:21:39.553 --> 00:21:41.700\nresource, that you're gonna\nmanually define the days.\n\n422\n00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.300\nIt's a really hard way to go about things,\n\n423\n00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.560\nbut if you've got super disparate\ncalendars all over the place,\n\n424\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.820\ninstead of creating a bunch of separate\nones, you could manage them individually.\n\n425\n00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.150\nI find that's a terrible idea.\n\n426\n00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.380\nBut, you can create as many\nother calendars as you want, and\n\n427\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:00.450\nthis is just another area where,\nif you're gonna be creating more projects,\n\n428\n00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.120\ninstead of creating one from scratches,\nit's a good idea to clone an existing\n\n429\n00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.180\nproject so you get all their\ncalendars that come along with it.\n\n430\n00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.270\nThat can be pretty handy.\n\n431\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:11.090\nNow, where things get even more\nchallenging is if you've got employees who\n\n432\n00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.550\nare working more than one project,\ntracking those calendars.\n\n433\n00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:19.620\nAnd inside of a single project like this\nthere's not a great solution for it.\n\n434\n00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:24.690\nWe'll talk toward the end of the series\nabout one solution, but the best solution\n\n435\n00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.820\nis something outside of Microsoft Project,\nit's called Microsoft Project Server.\n\n436\n00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.940\nWith Microsoft Project Server you\ncan create a resource pool and\n\n437\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.390\nyou have all your employees in that pool\nand they can all have their own calendars.\n\n438\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.380\nAnd when you bring them\nin to your project, well,\n\n439\n00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.030\nit brings them along with their calendar.\n\n440\n00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.070\nAnd even shows when they're\nbusy with other projects.\n\n441\n00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.110\nSo, if you're managing more\nthan one project at a time and\n\n442\n00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.780\nresources are being shared amongst those\nprojects, you really need to look into\n\n443\n00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.767\nMicrosoft Projects Server to ensure\nyou handle that properly, right.\n\n444\n00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.120\nBut if you got dedicated resources,\nyou can do it right here in project, and\n\n445\n00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.060\nthere are ways to create resource pools\nwithout project server, but I'll tell you,\n\n446\n00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.810\nthey're not terribly effective if you\nhave more than one project manager.\n\n447\n00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.580\nIf you just have one project manager you\ncan actually do it without project server.\n\n448\n00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.500\nBut most people have more than one project\nmanager and that doesn't work out so well.\n\n449\n00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.090\n>> One last thing I want to make\nsure that we also take a look at to,\n\n450\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.520\nwhich is to understand that when\nI set up a project calendar and\n\n451\n00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:23.570\nI set up a resource calendar, well\nwhich one actually takes place, right?\n\n452\n00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.935\nBecause you have two\nconflicting calendars now.\n\n453\n00:23:25.935 --> 00:23:28.010\nThat one that's for\nthe overall project and one for\n\n454\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.650\nthe resource, well there is an override.\n\n455\n00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.540\nIn other words, if you set up\na project calendar by itself and\n\n456\n00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.620\nyou're not using any resource calendars,\nthat's the one that's going to apply.\n\n457\n00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.620\nBut what you're trading with those\nresource calendars are really exceptions\n\n458\n00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.760\nto the overall calendar itself.\n\n459\n00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.540\nSo, if you do end up finding that\nyou have two of them assigned,\n\n460\n00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.530\na resource calendar and\na project calendar, for\n\n461\n00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.670\nthat resource it will override\nthat project calendar schedule.\n\n462\n00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:52.850\nOnly for that one resource though.\n\n463\n00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.190\nNot for everybody else,\nbut for that one resource.\n\n464\n00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.670\nIt might be something you see later on,\nsuch as an exam.\n\n465\n00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.110\n>> And\nyou could end up in a three way conflict.\n\n466\n00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.310\nYou could have a task calendar,\nand a resource calendar, and\n\n467\n00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.880\na project calendar that all conflict.\n\n468\n00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.310\nAnd in that scenario,\nthe task calendar actually wins.\n\n469\n00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.760\nThe idea is, maybe your project's\ngetting behind schedule.\n\n470\n00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.660\nAnd your project calendar says\neverybody works from eight to five.\n\n471\n00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.320\nAnd you've got this one employee\nwho has his own calendar that says\n\n472\n00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.240\nhe's taking the day off on Monday.\n\n473\n00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.670\nAnd then on that task, you reach out to\nthat employee and say, can you come in and\n\n474\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:27.720\nwork on Monday?\n\n475\n00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.440\nAnd they say, all right.\n\n476\n00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.460\nWe can do that.\n\n477\n00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.560\nYou might wanna leave on their calendar\nthat they were off on Monday, but\n\n478\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.770\nthen add a task calendar item that says\nthey're gonna be here working on Monday to\n\n479\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:38.990\ncreate the exception.\n\n480\n00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.940\nSo, at the end of the day that\ntask is the final override.\n\n481\n00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.870\nNow, what I always trying to\ndo is I try not to use task\n\n482\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.150\ncalendars if I can avoid it.\n\n483\n00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:50.260\nI try and just have the project calendar\nand the resource calendars and that's it.\n\n484\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.950\nAnd the reason I try and keep it to two\nis, if you're trying to schedule somebody\n\n485\n00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.680\nand for some reason, it's not scheduling\non a day, you're gonna go and\n\n486\n00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.990\nfigure out where that block is happening\nand just having two places is easier than\n\n487\n00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:03.630\nhaving three places to go and look, but\nthe task calendars are there for a reason.\n\n488\n00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.510\nMake use of them if you\nabsolutely need too.\n\n489\n00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.810\nAlright, well Ronnie I think that's\na pretty good overview of calendars and\n\n490\n00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.000\nI just want to reiterate that\nthe reason we're covering this so\n\n491\n00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.840\nsoon you guys can kind of see here, if you\nset up your project and you get all these\n\n492\n00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.940\ntasks put in place, and then you go modify\nyour calendar, all of your tasks are gonna\n\n493\n00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.100\nmove around to accommodate that new\ncalendar and it creates a lot of headache.\n\n494\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.330\nIf you have your calendar set right in the\nvery beginning, as you add task they'll\n\n495\n00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.480\nconform to it and you'll get a better\nvision of how your project is going to be.\n\n496\n00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.330\nSo, this is one of the first things\nthat we need to tackle when setting up\n\n497\n00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.010\na new project.\n\n498\n00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:35.940\n>> I agree.\n\n499\n00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.190\n>> All right, well, Ronnie, this is\nprobably a good spot to wrap this one up.\n\n500\n00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.660\nDo you have anything else you wanna add?\n\n501\n00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.930\n>> Nope,\njust continue to take a look into project.\n\n502\n00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.840\nThere's so many little things that\nyou can get easily confused in.\n\n503\n00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.410\nIf you're preparing for the exam,\nmake sure you spend time and\n\n504\n00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:52.120\nactually doing and working with it,\nbecause you're gonna forget so\n\n505\n00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.290\nmuch, so the more time you spend it,\nthe better it's gonna be.\n\n506\n00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.170\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, let's wrap this one up here.\n\n507\n00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.750\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n508\n00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.300\nSinging off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Tom Poset.\n\n509\n00:26:02.300 -->

00:00:17.363\nand welcome back to another episode of\nITProTV, and I'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:19.520\nBack again with Mr.\nRonnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.470\n>> It's going great today.\n\n6\n00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.660\nIt feels nice and good in our studio and\nthat means we're ready for\n\n7\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.142\nanother exciting episode and a project.\n\n8\n00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:29.620\n>> Yeah, now in Microsoft Project, I know\nI have mentioned in other episodes that\n\n9\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.500\nin the background it's really just\ncreating a Microsoft access database and\n\n10\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.080\nkind of hides that from us, right.\n\n11\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.460\nAnd the database is completely\nbuilt out to support projects.\n\n12\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.340\nSo it's got tables and columns, and\n\n13\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.430\nall of that other data, that's built\naround what we need to know for project.\n\n14\n00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.870\nAnd, when I say it's got columns and data.\n\n15\n00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.220\n>> It's got columns.\n\n16\n00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.100\n>> It's got tons and tons of data.\n\n17\n00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.850\nWhen you first launch Microsoft Project,\n\n18\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.850\nyou get a default view that has the stuff\nthat most of us expect to see, right?\n\n19\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.180\nLet's take a little tour here.\n\n20\n00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.410\nSo I've got a project\npulled up on my machine.\n\n21\n00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.290\nAnd this is just the default\ngant view that you see when you\n\n22\n00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.090\nfire up Microsoft Project.\n\n23\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.921\nSo you get a little gant chart over here,\nwhich I don't really care about.\n\n24\n00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.438\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me take that and\n\n25\n00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:09.592\nscoot it off to the side.\n\n26\n00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:10.759\nBut then you'll see some other things.\n\n27\n00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.343\nWe've got things like our task name,\nthe duration, or\n\n28\n00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:16.770\nhow long the task is gonna take.\n\n29\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.940\nWhen the task starts,\nwhen its scheduled to finish,\n\n30\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.600\nthe predecessors if it's linked to\nother tasks that have to happen.\n\n31\n00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.090\nThe resources,\nwho's assigned to that, right?\n\n32\n00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.290\nThese are all things that Microsoft\nknows that you're going to need, right?\n\n33\n00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.160\nThese are the default things.\n\n34\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.260\nBut boy, there's a lot more that's\nout there if you really want it.\n\n35\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.090\nAnd as we move through the different\nviews inside a project you'll see some of\n\n36\n00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.220\nthose other things.\n\n37\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.220\nBut notice right here I've\ngot this Add New Column.\n\n38\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.820\nYou can click that, and\nyou can add in other data.\n\n39\n00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.370\nAnd, it's an impressive list,\nthere's well over 200 things.\n\n40\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.860\n>> Yeah there really is.\n\n41\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.403\nThee's so many different others,\ndifferent tasks and\n\n42\n00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:57.647\ndifferent columns that we can add\nto there, that Microsoft said look,\n\n43\n00:01:57.647 --> 00:02:00.750\nthere's already stuff in here, and\nall you have to do is choose it.\n\n44\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.188\nThey don't want to actually add\neverything in and overwhelm it, and\n\n45\n00:02:04.188 --> 00:02:07.640\nall of a sudden you have a table\nthat's now 1,000 columns long.\n\n46\n00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.211\nBut as you go through there,\n\n47\n00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:13.337\nyou'll actually notice that they also\nput in some generic names in there,\n\n48\n00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:17.540\nsuch as text and number field, and\ncost field, and stuff like that.\n\n49\n00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.660\nThe reason why they did that is because\nthey also wanted projects to be\n\n50\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.990\ncustomizable.\n\n51\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.246\nAnd that means that if you are actually\nnot seeing what you need to see,\n\n52\n00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:29.924\nyou have the ability to build\nthe field that you need to see and\n\n53\n00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:33.336\nactually have it report\nthe information that you want.\n\n54\n00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:36.250\nOr maybe even change it up and\nreport some other things too.\n\n55\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.310\n>> Yeah, you know Microsoft\nbuilt this around the PMI,\n\n56\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.860\nthe Project Managers Institute's PMBOK or\ntheir Project Management Body of Knowledge\n\n57\n00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.070\nand so it's got a lot of stuff\nin here to support that.\n\n58\n00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.400\nBut even then you might be following\na different methodology or\n\n59\n00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.370\nyou might just have other\ninformation you wanna keep track of.\n\n60\n00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.520\nLet me give you a great example.\n\n61\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.590\nWhen we create a task, so\nI've got this task here,\n\n62\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.980\nsubmit bond and insurance documents, and\nI can see the resources assigned to it?\n\n63\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.610\nRight, we've got the project management\nteam and some kind of GC general, right?\n\n64\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.850\nSo we've got a couple of different\nthings here assigned to it.\n\n65\n00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.350\nThese are the resources\nthat are assigned to it.\n\n66\n00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.930\nThese are the people who\nare doing the actual work.\n\n67\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.630\nBut you might have a RAM,\na responsibility assignment matrix,\n\n68\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.130\nwhere you've assigned people\nto be responsible for a task.\n\n69\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.490\nThat means that person might not be\nthe person doing the actual work,\n\n70\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.070\nthey're just responsible for it.\n\n71\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.260\nSo if it doesn't happen, it's their fault.\n\n72\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.640\nThis is the person you blame.\n\n73\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.760\nWell in Project, we track the resource as\nthe person who's actually doing the work.\n\n74\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.870\nWe have to pay them money, but\n\n75\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.160\nthe person who's responsible for,\nwe might not be paying them money.\n\n76\n00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.730\nIt might be part of their job that\nthey just are responsible for\n\n77\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.880\nmaking this happen.\n\n78\n00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.120\nSo I might want to keep track of that, but\n\n79\n00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.530\nI don't have a responsible\nperson field in here.\n\n80\n00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.440\nIf I look I'm looking at all sorts of\nother stuff, but no responsible person.\n\n81\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.840\nSo I might wanna create a custom field,\nand to do that, all you have to do is,\n\n82\n00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.090\nyou can actually do it from right here,\nbut the easier way is up top here.\n\n83\n00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.830\nIf we go to Project,\nyou'll see Custom Fields, and\n\n84\n00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.380\nwhen you choose Custom Fields, we're gonna\nsee all those ones that Ronnie mentioned.\n\n85\n00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.640\nHere's text 1 through 20, right,\nor actually it's through 30.\n\n86\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.880\nSo, we've got 30 of these\nlittle text fields.\n\n87\n00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.582\nIf you change them from text, you've got\ncost, date, number, a number 1 through 20,\n\n88\n00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:21.576\nso some of them you have only 10 of,\nsome you have 20, some you have 30.\n\n89\n00:04:21.576 --> 00:04:24.093\nAnd what these are are fields\nthat Microsoft's already made and\n\n90\n00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:26.580\nthey're leaving them available for you.\n\n91\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.010\nSo you need to think about\nthe data you want to store.\n\n92\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.700\nI want to store the name of a person.\n\n93\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.940\nThis is the person I'm going to get\nmad at if this job doesn't finish.\n\n94\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.550\nSo a person's name, that's just text.\n\n95\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.090\nAnd so I'm gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna pick text.\n\n96\n00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.870\nAnd then I'm gonna take that text\nfield and I'm gonna rename it.\n\n97\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.520\nBecause text1 is not\nvery meaningful to me.\n\n98\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.730\nSo you can select it and hit Rename and\nyou can call it something.\n\n99\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.890\nI'll call it my RAM.\n\n100\n00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.990\nThis is my responsibility\nassignment matrix.\n\n101\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.070\nOr I could say,\nresponsible person, sponsor,\n\n102\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.430\nwhatever it is that I wanna call it, I'll\njust say responsible person, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.630\nAnd it's just gonna be a text field,\nand that's it.\n\n104\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.670\nNow the other options down here I'll talk\nabout in a minute, but for this one,\n\n105\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.400\nI'm gonna go ahead and say OK.\n\n106\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.940\nAnd now I've got this custom text field,\nand here in my project, I can hit,\n\n107\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.410\nadd a new column, and if I scroll down\nto text one, I can find text one.\n\n108\n00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.540\nAnd see how in parentheses it's\ngot that responsible person flag.\n\n109\n00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.290\nAnd I can choose it and\nit shows us responsible person.\n\n110\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.430\nI have to remember that it's called\ntext one because that's what it is in\n\n111\n00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.170\nthe database on the back end.\n\n112\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.870\nBut now I've got this responsible person\nfield, and I come in here and I can say,\n\n113\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.720\nthis one's gonna be Ronnie Wong.\n\n114\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.960\nOr this one's gonna be Don Pezet.\n\n115\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.160\nI'm gonna put in the people.\n\n116\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.290\nNow, these are not resources.\n\n117\n00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.020\nIf I go to my resource sheet,\nif I jump over to that,\n\n118\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.480\nI don't have a Ronnie Wong or\na Don Pezet here in the list.\n\n119\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.600\nWe're not resources,\nwe're not actually doing the work.\n\n120\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.430\nWe're just gonna be responsible for\nit, making sure it actually happens.\n\n121\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.320\nSo, when I go back to my Gantt chart,\nthere we go,\n\n122\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.230\nI've got my responsible persons.\n\n123\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.110\nSo, if you need number fields, if you need\nanything like that, you can quickly and\n\n124\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.980\neasily create them right here, all right?\n\n125\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.090\nLet me give you another example,\nthat's a little more advanced, right?\n\n126\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.760\nWell, we'll create a building example.\n\n127\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.310\nLet's say that you're responsible for\nrisk analysis, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.420\nWell, what do we do for risk analysis?\n\n129\n00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.240\nEvery activity, we can go in and take\na look at it and kind of figure out what\n\n130\n00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.330\nits risk might be, or whatever,\nand we kind of start to log that.\n\n131\n00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.440\nSo, you might want to create\na way to quickly measure\n\n132\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.290\nrisk right here from inside a project.\n\n133\n00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.370\nSo, you can take things like, well,\n\n134\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.280\nthe two building blocks of risk\nare probability and impact.\n\n135\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.915\nFor every risk you need\nto know the probability.\n\n136\n00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:39.690\nWhat's the likelihood of it happening?\n\n137\n00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.670\nAnd then you need to know the impact.\n\n138\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.830\nIf it does happen how\nbad's it going to be.\n\n139\n00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.450\nAnd we normally rank those\non a scale of one to ten.\n\n140\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.990\nSo those are just numbers.\n\n141\n00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.690\nI can take one of my number custom field\nand another number custom field and\n\n142\n00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.500\nI could make them probability and\nimpact, right?\n\n143\n00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.190\nSo I'm going to do that here, I'm just\ngoing to go back to my custom fields.\n\n144\n00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.910\nSo I'm going to go to my project tab and\nto custom fields.\n\n145\n00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.459\nI'm going to switch to\nthe number type right here, and\n\n146\n00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:11.243\nI'll take number one, I'm going to\nrename that one as Probability, and\n\n147\n00:07:11.243 --> 00:07:15.430\nthen I'll take number two and\nI'm going to rename that Impact.\n\n148\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.520\nSo now I've got probability and impact,\n\n149\n00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.040\nthey're just numbers, and I can put\ndata in there, and it's no big deal.\n\n150\n00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.620\nI can go through and start to rank things\nby giving them that 1 through 10 value.\n\n151\n00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.490\nSo if I add some new columns here,\nI'm gonna add number 1 and number 2.\n\n152\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.374\nI've gotta remember what the columns\nare originally called, so\n\n153\n00:07:36.374 --> 00:07:42.694\nI'm just gonna come in here and add those\nguys, so I'll add Number1 and Number2.\n\n154\n00:07:42.694 --> 00:07:43.790\nThere we go.\n\n155\n00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.823\nAnd once we get them added in, and\nI'm just gonna kind of move these guys,\n\n156\n00:07:47.823 --> 00:07:51.748\ncause my screen's gonna keep bumping\naround here as I move this stuff.\n\n157\n00:07:51.748 --> 00:07:52.683\nAll right, there we go.\n\n158\n00:07:52.683 --> 00:07:54.349\nSo I've got my probability.\n\n159\n00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:57.173\nAnd my impact and\nthey're all zeroed out, right?\n\n160\n00:07:57.173 --> 00:07:59.720\nI put numbers as the data type.\n\n161\n00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.810\nSo, just put a zero in each of them but\nI can start going through and\n\n162\n00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:09.650\njust kinda ranking them based on whatever\nit was that I felt like these were.\n\n163\n00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.382\nWhoops [LAUGH] 12.\n\n164\n00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:11.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna try and\n\n165\n00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.140\nkeep it one to ten so, for\nmy probabilities and then for\n\n166\n00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.010\nmy impact the same kinda thing right?\n\n167\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.160\nWe'd go through and we'd punch in what we\nthink the impact on our organization will\n\n168\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.710\nbe and your ranking scale is\nyour own to choose, right?\n\n169\n00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.360\nSo, it's whatever kinda works out.\n\n170\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.190\nAll right.\n\n171\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.360\nSo, now that I've got those punched in,\nI've got probability and impact.\n\n172\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.780\nThat was easy, I just used some custom\nfields for that but to really have risk\n\n173\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.920\nwork, I need my risk index and\nyour risk index, or your\n\n174\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.010\nrisk rating is what most people call it,\nIt's where I factor these two together.\n\n175\n00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.750\nRight.\nIf I have something that's really\n\n176\n00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.010\nlow probability but high impact,\nit's a little probability.\n\n177\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.710\nIt's not gonna happen.\n\n178\n00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.750\nI don't worry about it but\nif it's a low impact and\n\n179\n00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.280\na high probability,\nI'm not worry about it there too.\n\n180\n00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.490\nHigh probability is gonna happen but\nthe impact is so low.\n\n181\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.430\nI'm not worry about it but when it's in\nbetween, when the probability and impact\n\n182\n00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.290\nare both in the middle It's likely to\nhappen, and it's gonna cause a big impact.\n\n183\n00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.110\nI need to plan for that.\n\n184\n00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.320\nSo, we need to average\nthese numbers together, or\n\n185\n00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.920\nwe usually just multiply them\ntogether to get the value we want.\n\n186\n00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.720\nSo, I'm gonna add another column,\nwhich is gonna be my risk rating.\n\n187\n00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.510\nNow this time I want risk\nrating to be a number but\n\n188\n00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.190\nit's not going to be a number that I\ntype in because I'm bad at math and\n\n189\n00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:29.100\nI make mistakes so I want it to\ncalculate the number for me right?\n\n190\n00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.420\nFigure out this number for me.\n\n191\n00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.480\nDon't make me have to type it in.\n\n192\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.200\nOkay so, I'm going to go up\nhere to my custom fields and\n\n193\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.560\nI'm going to take number three and I'm\ngoing to rename this my risk rating but\n\n194\n00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.040\ninstead of being something I type in,\nI'm going to have it calculate the value.\n\n195\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.520\nRight here under custom attributes,\nthe default is none.\n\n196\n00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.930\nI'm not going to put a value in there.\n\n197\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.190\nI'm going to manually type in values.\n\n198\n00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:58.520\nYou can do a lookup where it queried\nsome other value and brought that in or\n\n199\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.640\nyou can do a formula, and the formula,\nthat's where the real power is.\n\n200\n00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.350\nNow when I choose formula,\nit's warning me,\n\n201\n00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.540\nif I have anything in those fields\nright now, it's gonna erase them.\n\n202\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.510\nWell, I just created it,\nso it's empty anyway.\n\n203\n00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.780\nI don't care about that.\n\n204\n00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.660\nI'll say OK and\nnow I can click on formula and\n\n205\n00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.550\ntell it how to calculate what's\ngoing to go in that field.\n\n206\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:22.300\nI want to take probability and\nimpact and average them together, right.\n\n207\n00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.360\nFind out what that average\nnumber is going to be or\n\n208\n00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.920\nwe could multiply them together or however\nit is that you wanted to factor it.\n\n209\n00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.240\nYou can create a formula.\n\n210\n00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.930\nYou have all of your mathematical\noperators right here and\n\n211\n00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.660\nall of your fields are just\nvariables that you can bring in.\n\n212\n00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.360\nSo, if I want to bring in something\nthat's one of my number fields.\n\n213\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.400\nI can go down here to number and inside\nof numbers, I can go to custom number and\n\n214\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.350\nthere's my probability and\nimpact and I can bring those in.\n\n215\n00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.640\nLet me find the other one here.\n\n216\n00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.710\nGot to navigate down and you'll see,\nI just don't have to use my custom ones.\n\n217\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.920\nI can use other fields, too but if I\nwant to take probability and impact work\n\n218\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.260\nthis out, I want to create a average\nnumber, is really what we want here.\n\n219\n00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.440\nSo, to find the average, what do we do?\n\n220\n00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.970\nWe add the numbers up and\nthen we divide by the number of objects.\n\n221\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.530\nI'm just gonna add a plus\nsign in the middle, right?\n\n222\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.290\nSo, it's probability plus impact and\nI wanna divide that whole thing by two, so\n\n223\n00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.230\nI'm gonna put these guys.\n\n224\n00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.850\nI gotta remember my order of operations.\n\n225\n00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:29.191\nGotta go back to my third grade math here\nand I wanna divide all of that by two.\n\n226\n00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:30.860\nAll right?\n\n227\n00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.210\nProbability impact divided by two\nthat's going to give me the average and\n\n228\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.350\nthere might actually even be an average\nfunction in here there are some\n\n229\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.580\ncertain formulas that are kind\nof a part of this but\n\n230\n00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.651\nI don't remember them guess\nI will do it this way.\n\n231\n00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:47.690\nAll right so, when I say okay to\nthat now it's got a formula and\n\n232\n00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:52.490\ninstead of me typing in a value for risk\nrating, it's gonna calculate it out and\n\n233\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.330\nwhen I say OK to that, I can come in\nhere and I can insert a new column and\n\n234\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.430\nI'm gonna pick that number three,\nright here.\n\n235\n00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.350\nThat's my risk rating and\nsee how it's already got values in there?\n\n236\n00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.830\nIt's figuring them out for me.\n\n237\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.690\nNow, that's just simple math, we\ncould've done the math ourselves, right?\n\n238\n00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.700\nBut the cool part here is\nthat it updates on its own.\n\n239\n00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.800\nIf I take this one where I've got\na probability of one and impact of six?\n\n240\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.740\nThe risk rating is 3.5 maybe\nI bump up my probability and\n\n241\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.820\nsee how it recalculated that for me?\n\n242\n00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.900\nThe nice thing about using\na calculated column is it\n\n243\n00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.970\nupdates in response to other changes that\nyou make and that's really powerful.\n\n244\n00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.880\nSo, a custom field could be data\nthat you put in yourself manual, or\n\n245\n00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.780\nit can be calculated data that's either\nlooked up from other fields in your system\n\n246\n00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.990\nor calculate it as the result of\na formula, and that's super powerful.\n\n247\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.500\n>> It really is a powerful\nway that we can actually see,\n\n248\n00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.910\nby creating these custom fields,\nwe get the result that we want.\n\n249\n00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.540\nNow, the nice thing about something\nlike what Don did is that we\n\n250\n00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.790\ncan also attach it to what we\ncall a graphical indicator, and\n\n251\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.480\nthat means instead of actually looking\nat a number like 6.5 or 4.3 and\n\n252\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.710\ngoing, huh, I wonder if that\nmeans something good or bad?\n\n253\n00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.760\nWe actually have a way that we can\nattach it to something that will kind of\n\n254\n00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.060\nat least give us a graphic indicator of\nhey, things are going well or not so well.\n\n255\n00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.730\n>> Yeah, and that's really important\nif you're trying to figure out for\n\n256\n00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.260\nyour risk assessment, which ones you need\nto pay attention to or, I used risk here.\n\n257\n00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.780\nMaybe you're using schedule, so\nyou're calculating how far behind, or\n\n258\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:24.030\nhow far ahead something is, and you want\nto create a graphical indicator, a little\n\n259\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.020\nred light, yellow light, green light and\nif something has a red light, that's bad.\n\n260\n00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.180\nWe need to worry about that.\n\n261\n00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.330\nIf it's got a green light,\nthat's perfect, great don't do anything.\n\n262\n00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.440\nIf it's got a yellow light,\nwe just need to be aware, right.\n\n263\n00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.440\nSo, for our risk ratings, when we're\ntrying to figure out which risks we want\n\n264\n00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.750\nto handle, we need to say all right we're\ntreating this on a scale of one to ten.\n\n265\n00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.620\nWhen do we need to worry about it?\n\n266\n00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:49.210\nMaybe we feel if something is a six or\nhigher we need to worry about it.\n\n267\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.490\nWe need to have a contingency agreement or\ncome up with some kind of mitigating\n\n268\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:57.430\npolicy or whatever but\nif it's a say a three, four, or\n\n269\n00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.920\nfive we just need to be aware of it and if\nit's a one or a two we can just ignore it.\n\n270\n00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.730\nSo.\n\n271\n00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.120\nWe can create a graphical\nindicator that keys off of that.\n\n272\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.360\nNow I can create a graphical indicator\nas its own separate column and just do\n\n273\n00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.990\na lookup against the risk-rating column or\nI can just modify the risk-rating column.\n\n274\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.410\nIf I don't actually need to know\nthis number, I can modify it and\n\n275\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.040\nsay instead of showing me the number.\n\n276\n00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.770\nShow me a graphic, all right.\n\n277\n00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.810\nSo, I'm gonna take that risk rating,\nI'm gonna modify that.\n\n278\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.230\nSo, I'm gonna go back into my custom\nfields and I'm gonna take Risk Rating.\n\n279\n00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.000\nNow, if I was creating a new one, right?\n\n280\n00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.460\nSo, if I were to take this number here,\nI can come and tell it to do a lookup and\n\n281\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.030\nfor the lookup I could specify the values\nin this table to be able to have possible\n\n282\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.790\nentries, or I could use values from\na table somewhere else and choose it.\n\n283\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:46.110\nYou got a few different options here for\nwhere that data's gonna come from, but\n\n284\n00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.830\nin my case I'm just gonna use this\nguy up here, the risk rating and\n\n285\n00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.320\ntell it, instead of viewing the data,\n\n286\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.590\nI wanna view a graphical indicator and\nwhen you define that graphical indicator,\n\n287\n00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:03.290\nnow you've got to set up rules to\nsay which indicator to show when.\n\n288\n00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.690\nAnd so right here we've got this test for\nrisk rating and\n\n289\n00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.330\nI'm gonna say,\nwhat was it I was saying, Ronnie?\n\n290\n00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.680\nIf it was a one or a two we'd ignore it.\n\n291\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:18.080\nSo, for\nthat I might say if it is less than three,\n\n292\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.350\nshow this image and in my little drop down\nbox I can pick and these are kinda tiny.\n\n293\n00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.990\nThey're tiny on my screen too.\n\n294\n00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.040\nSo, I'm gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna pick my little green square.\n\n295\n00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.360\nAll right so, if it's less than three,\nthat would basically be zero, one or\n\n296\n00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.120\ntwo, then give me a green square.\n\n297\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.930\nIf it's, now I want to say if it's\nbetween three, four, and five, okay.\n\n298\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:44.946\nWell there's not really a good way to\nsay between three, four, and five.\n\n299\n00:15:44.946 --> 00:15:50.703\nSo, what I'm gonna do here is I'm\ngonna say if it's less than six,\n\n300\n00:15:50.703 --> 00:15:52.219\ngive me a yellow.\n\n301\n00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:52.930\nAll right.\n\n302\n00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.582\nNow, you might be thinking to yourself,\nwell,\n\n303\n00:15:55.582 --> 00:15:58.220\nif it's less than six give me a yellow.\n\n304\n00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.030\nHere, if it's less than three,\ngive me a green.\n\n305\n00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.700\nWouldn't two match both of these?\n\n306\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.850\nAnd you'd be right.\n\n307\n00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.490\nWell, these rules are applied\nin order starting from the top.\n\n308\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.560\nSo, if my value is a two,\nit's going to hit this first rule, and\n\n309\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.330\nit's going to turn green.\n\n310\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.270\nAnd then it won't even make\nit to the second rule.\n\n311\n00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:19.190\nIf my value is four,\nit will hit the first rule and say well,\n\n312\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.090\nI'm not less than three.\n\n313\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.920\nAnd then it will go to the second rule and\nsay oh, I'm less than six,\n\n314\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.260\nand it will make it yellow.\n\n315\n00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.740\nSo, the order that we put\nthese in is really important.\n\n316\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.600\nAnd if you choose a rule, you've got these\narrows where you can move it up and down.\n\n317\n00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.150\nTo change the order.\n\n318\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.380\nSo, just be thinking about\nthat as you create them.\n\n319\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.310\nThey're applied in order\nfrom the top down.\n\n320\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.680\nAnd so you'll have to kind of\nrestructure things to match that.\n\n321\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.930\nAnd then lastly I want to say if\nanything is six or higher, make it red.\n\n322\n00:16:45.955 --> 00:16:52.100\nS,o I'll come in here and say greater\nthan or equal to six, Make it red.\n\n323\n00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.070\nAll right.\n\n324\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.840\nAnd I just thought about a little\nproblem I've gotta remember here.\n\n325\n00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.450\nWhen we set these up,\nyou gotta remember things like decimals.\n\n326\n00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.220\nRight?\n\n327\n00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.870\nSo, what if it's some kind of\ndecimal value or something.\n\n328\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.480\nAnd in my case, have I accounted for that?\n\n329\n00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.950\nCuz you might think,\nif I wanna get stuff that is.\n\n330\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.880\nYou know less than six.\n\n331\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.300\nWe might just say,\nwell let me get five and lower.\n\n332\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.540\nRight, that will be less than six.\n\n333\n00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.672\nBut what if something as\nfrustrating as 5.5 right,\n\n334\n00:17:19.672 --> 00:17:21.590\nso we gotta kinda account for that.\n\n335\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.820\nSo, when I say less than six.\n\n336\n00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:24.800\nThat's what I want.\n\n337\n00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.780\nGreater than or equal to six,\nthat's perfect.\n\n338\n00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.810\nLess than three alright.\n\n339\n00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.150\nI'm just making sure I don't\nhave any gaps in my numbers.\n\n340\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.740\nRight, if you ever worried about that,\nif you have gaps in your numbers a neat\n\n341\n00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.260\nlittle trick that you can do is for\nyour last line you can come in here and\n\n342\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:43.370\nyou can say something like if it's any\nvalue make it black or some other color so\n\n343\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.570\nyou can spot it, I'll make it white so if\nI see anything that has a white indicator\n\n344\n00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.590\nI know that it didn't match my\nother stuff for some reason, right?\n\n345\n00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.380\nI'm guessing some kind of bad calculation,\nI need to fix it.\n\n346\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.650\nMaybe I have negative value, or\nI have a value that is over 10 and\n\n347\n00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.080\nif I'm doing a 1 to 10 scale.\n\n348\n00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.210\nCan never have anything over 10,\n\n349\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:04.070\nso you can create some little\ncatch all rules like these right.\n\n350\n00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.440\nIf it's greater than or\nless than or equal to.\n\n351\n00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.030\nWell, actually I want to\nsay greater than 10 And\n\n352\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.970\nthat means someone put in a value\nthey shouldn't have put in right?\n\n353\n00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.400\nAnd I might move that right\nup here to the top, or\n\n354\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.750\nif it's less than one, if I'm ranking\nthings on a scale of one to ten I should\n\n355\n00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.450\nnever have anything that's less than one.\n\n356\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.670\nAnd so I might wanna make that\none show up as white also.\n\n357\n00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.740\nAgain just another quick indicator.\n\n358\n00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.840\nAnd I'm gonna move those two up to\nthe very top, so it checks those first.\n\n359\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.180\nIf it's outside of the range that\nit should be, that's a problem.\n\n360\n00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.260\nI'll make it white.\n\n361\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.390\nEverything else is gonna be either green,\nyellow, or red.\n\n362\n00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.260\nAll right, I'll go ahead and\nsay okay to that.\n\n363\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.880\nAnd that's going to apply to this field.\n\n364\n00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.760\nAnd when I say OK here,\nthere go my risk ratings changing.\n\n365\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.790\nRight?\n\n366\n00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.250\nIf something has a six or higher,\nit's gonna get a red light.\n\n367\n00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.460\nI need to plan for that.\n\n368\n00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.260\nIf it's, what was it?\n\n369\n00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.930\nA three, four, or five, we'd get yellow,\nand if it was a one or two we'd get green.\n\n370\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.550\nSo, as I look down this list\nthis guy right here is red.\n\n371\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.320\nWell I've got a nine and\n\n372\n00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.660\na three that's gonna average out to six,\nthat's in the red range.\n\n373\n00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.650\nAnd here I've got a two and a six,\nthat's gonna average out to four,\n\n374\n00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:13.960\nthat's in my yellow range.\n\n375\n00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.280\nAnd is nobody green?\n\n376\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.750\nI don't have any greens.\n\n377\n00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.900\nLet's take somebody and\nmanipulate it to make it green.\n\n378\n00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.810\nSo, if I take this guy, well, there.\n\n379\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.010\nSo I manipulate it there it turned green.\n\n380\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.650\nThere beneath that threshold.\n\n381\n00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.880\nSo, I'm not worried about them.\n\n382\n00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.510\nThey're averaging out to 2.5.\n\n383\n00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.990\nAnd so, I ignore that.\n\n384\n00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.050\nI can agree, right?\n\n385\n00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.590\nThis little graphical indicator,\nI can spot that.\n\n386\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.730\nAnd if somebody slips up and\nputs a bad value in there,\n\n387\n00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.310\nlike I want to put in two\nas my probability, and\n\n388\n00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:44.480\nI put in 22 by accident, now my risk\nrating is outside the normal range.\n\n389\n00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.190\nAnd I get that white block in there.\n\n390\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.530\nThe white block lets me know\nDon't trust that value.\n\n391\n00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:49.470\nThere's something wrong.\n\n392\n00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.600\nIt's outside of the range\nthat it should have been.\n\n393\n00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.910\nAnd I can spot that double entry and\ngo in and fix it.\n\n394\n00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:55.500\nAll right?\n\n395\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.300\nSo, you can have some real fun with this.\n\n396\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.790\nProject has a ton of data and\na ton of fields, but\n\n397\n00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.230\nwe can customize it to meet our own needs\nif there's something we have that's\n\n398\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.620\nspecific that just doesn't\nmatch what's already in there.\n\n399\n00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.680\nAnd the key to using the graphical\nindicators, cuz once you start\n\n400\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.610\ndoing it, all of a sudden you'll end up\ncreating this project and go, you know I'd\n\n401\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.040\nrather actually see all these, but then\nit can become very busy and so usually\n\n402\n00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.820\nthe recommendation is you don't do more\nthan two or three if you're gonna do that.\n\n403\n00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.150\nNow, don't get me wrong, you can\nactually come up with your own table and\n\n404\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.670\nhave 10 to 15 to 20 of them, but at that\npoint you're now having to guess about\n\n405\n00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.520\nwhat all these different things mean.\n\n406\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.620\nBut overall though,\n\n407\n00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.000\nit is a very powerful tool that gives\nyou the ability to glance and go,\n\n408\n00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.870\nyes I need to pay attention to that, or\nyeah I don't have to worry about that one.\n\n409\n00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.160\nAnd so\nthese indicators are really the power and\n\n410\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.400\nuse of what we can up with those formulas\nto make us To be able to have a very easy,\n\n411\n00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.120\nquick decision making that we do.\n\n412\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.920\n>> Yeah.\nAnother thing to think of is,\n\n413\n00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.210\nwhen you create these custom fields\nyou're not actually creating a field,\n\n414\n00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.800\nit already exists, right?\n\n415\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.220\nSo, it doesn't really impact your database\nperformance-wise there just creating it.\n\n416\n00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.460\nBut when you do a calculation, right?\n\n417\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.640\nAny of the formula based stuff that's\nan operation that has to happen in\n\n418\n00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.190\nthe background and every time you open\nyour project it's going to recalculate\n\n419\n00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.730\nthat column, and anytime you make changes\nit's going to recalculate that column and\n\n420\n00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:15.470\nif this is a massive project\nThe more complex your formulas get\n\n421\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.020\nthe longer it takes Project to open.\n\n422\n00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.680\nBasically it can slow things down a little\nbit there so you don't wanna go too crazy.\n\n423\n00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.700\nBut on modern computers\nthis is a simple average.\n\n424\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.680\nI mean this happens so\nfast that it's really negligible.\n\n425\n00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.850\nBut just be aware that you can go a little\n\n426\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:30.590\ncrazy with it-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.540\n>> And end up with some complex stuff.\n\n428\n00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.980\nBut it is a fun one to mess around with.\n\n429\n00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.730\nThere's a lot of neat\nthings you can do in there.\n\n430\n00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:42.060\nThe lookups are another neat option\nbecause the way this is right here,\n\n431\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.320\nI've got it where when I punch in a value.\n\n432\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.010\nYou know what, let's take a look at it.\n\n433\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.940\nI wasn't gonna talk about it, we'll\ntalk about it anyway, we've got time.\n\n434\n00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.480\nThese are just open fields so\nI can come in here and\n\n435\n00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.620\ntype whatever I wanted for probability.\n\n436\n00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.480\nSo, I can make that a five or a ten or\n20 or 30, whatever it is that I wanted it\n\n437\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.320\nto be even though I said I want\nit to be on a scale one to ten.\n\n438\n00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:03.940\nRight.\n\n439\n00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.920\nSo, if I want to force it where its\nalways on a scale of one to ten,\n\n440\n00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.300\nI could create a drop-down\nbox here instead.\n\n441\n00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.670\nInstead of having like this where\nyou can type in whatever you want,\n\n442\n00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.290\nwhere it's a drop-down box,\nwe can do that with a lookup function.\n\n443\n00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:18.990\nRight, so, if I go in here,\ninto my custom fields again,\n\n444\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.790\nand I'm gonna take my probability, right.\n\n445\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.550\nAnd what my probability.\n\n446\n00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.570\nDown here,\nwe've got custom attributes, and\n\n447\n00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:30.960\nit's set to none right now, which means\nyou can type in whatever you want, right?\n\n448\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.020\nBut if we change that to look up,\n\n449\n00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.890\nnow we can create a look\nup list of possible values.\n\n450\n00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.960\nAnd the cool part about doing\nit here is I can come in and\n\n451\n00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.160\nI can start to put in these custom values,\nand\n\n452\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.000\nthese are going to be the limits for\nwhat people can choose.\n\n453\n00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.900\nAnd you can even give them descriptions\nlike, you know, this is the lowest or\n\n454\n00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:58.880\nmaybe I'll just call this like,\nunlikely and\n\n455\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:05.030\nthen maybe I'll call this one likely,\nand then Very likely.\n\n456\n00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.390\nJust so people can understand.\n\n457\n00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.270\nSome people might say well,\nis ten that it's really gonna happen or\n\n458\n00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.700\nis one that it's really gonna happen.\n\n459\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.370\nI don't know.\n\n460\n00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.680\nSo, I'm just kind of setting\nsome basic descriptions here.\n\n461\n00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.560\nSo, now it's got this value\nset of one through ten, right?\n\n462\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.480\nAnd you could actually pull that\nfrom another table if we wanted but\n\n463\n00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.050\nit my case, this is what we want.\n\n464\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.950\nAnd then We'll come down here and\n\n465\n00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.590\nit's got this little option\nwe need to pay attention to.\n\n466\n00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.940\nAllow addition items to be entered\ninto the fields, all right?\n\n467\n00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.010\nIf that's checked, people can still\ntype whatever they wanted but\n\n468\n00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.900\nif it's unchecked they're going to have\nto pick from this list right here.\n\n469\n00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.040\nIf I turn this option on and\nsomebody adds a new value like 11,\n\n470\n00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.270\nit's actually going to add it here.\n\n471\n00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.190\nAnd it's gonna add 11, and now other\npeople will see that in the dropdown box.\n\n472\n00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.210\nWe normally leave that off.\n\n473\n00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:50.940\nI'm gonna leave mine off too.\n\n474\n00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.940\nAll right, and\nI'll go ahead and close there.\n\n475\n00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.820\nSo, now I've got that list for\nprobability.\n\n476\n00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.350\nNow I could've copied that over for\nimpact, but\n\n477\n00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:58.915\nimpact is a little bit The different.\n\n478\n00:23:58.915 --> 00:23:59.505\nRight?\n\n479\n00:23:59.505 --> 00:24:03.295\nImpact isnt about whether\nsomethings likely or unlikely.\n\n480\n00:24:03.295 --> 00:24:08.455\nIf I go into Impact and I change to a look\nup, now I can go give it its values.\n\n481\n00:24:08.455 --> 00:24:11.605\nAnd sure they might be one through 10,\njust like the other one.\n\n482\n00:24:11.605 --> 00:24:17.390\nBut now these are going to\nbe low impact Or, you know,\n\n483\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:23.815\nnot much cost or risk or whatever,\nwe might have a moderate impact,\n\n484\n00:24:23.815 --> 00:24:28.010\nand then we might have a severe, or\nyou know we kind of know that it's impact,\n\n485\n00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:32.140\nwe might just call it moderate low and\nsevere.\n\n486\n00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:37.220\nAll right, so now people know that\na one is low, and a ten is severe.\n\n487\n00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.770\nI'll go in and set that.\n\n488\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.230\nNow once that's done,\n\n489\n00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:45.070\nwhen I start coming to these fields\nsee how I've got a drop down now?\n\n490\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.190\nAnd I can drop that down and I can pick.\n\n491\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.270\nAnd right here I can see that.\n\n492\n00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:53.630\nUnlikely, likely, very likely or\nI can see low, moderate, severe.\n\n493\n00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.890\nNow people have a good\nunderstanding of that.\n\n494\n00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:00.210\nAnd if I come in and try to punch\nsomething else in I get an error.\n\n495\n00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.900\nThis is not a valid lookup table value.\n\n496\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.990\nAnd now it's forcing me\nto use these values.\n\n497\n00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:09.250\nI could go and remove those little white\nbox checks that I put in on the graphical\n\n498\n00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.695\nside, because those should\nbe impossible at that point.\n\n499\n00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:12.285\nRight?\n\n500\n00:25:12.285 --> 00:25:15.550\nBut now we can go through and\nstart to pick these values and\n\n501\n00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.765\n[INAUDIBLE] straight ten here,\nsuper severe.\n\n502\n00:25:19.765 --> 00:25:22.185\nRight?\nSo, really powerful functionality there,\n\n503\n00:25:22.185 --> 00:25:24.405\ncuz now we control the data\nthat's going into our database.\n\n504\n00:25:26.835 --> 00:25:28.035\nAll right.\nWell, Ronnie,\n\n505\n00:25:28.035 --> 00:25:28.865\nI think we've\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n506\n00:25:28.865 --> 00:25:30.245\n>> given several different examples of how\n\n507\n00:25:30.245 --> 00:25:31.535\nto use the custom fields.\n\n508\n00:25:31.535 --> 00:25:34.335\nWe saw just creating a custom\nfield with simple text.\n\n509\n00:25:34.335 --> 00:25:36.310\nRight?\nThat's one of the easiest examples.\n\n510\n00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.560\nWe saw using formulas to calculate data.\n\n511\n00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:44.070\nWe saw using graphical interpreters to\nwell kinda see stuff at a glance and\n\n512\n00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.240\nthen lastly,\nwe talked about look up tables.\n\n513\n00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.720\nIt's really powerful stuff,\ndefinitely something to take advantage of.\n\n514\n00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.170\nCan you think of anything we missed?\n\n515\n00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.940\n>> No, we went with the custom fields,\nright?\n\n516\n00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.720\nIf you know more about project management\nyou'll see some of the existing\n\n517\n00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.200\nfields that are there and then be able\nto use some of the formulas from project\n\n518\n00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.110\nmanagement that show you exactly\nwhat you really wanted to show.\n\n519\n00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.630\nAnd that is the power of\nusing these custom fields,\n\n520\n00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.490\nis to give you the information\nthat you need so\n\n521\n00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.620\nyou can make your best business\ndecision for your project.\n\n522\n00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.840\nSo, it's by far one of the most powerful\nthings we can do here on All right,\n\n523\n00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.000\nwell ladies and gentlemen,\nI hoped you guys enjoyed it.\n\n524\n00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.620\nIt's one of the more fun things where you\ntake project and make it work for you so,\n\n525\n00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.330\nI always enjoy it.\n\n526\n00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.000\nBut that's it for our show today.\n\n527\n00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.210\nSo, signing of for\nITPro TV I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n528\n00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.470\n>> I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n529\n00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:28.249\n>>

00:00:16.131\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:19.890\nI'm your host Don Purset back\nagain with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.600\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.750\n>> It is going great today.\n\n7\n00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.550\nFeeling good and ready to get started and\ntake a look at some new technology for us.\n\n8\n00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.150\n>> And that new technology is\ngoing to be Microsoft project.\n\n9\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.200\nWe've already filmed a couple of\nepisodes covering how to use Microsoft,\n\n10\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.060\ncreating that first project.\n\n11\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.720\nBut what we wanna look at in this episode\nare some of the custom settings and\n\n12\n00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.260\noptions that we can change that kinda\nmodifies the default behavior of project.\n\n13\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.760\nWhen you fire up project,\nit is really designed for\n\n14\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.910\nyou to hit the ground running and\nstart managing your project right away.\n\n15\n00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.910\nBut you'll find there's some things\nthat we can tweak that actually\n\n16\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.070\nimprove the way that it works.\n\n17\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.650\nIt can make it suit our needs\na little bit better, and\n\n18\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.090\nthat's what we're gonna explore today.\n\n19\n00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.410\nSo Ronnie, where do we start?\n\n20\n00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.300\n>> Well, when we start taking\na look at project, right,\n\n21\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.050\nbecause of the way it is set up.\n\n22\n00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.850\nSo that we can go ahead and\njust get started right away.\n\n23\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.590\nYou start working with it and\nyou go okay, everything's fine.\n\n24\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.450\nBut then you start seeing those unusual\nthings, like why does it keep defaulting\n\n25\n00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.940\nto this fixed unit type when I actually\nwant it to do something different.\n\n26\n00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.780\nEvery time you actually set it up,\n\n27\n00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.650\nall of a sudden here it is\n80 different tasks later.\n\n28\n00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.310\nYou're like I can't believe I have to\ngo back and change all this stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.610\nWhy can't I just have the tools\nthat I want available\n\n30\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.760\nto me right there on the screen?\n\n31\n00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.810\nWhy do I have to keep\nswitching between these views?\n\n32\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.690\nThere are so\nmany different things that we can do.\n\n33\n00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.230\nAnd that's what we wanna\nactually demonstrate today.\n\n34\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.850\nIn some of the ways that you can\nchange some of the default options\n\n35\n00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.430\nright from the beginning.\n\n36\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.650\nSo the way that we do that\nis there are of course,\n\n37\n00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.125\na couple of different ones that\nwe want to start off with.\n\n38\n00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:44.275\nSo let's go ahead and show you.\n\n39\n00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:46.985\nSo on my computer I went ahead and\n\n40\n00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:51.755\nI just pulled up just a project list that\nI've started from a previous episode.\n\n41\n00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:55.375\nWe just imported this list in there's\nnothing else actually associated it with,\n\n42\n00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:58.215\nbut I know that by default the way\nthat project works is that\n\n43\n00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:00.650\nit's gonna default to just\nthese certain settings.\n\n44\n00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.700\nAnd what if I needed to customize that and\nchange that.\n\n45\n00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.890\nWell, easiest way to do that is to go to\nfile, and once I'm actually inside file.\n\n46\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.590\nNotice that I have the option\nthat is down here that says,\n\n47\n00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.360\noption of course, I did that double there.\n\n48\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.620\nGo ahead and click options, and\n\n49\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.470\nit is right here that we actually\nget into the project options itself.\n\n50\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.500\nAnd at the beginning,\n\n51\n00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.320\nyou can actually see some of the things\nthat you may choose to change.\n\n52\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.550\nAnd you may choose to change this\nbased on your location on the planet,\n\n53\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.820\nwhere you're actually working as\na project manager if you're doing this.\n\n54\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.270\nBut they do actually give\nyou some nice information.\n\n55\n00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.310\nSo here notice that the default view.\n\n56\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.930\nSo when you actually\nfirst bring up a project.\n\n57\n00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.650\nAnd you'll go, I don't really like\nthis view, I want it to change.\n\n58\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.720\nNotice you can change that to any of\nthe other views that are actually\n\n59\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.810\navailable for you.\n\n60\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.950\nIf you wanna start off with\na calendar right away or even the,\n\n61\n00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.080\nwhat do I wanna call it, the task flow,\nI can't remember what I call it there.\n\n62\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.840\nThe one that actually works as a-\n>> Oh, the network diagram?\n\n63\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.610\n>> Network diagram,\n\n64\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.816\nyeah, the network diagram, you can\nactually do stuff like that instead.\n\n65\n00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:02.340\nSo a lot of people like doing that, and\n\n66\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.630\nyou go all right, this is what I feel\nmore comfortable in and you can do that.\n\n67\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.580\nAnd then, of course, the date format\nbecause, once again, wherever you are you\n\n68\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.410\nmight find that the date settings\nare actually different from where you are.\n\n69\n00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.380\nAnd, of course, you can change that so it\nshows up in your project plan the way that\n\n70\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.060\nyou expect it show up and\nnot anybody else.\n\n71\n00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.890\nSo, it's right here that you can change\nsome of those very simple things\n\n72\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.650\nthat might annoy you\nright at the beginning.\n\n73\n00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.780\nBut some of the other ones that are also\nhere, specifically dealing with\n\n74\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.390\nthe project plan itself, is right here\nunder schedule and under display.\n\n75\n00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.850\nOf course, I kinda skipped\nover that I didn't mean to.\n\n76\n00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.190\nBut right there under display,\neven when my reader's on.\n\n77\n00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.310\nThis is the one that\ngets me right here Don,\n\n78\n00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.380\nis that I don't consider it\nbecause I'm here in the West.\n\n79\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.440\nI'm here in the United States and\n\n80\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.480\nI know that this is the default\ncalendar that I would set up.\n\n81\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.650\nBut if I were in different parts of the\nworld, I might choose instead to choose\n\n82\n00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.550\none of these other calendars that\nare also set up, for us to be able\n\n83\n00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.420\nto honor certain holidays in that culture,\nand that custom for us to do that as well.\n\n84\n00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.860\nAnd that way, we insure that we can\nschedule around certain events that\n\n85\n00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.000\nthey may take into consideration,\nso it's always good.\n\n86\n00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.850\nAnd of course, even for\nyour currency options,\n\n87\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.130\nto go and change all these options\nover here, you can do that as well.\n\n88\n00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.070\nSo, here in the states, of course,\nwe use the USD symbol, but\n\n89\n00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.530\nthe euro is still out there,\nand there's a few others, too.\n\n90\n00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.180\n>> Yeah, a big thing to remember about\nMicrosoft Projects is, this is software\n\n91\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.130\nnormally when Microsoft creates software,\nthey create it to sell it.\n\n92\n00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.750\nSo they say, we're gonna make Microsoft\nWord, the best word processor ever.\n\n93\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.310\nAnd we're gonna sell it out so\nother people can use it.\n\n94\n00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.570\nWith Microsoft project\nthat's not how it started.\n\n95\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.150\nIt started because Microsoft said, we need\na way to manage our own projects, and so\n\n96\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.890\nthey kind of created this software and\nevolved it.\n\n97\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.190\nAnd then it got to a point when they said,\nman this works really well for\n\n98\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.950\nus, we should sell it to other people.\n\n99\n00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.300\nAnd then it got kinda open, but remember\nMicrosoft is a multi national company.\n\n100\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.440\nThey've got offices all over the world and\nso working with different calendars,\n\n101\n00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.690\nworking with different languages and\n\n102\n00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.480\ncurrencies, that's\nsomething they deal with.\n\n103\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.070\nIt's built right there into\nthe software and it's really handy.\n\n104\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.990\n>> It sure is and it adjust again\nto your location and your setting.\n\n105\n00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.430\nBut most of us, even though those\ntwo are really kind of good,\n\n106\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.620\ngeneric information that we wanna be\nable to modify is here in the schedule.\n\n107\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.690\nThat we normally are really trying\nto tweak it to our projects and\n\n108\n00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.260\nwhat we're going to be doing.\n\n109\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.480\nSo it's right here that you wanna pay most\nof your attention, because this is where\n\n110\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.610\nit actually affects every single project\nand everything that you're working on.\n\n111\n00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.500\nNotice that you can change the start date\nof the week, as well as changing it to\n\n112\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.950\nyour fiscal year, instead of the actual\nregular calendar that you're using.\n\n113\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.610\nAnd then if your default times for your\nbusiness are in a different, so notice you\n\n114\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.220\ncan change everything about the way that\nproject will be recognized by default.\n\n115\n00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.020\nStart hours, hours per day,\nper month, whatever you want to do.\n\n116\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.770\nAll of these are usually\nthe options we're taking a look at.\n\n117\n00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.630\nNow the one that we really wanna\nfocus in on is the one that I\n\n118\n00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.590\nkinda mentioned right at the beginning.\n\n119\n00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.740\nIs that by default,\nwhen you actually select it or\n\n120\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.530\nwhen you create a task, it's gonna\nbe what we call a fixed unit task.\n\n121\n00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.270\nAnd that's actually just kind\nof one of the ways that have and\n\n122\n00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.220\nthere's usually three default ways.\n\n123\n00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.110\nFixed units, fixed work,\nand fixed duration.\n\n124\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.570\nSo, if you actually do know the way your\ntask are generally gonna be calculated for\n\n125\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.710\nits duration or its work or\nits units here.\n\n126\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.400\nYou may choose to actually change those,\nand\n\n127\n00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.215\nthat's where you actually\ndo it right here.\n\n128\n00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.795\nSo that every time you put a regular task,\n\n129\n00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:26.275\nit's gonna default to which\none you choose right here.\n\n130\n00:06:26.275 --> 00:06:28.995\n>> Yeah and obviously you can\noverride that on a particular task.\n\n131\n00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:32.405\nBut I've got one task that's fixed unit\nand everything else is fixed work.\n\n132\n00:06:32.405 --> 00:06:35.015\nI wanna set fixed work to the default\ncuz they always come up that way.\n\n133\n00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:37.775\nAnd then I can change the ones\nthat I need to fixed unit.\n\n134\n00:06:37.775 --> 00:06:40.125\nThere's one more thing that I wanna\npoint out on this screen Ronnie, and\n\n135\n00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:42.550\nyou'll see this in\nthe other option screens.\n\n136\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.130\nSee how the options\nare divided up into sections?\n\n137\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.610\nAnd you've got the schedule section.\n\n138\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.580\nAnd then you've got schedule\nalert options, and so on.\n\n139\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.250\nSee how some of those dividers\nhave a drop-down box beside them?\n\n140\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.600\nAll right, that's letting you know that\nthese are options for this one project.\n\n141\n00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.830\nIf you have five project files,\n\n142\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.880\nall five of them could have different\noptions right there for those settings.\n\n143\n00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.820\nIt's for each of those individually.\n\n144\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.110\nBut there's some sections that\ndon't have a drop-down box,\n\n145\n00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.770\nlike that schedule section up\nthere has no drop-down box.\n\n146\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.220\nThat's being set for your install\nof Microsoft project, all right.\n\n147\n00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.450\nNow I wanted to point that out\nbecause if you're setting the options\n\n148\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.460\non a project file, it doesn't matter\nwhat computer you log in from.\n\n149\n00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.460\nIt doesn't matter what\nuser you're logged in as.\n\n150\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.960\nWhen you open the project,\nthose settings are in the project file.\n\n151\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.740\nAnd they're preserved, but the settings\nthat are in sections that don't have\n\n152\n00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.860\na drop down box, that's set for\nyour install a project.\n\n153\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.460\nSo, if you log in as a different\nuser they get reset.\n\n154\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.770\nIf you log in from a different\ncomputer they get reset, so\n\n155\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.470\nthose don't follow the project.\n\n156\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.750\nSo just be aware of that little\ndifference when you go through, and\n\n157\n00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.830\nsee it if you're wondering why those\ndrop down boxes are there that's why.\n\n158\n00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.514\nBecause those are settings that\nare actually being stored in the project\n\n159\n00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.048\nfile itself.\n\n160\n00:07:53.048 --> 00:07:56.704\n>> It's kinda amazing how much detail and\ncontrol you do have to be able\n\n161\n00:07:56.704 --> 00:07:59.732\nto either do that one project or\nyou actually select it.\n\n162\n00:07:59.732 --> 00:08:01.549\nSo like for example, mine has.\n\n163\n00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:04.454\nAll projects,\nif I want to affect it that way too.\n\n164\n00:08:04.454 --> 00:08:07.577\nAnd then here is something that's\nalso kind of neat as well,\n\n165\n00:08:07.577 --> 00:08:11.436\nthe new tasks created they're either\ngonna be called what we call manually\n\n166\n00:08:11.436 --> 00:08:13.650\nscheduled or auto scheduled too.\n\n167\n00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.820\nThe manually scheduled\ngives you more control, but\n\n168\n00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.850\nit also means you have to put in more\ninformation right at the beginning.\n\n169\n00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.420\nWhere as the auto schedule, it can go\nin and start filling in stuff for you.\n\n170\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.160\nIt's kind of a neat option.\n\n171\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.140\nIt just depends on which one\nyou want to set right away.\n\n172\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.579\nI don't remember changing it so\nit manually schedules here.\n\n173\n00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:29.967\n>> It's funny you say it's a neat option.\n\n174\n00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:32.876\n>> Yeah.\n>> This is one of those that's really\n\n175\n00:08:32.876 --> 00:08:34.480\na divisive option.\n\n176\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.180\n>> Right.\n\n177\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.060\n>> Some people love it.\n\n178\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.250\nSome people hate it.\n\n179\n00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.630\nI'm not the biggest fan of it.\n\n180\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.170\nManually scheduled,\nif I put a task in to start on Monday.\n\n181\n00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.800\nIt's always gonna start on Monday.\n\n182\n00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.380\nIt's manually scheduled\nto start on Monday.\n\n183\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.750\nBut if I schedule it to Monday and\nI set it to auto schedule, and\n\n184\n00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.170\nI put some new tasks before it\nthat's gonna take a little long,\n\n185\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.730\nit will automatically move this task.\n\n186\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.640\nIt will auto schedule it forward\nto move it on the layout.\n\n187\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.390\nNow, that might be fine if it's\nall internal employees, but\n\n188\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.140\nif I've arranged contractors\nto be here on Monday, and\n\n189\n00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:09.010\nMicrosoft Project just moves that\nitem forward a few days on me.\n\n190\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.267\nI don't necessarily know that happened.\n\n191\n00:09:10.267 --> 00:09:11.742\nI've gotta keep an eye on it, and\n\n192\n00:09:11.742 --> 00:09:14.855\nso auto-scheduling can create some\nproblems, and if you know that,\n\n193\n00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:18.810\nif you're aware of that, then you can\nuse it and it'll save you a lot of time.\n\n194\n00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.640\nBut if your not aware of it,\nit can cause problems.\n\n195\n00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.890\nAnd so that's why Microsoft\nturns it off by default.\n\n196\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.560\nThat's set to manually schedule.\n\n197\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.230\nAnd that's one that you can change\nright here in the options screen.\n\n198\n00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.450\nBut, most of these options are actually\nrepresented in the regular UI too.\n\n199\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.040\nSo like Ronnie if he, yeah there.\n\n200\n00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.430\nSo, when he's just on\nhis regular Gantt Chart,\n\n201\n00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:41.720\nsee down on the bottom of the screen where\nit says New tasks manually scheduled.\n\n202\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.520\nIt's letting you know right there, if he's\ngonna create a new task it's gonna be\n\n203\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.320\nmanually scheduled and\nthat's gonna be how all these are created.\n\n204\n00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.210\nIf he changes it in the default\noptions then that would say,\n\n205\n00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.220\nnew task will be auto scheduled.\n\n206\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.630\nOr you can just click on that and\n\n207\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.740\nyou can quickly choose between\nthe two to change that option.\n\n208\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.970\nSo, another way to customize that.\n\n209\n00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.250\nSome of the options are only\navailable in the options panel.\n\n210\n00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.610\nBut, others are represented\nright in the regular UI.\n\n211\n00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.487\nJust like this.\n\n212\n00:10:06.487 --> 00:10:10.228\n>> So, there are a lot of different\noptions that we have available, and\n\n213\n00:10:10.228 --> 00:10:14.744\nif your projects are actually going to be,\nlet's say by default, less than a day or\n\n214\n00:10:14.744 --> 00:10:17.830\nmaybe they actually occur\nin smaller increments.\n\n215\n00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.270\nNotice that the actual increments can\ngo down to minutes, hours, weeks,\n\n216\n00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.330\nmonths, you name it.\n\n217\n00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.230\nSo, you have very large\nschedules that span over years.\n\n218\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.666\nYou can do that as well and then even\nones that actually happen within the day.\n\n219\n00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:33.050\nI remember actually using, Project\nactually dealing as a contractor with\n\n220\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.490\na company that was local here\nthat actually tested drill bits.\n\n221\n00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.060\nAnd they were wondering, could they\nactually use Project to test the duration,\n\n222\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.728\nhow long that drill bit would last under\npressure, and I said, of course you can.\n\n223\n00:10:43.728 --> 00:10:45.960\nAnd now that,\nthe only sign that we see is days,\n\n224\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.630\nit doesn't look like you can\nactually change anything.\n\n225\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.860\nAnd so every time they started a brand new\nproject, that's what they'd have to do,\n\n226\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.690\nthey'd have to go in and\n\n227\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.390\nmanually change everything down to\nminutes, the way that they wanted too.\n\n228\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.540\nBut, after while they were like,\ncan we do this?\n\n229\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.780\nAnd sure enough they were actually able to\nhappily see that they could change it to\n\n230\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.240\nminutes and hours and by default.\n\n231\n00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.170\nAnd that actually did save\nthem a little bit of time too.\n\n232\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.050\nSo, you do have durations and\nof course your work hours, you name it.\n\n233\n00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.840\nBut usually the defaults are normally\nwhat I kinda start off with.\n\n234\n00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.700\nBecause that's usually the types\nof projects that I end up having.\n\n235\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.580\nNow, these check boxes here Don these\nare also kinda important as well\n\n236\n00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.490\nwhen you have it because it again gives\nus default settings such as new tasks or\n\n237\n00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.000\neffort driven.\n\n238\n00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.430\nAnd we talk about the idea\nof effort driven,\n\n239\n00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.730\nwe're gonna take a look at this in another\nepisode a little bit more in detail.\n\n240\n00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:31.820\nRemember what this actually means.\n\n241\n00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.610\nIt means that the duration of\nthat task is gonna shorten\n\n242\n00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.250\nif you actually assign more\nresources to it as well.\n\n243\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.220\nAnd so here it actually says hey,\nnew task, or mine,\n\n244\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.760\nI think default is,\nthey're not effort driven for right now.\n\n245\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.780\nAnd you also see some other ones that\nyou see right here that are also\n\n246\n00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.090\nchecked as well.\n\n247\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.380\n>> Now Microsoft tried to choose\nthe options that were most common.\n\n248\n00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.050\nAnd the ones that were most likely\ncause you the least trouble, right?\n\n249\n00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.650\nSo, that's how a lot of this stuff\nis set up in a safety net type form.\n\n250\n00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.730\nYou can customize this to take\nadvantage of it though and\n\n251\n00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.680\njust as a quick example on effort driven,\nright?\n\n252\n00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.780\nIf I create a task\nthat's is four hours and\n\n253\n00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.760\nI assign Ronnie to it,\nit's a four hour task.\n\n254\n00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.330\nIf I assign me to it.\n\n255\n00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.400\nAnd Ronnie it's still a four hour task.\n\n256\n00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.670\nBut, there is two of us so\n\n257\n00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.020\nshouldn't we be able to get the job\ndone faster since there's two of us?\n\n258\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.020\nWell, if it were an effort driven task yes\nthat would be true it's shortened down and\n\n259\n00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.400\nso we might want that.\n\n260\n00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.540\nBut, there are some things that no matter\nhow many people you assign it is not gonna\n\n261\n00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.260\nget any shorter.\n\n262\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.850\nLike a flight if the flight is eight\nhours, it doesn't matter if Ronnie's on\n\n263\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.810\nthe flight by himself if\nwe're both on the flight.\n\n264\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.210\nIt's still going to be an eight hour\nflight so it doesn't make a difference.\n\n265\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.104\nSo, you need to look at all of your\nactivities that you're planning on\n\n266\n00:12:39.104 --> 00:12:40.050\nputting in.\n\n267\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.130\nAnd determine which is the most common.\n\n268\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.960\nIf effort driven is the most common,\nturn this option on.\n\n269\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.850\nThat way default's effort driven.\n\n270\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.080\nBut if effort driven is an exception,\nright?\n\n271\n00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.130\nIt's not very common,\nleave it at the defaults here and\n\n272\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.670\njust manually set those tasks.\n\n273\n00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.000\nAll of this can be overwritten on\nthe particular task or within the project.\n\n274\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.740\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of neat\nfeatures and as we go on down,\n\n275\n00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.080\nthis is some of the ones that start\nto get a little bit more confusing.\n\n276\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.940\nSo, if I scroll down a little bit\nmore after these check boxes and\n\n277\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.500\nthose schedule alert options.\n\n278\n00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.280\nDown here where it begins\nwith the calculations and\n\n279\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.830\nactually gives us this option here, Don.\n\n280\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.550\nIt says calculate project after each edit.\n\n281\n00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.340\nDo you want it on or off?\n\n282\n00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.730\nWell, Don, I don't know the reason why I\nwouldn't calculate it after each edit.\n\n283\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:21.880\nIs there a reason I shouldn't?\n\n284\n00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.875\n>> So, if you have a massive project,\n\n285\n00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:29.160\nright if you're doing a ten year project\nand you've got thousands of activities.\n\n286\n00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.900\nEvery time you make a change it's\ngotta recalculate the whole timeline.\n\n287\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.740\nNow, if you're doing manual\nscheduling it's not a big deal but\n\n288\n00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.850\nif you're doing auto scheduling,\nit can actually freeze up project for\n\n289\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.340\na minute while it does that recalculation.\n\n290\n00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.170\nNow, it's gotta be a massive project.\n\n291\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.830\nWe're not talking about\na couple hundred tasks,\n\n292\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.030\nwe're talking about tens\nof thousands of tasks.\n\n293\n00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:50.500\nSo, we can turn that option off and now\nit will only reschedule when we save or\n\n294\n00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.160\nwhen we manually tell it to\nrun through and do a refresh.\n\n295\n00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.580\nThe earliest versions of project,\nactually this way by default.\n\n296\n00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.410\nSo, it's more like a backwards\ncompatibility thing.\n\n297\n00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.010\nNow, that's the way you're used to it.\n\n298\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.790\nBut, unless your project is massive,\nyou want it to recalculate right away, and\n\n299\n00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.300\nthat's the default.\n\n300\n00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.120\n>> So, it really does show you some\nof those different options that\n\n301\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.350\nare also available.\n\n302\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.060\nNow, the rest these are actually options\nthat you'll also end up seeing are pretty\n\n303\n00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.870\nmuch under any Microsoft Office product\nthat you see here, things like proofing,\n\n304\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.220\nof course, and then the way that\nyou choose to save the file.\n\n305\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.080\nAnd this may be very important for you\nif you're gonna be storing this file in\n\n306\n00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.330\na remote location instead of actually\nsaving it in your default location.\n\n307\n00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.790\nSo mine, for example,\nsaves my documents folder here.\n\n308\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.660\nIf I were saving it to a network share,\nI may chose instead to browse and\n\n309\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.330\nsave it to that location as well.\n\n310\n00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.060\nAnd then of course, the file type\nI kind of skipped around here.\n\n311\n00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.092\nIt just the my brain way is working here.\n\n312\n00:14:47.092 --> 00:14:47.742\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n313\n00:14:47.742 --> 00:14:51.754\n>> Yeah, so the file format, if you know\nthat you're gonna need this to be backward\n\n314\n00:14:51.754 --> 00:14:54.890\ncompatible, notice that they\ngive you those options as well.\n\n315\n00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.560\nIf you know that you're the only one\nworking on the newest project 2013, but\n\n316\n00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.340\nyet you know that others\nare actually still on 2010 or\n\n317\n00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.470\n2007 you may choose one of those other\noptions and that way they can open it and\n\n318\n00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.030\nprobably be a little bit easier for\nthem to.\n\n319\n00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.092\n>> And that's important to remember\nbecause if you open up and project and\n\n320\n00:15:12.092 --> 00:15:16.561\nsay everyone in your company's on project\n2010 and you open up one of those\n\n321\n00:15:16.561 --> 00:15:18.492\nprojects and you save it,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:15:18.492 --> 00:15:19.453\n>> Under 2013,\n\n323\n00:15:19.453 --> 00:15:22.465\nwell now if somebody's running 2010 or\n2007,\n\n324\n00:15:22.465 --> 00:15:24.973\nit can't open that project anymore, right?\n\n325\n00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:29.317\nSo, it's important that we maintain that\ncompatibility until everybody's upgraded\n\n326\n00:15:29.317 --> 00:15:30.380\nand moving forward.\n\n327\n00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.030\n>> Now, one of the other options that's\nright here, which I find kind of neat,\n\n328\n00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.030\nis this one that's actually\nunchecked by default.\n\n329\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.130\nWhich says to auto save every ten minutes.\n\n330\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.430\nI found myself in situations which\nI wish that this stuff was on and\n\n331\n00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.570\nI didn't realize it, and now,\nI actually do want to save that.\n\n332\n00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.620\nBut ,you can also find yourself in\ntrouble if you make bad changes and\n\n333\n00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.570\nnow you're like, oh, I just have to\nclose a project out and open it back up.\n\n334\n00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.457\nWell, now it saved it every ten minutes.\n\n335\n00:15:55.457 --> 00:15:57.843\n>> Now, I know why this\none's turned off by default.\n\n336\n00:15:57.843 --> 00:16:02.374\nIn previous versions of Microsoft Project,\nyou had no way to do what-if scenarios.\n\n337\n00:16:02.374 --> 00:16:06.221\nAnd so what Microsoft always said was\nif you wanted to kind of do a possible\n\n338\n00:16:06.221 --> 00:16:10.067\nscenario, a what if type thing,\nwe usually do this with risk analysis,\n\n339\n00:16:10.067 --> 00:16:13.660\nif you wanna do a what if,\nsave your project, and then go through and\n\n340\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.405\njust make a bunch of changes.\n\n341\n00:16:15.405 --> 00:16:19.030\nThat kind of create your what-if scenario,\nand then see what happens, and\n\n342\n00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.050\nthen just close the project without\nsaving, and reopen it again.\n\n343\n00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.340\nAnd everything goes back to the way it was\nand you didn't mess with your project.\n\n344\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.910\nThat was the way you did\nwhat-if scenarios in every\n\n345\n00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.960\nprevious version of Microsoft Project.\n\n346\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.210\nIf you have auto save turned on,\nyou start to do your what-if scenario and\n\n347\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.210\nit saves it.\n\n348\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.710\nAnd now you're in deep trouble, right, cuz\nyou've got to try and undo all that stuff,\n\n349\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.690\nand maybe you missed something and\nnow you kinda screwed your project up.\n\n350\n00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.370\nSo that's why that's off by default,\n\n351\n00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.310\nyou can turn it on, I generally don't I'm\npretty good about hitting the save button.\n\n352\n00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.490\nBut you also do have some\nnew what if functionality,\n\n353\n00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.690\nwe'll see in another episode\ninside of Project 2013,\n\n354\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:56.360\nwhere we can start to spec out\nalternate paths for tasks.\n\n355\n00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.790\nSo it's not something we rely on as much\nas we used to, but if you're worried about\n\n356\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.920\naccidentally saving data in there, then\nyou want to make sure you turn that off.\n\n357\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.741\nAnd it is off by default.\n\n358\n00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:10.591\n>> Now, there's other options in here,\nchoosing using your default language,\n\n359\n00:17:10.591 --> 00:17:12.728\nof course, for what you're working with.\n\n360\n00:17:12.728 --> 00:17:16.532\nAnd then it is in the advance settings\nthat actually do overall effect\n\n361\n00:17:16.532 --> 00:17:18.290\nthe project itself.\n\n362\n00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.869\nYou can see where the undo levels, this\nis the one that I kind of key in here.\n\n363\n00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:28.200\nBack in Project 2003,\nI remember it was actually one undo.\n\n364\n00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:28.958\nAnd that was it.\n\n365\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you were like,\n\n366\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.550\nokay you kept hitting undo, and you're\nlike, okay go, it went back one time.\n\n367\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.810\nWell now they've actually saved that.\n\n368\n00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:39.640\nUsually by default I think they say that\nthey'll allow you to have up to 99 undo's,\n\n369\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.300\nbut here they actually show\nlike 20 levels of undo as well.\n\n370\n00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.840\nSo you may wanna change that and you might\nactually get that up to 99 if you're\n\n371\n00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.220\nas bad as I am at some of these things\nhere, where you have to undo quite a bit.\n\n372\n00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.530\nSo, you can see a lot of different options\nthat are actually displayed in here.\n\n373\n00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.760\nNow what if you wanna go a little\nbit further than that, Don?\n\n374\n00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.230\nWhat if you say, look, all these\ndifferent tabs that we have open up here,\n\n375\n00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.580\nthat we can actually go\nfrom one tab to another?\n\n376\n00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.185\nBut instead you wanted to be able\nto customize one for yourself.\n\n377\n00:18:10.185 --> 00:18:11.365\nYou can also do that as well.\n\n378\n00:18:11.365 --> 00:18:16.065\nYou can create your own customized ribbon\nand actually have it display up here, so\n\n379\n00:18:16.065 --> 00:18:19.695\nyou actually have all the tools\nthat you want available to you.\n\n380\n00:18:19.695 --> 00:18:22.865\nSo, instead of actually\nhaving to navigate around and\n\n381\n00:18:22.865 --> 00:18:25.540\nfigure out what you actually want,\nyou may actually go ahead and\n\n382\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.940\nchoose that option as well,\nif I go back to the options.\n\n383\n00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.960\n>> Yeah, you'll find most people really\njust have a small subset of tools that\n\n384\n00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.120\nare used on a regular basis.\n\n385\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.660\nSo if we can put all those\ntools on one ribbon section,\n\n386\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.330\nit does make life a lot easier for us.\n\n387\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.810\nBut Microsoft doesn't know what\ntools you like the best, and so\n\n388\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.970\nthat's why they divide it up in\na logical category kind of set up.\n\n389\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:44.960\nWe can create our own right?\n\n390\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.600\n>> Right.\n\n391\n00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.600\nSo if you take a look at\nthe project options again, and\n\n392\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.390\nyou go down to where it says\nCustomize Ribbons, notice that you can\n\n393\n00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.860\nchoose from the most popular commands or\nif you are daring, of course,\n\n394\n00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.410\nyou can list every single command and try\nand go through every single one of those.\n\n395\n00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.070\nAnd if you do that,\nman look at that little scroll bar,\n\n396\n00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.680\nit went from actually filling\nup the entire page here.\n\n397\n00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.200\nWhere you're actually seeing about three,\ntwo-thirds of the page.\n\n398\n00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.850\nAnd now you go to All Commands,\nit now turns tiny.\n\n399\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:14.510\nAnd they mean every single\ncommand if you choose to do that.\n\n400\n00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.540\nBut I'm just gonna choose this\nPopular Options for right now.\n\n401\n00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.400\nAnd notice it says I can customize\na ribbon if I want to but,\n\n402\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.910\nwhat if I wanted to make\nmy own section of tools?\n\n403\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:26.995\nI can do that as well.\n\n404\n00:19:26.995 --> 00:19:30.040\nSo under the main tabs,\nnotice over here on the right hand side,\n\n405\n00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:36.620\nI can select a new tab, if I wanted to,\nand now in this new tab, I can rename it.\n\n406\n00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.200\nSo I'm gonna rename it and\nI'm gonna call it Ronnie's Tools.\n\n407\n00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.242\nClick OK.\nAnd now,\n\n408\n00:19:44.242 --> 00:19:48.474\nonce I actually have that new section,\nI can now use,\n\n409\n00:19:48.474 --> 00:19:53.646\nwell this section over here on\nthe left hand side and I can select,\n\n410\n00:19:53.646 --> 00:20:00.169\nI'm gonna create new and maybe open some\nold project plans that I have available.\n\n411\n00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:04.332\nI may want to actually do let's say,\nPrint Preview, and\n\n412\n00:20:04.332 --> 00:20:08.518\nthen some of the other views\nthat I might have available.\n\n413\n00:20:08.518 --> 00:20:10.424\nLet's see,\nlet's just show like Status Date.\n\n414\n00:20:10.424 --> 00:20:13.148\n>> And notice how some of those have a\nlittle black arrow off to the right, that\n\n415\n00:20:13.148 --> 00:20:16.175\ntells you that it's actually a drop down,\nso it'll appear on the bar as a button and\n\n416\n00:20:16.175 --> 00:20:18.317\nyou click it and\nthere will be more options underneath it.\n\n417\n00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:20.617\nSo it's like getting more than\none function at the same time.\n\n418\n00:20:20.617 --> 00:20:23.321\nAnd he's also just in\nthe popular options view.\n\n419\n00:20:23.321 --> 00:20:27.948\nSo if you switch to some of the other\ndrop downs there you can pick from things\n\n420\n00:20:27.948 --> 00:20:31.847\nthat are focused more on formating or\nscheduling or whatever.\n\n421\n00:20:31.847 --> 00:20:36.100\nYou just pick and choose whatever it\nis that you use on a regular basis.\n\n422\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.485\n>> So I'm just gonna do that\njust as an example and click OK.\n\n423\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.740\nAnd once I do that notice\nthat now there it is.\n\n424\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.090\nThere is my section of tools and\n\n425\n00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.930\nif I wanted to continue to add\nin more tools I could do that.\n\n426\n00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.760\nInstead of having to go to every single\nlittle tab that I have available,\n\n427\n00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.490\nthere's all of my tools readily\navailable right there as well.\n\n428\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.710\nAnd that might be something\nthat you choose to do,\n\n429\n00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.880\ncuz that makes it easier in navigation,\nnot having to figure out, oh, yeah,\n\n430\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.300\nthat was on this tab,\nthat was on this tab.\n\n431\n00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.480\nI like it.\n\n432\n00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.900\n>> Well, now Ronnie, let's say I didn't\nwant to mess with the tabs at all.\n\n433\n00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:07.410\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n434\n00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.570\nSo, cuz maybe I changed to\na different tab to get a tool that I\n\n435\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.370\ndon't get to too often.\n\n436\n00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.005\nAnd then I gotta remember to go\nback to Ronnie's Tools, right?\n\n437\n00:21:14.005 --> 00:21:15.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I don't want to mess with that there\n\n438\n00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.280\nis a way to make something\nappear on the screen\n\n439\n00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.300\nall the time regardless\nof what tab I'm on.\n\n440\n00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.979\n>> There is, it's up here in\nthe upper left hand corner and\n\n441\n00:21:21.979 --> 00:21:25.798\nwhen you take a look at these options you\ncan actually see they've already set up\n\n442\n00:21:25.798 --> 00:21:27.750\nthree options for us right away.\n\n443\n00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.640\nAnd this is what they call\nthe quick access toolbar.\n\n444\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.040\nSo they have a save, they have the undo,\nand they have the redo and they have this\n\n445\n00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:39.080\nlittle unusual drop down here that says,\nCustomize Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n446\n00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.100\nAnd of course you can get\nto it directly from here\n\n447\n00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.890\nwhere you can add in\nsome more information.\n\n448\n00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.690\nAnd notice they've already set\nit up by default they only have\n\n449\n00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.830\nthese three showing up.\n\n450\n00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.230\nIf I wanted to add in just\na couple of new ones there,\n\n451\n00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.270\nall I have to do is actually\njust select it, and go to Open.\n\n452\n00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.640\nAnd notice it starts filling this in, and\n\n453\n00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:03.020\nthat way we don't have to actually even\nuse the ribbon or the tabs themselves.\n\n454\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:08.920\nAll of my single one click, easy ways to\ndo things, I can have it up here as well.\n\n455\n00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.160\nNow remember that you can also\ngo to File and Options, and\n\n456\n00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.570\nyou also have that ability to\ncustomize it from right here too.\n\n457\n00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:18.990\nSo, the couple ways to get access to it,\nand\n\n458\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.030\nyou may find yourself,\nthat's the way I want to work.\n\n459\n00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:25.410\nI don't want to deal with the ribbons at\nall, or the different tabs at all, and\n\n460\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.300\nbe able to that.\n\n461\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.930\nMakes it nice and easy,\nvery quick for us to be able to do.\n\n462\n00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:30.590\n>> Yeah.\n\n463\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.640\nSo, it's definitely a neat\nthing you can customize.\n\n464\n00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.870\nChanging those ribbons,\nthat really does make a big difference.\n\n465\n00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.010\nEspecially if you're having\na hard time finding things.\n\n466\n00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.560\nMaybe you just upgraded from\nProject 2000 or 2003 and\n\n467\n00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.450\nyou're not used to the ribbon view yet.\n\n468\n00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.530\nRight?\n\n469\n00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.920\nAnd that happens.\n\n470\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.500\nAnd so if you skipped over\nProject 2007 for example.\n\n471\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.780\nWas it 2007 when the ribbons\nwere introduced?\n\n472\n00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.770\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay.\n\n473\n00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.472\nSo if you skipped over those versions and\nyou're just jumping into 2013,\n\n474\n00:22:54.472 --> 00:22:57.892\nthese are good ways that you can kinda\nget around that, not having to deal\n\n475\n00:22:57.892 --> 00:23:01.004\nwith ribbons or creating ribbons\nthat are really useful for you.\n\n476\n00:23:01.004 --> 00:23:03.660\nAll right well Ronnie, I think that's\na pretty good run down of the options.\n\n477\n00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:08.150\nDo we have any other ones\nthat we wanna really tackle?\n\n478\n00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.536\nI do know one that I wanna mention.\n\n479\n00:23:09.536 --> 00:23:13.330\nYou guys might have noticed in the options\nscreen there was an add ins section.\n\n480\n00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.460\nAnd in the add in section, that's where we\ncan extend the functionality of project,\n\n481\n00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.010\nand for\n\n482\n00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.910\nmost people extending functionality\nprojects gonna be one of two things.\n\n483\n00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.052\nIt's either one you are gonna be\nconnecting to a project server.\n\n484\n00:23:24.052 --> 00:23:30.594\nOr two connecting to something like\nthe visual studio team foundation server.\n\n485\n00:23:30.594 --> 00:23:34.061\nAnd that's where, if you're doing\nsoftware management projects,\n\n486\n00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:37.939\nyou might have software builds happening\nover on your foundation server, and\n\n487\n00:23:37.939 --> 00:23:40.743\nthen here inside of Project\nyou can tie into that.\n\n488\n00:23:40.743 --> 00:23:44.230\nAnd so we recognize the build as\noccurring on this date or that date.\n\n489\n00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.730\nSo you can really expand Project and\nthere's third party companies out there\n\n490\n00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.670\nthat sell software that can integrate a\nproject and do all sorts of crazy things.\n\n491\n00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.290\nI'm seeing some pretty impressive billing\nsystems that tap into Project and\n\n492\n00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.380\nother things like that.\n\n493\n00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.080\nDefinitely a lot of extensibility there,\n\n494\n00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.320\nand it makes it an even more powerful\nproduct than what it already is.\n\n495\n00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.450\nIt really does.\n\n496\n00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.870\n>> There's only one other option\nthat we need to show you here,\n\n497\n00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:11.260\nwhich is what we call calendar options\ntoo, that are actually inside of Project.\n\n498\n00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.880\nNow, unusually, when we actually went\nto those options inside of that,\n\n499\n00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.690\nyou know, the back stage here.\n\n500\n00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:19.330\nThe options.\n\n501\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.300\nI don't see calendar options\nright here very easily.\n\n502\n00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.510\nWe did see some of the options\nthat we can change.\n\n503\n00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.370\nBut if you wanna see some of the calendar\noptions what you'll need to do is go to\n\n504\n00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:31.520\nthe Project tab and\nthen select Change Working Times.\n\n505\n00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.630\nAnd then down here at the bottom\nis where you actually have this\n\n506\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.720\nlittle button that says Options.\n\n507\n00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.420\nAnd notice it brings us back to\nthe Schedule, so it's actually showing us\n\n508\n00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.720\nthe same thing, so\nthat's what we'll also end up seeing too.\n\n509\n00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.300\nSo I didn't see that on Schedule,\n\n510\n00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.080\nI thought it was gonna lead\nus someplace different.\n\n511\n00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.740\nBut there we have some of the options too.\n\n512\n00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.780\nSo if you happen to see that in one way or\nthe other,\n\n513\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.960\nyou'll be changing those options there.\n\n514\n00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.460\n>> It's kinda like the Quick Access Bar.\n\n515\n00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.521\nYou'll find that there's more than one\nway to get to the options screen, and so\n\n516\n00:24:57.521 --> 00:24:59.759\nyou can go straight to the options and\nset them all at once or\n\n517\n00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:02.202\nyou can hit it piecemeal as you\ngo through configuring things.\n\n518\n00:25:02.202 --> 00:25:05.106\nBut one lesson I've learned\nover the years is that,\n\n519\n00:25:05.106 --> 00:25:09.198\nit's almost always better to set these\noptions early on in your project,\n\n520\n00:25:09.198 --> 00:25:11.851\nbefore you start dumping\na ton of data in there.\n\n521\n00:25:11.851 --> 00:25:15.172\nBecause otherwise if you change it after\nthe fact you can get your tasks to be\n\n522\n00:25:15.172 --> 00:25:16.290\ninconsistent, right?\n\n523\n00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:19.030\nThings might not match\nup between old tasks and\n\n524\n00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.940\nnew tasks that were created\naround that option being set.\n\n525\n00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.530\nAll right, well Ronnie,\nthis is probably a pretty good spot for\n\n526\n00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.840\nus to wrap this one up, so\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n527\n00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.770\nHope you guys enjoyed it, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n528\n00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:31.550\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n529\n00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.936\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n530\n00:25:32.936 --> 00:25:37.144\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.986\ngood evening, welcome back to\nanother episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.986 --> 00:00:20.155\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again with\nMr. Ronnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:22.485\n>> It is going well today, I'm doing well,\n\n6\n00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:25.410\nready to get started into\nsome Microsoft Project.\n\n7\n00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.130\n>> Now today we are going to take a look\nat getting an initial project set up.\n\n8\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.480\nNow when you create a new project,\nyou fire up Microsoft Project and\n\n9\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.320\nhit the little new button and\nit drop you right into a Gann chart and\n\n10\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.910\nyou are ready to go,\nstart dumping data in.\n\n11\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.920\nWell there is an important step you should\ntake every time you create a new project,\n\n12\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.450\nand that is setting some of\nthe default project information and\n\n13\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.460\nthis is really critical stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.680\nIt can be changed after the fact, but boy,\n\n15\n00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.340\ndoes it make life\ndifficult if you do that.\n\n16\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.580\nSo when you create a new project,\n\n17\n00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.530\nthese are the things that we need\nto do right at the very beginning.\n\n18\n00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.070\nRight, Ronnie?\n\n19\n00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.020\n>> It really helps.\n\n20\n00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.620\nWhen you start actually getting some\ntasks already entered in there, and\n\n21\n00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.400\nas long as you're actually just getting\nit set up, you don't want things to start\n\n22\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.920\nmaybe on the day that you're starting,\nbut usually by default,\n\n23\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.680\nthat's what's gonna end up happening if\nit doesn't know any other information.\n\n24\n00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.570\nAnd so all of the tasks that you have,\nyou'll actually see that they'll\n\n25\n00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.250\nstart on the date that you're probably in,\nand you probably don't want to do that.\n\n26\n00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.320\nWhat you wanna do,\nof course, is adjust it, and\n\n27\n00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.580\nmake sure that it's actually starting\non the day that you want it to start.\n\n28\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.960\nSo what we're gonna be dealing with here\nin this segment, is we're gonna be taking\n\n29\n00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.620\na look at the project information that we\nneed to set up in the background that will\n\n30\n00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.240\nthen allow all of our tasks to adjust and\npin point out for that day.\n\n31\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.690\nNow you might be thinking why\nis a single date so important?\n\n32\n00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.420\nIt's because of the way that project\nactually starts to schedule things out,\n\n33\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.880\nthat as long as we have a start date,\n\n34\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.640\nwhat we'll actually see is we that we\nreally don't have to actually enter in\n\n35\n00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.020\nany other dates from that point on unless\nwe want to actually manually do so.\n\n36\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.500\nThat project can use that one date and\ncalculate out everything else that we need\n\n37\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.870\nto and so, that's why this is\na very important subject for us.\n\n38\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.970\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at how we do that.\n\n39\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.665\nSo inside of Microsoft Project, what\nwe wanna do Is we want to go ahead and\n\n40\n00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:09.975\nI have a project plan, open up that,\nit just has task listed.\n\n41\n00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:13.955\nSo before I set any of the other\nconnections that I need, I want to go into\n\n42\n00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:18.970\nproject and on the project tab,\nI want to select project information.\n\n43\n00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.500\nAnd with the project information for\nthis one task, here is some of the most\n\n44\n00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.660\nimportant information that we can actually\ntake a look at, and start with as well.\n\n45\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.580\nSo notice that right here for\nthis project, what we're talking about as\n\n46\n00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.470\na start date, is not necessarily\nthe current date that we have,\n\n47\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.630\neven though it actually\nseems like it can match up.\n\n48\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.140\nMine's actually a day off here.\n\n49\n00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.150\nBut when you take a look at this here,\nwhat we're trying to do is,\n\n50\n00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.340\nwe're going to say, hey, when do I\nreally want this project to begin, so\n\n51\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.040\nall the calculations will start\nhappening from that particular date.\n\n52\n00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.320\nAnd so, this actually does allow you\nto go backward in time as well as\n\n53\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.360\nforward in time.\n\n54\n00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.330\nThe nice thing about\nMicrosoft Project 2013,\n\n55\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.790\nis that they increased\nthe range of time that you had.\n\n56\n00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.910\nNow before with Project 2010,\nI think it actually went to 2049.\n\n57\n00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.340\nSo don't get me wrong,\nit's still a good number of years.\n\n58\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.160\nBut with project 2013 it goes to 2149,\nso they added in an extra\n\n59\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.870\n100 years just in case you're really\ntrying to project out the next generation.\n\n60\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.600\n>> You never know.\n\n61\n00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.530\n>> Yeah, a hundred year\nproject I guess is possible.\n\n62\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.890\nSo at this point, that's what I wanna do.\n\n63\n00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.460\nNormally, if I'm actually\ngiven the information,\n\n64\n00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.560\nI can then just use the little\ncalendar right here and\n\n65\n00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.920\nthen scroll through to the dates\nthat I want to begin to start.\n\n66\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.020\nNow you don't always have to pick this.\n\n67\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.430\nYou can manually type it in.\n\n68\n00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.170\nLet me just select here for August and\nI'm just going to select the 17th\n\n69\n00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.950\njust as an example,\nto start my project on that date.\n\n70\n00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.030\nNow you do want to make sure you have the\ncurrent date selected correctly as well.\n\n71\n00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.210\nUsually that's gonna take your\nsystem clock and today is the 14th.\n\n72\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.700\nAnd I'm just gonna leave it right there,\nbut\n\n73\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.810\nnotice that the finish date at this point,\nit's grayed out.\n\n74\n00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.160\nDon, there's nothing I can\nactually do about that.\n\n75\n00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.860\nIt just looks like it's, hey look, you're\nnot gonna do anything about this right\n\n76\n00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.940\nnow, so at this point here, even though it\nactually says that the finish date is on\n\n77\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.010\nthe 13th, it's gonna adjust it for\nme as I start filling things out.\n\n78\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.590\n>> Yeah, and\nthat's actually a calculated field,\n\n79\n00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.340\nwhich is why you can't\ntype anything in there.\n\n80\n00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.300\nWhen you choose that start date, now every\ntask that we create, every task we've put\n\n81\n00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.670\nin there is gonna default to starting at,\nwell, August 14 in this case.\n\n82\n00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.457\nAnd as I link other tasks to it it's\ngonna expand out from there and\n\n83\n00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:32.700\nif I've got five days worth of tasks or\n\n84\n00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.540\nfive months worth of tasks, that's how\nit's going to figure out my finish dates.\n\n85\n00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.750\nSo based on the tasks\nthat I have right now,\n\n86\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.330\nmy finish date is going\nto match my start date.\n\n87\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.890\nI don't have any or\nthey all finished on the same day.\n\n88\n00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.570\nAs we start making our tasks take longer,\nthat date will change.\n\n89\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.570\nAnd the reason it's doing this,\nis because the default type of project.\n\n90\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.250\nWhen you create a project\nin Microsoft Project,\n\n91\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.440\nthe default is to have a start date and\nnot have a finish date.\n\n92\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.590\nSo if somebody comes to you and they give\nyou a project and they say, all right,\n\n93\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.040\nRonnie, I need you to manage this project.\n\n94\n00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.900\nI need you to start immediately.\n\n95\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.080\nStart right now and\njust get done as soon as you can.\n\n96\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.860\nI don't have a fixed finish date,\nI have a flexible finish date.\n\n97\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.530\nI've got a fixed start date,\nI need to start right now, and\n\n98\n00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.650\nthat's the default way\nthat project functions.\n\n99\n00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.090\nBut it's not always like that,\nis it, Ronnie?\n\n100\n00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.320\nSometimes somebody comes to you with a\nproject, and they say, Ronnie, I need you\n\n101\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.440\nget this terminal server deployed, and\nI need it up and running by December 31st.\n\n102\n00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.640\nI don't care if you start today.\n\n103\n00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.980\nI don't care if you start next week.\n\n104\n00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.615\nI don't care if you\nstart on December 30th.\n\n105\n00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:38.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just need it done by December 31st.\n\n106\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.980\nAnd in that case, we need to change\nthe behavior of our project, right?\n\n107\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.040\n>> If you wanna change that behavior,\nnotice that what we're talking about right\n\n108\n00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.700\nhere is where we have this option in\nthis field that says schedule from.\n\n109\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.130\nThe default is a project start date, so\nalways begin with that project start date.\n\n110\n00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.000\nAnd that will give you the flexibility\nthat you need to make sure that when you\n\n111\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.460\nstart, this is where everything\nis going to calculate from and\n\n112\n00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.120\nthen where ever it ends, it ends.\n\n113\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.059\nBut if I need to finish by a certain date,\n\n114\n00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:09.073\nI can choose this drop down and\nselect project finish date instead and\n\n115\n00:06:09.073 --> 00:06:14.433\nnow notice that the start date now\ngets calculated, not calculated out,\n\n116\n00:06:14.433 --> 00:06:18.755\nbut grayed out here and\nthen I can choose that finish date and\n\n117\n00:06:18.755 --> 00:06:24.060\nlet me go ahead and select what Don\nsaid here, which is December 31st.\n\n118\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.038\nAnd so this will now actually start to\nhappen where it will try and schedule\n\n119\n00:06:28.038 --> 00:06:32.273\nthings by default as late as it possibly\ncan to make sure that we finish on time,\n\n120\n00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:34.800\nand we're working\nbackward on our schedule.\n\n121\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.740\nAnd you'll see where this\nlittle description right here,\n\n122\n00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.570\nwhere it actually says all task\nbegin as late as possible.\n\n123\n00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.260\nWhen I selected the project start date, it\nsays all task begin as soon as possible.\n\n124\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.830\nSo that we can actually finish earlier,\nbut if I do have that finish date,\n\n125\n00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.900\nI'm gonna do that.\n\n126\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.550\nNow usually, what I've actually\nunderstood about this that even if you\n\n127\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.940\nhave this project finish date and\nyou want to start scheduling from that,\n\n128\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.760\nthis is like working through what\nyou call different constraints.\n\n129\n00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.550\nThere's like concrete set in this plan\nright from the beginning that you think,\n\n130\n00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.780\noh it's gonna automatically adjust and\nmake me do this.\n\n131\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.620\nYou may find out that you're actually\nhaving to jump through a lot more hoops to\n\n132\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.050\nget it working this way.\n\n133\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.950\nBut you can do it.\n\n134\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.605\n>> Yeah, well it's challenging, but\n\n135\n00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:16.205\nit does come down to the type\nof project you're running.\n\n136\n00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:20.795\nSo let's say for example, you're in\nconstruction and you're building a house.\n\n137\n00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:24.295\nAnd the buyer for the house, the people\nthat are gonna move in, they say, boy,\n\n138\n00:07:24.295 --> 00:07:25.975\nI'd really like to move in by August 31st.\n\n139\n00:07:27.182 --> 00:07:29.662\nSo you have a finished date,\nI want to be done by August 31st.\n\n140\n00:07:29.662 --> 00:07:32.972\nBut are they going to complain\nif you finish on August 20th.\n\n141\n00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:36.202\nNo, I don't want it on August 20th,\nI want it on August 31st.\n\n142\n00:07:36.202 --> 00:07:39.912\nThey're not going to complain,\nthey'd be excited to get it early.\n\n143\n00:07:39.912 --> 00:07:43.422\nSo for something like that\nthe start date is more important.\n\n144\n00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:46.512\nI want to get it started as soon as\nI can and finish as early as I can.\n\n145\n00:07:46.512 --> 00:07:48.512\nIt's not really a fixed finish date.\n\n146\n00:07:48.512 --> 00:07:53.170\nBut what if your project is\nputting on a rock concert, and\n\n147\n00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.270\na rock concert is on August 31st.\n\n148\n00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.310\nSo on August 31st the stage has to be up,\nthe tickets have to be sold,\n\n149\n00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.158\nthe security guards have to be there,\nand the concert has to go on.\n\n150\n00:08:04.158 --> 00:08:05.957\nAre people gonna complain\nif we finish early,\n\n151\n00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:07.394\nthe concert wraps up two days early?\n\n152\n00:08:07.394 --> 00:08:08.820\nYeah, they're gonna complain!\n\n153\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.740\nThey have a ticket for August 31st,\nthat's when they planned to be there.\n\n154\n00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:17.510\nSo that is a fixed finish date, and\nno matter what happens in the setup,\n\n155\n00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.680\neven if you get done early, maybe all\nyour setup is done two days early.\n\n156\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.350\nWell, now you get to sit around and\nwaste time for\n\n157\n00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.430\ntwo days cuz the concert's\nnot until the 31st.\n\n158\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.590\nSo that's where we have\nthese different choices.\n\n159\n00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.890\nMicrosoft, they can't predict\nwhich one you're going to need.\n\n160\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.840\nThey don't know what you're being told.\n\n161\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.310\nThat's why it's so\nimportant to set this early on.\n\n162\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.680\nAnd for those of you with\na project management background,\n\n163\n00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.940\nyou might have also heard this referred\nto as scheduling from left to right,\n\n164\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.800\nversus scheduling right to left.\n\n165\n00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.570\nAnd that terminology is\nreferring to your timeline.\n\n166\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.770\nSo on the left side of your timeline,\nyou've got today.\n\n167\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.070\nAnd on the right side of your timeline,\nyou've got the end of the project.\n\n168\n00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.780\nOr a Gantt chart.\n\n169\n00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.340\nSame thing.\n\n170\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.000\nLeft is today.\n\n171\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.560\nRight is the end of the project.\n\n172\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.980\nAnd if you schedule from left to right,\nthat means you're going from the beginning\n\n173\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.290\nand scheduling out and\nfiguring out where the end is.\n\n174\n00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.030\nBut from right to left, you're coming\nfrom that end and scheduling backwards.\n\n175\n00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.940\nBackwards saying, all right,\nthis is a five day task.\n\n176\n00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.820\nThis is a four day task.\n\n177\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.890\nThis is a three day task.\n\n178\n00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:16.270\nIf I want them all to finish on August 31,\nI need to start on this date.\n\n179\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.430\nAnd we kind of calculate it out.\n\n180\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.260\nSo it's definitely a different\nway of looking at the project.\n\n181\n00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.850\nAnd it comes down to the project itself,\nwhether you have a fixed finish date, or\n\n182\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.430\nwhether it's okay to finish early.\n\n183\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.190\nThat's what's gonna\nmanipulate these values.\n\n184\n00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.950\n>> And so this really needs some of\nthe information we have right here and\n\n185\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.820\nthey way that we'll actually be\nable to schedule things too.\n\n186\n00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.290\nI went in just changed it back to\nthe project does start date right now, but\n\n187\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.400\nyes you can actually change that.\n\n188\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.520\nNow the other one that is also here\nis what we call status date two.\n\n189\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.340\nSo we can go and setup the date and\nthat we're actually going to\n\n190\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.840\ntake a status of our project, sometimes it\nmaybe when we're finishing things up and\n\n191\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.370\ntake a baseline of this date.\n\n192\n00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.130\nAnd I wanna actually go ahead and\nmark that for\n\n193\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.760\nus to be able to do that as well and\nthen another option here is the calendar.\n\n194\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.920\nNow remember that by default, in project,\n\n195\n00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.330\nwhen you first open up a plan,\nyou have these three default calendars.\n\n196\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.190\nThe 24 hour, the night shift and\nthe standard calendar.\n\n197\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.100\nAnd those will work.\n\n198\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.740\nIf you actually wanna\njust set it like that.\n\n199\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.630\nRemember, the standard calendar's gonna\ngive us that 8 hour work day with that one\n\n200\n00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.970\nhour break in between.\n\n201\n00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.510\nThe 24 hour calendar is\nactually no breaks at all.\n\n202\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.180\n24 hours a day, and\nthen there's that night shift counter.\n\n203\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.980\nAnd both Don and I said,\n\n204\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.370\nwell, dubiously we're not exactly sure\nhow you really use that one effectively.\n\n205\n00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.340\nBut you can choose those options.\n\n206\n00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.240\nBut remember that these don't come\nwith any of those holidays or\n\n207\n00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.110\nanything like that already set in.\n\n208\n00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.610\nSo if you're gonna actually do something\nlike this you can actually choose and\n\n209\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.980\ncreate your own calendar, and\nthat calendar will show up here, and\n\n210\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.250\nthen your project will follow\nthat calendar on its guidelines.\n\n211\n00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.210\nIf you have holidays set\nup it will follow that,\n\n212\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.150\nif you have other non-default working\ntimes it will also follow that too.\n\n213\n00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.700\n>> And let me add a little\nsomething on the status date.\n\n214\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.930\nOn the initial project setup\nlike we're doing here,\n\n215\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.930\nyou usually ignore status date and you\ndon't mess with it and it's set to N/A or\n\n216\n00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.370\nnon applicable, so\nwe just kind of ignore it.\n\n217\n00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.510\nBut later on in your project that status\ndate's gonna become really important.\n\n218\n00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.150\nAnd so you'll find that you return\nto this project information screen\n\n219\n00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.570\nall throughout your project\nto update that status date.\n\n220\n00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.840\nNow, status date is used for\none really critical thing.\n\n221\n00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.240\nAnd that's for data entry.\n\n222\n00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.770\nSo let me give you guys an example.\n\n223\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.280\nSo if I got a project and I've got\n30 tasks going on at the same time.\n\n224\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.890\nI need those people to\ngive me status reports.\n\n225\n00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:25.090\nSo maybe my company we've got where\nat the end of the day on Friday,\n\n226\n00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.610\neverybody has to submit a status\nreport to the project manager, so\n\n227\n00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.160\nthat I know how far they got done.\n\n228\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.280\nMaybe they're 20% done, maybe they're\n80% done, but I need to know.\n\n229\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.440\nSo they've got until the end of the day,\nFriday.\n\n230\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.450\nAnd maybe I've got somebody who turns\nit in at 4:59 PM on Friday, and\n\n231\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.210\nI'm in a hurry to get out of the office,\nso I don't have time to turn it in.\n\n232\n00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.460\nSo I just set it on my desk,\nand then I leave.\n\n233\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.530\nWhen I come back in Monday morning,\nI sit down and\n\n234\n00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.840\nI go to put that status\nupdate into Project.\n\n235\n00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.510\nI want to say, all right, 80% done and\nI want to put it in right then.\n\n236\n00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.620\nWell, when you put in status updates,\n\n237\n00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.870\nby default,\nit's going to time into the current date.\n\n238\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:07.960\nSo when he submitted the form to me,\nhe was saying I'm 80% done on Friday.\n\n239\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.270\nBut if I don't enter it in until Monday,\n\n240\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.870\nI'm telling project he's\n80% done on Monday.\n\n241\n00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.210\nAnd that's not really true.\n\n242\n00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.890\nHe was 80% done back on Friday.\n\n243\n00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.640\nI just put that task two\ndays behind schedule\n\n244\n00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.670\nbecause I didn't enter the status report\nin the day that it was turned in.\n\n245\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.340\nSo what we do is we come in here and\nchange the status date.\n\n246\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.960\nAnd I might say hey, it's Monday, but\n\n247\n00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.120\nI'm going to change that\nstatus date to be last Friday.\n\n248\n00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.840\nAnd now, when I start to enter\nin those status reports,\n\n249\n00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.620\nit's saying that it was\n80 percent on Friday.\n\n250\n00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.810\nSo that's manipulating how\nour data entry happens.\n\n251\n00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.100\nThat's why we don't really care\nabout the option right now, but\n\n252\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.730\nlater on it's super important, any time\nyou are entering in new task performance\n\n253\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.480\ndata You gotta adjust that to when that\nperformance data was given to you.\n\n254\n00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.140\n>> There's also this last option that we\nhave right here that we call priority.\n\n255\n00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.700\nAnd this is actually a field that we can\nrange I believe from one to 1,000 and\n\n256\n00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.310\nthis is about resource leveling when we\nhave resources now assigned to projects\n\n257\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.220\nand it actually gives us the ability to\ngo in and say hey, here's something that\n\n258\n00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.780\nI want to actually be able to be level,\nand here are other things I don't want to.\n\n259\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.050\nBy setting it on the project itself,\nif you set it at the high number,\n\n260\n00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.940\nI believe, at 1,000, you're saying look,\n\n261\n00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.450\nI really don't want anything really\nleveled out to adjust for over allocation.\n\n262\n00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.110\nAnd if you set it at the one\nit's saying over adjust for\n\n263\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.380\nthe over allocation at anytime you can,\nas quick as you can.\n\n264\n00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.010\nUsually 500 is default for\njust about everything we have in project.\n\n265\n00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.180\n>> Yeah.\nAnd you can override that on a per\n\n266\n00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.000\ntask basis.\n\n267\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.840\nYou can go in and change it.\n\n268\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.230\nAnd you notice like, Ron,\nif you click your arrows there.\n\n269\n00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.210\nIt actually moves up and\ndown in increments of 10,\n\n270\n00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.540\nso it goes from 500 to 510 to 520 and\nso on.\n\n271\n00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.970\n>> And this one does 20 by default.\n\n272\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:50.710\n>> Increments of 20?\n\n273\n00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:51.310\n>> Yeah.\n\n274\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.840\n>> I might be wrong.\n\n275\n00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.430\nOh, it sure does.\n\n276\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.730\nLook at that, 20.\nI could have sworn it was 10.\n\n277\n00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.130\nWell, it moves up in increments, and\n\n278\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.730\nthe reason it's doing that is\nto leave you room in between.\n\n279\n00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.370\nIf I've got two tasks that\nare scheduled at the same time, and\n\n280\n00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.580\nI've got seven hours of labor\nto divide between them,\n\n281\n00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.910\none of them's gonna get four hours and\none of them's gonna get three hours.\n\n282\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.090\nHow does it pick?\n\n283\n00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.560\nWell, the higher priority task is going to\nget the resources and the other one's not.\n\n284\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.860\nSo one will get four hours,\none will get three hours, and\n\n285\n00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.480\nwe can manipulate that priority.\n\n286\n00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.460\nIf you have two tasks that both\nhave a priority of 500, it's a tie.\n\n287\n00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.610\nWho wins?\n\n288\n00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.400\nWell on the tasks I can override that.\n\n289\n00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.560\nAnd I can make one 501 versus 500.\n\n290\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.500\nSo that's why they move up in increments\nof 20 is to give you that gap.\n\n291\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.190\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n292\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.190\nBut if I have one that's 501 and\none that's 502 and\n\n293\n00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.800\nI want to put something in between them,\nthere's no room in between them.\n\n294\n00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.700\nI can't do it.\n\n295\n00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.140\nBut if I skip by 20s I've got that room,\n\n296\n00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.190\nI can make one 510 and\nthen you've got one in between.\n\n297\n00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.750\nSo, it's an interesting option.\n\n298\n00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.100\nHere we're just setting the default.\n\n299\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.370\nThe default priority for\nall of our stuff is gonna be 500,\n\n300\n00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.680\nwhich is right in the middle.\n\n301\n00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.270\nIt goes from zero to 1,000,\nthis puts it right in the middle.\n\n302\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.230\n>> The other nice option that we\nhave here in the project information\n\n303\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.770\nis this statistic button.\n\n304\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.860\nIt doesn't really account for much right\nnow, what it actually gives me the ability\n\n305\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:10.090\nto see, of course, is my project start and\nfinish dates on this nice little,\n\n306\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.720\neasy report that they give so\nthat way I can see what's going on.\n\n307\n00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.400\nIf we start entering in things\nlike the status date and\n\n308\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.610\nupdating it, these numbers will also\nchange and be available for us.\n\n309\n00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.680\nBut this is great for a project manager\nbecause he actually has one place where\n\n310\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.910\nhe can go and get a lot of statistics\nright away to be able to see that.\n\n311\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.460\nYeah, it closes out the entire\nproject information\n\n312\n00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.725\nwindow every time I select it so.\n\n313\n00:15:32.725 --> 00:15:34.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I keep going back to it.\n\n314\n00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.000\nSo it is a nice little location.\n\n315\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.990\nThat we can get a lot of information and\nbe able to see it right away.\n\n316\n00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.730\nBut setting this stuff up at\nthe very beginning is what you\n\n317\n00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.550\nreally want to be able to do,\nbecause this will then go ahead and\n\n318\n00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:52.750\naffect all the other tasks\nthat you have from here.\n\n319\n00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.725\nAnd that's what will start\nhappening if I select these tasks.\n\n320\n00:15:55.725 --> 00:15:58.646\nThey'll start filling in those dates,\nbut from the project start date.\n\n321\n00:15:58.646 --> 00:15:59.954\n>> Yeah, all right, well Ronnie,\n\n322\n00:15:59.954 --> 00:16:03.056\nthat's a pretty good overview of\nthe various project information settings.\n\n323\n00:16:03.056 --> 00:16:06.217\nDo remember,\nsetting these early is always better.\n\n324\n00:16:06.217 --> 00:16:07.979\nSo this is one of the first\nthings that we set.\n\n325\n00:16:07.979 --> 00:16:10.216\nAnd, I don't we covered it\nin the other episode, but\n\n326\n00:16:10.216 --> 00:16:13.090\nthere's actually an option\ninside of our project options.\n\n327\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.460\nYou know let's show this real quick,\ncuz we do have some time.\n\n328\n00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.040\nIf you go into your\nMicrosoft project options.\n\n329\n00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.840\n>> Microsoft, yep.\n\n330\n00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.780\n>> You got it right.\n\n331\n00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.400\nSo if you jump into those options,\nyou could go down to advanced.\n\n332\n00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.630\nAnd inside of advanced,\nthere's an option tucked away in there to\n\n333\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:31.740\ndisplay the project information screen\nevery time you create a new project.\n\n334\n00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.620\nIt's kinda one of the options\nnested away there.\n\n335\n00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.410\nAnd, let me see if I can remember,\nit's one of those options where you\n\n336\n00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.530\njust set it once and\nthen you never have to set it again.\n\n337\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.180\nSo it is tucked away under,\n\n338\n00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.020\nif you go under Advanced, it's right\nthere up at the top under General.\n\n339\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.580\nThe second option, it says, prompt for\nproject info for new projects.\n\n340\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.730\nAnd it basically says,\nif you're creating a new project,\n\n341\n00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.860\nthe first thing we should do is pop\nup that project information screen,\n\n342\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.590\nbecause that's where you need to go,\nright?\n\n343\n00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.665\nSo Microsoft knows this is\nsomething that's important enough.\n\n344\n00:17:01.665 --> 00:17:02.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n345\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.200\nthey don't check this by default so\nit's not there.\n\n346\n00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.520\nSo if you're worried about forgetting it,\n\n347\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.020\nthis is a great way to make it prompt\nanytime you create that new project.\n\n348\n00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.860\nWe wanna set it because if we change\nthings like, whether we're scheduling from\n\n349\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.270\na start date or scheduling from\na finish date, that's a big change.\n\n350\n00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.655\nAnd it can really alter the way\nyour project functions.\n\n351\n00:17:18.655 --> 00:17:21.470\nIt can cause some problems if\nyou change it after the fact.\n\n352\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.740\nBetter to change it early.\n\n353\n00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.040\nAll right, well Ronnie, this is a pretty\ngood spot for us to wrap this one up.\n\n354\n00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.520\nDo you have anything\nelse you wanna throw in?\n\n355\n00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.940\n>> We have one more thing that we need\nto throw in here at the very end.\n\n356\n00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.950\nThis is actually a great one cuz\nit talks about summarizing things.\n\n357\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:38.840\nAnd we wanna actually be able to put the\nname of our project right here at the top.\n\n358\n00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.500\nNow, I could go ahead and\njust insert in a new task and\n\n359\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.680\nthen just type in the name that\nI want the project to be, but\n\n360\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.850\nProject has a way of actually\nallowing us to do that.\n\n361\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.070\nIt's kind of a neat option that we have.\n\n362\n00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.260\nAnd the way that it keys it,\nis normally off of the file name as well,\n\n363\n00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.070\nif you don't have one set.\n\n364\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:03.131\nSo the way that you do that,\nlet me make sure I actually remember this,\n\n365\n00:18:03.131 --> 00:18:08.370\nis if I go to task,\nthere is field and formats.\n\n366\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.440\nYou know, of all the things I can't\nremember, it's always under formatting.\n\n367\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.740\nIf I select format, and it's over here\nat the end where it says show hide.\n\n368\n00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.640\nSo, notice that we have this little\nbox that's actually not checked here,\n\n369\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.610\nsays project summary task.\n\n370\n00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:27.380\nIf I select that, you'll see that it\nadded in a project summary task right up\n\n371\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.250\nhere at the very top for us.\n\n372\n00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.730\nSo, I didn't have to go and\nname what this project was.\n\n373\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.940\nI could have manually done this and\n\n374\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.880\nit automatically sets it as\nthis auto scheduled task.\n\n375\n00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.060\nAnd what that will actually allow us to\ndo, as we start entering in duration and\n\n376\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.630\nstart and finish dates here,\n\n377\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.360\nwe'll actually see that these numbers\nwill go ahead and start accumulating.\n\n378\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.840\nWe'll actually be able to see it here.\n\n379\n00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.900\nThen later on we'll actually be\nable to roll up all those tasks and\n\n380\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.580\nessentially shrink it down to\nthat one line if we need to,.\n\n381\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.610\nKind of neat.\n\n382\n00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.440\n>> Yeah, that's happening automatically so\n\n383\n00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.930\nit's a great way to see what the full\nduration of your project is.\n\n384\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.650\nSo for example, Ronnie, throw like a ten\nday duration on one of your activities.\n\n385\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.050\nAnd you'll see the roll up right now,\n\n386\n00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.170\nit goes from August 17th to August 17th,\ncuz everything's a one day activity.\n\n387\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.500\nBut now that he's added ten days see\nhow the start date is August 17th and\n\n388\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.540\nthe finish date is August 20th?\n\n389\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.420\nSo it knows,\nhey this is a ten day project now.\n\n390\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.650\nAnd so as our project gets more and more\ncomplex, this roll up task lets us see\n\n391\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.280\none big time line for the whole\nproject and that can be pretty handy.\n\n392\n00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.250\nIt is off by default.\n\n393\n00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.560\nWhen you turn it on,\nit gives you the name of the file.\n\n394\n00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.610\nYou can rename that.\n\n395\n00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.453\nSo, I'll often do that, take file names,\nnot necessarily what we want.\n\n396\n00:19:35.453 --> 00:19:38.137\nSo we might rename that to be\nthe terminal server project.\n\n397\n00:19:38.137 --> 00:19:41.010\nAnd it stays being that rollup,\nand it's auto-calculating.\n\n398\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.360\nSo it's pretty neat to have that\nkind of functionality in there.\n\n399\n00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.135\nYup, so\nRonnie's just gonna rename that one.\n\n400\n00:19:47.135 --> 00:19:49.930\nAnd once that's in,\nit takes place, and there you go.\n\n401\n00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.200\nSo, nice to have, especially if you're\nmanaging more than one project at a time,\n\n402\n00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.740\nyou can quickly and easily identify that.\n\n403\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.710\n>> There we go.\n\n404\n00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.800\n>> Alright, well, that's about it for\nour initial setup options.\n\n405\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.400\nObviously, we still have a lot\nmore that we can do in Project, so\n\n406\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.060\nstay tuned,\nwe have those episodes coming up.\n\n407\n00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.040\nBut for now, signing off for\nIT Pro TV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n408\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.840\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n409\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.282\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n410\n00:20:11.282 --> 00:20:17.240\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.360\nWelcome back to another episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.350\nBack again with Mr.\nRonnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.440\n>> It is going well today,\n\n6\n00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.830\nfeeling good, ready to get started into\nMicrosoft Project today, so excited.\n\n7\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.720\n>> Well, today we're gonna be jumping\ninto the topic that's probably the most\n\n8\n00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.700\nanticipated, which is\ncreating tasks in project.\n\n9\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.810\nProject is 100% useless if you\ndon't put some tasks in there,\n\n10\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.390\nthat's what this is really all about.\n\n11\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.220\nNow, I do wanna mention one thing real\nquick is, if you are PMI certified or\n\n12\n00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.450\ntrained in the Project Management\nInstitutes of Methodology.\n\n13\n00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.300\nThey hate the word task,\n\n14\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.590\nthey just do not like it,\nthey like the word activity, right?\n\n15\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.730\nWell, inside a project,\nit kind of goes either way.\n\n16\n00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.530\nSo when we talk about a task or\nan activity,\n\n17\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.240\nit's something people need to do.\n\n18\n00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.322\nAnd we have a string of these things\nthat people need to do that lead to\n\n19\n00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:01.687\nthe project being finished.\n\n20\n00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:04.240\nSo it doesn't really matter if you\ncall them activities or tasks,\n\n21\n00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.250\nMicrosoft generally calls them tasks.\n\n22\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.010\nSo we need to get those created,\n\n23\n00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.340\notherwise we're not gonna be able to take\nadvantage of the project, right Ronnie?\n\n24\n00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.220\n>> That's true, when you talk about\nactivities or tasks, a lot of times you\n\n25\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.230\nalso use the term you're probably\nfamiliar with it more than I am.\n\n26\n00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.420\nThe term work package is also another\ngreat term that you also end up\n\n27\n00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.680\nputting out there.\n\n28\n00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.900\nBut once you do have in mind what you\nwant to start to be able to control and\n\n29\n00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.960\nmonitor, well, it's fairly simple.\n\n30\n00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.120\nYou can actually do it of course\na couple of different ways.\n\n31\n00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.890\nOne is by simply typing in tasks\ndirectly into the project.\n\n32\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.479\nSo I simply opened up a brand new\nproject that has nothing in it and\n\n33\n00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.480\nI can just go ahead and begin to go in and\ntype in information as I want to.\n\n34\n00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.280\nSo I'm gonna call it Task1, Task2, Task3.\n\n35\n00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.442\nOops, so much for Task3 being\nsomething that's easy for me to do.\n\n36\n00:01:53.442 --> 00:01:55.191\n[LAUGH]\n>> You've ruined everything.\n\n37\n00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:55.899\n>> I know.\n\n38\n00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.450\nIt's amazing how easily I can\nactually ruin something like that.\n\n39\n00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.740\nBut we can simply go ahead and just start\ntyping that in and from that point.\n\n40\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.150\nYou've now created three different work\npackages that you have available and\n\n41\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.680\nnow you're ready to add in some durations.\n\n42\n00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.320\nFrom that point if your project calendar\nis set up, it will start to go ahead and\n\n43\n00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.595\nput in those Start dates and even Finish\ndates as your duration actually shows up.\n\n44\n00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:22.875\nSo we're kind of done, Don, I don't see\nanything else we really need to do.\n\n45\n00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:24.840\n>> That's it,\nthis project is gonna finish itself.\n\n46\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.715\nThis is really kind of where we start\nwith the early planning stages,\n\n47\n00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.025\nmaybe even in the initiation stages,\nright?\n\n48\n00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:34.267\nWhere we say, all right, here's the\nproject we're gonna do, let's just try and\n\n49\n00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:36.507\ncome up with a list of all\nthe stuff that needs to get done.\n\n50\n00:02:36.507 --> 00:02:39.112\nIn the planning phase, a lot of people\nrefer to this as the work breakdown\n\n51\n00:02:39.112 --> 00:02:41.092\nstructure, we're trying to\nfigure out all the work.\n\n52\n00:02:41.092 --> 00:02:43.498\nBut this might not be directly\ntied to work packages,\n\n53\n00:02:43.498 --> 00:02:46.030\nit might just be activities\nthat need to happen.\n\n54\n00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.630\nSo we start laying it out, and\n\n55\n00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.330\nyou might do exactly like Ronnie did,\nlet's just do the names first, all right?\n\n56\n00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.010\nAfter we got all of the names in place,\n\n57\n00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.060\nthen we start thinking about the order,\nright?\n\n58\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.825\nWhich order these are gonna\nhave to get done in.\n\n59\n00:02:56.825 --> 00:02:59.190\nBecause we might be thinking of\nthe tasks that have to get done and\n\n60\n00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.070\nnot necessarily how they\nrelate to each other.\n\n61\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.310\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nrelationships in another episode.\n\n62\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.762\nProject relationships, not personal ones,\nthat would be a fun episode.\n\n63\n00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:11.120\n[LAUGH] So we'll break it down there and\nkind of have tackle that.\n\n64\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.630\nBut even within these,\nas we start to create the activities,\n\n65\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.070\nwe need to be thinking about other\nthings like their duration, right?\n\n66\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.740\nHow long is it gonna take?\n\n67\n00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.990\nWho are the people or\nwhat people do I need?\n\n68\n00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.040\nWhat equipment do I need to\ncomplete these activities?\n\n69\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.440\nThere's a lot of other information.\n\n70\n00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.190\nBut just starting right here,\nthis is where we kind of start our plan.\n\n71\n00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.330\nJust throw them in there,\nget them in place and\n\n72\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.440\nthen we'll add more\ndetails as we get them.\n\n73\n00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.760\n>> Yeah, it's amazing that we can just\ndo something just as simple as this and\n\n74\n00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.810\nget started.\n\n75\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.120\nA lot of times, we actually can do\na little bit more if you actually have\n\n76\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.865\na little bit more information in there,\nso here's one that I imported then.\n\n77\n00:03:44.865 --> 00:03:48.416\nSo instead of me typing all this out,\nI just used an Excel spreadsheet and\n\n78\n00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:51.060\nI imported all of these tasks in here.\n\n79\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.180\nSo that we could work with\nit a little bit more.\n\n80\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.741\nSo once we have our tasks created,\nwe may go ahead and\n\n81\n00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:59.660\nstart breaking this down into what we\ncall that different types of activities.\n\n82\n00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.753\nAnd you see where it says installing,\nand then testing.\n\n83\n00:04:02.753 --> 00:04:06.475\nAnd the thing that project really\nwants you to feel comfortable with is,\n\n84\n00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:09.530\ndon't try and\norder it out right at the beginning.\n\n85\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.260\nIn other words, if you don't\nwanna use anything like Excel,\n\n86\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.500\nyou don't wanna put anything in order.\n\n87\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.320\nJust start typing it in, because later on,\n\n88\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.810\nyou actually have the ability rearrange\nthese task directly inside of project.\n\n89\n00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.480\nAnd that's where we want\nto take a look at as well,\n\n90\n00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.860\nso you can see that right now that what\nI have are actually some different ones.\n\n91\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.620\nWe're talking about Deploying Phase and\nyou can see down here, Testing Phase.\n\n92\n00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.382\nAnd then I actually have one that's\ncalled Tuning phase or optimization, but\n\n93\n00:04:36.382 --> 00:04:38.775\nthey're not exactly in the right order.\n\n94\n00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:40.355\nSo I just started typing.\n\n95\n00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:42.935\nAnd the first thing that I\nthought about when I did is,\n\n96\n00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:44.105\nwhat actually needs to be in place.\n\n97\n00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:46.925\nSo I typed in all the deployment\nstuff that I could think about.\n\n98\n00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:50.330\nBut then I realized that before we\ndeploy it, we wanted to test it.\n\n99\n00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.500\nAnd then at the end of course,\nonce we get everything set up,\n\n100\n00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.050\nI wanna make sure everything's optimized\nto work the way that it's supposed to be.\n\n101\n00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.130\nBut notice that they're all out of order.\n\n102\n00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.310\nWell, it doesn't really matter.\n\n103\n00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.970\nProject says, don't worry about it,\nnothing's actually kind of created yet, so\n\n104\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.230\nwe can actually move these things around.\n\n105\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.794\nMoving them around is fairly simple when\nnothing is actually connected in those\n\n106\n00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:10.990\nrelationships.\n\n107\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.300\nNow, once we get to that point when we\ntalk about them actually being related,\n\n108\n00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.710\nwe start moving them around.\n\n109\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.630\nWe may find out,\nit may cause more havoc than we think.\n\n110\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.440\nBut right now it's fairly simple.\n\n111\n00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.070\nSo if I wanted to take a single task here.\n\n112\n00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.670\nI can simply right-click and\n\n113\n00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.480\nI can cut that task out if I want to,\njust like we do cut, copy and paste.\n\n114\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.360\nSo we can do that and then I can\nselect the first task up here and\n\n115\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.046\nthen I can just paste it in.\n\n116\n00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:36.590\nAnd notice that is,\n\n117\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.560\nit really is just that simple if I\nneeded to do something like that.\n\n118\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.490\nAnd then I can logically start putting\nthem in the order that I want to.\n\n119\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.710\nNow what if I have more\nthan one task as well?\n\n120\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.630\nSo all those other things that I\nhad in that Testing Phase here.\n\n121\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.790\nSo what if I actually needed\nthese other task to also go?\n\n122\n00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.438\nI can do the same thing, well,\nI'm gonna select my other task and\n\n123\n00:05:58.438 --> 00:05:59.895\nI'm gonna get my four point arrow.\n\n124\n00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:02.032\nAnd that will allow me to\nselect the whole thing.\n\n125\n00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:06.987\nAnd then notice I can actually drag and\ntry and move it all the way up here, and\n\n126\n00:06:06.987 --> 00:06:08.570\nthen I can let go.\n\n127\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.500\nAnd when I did that, you actually\nsee something else happened here.\n\n128\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.740\nSo you can see where it\nactually left this blank.\n\n129\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.820\nAnd it also looks like it overwrote some\nof these other tasks that I had available.\n\n130\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.260\nAnd the reason why it actually did\nthat is because I only moved that\n\n131\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.705\ntask name itself.\n\n132\n00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:28.660\nWhereas before I actually select\nthe entire row and actually moved it up.\n\n133\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.370\nWell, the problem is,\nI actually did it wrong here.\n\n134\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.160\nSo what we can do since we have\nthe ability to use our Undo,\n\n135\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.740\nI can select Undo.\n\n136\n00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.790\nAnd then, instead of I wanted to move\nall of these tasks all the way up.\n\n137\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.920\nI'm not just going to move that box,\nI need to select the entire row.\n\n138\n00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.990\nAnd you can see now where it actually\nselects all of those rows and\n\n139\n00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.820\nnow all the way across and\nfrom this point.\n\n140\n00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.740\nIf I now click and drag it up,\nand I put it in between one and\n\n141\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.970\ntwo and you can see that gray line.\n\n142\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.050\nI now will actually be able to\ninsert that right in between, and\n\n143\n00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.910\nnow notice there is no gap in the middle.\n\n144\n00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.910\nAnd so\nwe can actually do it in that way as well.\n\n145\n00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.820\nAnd it actually allows us to be\nable to manipulate this too,\n\n146\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.550\nand be able to move those\ntasks where we need to.\n\n147\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.390\nSo even if you're not sure at the\nbeginning and you're using this as part of\n\n148\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.950\nyour planning,\nyou just need to enter the task in.\n\n149\n00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.300\nLater on now,\nyou can actually click individual ones or\n\n150\n00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.670\nyou can group them all together.\n\n151\n00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.530\nYou can actually move\ngroups of them as well.\n\n152\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.690\n>> Yeah, just be really careful, right?\n\n153\n00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.320\nMake a habit of selecting tasks by\nclicking on their numbers on the left side\n\n154\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.130\nof the screen.\n\n155\n00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.785\nAnd if you ever do a copy or a move and\nyou see those white tasks appear.\n\n156\n00:07:37.785 --> 00:07:41.219\nThen that's a great indicator that hey,\nyou didn't select things right,\n\n157\n00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:43.160\nyou didn't actually move the whole task.\n\n158\n00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.860\nSo, definitely something\nto keep an eye out for.\n\n159\n00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.328\nAnother common mistake,\n\n160\n00:07:48.328 --> 00:07:52.342\nmost people assume that the task list\nhas to be in chronological order.\n\n161\n00:07:52.342 --> 00:07:56.129\nBut we'll see later on when we get\ninto the relationship section,\n\n162\n00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:59.794\nwhere you might have more than one\ntask going on at the same time.\n\n163\n00:07:59.794 --> 00:08:01.411\nSo we might have some kind of testing and\n\n164\n00:08:01.411 --> 00:08:03.672\ndevelopment phase are all\nhappening at the same time.\n\n165\n00:08:03.672 --> 00:08:06.896\nAnd there's no good way to make that\nall chronological right there in your\n\n166\n00:08:06.896 --> 00:08:07.419\ntask list.\n\n167\n00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:11.140\nSo, in a very small project\nthese might be in order by date.\n\n168\n00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.050\nBut on large projects it's\nnormally all over the place.\n\n169\n00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.170\nSo, don't feel like you've got\nto put this in order by date.\n\n170\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.220\nPut it in order by the type of\nactivity that's happening or\n\n171\n00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.460\nthe people that are working on those\nactivities or who's responsible.\n\n172\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.440\nDivide up into something that's\na little bit more of a logical order.\n\n173\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.750\nNow often times that means that I'm\ngonna have tasks that are kinda\n\n174\n00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.680\ntreated as a whole.\n\n175\n00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.700\nMaybe even like a sub project almost.\n\n176\n00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.570\nAnd so\nI might want to group them together.\n\n177\n00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.210\nAnd Ron, there is a really good\nway to do that, isn't there?\n\n178\n00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.960\n>> There's a couple of\ndifferent ways we can do that.\n\n179\n00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.040\nOn my project plan I went ahead and\n\n180\n00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.730\nseparated out what I thought would really\nbe three separate little projects.\n\n181\n00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.550\nBut I thought overall,\n\n182\n00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.870\nthey actually went together as the one big\nproject that we were trying to accomplish.\n\n183\n00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.950\nSo you see I named one Testing Phase and\nDeploying Phase.\n\n184\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.310\nAnd then later on down here, I put\nTuning Phase down here in the very end.\n\n185\n00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.190\nNow at this point, everything is\nactually treated as an equal task.\n\n186\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.610\nBut what we can create are what\nwe call summary tasks.\n\n187\n00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.480\nAnd that will then go ahead and\n\n188\n00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.810\nallow us to take certain of these other\ntasks here and roll them up into one.\n\n189\n00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.270\nNow the easiest way to do that, and\nwe can do it one at a time of course,\n\n190\n00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.360\nwe can do a group of them, but let me\njust select task number two, for example.\n\n191\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.910\nIf I select task number two,\nInstalling and\n\n192\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.800\nConfiguring Server 2008 here,\nI can then indent that.\n\n193\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.550\nAnd when I do that, you actually watched\na change up here in task number one.\n\n194\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.980\nSo if I select Task, and\nthen inside of the schedule grouping,\n\n195\n00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.760\nnotice that I have this indent and the\nshort cuts, if you love those short cuts.\n\n196\n00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.580\nIt's Alt+Shift and the right arrow.\n\n197\n00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.150\nI always forget those shortcuts.\n\n198\n00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.080\nI always look for the little icon up here.\n\n199\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.830\nIf I select that, notice now it\nwent ahead and made an indent and\n\n200\n00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:54.770\nyou can see now that for task number one,\nit has now turned into a summary task.\n\n201\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.060\nAnd we can see it visually on\nthe Gantt chart by looking at it.\n\n202\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.000\nIt looks like a staple, Don,\nthis one actually looks like, in 2013.\n\n203\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.261\nIn previous editions of the project,\nit looked like vampire fangs,\n\n204\n00:10:05.261 --> 00:10:08.204\nI guess would be the easiest\nway to describe it.\n\n205\n00:10:08.204 --> 00:10:12.990\nBut you actually see where it's now being\na summary task to be able to do that.\n\n206\n00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:19.150\nAnd so anything that actually put under\nhere it will also roll those up as well.\n\n207\n00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.190\nSo I can go ahead and,\nI have to be careful, let me go ahead and\n\n208\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.350\nselect these next few tasks here.\n\n209\n00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.800\nAnd notice I can do the same thing and\ninsert those as well.\n\n210\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.300\nAnd now anything is actually, or\n\n211\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.060\nall of the different durations in time,\nit's going to get rolled up in here.\n\n212\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.050\nSo for\nexample if I say that this is going, for\n\n213\n00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.620\nexample installing it's\ngonna take two days.\n\n214\n00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.870\nAnd then the installing the thin client,\nlet's say that that takes a day.\n\n215\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.840\nIt's actually happening at the same time,\nand\n\n216\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.680\nyou can see where the beginning of it is.\n\n217\n00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.155\nAnd so it's all just rolling up under\nthere to give us that nice little summary\n\n218\n00:10:52.155 --> 00:10:52.900\ntask.\n\n219\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.570\n>> And there's two cool\nadvantages to this, right?\n\n220\n00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.310\nOne is the rollup,\n\n221\n00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.380\nI can see that my testing phase as it is\nright now is gonna take two days, right?\n\n222\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.121\nSo that's a great way to see that.\n\n223\n00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:05.250\nThe second advantage is you can\ncollapse the nested elements, right?\n\n224\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.410\nSo to the left of the testing page\nyou'll see that little triangle and\n\n225\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.800\nif you click it, it'll collapse that down.\n\n226\n00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.030\nSo on a massive project you can get\na little bit of screen overload, right.\n\n227\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.270\nIf you have thousands of tasks,\nyou don't wanna look at them all at once.\n\n228\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.170\nYou can collapse them down and\njust see the elements that you want.\n\n229\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.140\nIf you're just working\nin the testing phase,\n\n230\n00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.770\nyou might collapse all your other phases\nand just look at the testing phase task.\n\n231\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.520\nThat's kind of a nice function there.\n\n232\n00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.060\nYou still have the roll ups for\nthe ones that are collapsed,\n\n233\n00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.450\nyou just don't see the individual\ntasks and activities underneath it.\n\n234\n00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.870\n>> So, very quickly,\nhere's what Don's talking about.\n\n235\n00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.120\nRight, it looks like it's only 3 lines of\ntasks, but if you notice the numbers over\n\n236\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.740\nhere 1, 7 and 19, and\nnow if I want to only be focusing in on\n\n237\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.200\nthe testing phase I can expand those\nout and actually focus in on that.\n\n238\n00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.110\nIf I want to just focus in on the\ndeploying phase, we can do that as well.\n\n239\n00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.750\nAnd then of course the tuning.\n\n240\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.320\nSo it gives us that ability to be able\nto use those summary tasks and roll them\n\n241\n00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.870\nup together and continue to be able to\ndo all the stuff that we need to do.\n\n242\n00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.640\nWe're just getting our project ready for\nall the other things to come.\n\n243\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.130\n>> Now, once we've got that kind of set\nup, you can still move them as a whole.\n\n244\n00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.660\nIf you grab the roll up task and\nmove them around you can do that,\n\n245\n00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.760\nyou can throw them around.\n\n246\n00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.480\nYou generally do kind\nof treat them as whole.\n\n247\n00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.520\nYou can move the tasks around inside\nof the roll up and change their order.\n\n248\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.010\nThat's not necessarily\nset in stone either.\n\n249\n00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.450\nSo you do have a lot of flexibility there.\n\n250\n00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.079\nAnd this is all a part of building\nup that structure of the project.\n\n251\n00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:33.505\nAll right, Ronnie,\nwhat's next on our agenda?\n\n252\n00:12:33.505 --> 00:12:36.230\n>> Gonna talk about setting milestones,\ntoo.\n\n253\n00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.930\nSo when we talk about\nsetting up a milestone,\n\n254\n00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.470\nit's actually fairly easy to do\ninside of Microsoft Project.\n\n255\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.680\nBut, Don, what's the importance\nof setting up milestones?\n\n256\n00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.280\n>> All right.\nSo, we're gonna see whether\n\n257\n00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.020\ncertain activities that we create\nthat aren't actual activities,\n\n258\n00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.730\nit's not somebody has do to something,\nit's just marking a point in time.\n\n259\n00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.340\nSo like that rollup task where it\nmarks kind of the beginning and\n\n260\n00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.550\nend of that activity,\n\n261\n00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:01.110\nwe might have milestones that are dates\nset by our customer that we intend to hit.\n\n262\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.002\nSo maybe we have an intended date for\n\n263\n00:13:03.002 --> 00:13:07.150\nthe testing phase that we want\nit to be done by August 31st.\n\n264\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.070\nSo I might wanna create a milestone for\nAugust 31st.\n\n265\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.700\nI'm not saying there's work that\nneeds to be done on August 31st.\n\n266\n00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.940\nI'm saying we should be\ndone by August 31st.\n\n267\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.560\nSo we might want to create an activity\nright there at the end of the testing\n\n268\n00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.640\nphase that says something\nlike testing phase complete.\n\n269\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.410\nRight?\n\n270\n00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:27.270\nAnd I want that to be set for August 31st,\nbut I don't want it to be work.\n\n271\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.700\nSo, how do we identify that?\n\n272\n00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.100\nWe identify it by setting\na duration of zero days.\n\n273\n00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.120\nIf you have a duration of zero,\nthe project will make it a milestone.\n\n274\n00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.560\nAnd it's just a marker we can use for\nour own tracking purposes, and\n\n275\n00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.512\nwe'll see that later in\nthe reporting shows.\n\n276\n00:13:41.512 --> 00:13:44.853\nIf we're like, well, are we behind\nschedule, are we ahead of schedule,\n\n277\n00:13:44.853 --> 00:13:47.413\ndid we meet our milestone, or\ndid we miss our milestone.\n\n278\n00:13:47.413 --> 00:13:50.150\nAnd we'll be able to see that\nbecause we got that entry.\n\n279\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:54.480\nSo Ronnie just created that testing phase\ncomplete, he gave it a zero duration, and\n\n280\n00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.550\nlook what happened over\nin the Gantt chart.\n\n281\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.700\nIt changed into a diamond.\n\n282\n00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.710\nThat little diamond is the way that\nMicrosoft Project represents a milestone.\n\n283\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.900\nAnd now we know this isn't actual work,\nthis is a target.\n\n284\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.910\nThis is something that we\nneed to finish this by.\n\n285\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.700\nThe testing phase should\nbe done on August 31st.\n\n286\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.260\nAnd if we're still working on\nactivities past August 31st, we can\n\n287\n00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.860\nvisually see that, the activities are\nextending beyond where that milestone is.\n\n288\n00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:24.121\n>> I forgot to set the date is what\nI forgot, but that's what happened.\n\n289\n00:14:24.121 --> 00:14:25.955\nNow, Don, this is kind of interesting.\n\n290\n00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:29.025\nI know it's not exactly where we are but\nwhen I did that, Don,\n\n291\n00:14:29.025 --> 00:14:31.335\nthe diamond disappeared.\n\n292\n00:14:31.335 --> 00:14:33.475\nAnd so, what's going on there, Don?\n\n293\n00:14:33.475 --> 00:14:36.635\n>> Yeah, remember that the Gantt chart is\nbeing rendered based on your calendar and\n\n294\n00:14:36.635 --> 00:14:39.107\nso you're looking at July 12th or\nJuly 14th,\n\n295\n00:14:39.107 --> 00:14:42.517\nbecause that's what today is,\nso, is based on that.\n\n296\n00:14:42.517 --> 00:14:45.527\nThe milestone, you can set all the way out\nto August 31st, so it's off the screen,\n\n297\n00:14:45.527 --> 00:14:46.887\nand you could scroll over and find it,\n\n298\n00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:51.153\nas you just did, or\nyou can hit the good old Ctrl+Shift+F5.\n\n299\n00:14:51.153 --> 00:14:54.700\nCtrl+Shift+F5 is the one shortcut\nthat I always remember because\n\n300\n00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.010\nI use the heck out of it.\n\n301\n00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.650\nAnd that's the scroll to task shortcut.\n\n302\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.300\nIt says move the Gantt chart,\nor move the calendar,\n\n303\n00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.180\nmove whatever it is you're viewing to\nwherever this particular activity happens.\n\n304\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.900\nBecause remember, your activity list is\nnot necessarily in chronological order, so\n\n305\n00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.020\nthe Gantt chart on the right side is\noftentimes looking at the wrong dates.\n\n306\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.400\nIt's just pretty common.\n\n307\n00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.540\nWhen you launch project,\nit's showing you today.\n\n308\n00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.915\nYou might wanna be seeing something\nin the future, like this milestone.\n\n309\n00:15:18.915 --> 00:15:21.680\nCtrl+Shift+F5 will jump you right there.\n\n310\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.404\n>> And if you don't like using shortcuts\nor you can't remember them like I can't,\n\n311\n00:15:25.404 --> 00:15:28.799\nup here as you're selecting on task\nover here in the Editing group you also\n\n312\n00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:30.246\nhave that option right there.\n\n313\n00:15:30.246 --> 00:15:34.690\nAnd of course it also shows you in\nparentheses that shortcut key as well.\n\n314\n00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.030\nThat's scroll to task has actually\nhas been a saving grace at times,\n\n315\n00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.540\nespecially when you\nhave a lot of tasks and\n\n316\n00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.275\nall the information's actually in there,\nand you can't see it in the Gantt chart.\n\n317\n00:15:44.275 --> 00:15:48.065\nSelect that task and then use that\nscroll to task or use that shortcut, and\n\n318\n00:15:48.065 --> 00:15:51.275\nthat will bring you right there in\nthe Gantt chart so that you can see it.\n\n319\n00:15:51.275 --> 00:15:54.139\nA very nice little handy tool\nto make available to us.\n\n320\n00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:55.721\n>> Yeah.\n\n321\n00:15:55.721 --> 00:16:00.217\nNow, what Ronnie just did when he created\nthat milestone is, he put a date in there.\n\n322\n00:16:00.217 --> 00:16:03.629\nAnd what that's called is\nmanually scheduling the task.\n\n323\n00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:07.690\nHe manually said the task is going\nto happen on that day, right?\n\n324\n00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.600\nBut we don't always have that.\n\n325\n00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.280\nYou can have what are called\nauto-scheduled tasks.\n\n326\n00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.250\nAnd that's where you create the task and\n\n327\n00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.530\nProject will move it around based on\nthe relationships that we create.\n\n328\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.590\nNow we're gonna see more of that\nin the relationship episode.\n\n329\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.380\nSo I don't wanna dive into that too much.\n\n330\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.340\nBut you'll notice at the bottom of\nRonnie's screen where it says new tasks\n\n331\n00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.660\nare manually scheduled,\nthat's the default for Project.\n\n332\n00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.070\nAnd that means it's gonna create\nit on today's date by default and\n\n333\n00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.500\nthen you manually choose which\nday you want it to occur on.\n\n334\n00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.490\nSo he chose for the milestone August 31st,\nyou can set it for\n\n335\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.590\nwhatever date he wanted.\n\n336\n00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.550\nJust manually setting that and\ngetting it in place.\n\n337\n00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.920\n>> Yeah, so there's options for\nyou to be able to do that.\n\n338\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.020\nAnd all those are actually\nlocated up here under Task, and\n\n339\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.720\nyou can manually schedule or\nauto schedule.\n\n340\n00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.620\nAnd you'll see that you\njust choose from it, and\n\n341\n00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.300\nthere's a visual indicator in\nthe second column on mine.\n\n342\n00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.990\nOops, let me get out of the way.\n\n343\n00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:59.700\nOn the plan here, on the Gantt chart plan,\nwhere you can see on this entry table.\n\n344\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.810\nIf you see the little blue bar with the\narrow, it tells you it's auto scheduled.\n\n345\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.540\nIf you see where it's actually got\na little thumb tack or a question mark or\n\n346\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.670\njust a thumb tack itself,\nthat means you're manually gonna put in\n\n347\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.020\nthe information that you need\nto into the project plan itself.\n\n348\n00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.230\nSo a lot of times on those milestones,\nthat's what you do.\n\n349\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.241\nYou actually set them in, and that way\nyou know what goal you're gonna meet.\n\n350\n00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:22.584\nAnd you might do that for each one\nof these phases setting up what our\n\n351\n00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:26.524\nmilestones are going to be to help us to\nactually know when we're supposed to be\n\n352\n00:17:26.524 --> 00:17:29.110\ndone with that where it may\neven be a decision time.\n\n353\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.690\nLike if we didn't get it done by\nthis point we're not gonna go ahead\n\n354\n00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.580\nwith the future.\n\n355\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.280\nSo you can always set\nthose milestones as well.\n\n356\n00:17:35.612 --> 00:17:38.870\nAll right now, Ronnie, when we create\nan activity list like this these\n\n357\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.290\nare typically things that we need\nto do kind of workwise or whatever.\n\n358\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.300\nYou start nesting them\ninto these projects,\n\n359\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.910\ninto these like sub-projects or\njust rollup tasks.\n\n360\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.880\nIt's really starting to\ncreate kind of a tiered list,\n\n361\n00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.160\nand you can have multiple\nlevels like Ronnie.\n\n362\n00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.074\nYou have one level of nesting there,\n\n363\n00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:57.595\nbut you could take something like\ntesting with Windows Thin PC, and\n\n364\n00:17:57.595 --> 00:18:01.824\nyou could indent that one more time,\nand now you've got, like, nested tasks.\n\n365\n00:18:01.824 --> 00:18:05.680\nAnd you can go several levels deep I think\nit's, is it nine levels is the maximum?\n\n366\n00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.540\n>> I think so.\n\n367\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.830\nIt may even be more for now.\n\n368\n00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.040\nI don't know.\nIt's a lot.\n\n369\n00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.880\n>> It's pretty deep.\n\n370\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.030\nDefinitely for sure there so\nyou can continue to nest that.\n\n371\n00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:17.960\nWell, if you wanna refer to one of\nthose tasks cuz it's like super nested.\n\n372\n00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.320\nYou can say well, it's task ID 17, and\n\n373\n00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.310\nsomebody in Microsoft Project, they're\ngonna see those numbers on the left side.\n\n374\n00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.840\nThey can find Task ID 17, and there it is.\n\n375\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.740\nBut you might want to refer to them by\nmore of an outline number type format,\n\n376\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.820\nwhere it is 1.3.1.\n\n377\n00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.080\nOne, I have to go find task ID one,\nand under it dot three.\n\n378\n00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.240\nI need to find the third sub-task\nunder it, and then dot one,\n\n379\n00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.075\nthat would be the first sub-task under the\nthird sub-task under the main one, right?\n\n380\n00:18:43.075 --> 00:18:44.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It gets kind of confusing.\n\n381\n00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.240\nWell fortunately Project has support for\nthat where it can show you an alternate\n\n382\n00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.657\nnumbering scheme that's\nmore of an outline format.\n\n383\n00:18:50.657 --> 00:18:54.340\n>> You know, the way to shore\nthat up is actually really easy.\n\n384\n00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.422\nIn the past,\nyou would have brought up another column,\n\n385\n00:18:56.422 --> 00:18:59.567\nand you would have chosen something like\nwork breakdown, and you can still do that,\n\n386\n00:18:59.567 --> 00:19:02.073\nthose numbers are still there and\nyou can even create custom ones.\n\n387\n00:19:02.073 --> 00:19:06.155\nBut if you wanna use what's default\nset there inside of Microsoft Project,\n\n388\n00:19:06.155 --> 00:19:08.470\nit's fairly simple for\nus to be able to do.\n\n389\n00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:13.950\nOn our project plan, once we have that up,\nwhat we need to do is go to the Format tab\n\n390\n00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:18.540\nand inside of format and then over on the\nright-hand side where it says Show Hide,\n\n391\n00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.500\nnotice I have this check box\nthat says Outline Number.\n\n392\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.810\nAnd we're trying to keep our eye over here\non the left hand side at the same time.\n\n393\n00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.300\nI like seeing it happen.\n\n394\n00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.130\nI'm going to put a check mark there.\n\n395\n00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.197\nAnd notice that by default under\nTask Name, it went ahead and\n\n396\n00:19:32.197 --> 00:19:38.199\nset up a default outline numbering scheme,\nwhere you have 1 and then 1.1 and 1.2.\n\n397\n00:19:38.199 --> 00:19:42.630\nAnd now notice that\nthird layer in is 1.2.1.\n\n398\n00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.350\nAnd so we can continue to\nactually add in more information.\n\n399\n00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.920\nNow, if you want to go ahead and add in,\nlet's say this one, it doesn't make\n\n400\n00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.860\nlogical sense right now, but, if I wanted\nto also indent this one in, I can do that.\n\n401\n00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.260\nAnd notice the numbers\nautomatically change.\n\n402\n00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.900\nIf I want to take that out,\nI simply out dent it.\n\n403\n00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.840\nAnd notice it actually comes\nback to the regular numbers.\n\n404\n00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.150\nIt doesn't actually screw up anything or\n\n405\n00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.370\nmess up anything in\nthe rest of our plan here.\n\n406\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.180\nSo it's a nice easy way for you to now\nbe able to refer to this logically.\n\n407\n00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.000\nAs you might have printed this out for\nsomeone, somebody can say, hey,\n\n408\n00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.440\non task 1.2.1,\nhow are we doing with that that?\n\n409\n00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.020\nDid we actually get it installed?\n\n410\n00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.770\nIs it now being tested?\n\n411\n00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.050\nWhen we did that, and\nit's actually a nice way to do that.\n\n412\n00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:27.180\nNow notice that this actually did\nvisually also change up here too.\n\n413\n00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.650\nNot-\n>> Because it's become a roll up now.\n\n414\n00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:30.400\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Became a roll up, yeah.\n\n415\n00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.610\n>> All right, so Ronnie you talked about\nthe nice things about using the outline\n\n416\n00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.126\nnumbering, let me tell\nyou one of the negatives.\n\n417\n00:20:35.126 --> 00:20:36.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right?\n\n418\n00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.750\nOne of the negatives is that as\nyou start to insert new tasks,\n\n419\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.360\nthe numbers change, right?\n\n420\n00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.900\nSo I might have a task\nthat's 1.4 right now.\n\n421\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.710\nAnd if I add a task above it.\n\n422\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.575\nThat 1.4 just became 1.5.\n\n423\n00:20:48.575 --> 00:20:50.685\nSo if I send somebody an email and I say,\n\n424\n00:20:50.685 --> 00:20:52.585\nhey, somebody needs to pay\nsome attention to 1.4.\n\n425\n00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:55.205\nI'm worried about it falling behind.\n\n426\n00:20:55.205 --> 00:20:56.135\nA new task gets added.\n\n427\n00:20:56.135 --> 00:20:59.880\nIt becomes 1.5,\n1.4 is now referring to some other task.\n\n428\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.050\nAnd so that's not really an ideal\nsolution for us, that causes a problem.\n\n429\n00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.910\nNow in previous versions of Project I\n\n430\n00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:10.880\nwould always create my own custom\ndata field, and I would call it WBS.\n\n431\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.130\nI would assign a work breakdown\nstructure numbered to each one.\n\n432\n00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.190\nAnd by doing it that way,\nthose were permanent.\n\n433\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:20.090\nAnd if I added a new task,\nit didn't matter, 1.4 was always 1.4.\n\n434\n00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:25.200\nFor, if I added a task above it, it\nmight be 1.5, even though it's above it.\n\n435\n00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.710\nAnd that was just to make sure those\nnumbers always stayed the same.\n\n436\n00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.110\nNow, in Project 2013,\nMicrosoft introduced a hidden field,\n\n437\n00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:37.860\nor column we can add in, that's called\nWBS, and so there's temptation there,\n\n438\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.190\nlike, hey, I'll go in there and\nuse their WBS one!\n\n439\n00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.782\nBut it auto calculates too.\n\n440\n00:21:41.782 --> 00:21:45.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so it's somewhat pointless.\n\n441\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.110\nNow their WBS is just like outline except\nit's stored in separate column as opposed\n\n442\n00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.980\nto being attached to\nthe name like the outline.\n\n443\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.580\nBut they both auto calculate.\n\n444\n00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.160\nSo as you insert tasks those numbers\nchange and that can be a real problem.\n\n445\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.220\nSo again,\nyou might wanna use a custom data type.\n\n446\n00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.610\nYou know, grab one of those text or\nnumber fields.\n\n447\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.000\nI think there's actually an outline field,\nthat you can use.\n\n448\n00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.220\nAnd you can throw that in there and make\nsure that those numbers stay permanent.\n\n449\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.170\nSo, the outline view is great for\njust quick reference, it's not great for\n\n450\n00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.510\nactual static references to\nother people on your project.\n\n451\n00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.925\n>> There's also another neat feature\nthat we can also see what the task, and\n\n452\n00:22:17.925 --> 00:22:21.965\nprobably helps a little bit later on as\nthe project gets a little more developed,\n\n453\n00:22:21.965 --> 00:22:25.385\nbut is to set a task as being inactive.\n\n454\n00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:29.335\nNow in an earlier episode, Don kind of\njust briefly mentioned the idea of doing\n\n455\n00:22:29.335 --> 00:22:34.047\nwhat if scenarios to try and\nhelp out and that in previous additions,\n\n456\n00:22:34.047 --> 00:22:36.037\nwe might not have been able\nto do that very easier.\n\n457\n00:22:36.037 --> 00:22:41.227\nBut inside of Project itself now,\nwe have what we call an inactive field.\n\n458\n00:22:41.227 --> 00:22:45.517\nAnd if I select Task and under\nSchedule Group, here it says inactive.\n\n459\n00:22:45.517 --> 00:22:47.777\nIt says inactive task\nremain in the project but\n\n460\n00:22:47.777 --> 00:22:51.730\nno longer effect the schedule or\nresource availability.\n\n461\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.709\nSo if I wanted to test my project out and\ngo okay,\n\n462\n00:22:54.709 --> 00:22:59.866\nwhat happens if I just simply remove this\ntask here, and see what ends up going on.\n\n463\n00:22:59.866 --> 00:23:03.713\nI can now actually go ahead and\naffect it, and it actually takes it out,\n\n464\n00:23:03.713 --> 00:23:08.640\nand then I can actually see all right if I\nremove this task, what ends up happening.\n\n465\n00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.460\nAnd then you can actually just\nput it back, and you are ready\n\n466\n00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.030\nto be able to add everything back in and\nsee what affect it actually has.\n\n467\n00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.286\nSo it's a nice little very basic, kind of,\nwhat if thing, that if you want to.\n\n468\n00:23:19.286 --> 00:23:22.750\n>> Yeah, in what if scenarios in the past,\nit was kind of risky, cuz if you\n\n469\n00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.790\naccidentally saved, you would have deleted\nthe task, and that was a big deal.\n\n470\n00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:29.830\nBeing able to deactivate and reactivate\nthose tasks is pretty straightforward.\n\n471\n00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.940\nAnd using that button up\nthere in the ribbon bar,\n\n472\n00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.070\nthat's probably the best way to go about\nit, but you can double-click on the task\n\n473\n00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.770\ntoo, and there's just a little check\nbox in there that says inactive.\n\n474\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.520\nAnd so\nyou can check it off as being inactive or\n\n475\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.370\nuncheck it to make it active again.\n\n476\n00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.560\nIt's right up there under\nthe priority on the right side.\n\n477\n00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.640\nSo you can turn that on and\noff pretty quickly there.\n\n478\n00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.220\nMore than one way to do\nthe exact same thing, right?\n\n479\n00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.800\nThe button on the ribbon\nbar's probably the easiest.\n\n480\n00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:54.350\n>> Now the last thing that we have\nin our objective here is to set what\n\n481\n00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.674\nwe call a recurring task.\n\n482\n00:23:55.674 --> 00:23:59.717\nNow you may be wondering like I did what\nrecurring task would I actually have\n\n483\n00:23:59.717 --> 00:24:00.880\ninside of projects?\n\n484\n00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.880\nWell, the one that always gets me,\nof course are things like The status\n\n485\n00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.346\nmeetings, right,\nthat have to go on inside of projects.\n\n486\n00:24:06.346 --> 00:24:09.550\nAs much as I don't like meetings,\nI know that they're very important for\n\n487\n00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.512\nus to be able to set up\ninside of our project and\n\n488\n00:24:11.512 --> 00:24:14.768\nmake sure that they are a recurrence so\nthat we do get the updates that we need\n\n489\n00:24:14.768 --> 00:24:17.800\nthat we can enter the information\ninto our project plan.\n\n490\n00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.920\nSo, project goes ahead and adds that in so\n\n491\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.200\nthat we can have it as part\nof the project plan itself.\n\n492\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.743\nSo, if I wanted to set up\na recurring task within project,\n\n493\n00:24:28.743 --> 00:24:33.657\nwhat I do is I select Task and\nthen, under the Insert grouping,\n\n494\n00:24:33.657 --> 00:24:36.161\nnotice I have this Task option,\n\n495\n00:24:36.161 --> 00:24:41.207\nI can also select the down arrow and\nthen select Recurring Task.\n\n496\n00:24:41.207 --> 00:24:45.657\nAnd that will now actually allow me to\ncreate a recurring path that will happen\n\n497\n00:24:45.657 --> 00:24:47.582\nthroughout the project itself.\n\n498\n00:24:47.582 --> 00:24:54.456\nSo I can call this my\nProject Status Meeting, here.\n\n499\n00:24:54.456 --> 00:24:58.040\nAnd for the duration,\nof course once you set up a duration,\n\n500\n00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.492\nI'm just gonna type in 2H for 2 hours.\n\n501\n00:25:00.492 --> 00:25:04.913\nHopefully, of course, a meeting will never\ntake that long but you never know and\n\n502\n00:25:04.913 --> 00:25:07.700\nthen how often do we want this occurring.\n\n503\n00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.630\nSo do you need daily,\ndo you need weekly meetings,\n\n504\n00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.330\nmonthly, yearly meetings, whatever\nyou might actually want to set up.\n\n505\n00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:18.370\nSo I'm just gonna set up a weekly meeting\nto occur, let's say, on Tuesday, so\n\n506\n00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.910\nI can actually have it occur every week,\n\n507\n00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.610\nI can have it occur every\ntwo weeks if I need to.\n\n508\n00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.780\nBut I can go ahead and set that up.\n\n509\n00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.870\nAnd then I can set up a range of\nthe actual occurrences too and\n\n510\n00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:31.450\ntell it when to end by.\n\n511\n00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:36.155\nIf I know that my project is possibly\ngonna end by let's say December 31st,\n\n512\n00:25:37.531 --> 00:25:40.357\nAt least that's what I'm hoping for,\nI can go ahead and\n\n513\n00:25:40.357 --> 00:25:44.290\nselect that to actually have that\nrecurring status meeting in there.\n\n514\n00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:47.602\nEvery two hours, and then on the project\ncalendar, if I'd created one,\n\n515\n00:25:47.602 --> 00:25:49.920\nI would select that one, but\nI just have the standard calendar.\n\n516\n00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.950\nAnd then it says scheduling\nignores resource calendars.\n\n517\n00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.980\nNow, this is actually an important\nresource for us because,\n\n518\n00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.410\nremember that a resource calendar will\noverride the project's default calendar.\n\n519\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.290\nSo, if we are actually saying, look,\n\n520\n00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:07.250\nwe need the meeting to occur, regardless\nof what that resource says it can do.\n\n521\n00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.070\nWe might also wanna check that too, so\n\n522\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.500\nthat way it actually still goes ahead and\nhappens.\n\n523\n00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.577\nSo, I'm going to do that here.\n\n524\n00:26:15.577 --> 00:26:19.774\nAnd once I do that, noticed it added\nin all of those meetings right there at\n\n525\n00:26:19.774 --> 00:26:22.076\nthe project where I actually selected,\n\n526\n00:26:22.076 --> 00:26:24.601\nprobably not a great\npoint at where I put it.\n\n527\n00:26:24.601 --> 00:26:27.810\n[LAUGH] I should have actually selected\nwhere I wanted it to go first.\n\n528\n00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:30.789\n>> Well, you could move them\nwhich you might wanna do.\n\n529\n00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:34.320\nOr, you might wanna put them in their\nown subtask so you can collapse it and\n\n530\n00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.120\nyou're not be bugged with it all the time,\nbut they still show up in your calendar,\n\n531\n00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.360\nwhich is pretty handy.\n\n532\n00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.830\nOr if you're printing a to do list for\nsomebody it'll show up in there,\n\n533\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.640\nwhich is a pretty nice thing too.\n\n534\n00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.855\nAnd notice that it's not just\ncreating these tasks and\n\n535\n00:26:45.855 --> 00:26:47.975\njust throwing them out\nthere as individual tasks.\n\n536\n00:26:47.975 --> 00:26:51.485\nThey are still kind of\nassociated in a way.\n\n537\n00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:55.355\nSo, you'll see on the left side there\nhow it's got the little circle icon\n\n538\n00:26:55.355 --> 00:26:58.605\nin the status column, it's letting\nus know it is a recurring task.\n\n539\n00:26:58.605 --> 00:27:02.355\nSo, you can always go back and modify the\nwhole series as opposed to being forced to\n\n540\n00:27:02.355 --> 00:27:05.105\nedit each one individually,\nit's a pretty nice feature.\n\n541\n00:27:05.105 --> 00:27:07.600\n>> It really is and\nyou start seeing all these meetings.\n\n542\n00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.150\nSo we were to start having these project\nstatus meetings every week, it shows me,\n\n543\n00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.040\nit looks like I'm gonna have 25 different\nmeetings all the way to the end of\n\n544\n00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.500\nthe year, if my project goes that long.\n\n545\n00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.120\nMore than likely,\nit's not gonna go that long.\n\n546\n00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.340\n>> Hey, with that many meetings,\nyou're definitely guaranteed success,\n\n547\n00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.350\nright Ronnie?\n\n548\n00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.985\n>> Eh, no.\n\n549\n00:27:21.985 --> 00:27:24.520\n[LAUGH]\n>> I thought project success was measured\n\n550\n00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.460\nbased on how many meetings you have.\n\n551\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.060\n>> I think it's based on\nhow many meetings you have\n\n552\n00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.500\ntimes some other duration\nthat we might not know about.\n\n553\n00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.830\n>> Times quantity of synergy.\n\n554\n00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.250\n>> That's right synergy.\n\n555\n00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.880\n>> So it's.\n[LAUGH] All right so,\n\n556\n00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.700\nas far as getting tasks created,\nthere's some neat features in there, but\n\n557\n00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.160\nthe basic functions of getting a task\ncreated is super simple, right?\n\n558\n00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.770\nAnd we can indent them to\ncreate the nested tasks.\n\n559\n00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.880\nThat's usually step 1 for\ngetting tasks loaded in our project.\n\n560\n00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.640\nStep 2, it's setting up all\nthe relationships between the projects,\n\n561\n00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.120\nor between the activities, but\nthat's a much bigger task for us.\n\n562\n00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.150\nSo let's save that one for\nanother episode.\n\n563\n00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.070\nAs far as creating tasks, so Ronnie,\nyou have anything else you wanna throw in?\n\n564\n00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.770\n>> No, just remember, if you're not\nfamiliar with it, play with it.\n\n565\n00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.400\nThis is the way to get to learn it,\ncuz if not you're gonna go,\n\n566\n00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.830\nokay, I don't know what I'm\nsupposed to do with it.\n\n567\n00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.690\nSo, more often you're in it,\nthe better it's gonna be.\n\n568\n00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:13.600\n>> Absolutely.\n\n569\n00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.540\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n570\n00:28:16.540

Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.660\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.070\n>> It is going great.\n\n8\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.240\nExcited today, ready for\n\n9\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.992\nanother great time to take\na look at the Microsoft Project.\n\n10\n00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:29.510\nAll right well, today we're going to\nbe taking a very important part of\n\n11\n00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.390\nMicrosoft Project,\n\n12\n00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.580\nwhich is the relationships\nbetween the tasks that we make.\n\n13\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.940\nWhen you put tasks into\nproject by default,\n\n14\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.290\nevery task is it's own individual entity\ncompletely independent of everything else.\n\n15\n00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.530\nBut in real life,\nwe know it's not like that.\n\n16\n00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.000\nThere's a lot of things\nthat influence a task.\n\n17\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.050\nThey might influence when it can start,\n\n18\n00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.440\nwhen it can finish, might influence\nwho's available to work on them.\n\n19\n00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.190\nAnd these are all things that\nare called constraints, and\n\n20\n00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.510\nthere's a number of different\ntypes of constraints.\n\n21\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.040\nMicrosoft Project has\nthe bulk of them in there.\n\n22\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.180\nThe ones that people really deal with.\n\n23\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.220\nThey're all in there, we just need to\nknow what they are, how they work, and\n\n24\n00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.870\nkind of how they affect\nthe way that our tasks work.\n\n25\n00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.350\nSo Ronnie, where are we gonna start\non this, because there's so many?\n\n26\n00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.470\n>> Well a lot of times you have to just\nkind of logically remember what we've done\n\n27\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.590\nso far, right?\n\n28\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.570\nWe've just kind of added\nin tasks into Project.\n\n29\n00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.810\nIt's just like you opened up\nan Excel spreadsheet right now and\n\n30\n00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.330\nyou just started adding them in.\n\n31\n00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.000\nWe've seen a little bit of different\nthings that we can add in,\n\n32\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.970\nas far as properties and\nchanges to the individual task, but\n\n33\n00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.360\nright now it's really not doing anything.\n\n34\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.690\nSo, Project is really not showing\nus its full ability to do things.\n\n35\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.410\nWe start talking about\nadding in constraints,\n\n36\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.750\nnow we're gonna actually make\nproject do some of the things\n\n37\n00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.820\nthat it has to do to set our\nschedule on the right track.\n\n38\n00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.510\nSo one of the ways we can\ndo that is by taking a look\n\n39\n00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.030\nat some of the different constraints\nthat we can put in place on each and\n\n40\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.200\nevery individual task that\nwe have inside a project.\n\n41\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.010\nAnd by that, what do we mean?\n\n42\n00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.220\nWe mean setting the limitations of when\nthe project may be able to begin or\n\n43\n00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.820\nwhen it has to end as well.\n\n44\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.590\nAnd there's a range of different\nconstraints that are actually\n\n45\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.950\nin between that too.\n\n46\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.820\nSo let me show you an example\nof what I'm talking about.\n\n47\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.790\nHere on my computer, I went ahead and\n\n48\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.570\nopened up a Project plan\nthat we had already started.\n\n49\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.330\nBut I don't have anything actually there,\nit's just showing me a list of different\n\n50\n00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.580\ntasks that I have available, and if I want\nto set a constraint on these tasks, a lot\n\n51\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.010\nof times, it's fairly simple, but you\nhave to keep a couple of things in mind.\n\n52\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.710\nSo, I'm gonna select this 2.1 Installing\nand Configuring Server 2008 R2,\n\n53\n00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.900\nI'm gonna right-click, and\nI'm gonna go down to information.\n\n54\n00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.520\nAnd that should bring up my\nTask Information dialog box.\n\n55\n00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.120\nWhen I do that, what I'm looking for here,\n\n56\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.840\ninside of Task Information is\ngonna be under this Advanced tab.\n\n57\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.960\nNow when I take a look at it I can\njust see right away that it says hey,\n\n58\n00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.170\nI can set a deadline.\n\n59\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.540\nAnd that might be something I want to set.\n\n60\n00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.300\nBut what I'm really trying to get to is\nwhere it says right here, constraint type.\n\n61\n00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.380\nAnd Don right away,\nI look at it and it's grayed out.\n\n62\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.730\nIt looks like, okay.\n\n63\n00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.560\nSo as soon as possible looks like\nthe only option that I have, but\n\n64\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.010\nit really isn't the only\noption that we have.\n\n65\n00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.920\nBut only by working with Microsoft Project\ndo you understand what's going on.\n\n66\n00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.470\nAnd why you can't get\nto this right here too.\n\n67\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.950\nSo next we can set a constraint type and\na constraint date but it's not letting me\n\n68\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.910\ndo it and believe it or not, all of my\ntasks are actually going to be that way.\n\n69\n00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.770\nIf I select another one,\njust to show you a quick example here, and\n\n70\n00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.320\nI go on down through the list\nyou'll see the same thing.\n\n71\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.060\nAnd the reason why that's happening,\nis because Microsoft or the Project,\n\n72\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.010\nthe way that I have it set up right now.\n\n73\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.188\nIt is saying Ronnie you said that\nyou wanna control everything.\n\n74\n00:03:36.188 --> 00:03:40.140\nOkay, so you're gonna manually set\nall of these things into place,\n\n75\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.690\nso that means I'm not gonna worry about\nconstraints because you're gonna actually\n\n76\n00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.780\ntype in everything that you need to do.\n\n77\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.120\nIt's over here under this second column\nthat says Task Mode that I actually have\n\n78\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.890\nto change something, cuz everything right\nnow that I have is actually manually set.\n\n79\n00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.990\nIf I click on that for line 22,\nnotice it says Manually Scheduled.\n\n80\n00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.760\nThat's means I'm gonna control everything.\n\n81\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.250\nBut what I want to do is I wanna\nlet projects start to help me out.\n\n82\n00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.400\nSo I change that task type\nto Auto Scheduled, and\n\n83\n00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.870\nwhen I do that we see the icon change.\n\n84\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.590\nAnd then if I right click on that task and\nI go to task information, and\n\n85\n00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.050\nonce my Task Information dialog box comes\nback up, I click on this Advanced tab.\n\n86\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.360\nNow notice that I have options\nto not only set a Deadline,\n\n87\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.160\nthe Constraint type as well as\nthe date that I also have ready to go.\n\n88\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.680\nNow it's here, Don, that we have so\nmany different options.\n\n89\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.320\nRight?\n\n90\n00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.060\n>> Yeah.\nAnd when you create a constraint,\n\n91\n00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.030\nif you're manually scheduling,\nit's like you said, Ron.\n\n92\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.930\nYou don't need constraints cuz you\nmanually put it on a particular date.\n\n93\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.260\nIf I've got contractors that are available\njust the first three days in June,\n\n94\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.480\nI manually create the task,\nit's not gonna move unless I move it.\n\n95\n00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.070\nBut, if we're auto scheduling, I can\nstretch out a task that happened before,\n\n96\n00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.030\nand it would push this one\nback with auto scheduling.\n\n97\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.130\nAnd so constraints are how we\noverride the Auto Schedule.\n\n98\n00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.040\nAnd you'll see that list of all\nthe constraints that are there.\n\n99\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.005\nAs soon as possible is kinda\nthe default for a project.\n\n100\n00:05:02.005 --> 00:05:02.980\nRight?\nWhich means\n\n101\n00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.670\nif we're auto scheduling this needs\nto just happen as soon as it can.\n\n102\n00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.500\nIt doesn't have to happen\non a particular date,\n\n103\n00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.040\nit just has to happen as soon as it can\nand as late as possible is the same thing.\n\n104\n00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.050\nWhat's the latest we can make this happen\nwithout disrupting the other tasks.\n\n105\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.030\nBut there's a lot of other choices\nin there, aren't there, Ronnie?\n\n106\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.010\n>> There are a lot of other choices that\nactually fall in the range in between.\n\n107\n00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.580\nAnd when you start hearing about them,\n\n108\n00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.680\nyou might hear about what we call\nthe flexible types of constraints.\n\n109\n00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.600\nAnd then there's some\ninflexible ones as well.\n\n110\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.440\nLet me go ahead and\n\n111\n00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.660\ntalk about the inflexible ones that really\nkind of lock us into a particular date.\n\n112\n00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.630\nNotice that what I have here is also\nwhere it actually has the words must.\n\n113\n00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.756\nSo I like skipping around.\n\n114\n00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:40.280\nIt's just the way that my mind works here.\n\n115\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.830\nBut must finish on.\n\n116\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.520\nNow, what that's saying is that whatever\nthe task is, if the task takes three days\n\n117\n00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.690\nand I want it to finish on August 31, I'm\ngoing to start that task before that but\n\n118\n00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.650\nI have to make sure that that actually\nfinishes on that date itself.\n\n119\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.590\nAnd that means everything else\nneeds to revolve around this.\n\n120\n00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.760\nThis particular task is not gonna move.\n\n121\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.230\nOr I have to actually say I can start on.\n\n122\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.750\nThese are what we call\nthe inflexible constraints.\n\n123\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.790\nThey are not going to move.\n\n124\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.500\nOnce we actually set something like that,\nwe're saying here's where it's gonna be,\n\n125\n00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.160\nand that's not gonna actually adjust, the\nautomatic scheduling is not gonna actually\n\n126\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.230\ntake that into consideration at all.\n\n127\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.850\nBut notice that there's also, of course,\nthe Start No Earlier Than and\n\n128\n00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.838\nalso Start No Later Than, as well.\n\n129\n00:06:21.838 --> 00:06:25.180\nWhen Don was talking about what if you\ndo have some contractors that say look,\n\n130\n00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.860\nI really can't make it any\nearlier than September 1st.\n\n131\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.640\nWell, you may choose that constraint and\nsay look, I don't know what the day's\n\n132\n00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.900\ngonna be but I know that I'm not gonna be\nable to start on this task because those\n\n133\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.880\ncontractors are not gonna be able\nto come in before September 1st.\n\n134\n00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.110\nSo that may be a possibility as well.\n\n135\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.530\nAnd then of course, there's the Start\nNo Later Than, which also makes sense.\n\n136\n00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.470\nAnd then there's also the other ones\nhere that are little bit more flexible\n\n137\n00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.890\nFinish No Earlier Than, and\nalso Finish No Later Than.\n\n138\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.470\nNow, Don I've never actually\nworked with a task like that and\n\n139\n00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.590\nI can't even think of an example\nright now that I might think of.\n\n140\n00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.695\n>> Yeah, well you used some great terms\na second ago Ronnie when you said\n\n141\n00:07:00.695 --> 00:07:04.075\na flexible constraint versus\na fixed constraint, right?\n\n142\n00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:06.055\nSometimes we have some flexibility.\n\n143\n00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:10.371\nMaybe I need to get the foundation poured\non a house and I need it to be done so\n\n144\n00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:13.135\nthe drywallers can come in and install it.\n\n145\n00:07:13.135 --> 00:07:16.088\nOkay.\nWell the drywallers are coming in Monday,\n\n146\n00:07:16.088 --> 00:07:19.685\nJune 2nd, I need it to be\nfinished by Sunday, June 1st.\n\n147\n00:07:19.685 --> 00:07:21.730\nI need to be finished before\nthe drywallers get here.\n\n148\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.790\nSo I might say,\nmust finish on June 1st, so\n\n149\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.740\nthat June 2nd, the drywallers can get in.\n\n150\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.000\nBut when I say it must finish on June 1st,\nthat means it's got to finish on June 1st.\n\n151\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.370\nIt can't finish on May 31st or May 30th.\n\n152\n00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.030\nSo there's no point in\ngetting ahead on it.\n\n153\n00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.570\nIt's gotta finish on that date.\n\n154\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.250\nBut Finish No Later Than,\nthat's a different story.\n\n155\n00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.650\nWe can pour the foundation early,\nget it dried and\n\n156\n00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.830\ndone early, as long as it's done before\nthe drywallers get here on June 2nd.\n\n157\n00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.370\nSo you have to look at it as far as\nwhat flexibility you have on that day.\n\n158\n00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.884\nThere's certain things that\nhave no flexibility, and\n\n159\n00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:56.816\ncontractors are generally that, right?\n\n160\n00:07:56.816 --> 00:08:02.858\nYou booked that contract, or you rented\nthat equipment for Wednesday, June 3rd.\n\n161\n00:08:02.858 --> 00:08:05.817\nThat's it, it's just Wednesday,\nJune 3rd, so you can't move it, so\n\n162\n00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:08.050\nyou have to use one of\nthose fixed constraints.\n\n163\n00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.440\nThe start note earlier\nthan that might mean that\n\n164\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.680\nyou don't have the availability for the\npeople but normally it's budget, right?\n\n165\n00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.170\nSo, when we have a budget for a project,\nmaybe your budget's a million dollars.\n\n166\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.250\nBut you're only getting\n$250,000 per quarter.\n\n167\n00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.240\nSo you might have an activity that\nyou wanna start as soon as it can but\n\n168\n00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.005\nno earlier than the start\nof second quarter.\n\n169\n00:08:28.005 --> 00:08:29.550\nCuz that's when you get your next funding.\n\n170\n00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.410\nRight?\nThat's when you'd want those to kick off.\n\n171\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.720\nSo you have to think about your situation\nto figure out which one's better.\n\n172\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:40.890\nNow, Microsoft's official recommendation\nis to not use the fixed constraints.\n\n173\n00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.790\nMust start on, must finish on.\n\n174\n00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.760\nDon't use those unless\nyou absolutely have to.\n\n175\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.800\nSo make sure that your example is truly\na fixed date if you're gonna use those.\n\n176\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.600\nIt doesn't mean you can't use them.\n\n177\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.400\nUse them, but you've gotta be careful.\n\n178\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:52.950\nRight?\n\n179\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.120\nIf you use a flexible one,\nthen you can do things like, well,\n\n180\n00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.110\nwe'll talk about it later in the show,\nwhen we talk about resource leveling.\n\n181\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.500\nYou really can't do resource leveling\nwhen you have fixed constraints on stuff.\n\n182\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.860\nBut when you have flexible\nconstraints you can.\n\n183\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.780\nWhen you have it set to as soon as\npossible or as late as possible, those\n\n184\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.060\nare the absolute best, those are the ones\nthat aren't really even true constraints,\n\n185\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.260\nthey give you tons of\nroom to move around in.\n\n186\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.970\nSo, the more tight your constraints\nare the less flexibility you\n\n187\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.510\nhave in the project.\n\n188\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.340\n>> Yeah, so\nonce we choose a constraint type.\n\n189\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.190\nYou also have to match that up\nto a particular date as well.\n\n190\n00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.360\nAnd notice that we have\nthe constraint date.\n\n191\n00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.600\nSo this is what these constraint\ntypes are actually matched around.\n\n192\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.229\nIf I choose that August 31st date,\nlet me see if I can do that.\n\n193\n00:09:37.229 --> 00:09:38.600\nI can't say it.\n\n194\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.690\nAugust 31st date.\n\n195\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.970\n>> Then I have the as soon as possible,\nand it can actually do that based on that.\n\n196\n00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.440\nSo that's where that date actually\nrevolves around or pivots around.\n\n197\n00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.730\nNow, by default Microsoft project\nwhen you first install all\n\n198\n00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.650\nevery task that you create's gonna\nhave this as soon as possible.\n\n199\n00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:00.500\nNow it doesn't mean it can change if you\nchoose your project finish date instead.\n\n200\n00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.640\nThe defaults are start as latest\npossible for every date as well.\n\n201\n00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.670\nSo there are some defaults\nthat are set in but\n\n202\n00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.900\nyou notice that you can't\nchange them fairly easily to.\n\n203\n00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.672\nSo usually by setting these things up,\nwe're actually now saying,\n\n204\n00:10:12.672 --> 00:10:17.010\nAll right project, go ahead and\nadjust it according to this constraint and\n\n205\n00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.570\nthat way we'll start seeing\nthose dates fill in and\n\n206\n00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.261\nwe'll actually be following\nthese constraints per task.\n\n207\n00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:24.070\n>> Once you get a constraint in,\n\n208\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.990\nthat's something that's gonna\nmess with your schedule.\n\n209\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.600\nNot in a bad way, just messing with\nin the way this kinda required.\n\n210\n00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.375\nBut that means that your auto-scheduling\nis not gonna work as well as it used to,\n\n211\n00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:36.190\ncuz now there's certain\nactivities that can't move.\n\n212\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.280\nAnd so\nMicrosoft wants you to be aware of that.\n\n213\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.722\nWhen you say OK on this Properties screen\nand get back out to your Task List.\n\n214\n00:10:41.722 --> 00:10:45.020\nYou will notice a little icon\nappears beside your task\n\n215\n00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.920\nto let you know that it has a constraint.\n\n216\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.460\nOr like.\n\n217\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.656\n>> Oh, yeah, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n218\n00:10:48.656 --> 00:10:49.747\n>> Actually have to create one.\n\n219\n00:10:49.747 --> 00:10:50.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n220\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.040\n>> So you'll see a little icon appear to\n\n221\n00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.510\nthe left of the task just letting\nyou know there's a constraint there.\n\n222\n00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.230\nSo if you start moving activities or\nyou're trying to resource leveler or\n\n223\n00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.110\nsomething and it's just not working,\nyou wanna look for\n\n224\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.710\nthose guys to have constraints.\n\n225\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.450\nThose are the ones that are stopping you\n\n226\n00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:05.970\nfrom being able to\nmanipulate your project.\n\n227\n00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.570\nThose are the ones that kinda\nremove that flexibility.\n\n228\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.270\n>> Right now we don't\nhave any tasks list so\n\n229\n00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.890\nwe're not seeing that little indicator yet\nthat's saying hey.\n\n230\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.880\nWe're being constrained, but I went ahead\nand set that latest possible date, or\n\n231\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.840\nas late as possible, and\nit may be because of that date that I set.\n\n232\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.660\n>> Well, now, as late as possible,\nand as early as possible,\n\n233\n00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.030\nthose aren't considered constraints.\n\n234\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.770\nThose are the ones that\ngive you true flexibility.\n\n235\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:26.520\nThose are the defaults.\n\n236\n00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.860\nThat's why you didn't get the icon.\n\n237\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:33.640\nBut if you do a must finish on, that's\na fixed constraint, or if you do a finish\n\n238\n00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.030\nno earlier than, finish no later than,\nstart no earlier, start no later than.\n\n239\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.350\nThose guys, those are the ones\nthat'll cause the icon to appear, and\n\n240\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.570\nthen yep there you go,\nit looks like a little calendar and\n\n241\n00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.200\nthat's saying basically\nthis one's tied to a date.\n\n242\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.340\nSo I can only move it so\nmuch cuz it's tied to a date and\n\n243\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.380\nthat's that visual indicator.\n\n244\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.810\nBut yeah, I'm glad you did that, Ronnie.\n\n245\n00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.020\nIf you choose as soon as possible or\n\n246\n00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.190\nas late as possible,\nthose are the default constraints.\n\n247\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.990\nThose aren't considered fixed or\neven flexible.\n\n248\n00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.950\nThey're just considered the default ones,\nso you won't get the icon on those.\n\n249\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.320\nYeah.\n\n250\n00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.140\nAll right, now those are some\nexamples of constraints and\n\n251\n00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.450\nthey're pretty heavy handed.\n\n252\n00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:13.290\nThere's another type of constraint that we\ndon't really see as a drop down box but\n\n253\n00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.940\nit's really important.\n\n254\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.570\nAnd that is one activity might not\nbe fixed to a particular date,\n\n255\n00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.560\nit might be fixed to another activity.\n\n256\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.770\nRemember my example of if we're laying\nthe foundation of a house that's got to\n\n257\n00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.180\nbe done before we can put the walls up,\n\n258\n00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.930\nyou can't put the walls up if\nthe floors not there right?\n\n259\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:35.380\nSo it makes logical sense in our mind that\nyou've gotta finish the foundation and\n\n260\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.300\nthen you can start the walls, you can't\nstart the walls before the foundation\n\n261\n00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.200\nis done because people would be\nstepping in wet cement right?\n\n262\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.180\nSo there's a logical order to our\nactivities regardless of what\n\n263\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.500\ndate they fall on.\n\n264\n00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.610\nAnd so for that we may need to create\na different kind of constraint.\n\n265\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.170\nWhat's called a relationship\nbetween the activities so\n\n266\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.490\nwe can kinda define the order\nthat things are gonna occur.\n\n267\n00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.390\n>> We're gonna start talking about,\nyou may hear the term dependency,\n\n268\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.980\nis what we're talking a look at.\n\n269\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.010\nSo if you do have projects\nin which you're saying,\n\n270\n00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.910\nlook I have to make sure this is done\nbefore that second step can begin.\n\n271\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.000\nWe can do that as well and\ninside of Microsoft product,\n\n272\n00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.110\nthey actually show us four basic types\nof dependencies that we can set up and\n\n273\n00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.630\nthe strange thing of course,\nis even though, if you take a look at\n\n274\n00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.810\nthe Microsoft support,\nyou won't see this term everywhere.\n\n275\n00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.350\nYou won't see the term,\nlinked dependencies,\n\n276\n00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.590\nyou'll see the term predecessors a lot,\nis what you'll actually end up seeing, so\n\n277\n00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.960\nlet me show you what I'm\ntalking about instead.\n\n278\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.630\nSo if I wanted to go ahead and make sure\nthat I put these in the right order so\n\n279\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.010\nthat things start filling in\nthe way that they need to,\n\n280\n00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:38.080\nwhat I actually can do is I\ncan take a task that I have.\n\n281\n00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.160\nI'm gonna select,\n\n282\n00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.468\nlet's say, installing the Wyse Thin Client\nhere just as an example.\n\n283\n00:13:43.468 --> 00:13:48.610\nIf I right-click on that task I can\ngo down to Project Information.\n\n284\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.370\nAnd then I can select Predecessor.\n\n285\n00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.040\nAnd when I do that I have\na couple of options here, but\n\n286\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.540\nright away I can select Task Name and\nI click on that drop-down.\n\n287\n00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:04.950\nAnd let's say I wanna link that to\nthe installing and configuring the server.\n\n288\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:09.540\nWhen I do that, that's actually task 22,\nI can also add in the task ID number, and\n\n289\n00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.830\nthat will do it as well.\n\n290\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.560\nAnd this is what we're talking about\nas far as these different dependencies.\n\n291\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.190\nNow, remember,\n\n292\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.330\nyou don't see the term dependency here,\nyou see the term predecessor,\n\n293\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.380\nand that's because you're always linking\nto what should precede this task here.\n\n294\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.560\nAnd we have finish to start,\n\n295\n00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.400\nstart to start, finish to finish,\nstart to finish here too.\n\n296\n00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.690\nThe default relationship type or\n\n297\n00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.020\ndependency is what we\ncall Finish to Start.\n\n298\n00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.612\nAnd what that's saying is that this\nparticular task that I have right here,\n\n299\n00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:42.631\nwhich is actually Task #23,\ninstalling the Wise Thin client,\n\n300\n00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:46.380\nIt is dependent upon\nthe finish of the predecessor.\n\n301\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.660\nSo in other words, installing the server\nactually is gonna be, everything\n\n302\n00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:56.050\nis done before you actually can begin this\nprocess of installing the thin client.\n\n303\n00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.410\n>> Yeah, and this is the most common\ntype of dependency that we set up.\n\n304\n00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.160\nIf you have three activities and\n\n305\n00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.190\nthey need to happen in order,\nactivity one, it finishes,\n\n306\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.290\nthen activity two starts, activity two\nfinishes then activity three starts.\n\n307\n00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.320\nThose are finish to start relationships.\n\n308\n00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.680\nThis is the one that you use the most,\nand so\n\n309\n00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.550\nit's the first on the list,\nfinish to start or FS.\n\n310\n00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.050\nIf you've done PMI training or\n\n311\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.460\nsomething you'll hear them refer\nto it by just the two letters.\n\n312\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.610\nFinish to start is normal.\n\n313\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.420\nIt's what we logically think of.\n\n314\n00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.130\nBut things aren't always like that.\n\n315\n00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:30.290\nSometimes I might have more than one\nactivity that can start at the same time.\n\n316\n00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.120\nI might have three different activities\nthat are all ready to launch all at once.\n\n317\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.110\nI could have the drywallers putting the\nwall up at the same time as the plumbers\n\n318\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.570\nwho are hooking up the plumbing\nfixtures in the house.\n\n319\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:45.125\nSo those, I might wanna set\na start to start relationship.\n\n320\n00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:48.330\nStart-to-start says,\none activity starts and\n\n321\n00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.430\nthese other activities can\nstart at the same time.\n\n322\n00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.980\nRight?\n\n323\n00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.705\nIt's not as common as finish-to-start, you\nfinish one thing, the next thing starts.\n\n324\n00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:58.081\nBut start-to-start is another\npretty common one that's out there.\n\n325\n00:15:58.081 --> 00:15:59.791\n>> So in my project plan I went ahead and\n\n326\n00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:03.786\nset up another task that actually kinda\nhelps us logically think about this, too.\n\n327\n00:16:03.786 --> 00:16:05.866\nSo we tested a couple of\ndifferent thin clients.\n\n328\n00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:10.560\nWe put a Windows thin PC and\nwe also had our wise thin client.\n\n329\n00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.380\nI don't have to wait for those to\nactually finish one after the other.\n\n330\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.620\nI can even select this installing\nthe Windows thin PC and\n\n331\n00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.060\ninstalling the wise thin client,\nand link those together as well.\n\n332\n00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.700\nNow when we do that.\n\n333\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.160\nOnce again, I'm gonna right click on task\nnumber 25 there, and go to information.\n\n334\n00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.210\nAnd then select the predecessor, and\n\n335\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:35.160\nfrom this one I need to actually link it\nto task number 24, is what I need to do.\n\n336\n00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.640\nAnd so, i'm just gonna type in the ID\nnumber, and then I change that start here.\n\n337\n00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.910\nAnd now what we're saying\nis what Don was telling us.\n\n338\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.230\nIs that those two tasks have\nbeen linked together, and so\n\n339\n00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.500\nwe can being the installation of\nboth of those at the same day.\n\n340\n00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.940\nNow, when you take a look at it\ngraphically over here on the Gantt chart,\n\n341\n00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.740\nyou'll also begin to notice\nsome of the differences.\n\n342\n00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.427\nSo, the default one, you can see\nwhere it actually comes off the end\n\n343\n00:16:58.427 --> 00:17:02.780\nof this one task on this bar, and then\ngoes into the beginning of the other task.\n\n344\n00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.810\nSo it's saying, when this finishes,\nstart this one.\n\n345\n00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:10.490\nBut notice that these two are both\nlinked on the start side of that task.\n\n346\n00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.130\nSo you will see these links here too,\nand that's why they also call them link\n\n347\n00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.500\ndependencies, as well as just\nreferring to the predecessor number.\n\n348\n00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.160\nIn the predecessor column,\n\n349\n00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.910\nyou will see that the default one\ndoesn't have that fs marking.\n\n350\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.800\nBut notice if you change from\nthat default, it actually gives\n\n351\n00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.080\nyou a little additional abbreviation\nto help you to understand that\n\n352\n00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.480\nthis particular predecessor it actually\nis changed from the default one too.\n\n353\n00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.000\n>> Yeah, and you can actually build\nall your dependencies right here,\n\n354\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.600\nfrom the task list.\n\n355\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.560\nYou don't have to go into\nthe information screen.\n\n356\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.340\nSo Ronnie could have typed\nin 24SS there and done it,\n\n357\n00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.370\nor maybe that next task, 2.5 there,\nif you want that one to be linked to 24,\n\n358\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.250\nyou just type 24SS, and it'll do it,\nit'll punch it right in.\n\n359\n00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:53.600\nYou can also highlight more than one\ntask and hit the link button up top.\n\n360\n00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.740\nNow, the only problem with that\none is when you highlight them and\n\n361\n00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.170\nhit that link button,\nit does a finish to start by default.\n\n362\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.380\nSo it's gonna link those in kind of a\nchronological order, one after the other.\n\n363\n00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.820\nAnd so if you need to change it\nto a different dependency type,\n\n364\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.480\nyou'll have to go in and modify it.\n\n365\n00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.540\nSo, Ronnie, you wanna show kind of.\n\n366\n00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.180\n>> Yeah.\nSure did.\n\n367\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.370\n>> Linking those all at once?\n\n368\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:11.870\n>> Yep.\n\n369\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.800\n>> So, you just did.\n\n370\n00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.520\nI'm sorry,\nI wasn't seeing it on the Gantt chart.\n\n371\n00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.060\n>> That's fine.\n\n372\n00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:20.850\nSo, if I go ahead and I select those tasks\nthat I believe that I wanna link together\n\n373\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.440\nright away, I can just highlight and\nselect those tasks that I want.\n\n374\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.850\nI go up to task, and\nthen under the schedule section grouping,\n\n375\n00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.440\nI can then look for\nlink the selected task.\n\n376\n00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.140\nAnd that will automatically put them\nin that default link that we have.\n\n377\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.990\nNow over on the Gantt chart side,\nyou're probably like,\n\n378\n00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.320\nwhere in the world did that actually go?\n\n379\n00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.310\nWell, it did actually kind of\nfly over there to the right, so\n\n380\n00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.010\nI'm going to use my scroll to task.\n\n381\n00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.510\nAnd you can see now where it's\nactually linking it and also,\n\n382\n00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.320\nnotice what's happening to the dates\nsince we started linking them as well.\n\n383\n00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.870\nSo on these, you can tell that 3.1 is\nscheduled to begin on the 30th, but\n\n384\n00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.050\nnotice that on the last one that I\nlinked is scheduled to start on 10/6.\n\n385\n00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:02.850\nSo now we're starting to see the power\nof Project's scheduling engine.\n\n386\n00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.770\nIn the background saying, hey,\nyou're using these links.\n\n387\n00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.420\nHere's all the constraints that you have,\nthat default constraint.\n\n388\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.930\nAnd so when one task finishes,\nthe other task is gonna begin.\n\n389\n00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.840\nAnd it starts linking them together.\n\n390\n00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.300\nAnd so that's where you see the result\nof what we're talking about here,\n\n391\n00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.800\nis now we're actually allowing\nit to do it this way.\n\n392\n00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.470\n>> Yeah, and we can always go back and\n\n393\n00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.620\nupdate those to change them from finish\nto start, to start to start or whatever.\n\n394\n00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.890\nNow, finish to start and start to start.\n\n395\n00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.690\nI used those two all the time.\n\n396\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:34.500\nBut there's two more types of dependency\nthat we set that are less commonly used.\n\n397\n00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.130\nAll right.\n\n398\n00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.648\nFor example, start to finish,\nand finish to finish.\n\n399\n00:19:38.648 --> 00:19:39.241\nAll right.\n\n400\n00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:42.030\nFinish to finish means\nI've got two activities\n\n401\n00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.860\nthat need to finish at the same time.\n\n402\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.320\nOne can't finish if\nthe other isn't finished.\n\n403\n00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.030\nAnd I know that sounds weird, but\nlet me give you a great example.\n\n404\n00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.590\nWe'll use construction again.\n\n405\n00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.050\nSo if you're building the house, and\n\n406\n00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.810\nyour last step is to prepare the house for\nsale.\n\n407\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.230\nWell, when you're done building a house,\n\n408\n00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.140\nyou've got to have inspectors come and\ninspect.\n\n409\n00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.420\nAnd let's break it down even to a smaller\npiece, maybe the plumber is doing\n\n410\n00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.430\nthe plumbing work, and now the inspector\nneeds to sign off on that.\n\n411\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.000\nAll right?\n\n412\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.450\nSo you might have an activity for\n\n413\n00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:13.690\ninstalling the plumbing, and can they\nfinish before the permits are done?\n\n414\n00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.135\nNo, we have to pass inspection.\n\n415\n00:20:16.135 --> 00:20:18.930\nCan the inspection finish,\nif the plumbing isn't done?\n\n416\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.250\nNo, they actually finish at the same time.\n\n417\n00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.580\nIf the inspector finds a problem,\nthe plumbers gotta fix it.\n\n418\n00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.210\nAnd so those two are linked.\n\n419\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.710\nSo they would be finish to finish.\n\n420\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.690\nInstalling the plumbing doesn't\nfinish until we pass inspections, and\n\n421\n00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.970\npassing inspections doesn't\nfinish until plumbing is done.\n\n422\n00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.710\nSo those two are linked together, and that\nwould be a finish to finish, all right.\n\n423\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.230\nNot as common, but they are out there.\n\n424\n00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.403\nAnd then the least common, the absolute\nleast way, one that I can honestly tell\n\n425\n00:20:45.403 --> 00:20:48.716\nyou I've never used in production,\nIs the finished to start.\n\n426\n00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:49.752\n>> The start to finish.\n\n427\n00:20:49.752 --> 00:20:53.755\n>> It's, oh sorry.\n\n428\n00:20:53.755 --> 00:20:54.299\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> So\n\n429\n00:20:54.299 --> 00:20:58.850\nstart to finish says that I can't\nfinish until something else starts and\n\n430\n00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.990\nthat's why I got it backwards\nwith the other one.\n\n431\n00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.150\n>> Yeah.\n>> So that seems weird, right?\n\n432\n00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.600\nSomething else finishes and\nI can start, that makes sense.\n\n433\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.460\nBut I can't finish until\nsomebody else starts.\n\n434\n00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.350\nWhat's that all about?\n\n435\n00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.090\nAnd I really only have\none good example of it.\n\n436\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.890\nAnd it's studying for a test, right?\n\n437\n00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:19.800\nThink about when you were in school, or\nmaybe you were in college or whatever.\n\n438\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.120\nAnd you're studying for an exam.\n\n439\n00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.760\nWell, when do you finish studying?\n\n440\n00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.605\nTechnically, you don't finish\nstudying until you start the exam.\n\n441\n00:21:25.605 --> 00:21:29.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're studying right up until that\n\n442\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:29.800\nlast minute.\n\n443\n00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.240\nYou sit down and start on the exam, and\nthat's when your studying stops All right.\n\n444\n00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:38.630\nSo, I can't finish studying\nuntil the exams starts.\n\n445\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.870\nIt's not studying that determines\nwhen the exam is gonna start.\n\n446\n00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.700\nRight, normally when we have finish\nto start, It's activity one finishing\n\n447\n00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.840\nthat determines when\nactivity two is gonna start.\n\n448\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.740\nBut when I'm talking about the exam,\n\n449\n00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.240\nit's not when I finish\nstudying that the exam starts.\n\n450\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.580\nThe exam has a date that it's gonna start.\n\n451\n00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.600\nAnd that's what determines when\nactivity one is gonna finish.\n\n452\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.960\nSo that's kind of a weird relationship.\n\n453\n00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.660\nBut it is there.\n\n454\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.640\nIt is something that's out there.\n\n455\n00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.560\nAnd just think about who it is.\n\n456\n00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.360\nWhich activity is actually\nin control of the link?\n\n457\n00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.690\nIf it's the second activity\nthat's in control of the link and\n\n458\n00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:16.120\nnot the first one, then you're gonna\nhave one of those start to finishes.\n\n459\n00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.190\nThe second activity starting is what\nallows the first activity to finish.\n\n460\n00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.860\nIt's weird.\n\n461\n00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.050\nIt's backwards.\n\n462\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.130\nI've never had to use that\nin a production project.\n\n463\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.590\nBut it is there, and\nthe support is available if you need it.\n\n464\n00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:31.170\n>> Yeah, I get confused by the language as\nwell, cuz start to finish sounds natural.\n\n465\n00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.070\nYou know start to finish.\n\n466\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.900\nFinish to start doesn't sound natural,\nbut that's actually the most common.\n\n467\n00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.690\nSo when you do see that start to finish,\nmore than likely it's probably not gonna\n\n468\n00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.310\nbe the general choice that we're\ngonna make for most things.\n\n469\n00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.460\nBut remember those other three, right, the\nstart to start, the finish to finish, and\n\n470\n00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.290\nof course the most common by\nfar is the finish to start.\n\n471\n00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.940\nSo those are some of the different\nways we can link then.\n\n472\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.110\nEach of those tasks to a dependency,\n\n473\n00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.250\nand then we'll actually start seeing\nthe project scheduling engine\n\n474\n00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:00.130\nreally start beginning to fill out\nthe actual dates for us from that point.\n\n475\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:00.930\n>> Yeah, and\n\n476\n00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.250\nwe had some good questions in the chat\nroom there about the smaller components.\n\n477\n00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.200\nYou have to be careful.\n\n478\n00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.850\nWhen you have smaller components in your\nproject, if you start setting up a lot\n\n479\n00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.590\nof dependencies, saying all these\ndifferent components can't finish\n\n480\n00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.370\nuntil something else finishes, you can end\nup with a lot of open ended activities.\n\n481\n00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.370\nAnd it makes reporting really difficult\ncuz they might be 100% done, but\n\n482\n00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.810\ntwo weeks goes by and\nthey still show that they're not complete,\n\n483\n00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.710\nit really starts to skew your reports.\n\n484\n00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.000\nSo even though it might be true that yeah,\n\n485\n00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.510\nthey're not truly finished\nuntil the over all one is done.\n\n486\n00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.170\nYou might choose to go ahead and\nflag them as finished anyway, and\n\n487\n00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.780\nuse a standard finish\nto start relationship.\n\n488\n00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.480\nSo it kinda depends on how big the project\nis, how you're gonna handle that.\n\n489\n00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.840\nEverybody's usage is a little\nbit different there.\n\n490\n00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.780\nAnd you can always use milestones for\ntracking this stuff too.\n\n491\n00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.600\nInstead of relying on the link\ndependencies to do that, so\n\n492\n00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.360\nit's really up to you how\nyou want to handle that.\n\n493\n00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.997\nThat's the neat part about Project\nis they give you all these tools,\n\n494\n00:23:51.997 --> 00:23:53.416\nyou don't have to use them, right?\n\n495\n00:23:53.416 --> 00:23:56.820\nYou kind of pick the ones that make\ngood sense for your environment.\n\n496\n00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.190\nNow, if you've got a ton\nof smaller elements,\n\n497\n00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.190\nyou might even wanna break\nthose out into sub projects.\n\n498\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.900\nAnd we're gonna talk about sub\nprojects in another episode, but\n\n499\n00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.900\nit is another option that's out there.\n\n500\n00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.910\nAll right, so Ronnie, we talked about\nsome of the links and dependencies.\n\n501\n00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:14.240\nWe talked about some of\nthe constraints that can get created,\n\n502\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.940\nthose are all gonna manipulate it.\n\n503\n00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.030\nWhat else do we have?\n\n504\n00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.400\nIs that?\n\n505\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.100\n>> We just really talked\nabout those two things.\n\n506\n00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.740\nAnd making sure that we\ncould link them together and\n\n507\n00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.370\nshowed you how to be able to do it.\n\n508\n00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.740\nThere are multiple ways to do this.\n\n509\n00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.140\nSo don't just think the way that I\nshowed you through the property,\n\n510\n00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.340\nthe task information properties,\nthat that's the only way to do it.\n\n511\n00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.280\nRemember you can do it directly\nfrom the entry table itself, or\n\n512\n00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.210\neven just using the column too.\n\n513\n00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.130\nNow when we start taking look at this.\n\n514\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:38.970\nThis is the very beginning here.\n\n515\n00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.870\nRemember that there are a couple\nof different things.\n\n516\n00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.240\nIf all the sudden everything's grayed out,\nmore than likely,\n\n517\n00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.750\nthat task is manually set, and that means,\nyeah, Project, don't mess with me.\n\n518\n00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.390\nBut now that we actually set that as auto,\nit actually started filling things in,\n\n519\n00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.260\nand that's what we're also wanting to see.\n\n520\n00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.130\nSo some of those little tricky things,\nand pay attention,\n\n521\n00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.390\nespecially, to the links as\nyou're preparing for the exam.\n\n522\n00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.840\nI guarantee you'll see a question or\ntwo on those things.\n\n523\n00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.840\n>> Yeah, and, Ronnie,\nyou mentioned auto scheduling, and\n\n524\n00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.700\nwe've talked about it a few times.\n\n525\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.400\nAs we build these dependencies,\n\n526\n00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.470\nit is really important to understand\nhow auto scheduling works.\n\n527\n00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.000\nAnd we don't have enough time\nleft in this episode, but Ronnie,\n\n528\n00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.930\nI think we should probably\ndo a part two on this one,\n\n529\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.770\nand take a look at the formulas\nthat go into that mix.\n\n530\n00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.250\n>> Right.\n>> Because when you set these\n\n531\n00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.000\ndependencies, it's kind of laying them\nout in that Gantt chart in a certain way.\n\n532\n00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.160\nAnd as we start manipulating activities,\nthings happen.\n\n533\n00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.890\nThings start to move.\n\n534\n00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.640\nThat's what auto scheduling is all about.\n\n535\n00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.910\nAnd you've really gotta have a good\nunderstanding of that to know when do\n\n536\n00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:37.780\nI need to do a constraint,versus when\nit okay to just let Project handle it.\n\n537\n00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.640\nHopefully we can let Project\nhandle it in most cases.\n\n538\n00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.730\nSometimes you can't.\n\n539\n00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.810\nMaking that decision,\n\n540\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.430\nrequires us to understand the math\nthat's going on behind the scenes.\n\n541\n00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:50.210\nAnd so a big part of that is the auto\nscheduling formulas that Microsoft uses,\n\n542\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:54.020\nand they want to hide that from the user\nfor the most part, don't deal with it.\n\n543\n00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.610\nBut if you want to be\nsuccessful with Project,\n\n544\n00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:56.490\nyou do have to have an understanding.\n\n545\n00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.530\nSo we're gonna do a part two on\nthis episode where we'll take\n\n546\n00:25:58.530 --> 00:25:59.950\na look at that math behind the scenes.\n\n547\n00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.790\n>> Right.\n>> Get a chance to see how auto scheduling\n\n548\n00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.540\nis working and breaking that down.\n\n549\n00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:08.400\nBut for most people, setting up the four\nlink type dependencies; finish to start,\n\n550\n00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.970\nstart to start, start to finish and\nfinish to finish,\n\n551\n00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.430\nthose four that is going to be more than\nenough to kind of set the hierarchy.\n\n552\n00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.320\nAnd then we use the constraints,\nthe fixed and\n\n553\n00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.270\nflexible constraints to force certain\nactivities to happen on certain days.\n\n554\n00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.450\nBetween those,\nthat is more than enough for most people.\n\n555\n00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.710\nIn advance scenarios you'll\nneed to know a little more and\n\n556\n00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.520\nthat's where part two will come in.\n\n557\n00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.360\n>> Sounds good.\n\n558\n00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.120\n>> All right.\nWell Ronnie I think that's a good episode\n\n559\n00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.610\nright here, so\nwe'll go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n560\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:34.840\nHope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n561\n00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.320\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n562\n00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.140\n>> I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n563\n00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.087\n>> And we'll see

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:13.858 --> 00:00:16.500\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.280\nI'm your host Don Pizet back\nagain with Mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.150\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.210\n>> I am doing well today,\n\n8\n00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410\nbut not really excited because we're\ntalking about math today, Don.\n\n9\n00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.000\n>> Pesky math.\n\n10\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.680\n>> Math.\n\n11\n00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.750\n>> Well we're kinda lucky though\nbecause one of the nice things that\n\n12\n00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.530\nMicrosoft Project does for\nus is hide the math.\n\n13\n00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.270\nWhen we put data in here, there's actually\na lot of formulas and calculations that\n\n14\n00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.330\nare going on in the background and\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n15\n00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.840\nHowever, to really understand how\nour product is being managed and\n\n16\n00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.650\nhow things like auto scheduling work,\n\n17\n00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.520\nwe do need to have a good grasp of\nwhat's going on in the background.\n\n18\n00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.150\nAnd Project 2013's really good about this,\nbut previous versions of Project\n\n19\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.500\nlike Project 2010 and earlier,\nthey sometimes really screw up the math.\n\n20\n00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.420\nHave you ever had that happen,\nRonnie, where the math gets broken?\n\n21\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.990\n>> I have.\nYeah.\n\n22\n00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.080\nSometimes when you actually do set things\ninside of Project, also you're expecting\n\n23\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.830\nto see something, and wait a minute,\nthat didn't turn out right.\n\n24\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.350\nSo you remove it, and\nnow you see another thing appear, and\n\n25\n00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.980\nyou're like, wait a minute,\nI didn't mean for all that to happen.\n\n26\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.820\nThe only recourse you had is\nhopefully you didn't hit save and\n\n27\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.010\nyou just kind of start all over and\ndo that again.\n\n28\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.150\nProject 2013 has kind of helped to\nsimplify some of the things and try and\n\n29\n00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.510\ncorrect some of the previous\nthings that they had.\n\n30\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.840\nBut they've also offered a lot more\nexplanations on their support forums to\n\n31\n00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.280\ntry and help you out as well.\n\n32\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.800\n>> Yeah, and you can avoid that\n\n33\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.650\nif you understand the math that's\nhappening in the background, and this is\n\n34\n00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.550\na frustration point with a lot of people\nthat try to use Microsoft Project and\n\n35\n00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.620\nthey're self-taught, like, I'm just\ngonna get in here and figure it out.\n\n36\n00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.250\nWell you can figure out a lot of stuff,\nbut\n\n37\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.725\nthe math almost starts to look\nlike voodoo magic, before the end.\n\n38\n00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:48.580\n[LAUGH] I don't understand,\nwhy did this number not change?\n\n39\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.590\nAnd it's because there's a certain order\nthat Microsoft expects us to put data in\n\n40\n00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.460\nand it all boils down\nto how a task is setup.\n\n41\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.230\nSo Ronnie let's take a look at that.\n\n42\n00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.190\nWhen I create a task,\nthere's a default right, that's happening.\n\n43\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.890\nEvery task is created equally when\nwe start setting up projects.\n\n44\n00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.930\nBut that's not really true in real life.\n\n45\n00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.630\nSo we're gonna have to\n\n46\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.070\nmanipulate some tasks that\nare a little bit different right?\n\n47\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.180\n>> They really are.\n\n48\n00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.527\nWhen you start taking a look at it, the\ntasks that are set up by default are gonna\n\n49\n00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:19.040\nbe set up according to the way that\nyou already set up some of the things.\n\n50\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.490\nBut at the beginning here if you want\nProject to really work with them,\n\n51\n00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.970\nyou're gonna actually have to\nsee that some of the tasks that\n\n52\n00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.780\nyou set up are gonna be\nwhat we call effort-driven.\n\n53\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.330\nSo of them are actually not gonna be\neffort driven, and what impact that that\n\n54\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.350\nmay make on that task, especially\nthe overall duration of that task as well.\n\n55\n00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.930\nSo there are some basic formulas\nthat we just have to kind of get\n\n56\n00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.540\nused to working with.\n\n57\n00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.920\nAnd to see whether or not that effort\nof driven verses non effort driven\n\n58\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.020\nis going to actually make on that task.\n\n59\n00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.450\nSo when we start talking about the idea of\neffort driven tasks then, is what we're\n\n60\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.170\ngoing to say here is that an effort\ndriven task will shorten the duration\n\n61\n00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.040\nof the task when a resource is assigned\nand more resources are assigned.\n\n62\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.120\nSo you have one resource assigned to\na task and they are actually set to work\n\n63\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.030\ntheir eight hour day on that task, well,\nthey're actually going to be assigned that\n\n64\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.680\ntask full time, and they'll work\non that for eight hours a day.\n\n65\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.100\nBut if you assign a second resource to it,\nyou're gonna see the duration of that task\n\n66\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.960\nis gonna also end up\nbeing shorter as well.\n\n67\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.870\nNow when it's not effort driven, well,\n\n68\n00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.400\nit's not gonna affect\nthe task in that way too.\n\n69\n00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.740\nSo you do have those two options\nto be able to set that up.\n\n70\n00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.490\nSo on my computer, I went ahead and\n\n71\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.140\njust opened up a simple project here,\nand I created a task for\n\n72\n00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.550\nus, and I made it the auto-scheduled\nmode and just assigned a task one.\n\n73\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.540\nWhen I did that, it automatically filled\nin a little bit of information for\n\n74\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.090\nme just right at the beginning.\n\n75\n00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.230\nIt gave me a one day duration,\na start date, and a finish date,\n\n76\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.230\nbecause it's actually\nnot doing anything else.\n\n77\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.350\nBut at the beginning here though,\nif I didn't set that up, you're\n\n78\n00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.690\ngonna see that some of the stuff doesn't\nactually turn out that it needs to.\n\n79\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.790\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n80\n00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.510\nSo if I right click on that task and\nI go to task information, you're gonna see\n\n81\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.120\nright here under the advanced that you\nhave this box that says effort driven.\n\n82\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.260\nAnd this one by default is\nactually not effort driven.\n\n83\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.090\nAnd that means if I\nassign resources to it,\n\n84\n00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.860\nit's not gonna affect the overall\nduration of that task right now.\n\n85\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.352\nSo that's what we're normally talking\nabout when we talk about the difference\n\n86\n00:04:24.352 --> 00:04:27.027\nbetween an effort driven versus\na non-effort driven task.\n\n87\n00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:27.730\n[COUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n88\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.160\nand you just have to think about the work\nthat's being done as to whether or\n\n89\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.530\nnot more people can help.\n\n90\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.950\nLet me give you a just couple of\nexamples to help illustrate it if you're\n\n91\n00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.589\nstill confused.\n\n92\n00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.260\nPainting my house.\n\n93\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.070\nThe exterior of my house\nneeds to be painted.\n\n94\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.000\nI recognize that and\nwe can hire somebody to come and paint it.\n\n95\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.100\nNow if you look at\nthe size of the house and\n\n96\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.620\nthe amount of work that has to be done,\nwe can think of it in terms of work,\n\n97\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.750\nthat it would probably take\nten hours to paint my house.\n\n98\n00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.690\nNow if I have one painter come,\nit's gonna be ten hours.\n\n99\n00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.390\nIf I have two painters come,\n\n100\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.380\nthey can get done in five hours because\nthere's two people working on it.\n\n101\n00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.670\nIt's still ten hours of work being done,\nit's just overlapping, right?\n\n102\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.785\nIf I'm paying them,\nlet's say I pay then $15 an hour, right?\n\n103\n00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:14.925\nIf it's one painter doing the ten\nhours of work, it's gonna be $150.\n\n104\n00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:20.118\nIf it's two painters getting it done\nin five hours, it's still $150,\n\n105\n00:05:20.118 --> 00:05:24.490\nbecause they both work five hours each and\nit overlapped, right?\n\n106\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.920\nThat was effort-driven.\n\n107\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.850\nThe more effort, I can shorten the time.\n\n108\n00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.800\nIt's still the same amount of work\nbeing done, it's just overlapping.\n\n109\n00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.260\nVersus something like travel, right.\n\n110\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.690\nIf I've got a task that says this person\nhas to get from Gainesville to Orlando,\n\n111\n00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.540\nwell that's a two hour drive.\n\n112\n00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.300\nIf I assign two people to that task,\nnow there's two of them driving,\n\n113\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.590\nit's still two hours.\n\n114\n00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.040\nIt doesn't matter how many\npeople I pile onto that task,\n\n115\n00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.240\nthe drive is going to take two hours.\n\n116\n00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.710\nThat's not effort driven,\n\n117\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.445\nthere's no amount of effort I can put into\nit to reduce that without breaking laws.\n\n118\n00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:56.580\n[LAUGH] So, so\n\n119\n00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.800\nthat's the big difference and Microsoft\nProject can't figure that out for you.\n\n120\n00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.430\nIt doesn't know whether your\nactivity is effort-driven or not, so\n\n121\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.620\nyou've got to tell it.\n\n122\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.399\nAnd it's in the project options where you\ncan set whether tasks are effort-driven by\n\n123\n00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:12.338\ndefault or not.\n\n124\n00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:12.936\nWe talked about it in another episode.\n\n125\n00:06:12.936 --> 00:06:14.054\n>> We did.\n\n126\n00:06:14.054 --> 00:06:17.630\n>> So most of the time though we'll find\nthat a lot of our tasks aren't effort\n\n127\n00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.010\ndriven and\nmaybe you want that to be the default.\n\n128\n00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.110\nOr maybe in your business,\nthey are effort driven and\n\n129\n00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.200\nyou want that to be the default so you\ncan change that in the project options.\n\n130\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.480\nOr you can overwrite it on a per\nactivity basis like Ronnie says.\n\n131\n00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.710\n>> Yeah, when we start taking\na look then at Project and\n\n132\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.960\nthen starting to see some of the way\nthe calculations are going to work,\n\n133\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.980\nwe have to actually understand\nthere is a basic formula,\n\n134\n00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.730\nthat we really need to understand to be\nable to figure some of this stuff out.\n\n135\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.930\nAnd having this stuff in your mind\nis really going to help you out.\n\n136\n00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.470\nBut the basis of Project formulas really\nrely on one formula in particular,\n\n137\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.570\nwhich is the one I have\nup here on the screen.\n\n138\n00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.220\nWhen you take the duration and\nyou multiply it times\n\n139\n00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.410\nthe units of work that you have,\nthat will give you the work or\n\n140\n00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.000\nwork hours that you're actually gonna end\nup doing, which is perfectly fine, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.820\nNow from that you can derive these other\ntwo formulas by using the math that you\n\n142\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.180\nlearned in algebra, right, to get\neverything on one side of the equal sign.\n\n143\n00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.760\nNotice that if I wanted\nto figure out duration,\n\n144\n00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.480\nI can take the amount of work hours\nthat I have and divide it by the units.\n\n145\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.400\nWhich is the amount of time that\na resource can spend on that work and\n\n146\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.570\nthen you'll get the overall timing of it,\nand then to go on a figure out units\n\n147\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.880\nyou're gonna actually get work\ndivided by duration as well.\n\n148\n00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.620\nSo all these other two are really\nderivatives of what you see.\n\n149\n00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.450\nHere is the basic formula that you want\nto actually be able to understand,\n\n150\n00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.690\nbecause that's the numbers that are really\ngoing to end up showing up at times\n\n151\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.060\nwhen you actually are working with\nthis and when you manipulate them.\n\n152\n00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.920\nNow, in Project, you can actually\nmanipulate these things and\n\n153\n00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.275\nwhat they're expecting you to do is to\ndo exactly like what this formula says.\n\n154\n00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:54.813\nYou're going to provide two out\nof three of these options, and\n\n155\n00:07:54.813 --> 00:07:57.094\nit will figure out the third one for you.\n\n156\n00:07:57.094 --> 00:08:00.987\nOkay, so it's kind of neat that\nthe project already went ahead and\n\n157\n00:08:00.987 --> 00:08:05.433\ndid that for us unless that happened But\nit is a neat the first time you do it and\n\n158\n00:08:05.433 --> 00:08:08.030\nyou're like, wow, how did that work out?\n\n159\n00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:13.330\nAnd then you, in earlier editions in 2003,\nyou go, that wasn't what I was expecting.\n\n160\n00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.050\nYou remove that and\n\n161\n00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.560\nall of a sudden he numbers change again\nas it recalculates something else.\n\n162\n00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.920\nIt can be very important that you actually\nhave these things set up correctly.\n\n163\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.140\nSo just remember this\nbasic formula here and\n\n164\n00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.930\nwe're gonna show you how it\nactually works inside a project.\n\n165\n00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.960\n>> The part that confused me when I first\ngot started with project is in your main\n\n166\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.650\ngan chart view you see your duration and\nyou see your resources, right?\n\n167\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.612\nIn your resources that's the people\nassigned those are basically your\n\n168\n00:08:37.612 --> 00:08:41.130\nunits and you kind of assume that those\nunits are 100% assigned to your project.\n\n169\n00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.230\nBut they might not be,\nso you don't see that.\n\n170\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.120\nAnd then work, that's completely\nhidden in the Gantt chart view.\n\n171\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.310\nSo you don't necessarily realize this\nformula is happening because you don't see\n\n172\n00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.670\nall of the components in\nthe main Gantt chart view.\n\n173\n00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.620\nNow we can always change that to see them,\nbut\n\n174\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.490\nthe important part is that\nyou've got these three.\n\n175\n00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.510\nAnd Ronny you made a really good comment\nwhich was if you put in two of the values,\n\n176\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.100\nthe third one will be\nautomatically calculated.\n\n177\n00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.755\nBut there's some little caveats to that.\n\n178\n00:09:05.755 --> 00:09:09.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you at any point manually override\n\n179\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.235\nthe third one, it'll never do\nthe calculation again, ever.\n\n180\n00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:13.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you start to change numbers and\n\n181\n00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.690\nit won't update the formula anymore.\n\n182\n00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.050\nIt says, well, hey, you must've known.\n\n183\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What you were doing when you changed\n\n184\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.920\nthis, so\nwe're not gonna calculate it anymore.\n\n185\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.760\nSo you can break the formula.\n\n186\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.830\nThat's where you need to understand hey,\n\n187\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.140\nI'm just gonna manipulate\nthese two values and\n\n188\n00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.190\nlet this third one always be calculated\nand never go in to override that.\n\n189\n00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.310\nThe other thing is if it's effort-driven\nthen we've gotta be really\n\n190\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.582\ncareful about assigning a duration, right?\n\n191\n00:09:37.582 --> 00:09:41.460\nWith effort-driven, it looks at our\nunits and the amount of work and\n\n192\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.620\nit calculates the duration.\n\n193\n00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.550\nSo if I've got an effort driven task and\n\n194\n00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.800\nI put in the duration,\nthat's when it's supposed to calculate.\n\n195\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.100\nThat breaks the formula.\n\n196\n00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.730\nIt assumes that you\nknow what you're doing.\n\n197\n00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.080\nNow, if you do now what you're doing,\nif you know the formula, then that's fine,\n\n198\n00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.180\nit's not a problem.\n\n199\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.110\nBut if you're self-taught, if you're just\ntrying to use project, this is a headache\n\n200\n00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.311\nand you'll see people complain on\nthe Internet, all project sucks.\n\n201\n00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:04.918\n>> [LAUGH] Crazy.\n\n202\n00:10:04.918 --> 00:10:06.870\n>> I can't believe the numbers\nthat it puts on my counter.\n\n203\n00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.980\nIt's all wrong,\nwhy did they even make this?\n\n204\n00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.760\nAnd it's not project that's the problem,\n\n205\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.000\nit's that you did an override\nintentionally, and project is saying,\n\n206\n00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.040\nwell, you know better than me,\nso there you go.\n\n207\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.680\nBut if we know the formula,\nit starts to make a little more sense.\n\n208\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.010\nSo Ronnie,\nlet's take a look at this in action.\n\n209\n00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.020\n>> Let's go ahead and do that.\n\n210\n00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.970\nSo by default we'll normally see,\nif we set up a basic project,\n\n211\n00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.000\nwe'll see these normal tasks here.\n\n212\n00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.310\nTask name, duration,\nstart and resource name.\n\n213\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.450\nRemember that what we're really\nlooking at is of course the duration.\n\n214\n00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.230\nWe're looking for work and units.\n\n215\n00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.450\nUnits are gonna really be expressed\nunder here under resource name, and\n\n216\n00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.120\nduration over here, but\nnotice that work is actually missing.\n\n217\n00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.180\nSo I'm simply gonna add in a new column\nand put it right next to duration.\n\n218\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.180\nSo I'm going to select Start Date and\nthen select Insert Column and\n\n219\n00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:57.180\nfrom here I can just type in Work,\nand it'll also add Work in there too.\n\n220\n00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.158\nNow when I do that, notice it says\nthat the work hours is zero, and\n\n221\n00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:03.029\nI still have a one day duration\nwith a little question mark, and\n\n222\n00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.960\nthat's just telling me that\nthis is estimated out.\n\n223\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.180\nAnd the reason why is, I don't have\nany resources also assigned to this.\n\n224\n00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.990\nSo at this point,\nit's actually saying hey,\n\n225\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.580\nthere's no resources assigned,\nno work's gonna be accomplished.\n\n226\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.870\nBut if I click on resource name and\nthen add a resource in, just by default,\n\n227\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.730\nnotice the schedule actually selects\none of the work hours here for me.\n\n228\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.790\nNow, you might be wondering,\nwhat in the world happened there?\n\n229\n00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.640\nWell, remember that basic formula\nthat we just talked about.\n\n230\n00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.080\nIf you actually take the resource and\nthe resource at this point\n\n231\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.910\nby default's assigned 100%,\nyou do that for a single day of work for\n\n232\n00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.650\nthat individual on the standard calendar,\nwhich is eight hours of work.\n\n233\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.590\nWhen you multiply 100% of eight\nhours times one day, well,\n\n234\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.470\nthat gives you eight hours of work.\n\n235\n00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.320\nSo that seems to actually match up for\nwhat we need.\n\n236\n00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.620\nNow the problem you're\nseeing is like well,\n\n237\n00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.490\nI can't really see that\nworking in that way.\n\n238\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.060\nSo a lot of times what you wanna do is\nyou wanna switch your view a little bit\n\n239\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.350\nto give you more details so\nthat we can see this in action.\n\n240\n00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.690\nSo I'm gonna do that,\nI'm gonna click on Task, actually on View.\n\n241\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.890\nI selected the wrong one.\n\n242\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:14.620\nOn View, and then go over here to where\nit says Split View and select Details.\n\n243\n00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.840\nNow the default one that it shows\nup is what we call a task form and\n\n244\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.870\na Gantt chart.\n\n245\n00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.020\nAnd what it's gonna do is actually\njust allow me to focus in on this\n\n246\n00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.080\none task that I have and\nnotice right away,\n\n247\n00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.680\ndown here in the lower left hand corner,\nit shows me for task number one.\n\n248\n00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.810\nI have that one day duration and\nwhen I set that resource by default,\n\n249\n00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:39.060\nit set it to 100% and\nit figured out the work hours right here.\n\n250\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.630\nNow that's actually normally what we want,\nand that's perfectly fine, and\n\n251\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.790\nthat's good.\n\n252\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.470\nBut is anything gonna change if I\nselect now making it effort-driven?\n\n253\n00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.470\nWell if I click okay from there, Don,\nit doesn't look like it changes anything.\n\n254\n00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.100\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, Don,\n\n255\n00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.480\nmaybe I don't have to actually\nuse effort-driven at all.\n\n256\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.910\n>> Well, you don't if it's\njust gonna be one resource,\n\n257\n00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.410\nthen you're absolutely right,\nit doesn't make any difference.\n\n258\n00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.720\nWhere the difference comes in is,\n\n259\n00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.210\nwell there's two different changes\nthat cause the difference.\n\n260\n00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.880\nOne, if we add more resources, right?\n\n261\n00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.960\nMore people working on it.\n\n262\n00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.720\nThis is effort-driven.\n\n263\n00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.750\nWe should expect to see that time go down.\n\n264\n00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.350\nIf effort-driven is not checked and we add\nmore resources, the time stays the same.\n\n265\n00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.090\nThat duration doesn't change.\n\n266\n00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.630\nThe other thing is on the units.\n\n267\n00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.350\nThis person is set to be\n100% working on our project.\n\n268\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.660\nOn an eight hour work day that means\nwe get eight hours of work a day.\n\n269\n00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.520\nBut what if they're being\nsplit between two projects and\n\n270\n00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.950\nwe can only get them for four hours a day.\n\n271\n00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.240\nWell I would need to cut\nthe unit down to 50%.\n\n272\n00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.052\nThey're are only going to be\nworking with us 50% of the time.\n\n273\n00:13:37.052 --> 00:13:40.710\nThat's gonna reduce the amount of\nwork they can get done in the day.\n\n274\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.190\nIt's going to drop them down to four\nhours and now the duration of my\n\n275\n00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.310\nactivity is gonna take longer or\nshorter based on the change that we made.\n\n276\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.950\n>> So, if now I said after 50% and we are\nnow at that one day duration, I click OK.\n\n277\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.980\nNow notice, oh look at what happened Don.\n\n278\n00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.430\nIt actually split the work\nduration over two days instead.\n\n279\n00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.980\n>> Yep, so in this In this case\nwe have our units defined,\n\n280\n00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.030\nwe've got our work defined and\nit's calculating duration.\n\n281\n00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.950\nSo work was already defined at eight\nhours of work when that person\n\n282\n00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.580\nwas at 100% of utilization they could\ndo eight hours of work in one day.\n\n283\n00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:21.180\nBut now they're only doing 50% of their\nwork, we only get them four hours a day.\n\n284\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.760\nIf I have eight hours of work it's\ngonna take them two days to do it and\n\n285\n00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.010\nyou'll see that duration recalculated\nto two days to reflect that.\n\n286\n00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:33.380\nSo in this scenario, duration is the value\nthat's automatically being calculated for\n\n287\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.450\nus and as we manipulate our resources,\nthat's gonna happen.\n\n288\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.280\n>> Yeah, when you start seeing something\nlike this go on, that's what you have to\n\n289\n00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.760\nremember, because that's what we'll\nstart throwing you cuz you're like,\n\n290\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.380\nI didn't really do anything a lot\ndifferent, I just assumed 50%.\n\n291\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.570\nAnd you don't remember that\nthe duration then has to increase,\n\n292\n00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.290\nbecause you've just reduced them down to\nfour hours per day of actually working\n\n293\n00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.270\nbecause also effort driven.\n\n294\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.540\nSo when we start seeing that,\nhere's the default setup,\n\n295\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.580\nbecause this is also tied to what\nwe call a task type as well.\n\n296\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.670\nNow notice that under task type,\n\n297\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.940\nwe have three different\noptions that are available.\n\n298\n00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.570\nWhat we called fixed units,\nfixed duration, and fixed work two.\n\n299\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.820\nAnd that means each task can\nactually be changed in this way.\n\n300\n00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.030\nNow when you think about it,\n\n301\n00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.925\nit's not really manipulating changing\nthe task to make it something different.\n\n302\n00:15:21.925 --> 00:15:25.525\nBut what it's saying is that you actually\nwork with that formula using duration,\n\n303\n00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:28.245\nwork and units, right?\n\n304\n00:15:28.245 --> 00:15:32.905\nWhich one of these do you want to make\nsure that project does not manipulate\n\n305\n00:15:32.905 --> 00:15:35.460\nwhen it goes through and\nactually does the calculations?\n\n306\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.680\nSo if you manually set those units up,\nyou're saying Project,\n\n307\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.190\ndon't go through and change this again.\n\n308\n00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.510\nNow, can you manually\nchange it if you want to?\n\n309\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.480\nYeah, you can change it all you want.\n\n310\n00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.820\nBut you're saying Project,\nignore that one and work on the other two.\n\n311\n00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.632\nIn other words,\nyou're gonna either change the duration or\n\n312\n00:15:51.632 --> 00:15:54.396\nyou're gonna change the amount\nof work that has to be done.\n\n313\n00:15:54.396 --> 00:15:58.175\nBut you are not gonna change\nwhatever units that I assigned.\n\n314\n00:15:58.175 --> 00:16:02.685\nSo when you do that, remember that for us\nwhen we start talking about units, right?\n\n315\n00:16:02.685 --> 00:16:06.974\nWe're talking about the amount of work\nthat will be accomplished on a task\n\n316\n00:16:06.974 --> 00:16:08.420\nby a resource.\n\n317\n00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.680\nSo on a standard calendar,\n100% is equal to eight hours.\n\n318\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.590\nIf you change that, you can change those\nhours if you choose to, but just realize,\n\n319\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.540\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n320\n00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.514\nSo if you take the resource and\nyou assign them to 50%,\n\n321\n00:16:20.514 --> 00:16:21.595\nthat changes it to four hours.\n\n322\n00:16:21.595 --> 00:16:27.920\nYou assign it to 200%, that means he's\ngonna work a 16-hour day on that project.\n\n323\n00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.130\nI guess you could do that, but\n[LAUGH] but that person may reject you.\n\n324\n00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.880\n>> And you certainly could do that if\nyou're willing to pay the overtime, right?\n\n325\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.960\n>> Right.\n>> And that's how you say it.\n\n326\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.890\nThat's how you say,\n\n327\n00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:40.310\nI'm okay with paying overtime,\nI'm going to over utilize this resource.\n\n328\n00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.290\nIt happens, right?\n\n329\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.140\nIt's not an uncommon thing.\n\n330\n00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.341\nThat's where you put that exception in.\n\n331\n00:16:45.341 --> 00:16:48.730\n>> And we also have then fixed work.\n\n332\n00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:53.685\nNow if we know that something is going\nto actually be of only so much work.\n\n333\n00:16:53.685 --> 00:16:56.425\nI have 100 of these units\nthat need to be painted.\n\n334\n00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:58.945\nThose are 100 units that\nneed to be painted, and\n\n335\n00:16:58.945 --> 00:17:00.565\nthat's the amount of\nwork that may be done.\n\n336\n00:17:00.565 --> 00:17:04.505\nUsually that's scheduled in terms\nof hours for what we have to do.\n\n337\n00:17:04.505 --> 00:17:05.525\nBut remember what we're saying.\n\n338\n00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:07.725\nWe're not saying that\nyou can't change this.\n\n339\n00:17:07.725 --> 00:17:11.045\nYou can change it, but we're telling\nproject, don't change the work hours.\n\n340\n00:17:11.045 --> 00:17:12.910\nLet me change that.\n\n341\n00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.040\nAnd you just worry about units, and\n\n342\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.300\nof course the duration, when we start to\nactually change one of the other ones,\n\n343\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.640\nand that'll actually calculate\nout that third one, too.\n\n344\n00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.620\n>> Yep, and so\nthis'll be a part of your planning phase.\n\n345\n00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.170\nWhen you're in the planning\nphase of your project and\n\n346\n00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.260\nyou create that first list of activities,\nwhat a lot of people do is,\n\n347\n00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.830\nthey stop right there and they say okay,\nnow let's figure out our duration,\n\n348\n00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.000\nwhat do you estimate the duration\nis on each of these?\n\n349\n00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.030\nWhen that's not really\nwhat you should be doing.\n\n350\n00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.140\nWhat you should be doing is thinking,\n\n351\n00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.290\nall right for each of these activities,\nwhat is my fixed element?\n\n352\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.030\nDo I have a fixed number of\npeople that can work on it?\n\n353\n00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.200\nMaybe I have an activity that there's\nonly one web developer in my company\n\n354\n00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.250\nthat can work on it.\n\n355\n00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.340\nThat's gonna be that key resource.\n\n356\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.150\nRight, so I need to plan on that.\n\n357\n00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.450\nThe duration is gonna all depend\non that one person's schedule.\n\n358\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.530\nSo, I need to know it.\n\n359\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.070\nOr, is it a fixed amount of work?\n\n360\n00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.770\nI know a painting in my house\nis gonna take ten hours.\n\n361\n00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.090\nThe duration could be shorter or longer,\nbased on how many people I have working on\n\n362\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.050\nit, but\nI know that work is gonna be ten hours.\n\n363\n00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.890\nOr, maybe it is an actual duration, like\na trip, where I know it's gonna be two,\n\n364\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:17.090\nso we have to figure that out before\nwe get too far ahead in our project,\n\n365\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.420\ndefining which of those three\nis gonna be the static element.\n\n366\n00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.040\nSo of the three values that we have,\none's gonna be static.\n\n367\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.630\nOne's gonna be something that we type\nin and is never gonna change, ever.\n\n368\n00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.300\nThe second one is gonna be the one that\nwe input, the one that we manipulate.\n\n369\n00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.980\nAnd the third one is gonna be\nthe one that's calculated.\n\n370\n00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.160\nAnd it's up to us to figure out which of\nthe three falls into which of those roles.\n\n371\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.060\nBut if you don't know that's happening in\nthe background, you don't know to do that.\n\n372\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:42.770\n>> Now sometimes,\n\n373\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.742\nremember that these are not gonna turn out\nexactly the way that you expect them to,\n\n374\n00:18:46.742 --> 00:18:51.080\nBecause of something can happen when\nyou start adding in multiple resources.\n\n375\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.770\nSo I went ahead and did a reset on mine\nto show you what I'm talking about here,\n\n376\n00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.370\nwhen we have an effort driven task and\n\n377\n00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:00.310\nsometimes when things end up changing\nwhen you add in multiple resources.\n\n378\n00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.270\nSo I'm gonna change this up to\nactually giving us instead,\n\n379\n00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.710\nlet's say there's 80 hours of work for\nme to complete.\n\n380\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:11.950\nAnd when I do something like that, and\nI assign a single resource to that and\n\n381\n00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:16.500\nclick OK, notice that it actually\ngives me the 80 hours and\n\n382\n00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.840\nI did something a little bit, duration\nas 10 days which is what I wanted.\n\n383\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.750\nAnd I apparently created a new\ntask down there at the bottom.\n\n384\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.550\nThat's fine.\n\n385\n00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.580\n>> Can never have too many tasks.\n\n386\n00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.850\n>> No, no, never too many tasks here.\n\n387\n00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:33.040\nSo I've actually assigned the ten\ndays of work, 80 hours of work to do.\n\n388\n00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.685\nAnd now I'm gonna assign\na resource to that, and\n\n389\n00:19:37.685 --> 00:19:40.757\nmake sure it's effort driven.\n\n390\n00:19:40.757 --> 00:19:45.553\nAnd go to units, I guess I can\nassign 100% units here, oops.\n\n391\n00:19:45.553 --> 00:19:47.750\nAssign 100% here.\n\n392\n00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.150\nSo when we have that, we should see\nthat now I've kinda set all three,\n\n393\n00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.550\nwhich is perfectly fine,\n\n394\n00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.930\ncuz I wanna actually change a couple\nof things as we go along here.\n\n395\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.960\nThe one thing that I want to do is, let's\nsay that I want this resource number one\n\n396\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.880\nto actually go up to 200% of work,\nand click OK.\n\n397\n00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.670\nNotice that when I did that it\ncalculated the duration out, right.\n\n398\n00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.660\nSo, in this point when I selected\nfixed units I changed its units and\n\n399\n00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.190\nsaid, hey Project, don't work with this.\n\n400\n00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.930\nI already set the work hours before and\nit calculated the duration out.\n\n401\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:23.830\nSo notice by adding in the 200%\nhere on the units, it fixed it, and\n\n402\n00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.540\nthere it is, it is five days of work now.\n\n403\n00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:31.470\nNow what if I add in a second\nresource at this point?\n\n404\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:37.920\nAnd here, he's gonna be at 100%\nof the actual units that we have.\n\n405\n00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.300\nSo now I've got units and\nI've got work here at 80 hours.\n\n406\n00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.560\nI click OK.\n\n407\n00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.530\nDon, look at what happens here.\n\n408\n00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:54.290\nAll of a sudden, I thought it would be 60,\nor what would it be?\n\n409\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.450\n50 and 30 is what I thought it would be.\n\n410\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.500\nBut, Don, look.\n\n411\n00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.090\nIt doesn't-\n>> Three and a third days.\n\n412\n00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.590\nIt's kinda all over the place isn't it?\n\n413\n00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.400\n>> Yeah, I mean it is unusual\nwhat ends up happening.\n\n414\n00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.002\nAnd that is because when you start\nadding in multiple resources,\n\n415\n00:21:08.002 --> 00:21:10.450\nProject, I don't want to say\nit does something strange,\n\n416\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.810\nit does something which it\nprobably actually needs to do.\n\n417\n00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.980\nBut what happens here is\nbased on this units number.\n\n418\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:23.500\nWhen you have multiple resources, this\nis now considered the driving resource.\n\n419\n00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.610\nIn other words,\nbecause he's actually has more to do,\n\n420\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.100\nhe's actually gonna end up\ntaking up more of that schedule.\n\n421\n00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:35.420\nAnd the way that that works out is there\nis a derivative of this formula, and\n\n422\n00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.660\nit's kind of a little bit unusual.\n\n423\n00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.960\nI shouldn't say unusual here.\n\n424\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.300\nBut it is, at least to me, it didn't make\nsense until I started seeing it work.\n\n425\n00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.250\nSo you want to determine the overall work.\n\n426\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:50.100\nBecause you actually have more than\none resource, the driving resource.\n\n427\n00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.230\nWhat will happen is that they'll take\na ratio, the units of that resource,\n\n428\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.920\ndivided by the overall total units, okay.\n\n429\n00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.310\nAnd then you multiply by that 80 hours\nthere and that's what you'll get.\n\n430\n00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.798\nSo you'll notice 200% right?\n\n431\n00:22:02.798 --> 00:22:06.440\nI had 300% actually assigned as the units.\n\n432\n00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.770\nThat's two-thirds of the 80 hours, and\nthat's what you'll get when you actually\n\n433\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.580\ndo the 50.33, and\nthe result and the same thing.\n\n434\n00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.670\nThis is actually on resource number two,\nis one-third of the 80 hours that they had\n\n435\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.000\nthat was left over once the initial\nresource was also assigned too.\n\n436\n00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.060\nSo you will see some unusual numbers.\n\n437\n00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.236\nIt doesn't always end up being the nice,\nclean, and easy 10, 15, 12 hours,\n\n438\n00:22:29.236 --> 00:22:30.348\nwhatever it might be.\n\n439\n00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:34.046\nYou might end up seeing that\nit actually changes like this\n\n440\n00:22:34.046 --> 00:22:35.980\nif you're not careful here.\n\n441\n00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.350\nSo don't be surprised by\nthings like decimal points and\n\n442\n00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:45.300\nthe 3.33 days and trying to figure\nthat out in your project schedule.\n\n443\n00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.100\nProject's saying, I calculated this stuff.\n\n444\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.670\nSo you're actually starting to see\nall that stuff actually working out\n\n445\n00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.580\nbecause the way that Project\nis working in background.\n\n446\n00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.310\nAnd with multiple resources, it can really\nget hairy if you're not paying attention.\n\n447\n00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.890\n>> Well, and like Rick mentioned\nin the chat room there,\n\n448\n00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.310\nit is actually a logical way\nof looking at it though.\n\n449\n00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.140\nIf you leave it like it is right\nhere with three and a third days,\n\n450\n00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:10.460\nright, what that means is you're\ngonna have three full days of work.\n\n451\n00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.060\nAnd then on that fourth day,\n\n452\n00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.600\na third of the way through\nthe day your guys will finish.\n\n453\n00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.510\nThey'll finish their work at,\nI don't know, what is it, 10 or 11 AM.\n\n454\n00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.340\nSo they'll finish before lunchtime.\n\n455\n00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.140\nAnd that's being realistic.\n\n456\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.190\nIf they're doing the work,\nthat's when they're gonna finish, so,\n\n457\n00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.890\nnow I can schedule other activities\nto happen even that afternoon.\n\n458\n00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:31.000\nAnd so they might be working on one task\nthat morning, and in the afternoon they\n\n459\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.610\nswitch off to a different task\nbecause we've got that availability,\n\n460\n00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.380\nProject calculates that.\n\n461\n00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.089\nSo you guys hopefully get a taste here for\n\n462\n00:23:37.089 --> 00:23:39.810\nhow Microsoft Project is doing\nall this math in the background.\n\n463\n00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.625\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't have to know these\n\n464\n00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:43.050\nformulas, right?\n\n465\n00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.470\nBut if you don't know the formulas,\nvalues can change on your screen,\n\n466\n00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.890\nand you can not be sure why.\n\n467\n00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.140\nSo it's a good idea to at least be\n\n468\n00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.040\nfamiliar with what's going\non in the background.\n\n469\n00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.950\nAnd just remember my rule of thumb, the\nway that I do it is when I create a task,\n\n470\n00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:59.140\nI pick what's gonna be the task type,\nwhat's gonna be the fixed value.\n\n471\n00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.980\nAnd I put it in there, and\nI never change that again.\n\n472\n00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.280\nAnd then I pick one of the other values to\nbe the one that I modify and manipulate.\n\n473\n00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.840\nAnd the third value I let\nauto-calculate and I never change it,\n\n474\n00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.820\nI always leave it be auto-calculated.\n\n475\n00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.160\nAnd it can be hard to remember\nwhich is which, right?\n\n476\n00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.460\nCuz, Ronnie when you pull that task up,\nyou don't necessarily see which one\n\n477\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.760\nwas auto-calculated, or\nwhich one was changed by you.\n\n478\n00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.830\nAnd so,\nin an activity you can create a note.\n\n479\n00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.240\nAnd I'll usually put a note in there,\nif I've defined.\n\n480\n00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.990\nYou can look at the task type and\nyou know which one's the fixed value.\n\n481\n00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.690\nBut then which one's the one\nyou've been manipulating?\n\n482\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.770\nAnd I usually put a note in there that\nsays this is the one I'm manipulating.\n\n483\n00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.730\nAnd if I ever have to\nmanipulate that third value for\n\n484\n00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.990\nsome reason,\nI always double check the math.\n\n485\n00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:46.060\nAnd part of that's my own paranoia because\nI started with Microsoft Project 2000, and\n\n486\n00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:50.700\nback in Project 2000, boy,\nit would screw the math up all the time.\n\n487\n00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.880\nIt was in the help documentation,\nhere's how to watch out for bath math.\n\n488\n00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.580\nSo it was just so bad.\n\n489\n00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.640\nAnd that's kind of what I was trained in.\n\n490\n00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.670\nAnd in newer versions,\nit's not so bad, but\n\n491\n00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.055\nI still double check the math\nanytime I modify the third value.\n\n492\n00:25:03.055 --> 00:25:04.962\nAnd I try to not modify\nthe third value ever.\n\n493\n00:25:04.962 --> 00:25:09.425\n>> [LAUGH] You know, it's a wonderful way\nto get back in to the high school math.\n\n494\n00:25:09.425 --> 00:25:12.125\nLike somebody's mentioning\nin our chat here.\n\n495\n00:25:12.125 --> 00:25:15.535\nBut it is stuff that you've\ngot to watch out for.\n\n496\n00:25:15.535 --> 00:25:17.325\nOn that simple one task, right?\n\n497\n00:25:17.325 --> 00:25:19.945\nIt threw me for numbers cuz one,\nI'm bad at math.\n\n498\n00:25:19.945 --> 00:25:22.555\nBut now imagine if you have 100 tasks?\n\n499\n00:25:22.555 --> 00:25:26.370\nThis is where, when you're not sure,\nyou go back and you do the math.\n\n500\n00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.790\nKnowing that simple formula is\ngoing to help you out tremendously.\n\n501\n00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.570\n>> All right, well Ronnie I think that's\na pretty good run down of the formulas.\n\n502\n00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.360\nDo you have anything else\nyou want to throw in?\n\n503\n00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.210\n>> Not really.\n\n504\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.710\nJust again practice,\nunderstand the formulas.\n\n505\n00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:38.820\nBecause it's gonna help you out.\n\n506\n00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.900\nYou're probably gonna see a question or\ntwo about it on the exam.\n\n507\n00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.540\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen that's a good spot for\n\n508\n00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.650\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n509\n00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:48.570\nHope you guys enjoyed it, stay tuned\nwe got more project content coming up.\n\n510\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.780\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV I'm Don Pezet.\n\n511\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.320\n>> I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n512\n00:25:52.320 -->

--> 00:00:15.879\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.838\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:19.710\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.040\n>> It is going well today, ready for\nanother exciting day into the world of\n\n7\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.390\nMicrosoft Project, a lot of stuff for\nus to take a look at.\n\n8\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.320\n>> All right,\nnow Ronnie in our previous episodes,\n\n9\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.440\nwe talked a bit about Microsoft Project's\nAuto-Scheduling functionality and\n\n10\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.710\nhow we can link our activities together,\nand\n\n11\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.080\nProject will just automatically\nlay that out, and it works great.\n\n12\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.730\nBut there's a bit of\na limitation with that.\n\n13\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.410\nThe biggest problem with\ndoing auto-scheduling is\n\n14\n00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.480\nProject is assuming we\nhave ultimate flexibility.\n\n15\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.750\nIf somebody comes to you and\ngives you a project and says, Ronnie,\n\n16\n00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.370\nI need you to build this house.\n\n17\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.630\nI need you to start right away and\njust get done as soon as you can.\n\n18\n00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.522\nWell, if you have that kind of\nflexibility, I need to start now, but\n\n19\n00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:03.462\nthe rest of the timeline is kind of up\nto me, auto-scheduling works great.\n\n20\n00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:07.086\nBut if I've gotta series of milestones\nthat have to be set on certain dates and\n\n21\n00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:11.157\nI've gotta finish at a particular day, and\nI've gotta lot of kind of requirements and\n\n22\n00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:14.470\nconstraints, auto-scheduling\nstarts to break down a bit.\n\n23\n00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.470\nAnd it doesn't necessarily work so well.\n\n24\n00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.460\nAnd that's why it's off by default.\n\n25\n00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.640\nAnd instead,\nwe have an alternative, Ronnie?\n\n26\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.380\n>> We do, we have what we call Manual\nSchedules that we can create instead.\n\n27\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.540\nOr also what is called\nUser-Controlled Scheduling.\n\n28\n00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.370\nNow the big difference is simple.\n\n29\n00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.820\nWhen we start using that automated\nscheduling, we're depending on Microsoft\n\n30\n00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.110\nto go ahead and set up all the rest of the\ndates if we have a project start date or\n\n31\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.492\na project finish date.\n\n32\n00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:42.870\nThat it's gonna be able to calculate that\nfor us and do everything that we need to.\n\n33\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.950\nBut with a manually created schedule,\nyou are in control of every aspect\n\n34\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.250\nof the tasks that you set, and it can\ngo ahead and do some basic things once\n\n35\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.280\nyou set those dependencies to say hey,\nhere's how things fall in line.\n\n36\n00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.520\nBut it's not gonna try and\n\n37\n00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.650\nmaintain all of the different\nconnections that it needs to.\n\n38\n00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.680\nSo there are things that can\nactually be done by you.\n\n39\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.710\nAnd the problem is,\n\n40\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.908\nwith the manual scheduling, is that you\nreally need to know all the stuff that you\n\n41\n00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:10.580\nwant to actually have put in there and\nto be able to set all those dates,\n\n42\n00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.500\nall the times, everything,\nif you're gonna do something like that.\n\n43\n00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.470\nBut it doesn't mean you can't even mix and\nmatch.\n\n44\n00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.560\nYou can even do some of that as well.\n\n45\n00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.600\nSo when you do the manual scheduling,\nthat's what you're doing,\n\n46\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.530\nis you're typing in every little aspect of\nit, and then you're actually saying all\n\n47\n00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.430\nright, from this point,\nI will also put in every link.\n\n48\n00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.000\nI will also do this stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.580\nAnd then you have to make sure it\ncalculates out exactly the way that you\n\n50\n00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.600\nwant to, but I do want show you a little\nbit here in contrast of what happens\n\n51\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.840\nwhen you actually have the difference\nbetween auto and also manual scheduling.\n\n52\n00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.110\nSo on my computer, I went ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.440\nbrought up my sample project that we have\nin place, and I just turned all of these\n\n54\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.410\ntasks instead into auto-scheduling because\nI wanted to show you something right here.\n\n55\n00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.850\nI didn't really actually have to type in\nall these dates that we see over here,\n\n56\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.160\non the right-hand side,\nthe start and finish dates.\n\n57\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.400\nWith the auto-scheduling,\n\n58\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.050\nthe only thing I had to pick out\nwas that project start date.\n\n59\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.710\nOnce I picked out that project start date,\nI was now able to not ever have to worry\n\n60\n00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.800\nabout entering the start or finish dates\nat all, and Project filled it in for me.\n\n61\n00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.730\nBut if I needed to do something else and\n\n62\n00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.870\nI didn't want this automatic scheduling to\ntake over everything, notice that I have,\n\n63\n00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.170\nlet's say down here on 3.1\nInstalling Premise Cabling,\n\n64\n00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.680\nthat I didn't actually get anything\ncompleted in time that I wanted to,\n\n65\n00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.760\nsuch as the testing on my ThinClients.\n\n66\n00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.420\nIf I change one of these ThinClients\nto let's say five days here or\n\n67\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.280\nsix days, that would work, five days,\n\n68\n00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.850\nnotice that the rest of my\nschedule now was effected by it.\n\n69\n00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.790\nYou can tell by that kind of light blue or\nyou might be able to\n\n70\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.540\nnot see that on the screen, but actually\neffected the rest of the schedule.\n\n71\n00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.756\nYou could see all the dates ended up\nchanging, so that's perfectly fine,\n\n72\n00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:52.860\nbecause that's what all\nthose schedules says.\n\n73\n00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.590\nIt says, hey,\n\n74\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.790\nI need to keep everything in relationship\nto what happens when we make a change.\n\n75\n00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.462\nBut let me set that back down to two days,\nor the way that I had it before.\n\n76\n00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:08.130\nI'll just change it back, and\nnow I'm going to uncheck one of these.\n\n77\n00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.670\nSo I'm gonna select this line 29 for 3.1,\nand I'm gonna go over here to Task Mode,\n\n78\n00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.860\nand now I'm gonna choose to set\nit to Manually Scheduled instead.\n\n79\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.890\nNow, it doesn't look\nlike it changed anything.\n\n80\n00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.730\nWell, the only thing I actually said is\nthat here, I actually see a little bit\n\n81\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.100\nof an off-color three days, and\nthe start and finish dates.\n\n82\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.410\nNow I can manipulate just that information\nin there as well, and it really can effect\n\n83\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.230\nthe rest of the schedule, but what happens\nthough is the other part of the schedule.\n\n84\n00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.520\nSo if I go back here to\nthe testing that ThinClient, and\n\n85\n00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.980\nI change this back up to the five\ndays again, and I press Enter.\n\n86\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.550\nNotice that it actually didn't effect\nreally anything after that too,\n\n87\n00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.230\nso the Installing the Premise Cabling\nhere stayed at three days.\n\n88\n00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.812\nBut now notice that the rest of\nthe schedules stayed the same, and\n\n89\n00:04:56.812 --> 00:04:58.712\nthe reason why is the dependency.\n\n90\n00:04:58.712 --> 00:05:02.093\nThe rest of the schedule\ndepends now on this 3.1 and\n\n91\n00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:07.102\nactually completing and doing\neverything it needs to before we go on.\n\n92\n00:05:07.102 --> 00:05:09.080\nWhereas when we changed it before,\n\n93\n00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.610\nthe five day schedule would have\nthrown everything else off.\n\n94\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.680\nNow when we have something like that,\nthat's really the difference, so\n\n95\n00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.280\nnotice that that one change\nthere in the manual scheduling\n\n96\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.830\nreally did affect the rest\nof that calendar.\n\n97\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.590\nSo when you actually set everything in\nplace by yourself from the very beginning,\n\n98\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.220\nit means you're controlling\nthe way that that project's\n\n99\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.150\ngonna end up laying out here.\n\n100\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.087\nNow notice something else that\nalso happened with Project too.\n\n101\n00:05:34.087 --> 00:05:39.057\nOnce Project's said all right,\nI see this manual scheduling,\n\n102\n00:05:39.057 --> 00:05:43.934\nbut notice now in my finished column for\nthis line 3.1 here,\n\n103\n00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:48.004\nnotice it says Monday, August 24th, 2015.\n\n104\n00:05:48.004 --> 00:05:49.529\nIt has this red line under it,\n\n105\n00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:53.840\nand that's now saying that there is\nsome type of conflict that's going on.\n\n106\n00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.711\nIf I hover over it, it tells me that\nthere is a potential scheduling problem.\n\n107\n00:05:58.711 --> 00:06:02.920\nThe reason why we wanna see that is\nbecause sometimes that's what happens when\n\n108\n00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.790\nyou start actually introducing\nmanual scheduling or\n\n109\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.930\nuser-controlled scheduling\ninto your project as well.\n\n110\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.420\nAnd you'll probably see more\nof this if you actually do\n\n111\n00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.150\nall of these manual schedules if\nevery line was actually there.\n\n112\n00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.320\nSo it's actually trying to help us out\nby saying, you may need to adjust this.\n\n113\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.700\nThe nice thing is that it actually tells\nyou exactly what you need to do, and\n\n114\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.050\nwhen you right-click on that, it actually\ngives you two options up here at the top.\n\n115\n00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.980\nThere's some other things that we have\ndown there for the entire task, but\n\n116\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.910\nnotice it says Fix in Task Inspector.\n\n117\n00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.450\nWe're getting a notification, a warning,\n\n118\n00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.270\na message from Project that something\nis going to actually not be right.\n\n119\n00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.230\nAnd it gives us this option which\nis the Fix in Task Inspector.\n\n120\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.990\nAnd Don,\nthis is an option that I really do like\n\n121\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.800\nbecause it really helps me out if I'm\nnot exactly sure what's going on.\n\n122\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.554\nAnd over here on the left-hand side,\nit tells me on this particular task,\n\n123\n00:06:55.554 --> 00:06:59.720\nInstalling the Premise Cabling, notice\nit says look, the way that you have it,\n\n124\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.790\nonce this is done because manually\nscheduled, the task may need to be delayed\n\n125\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.476\nby three days, and I have the chance here\nto fix it in a couple of different ways.\n\n126\n00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:13.530\nI can say hey, let's just keep those links\nrespected in the way that they need to,\n\n127\n00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.340\nand it moves the task\nbased on the predecessor.\n\n128\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.940\nOr I can just say let's just\nfollow that auto-scheduling and\n\n129\n00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.290\nput everything in place that we need to.\n\n130\n00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.510\nAnd so\nthose were good options to help you.\n\n131\n00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.440\nIf you're not as familiar with Project,\n\n132\n00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.210\nin other words if you haven't\nseen something like that before,\n\n133\n00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.640\nthese are some of the actions that\nyou actually can take to help fix\n\n134\n00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.810\na scheduling problem like this, especially\nwith the manual scheduling here.\n\n135\n00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.450\nSo if I change that now to\nthe auto-schedule, you'll notice now it\n\n136\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.270\nwent ahead, and that's what happened,\nis that the rest of the project got\n\n137\n00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.440\npushed down the way that we actually\nneeded to, and now we are back into it.\n\n138\n00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.136\nSo the manual scheduling offers\na lot of different options that you\n\n139\n00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:55.294\nhave available to you, but only if\nyou're good at actually entering in all\n\n140\n00:07:55.294 --> 00:07:57.806\nthe things that you\nactually wanna enter in.\n\n141\n00:07:57.806 --> 00:08:00.457\nIf not, you're gonna see a lot of\nthose red marks and you can go,\n\n142\n00:08:00.457 --> 00:08:01.751\nwhy is everything doing that?\n\n143\n00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:03.462\nAnd you'll do like I did at times,\n\n144\n00:08:03.462 --> 00:08:07.250\nwhich is you right click on like ten of\nthem in a row and why did it affect that?\n\n145\n00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.470\nWhy did this do that?\n\n146\n00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.150\nAnd it continues to cascade down.\n\n147\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:17.000\nSo it's a great way to begin cuz that's\nprobably what you're expecting to see\n\n148\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000\nIf you're really new at project.\n\n149\n00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.670\nBut most of the time if you've been\nworking with project for a long time,\n\n150\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.825\nyou'll probably expect,\n\n151\n00:08:22.825 --> 00:08:26.050\nnow all this stuff should kind of\nshift the way that we want to.\n\n152\n00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.420\nSo most of us stick with\nthe auto scheduling when we can.\n\n153\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.210\n>> Or what I usually do is during\nthe planning phases of the project,\n\n154\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.970\nI'll use auto scheduling\nto get everything laid out.\n\n155\n00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.880\nAnd then once we're ready to baseline and\n\n156\n00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.670\nmove from planning to execution\nI convert everything to manual.\n\n157\n00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:47.350\nAnd the reason I do that is I want to make\nsure that if I make one adjustment, and\n\n158\n00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.640\nit goes to change a bunch\nof other activities,\n\n159\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.660\nI want to know exactly what's changing.\n\n160\n00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.260\nRight?\n\n161\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.110\nAnd there there's two ways\nto solve that problem.\n\n162\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.600\nOne way is my way,\nwhich is to kind of micro-manage it.\n\n163\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.290\nGo ahead and just flip it so\nthey're all manually scheduled, and\n\n164\n00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.240\nnow you can kind of go and and\nmanipulate all that by hand.\n\n165\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.990\nThe other option, though,\nis to keep auto-scheduling.\n\n166\n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.640\nAnd you've probably noticed on\nthe screen as Ronnie's done it.\n\n167\n00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.030\nIf you make a change and\n\n168\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.800\nit's a cascade effect where one change\neffects the next one, the next one, and\n\n169\n00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.930\nthe next one it'll highlight in\npurple everything that's changed.\n\n170\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.790\nI don't know if it's always purple,\nit might depend on your theme, but\n\n171\n00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.620\nin the default theme it's purple.\n\n172\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.858\nAnd it just gives you\nthat kind of visual cue.\n\n173\n00:09:24.858 --> 00:09:28.790\nSo, where Ronnie's got several\ntasks linked in a row,\n\n174\n00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.290\nif he modifies one of the early tasks,\nlike Ronnie,\n\n175\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.600\nbump up the duration or\nsomething on one of those early tasks.\n\n176\n00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.120\nAnd what you'll see is\nthe tasks that follow that\n\n177\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.950\nare gonna get moved ahead if\nthey're auto-scheduled and\n\n178\n00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.366\nit's gonna show that highlight to kinda\nlet us know that change happened.\n\n179\n00:09:43.366 --> 00:09:48.430\nAnd, oh you know on ours we've\nbroken the formula, haven't we?\n\n180\n00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.050\n>> Yeah, no, it actually is purple.\n\n181\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.000\nYou just can't see it on that screen.\n\n182\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.709\n>> Oh, [CROSSTALK]\n>> So yeah, it's actually there.\n\n183\n00:09:54.709 --> 00:09:59.010\n[LAUGH] At least, I think it's there,\nbut it does look like it.\n\n184\n00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.277\n>> Yeah,\nif you really stare at the screen.\n\n185\n00:10:00.277 --> 00:10:01.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's light purple, but\n\n186\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.680\nyou'll see where all the dates of\nthe future activities have been\n\n187\n00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.750\nhighlighted that way.\n\n188\n00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.540\nAnd that's the reason it does that.\n\n189\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.340\nIs once you understand that a change\nthat you make can be a cascading change,\n\n190\n00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.400\nand more than one thing is related,\n\n191\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.850\nmore than one thing gets affected,\nthat happens with auto scheduling.\n\n192\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.945\nWhen manually scheduled,\nbecause things are manually scheduled,\n\n193\n00:10:20.945 --> 00:10:25.055\nif I modify one activity,\nthe future ones are now overlapping.\n\n194\n00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:27.105\nAnd I've got to take them and\nmove them ahead if I want.\n\n195\n00:10:27.105 --> 00:10:29.265\nSo now I really understand\nwhich changes are happening,\n\n196\n00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:30.455\nbecause I'm the one making them.\n\n197\n00:10:30.455 --> 00:10:33.682\nSo it's kind of a choice that we have\nto make between auto schedule and\n\n198\n00:10:33.682 --> 00:10:35.042\nmanually scheduling.\n\n199\n00:10:35.042 --> 00:10:37.982\n>> You know there's a lot of different\nways, once you start getting everything in\n\n200\n00:10:37.982 --> 00:10:40.682\nplace, that things are gonna\nstart happening here.\n\n201\n00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:43.592\nSo another one that we also\nhave that auto scheduled\n\n202\n00:10:43.592 --> 00:10:47.282\nhelps us with at the beginning\nhere is setting those durations.\n\n203\n00:10:47.282 --> 00:10:51.292\nA lot of times once we set those\ndurations, those dates that follow,\n\n204\n00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:52.902\nthe dates that follow on each task,\n\n205\n00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.880\nright, they're gonna be put in\nthe place that they need to be.\n\n206\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.290\nWell the problem that we have\nthe manual scheduling is\n\n207\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.660\nthat we're probably not gonna see that.\n\n208\n00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.140\nWe have to kind of set\nthose things up in place.\n\n209\n00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.260\nOnce you get links in place they start\nfalling in line a little bit easier.\n\n210\n00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.790\nBut you may not know exactly how\nlong a task actually ends up taking.\n\n211\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.780\nSo what may have to happen is that you\ncome out with some type of estimate\n\n212\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.630\nof the duration as well.\n\n213\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.020\nAnd they talk about actually knowing how\nto do that manually a little bit too.\n\n214\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.460\nNow, inside of that when\nI started doing ADON,\n\n215\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.460\nI used that Pert analysis\nis what I ended up doing.\n\n216\n00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.740\nAnd that stands for program evaluation and\nreview technique, is what that stands for.\n\n217\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.130\nI was trying to make sure\nthat I remembered that.\n\n218\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.700\nBut this is one of the most interesting,\n\n219\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.850\nhistorical things that\nare actually out there.\n\n220\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.900\nIt was designed for\nlike submarine ballistic missile\n\n221\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.975\nprograms that were either trying to get\neverything finished up for what they did.\n\n222\n00:11:46.975 --> 00:11:50.065\nAnd the problem that they had was that\nmost of the people that were working\n\n223\n00:11:50.065 --> 00:11:52.535\ndidn't have a clue on how to estimate\n\n224\n00:11:52.535 --> 00:11:55.285\nhow long does it take to\nfinish building a submarine?\n\n225\n00:11:55.285 --> 00:11:56.045\nWell, I don't know.\n\n226\n00:11:56.045 --> 00:11:56.655\nAnd so\n\n227\n00:11:56.655 --> 00:12:00.405\nthey were able to actually use stuff\nlike that, or the entire program, right.\n\n228\n00:12:00.405 --> 00:12:01.615\nWhen multiple things were in place.\n\n229\n00:12:01.615 --> 00:12:04.035\nThey not only had the submarines\nof how to build those, but\n\n230\n00:12:04.035 --> 00:12:06.140\nalso all the different\nsystems that were in them.\n\n231\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.210\nThey needed them to start at the same\ntime, finish at the same time.\n\n232\n00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.720\nSo they came up with what they\ncalled the Pert analysis here\n\n233\n00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.860\nto really help fill in that gap.\n\n234\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.580\nAnd it worked so\n\n235\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.830\nefficiently that a lot of times you still\nsee it used today in project management.\n\n236\n00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.110\n>> Yeah,\nin the early stages of project planning,\n\n237\n00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.870\nwe have to kind of figure out what the\nduration of our activities are gonna be.\n\n238\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.490\nAnd you might start off with a complete\nand total guess not based on fact.\n\n239\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:29.025\nAll right?\n\n240\n00:12:29.025 --> 00:12:32.910\nPert is a technique we can use to try and\nget something based on fact.\n\n241\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.420\nRight?\n\n242\n00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.710\nBut let's say we're at that early,\nearly planning stage and\n\n243\n00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.900\nwe have no facts to go on at this point,\nall right?\n\n244\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.220\nAnd it's just, hey,\nwhat do you think it's gonna take?\n\n245\n00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.210\nWell, in project you can put in\na duration and flag it as an estimate.\n\n246\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.770\nIf we look at Ronnie's project notice\nhow all the durations on his project\n\n247\n00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.440\nare just a straight up number.\n\n248\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.350\nSo like task ID 25 is two days and\nit just says two days.\n\n249\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:59.820\nWell in previous versions of project,\na duration would default to an estimate.\n\n250\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.250\nIn this case it's not.\n\n251\n00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.150\nNow how do we know if it's an estimate or\nnot?\n\n252\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.300\nA question mark.\n\n253\n00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.930\nWhen you enter in two days or\ntwo weeks or two years or\n\n254\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.160\nwhatever, if you put a question mark after\nit, notice how the question mark stays.\n\n255\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.280\nAnd that's just an indicator that tells\nProject that this is an estimate and\n\n256\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.680\nnot necessarily even a good one.\n\n257\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.000\nJust an estimate that we made and\nwe kind of pulled it outta thin air.\n\n258\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.240\nSo, in the early planning\nstages you'll make up numbers.\n\n259\n00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.020\nAnd project used to default that way where\nevery activity you created the initial\n\n260\n00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.850\ndefault was just an estimate.\n\n261\n00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.360\nThen when you had it solidified you'd\ntake away that question mark and\n\n262\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.070\nyou'd change it to two days\nwith no question mark and\n\n263\n00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.570\nnow that's your indicator\nthat this is based on fact.\n\n264\n00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.200\nAll right?\n\n265\n00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.970\nWell, If we don't have any fact\nto go on we can't do that.\n\n266\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.900\nBut then as our project moves forward, we\nreach out to our subject matter experts.\n\n267\n00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.560\nWe reach out to our planners,\nour cost analysis people, and\n\n268\n00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.570\nwe start to get a better understanding.\n\n269\n00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.280\nAnd the Pert method works\non a really simple idea.\n\n270\n00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.850\nIt says, look if you just\nget a quote from one person,\n\n271\n00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.520\nyou don't know if it's good or not.\n\n272\n00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.050\nBut if you get a quote from\nthree people or six people or\n\n273\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.500\nwhatever, then we can really\nstart to get something good.\n\n274\n00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.340\nAnd Pert has a very simple formula.\n\n275\n00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.510\nLet's see if I can remember this Ronnie.\n\n276\n00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.020\n>> Here you go.\n\n277\n00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.770\n>> Oh you've actually got it.\n\n278\n00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.400\nPerfect.\n>> Right.\n\n279\n00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.540\n>> Now I don't have to remember anything.\n\n280\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.095\n>> That's right.\n\n281\n00:14:15.095 --> 00:14:16.270\n[LAUGH] Yeah when you take\n\n282\n00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.140\na look at the formula here.\nHere's kind\n\n283\n00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.085\nof the rough estimate of the formula,\nright?\n\n284\n00:14:20.085 --> 00:14:23.900\nIn the way that Pert works you take\nwhat you consider the most optimistic\n\n285\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.350\ntime that you are gonna be\nable to complete a task.\n\n286\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.960\nYou add it together with\nthe most pessimistic time.\n\n287\n00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.710\nAnd you can even talk about what\nwe call the most likely time or\n\n288\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.350\nthe expected time, and everybody uses\na little bit different terminology.\n\n289\n00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.480\nAnd you'll actually see some numbers\nthat we also added in there.\n\n290\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.250\nAnd the reason why we do that is that\nnot everything in this formula is\n\n291\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.980\nweighted equally.\n\n292\n00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.340\nSo a lot of time you can change\nthese weights if you choose to, but\n\n293\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.780\nthe standard default formula\nsays four times most likely.\n\n294\n00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.920\nIn other words their saying hey it's\ngonna be four times more likely that\n\n295\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.170\nwhen you consider that most likely\nguess is probably going to happen.\n\n296\n00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.160\nThen you take that entire formula and\nyou divide it by six.\n\n297\n00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.940\nAnd it makes sense.\n\n298\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.480\nBecause you have four here, and\none pessimistic, and one optimistic.\n\n299\n00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.690\nAnd when you do that it actually\nends up giving you a number.\n\n300\n00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.010\nAnd we are doing our\ndurations in days here.\n\n301\n00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.100\nSo we can actually use this\nformula to help us out.\n\n302\n00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.350\nIn previous versions they have\na little utility of add on.\n\n303\n00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.310\nIt was an add on wasn't it?\n\n304\n00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.420\n>> It was a little plugin.\n\n305\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.080\n>> Yeah, a little plugin that you\ncould download and add it in.\n\n306\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.990\nIt didn't work that well.\n\n307\n00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.610\nI think Don and\nI were talking about like yeah,\n\n308\n00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.330\nit used to give you some funny\nnumbers if you didn't do it right.\n\n309\n00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:33.080\nAnd so they kind of in 2013, cuz you\ndon't even find the plugin anymore for\n\n310\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.000\nyou to be able to pull that in.\n\n311\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.280\nSo there's actually other ways we can\ncome up with that if we're actually\n\n312\n00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.140\nin those initial planning stages.\n\n313\n00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.580\nNow the good thing is that means that\nwe get to use some of the tools and\n\n314\n00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.870\ntechniques that we talked\nabout a little bit earlier,\n\n315\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.380\nwhich is creating custom\nfields to help us out.\n\n316\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.597\nSo if you did do what Don was talking\nabout, as you're talking with subject\n\n317\n00:15:50.597 --> 00:15:53.468\nmatter experts you're dealing with\npeople that can help you out.\n\n318\n00:15:53.468 --> 00:15:56.277\nYou may go to one and say hey, look,\n\n319\n00:15:56.277 --> 00:16:01.626\nI need the most optimistic time that\nwe can have this task complete.\n\n320\n00:16:01.626 --> 00:16:04.418\nAnd let's say that they\ngive us three days, okay.\n\n321\n00:16:04.418 --> 00:16:06.920\nAnd then what would the longest\nperiod of time might be?\n\n322\n00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.128\nLet's say that they give us six days here,\nand most likely let's give more,\n\n323\n00:16:11.128 --> 00:16:13.170\na lot of time here to that.\n\n324\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.720\nLet's do four days.\n\n325\n00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.270\nWell notice that I have the pert estimate\nover here, and the reason why is\n\n326\n00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:24.260\nthat customized column that I made,\nI just added that formula in there,\n\n327\n00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.020\nin that custom field, so\nI selected that pert, and so there it is.\n\n328\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.510\nThis is the exact same formula\nthat I showed you on the screen\n\n329\n00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.410\nin bigger letters,\nif I could make it big here I would,\n\n330\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.160\nbut you actually were able to do that.\n\n331\n00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.600\nNow, you may not do this for everything\nand leave that in the project plan, but\n\n332\n00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.302\nat least now you can take that and\nthen go back over and\n\n333\n00:16:44.302 --> 00:16:49.040\nthen sort it into the duration if you want\nto, and that way, you actually have a nice\n\n334\n00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.170\nlittle estimate and you can actually\nhave it appear here too, and\n\n335\n00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.600\nit might help you out in your long run\nas you start planning manually for that.\n\n336\n00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.300\n>> Yeah, and just think about the kinds\nof conversations you have with a subject\n\n337\n00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:58.810\nmatter expert,\n\n338\n00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:03.260\nwhere they'll tell you, hey, best case\nscenario, we'll be done in two weeks.\n\n339\n00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.740\nNormally it takes us about for\n\n340\n00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.080\nweeks, worst case scenario it\nwill be done in six weeks, right.\n\n341\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.110\nThat's the kind of thing that you\nnormally get from people when they\n\n342\n00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.680\ngive you the feedback, and you know\nthat best case scenario, it's possible,\n\n343\n00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.030\nbut it's not very likely, and\nthat worst case scenario, well that's\n\n344\n00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.250\nusually taking into account things\nthat probably aren't going to happen.\n\n345\n00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.140\nSo the most likely is\nwhat we normally want but\n\n346\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.610\nyou don't want to ignore the most\noptimistic and the most pessimistic and\n\n347\n00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.850\nso pert does what's called\na weighted average.\n\n348\n00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.011\nIt averages them together\nto get something balanced,\n\n349\n00:17:32.011 --> 00:17:36.590\nand so looking at Irani's numbers where he\nsaid two was the most optimistic, right,\n\n350\n00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.390\nand then four was the,\nlet's bring that back up, and\n\n351\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:46.500\nfour was the most likely, or something,\nand the six was the worst, right?\n\n352\n00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.200\nSo it you look at that you would think\nthis is gonna average out to well, four,\n\n353\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.120\nif we just just average two, four and\nsix, it would average out to four.\n\n354\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.698\nBut because the weighting that we did,\nthe weighted average,\n\n355\n00:17:56.698 --> 00:17:59.871\nyou end up with a number that's a little\nbit different, and we ended up with-\n\n356\n00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:00.747\n>> I changed it with three, yeah.\n\n357\n00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:01.365\n>> Oh okay.\n>> So\n\n358\n00:18:01.365 --> 00:18:03.705\nI had three as the most\noptimistic at some point, yeah.\n\n359\n00:18:03.705 --> 00:18:06.445\n>> Okay and so you end up with 4.17 days.\n\n360\n00:18:06.445 --> 00:18:09.945\nNow, we know that it could finish\nin three days in that scenario.\n\n361\n00:18:09.945 --> 00:18:13.820\nWe know that it could finish as late as 6\ndays, but 4.17 is what we should bank on.\n\n362\n00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.130\nAnd that gives us that little\nextra security there, that extra,\n\n363\n00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.341\nwell not much, right?\n\n364\n00:18:18.341 --> 00:18:21.382\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah I didn't pick\ngreat numbers to help us out.\n\n365\n00:18:21.382 --> 00:18:22.045\n>> 17 hundredths of a day.\n\n366\n00:18:22.045 --> 00:18:23.436\n>> So yeah that was my fault, but\n\n367\n00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:26.340\nit's amazing how close that\nsomething like this can get you.\n\n368\n00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.740\nDon't take this as being the most accurate\nestimate that you'll ever get, but it\n\n369\n00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:37.050\nis something that you can at least now go\nahead and begin to base your project off.\n\n370\n00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:41.130\nAnd a lot of times you'll find it's fairly\nclose, but there are some other methods\n\n371\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.610\nthat are out there and depending on who\nyou rely on there's computer modeling,\n\n372\n00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.410\nthere's other modeling stuff that's\nout there, but overall though\n\n373\n00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.810\nit's a great way for you to at least get\nstarted with you project plan manually.\n\n374\n00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:52.890\n>> And if you haven't watched it already,\n\n375\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.990\nwe did an episode earlier in\nthe series on creating custom fields.\n\n376\n00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.570\nWhat Ronnie did is he just took four\nof the custom fields, the duration one,\n\n377\n00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.340\nduration two, duration three, duration\nfour, he just renamed duration one, two,\n\n378\n00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.200\nand three to be the optimistic estimate,\npessimistic estimate, and\n\n379\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.640\nthe most likely estimate.\n\n380\n00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.558\nAnd then for duration four he just used a\nformula, which you pulled up a second ago,\n\n381\n00:19:12.558 --> 00:19:15.685\nthat showed basically putting\nin that pert analysis.\n\n382\n00:19:15.685 --> 00:19:19.285\nSo even thought the old pert\nplugin is gone from Project 2013,\n\n383\n00:19:19.285 --> 00:19:21.015\nit doesn't mean you can't do it, right?\n\n384\n00:19:21.015 --> 00:19:23.495\nYou just use the custom fields and\nyou can generate it right there.\n\n385\n00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:26.805\nThe formula is not magic,\nit's one of the easier ones to do.\n\n386\n00:19:26.805 --> 00:19:30.245\nSo, and Ronnie, you mentioned, you might\nnot want to do this for every task, you\n\n387\n00:19:30.245 --> 00:19:34.135\nmight want to do this for every task, and\nit doesn't hurt to leave it there, too.\n\n388\n00:19:34.135 --> 00:19:39.660\nBecause at the end of the project when\nat the end of the day if you failed your\n\n389\n00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.930\nproject, right, you went over schedule,\nand you're like,\n\n390\n00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.290\nman, I didn't come in on time,\nwe were late on this project, why?\n\n391\n00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.300\nAnd we can look back and\nwe say, well on this task\n\n392\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.120\nwe thought it was gonna take six weeks,\nit actually took eight weeks.\n\n393\n00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.460\nWhy did we think it was\ngonna take six weeks?\n\n394\n00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.406\nAnd then you can just look right there and\nyou can see well,\n\n395\n00:19:57.406 --> 00:20:00.833\nthese are the estimates we got our SMEs,\nand the SMEs were wrong, or\n\n396\n00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:04.706\nthey had this worst case scenario,\nand that worst case scenario happened.\n\n397\n00:20:04.706 --> 00:20:07.655\nAnd so we tried to plan around it but\nthat happened and\n\n398\n00:20:07.655 --> 00:20:11.956\nwe didn't have enough contingency time\nin our schedule to make up for that.\n\n399\n00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:14.120\nSo it's a good way to\nkinda have accountability,\n\n400\n00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.366\nto track back where that problem started,\nwhich is useful for learning for\n\n401\n00:20:17.366 --> 00:20:20.522\nyour next project, not so useful for\nthe one you're on right now, but.\n\n402\n00:20:20.522 --> 00:20:23.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But still a good thing to have.\n\n403\n00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.008\n>> It's kind of neat when you actually\nsee this stuff starting to work out and\n\n404\n00:20:27.008 --> 00:20:30.140\nyou actually know why you\nneed it in your project plan.\n\n405\n00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.300\nSo with the manual scheduling this is\nprobably a method that we can actually use\n\n406\n00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.430\nfairly accurately to help us\nin that planning part too.\n\n407\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:42.090\nDon I think we have one more thing that we\nneed to show in the manual scheduling here\n\n408\n00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.760\nwhich is about manual summary tasks.\n\n409\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:50.372\nNow this one is not unusual but\nwhy we would choose to do this?\n\n410\n00:20:50.372 --> 00:20:53.302\nLet me go ahead and\nopen up just a new project plan here,\n\n411\n00:20:53.302 --> 00:20:56.190\nfor a blank project, and\nthat way we can get started.\n\n412\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:01.987\nSo if I were doing\nthe testing phase again,\n\n413\n00:21:01.987 --> 00:21:05.851\nand then I had, let's see,\n\n414\n00:21:05.851 --> 00:21:10.220\nTask1, Task2, and Task3.\n\n415\n00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.700\nNotice that all of the tasks by default,\n\n416\n00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.660\nright here, are actually manually\nscheduled in my project plan.\n\n417\n00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.990\nIf I select those three tasks and I\nindent them in, look at what happens Don,\n\n418\n00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:26.070\nthis is now a summary task up here at\nthe top, but it is auto scheduled, and\n\n419\n00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.270\nwhat is that actually trying to do for\nus, why is it auto scheduling?\n\n420\n00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.210\nWhat it wants to do is it wants\nto take these tasks down here and\n\n421\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:37.370\nit wants to be able to go ahead and\ncalculate those tasks up and\n\n422\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.110\nactually show us the overall duration.\n\n423\n00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.790\nAnd so it's auto scheduling and trying\nto say, I can add up all this stuff and\n\n424\n00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.320\nshow this in this one summary role.\n\n425\n00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:51.900\nBut they talk about using a manually\n\n426\n00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.360\nscheduled summary task,\nI can't say what I wanted to say there.\n\n427\n00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.740\nSo I'm gonna click on the drop down and\nselect manually scheduled at this point.\n\n428\n00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.130\nAnd there's my one day duration\n,now it is still a summary task,\n\n429\n00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.830\nwe see the little bar here.\n\n430\n00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:06.880\nAnd this time, Don,\n\n431\n00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.930\nif I do the same thing,\noh look at what's happening over here now.\n\n432\n00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.840\nWe start seeing this little red bar, and\n\n433\n00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:20.010\nnotice that this start and finish date\nDon, is still at the same date but\n\n434\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.990\nwe're starting to see some\nother information also appear.\n\n435\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.290\nSo this is actually saying, look,\nI'm not actually adding up anything, so\n\n436\n00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:32.750\nif you're gonna do this with some type\nof manual scheduled summary task,\n\n437\n00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.456\nnotice that the duration didn't change?\n\n438\n00:22:34.456 --> 00:22:35.470\nAnd it's saying, look,\n\n439\n00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:39.180\nthis is not the correct finish date for\nall these things that you have in place,\n\n440\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.080\nso it's something that allows you to\nmanually go back and set it in there.\n\n441\n00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.840\nBut if you're controlling\nthe entire project schedule,\n\n442\n00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.390\nthis may be something you want to do.\n\n443\n00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.860\n>> In the past what we\nwould use was a milestone,\n\n444\n00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.700\nyou'd put a milestone at the end of\nthe project with a date constraint on it,\n\n445\n00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.790\nif your target date was\nto finish in four days,\n\n446\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.750\nyou would just create a milestone with\na constraint that put it four days later.\n\n447\n00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:03.110\nAnd as your other activities move past it,\nyou just see that with a milestone.\n\n448\n00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.030\nBut if you do a manually\nscheduled summary task,\n\n449\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.520\nyou don't need the milestone anymore.\n\n450\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.410\nYou can see when you're moving past when\nit's supposed to finish because it's right\n\n451\n00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.720\nthere, the big red bar.\n\n452\n00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.470\nSo, it's just one less thing,\nit's designed to help kind of reduce\n\n453\n00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.360\nthe clutter of your screen a little bit\nand eliminate all those crazy milestones.\n\n454\n00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.140\nNow I'll tell you, I still use milestones\njust cuz that's what I've used for\n\n455\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.100\nyears and years and years, so it's kinda\nhard to break me of that habit, but\n\n456\n00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.220\nit is nice to have that\noption that's available.\n\n457\n00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.500\nAnd if you're doing manually scheduled\ntasks, you probably want to do a manual\n\n458\n00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.750\nsummary too just because as you\nmake a change, again, you want\n\n459\n00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.670\nto verify that you know exactly what's\nchanging and how that's affecting it.\n\n460\n00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.480\nSo I might be making one\nindividual task longer, but\n\n461\n00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.430\nnow the entire plumbing part of my\nconstruction project is gonna take longer\n\n462\n00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.355\nand I can recognize that\nimpact on the system, so.\n\n463\n00:23:46.355 --> 00:23:50.784\nYep, all things that you need to think\nabout, there really is a choice and\n\n464\n00:23:50.784 --> 00:23:55.872\nI'm sure some of you guys are wondering\nright now, well, so what do you recommend?\n\n465\n00:23:55.872 --> 00:23:58.660\nShould I do auto schedule or\nshould I do manual schedule?\n\n466\n00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.800\nAnd the reality is,\nit does come down to your preference, and\n\n467\n00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.420\nhow sensitive your data is, right?\n\n468\n00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.050\nSo, a lot of people prefer auto\nscheduling because it's easier,\n\n469\n00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.040\nthen there's people like me that prefer\nmanual scheduling because I hate it\n\n470\n00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.830\nwhen mistakes creep in that\nI don't notice, right?\n\n471\n00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.130\nNow on a project that's\nnot a high risk project,\n\n472\n00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.420\nwe might not worry about those little type\nissues that pop up with auto scheduling.\n\n473\n00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:27.020\nBut if it's a high risk project, or a high\nmoney project, you wanna be precise, and\n\n474\n00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.920\nso manually scheduling usually\nkinda becomes the victor there.\n\n475\n00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.230\nAnd you'll notice in Project if you\nfire it up, what does it default to?\n\n476\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.890\n>> Manual.\n\n477\n00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:38.320\n>> Yeah, so while auto scheduling is nice,\nit's not the default,\n\n478\n00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.250\nnow for me,\nI actually do use a mixture of both.\n\n479\n00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.120\nI think I said this earlier where when\nI'm in the early planning phases,\n\n480\n00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.850\nI'll use auto scheduling just cuz it is\nfaster to just lay things out and get that\n\n481\n00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:53.450\nproject structured, and then switch it\nover to manual and kind of run from there.\n\n482\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.711\nSo, you can certainly do a mix,\nyou can change things after the fact,\n\n483\n00:24:56.711 --> 00:24:57.940\njust be careful, right?\n\n484\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.500\nUnderstand that changing one activity is\ngonna modify everything that's linked\n\n485\n00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.420\ndown the line.\n\n486\n00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.520\n>> And that's a good thing for\nus to remember, too.\n\n487\n00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.430\nThe good thing about Project is that it\nvisually lets you know when things like\n\n488\n00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:13.170\nthis happen, and so that you can\nactually inspect what has changed or\n\n489\n00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:17.740\nwhat has gone wrong, use that task\ninspector that's also there to help you\n\n490\n00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.120\nto know exactly what's happening as well.\n\n491\n00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.970\nAnd the reason why you wanna actually do\nthat is because it's there to help you.\n\n492\n00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:28.320\nIf not, if Don were having to do this\nwith a calendar, a manual calendar and\n\n493\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.726\nhaving to write out everything, he'd have\nto actually go back every single time and\n\n494\n00:25:31.726 --> 00:25:34.160\nnot be notified, hey,\nhere's something that did change,\n\n495\n00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.640\nhere's something I need to change.\n\n496\n00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.308\nBut with Project you have all these\nvisual reminders, it's a good thing for\n\n497\n00:25:39.308 --> 00:25:40.291\nyou to take note of.\n\n498\n00:25:40.291 --> 00:25:42.996\n>> Yeah, well Ronnie, I think that's a\npretty good rundown of manual scheduling,\n\n499\n00:25:42.996 --> 00:25:44.420\ncan you think of anything\nelse to throw in?\n\n500\n00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.744\n>> I really can't, once again just think\nabout, for you, those that are actually\n\n501\n00:25:48.744 --> 00:25:53.004\npreparing for the exam, get into it every\nday cuz you're gonna need to feel that\n\n502\n00:25:53.004 --> 00:25:56.360\nyou feel comfortable and\nfamiliar with it for the exam.\n\n503\n00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.170\nSo the more often that you're working\nwith it, the better it's gonna be.\n\n504\n00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.070\n>> All right, well, ladies and\ngentlemen, that's a pretty good spot for\n\n505\n00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.380\nus to wrap this one up,\nI hope that you guys enjoyed it.\n\n506\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.880\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n507\n00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.710\n>> I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n508\n00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.585\n>> And

00:00:17.410\nAnd welcome back to another episode\nof ITProTV I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.570\nBack again with Mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.290\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.450\n>> It's going well today.\n\n7\n00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.040\nWe're ready to actually take a look\ninto the world of Microsoft Project.\n\n8\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.340\nAnd it's actually something that we've\nactually worked with quite a bit,\n\n9\n00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.960\nso excited to actually get to\nlearn some new stuff here in 2013.\n\n10\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.605\n>> Yeah.\n\n11\n00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:32.335\nYeah, what were going to be talking\nabout in this episode is managing\n\n12\n00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:33.985\nmultiple projects.\n\n13\n00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:36.755\nNow, maybe you're one of those people\nwho's fortunate enough to work in\n\n14\n00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:39.850\na company that only takes on\none project at a time and\n\n15\n00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.130\nsees it through to completion and\ndoes the job right.\n\n16\n00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.785\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the odds are you're like me and\n\n17\n00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:47.105\nyou never worked for a company like that.\n\n18\n00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:47.765\nYou've always worked for\n\n19\n00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.645\na company with ten projects going on at\nthe same time, none of which are complete.\n\n20\n00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:53.560\nThey're all just kind of moving through.\n\n21\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.100\nAnd it becomes a bit of\na coordination nightmare.\n\n22\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.990\nWell, Microsoft has a great solution to\nthat called Microsoft Project Server.\n\n23\n00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.770\nProject Server is where, instead of\nhosting our project files right here in\n\n24\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.950\nour machine, we store them up here\non a server, we can access it, and\n\n25\n00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.260\nyou can get to work, do some stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.410\nWell, I'll tell you guys right now very\nhonestly, Project Server is awesome.\n\n27\n00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.600\nIt works great.\n\n28\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.920\nBut it's pretty darn expensive.\n\n29\n00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.530\nSo, what do we do if we can't afford\nthat expensive Project Server?\n\n30\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.760\nWell, what you'll find is that\nProject Server is really designed for\n\n31\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.570\ncompanies that have more\nthan one project manager.\n\n32\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.030\nYour company might have ten projects,\nbut you're the only project manager.\n\n33\n00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.070\nAnd if that's the case, you don't\nneed a full blown Project Server.\n\n34\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.570\nYou can actually do everything you need\nright from inside of Microsoft Project.\n\n35\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.400\nMicrosoft Project on your own machine is\ncapable of managing more than one project,\n\n36\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.900\nand it's actually a pretty neat system.\n\n37\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.530\nAll right, so what we can set up is what's\ncalled, well it's actually a few different\n\n38\n00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.110\ntook here that go together to\nform this ultimate solution, but\n\n39\n00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.700\nit is all right here inside our project.\n\n40\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.970\nLet's start with the idea of\na master project, all right?\n\n41\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.350\nA master project, or sometimes people\nwill refer to this as a portfolio, but\n\n42\n00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.130\nyour master project, that's either either\njust your entire portfolio of projects for\n\n43\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.120\nyour company, or\n\n44\n00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.930\nit's a single project that's being broken\nup into multiple smaller elements.\n\n45\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.610\nAnd that happens when we do\nthings like subcontract out or\n\n46\n00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.710\njust trying to make things more granular.\n\n47\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.820\nIf we're trying to manage more than one\nproject, we can tell Microsoft Project,\n\n48\n00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.350\nhey, this is a master project and these\nother ones are sub projects underneath it.\n\n49\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.020\nAnd we can link them together so\nwe see them all at once.\n\n50\n00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.630\nSo now, as the single project manager,\nI can get in there and\n\n51\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.660\nwork and it's not a nightmare for me.\n\n52\n00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.065\nI don't have to have an IT guy\nsetting up a Project Server.\n\n53\n00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:41.100\nI don't have to pay Microsoft.\n\n54\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.700\nI think it's $25 per month per user for\nProject Server.\n\n55\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.370\nSo I think that's retail pricing,\nyour pricing might be different, but\n\n56\n00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.680\nit certainly does vary.\n\n57\n00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.130\nSo we don't necessarily have to do that.\n\n58\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.650\nWe're the only project manager,\nwe can set it up here.\n\n59\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.600\n>> Now Don, when you talk about that,\nif I have five or\n\n60\n00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.670\nsix different projects, why don't I just\nopen up a project plan for each one and\n\n61\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.720\njust leave it on the desktop and\nmanage it that way?\n\n62\n00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.930\n>> You certainly can.\n\n63\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.870\nRight, if there are five completely\nindependent projects with no overlap\n\n64\n00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.950\nwhatsoever, just manage them separate.\n\n65\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.580\nThat is the easiest solution.\n\n66\n00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.420\nBut what if I have an employee who's\ndoing work on three different projects,\n\n67\n00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.190\nand I've booked them on Monday for project\none and I'm looking at project two?\n\n68\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.940\nDo I know that employee is booked in\nproject one if I'm looking at project two?\n\n69\n00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.260\nI don't, I don't know that.\n\n70\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.060\nSo if they're separate projects, we can\nend up with some accidental overlap.\n\n71\n00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.260\nWe can over-allocate a resource and\nnot know it.\n\n72\n00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.710\nNow, if you have no shared resources, if\nyou have ten projects running at once and\n\n73\n00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.820\nit's completely independent teams and\nequipment and materials, then yes,\n\n74\n00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.460\nseparate files.\n\n75\n00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.180\nKeep it separate.\n\n76\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.290\nThat's the best solution there.\n\n77\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.660\nBut it's rare that that happens.\n\n78\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.620\nJust look at ITProTV, right, we've got\nall these different projects that go on\n\n79\n00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.870\nhere and I can guarantee you that there's\npeople, like Ronnie, who's on every single\n\n80\n00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.360\none of those projects, and so it causes\na lot of tracking issues, really.\n\n81\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.060\nSo linking the projects\ntogether helps to solve that,\n\n82\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.710\nhelps to work around it where\nwe might have a project for\n\n83\n00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.090\ndeploying a website and another\nproject for building a virtual lab.\n\n84\n00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.610\nAnd they might seem separate,\nbut there might be some\n\n85\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.190\nfeature that's being introduced on the\nwebsite that this new virtual lab needs.\n\n86\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.460\nAnd so now the virtual lab becomes\ndependent on the website project.\n\n87\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.900\nIt's not the same people doing the work,\n\n88\n00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.170\nit's just kind of a timing\nof feature release.\n\n89\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.840\nOr we want to have two unrelated projects\nthat we decide to combine because there's\n\n90\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.730\nsome element they can share.\n\n91\n00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.290\nMaybe project one needs to rent a truck,\nand\n\n92\n00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.860\nproject two needs to rent a truck also.\n\n93\n00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.860\nBut they only need it for two hours.\n\n94\n00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.370\nBut we find that if we combine those two,\nwe can rent a truck and use it half\n\n95\n00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.720\nthe day on one project and half the day on\nthe other project, and save some money.\n\n96\n00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.920\nNow these two independent projects become\nlinked by this shared resource, and\n\n97\n00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.010\nso those are all scenarios when we need\nto have a better vision of that and\n\n98\n00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.210\nProject will let us do that.\n\n99\n00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.910\nYou can manage more than one project\nfrom inside of Microsoft Project.\n\n100\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.590\nAll right,\nlet me show you the first technique.\n\n101\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.280\nThe first technique is to basically\nlink in an external project into yours.\n\n102\n00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.570\nWe can convert any project here in\nMicrosoft Project into a master project.\n\n103\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.530\nHere, for example,\nI've got this construction project.\n\n104\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.580\nSo we're building a house.\n\n105\n00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.690\nSo we've got all this stuff laid out and\nthese are all the things, maybe I work for\n\n106\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.980\na general contractor.\n\n107\n00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.550\nAnd so this is all the work that\nI can do as a general contractor.\n\n108\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.320\nWe can do some carpentry,\n\n109\n00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.268\nroofing, put in some elevators,\napparently it's a big house.\n\n110\n00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:37.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe an office building then.\n\n111\n00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.260\nSo we can put in all this stuff.\n\n112\n00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.290\nThese are the things that we can do.\n\n113\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.720\nBut there's other things that we need\nto contract out, like the plumbing and\n\n114\n00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.650\nelectric, the masonry work,\nwe decide we're gonna contract those out.\n\n115\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.920\nAnd so that contractor, you know,\nmaybe I have a sub-project manager,\n\n116\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.540\nit's somebody who's gonna be handling\njust the electric, or just the HVAC, and\n\n117\n00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.020\nso I wanna create a separate project\nfile for that and just link it in here.\n\n118\n00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.060\nAll right and so that's,\n\n119\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.460\nthat's exactly what I've done is I've\ncreated this construction project, and\n\n120\n00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.780\nthan I've created separated projects for\neach of these other sub-projects.\n\n121\n00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.190\nAnd I might have a sub-project\nmanager dedicated to each one, or\n\n122\n00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.130\nit might just be me managing them and\nI broken them out here to create a,\n\n123\n00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.000\nyou know it's just a little\nmore simpler for me.\n\n124\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.580\nSo if I want to look at my masonry work,\nI can pull that up and\n\n125\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.590\nnow here I am in the masonry project.\n\n126\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.690\nAnd so\nI can see here's the foundation work for\n\n127\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.160\nlaying the foundation of the building,\nhere's form and pour concrete,\n\n128\n00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.815\nto actually get that done, and then the\nfinal masonry work which is things like\n\n129\n00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:38.265\nputting grout work in for\ntile and stuff, right?\n\n130\n00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:42.155\nSo this is all the cement stuff that's\ngonna happen inside of my project,\n\n131\n00:06:42.155 --> 00:06:43.435\nall right?\n\n132\n00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:45.575\nNow I've gotta separate it out here so\nit's easier to work with.\n\n133\n00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:47.430\nIt's a smaller chunk of the project.\n\n134\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.230\nBut, this stuff is gonna happen\ninside of my other project, right?\n\n135\n00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.770\nSo, I can jump back over to\nmy other project, right here.\n\n136\n00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.710\nWhat's gonna be my master project.\n\n137\n00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.300\nRight now it's just a normal project,\nright.\n\n138\n00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.460\nI can come down and\npick an empty line down here and\n\n139\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.570\nup top, if you got to your Project tab,\nyou'll see the sub Project link, and\n\n140\n00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.560\nI can click sub project and\nI can pick another project file.\n\n141\n00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.690\nSo I'm gonna pick that masonry project.\n\n142\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.196\nAnd when I insert it, see what it did?\n\n143\n00:07:17.196 --> 00:07:22.854\nIt added that construction project and\nI'm gonna just kind of un-indent that one.\n\n144\n00:07:22.854 --> 00:07:24.490\nOh, good, it's already all the way up.\n\n145\n00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.490\nSorry, I thought it was indented but it's\njust that little arrow that was doing it.\n\n146\n00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.470\nSo I've got that construction\nproject right there, and\n\n147\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.050\nit's set up to be 100 days long, and\nif I expand it out inside of there,\n\n148\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.550\nI can see my foundation, my form and\npour concrete, my masonry work.\n\n149\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.490\nThere's all of those activities, and I\nnow see them inside of my master project.\n\n150\n00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.990\nNow this gives me a couple\nof different big advantages.\n\n151\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.974\nThe first advantage is I can now\nsee when I have overlapping tasks.\n\n152\n00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:59.290\nMaybe I'm gonna be scheduling work\non Monday, September 27th and yeah.\n\n153\n00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.850\nMonday, September 27th.\n\n154\n00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.780\nAnd so I look down here and I can see\nmy stuff that's going on that day.\n\n155\n00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.960\nAnd I can scroll down here and\n\n156\n00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.250\nI can see the masonry stuff\nthat's going on that day.\n\n157\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.920\nSo now I get visibility\ninto these other projects.\n\n158\n00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.660\nSo even if it's an unrelated project,\nI might shrink that one down.\n\n159\n00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.620\nActually let me rename,\noh it's already named.\n\n160\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.220\nGood, my column's just not wide enough for\nme to see the name.\n\n161\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.580\nLet me stretch that out to\navoid confusion, there.\n\n162\n00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.820\nSo I can see the masonry project.\n\n163\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.610\nAnd I can see it in my project schedule.\n\n164\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.950\nI get that visibility.\n\n165\n00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.550\nAnd I can even continue on\nto link those other ones.\n\n166\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.470\nSo if I keep going back\nhere to sub-project.\n\n167\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.610\nAnd I take electrical and\nHVAC and plumbing.\n\n168\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.660\nAnd bring all those guys in.\n\n169\n00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.010\nNow when I look at the calendar,\n\n170\n00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.290\nI'm gonna see all of those activities,\nnot just mine.\n\n171\n00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.050\nOkay.\n\n172\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.310\nBut even though I'm\ncalling them sub-projects,\n\n173\n00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.410\nthey're still technically not\nrelated to what's going on up here.\n\n174\n00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.330\nSure, there might be overlap, but there's\nnot a true relationship between them.\n\n175\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.300\nWell, the second advantage to linking\nthem, visibility was the first advantage,\n\n176\n00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:08.310\nthe second ability is we can create\ndependencies between these activities.\n\n177\n00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.660\nWatch what I mean.\n\n178\n00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.920\nDown here,\nunder construction project masonry,\n\n179\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.140\nI've got laying the foundation for the\nbuilding and forming and pouring concrete.\n\n180\n00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.340\nI know that all that has to\nhappen before I can put walls up.\n\n181\n00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.680\nAnd if you look up here,\n\n182\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.880\nI've got this project section\nhere called Steel Erection.\n\n183\n00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.300\nAnd that is gonna be\nputting up those walls.\n\n184\n00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.850\nRight?\n\n185\n00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.720\nAnd right before that,\nI've got Site Grading and Utilities.\n\n186\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.020\nThat's where they level the land\nbefore you put a foundation.\n\n187\n00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.420\nSo my foundation work needs to\nhappen in between these two guys.\n\n188\n00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.180\nRight?\n\n189\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.310\nSo what I can do is I can\ntake Site Grading and\n\n190\n00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.760\nUtilities and I've got a choice here.\n\n191\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.710\nI can link this entire roll up task or\nI can just come in here and\n\n192\n00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:58.430\npick the very last entry inside of it,\nif I can click on that arrow to expand it.\n\n193\n00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.340\nSo I can take all these guys and\n\n194\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.310\nsee how this last one right here is\nerect building batter boards and\n\n195\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:08.760\nlayout really, I guess right here\nafter perform final site grading.\n\n196\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.510\nOnce that's done, now we're ready\nto lay some of that cement.\n\n197\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.170\nSo I can take this activity and I'm just\ngoing to highlight it and I'm going to\n\n198\n00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:20.260\nscroll down here to foundation and get to\nthis excavate foundations alright, and\n\n199\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.540\nI'll just hold control and\nhighlight that one too.\n\n200\n00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.850\nSo I've got the activity in my\nmaster project highlighted and\n\n201\n00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.810\nnow I've got this activity in\nthe sub project highlighted.\n\n202\n00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.980\nNow when I go to task I can\nlink those together and\n\n203\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.810\nit creates a link between my master\nproject and that sub project.\n\n204\n00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:42.840\nNow when that's done,\nwe can move on to excavate foundation and\n\n205\n00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.760\nthen start to move through all of these.\n\n206\n00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.250\nAnd if you're auto scheduling,\n\n207\n00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.100\nyou'll see this jump forward in time\nto start kind of laying that out.\n\n208\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.140\nAnd then when the foundation is done,\nand we've got prepare and pour concrete,\n\n209\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.380\nthen the next thing would be to\nform the second floor alright, so I\n\n210\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.110\nam going to hold control and hit that and\nI am linking within that other project.\n\n211\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.690\nHere I am working in\nthat other project file.\n\n212\n00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.110\nAnd when the second floor is done and\n\n213\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.900\nwe get down to this strip forms from\nfirst floor slab and that's done.\n\n214\n00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:17.150\nNow we can go back up here and now we're\nready to move on to steel erections.\n\n215\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.500\nWe'll come in here and choose that one,\nand I am gonna link there.\n\n216\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.120\nWoops, I highlighted two things at once.\n\n217\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.050\nLet me fix that real quick.\n\n218\n00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:31.450\nSo let me go back and redo this and so\nI'm gonna take that strip forms and\n\n219\n00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.992\nthen I'll go back up here and\npick inside of steel and\n\n220\n00:11:35.992 --> 00:11:40.960\nwe'll link that one and now it's starting\nto lay that out in a chronological\n\n221\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.330\norder and you can see this gap in between.\n\n222\n00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.640\nYou know these two used to\nbe right after each other.\n\n223\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.450\nNow there's this big gap right here.\n\n224\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.980\nWhat's in that gap?\n\n225\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.390\nAll the foundation work down here.\n\n226\n00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.540\nThat's all in that gap\nthat's taking place.\n\n227\n00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.400\nSo now I've got these links\nbetween the master project and\n\n228\n00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.880\nthis sub project and you can link as\nmany projects as you want like this.\n\n229\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.550\nAnd the neat part is I didn't technically\nhave to link these as sub projects,\n\n230\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.220\nI could have just had them\nas files on the hard drive.\n\n231\n00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.950\nIf I go to my predecessors column here,\n\n232\n00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:14.585\nnotice the predecessors column for\none of these that's linked between files.\n\n233\n00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:20.385\nInstead of having just a task number,\nit actually has the full file name.\n\n234\n00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:23.185\nSo it's saying look in\nmy documents folder for\n\n235\n00:12:23.185 --> 00:12:27.145\na file called Construction-Project and\nlink this to task 29.\n\n236\n00:12:27.145 --> 00:12:28.535\nRight?\n\n237\n00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:32.795\nSo, I can link to a file if I\njust knew where the file was, and\n\n238\n00:12:32.795 --> 00:12:36.280\nnot have to actually add it as\na sub project to my screen.\n\n239\n00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.320\nYou normally do wanna add as a sub project\nso it will show up in your calendar.\n\n240\n00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.300\nBut you don't have to.\n\n241\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.870\nJust be aware that that is a hard link.\n\n242\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.580\nSo if I take this project file and\nI copy it somewhere else on my hard drive,\n\n243\n00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.850\nit's gonna break those links, right?\n\n244\n00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.720\nBut once it's defined it's in there.\n\n245\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.890\nIt's pointed in that location.\n\n246\n00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.990\nI'll normally stick it on a network drive,\njust like map to a drive letter.\n\n247\n00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.910\nAnd that way it'll be\naccessible everywhere, but\n\n248\n00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.140\nnow it's linked and we've got a master\nproject with a sub project underneath it.\n\n249\n00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.500\nAnd I would just need to go and\nlink all of my other ones,\n\n250\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.710\nI'm not gonna worry you guys to\ndeath by linking the other ones but\n\n251\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.580\nI would just need to go through and\nlink each of the other ones here so\n\n252\n00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.750\nthey were participating as\npart of that master project.\n\n253\n00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.520\n>> That's really a handy tool.\n\n254\n00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.470\nTo be able to actually manage all\nof those different projects, or\n\n255\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.760\nat least see where they're\nscheduled in line.\n\n256\n00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.470\nBut Don, earlier you were also talking\nabout the fact of what we call shared\n\n257\n00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.100\nresources, that you may have one\nindividual that may be working on multiple\n\n258\n00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.550\nparts of this project, but they're\nfrom different project plans Don, so\n\n259\n00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.870\nhow do we actually get that to work?\n\n260\n00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.410\n>> All right,\nI'm glad you mentioned it Ronnie,\n\n261\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.800\nbecause it's a problem I'm gonna have\nright here in this project right now.\n\n262\n00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:44.000\nI might have in the Electrical Project\nhere, right under this separate project.\n\n263\n00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.380\nI might have a resource who's,\nyou know, John Smith.\n\n264\n00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.090\nAnd John Smith is an electrician.\n\n265\n00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.070\nAnd so\nI've got him added into this project and\n\n266\n00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.270\nI'm assigning him to activities.\n\n267\n00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:58.460\nWell John Smith might also be\na resource of my Master Project and\n\n268\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.660\nI'm assigning him to activities there.\n\n269\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.740\nAnd John Smith might be\na part of the HVAC, right?\n\n270\n00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.790\nCuz if you're gonna put in\nair conditioning you've\n\n271\n00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.120\ngotta get power for those.\n\n272\n00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.060\nSo John Smith might be there too.\n\n273\n00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.790\nWell, Project see's these as\nfive separate projects and\n\n274\n00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.880\nit assumes that they\nare different John Smith's.\n\n275\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.790\nIt doesn't know that there\nis only one John Smith and\n\n276\n00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.210\nhe's doing all this\nwork across my project.\n\n277\n00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.890\nIt thinks I have more than one John Smith.\n\n278\n00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.740\nSo if your going to be managing\nmultiple projects like this, we have to\n\n279\n00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.220\nhave some way to let Project know that\nthere's not more than one John Smith,\n\n280\n00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.120\nI just have one, there's a single guy, and\nhe's doing work on more than one project.\n\n281\n00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.960\nNow, that's something that\nProject server does by default.\n\n282\n00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.385\nSo, if you've got that infrastructure,\nyou create this pool of resources that\n\n283\n00:14:43.385 --> 00:14:46.805\nare available and stored there on the\nserver and all your projects share it, but\n\n284\n00:14:46.805 --> 00:14:50.115\nwhen you're running Project on your\ndesktop like this you don't have that.\n\n285\n00:14:50.115 --> 00:14:54.780\nSo what you need to do is\ncreate your own resource pool.\n\n286\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.880\nAnd resource pools,\nthey sound incredibly complex.\n\n287\n00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.970\nBut they're actually\nreally easy to implement.\n\n288\n00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.040\nIt's just a listing of\nall of your resources.\n\n289\n00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.750\nAnd that's employees, material, and\n\n290\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.650\nequipment, that all of\nyour projects then share.\n\n291\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.880\nAnd by them sharing it,\nthey know there's only one John Smith.\n\n292\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.510\nAnd they know if John is already booked\nfor another project on a certain day,\n\n293\n00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.380\neven if they're not linked to that\nother project, because the resource\n\n294\n00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.500\npool is sharing that information\nbetween all of your different projects.\n\n295\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.320\nIt's a great technique, and\nit's a feature of Project Professional.\n\n296\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.620\nSo if you have the Project Standard,\nit won't connect to a pool, but\n\n297\n00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.840\nif you have Project Professional, it will.\n\n298\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.980\nIt's one of the reasons why you\nmight wanna pay a little extra for\n\n299\n00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.260\nthat Professional version.\n\n300\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.850\nBut it's a pretty easy thing to do.\n\n301\n00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.210\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n302\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.570\nWell, step one,\nI need to figure out who my resources are.\n\n303\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:45.370\nWell, here inside of my Master Project,\nI've got my resource sheet, so\n\n304\n00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.430\nI'm just going to switch over to\nmy resource sheet real quick, and\n\n305\n00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.610\nyou'll see the list of\nresources that I have.\n\n306\n00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.738\nOkay, now it's listing all\nof these resources out.\n\n307\n00:15:53.738 --> 00:15:55.600\nAnd if you look kind of\ndown the line on these,\n\n308\n00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.158\nit's just kind of listing them out and\nit's got their names.\n\n309\n00:15:58.158 --> 00:16:01.790\nAnd I've got generic names assigned to\nmine, right, so Elevator Contractor.\n\n310\n00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.102\nI don't necessarily have like, John Smith.\n\n311\n00:16:04.102 --> 00:16:07.761\nBut notice the numbering on the left side,\nhere.\n\n312\n00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:10.888\nSo, I've got like one all\nthe way through 32 and\n\n313\n00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:14.200\nalso I've got one through ten down here.\n\n314\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.600\nWhat's that all about?\n\n315\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.450\nWell, it's actually listing\nresources from some of the different\n\n316\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.550\nprojects that I've got open.\n\n317\n00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.130\nI've got more than one project open,\nand so\n\n318\n00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.300\nI'm starting to see some of those, I'm\nalready probably getting some duplication.\n\n319\n00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.560\nLet's see,\ndo I have any duplication in here?\n\n320\n00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.150\nYeah.\n\n321\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:33.080\nSo here, I've got this G.C. Rough\nCarpenter Crew, is my number 8 up here.\n\n322\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:39.060\nAnd if I scroll down, I've got G.C. Rough\nCarpenter Crew as my number 2 right here.\n\n323\n00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.460\nThat means, I've used G.C. Rough Carpenter\nCrew in more than one project, and\n\n324\n00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.300\nso it's showing up here more than once\nas a multiple resource, all right.\n\n325\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.980\nSo I need to create a pool\nthat fixes that for me.\n\n326\n00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.020\nMakes it to where I don't\nhave these duplicates.\n\n327\n00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.090\nAnd so what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna come over here and\n\n328\n00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.220\nI'm gonna highlight my resources.\n\n329\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.330\nAnd again this could be people, could\nbe equipment, these could be tractors,\n\n330\n00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.800\nit could be lumber,\nit could be any number of things.\n\n331\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.090\nComputers, laptops, projects,\nyou name it but normally it's people.\n\n332\n00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.552\nSo I'm gonna copy those so\nI've got a list of my resources.\n\n333\n00:17:11.552 --> 00:17:14.570\nAnd I want this list not to\nhave duplicates in it, so\n\n334\n00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.800\nif I kind of excluded\nthese guys down here.\n\n335\n00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.160\nThat's because I knew that they\nwere duplicates from up here.\n\n336\n00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.350\nSo, get a list of your resources.\n\n337\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:29.000\nThat doesn't contain duplicates, and\nthen create an all new project file.\n\n338\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.200\nSo I'm just going to do a Ctrl+N to\nwhip up a new project file here.\n\n339\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.015\nAnd what we want to do is we wanna create\na project that is completely empty.\n\n340\n00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:42.430\nNo activities, no scheduled activities,\nnone of that stuff.\n\n341\n00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.760\nNo Gantt charts, or network diagrams or\n\n342\n00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.810\nanything, all we want\nin here are resources.\n\n343\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.530\nAnd so in this project I'm just gonna\njump right to my Resource Sheet, and\n\n344\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.880\nI'm gonna paste in all those\nresources that I just copied.\n\n345\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.790\nOkay, so here they are.\n\n346\n00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.970\nAnd then I'm gonna make sure this\nis sorted by resource name just so\n\n347\n00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.930\nI can double check to make\nsure there's no duplicates.\n\n348\n00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.840\nSo I'm just gonna scan\ndown the line here and\n\n349\n00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.780\nlook to see if I can spot any duplicates.\n\n350\n00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.820\nIf there were duplicates, if you sort\nby name you'll spot them real fast.\n\n351\n00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.200\nAnd so I can just scan down that line and\nlooks like we are pretty safe here.\n\n352\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.560\nYou know,\nthat didn't really alphabetize, did it?\n\n353\n00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.990\nMaybe Microsoft is using a different\nalphabet these days than what I'm used to.\n\n354\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.150\nThere we go.\nAll right, so yeah.\n\n355\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.920\nWell, so I just sorted it alphabetically.\n\n356\n00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.140\nIf you hit the drop down area\nyou can just sort A to Z,\n\n357\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.590\nwhich it's supposed to do\nwhen you just click the bar.\n\n358\n00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.520\nThat didn't happen for me.\n\n359\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.292\nBut yeah, so I'll just scan down\nthe line and look for any duplicates and\n\n360\n00:18:38.292 --> 00:18:40.580\nif I find a duplicate,\nI'll just delete them out of there.\n\n361\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.140\nBecause these resources aren't\nactually linked to anywhere, right?\n\n362\n00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.600\nThis is just right here in\nthis one empty project.\n\n363\n00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.210\nBut it looks good.\n\n364\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.220\nI don't see any duplicates off-hand.\n\n365\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.510\nSo now I'm gonna save this project.\n\n366\n00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.690\nAll right now, when you save the project,\n\n367\n00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.410\nit's just saving this\nresource sheet basically.\n\n368\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.220\nThe rest of the project is empty.\n\n369\n00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.800\nThat's fine, it's exactly what I want.\n\n370\n00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.470\nSo I am gonna call this my Resource Pool.\n\n371\n00:19:05.455 --> 00:19:09.545\nSo that project file is now gonna\nserve as the resource pool.\n\n372\n00:19:09.545 --> 00:19:14.851\nAnd I can go to my other projects and\nI can link them to this pool.\n\n373\n00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:17.453\nThe tricky part here is in\norder to link to a pool,\n\n374\n00:19:17.453 --> 00:19:21.497\nyou have to have the pool open at\nthe same time as your main project.\n\n375\n00:19:21.497 --> 00:19:24.327\nSo what I need to do is\nI need to take this and\n\n376\n00:19:24.327 --> 00:19:28.437\nthere's this little Restore button up here\nin the corner, we usually overlook it.\n\n377\n00:19:28.437 --> 00:19:32.767\nBut it lets me drop that\nproject into a window and\n\n378\n00:19:32.767 --> 00:19:36.280\nnow I can have more than one project\non my screen at the same time.\n\n379\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.390\nAnd so here on the left I\nsee my construction project.\n\n380\n00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.780\nAnd on the right I see my resource pool,\nright?\n\n381\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.440\nSo I've got these both\nopen at the same time.\n\n382\n00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:49.390\nAnd when that happens,\nwe can go to our construction project and\n\n383\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:53.340\nunder Resource,\nyou'll see the Resource Pool option.\n\n384\n00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.900\nAnd you can choose that and\nchoose to share resources, and\n\n385\n00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.080\nfrom here we can tell it where we\nare going to get our resources from.\n\n386\n00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:06.340\nIf we are the pool, you will say use\nyour own resources, but if you are not\n\n387\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.370\nthe pool you will choose to use resources\nfrom someone else and you will pick it.\n\n388\n00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.520\nNow notice how I only have one\noption here, resource pool, and\n\n389\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.710\nI can't change it.\n\n390\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.550\nIf I had more than one project open, I'd\nhave to tell it which one was the pool.\n\n391\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.420\nI called mine Resource Pool,\nyou can call it whatever you want.\n\n392\n00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.070\nYou can call it Human Resources.\n\n393\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.930\nCall it Employees,\nit doesn't matter right?\n\n394\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.820\nI just called it Resource Pool so\nI could remember.\n\n395\n00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.020\nAnd then down here,\nwhat happens if there is a conflict?\n\n396\n00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.430\nIf I have an employee who is booked in two\ndifferent projects at the same time, or\n\n397\n00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.820\nif there is a conflict where\nJohn Smith exists in the pool and\n\n398\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.590\nhe exists in my project.\n\n399\n00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.380\nWhich one wins?\n\n400\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.500\nWhich one becomes the final resource?\n\n401\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.350\nAnd you can choose for\nthe pool to take precedence or the sharer,\n\n402\n00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.490\nwhich in this case would\nbe my main project.\n\n403\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.660\nBecause I copied mine right over,\nthey're the same so\n\n404\n00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.930\nI'm just gonna let the pool take place.\n\n405\n00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.480\nIt doesn't really matter for me.\n\n406\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.180\nIn real life land,\nit depends on how accurate your data is.\n\n407\n00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.820\nIf the data's identical,\nthen it doesn't matter which one you pick.\n\n408\n00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.670\nRight, you usually pick the pool.\n\n409\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.670\nBut if you just copied names to the pool,\nand\n\n410\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:11.520\ndidn't copy things like their pay rate and\nschedules and\n\n411\n00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.290\nstuff, then you might want sharer to\ntake precedence and have that come in.\n\n412\n00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.880\nBut you normally want the pool,\nthat's what's gonna create that stable,\n\n413\n00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.509\nsingle location.\n\n414\n00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.910\nAnd when I say OK,\nsomething interesting is gonna happen.\n\n415\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.450\nOver here in my construction project,\n\n416\n00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.360\nI'm still gonna see,\nall my resources just like normal.\n\n417\n00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.200\nThere's all my resources.\n\n418\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:37.540\nAnd if I go to my Gantt chart,\nI can assign resources just like normal,\n\n419\n00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.620\nthings aren't gonna look any different\nhere, things work just like normal.\n\n420\n00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:46.500\nBut what's different is when I\nassign somebody a task here,\n\n421\n00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.410\nin the background, it's copying\nthat to the resource over here.\n\n422\n00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.120\nAnd so\nnow I am going to have one project that\n\n423\n00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.070\nis like a central calendar that\nshows people's availability.\n\n424\n00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.930\nAnd whenever I schedule\nsomebody in my master project,\n\n425\n00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.850\nit is going to look to that pool and say\nis this person available on this day or\n\n426\n00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.530\nam I about to over allocate them.\n\n427\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.910\nI am now going to get availability\nbetween all my projects.\n\n428\n00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.000\nAnd all I have to do,\nyou do have to do this for\n\n429\n00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.400\neach project,\nI do need to open my other projects, and\n\n430\n00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.590\nmake sure that I set them to use\nthe resource pool and save them.\n\n431\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:26.820\nAnd so, here it's, because I've done the\nlinking, it gets a little bit weird here.\n\n432\n00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.320\nBut, I'm gonna go ahead and save my\nconstruction project, and get that saved.\n\n433\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.920\nBut what I like to do just to\nbe on the safe side is open each\n\n434\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.760\nproject individually and just double check\nto make sure they're set to use that pool.\n\n435\n00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.660\nIn the future you could create a template\nthat was already linked to the pool,\n\n436\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.850\nand that way when you create new projects\nthey would all be using the resource pool\n\n437\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:46.710\nall ready.\n\n438\n00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.110\nBut basically, if you just go in and\nopen each of your projects, so\n\n439\n00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.280\nI could take electrical,\nI'll fire that one up.\n\n440\n00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.630\nAnd I'll go to Resource > Resource\npool > Share resources and\n\n441\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.120\nI'm gonna tell it to use the resources\nfrom that resource pool.\n\n442\n00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.670\nPool takes precedence, right?\n\n443\n00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.650\nSo now it's set and see how that\nperson just became over allocated?\n\n444\n00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.880\nThey weren't over allocated a second ago,\nnow they are.\n\n445\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.000\nWhat happened?\n\n446\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.780\nWell, it looked in the pool and\n\n447\n00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.980\nit saw where that person is assigned\na task in a different project, and\n\n448\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.110\nnow we've got an overlap, and now I can\nsee that because we got a resource pool.\n\n449\n00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.410\nVery, very powerful.\n\n450\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.760\nThis is all stuff that Microsoft Project\nserver does for you, too, but\n\n451\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.120\nnotice that I don't have\na project server here.\n\n452\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:29.730\nI just did this.\n\n453\n00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:30.430\nIt was super easy.\n\n454\n00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.360\nIt was right here on this machine.\n\n455\n00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.100\nThat really is hand,\nif you're the only project manager, or\n\n456\n00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.810\nyou know if you just have one or\ntwo project managers, and\n\n457\n00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.820\nyou don't want that whole\nserver infrastructure.\n\n458\n00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.250\nI'm just gonna make sure I save that,\nand I would just go through and\n\n459\n00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.980\ndo that for each of my existing projects.\n\n460\n00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.268\nAnd in the future we'd set\nthat up ahead of time, but\n\n461\n00:23:46.268 --> 00:23:48.403\nnow we get that visibility\nbetween our systems.\n\n462\n00:23:48.403 --> 00:23:52.243\n>> Now this is a really nice resource\nbecause we do have a limited amount of\n\n463\n00:23:52.243 --> 00:23:56.428\nresources, and we tend to work on them\non multiple projects in one company.\n\n464\n00:23:56.428 --> 00:23:59.990\nThe other best practice of\nusing a resource pool, as well,\n\n465\n00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:05.360\nIs that they recommend that you take that\nresource pool and open it as read only.\n\n466\n00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.390\nSo, that way, whatever you actually set,\nsomebody doesn't come behind you and\n\n467\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:09.580\nactually change those resources.\n\n468\n00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.570\nIn other words, knock one person off of\na project and then say hey, I don't care.\n\n469\n00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.310\nYou know, Don set it first,\nRonnie you set the second.\n\n470\n00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.210\nIt will actually go ahead and do that.\n\n471\n00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.850\nSo you can use it any\nway that you want to but\n\n472\n00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:23.520\nthat's usually also the best recommended\npractice when using a resource pool.\n\n473\n00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.120\n>> Yeah, it's definitely a cool thing,\n\n474\n00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.960\nif you only do one project at\na time you don't need a pool.\n\n475\n00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.175\nIt's not, you're not going to have\nconflict, you can only do one at a time.\n\n476\n00:24:32.175 --> 00:24:37.375\nBut if you're managing several\nprojects running at the same time,\n\n477\n00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:39.835\nyou need some way to coordinate conflicts.\n\n478\n00:24:39.835 --> 00:24:41.355\nProject server is one route,\n\n479\n00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:43.852\nwhich is great if you have more\nthan one project Project manager.\n\n480\n00:24:43.852 --> 00:24:45.822\nResource pools are another route, and\n\n481\n00:24:45.822 --> 00:24:48.162\nthat's great if you're\nthe only project manager.\n\n482\n00:24:48.162 --> 00:24:50.882\nAnd the reason I keep saying if\nyou're the only project manager,\n\n483\n00:24:50.882 --> 00:24:53.052\nis because these are files for\nright here on the hard drive, and\n\n484\n00:24:53.052 --> 00:24:55.620\nthe links are made with direct\nhard links on the file.\n\n485\n00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.160\nYou could put them on a network share,\nand when they're on a network share,\n\n486\n00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.950\nif you've referenced the files,\nthe links and\n\n487\n00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.330\nstuff with the network share,\nother people could open it too.\n\n488\n00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:08.010\nBut these project files are data bases,\nand so when you open the master project,\n\n489\n00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.390\nyou're opening all the child projects too.\n\n490\n00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.750\nIf somebody tries to open up one of the\nchild projects, they're gonna get a read\n\n491\n00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.040\nonly copy because you're already in it and\nyou start to get conflicts.\n\n492\n00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.870\nProject Server solves that so\none product manager can use this,\n\n493\n00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.020\nmultiple project managers really\ndo need to go to Project Server.\n\n494\n00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.690\nSo that's definitely a big deal there.\n\n495\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.620\nSomething we definitely\nneed to be in mind about.\n\n496\n00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.500\nI'm looking something up real quick\ncuz I made a comment a second ago and\n\n497\n00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.970\nI'm starting to question myself.\n\n498\n00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:38.600\nI said that resource pools were in the pro\nversion and not the standard version.\n\n499\n00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.580\nAnd Microsoft changed that.\n\n500\n00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.520\nAnd so, I was just pulling it\nup here in the background.\n\n501\n00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.830\nBut it does say that the standard\nversion does support resource pools now.\n\n502\n00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.180\nAnd that's important because\nthe price difference is pretty big.\n\n503\n00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.220\nAnd if you pay full retail like we do,\nthe standard version's like $300,\n\n504\n00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.827\nthe pro version, is it $1200?\n\n505\n00:25:56.827 --> 00:25:57.955\n>> It's about $1100.\n\n506\n00:25:57.955 --> 00:25:58.520\n>> $1100.\n\n507\n00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.550\nSo it's a big difference so\n\n508\n00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.440\nsorry you don't have to have\nthe enterprise edition any more.\n\n509\n00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.150\nYou used to have,\nnot the enterprise, the pro version.\n\n510\n00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.430\nYou used to have the pro version.\n\n511\n00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.840\nNow you can just do it\nin the standard version.\n\n512\n00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.420\nIt's a cool functionality and\n\n513\n00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.580\nit's supported in every version\nof Microsoft Project App.\n\n514\n00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.870\n>> We can see now the flexibility\nof working with multiple projects\n\n515\n00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:21.390\njust using Project itself without having\nto have that additional project server.\n\n516\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.021\nIt handy to actually know\nthe techniques to do so.\n\n517\n00:26:23.021 --> 00:26:26.240\n>> All right well Ronnie I think that's\na pretty good run down right there of\n\n518\n00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.910\nmanaging multiple projects.\n\n519\n00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:29.860\nJust be aware, Project Server's out there.\n\n520\n00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.660\nIt's great, but\nit's not right for everybody.\n\n521\n00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.760\nResource pools are there.\n\n522\n00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.750\nIt's great, but again,\nnot right for everybody.\n\n523\n00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.790\nSo choose the solution that's right for\nyour environment.\n\n524\n00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.620\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n525\n00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.720\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n526\n00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.554\n>> I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n527\n00:26:42.554 --> 00:26:43.934\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n528\n00:26:43.934 --> 00:26:49.790\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.750\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.770\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.510\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.580\n>> It is going great.\n\n7\n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.460\nAnother exciting day,\n\n8\n00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.250\ncuz we get to actually spend\ntime in Microsoft Project 2013.\n\n9\n00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.035\nSo can't ask for a better day.\n\n10\n00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:30.420\n>> [LAUGH] Well, today we're going to be\ntackling an important part of Project,\n\n11\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.690\nwhich is when we start to add\nresources into our system,\n\n12\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.600\nthere's a lot of different\nvalues that we can set on\n\n13\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.400\nthat resource that indicate all\nsorts of crazy information.\n\n14\n00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.190\nAnd I know we've already talked about some\nof them in other episodes, but we want to\n\n15\n00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.170\nmake sure that we're thorough and\ncomplete so you're prepared for that exam.\n\n16\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.600\nSo, we're going to take a look at\neach one and kinda what they mean.\n\n17\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.270\nThe type of values that\nwe put in there and\n\n18\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.600\nhow they affect our project as a whole.\n\n19\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.160\nSo Ronnie, where should we start?\n\n20\n00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.790\n>> Let's go and start by taking\na look at a project plan itself.\n\n21\n00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.720\nRemember that up until this point if\nyou've been following along in this\n\n22\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.920\nseries, we've done create task.\n\n23\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.110\nWe've talked about scheduling.\n\n24\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.620\nWe've done all of that and\n\n25\n00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.380\nwe've even assigned a couple of resources,\nbut if you're like me,\n\n26\n00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.490\nyou're maybe like where in the world did\nyou pull these resources from Ronnie?\n\n27\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.210\nWhat, but where's this coming from?\n\n28\n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.660\nWell, inside of Microsoft Project you can\nactually insert in a resource sheet, and\n\n29\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.890\nthat's where you keep track of\nthe resources that you need.\n\n30\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.570\nNow, at the very heart of that resource\nsheet, it really is a listing of\n\n31\n00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.530\nthe names of people or\neven just a subject matter expert,\n\n32\n00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.560\nor a particular generic individual\nname that you might have.\n\n33\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.070\nYou might choose something like a software\ndeveloper or a project manager or\n\n34\n00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.090\nsomething like that.\n\n35\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.780\nAt the heart of it, that's all it\nreally is is listing those things.\n\n36\n00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.910\nBut it can also be what we call\nmaterial resources as well.\n\n37\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.560\nIn other words,\nthings that we will use during\n\n38\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.490\nthe project that are consumables too.\n\n39\n00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.200\nBut the way that we actually use that\nright here is that I have this project\n\n40\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.380\nplan, and so with this project plan,\nif I scroll over to the right-hand side.\n\n41\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.222\nNormally what we'll see are resources\nthat will appear over here, but\n\n42\n00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:02.511\nyou'll take a note, there are no resources\nthat appear, so what we have to do,\n\n43\n00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:05.411\nis we need to go ahead and\ncreate this resource sheet.\n\n44\n00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:08.873\nAnd the easiest way that to do\nthat is to go up to View, and\n\n45\n00:02:08.873 --> 00:02:12.880\nthen under Resource Views,\nI'm gonna select Resource Sheet.\n\n46\n00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.473\nSo think about this as your main\nspreadsheet of where your resources\n\n47\n00:02:16.473 --> 00:02:18.220\nare going to be housed.\n\n48\n00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.560\nAnd it not only gives\nus that list of names,\n\n49\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.916\nyou actually see that there's a lot of\ndifferent attributes that we can also add\n\n50\n00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:28.571\nin over here that will help us when\nwe start using those resources.\n\n51\n00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:33.280\nSuch as how much they're gonna get paid,\nhow often, and even a lot of times here\n\n52\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.100\ndifferences between things like\nstandard and over time rates.\n\n53\n00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.740\nSo what do we normally do\nto get a resource in here?\n\n54\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.660\nSo I'm just going to go ahead and do\nsomething generic here which is, I'm just\n\n55\n00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.870\ngoing to call it resource one because I'm\nnot real creative this morning to do that.\n\n56\n00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.350\nNow, the first thing is once\nI actually type that in and\n\n57\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.570\nI hit Tab, notice that it went ahead and\nstarted filling in some other things.\n\n58\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.830\nAnd so by default you're\nactually starting to see,\n\n59\n00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.280\nhey here's what Project is actually\nexpecting to see here right away.\n\n60\n00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.720\nWhen you take a look notice\nit says work type, right.\n\n61\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.510\nSo whenever you're just talking about\nthe idea of work type of resource,\n\n62\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.140\nwhat we're normally saying it's\ngonna be a person resource.\n\n63\n00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.350\nIn other words, they're gonna work hours,\nthey're gonna be paid,\n\n64\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.570\nthey're gonna actually do that and\nevery day that they're assigned,\n\n65\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.030\nwe're gonna have that work type\nof resource available there.\n\n66\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.230\nBut notice we have material\nresource that we can also use and\n\n67\n00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.870\nalso cost resource as well.\n\n68\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.070\nAnd you'll see the difference when you\ntake a look at the right hand side\n\n69\n00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.590\nthat when I change to material, notice\nthat a lot of the stuff disappeared and\n\n70\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.170\nthen when I changed to cost, even more\ninformation also disappeared as well.\n\n71\n00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.740\nSo remember that work resource\nusually is some type of\n\n72\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.840\nperson that we're going\nto have on our project.\n\n73\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.970\nMaterial resource is gonna be some\ntype of consumable that we're going\n\n74\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.690\nto use during our project.\n\n75\n00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.320\nAnd it's gonna end up getting used up.\n\n76\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.400\nSo if you're building a house it\nmight be lumber, it might be bricks.\n\n77\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.440\nIt might be whatever other\nmaterial that you have.\n\n78\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.134\nA cost resource though,\nmight be something that you actually do\n\n79\n00:04:02.134 --> 00:04:05.213\nuse as a one time basis, and\nyou pay for the usage of that.\n\n80\n00:04:05.213 --> 00:04:07.232\nOr it could be that if\nyou're actually dealing,\n\n81\n00:04:07.232 --> 00:04:10.288\nlet's say that you're dealing with\nsome type of software development or\n\n82\n00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:12.824\nsomething and you're flying\nin the subject matter expert.\n\n83\n00:04:12.824 --> 00:04:16.561\nAnd maybe, not that you're not gonna\npay the subject matter expert, but\n\n84\n00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:18.921\nwhat about their travel costs or\nhotel costs?\n\n85\n00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:21.030\nThings like that if\nthey're staying overnight.\n\n86\n00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.310\nAnd you don't have a way to\nspread that over the schedule,\n\n87\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.805\nbut you actually do want to make\nsure that you're using that\n\n88\n00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:28.865\nto show that you are expending money for\nthat as well.\n\n89\n00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:31.275\nSo, let's go ahead and\nstart off with the work resource.\n\n90\n00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:35.815\n>> Yeah, and another key thing to remember\nis that if your task is effort driven\n\n91\n00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:40.560\nwhen you choose a work type for\na resource, as you assign those resources,\n\n92\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.420\nit's gonna shorten the duration\nof an effort driven activity.\n\n93\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.910\nBut if you have material or cost chosen,\nwhether you're effort driven or not,\n\n94\n00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.160\nthose don't affect the duration, right?\n\n95\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.490\nSo adding a cost to something doesn't\nnecessarily make it get done faster, or\n\n96\n00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.430\nadding more lumber doesn't\nmake that house go up faster.\n\n97\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.900\nSo those are really used for\n\n98\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.190\ntracking resources in terms of materials,\nlike lumber, like you said.\n\n99\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.810\nAnd just your cash, your budgeting.\n\n100\n00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.360\nNow I know a lot of people don't\nbother using the cost piece because\n\n101\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.140\nMicrosoft Project's budgeting is\na little bit on the weak side.\n\n102\n00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.260\nSo if you're using external software for\n\n103\n00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.640\nmanaging your budgets,\nyou may never use costs here.\n\n104\n00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.430\nBut material, that one gets\nused pretty frequently because\n\n105\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.430\nyou might have something like\na projector or a dump truck\n\n106\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.370\nthat you can't have more than one task\nusing that dump truck at the same time.\n\n107\n00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.210\nSo we need to be able to\ntrack that resource, and\n\n108\n00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.490\nthat's a great way to use as a material.\n\n109\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.750\n>> So, if we go and\ntake a look at this work type of resource.\n\n110\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.190\nNotice that it has all these different\ncolumns and some of them are filled in.\n\n111\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.440\nAnd when it comes down to it a work type,\n\n112\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.800\nthe material resource itself is not\ngoing to actually calculate it.\n\n113\n00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.155\nUsually by default if it's\na work type material,\n\n114\n00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:44.300\nit's actually not going\nto take a look at it.\n\n115\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.840\nIn other words, if you are trying to\ndo something with it it's not going to.\n\n116\n00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.990\nBut a material column here, it says\na unit of measure that you might use for\n\n117\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.470\nexample, tons boxes or cubic yards.\n\n118\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.240\nWell, that would actually work\nif you're using material, and\n\n119\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.350\nyou can actually go ahead and do that.\n\n120\n00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.410\nBut when it's a work type,\nit's really a disabled field.\n\n121\n00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.370\nYou also have the ability to set\nan initial for this project, too.\n\n122\n00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.380\nNow, even though I set up\na generic resource name,\n\n123\n00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.440\nyou might have someone specific in mind\nthat you're choosing to set up here, and\n\n124\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.610\nyou just don't want to go out and\npencil it in and that way.\n\n125\n00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.740\nThis is what I'm expecting,\nbut you can go ahead and\n\n126\n00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.475\njust say,\nhere's the type of resource I need.\n\n127\n00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:23.325\nHere's who I believe is going\nto actually match up with.\n\n128\n00:06:23.325 --> 00:06:25.365\nOf course, you can do that too.\n\n129\n00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:27.785\n>> And the initials do get\nused in some of the reports.\n\n130\n00:06:27.785 --> 00:06:29.445\nFor the most part,\nyou won't see the initials again.\n\n131\n00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:32.045\nAnd you'll see which project\nhas taken the first letter\n\n132\n00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:34.757\nof whatever whatever name you gave it and\nusing that as the initials.\n\n133\n00:06:34.757 --> 00:06:37.997\nSo if it was a person,\nlike if it was me, you would put in DWP,\n\n134\n00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:41.007\nthose are my initials, and\non certain reports it may show that, but\n\n135\n00:06:41.007 --> 00:06:43.537\nmost of the time you'll\nsee that full name.\n\n136\n00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:46.328\n>> Now, here's an interesting\nfield as well that we call Group.\n\n137\n00:06:46.328 --> 00:06:49.262\nYou may find out that you're actually\nchoosing multiple resources, but\n\n138\n00:06:49.262 --> 00:06:51.498\nthey're actually all\npart of the same group.\n\n139\n00:06:51.498 --> 00:06:54.158\nYou can enter a group name for them.\n\n140\n00:06:54.158 --> 00:06:57.977\nIt doesn't show up any differently inside\nof Microsoft Project as a group of any\n\n141\n00:06:57.977 --> 00:07:01.910\nsort, but it gives you that ability to be\nable to do the filtering if you wanted to.\n\n142\n00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.555\nSay, here's all the people from\nthe software development team,\n\n143\n00:07:05.555 --> 00:07:09.200\nhere's all the people from\nthe hardware side of the development,\n\n144\n00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.935\nwhatever it might be, or\nthe construction team that we might have.\n\n145\n00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:15.660\nAnd that way you can actually go ahead and\nfilter by that, and\n\n146\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.114\neven run reports based off that as well.\n\n147\n00:07:18.114 --> 00:07:19.174\nNow in a work resource,\n\n148\n00:07:19.174 --> 00:07:22.930\nwe also want to set up what we\ncall this maximum number, too.\n\n149\n00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.870\nThe maximum percentage or capacity for\n\n150\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.470\nwhich a resource is available\nduring this current time period.\n\n151\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.560\nNow, when we set this up, remember\nthe default time that we were using is\n\n152\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.520\na standard eight-hour calendar, which we\nactually are working eight hours a day.\n\n153\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.811\nAnd so if I'm saying that Resource1\nis gonna be available for\n\n154\n00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:46.861\nall eight hours of that day I can\nset it to, well, a maximum of 100%.\n\n155\n00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:51.811\nIf I can say that they were actually gonna\nbe available let's say 200% I'd be putting\n\n156\n00:07:51.811 --> 00:07:53.667\nthem on for 16 hours of the day.\n\n157\n00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:57.995\nBut normally we might actually use this if\nwe're actually going to also take a look\n\n158\n00:07:57.995 --> 00:08:00.520\nat using part-time resources as well,\nokay?\n\n159\n00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.559\nSo, we can actually set that up and that\nway When we assign them to a resource,\n\n160\n00:08:04.559 --> 00:08:07.001\nit's not going to over\nallocate them per day.\n\n161\n00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:09.295\nThey're actually going to be\navailable just that way and\n\n162\n00:08:09.295 --> 00:08:11.750\nthen you actually do over\nallocations on your own.\n\n163\n00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.750\n>> I've used this one\na few different ways.\n\n164\n00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.970\nIf it's somebody who is part time,\nlike you said, Ronnie,\n\n165\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.500\nthat's a great way to use it.\n\n166\n00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.480\nI mean you can also do\nthat with a calendar to.\n\n167\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.350\nYou can adjust their working\nschedule based on the calendar and\n\n168\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.460\nthat would knock it out.\n\n169\n00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.000\nIf you have somebody who's split between\ntwo projects, you don't wanna changed\n\n170\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.600\ntheir working calendar cuz they\nare working eight hours that day.\n\n171\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.730\nBut maybe they only worked for\nour project 50% of the day and\n\n172\n00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.030\nthe other project 50% of the day.\n\n173\n00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.820\nOr maybe you have a salaried employee and\nas a salaried employee,\n\n174\n00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.830\ninstead of 40 hours a week they\nare expected to work 50 hours a week.\n\n175\n00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.880\nAnd so I might set their utilization or\ntheir max units\n\n176\n00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.650\nat 120% because I know they can do 20%\nmore work as salary versus hourly.\n\n177\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.020\nSo there's various reasons why we\nmight want to manipulate that,\n\n178\n00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.480\nto change how they can work but\nnot manipulate their actual calendar.\n\n179\n00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.450\n>> And then we have these next two\ncolumns and this is where it really\n\n180\n00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:04.380\nbecomes important when you start tracking\nof course the expense on your project,\n\n181\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.970\nis the standard rate and\nthe overtime rate as well.\n\n182\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.110\nSo if you had a resource and\n\n183\n00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.530\nhe was working on my project\nin the Terminal server,\n\n184\n00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:16.020\nlet's say that he was actually going\nto work at, let's say at $12 per hour.\n\n185\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.370\nI can do a 12 and then a /h,\n\n186\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:23.430\nand when I do that notice it actually\nfills in that hour rate if we need it to.\n\n187\n00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.040\nBut what Don was talking about is\nalso very interesting as well.\n\n188\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.590\nHow do we actually show\nthings like a salary too.\n\n189\n00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:35.010\nSo if I wanted to show a salary I\nmight actually say something like,\n\n190\n00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.220\nlet's say that he makes $50,000 a year.\n\n191\n00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.800\nWell, the easiest way to do that is\ntype in 50,000 in a standard and\n\n192\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.750\nthen do a slash, and then a y,\nand then when I hit tab.\n\n193\n00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.550\nLet me see if I can stretch that\nout a little bit so we can see it.\n\n194\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.980\nNotice it can account for that.\n\n195\n00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.540\nSo you do have several options there\nthat you can actually enter in,\n\n196\n00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.685\nif you were doing something like that.\n\n197\n00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:59.965\nAnd that way, you don't know what the cost\nis, but you're just going to make\n\n198\n00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:02.645\nan estimate about what you\nbelieve they're going to cost.\n\n199\n00:10:02.645 --> 00:10:05.045\nYou may actually choose to do\nsomething like that as well.\n\n200\n00:10:05.045 --> 00:10:11.095\nSo I'm gonna go back to $12 an hour to\nkind of help me out here a little bit.\n\n201\n00:10:11.095 --> 00:10:14.350\nThe other one, of course,\nthen, is the over time.\n\n202\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.210\nRemember that if you are going\nto be overallocating them,\n\n203\n00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.140\nthat means you're gonna have to pay them\nmore money, and so when you take a look at\n\n204\n00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.790\nthe overtime rate, 100% max for\nthis resource is 8 hours a day.\n\n205\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.733\nOnce they actually go over that 8 hours,\nmore than likely you're gonna have\n\n206\n00:10:31.733 --> 00:10:36.159\nto recalculate their time on that\nproject for a bit more in overtime.\n\n207\n00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:40.264\nAnd overtime would be 18, time and a half?\n\n208\n00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:41.880\n>> Now you want me to do math, Ronnie?\n\n209\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.650\n>> Yeah, now I want you to do math,\nabsolutely.\n\n210\n00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.160\n>> It is time and a half in a lot\nof places, but not necessarily, so\n\n211\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.400\nyou can manually put in what that rate is.\n\n212\n00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.390\nOr you may just put in the same rate and\n\n213\n00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.860\nthen you're basically just using it for\ntracking at that point.\n\n214\n00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.940\nYou're not actually paying different.\n\n215\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.650\nBut you wanna make sure it's accurate,\nbecause it is gonna affect your budget.\n\n216\n00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:04.080\n>> Then you also have of course cost per\nuse if you also had to re-sort by that.\n\n217\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.730\nNormally on a regular work resource\nit's probably not gonna do you\n\n218\n00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.020\nvery much good there.\n\n219\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.480\nBut this is the interesting one\nright here, the accrue app rate,\n\n220\n00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.310\nDon is what we have accrue at,\nwhich is prorated by default but\n\n221\n00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.940\nwe can have it start and have it end.\n\n222\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.730\nSo when you start doing\nsomething like this,\n\n223\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.030\nespecially on something like that you\nactually hire a team to come in and\n\n224\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.360\ndo something like that,\nit might be that you go, look,\n\n225\n00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.140\nthey're telling us it's gonna cost this\nmuch and we need to pay that up front.\n\n226\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.310\nWell, we might actually go ahead and\nchoose well start, or if we actually say,\n\n227\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.680\nlook they're saying that they'll\nfinish the whole thing and\n\n228\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.160\nwe just have to pay them at the end,\nyou can do that.\n\n229\n00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.750\nOr usually Don,\nthe default is this prorate.\n\n230\n00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.080\nWhat's that about?\n\n231\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.060\n>> That just means that we're going\nto pay them for the time that we use.\n\n232\n00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.290\nSo if they start halfway through\nthe month, we're not going to pay them for\n\n233\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.090\nthe whole month and\nthen we'll pay generally as we go.\n\n234\n00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.610\nIt's a crude payment.\n\n235\n00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.170\nThat's what normally happens is you pay\npeople every other week or whatever.\n\n236\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.630\nThis doesn't change our budget too much.\n\n237\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.290\nWe'll see in the cost episodes where\nit does sort of lay out a little bit\n\n238\n00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.770\ndifferently in our cost schedule.\n\n239\n00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.005\nBut for the most part it's\njust fort he accounting side.\n\n240\n00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:13.180\nAnd odds are your payroll team is\nbasically running their own software\n\n241\n00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.010\nanyway, so this is just a marker to\nhelp you for your reports to show when\n\n242\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.620\nyou're going to need a certain\namount of money to make payroll.\n\n243\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.060\n>> And\nthen you can also assign a base calendar,\n\n244\n00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.220\nif your project plan is already\nassigned a calendar, I went ahead and\n\n245\n00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.860\nalso put this resource on\nthat base calendar as well.\n\n246\n00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.200\nAnd that way it will follow that\nas far as the time off, and\n\n247\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.090\nthe different holiday schedules too.\n\n248\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.640\nBut remember that doesn't mean\nthat you can't change it.\n\n249\n00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.634\nIf this particular resource is not\nactually gonna be available for that,\n\n250\n00:12:42.634 --> 00:12:47.158\nyou can actually create a resource\ncalendar and tie it right here.\n\n251\n00:12:47.158 --> 00:12:49.640\nThat way when you do assign\nthis resource to a task,\n\n252\n00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.559\nit will follow that calendar instead.\n\n253\n00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:55.505\nWe do have another episode in which we\nwent over the creation of those resource\n\n254\n00:12:55.505 --> 00:12:58.060\ncalendars, so take a look at that as well.\n\n255\n00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.700\nThis last one is also code.\n\n256\n00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.850\nLet's say that you're not following any\none number that the track this resource\n\n257\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.590\nlike this ID number over here that's\ngoing to be a generic ID number, but\n\n258\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.930\nyou had an internal code that you wanted\nto follow you can also set that up and\n\n259\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.830\neven create your own custom fields.\n\n260\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.660\n>> Yeah, accounting codes\nlike these are very common.\n\n261\n00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.340\nSo if you had a project and\n\n262\n00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.950\nyou're using internal employees,\nare those employee's free?\n\n263\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.010\nDo we get them for free?\n\n264\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.310\nNo, there's a cost there.\n\n265\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.640\nIt's just you're not paying\nsome external company for it,\n\n266\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.080\nlike when you contract out.\n\n267\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.470\nSo you may have an accounting code, so\nthat that employee might be working for\n\n268\n00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.140\nthe IT department, but\nthey're working on your project.\n\n269\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.940\nAnd so your project is responsible for\nthat employee's salary for that time.\n\n270\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.250\nAnd so you might have an accounting\ncode to reference that or\n\n271\n00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.970\nsome code for that external contractor.\n\n272\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.760\nYou can really put whatever\nthe heck you want in there, but\n\n273\n00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.810\nit is designed for accounting codes.\n\n274\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.360\n>> Now that we've actually set\nup just a regular work resource,\n\n275\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.470\nwe want to take a look at just if\nthere's any differences really if I\n\n276\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.700\nuse them like the material\nresource as well.\n\n277\n00:13:54.700 --> 00:14:01.684\nSo let's say that what I know is I'm gonna\nneed some CAT5 cabling, Here and when\n\n278\n00:14:01.684 --> 00:14:07.130\nI'm working with that, I'm gonna actually\nmake it a material resource instead.\n\n279\n00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.590\nAnd when I do that, notice the defaults\nthat have actually changed.\n\n280\n00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.960\nNot much, but a little bit of this\nstuff has actually changed here.\n\n281\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.800\nAnd then I can actually say how much\nI'm actually going to be using of this.\n\n282\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.610\nAnd here they talk about the measurement\nthat we'll actually be using.\n\n283\n00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.220\nLet me see if I can hover over that again.\n\n284\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.550\nThe unit of measurement you enter for\n\n285\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.270\nthis material resource is boxes,\ntons, however much it might be.\n\n286\n00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.700\nSo let's say that I buy two\nboxes of 1,000 feet of cable.\n\n287\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.480\nYou know, you might actually\nset something like that up.\n\n288\n00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.570\nSo that we can actually account for\nthat if we needed to.\n\n289\n00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.880\n>> Or if you're buying it by the foot or\nby the meter,\n\n290\n00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.610\nyou are going to put in that\nunit of measure, whatever it is.\n\n291\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.920\nAnd when we buy CAT5,\nwe might set it by a standard box size.\n\n292\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.940\nBut what if I buy a 500 foot box today and\na 1,000 foot box next month?\n\n293\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.860\nThat's gonna be different.\n\n294\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.300\nSo you could add those in\njust two different materials.\n\n295\n00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.700\nOr you could do it as one material\nif it was a fixed cost, but\n\n296\n00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.053\nunfortunately that doesn't always happen.\n\n297\n00:14:57.053 --> 00:14:59.900\nSo if I buy that 1,000 foot box,\n\n298\n00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.990\nI get a bigger discount than\nif I buy the 500 foot box.\n\n299\n00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.880\nSo you might not be able to\ndo it by a unit of measure.\n\n300\n00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.230\nYou might have to do it by\nboxes like Ronnie was saying.\n\n301\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.910\nOr you might have to be really specific\nand say, this is a 500 foot box and\n\n302\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:12.850\ndo another line item for\n\n303\n00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:18.250\n1000 foot box because it will have\na different price associated with them.\n\n304\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.690\n>> Now, we have a choice.\n\n305\n00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.320\nThese other initials, even though\nthey actually show us a cable and\n\n306\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.310\nwe can use that, but notice that group and\n\n307\n00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:29.170\nmax, these aren't actually not filled in\nbecause there's no, and I can't even click\n\n308\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:33.320\non the scroll wheel here to try and\nactually increase the maximum size.\n\n309\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.560\nThey're saying, hey, here's a resource\nthat's gonna end up being used up so\n\n310\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.830\nyou're probably gonna use all of it or\nnone of it.\n\n311\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:39.690\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n312\n00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.050\nAnd you have Standard Rate and\nthen of course Cost Per Use.\n\n313\n00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.020\nNow you may choose here, if I'd chose like\na box, I think I looked it up the other\n\n314\n00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.930\nday for 1,000 feet and\nit was like $102 or maybe like $80.\n\n315\n00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.430\nI can't remember.\n\n316\n00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.625\nThere were a couple of different\nones that I looked up.\n\n317\n00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:56.519\nSo I can actually enter that in in\nstandard rate, on the overtime,\n\n318\n00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:58.537\nnotice I went ahead and\nshifted it over there,\n\n319\n00:15:58.537 --> 00:16:02.080\nit doesn't give me the actual ability to\ngo ahead and type anything I'm trying.\n\n320\n00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.080\nAnd that won't actually let\nme type in anything there.\n\n321\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.488\nBut then if I were running it,\nI could also set up this work resource for\n\n322\n00:16:09.488 --> 00:16:14.268\na cost per use as well, and then say how\nmuch I'm actually using of it too, so\n\n323\n00:16:14.268 --> 00:16:16.710\nyou're sending up the same thing.\n\n324\n00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.900\n>> Yeah, you've got to think about\nthe difference here in materials,\n\n325\n00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.540\nespecially with things that you rent.\n\n326\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.730\nSo if I'm buying lumber\nfrom the lumber store,\n\n327\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.411\nfrom whatever store it is\nthat you buy lumber from.\n\n328\n00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:29.454\n[LAUGH] I'm ruining this example.\n\n329\n00:16:29.454 --> 00:16:31.950\nSo if you buy lumber,\nyou get 100% of that lumber.\n\n330\n00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.260\nIt's not like your getting\njust a part of the lumber,\n\n331\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.460\nit's not like it's just\navailable just some of the time.\n\n332\n00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.110\nYou bought it, you got it,\nit's available 100%.\n\n333\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.390\nSo that's why we can't\nmodify that max unit.\n\n334\n00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.360\nYou've bought it, you've got it.\n\n335\n00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.550\nNow when you put that in, that's it.\n\n336\n00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.690\nYou already paid for it,\nyou bought it, it's a tangible item.\n\n337\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.690\nBut if it's a truck that you rent,\nright, well if you're renting it,\n\n338\n00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.630\nyou don't get it a hundred\npercent of the time.\n\n339\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.330\nYou only have it when you're using it.\n\n340\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.170\nAnd every time you use it,\nthere's a cost associated.\n\n341\n00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.360\nSo there's a cost per use.\n\n342\n00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.400\nIf I buy that lumber,\nthere's a one time cost.\n\n343\n00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.310\nI pay for it and I've got it.\n\n344\n00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.350\nAnd if I need to buy more lumber,\nthat's a different story.\n\n345\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.860\nI go and buy more lumber, but\nwith that truck, every time I use it,\n\n346\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.880\nthere is a cost per use.\n\n347\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.590\nSo we have that separate\ncolumn to be able to track it.\n\n348\n00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:18.040\nIt just comes down to the different types\nof resources that you're working with.\n\n349\n00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.660\n>> And then if I were purchasing this, I\nmight actually say, hey, I went ahead and\n\n350\n00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:26.340\nspent the whole $102 and I don't get to\ntie a project calendar to it as well.\n\n351\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.220\nSo you'll see that there's some of these\nthat are just not gonna be available\n\n352\n00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.520\nto you if you choose something\nlike this type of resource here.\n\n353\n00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.760\nAnd that's where you would go in.\n\n354\n00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.880\nIf you have all of the data available\nto you to enter in, as much as you can,\n\n355\n00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.390\nthat's what you wanna do here.\n\n356\n00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.810\nYou wanna make this as complete as\nyou can, and as accurate as you can\n\n357\n00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:46.230\nbecause here's the data that's going\nto be used as a basis for some of\n\n358\n00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.750\nthe reports that you're gonna run later\nand also for calculating out all the other\n\n359\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:54.630\ninformation on your project plan when you\nstart assigning them to resources as well.\n\n360\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.400\nNow this is not the only place that\nwe need to take a look at though when\n\n361\n00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.108\nwe start taking a look\nat resources themselves.\n\n362\n00:18:01.108 --> 00:18:05.430\nIf I right-click let's say on resource\none here and I right-click and\n\n363\n00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.470\nI go down to Information and\n\n364\n00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.560\nhopefully right here this is what we\nalso want to be able take a look at too.\n\n365\n00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.970\nSo it may be for this resource, itself,\n\n366\n00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.010\nwe may find out that he can't\nwork the standard eight or\n\n367\n00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.700\nthe standard calendar that we normally\nwould work on that base calendar.\n\n368\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.190\nWell notice I can come in here and\nchange his working time if I needed to.\n\n369\n00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.120\nWhen I do that I'm really\nchanging his work calendar.\n\n370\n00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:37.040\nSo you might actually go in there and add\nin a different schedule at that point for\n\n371\n00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.430\nthat resource to be able to come in.\n\n372\n00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:44.480\nOr like you have over here in the lower\nleft-hand corner of this generic, or\n\n373\n00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.000\nthe general tab where it\nsays Resource Availability.\n\n374\n00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.460\nWhat if you find out that that resource is\nnot gonna be available for the first two\n\n375\n00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.020\nweeks, because he's either on vacation or\nhe's actually assigned to another project.\n\n376\n00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.140\nWell, you can also set that up here and\nsay, look,\n\n377\n00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.145\nhe's only going to be available from\nthis particular time to this time, but\n\n378\n00:19:03.145 --> 00:19:05.275\nafter that, he's supposed to\nbe on a different project.\n\n379\n00:19:05.275 --> 00:19:08.185\nWe may go ahead and\nset that up right here as well.\n\n380\n00:19:08.185 --> 00:19:10.295\n>> Yeah, the cool part is\nyou can set the units too.\n\n381\n00:19:10.295 --> 00:19:11.985\nSo maybe it's not that\nhe's completely out,\n\n382\n00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.535\nmaybe he just has reduced\navailability those days.\n\n383\n00:19:14.535 --> 00:19:18.625\nSo he's going to be split between other\nprojects, so we said it's 50% for\n\n384\n00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.555\nthat period of time, but\nit's good flexibility.\n\n385\n00:19:20.555 --> 00:19:21.385\n>> It really is.\n\n386\n00:19:21.385 --> 00:19:24.785\nAnd there's only one other thing that\nyou can actually start seeing some\n\n387\n00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:25.570\nother things.\n\n388\n00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.100\nAnd notice if you type in all\nthese other things, like group and\n\n389\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.990\ncode, that stuff should also fill in\nhere in the resource information.\n\n390\n00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:34.790\nBut right here where it\nsays booking type too.\n\n391\n00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:39.560\nIf I select that booking type, I can\nselect it as a proposed booking type or\n\n392\n00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.620\na committed one.\n\n393\n00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.470\nNow that doesn't really\naffect the schedule.\n\n394\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.030\nWhat it allows you to do is\nto actually know whether or\n\n395\n00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:50.070\nnot this is a tentative commitment,\nthat this person can make it or\n\n396\n00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:54.910\nwhether you absolutely 100% believe\nthat they're also gonna make it too.\n\n397\n00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.480\nSo you have this booking type that you\ncan go ahead and set that up on and\n\n398\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.960\nthat way you know whether or not you're\nactually going to be able to use them or\n\n399\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.250\nyour likelihood of using\nthem is also greater.\n\n400\n00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.600\nAnd again, this comes down to\nthe reports that you're gonna run.\n\n401\n00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.010\nIf you need to take a look at\nall of your committed bookings,\n\n402\n00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.160\nin other words,\nall the people that you're gonna have.\n\n403\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.260\nAnd you wanna go all right,\nwho's actually committed to this,\n\n404\n00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.490\nversus who's proposed,\nit helps you out here.\n\n405\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.060\nSo the more details that you can fill out\nhere, the better it's also going to be.\n\n406\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.260\n>> Yeah, like a lot of things in project,\nthere's just more than one way you can do\n\n407\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.785\nthings, more than one place you can put\nthings, so this is kind of a quick way.\n\n408\n00:20:30.785 --> 00:20:32.930\nApeaking of more than\none place to do things,\n\n409\n00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.150\nyou came here to the resource\nsheet to create these resources.\n\n410\n00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:39.140\nIf you're just in the planning phases,\nyou can really quickly and\n\n411\n00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.240\neasily create resources\nright from the Gantt chart.\n\n412\n00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.270\nIf you just type in a new resource name\nand press enter, it will create one.\n\n413\n00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.060\nBut it will create it as a work type.\n\n414\n00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.900\nAssuming that it's a person and\nnot material or cost.\n\n415\n00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.060\nIf you enter them in that way you've\ngot to come back here to go and\n\n416\n00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.820\nupdate those and change them too.\n\n417\n00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.960\nWhile there is more than one way to do it,\nhere in the resource sheet kind of gives\n\n418\n00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.350\nyou that all in one spot where\nyou can make sure it's right.\n\n419\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.910\n>> Yeah, let's kind of show what happen\nonce we have this resource sheet\n\n420\n00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.130\ncreated as well.\n\n421\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.600\nI went ahead and switched backed\nover to the Gantt Chart view.\n\n422\n00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.430\nI selected Task, then I selected Gantt\nChart and that brings me back over here.\n\n423\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.150\nThen to the right hand side\nthere's resource names.\n\n424\n00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:20.170\nIf I created that resource sheet,\nI just need to click on the drop down and\n\n425\n00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.290\nthis way I can actually choose\nwhat resource I'm going to assign.\n\n426\n00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.150\nSo all your available\nresources are right there for\n\n427\n00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.110\nyou if you needed to actually\nassign a multiple resources to.\n\n428\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.430\nSo you can actually do that as well for\neach one of these if you choose to.\n\n429\n00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.790\nSo, I want to assign two resources,\nnotice I can also do that.\n\n430\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.580\nSo it doesn't always have to\nbe one resource per task.\n\n431\n00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.130\nYou can go through and actually add in\nas many resources that you want to.\n\n432\n00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:47.800\nThe way that Don was talking about, if I\nwanted to add in, let's say, resource two.\n\n433\n00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.600\nNotice it takes it perfectly.\n\n434\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.190\nThere it is and actually adds it in.\n\n435\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.750\nAnd now notice it actually\nmade another connection there.\n\n436\n00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:59.330\nAnd so we go back to what Don was talking\nabout, view and then resource sheets.\n\n437\n00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.710\nNotice that resource number two\nwas also added in there too.\n\n438\n00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.780\nYou don't always have to do it from here,\nbut this is where you want to set up as\n\n439\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:12.100\nmany of those standard attributes\nthat you have available to you\n\n440\n00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.900\nto be able to create what you need to and\nnotice that there's no standard rates.\n\n441\n00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.490\nSo you still have to come\nback here anyways to add in\n\n442\n00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.710\nall the rest of these\ndetailed information.\n\n443\n00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.735\nProbably better if you can\nactually do it all from here but\n\n444\n00:22:21.735 --> 00:22:26.580\nif not, you at least can create them\nin that task, in the Gantt chart, and\n\n445\n00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.260\nonce you do that you can come back over\nhere and fill in the rest of the details.\n\n446\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.430\n>> You know something just\npopped into my mind Ronnie.\n\n447\n00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:35.000\nIf you watched our previous episode where\nwe were talking about managing multiple\n\n448\n00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.140\nprojects, we talked about\ncreating a resource pool,\n\n449\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.090\nwhere our resources weren't\nactually in the project itself, but\n\n450\n00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.120\nwe're in a separate resource pool so\nit can be shared amongst projects.\n\n451\n00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.090\nSo if your about to do\na bunch of data entry for\n\n452\n00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.960\nnew resources, it's probably a good\nidea to put them in the pool,\n\n453\n00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.130\nthat way they can be shared\nacross the projects.\n\n454\n00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.950\nYou don't have to.\n\n455\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.760\nYou could have resources that were\njust in the individual projects, but\n\n456\n00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.970\nif you've got a pool,\nit's a good idea to put them there.\n\n457\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.090\nThe data entry's done the same exact way.\n\n458\n00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.110\nIt's the same fields.\n\n459\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.400\nYou just punch them in and\nnow they can be shared.\n\n460\n00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.790\nReally handy with employees, not so handy\nwith things like lumber or cat five cable.\n\n461\n00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:12.692\nBut with employees and equipment that's\nreally nice because you can see when you\n\n462\n00:23:12.692 --> 00:23:16.590\nover allocate and\nthat's a pretty important feature.\n\n463\n00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:17.180\nAll right Ronnie,\n\n464\n00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.830\nwell I think we've pretty exhaustively\ncovered creating a new resource.\n\n465\n00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.575\nAre there any other things\nwe need to touch on?\n\n466\n00:23:21.575 --> 00:23:22.235\nNot right now.\n\n467\n00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:26.255\nNow what we have to do in the future is\nthat now that we've got these resource\n\n468\n00:23:26.255 --> 00:23:30.575\npools, we next talk about how we attach to\nthem to the tasks and see what happens.\n\n469\n00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:33.505\n>> And see how angry our employees\nget after they see how much\n\n470\n00:23:33.505 --> 00:23:34.970\nwork they have to do.\n\n471\n00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.720\nAll right, well we're gonna\nwrap this one up right here.\n\n472\n00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.350\nStay tuned, we've got more resource\nactivity coming down the line from\n\n473\n00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:44.660\nMicrosoft project, but signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n474\n00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.390\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n475\n00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.476\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n476\n00:23:46.476 --> 00:23:51.970\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.500\n>> It is going well today.\n\n6\n00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.930\nAnother exciting day, because we get to\nactually spend time in Microsoft Project.\n\n7\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.470\n>> Yeah.\n\n8\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.540\nToday we're going to be diving\ninto managing our resources.\n\n9\n00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.110\nNow we've kind of already filmed\nan episode on resources, as far as\n\n10\n00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.420\ncreating them, getting them put into the\nresource sheet, getting them available.\n\n11\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.151\nBut we never actually\ngave them any work to do.\n\n12\n00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:37.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the whole point of putting them in\n\n13\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.010\nhere is to give them work.\n\n14\n00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.180\nSo in this episode we're gonna look at\nassigning work for our resources to do so\n\n15\n00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.310\nwe can justify paying them at\nthe end of the payroll period.\n\n16\n00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.695\nAnd not have to lay-off all our employees.\n\n17\n00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:47.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.880\nRemember that everything we've done up to\nthis point really seems like we've only\n\n19\n00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.180\nseen a little bit of\nthe power behind Project.\n\n20\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.510\nBesides that, it's really been the data\nentry form for us and so it's right here.\n\n21\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.890\nOnce we actually start linking\nthose things together,\n\n22\n00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.880\nwe're going to see actually how project\nreally is an incredibly powerful tool\n\n23\n00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.840\nto allow us to see every\nfacet of our project.\n\n24\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.390\nIt's going to be neat as\nwe take a look at this\n\n25\n00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.980\nlittle series on resource assignments.\n\n26\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.840\n>> All right, so\nlet's say you've sat down and\n\n27\n00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.870\nyou've punched in all of your resources.\n\n28\n00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.090\nOr maybe you haven't thought of some yet\nand\n\n29\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.030\nyou're gonna create them\nkind of on the fly.\n\n30\n00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.380\nWell, once we've got our resources made,\nwe're ready to assign them some work.\n\n31\n00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.750\nAnd there's a few different ways to\ngo about it based on what level or\n\n32\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.990\nwhat point you're at in the project and\nwhat level of comfort you have.\n\n33\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.230\nIf you're in the very early\nplanning basis of a project,\n\n34\n00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.310\nlet me show you an example here.\n\n35\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.670\nI'm a going to just whip\na new project on my machines.\n\n36\n00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.920\nHere I got a blank project.\n\n37\n00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.390\nAnd we're just in the planning phases and\n\n38\n00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.980\nI say something like, all right Ronnie,\nwhat's involved in building a house.\n\n39\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.950\nWe're going to build a house.\n\n40\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.970\nSo we got to buy some land.\n\n41\n00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.400\nWe got to pull permits.\n\n42\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.600\nYou just start thinking of\nthe things you have to do.\n\n43\n00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.570\nYou have to level the ground or break\nground, or what ever we want to call it.\n\n44\n00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.520\nLay a foundation and so on.\n\n45\n00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.350\nSo you're just starting to come over\nthe things that have to be done to get\n\n46\n00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.000\nthat house built.\n\n47\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.180\nAnd then you start thinking about the kind\nof people you're going to need for it.\n\n48\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.445\nWell, if you've already created this\nresource sheet with all of your stuff in\n\n49\n00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:12.635\nthere, that's great.\n\n50\n00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:16.025\nBut if you're just trying to think of it\nhere from a ballpark, you can actually\n\n51\n00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:19.795\nkinda stretch this Gantt chart over so\nthat we can see the resource names, and\n\n52\n00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.447\nyou can just start typing\nin placeholder names.\n\n53\n00:02:23.447 --> 00:02:26.867\nAnd if it's something that a single\nperson could do, so, buy land.\n\n54\n00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:28.847\nWell, somebody's gotta buy that land.\n\n55\n00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:29.627\nWho's it gonna be?\n\n56\n00:02:29.627 --> 00:02:34.897\nWell, maybe that's the investor, or\nwhoever the homeowner is gonna be.\n\n57\n00:02:34.897 --> 00:02:36.017\nLet's say it's me.\n\n58\n00:02:36.017 --> 00:02:39.917\nSo if I know who it is specifically,\nI can just put in my name.\n\n59\n00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:45.500\nOr if I think it's gonna be somebody\ngeneric, I could just say Homeowner.\n\n60\n00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.650\nIs that one word or two words?\n\n61\n00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.630\n>> I think it's one word.\n\n62\n00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.390\n>> All right, well we'll find out.\n\n63\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.120\nThere you go.\n\n64\n00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.370\nSo you just type it in.\n\n65\n00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.040\nNow when I did that,\nI created a resource called homeowner and\n\n66\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.360\nassigned it to the buy land activity.\n\n67\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.730\nSo I did two things at once\nautomatically in the background.\n\n68\n00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.499\nIf I jump over to my resource sheet.\n\n69\n00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.090\nI can see I've got a resource\nnamed homeowner now.\n\n70\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.270\nIt made it for\nme with all the default values.\n\n71\n00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.470\nThat may be a problem now\nbecause it's not accurate, but\n\n72\n00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.930\nin the planning phase I\"m okay with that.\n\n73\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.330\nWhen I go back to my Gantt chart, I can\nsee the Homeowner is assigned to it and\n\n74\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.290\nif I find it in my chart, it's going to\nhave to have some kind of duration here,\n\n75\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.845\nlet's say it's going to take me 30 days.\n\n76\n00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:28.610\nI\"ll put that in as an estimate.\n\n77\n00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.010\nThere we go.\nAnd when we look inside of our Ganttchart,\n\n78\n00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.420\nI can see that laid out.\n\n79\n00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.920\nAnd I can see right there\nthe resource assigned to it.\n\n80\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.300\nNow if it's something that's gonna\ninvolve more than one person,\n\n81\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.310\nwe just separate them by commas.\n\n82\n00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.480\nSo I might have something like\npull permits and I put for\n\n83\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.490\nthat my general contractor.\n\n84\n00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.270\nThey're the ones that are gonna do that.\n\n85\n00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.700\nBut then all the way down here at the end,\nI might have some kind of activity that\n\n86\n00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.770\nsays, sign off on completion.\n\n87\n00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.070\nAnd that might actually be a team\nthing between the general contractor,\n\n88\n00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.840\nwhich you can see it's auto completing for\nme right there.\n\n89\n00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.090\nAnd if I keep typing,\nI can just add a comma after, whoops.\n\n90\n00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.940\nI can try and add a comma after\nthe general contractor's name and\n\n91\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.930\nthen I can come in and\ntype in homeowner and\n\n92\n00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.560\nI can have more than one resource\nthere separated by commas.\n\n93\n00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.520\nNow I know that the general contractor and\n\n94\n00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.470\nthe homeowner have to work together\non signing off for completion.\n\n95\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.850\nAnd if we just assign that $1,\napparently a one day.\n\n96\n00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.770\nThere.\nAnd we find it in our Gantt chart.\n\n97\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.960\nWe should see where.\n\n98\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.040\nThere.\nSo now it's got those\n\n99\n00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.570\ntwo resources assigned to it.\n\n100\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.320\nI can see what's going on.\n\n101\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.670\nSo pretty easy to assign\na resource to an activity.\n\n102\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.210\nIn fact, once the resources are already\nthere I don't even have to type them.\n\n103\n00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.290\nI can take something like level the ground\nand you'll see that's a drop down box and\n\n104\n00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.770\nit will list all of the resources in my\nproject and I can just check them off.\n\n105\n00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.270\nSo if I have a project that is\na little more fully developed,\n\n106\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.960\nlike this project that I've\ngot tucked away back here.\n\n107\n00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.830\nThis one has a full resource sheet.\n\n108\n00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.000\nAnd so if I take something and\n\n109\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.200\nlet me just kind of blank out\nthe resources on this one.\n\n110\n00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.750\nSo now I've got this job submit shop\ndrawings, and nobody's attached to it,\n\n111\n00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.220\nI can hit the drop-down for this one and\nI'm going to see all the resources for\n\n112\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.390\nthat project, and\nI can come in and choose them.\n\n113\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.280\nThis is going to be people,\nas well as material and costs.\n\n114\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.610\nI just go down the line and check off\nwho all's going to be involved in this.\n\n115\n00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.500\nAnd I wasn't paying attention\nto what job that was,\n\n116\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.560\nbut let's just say it's\nsomething electric, and so\n\n117\n00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.520\nI might assign my electrical contractor\nunder electrical contractor management.\n\n118\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.590\nAnd I punch them in, and\nnow, they're assigned.\n\n119\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.570\nSo it's really easy to\ngive somebody work to do\n\n120\n00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.650\nright here through the Gantt chart and\ntask list.\n\n121\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.960\nThe only problem is,\n\n122\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.480\nI can't really tell if I'm assigning\nsomebody work that's overlapping.\n\n123\n00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.830\nSo for example,\nI assign the electrical contractor and\n\n124\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.150\nelectrical manager right here to this\nactivity that's Monday, August 10th.\n\n125\n00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.690\nWell, I've got another activity\nright after that that's Monday,\n\n126\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.250\nAugust 10th also.\n\n127\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.670\nWhat happens if I go in and\nassign the same people?\n\n128\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.060\nAnd I could pick them in\nthe drop-down boxes again, or\n\n129\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.450\nI could actually just drag this box and\ndo it like that to copy them,\n\n130\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.770\nbut when I do it, see how I just\nover allocated those people?\n\n131\n00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.860\nSo I get my little warning bell over here\nletting me know I got an over allocation.\n\n132\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.800\nAssigning it this way is really easy, but\n\n133\n00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.180\nit doesn't give us a lot of\nadvance functionality, like,\n\n134\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.200\nseeing we're about to over allocate people\nuntil after the fact, until it's too late.\n\n135\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.540\nSo that method works great in the planning\nphase and the early stages, but\n\n136\n00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.200\nin the late stages,\nwhere I really have detailed information,\n\n137\n00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.280\nI need something better because I gotta\nworry about over allocating people, and\n\n138\n00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.490\ngiving people overtime,\nI gotta worry about that stuff.\n\n139\n00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.150\nAnd just punching it there in the research\nnames field, that's not gonna work.\n\n140\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.120\nSo I've got a few other\ntools that I can use.\n\n141\n00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.660\nThere's one that I'm gonna tell you about\nthat we're gonna save for another episode,\n\n142\n00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.430\nit's kind of a bigger one.\n\n143\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.140\nAnd then one that we'll use right here.\n\n144\n00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.200\nLet me show you.\n\n145\n00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.110\nSo when I come in and I pick an activity,\nlike here, clear and grub site,\n\n146\n00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.720\nI don't even know what grub site means,\nbut we're gonna clear and grub a site.\n\n147\n00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.500\nI need to assign some people to that.\n\n148\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.010\nWell, you can go up here\nto your Resource tab and\n\n149\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.330\nthere's what's called the Team Planner,\nand the Team Planner is awesome.\n\n150\n00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.070\nIt's so awesome that we're going\nto use it in another show, so\n\n151\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.170\nwe'll get a chance to see it.\n\n152\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.460\nBut it basically lays out\nin almost a calendar view.\n\n153\n00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.170\nYou can see all of your resources.\n\n154\n00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.850\nWhen they're busy, when they're not busy.\n\n155\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.589\nYou can kind of pick and choose from that.\n\n156\n00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.320\nThe team planner is really neat,\nreally cool,\n\n157\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.830\nwe definitely wanna cover that in depth,\nso I'm gonna save that one.\n\n158\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.610\nBut another tool that's available for\nus is right next to it, assign resources.\n\n159\n00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.140\nSo if you highlight an activity and\n\n160\n00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.000\nchoose assign resources,\nyou get this cool little pop-up.\n\n161\n00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.690\nAnd what the pop up does is it displays\nthe resources that are available to us and\n\n162\n00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.760\nit shows us some key information that's\nhandy in helping us make a decision.\n\n163\n00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.950\nThe first thing that it's showing\nus is our units and our cost.\n\n164\n00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.820\nOur units,\nhow much availability do they have?\n\n165\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.820\nIs this person available 100%\nof the time of my project?\n\n166\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.640\nOr are they only available 50%\nof the time on my project?\n\n167\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.030\nAnd you'll see, all of my guys are empty\nand that just means they're 100%.\n\n168\n00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.180\nThey're at the default.\n\n169\n00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.490\nIf somebody wasn't at the default\nit would show it in here and\n\n170\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.270\nI would know,\nthat person has limited availability.\n\n171\n00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.130\nSo if I have an effort driven task, and\n\n172\n00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.200\nI assign somebody who's\n50% availability on it,\n\n173\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.620\nit'll take twice as long as an activity\nfor somebody who has 100% availability.\n\n174\n00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.720\nSo that's going to\ninfluence my choice here.\n\n175\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.020\nIf I need to get it done fast,\nI'm not going to pick a part timer,\n\n176\n00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.970\nI'm going to pick a full timer.\n\n177\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.740\nOr a full timer and a part timer to get it\ndone even faster if it's effort driven.\n\n178\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.460\nIf it's not effort driven,\nthen it doesn't matter.\n\n179\n00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.860\nI just pick one of those people and\nthrow them in there.\n\n180\n00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.790\nAnd cost, I might have three people\n\n181\n00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.353\nthat are perfectly capable of\nachieving the same job, but\n\n182\n00:08:53.353 --> 00:08:58.000\none of them might be really expensive, one\nof them might be really inexpensive and\n\n183\n00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.410\nI might choose the inexpensive one to\nshave off some money from my project.\n\n184\n00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.190\nNow there's a trade off there.\n\n185\n00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.750\nThe person who's expensive is\nprobably better at their job.\n\n186\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.425\nI should hope.\n\n187\n00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:08.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the person who's less expensive is\n\n188\n00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.460\nprobably not as good at their job.\n\n189\n00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.240\nSo you're introducing risk,\nhere we get to make that decision.\n\n190\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.030\nSo it's all kind of laid out.\n\n191\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.250\nThe only negative here is it's\nshowing all of our resources.\n\n192\n00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.430\nAnd so, if you have a lot of resources,\n\n193\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.540\nit can be hard to find\nthe ones that you want.\n\n194\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.740\nSo you'll see that you have this\nresource list options up at the top,\n\n195\n00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.630\nwhere we can come in and\nwe can filter things.\n\n196\n00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.370\nAnd you can filter it by a few things.\n\n197\n00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.400\nLike filtering it right here by\ngroup is what I normally do.\n\n198\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.480\nIf your resources have\ngroups assigned to them.\n\n199\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.070\nSo you can group your IT guys together,\ngroup your accounting people together,\n\n200\n00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.870\nyou can filter by that group and\nthat makes life a lot easier.\n\n201\n00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:50.010\nYou can filter by a lot of other things,\ntoo, based on what kind of work complete,\n\n202\n00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.660\ndate range, created after,\nall sorts of other things.\n\n203\n00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.540\nNine times out of ten I\"m using\ngroup to reduce this down and\n\n204\n00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.290\nget just a certain amount of people.\n\n205\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.750\nAnd you create more filters.\n\n206\n00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.870\nYou can actually create\ncustom filters if you want.\n\n207\n00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.090\nSo you can create a filter that said just\nshow me people who's name start with A.\n\n208\n00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.110\nI don't know how useful that would be,\nbut you certainly could do it.\n\n209\n00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.600\nSo you can create all sorts\nof filters in there for that.\n\n210\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.720\nAnd then you can also choose\navailable to work and\n\n211\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.470\nspecify a certain amount of hours.\n\n212\n00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.460\nOnly show me people that are available\nto work eight hours a day.\n\n213\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.840\nIf somebody's part time,\nI don't even want to see them.\n\n214\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.600\nSo you can filter out based on that too.\n\n215\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.950\nThat helps to get those lists reduced and\n\n216\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.145\nkind of filter things down until\nyou only see a particular values.\n\n217\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.000\nNow, when we wanna assign somebody\nthe activity, we can come in here and\n\n218\n00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.520\nwe can choose them and\n\n219\n00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.120\nthen you just hit the assign button and\nit's going to assign them.\n\n220\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.750\nAnd see how the units\nin cost just filled in?\n\n221\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.740\nSo I can see that person has 100% and\ntheir cost is $0.\n\n222\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.730\nI can actually go in and\n\n223\n00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.980\nupdate their cost right from here\nbecause I know it's incorrect.\n\n224\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.100\nAnd so we can come in and punch that in if\nwe needed to by double clicking on them\n\n225\n00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.990\nand coming in and\nchanging their cost right there.\n\n226\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.330\nThen, oops,\nI'm messing with my chart here.\n\n227\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.065\nSo then we can go in and we can pick\nother people if we needed to and\n\n228\n00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.495\nstart to get them assigned.\n\n229\n00:11:07.495 --> 00:11:09.695\nSo I just did the electrical\ncontract manager.\n\n230\n00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:13.385\nI could come in here and pick the\nelectrical contractor and hit Assign, and\n\n231\n00:11:13.385 --> 00:11:14.565\nthey're now added too.\n\n232\n00:11:14.565 --> 00:11:16.705\nAnd I just start adding\nthe ones that I want.\n\n233\n00:11:16.705 --> 00:11:19.125\nOr I could take somebody and\nI could remove them.\n\n234\n00:11:19.125 --> 00:11:21.955\nAnother option is I could take\nsomebody and replace them.\n\n235\n00:11:21.955 --> 00:11:25.125\nThat's pretty cool because otherwise,\nI'd have to remove them and\n\n236\n00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:26.185\nthen add somebody else.\n\n237\n00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:27.460\nIt's two options.\n\n238\n00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.440\nHere I just choose Replace and\n\n239\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.620\nthen I'm able to come and\npick the person to replace them.\n\n240\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.340\nAnd see how it's listing out the cost?\n\n241\n00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.980\nThat's how we normally make the decision.\n\n242\n00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.890\nCost in units, that's what's gonna\ninfluence who it is that I'm gonna choose.\n\n243\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.390\nSo it makes it real easy to pick the best\nfit for this job, based on what I want.\n\n244\n00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.170\nI might be okay with it taking a little\nbit longer if I can get it done\n\n245\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.740\nfor less money.\n\n246\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.420\nOr I might be okay with\nspending more money,\n\n247\n00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.970\nif I know I can get the job done faster or\nmore reliably.\n\n248\n00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.598\nIf I wanna guarantee\na certain finish date,\n\n249\n00:11:54.598 --> 00:11:56.232\nI might wanna pay more\nto get better talent.\n\n250\n00:11:58.761 --> 00:12:02.590\nOne of my favorite features\nthough is this button right here.\n\n251\n00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.110\nThe graph.\n\n252\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:09.230\nThe graph is what we had\nprior to the team planner.\n\n253\n00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.580\nThe team planner wasn't always in Project.\n\n254\n00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.475\nAnd so before we had the team planner,\nwe had this graph.\n\n255\n00:12:13.475 --> 00:12:16.530\nAnd when I clicked on it,\nwhat you'll notice is that this\n\n256\n00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.730\nlittle box up here down here\nin the bottom of my chart, and\n\n257\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.970\nwhat it's showing me is\nthe electrical contractor.\n\n258\n00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.510\nAnd as I scroll around on this thing and\nstart picking these different people,\n\n259\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.030\nit's gonna be showing me\ninformation about them and\n\n260\n00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.940\ntheir availability, so I can spot whether\nor not they're being over allocated.\n\n261\n00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.960\nAnd I've got my screen\nkinda scaled weird so\n\n262\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.990\nhere let me change this around\na little bit so you guys can see it.\n\n263\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.360\nSo here's laying out this graph and\n\n264\n00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.990\nsee my electrical contract manager\nwhere I've got him assigned.\n\n265\n00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.070\nHere he's assigned for eight hour days,\nhe's at 100% utilization.\n\n266\n00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.380\nBut on this thing I've got\nover 400% utilization.\n\n267\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.220\nI might have gone just a little\nbit overboard on that one.\n\n268\n00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:57.992\nWell, I don't know about.\n\n269\n00:12:57.992 --> 00:12:59.729\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> 22 hours in a 24 hours day.\n\n270\n00:12:59.729 --> 00:13:00.711\n[CROSSTALK] Pretty difficult.\n\n271\n00:13:00.711 --> 00:13:02.510\n>> Yeah, he's gonna have a hard\ntime pulling that one off.\n\n272\n00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.330\nHe'd have to be really talented but, so,\n\n273\n00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.170\nhey, maybe that's not\nthe person I want to use.\n\n274\n00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.040\nAnd so we can start to take a look at some\nof the other guys, and you just pick them,\n\n275\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.460\nso I could say,\nmaybe the manager's not available,\n\n276\n00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.510\nlet me just try the regular contractor,\nand hit graph, and there's their graph,\n\n277\n00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.030\nand well, they're a little over too.\n\n278\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.862\nLet me just kind of keep hunting\naround until I can find somebody.\n\n279\n00:13:22.862 --> 00:13:24.720\nHave I over-allocated everybody?\n\n280\n00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.630\n>> Every single person.\n\n281\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.130\n>> Apparently I have.\n\n282\n00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.640\nSo that's gonna be a problem to work out,\nisn't it?\n\n283\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.840\nSo, yeah.\n\n284\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.690\nWell, actually you know what, it's not, oh\nbecause I haven't assigned these people.\n\n285\n00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.160\nI do need to assign them before\nthe graph goes active and so\n\n286\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.290\nright now it's [INAUDIBLE] to these\nother guys, so let me back out of that.\n\n287\n00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.860\nNow, one thing that does\nslightly annoy me with this\n\n288\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.200\nis the graph stays up after you're done,\nright, after you've kinda moved on.\n\n289\n00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.450\nSo, if you want to get rid of that graph,\n\n290\n00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.970\nyou need to go up to your View tab and\nit's over here on the right, the Details.\n\n291\n00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.630\nAnd see how the details are set\nto show this resource graph, and\n\n292\n00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.370\nyou can change it to\nsomething else if you want or\n\n293\n00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.720\nyou can just get rid of it all together\nand get back to your original view.\n\n294\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.780\nBut yeah, we can jump back in here and\nkind of reassign that.\n\n295\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.040\nLet me run through that process again.\n\n296\n00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.540\nSo I'll take Install Storm Drainage,\nI'm gonna go to Resource, and\n\n297\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.680\nAssign Resources.\n\n298\n00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.210\nAnd I can see who's currently assigned,\nand\n\n299\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.970\nI can assign other people if I take\nsomebody and I pull up their graph.\n\n300\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.280\nLike I'll take the elevator\ncontractor this time, and graph them.\n\n301\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.930\nAnd so, oh sorry, forgot to assign them.\n\n302\n00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.620\nI keep forgetting to assign them first.\n\n303\n00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.160\nSo I'll assign that elevator contractor\nand now if I pull their graft,\n\n304\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.960\nit should switch to show me and\nyou know it's not switching.\n\n305\n00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.750\nWe can scroll down.\n\n306\n00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.440\nThere we go.\n\n307\n00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.640\nSo I get that elevator contractor.\n\n308\n00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.560\nI just chose the graft and scrolled down\nwith my mouse wheel to see that other\n\n309\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.660\nperson and I can see that person\nright here is not over allocated.\n\n310\n00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.540\nThey're given eight hours to\nwork on each of those days.\n\n311\n00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.900\nBut notice Friday,\nFriday they have no work.\n\n312\n00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.160\nThey're not doing anything Friday.\n\n313\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.690\nSo if I have an activity that's taking\nplace on Friday, I can assign them.\n\n314\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.210\nI know they're available and\nI'm not going to oversubscribe them or\n\n315\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.760\nover allocate them.\n\n316\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.340\nSo pretty cool utility.\n\n317\n00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.450\n>> It really is.\n\n318\n00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.150\nAnd there's one other view that\nwe wanna take a look at as well.\n\n319\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.247\nDon, when you go back to that Details,\nwhere you had that under Format?\n\n320\n00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:14.987\nAnd the, where is it?\n\n321\n00:15:14.987 --> 00:15:17.828\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh, hang on, I'm in my wrong grid here.\n\n322\n00:15:17.828 --> 00:15:18.388\nOkay.\n\n323\n00:15:18.388 --> 00:15:19.830\n>> And then.\n\n324\n00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.528\n>> Go to View and Details, there we go.\n\n325\n00:15:21.528 --> 00:15:24.357\n>> What we wanna take a look at\nis that task form, which actually\n\n326\n00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:28.170\ngives you the most usage when you're\nactually talking an assignment.\n\n327\n00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:33.080\nSo here you can change the effort driven\nwhether you're manually scheduling it and\n\n328\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.120\nyou can actually see the number of hours\nas well as the duration that group can\n\n329\n00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.130\nbe assigned.\n\n330\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.560\nIt's right here that you can\nactually go ahead an manipulate and\n\n331\n00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.710\nchange a lot of different things.\n\n332\n00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.510\nYou'll see a lot of information\nabout the task as well as that\n\n333\n00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.850\nresource it's assigned to.\n\n334\n00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.940\n>> Yeah and you can quickly\nadd more resources right here.\n\n335\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.440\nYou can add existing resources or\nyou can create new ones.\n\n336\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.030\nSo I might have John Doe,\nI might have Jane Smith, and so\n\n337\n00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.520\nI'm creating new resources on the fly.\n\n338\n00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.570\nAnd they're created, and\nthey're assigned to the activity, and\n\n339\n00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.510\nI can come in here and\nadjust their units, so maybe John and\n\n340\n00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.800\nJane are only working 50% of the time,\nand so I can punch them in.\n\n341\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.030\nI don't want to punch in their work\n\n342\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.160\nbecause I want that to\nbe auto calculated out.\n\n343\n00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.610\nSo now we start getting them assigned.\n\n344\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.180\nAnd you can double click on them to jump\nto their individual settings and go in and\n\n345\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.200\nset all the other values to be a little\nmore specific on them if you need to.\n\n346\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.720\nIt's all right here.\n\n347\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.440\nYou can go about this more than one way.\n\n348\n00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.060\nIn the previous episode,\nwe did it all from the resource sheet.\n\n349\n00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.760\nBut here we're doing it\nright in the Gantt chart,\n\n350\n00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.570\nright in the activity list,\nand right in our Details pane.\n\n351\n00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.720\nYou pretty much figure out which way\nis easiest for you and stick with it.\n\n352\n00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.590\nBut just know that all\nthese options are here.\n\n353\n00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.420\nAnd we haven't even touched\nthe team planner yet, so\n\n354\n00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.542\nthat's a cool one that we\ndefinitely want to remember.\n\n355\n00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:48.200\nAll right, Ronnie as far as\nassigning out my resources, the only\n\n356\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.855\nother thing we need to remember is to keep\nan eye out for over allocated resources.\n\n357\n00:16:52.855 --> 00:16:54.780\nSo if I look here at clear and\n\n358\n00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.420\ngrub sight I've got that little red\nfigure over there on the left side and\n\n359\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.840\nit's telling me the task is over\nallocated, right click for options.\n\n360\n00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.950\nAnd if you right click on it,\nit'll give you some options here.\n\n361\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.350\nFix in task inspector or\nreschedule to available date.\n\n362\n00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:14.440\nIf I know that the person I've assigned\nit to I absolutely have to have,\n\n363\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.580\nI can reschedule and it'll move that task\nto the next time that person's available.\n\n364\n00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:24.050\nThat's gonna push my schedules by\nmy project's completion date back.\n\n365\n00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.120\nThat may be okay.\n\n366\n00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.610\nIf this is one of those projects where\nthey say just get it done as soon as\n\n367\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.189\nyou can, then it's okay to\nmove it back a little bit.\n\n368\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.110\nBut if I'm gonna finish on a certain date,\nthat's not gonna work for me.\n\n369\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.240\nSo you could go to the task inspector,\nand it's gonna show us a little bit more\n\n370\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.330\ninformation about that task and who it is\nthat's over allocated, and what I'm gonna\n\n371\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.881\nneed to do and see what it's offering\nto do to take me to that team planner.\n\n372\n00:17:45.881 --> 00:17:48.286\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It keeps popping up cuz it's so\n\n373\n00:17:48.286 --> 00:17:53.670\nawesome, but we could also just\ntake this activity and go into our\n\n374\n00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.500\nresource assignment screen, and we could\ntake the people that are assigned, and\n\n375\n00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.310\nfigure out who it is\nthat's over allocated.\n\n376\n00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.232\nAnd I think in my case,\nboth of them are over allocated, so\n\n377\n00:18:03.232 --> 00:18:05.031\nwe can find that out from the graph.\n\n378\n00:18:05.031 --> 00:18:09.606\nSo I can see right there, my electric\ncontractor is over allocated, and\n\n379\n00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:14.430\nwe can find there we go the electric\nmanager, he's over allocated also.\n\n380\n00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.120\nThey're both over allocated in my case.\n\n381\n00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.630\nSo I can come in and add new people and\nmaybe those new people are gonna be just\n\n382\n00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.230\ncompletely new or\nmaybe it's somebody else in here.\n\n383\n00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.390\nI might wanna come in and\nchoose them and re-assign them.\n\n384\n00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:31.670\nReplace them with somebody else\nbased on what my needs are.\n\n385\n00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.370\nIt's really all just about figuring\nout what solution is gonna work\n\n386\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.630\nbest now that we've over allocated.\n\n387\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.458\nAnd we'll see later on in our reporting\nshows where there's other ways to see\n\n388\n00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:45.580\nover allocation, because I visually\nsaw this little red stick man, but\n\n389\n00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.525\nwhat if i have 2000 activities?\n\n390\n00:18:47.525 --> 00:18:49.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'd have to scroll all the way down to\n\n391\n00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.970\nlook for that stick man.\n\n392\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.200\nSo there's some special reports\nthat can show over-allocation also.\n\n393\n00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.480\nAnd we just need to go and\nreassign resources for that.\n\n394\n00:18:57.058 --> 00:18:57.590\nAll right, Ronnie,\n\n395\n00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.510\ncan you think of anything else we need\nto throw in on assigning resources.\n\n396\n00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.180\n>> No, those are some of the different\nways, remember, just try them out, see\n\n397\n00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.470\nwhich one's gonna be the best one for you\nto work with, and you'll start noticing\n\n398\n00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:13.355\nthe way that Don actually did that, at the\nbeginning, fairly easy to just type those.\n\n399\n00:19:13.355 --> 00:19:17.255\nBut later on you still have to go back and\nchange some options so you may find\n\n400\n00:19:17.255 --> 00:19:19.765\nyour particular way of actually assigning\nthat's going to be the best way for\n\n401\n00:19:19.765 --> 00:19:21.935\nyou, so use them.\n\n402\n00:19:21.935 --> 00:19:24.285\n>> All right, well ladies and gentleman,\nwe'll go and wrap this episode up here.\n\n403\n00:19:24.285 --> 00:19:27.155\nDefinitely stay tuned for\nour team planner episode, it's fine I\n\n404\n00:19:27.155 --> 00:19:29.655\nknow I mentioned it like ten times now and\npeople are like why don't you show it now.\n\n405\n00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:33.135\nWe just want to do it justice, so\nyou get to see it in the next episode.\n\n406\n00:19:33.135 --> 00:19:34.845\nBut as far as resource assignments,\n\n407\n00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:37.810\nwe showed you several different\nmethods that are all very effective.\n\n408\n00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:38.610\nAnd pretty easy to use.\n\n409\n00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.680\nDefiantly take advantage of those.\n\n410\n00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.950\nWell signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n411\n00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:44.640\n>> I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n412\n00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.709\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n413\n00:19:45.709 --> 00:19:46.209\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.641\nand welcome back to another\nepisode of iTProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:16.890\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.650\nBack again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.400\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.840\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.070\nWe are ready and excited for\nanother day of project and\n\n9\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.510\nsince we've actually been building up to\nit, we're going to actually look at your\n\n10\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.780\nfavorite part of the project,\nteam planner, I think what it's called.\n\n11\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.990\n>> That last episode we filmed\nwas kind of tough for me, right.\n\n12\n00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.090\nI shamelessly plugged the team\nplanner several times.\n\n13\n00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.720\nIn the last episode we covered\nhow to add resources to tasks.\n\n14\n00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.900\nHow do you assign a person or\na material or whatever to a task and\n\n15\n00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.280\nhow do you check for over-allocations and\nreplace people and all that?\n\n16\n00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.350\nAnd we did it all without\nthe team planner.\n\n17\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.600\nAnd we did that because\nit's on the exam that way.\n\n18\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.550\nAnd we gotta make sure\nwe cover everything.\n\n19\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.880\nBut I'll you guys, as soon as Microsoft\nreleased the team planner in Project,\n\n20\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.496\nI stopped using every other method.\n\n21\n00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:03.989\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is the only method that I use to\n\n22\n00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.764\nassign people anymore.\n\n23\n00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.920\nBut it does come down to\npeople's personal preference.\n\n24\n00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.150\nDuring the early stages of a project\nduring just the quick planning or\n\n25\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.790\nwhatever I will use the methods I showed\nyou in that last video just to kind of\n\n26\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.610\ntype in some of those values, but once\nI start to have an idea of real people\n\n27\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.750\nthat are going to be performing my tasks I\nusually switch over to the team planner.\n\n28\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.760\nNow what do I mean by real people?\n\n29\n00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.640\nIn the early planning days,\nyou might have a task where you say,\n\n30\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.280\nyou know what,\nI need a network engineer for this task.\n\n31\n00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.110\nAnd so I'm just gonna create\na generic network engineer resource.\n\n32\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.180\nAnd I'm gonna assign that to this task.\n\n33\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.130\nBut then, as your planning phase\nstarts to near completion and\n\n34\n00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.410\nyou're getting ready for execution,\nthat's when you reach out to your PMO,\n\n35\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.290\nor your HR department,\nor you put out your ads.\n\n36\n00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.310\nAnd you contract, or hire, or\n\n37\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.100\nyou use internally an actual person\nto be that network engineer.\n\n38\n00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.750\nAnd so I find out that I don't just\nhave a generic network engineer.\n\n39\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.420\nI have Ronnie Wong.\n\n40\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.050\nAnd so Ronnie's my real resource,\nI need to know his calendar.\n\n41\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.420\nWhen are his vacation days, what hours\ndoes he work, everything starts to change\n\n42\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.080\nbecause now it's Ronnie specifically,\nnot generic network engineer number one.\n\n43\n00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.140\nAnd when that happens, now we've got to\nstart realigning our schedule a bit and\n\n44\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.130\nthat's when the team planner really helps.\n\n45\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.713\nNow if you watched that last episode,\nyou probably noticed where there\n\n46\n00:02:22.713 --> 00:02:25.997\nwere some parts where I had a little\nbit of difficulty doing things\n\n47\n00:02:25.997 --> 00:02:29.837\nlike seeing whether somebody was\nalready over-allocated or not, right?\n\n48\n00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:32.843\nSo if I have a task and\nI wanna assign some employees to it,\n\n49\n00:02:32.843 --> 00:02:36.440\nthe interface is kind of cumbersome\nto be able to view that.\n\n50\n00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.530\nThe team planner fixes that.\n\n51\n00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.390\nSo here I have my construction project\npulled up that I just whipped up\n\n52\n00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.480\nfrom one of the templates\ninside of project.\n\n53\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.630\nAnd you can see where we've got\na couple activities here and\n\n54\n00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.080\nthey've assigned resources to it.\n\n55\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.480\nAnd I know I can scroll over here to\nthe resources column or resource names.\n\n56\n00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.770\nAnd I can see that people or\nstuff have been assigned to it.\n\n57\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.980\nSo you can see general management,\nproject management, the scheduler,\n\n58\n00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.290\nthe project manager.\n\n59\n00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.310\nRight, so each person being assigned this.\n\n60\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.790\nAnd some of them are given, you know,\nlike a percentage of utilization.\n\n61\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.634\nSo they're only hear 10%.\n\n62\n00:03:09.634 --> 00:03:13.750\nThat means 90% of the time it's still\navailable to use for other activities.\n\n63\n00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.000\nThat's where this gets really hard,\n\n64\n00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.100\ncuz we can't just look at whether there's\ntwo activities scheduled at the same time.\n\n65\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.250\nThe person might be 10% on one and\n90% on the other,\n\n66\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.940\nand now you've got two at the same time\nbut it's fine because it adds up to 100%.\n\n67\n00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.940\nThat's something we don't\nreally see in this view.\n\n68\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.300\nI mean, you do see it if you sit here and\ndo the math.\n\n69\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.450\nBut it's not very easy to spot that.\n\n70\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.510\nIt's really hard to spot it\nif they've got 10% here and\n\n71\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.400\nthe other 90% is way down at the bottom\nof your list, a thousand tasks later.\n\n72\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.070\nRight, now you don't get\nit at a glance at all.\n\n73\n00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.560\nSo, for\nmanaging our basic team utilization.\n\n74\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.720\nThis view, it certainly works,\nbut it's not ideal, all right?\n\n75\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.300\nInstead, we can switch\nto our team planner, and\n\n76\n00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.400\nit's gonna show us a much\nbetter detail of this.\n\n77\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.740\nSo if I take somebody,\n\n78\n00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.560\nlike here where I've got this\noverallocation on Submit bond right?\n\n79\n00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.380\nAnd if I look over here, I can see\nit's got GC project management and\n\n80\n00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.080\nGC general management assigned to it.\n\n81\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.330\nThose are the two resources, and\n\n82\n00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.180\nGC general management is\nonly 25% on this one.\n\n83\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.810\nBut it's all allocated that\nmeans one of those two or\n\n84\n00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.330\nboth of those two resources\nare over-allocated.\n\n85\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.850\nWhich one is it?\n\n86\n00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.170\nI don't know.\nIt doesn't tell me.\n\n87\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.790\nRight?\nBut\n\n88\n00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.510\neven if I jump into the task detail view,\n\n89\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.830\nit doesn't give me much\nbetter information here.\n\n90\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.130\nWhen we jump into the task inspector,\nand we start to look,\n\n91\n00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.170\nit's gonna give you some basic details.\n\n92\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.230\nIf I can stretch this out a bit here.\n\n93\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.490\nTo let me know that I've got resources\nover-allocated and it is telling me that\n\n94\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.360\nit is actually GC Project Management\nthat's over-allocated, so I can spot that.\n\n95\n00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.080\nAnd, does it tell me how\nthey're over allocated though?\n\n96\n00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.090\nNot really.\n\n97\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.740\nSo, what I can do is, instead of relying\non that I can go to my Resource tab, and\n\n98\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.450\nI can click on Team Planner.\n\n99\n00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.160\nAnd that's gonna take me to\nthe Team Planner view which is\n\n100\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.580\nsimilar to the Gantt Chart.\n\n101\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.480\nThe Gantt chart shows you tasks, and\n\n102\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.270\nthen a graphical representation of\nwhere they fall on the calendar.\n\n103\n00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.050\nHere, it gives me a list of resources.\n\n104\n00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.787\nAnd then over here, it shows me well,\n\n105\n00:05:03.787 --> 00:05:07.760\nwhere that activities\nfall on their calendar.\n\n106\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.365\nSo, I can see GC general management,\nright here.\n\n107\n00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:13.355\nAnd what they're doing\neach day of the week,\n\n108\n00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.335\nwhich activities are assigned to them.\n\n109\n00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:19.565\nAnd if I look along the line here,\neverything is nice and blue or gray.\n\n110\n00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:21.575\nGray means that something\nis going right now,\n\n111\n00:05:21.575 --> 00:05:23.405\nblue means it's something\ncoming in the future.\n\n112\n00:05:23.405 --> 00:05:26.335\nAnd so if I can see all that\nstuff laid out, and that's fine.\n\n113\n00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:30.325\nBut I can see GC project\nmanagement is over-allocated.\n\n114\n00:05:30.325 --> 00:05:34.250\nI know they're over-allocated because\nthey're red and then I can see right here\n\n115\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.520\nwhere they've got two activities\nscheduled at the same time.\n\n116\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.420\nSubmit bond and\n\n117\n00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.080\ninsurance documents is going on at\nthe same time as obtain building permits.\n\n118\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.370\nI've got an overlap right there.\n\n119\n00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.420\nI don't have to scroll through this\nbig list to find other activities or\n\n120\n00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.400\nanything like that because I'm seeing\neverything that GC project management is\n\n121\n00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.340\ndoing on this particular day.\n\n122\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.860\nSo, super easy to spot over-allocations.\n\n123\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.630\nIt's also easy to spot tasks that don't\nhave any resources assigned to it yet.\n\n124\n00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.300\nNotice down here at\nthe bottom half of my screen,\n\n125\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.510\nlet me just stretch this up here\na little bit, I've got unassigned tasks.\n\n126\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.630\nIf I start creating more tasks and\n\n127\n00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.220\nnobodies assigned to them\nit'll show up right here.\n\n128\n00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.250\nAnd so I'll be able to spot area's\nlike that where somethings just not\n\n129\n00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.350\nassigned yet.\n\n130\n00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.155\nSo for example.\n\n131\n00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:23.130\nLet's clean this up cause\nthis a big project here.\n\n132\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.550\nLets do a new one.\n\n133\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.060\nI'm gonna create a new project here and\nso this is just gonna be I don't know,\n\n134\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.370\nsome kind of computer project.\n\n135\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:39.120\nAnd inside of it I'll have simple things\nlike setup network and setup PCs okay?\n\n136\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.690\nAnd so I know I'm going to\nneed a few resources on this,\n\n137\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.360\nI might say I need a network engineer and\na desktop engineer.\n\n138\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.320\nThese are gonna be my two people that\nI'm gonna need to be able to perform\n\n139\n00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.100\nthese activities, all right?\n\n140\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.150\nAnd for the duration, maybe setting\nup the network takes 10 days,\n\n141\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.965\nsetting up the PCs takes 5 days, and these\nare all gonna roll up under this one task.\n\n142\n00:06:59.965 --> 00:07:01.555\nSo we'll just indent that.\n\n143\n00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:03.215\nThere we go.\nSo here's my project.\n\n144\n00:07:03.215 --> 00:07:06.675\nAnd these two could\nhappen at the same time.\n\n145\n00:07:06.675 --> 00:07:08.515\nI don't need them to be\none after the other.\n\n146\n00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:09.745\nThey can happen at the same time.\n\n147\n00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:10.805\nThat's fine.\n\n148\n00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:14.055\nAnd, from here,\nI've got my project set up.\n\n149\n00:07:14.055 --> 00:07:16.140\nAnd it looks like I've got\na ten-day project ahead of me.\n\n150\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.870\nRight?\n\n151\n00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.250\nI can jump over to my resource sheet.\n\n152\n00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.240\nAnd here's where I can\nstart setting up people.\n\n153\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.370\nAnd so right now I've got this\ngeneric network engineer,\n\n154\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.020\nthis generic desktop engineer.\n\n155\n00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.750\nBut later on, I actually find out that\nhey, I'm gonna have Ronnie Wong on staff.\n\n156\n00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.670\nAnd I'm gonna have myself on staff too.\n\n157\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.090\nSo these are my employees.\n\n158\n00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.900\nAnd Ronnie and I we're both trained up to\nbe network engineers or desktop engineers.\n\n159\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.100\nSo we could really perform\nboth of those roles.\n\n160\n00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.300\nThat's why I didn't just rename these\nbecause I might have one person who\n\n161\n00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.800\nfits more then one of those roles so\nI usually keep them laying around.\n\n162\n00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.310\nDifferent people handle\nthat in different ways.\n\n163\n00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.468\nSo now, I need to go back and reassign\nthese activities to these new people and\n\n164\n00:07:53.468 --> 00:07:55.367\nI can use the team planner for that.\n\n165\n00:07:55.367 --> 00:08:00.048\nIf I go to resource and team planner,\nhere I can see the network engineer and\n\n166\n00:08:00.048 --> 00:08:01.549\nthe desktop engineer.\n\n167\n00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:06.066\nAnd I've got these unscheduled tasks\nfloating right here beside them.\n\n168\n00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:09.468\nThese are tasks that don't have\na particular day to occur on yet.\n\n169\n00:08:09.468 --> 00:08:12.682\nI set a duration for them, but\nthey're auto scheduled and\n\n170\n00:08:12.682 --> 00:08:17.780\nthey're just kind of floating out there,\nnot assigned to a particular day.\n\n171\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.580\nAnd, now, the reason it does that is,\n\n172\n00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.730\nI can take a look at this network engineer\nand I can look at their schedule.\n\n173\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.160\nAnd I can say,\nwhen are they available to do the work?\n\n174\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.810\nIf I had a calendar on the network\nengineer that blocked out\n\n175\n00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.420\na particular week.\n\n176\n00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.220\nIt would be blocked out right\nhere in the Team Manager.\n\n177\n00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.350\nAnd so I can see,\ndon't assign it to that person that week,\n\n178\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.780\nassign it to somebody else.\n\n179\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.450\nAnd all I have to do is take that task,\nand I can drag it and\n\n180\n00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.250\ndrop it wherever I need\nhere in the calendar.\n\n181\n00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.370\nAnd I can even take it to somebody else,\nright?\n\n182\n00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.910\nSo, maybe I give Setup a Network\nto Ronnie, cuz he likes networks.\n\n183\n00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.570\nAnd I'll bite the bullet and\ntake setting up the PCs.\n\n184\n00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.410\nAnd I can just drag those out and\nset them out there.\n\n185\n00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.280\nNow I do have a slight problem,\nthis little green line represents today.\n\n186\n00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.000\nI'm setting these tasks to start in\nthe past, and if it's gray, that's kind of\n\n187\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.160\nyour indicator that hey, this is\nsupposed to all ready be happening.\n\n188\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.020\nSo a good project plans for the future,\nlet's move that ahead, there we go, and\n\n189\n00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.660\nnow I've got them scheduled out there.\n\n190\n00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.790\nSo I'm quickly and easily able to\nmove these tasks between people and\n\n191\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.700\nassign them out.\n\n192\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.150\nAnd that's one of the easiest ways\nto solve an overallocation, right?\n\n193\n00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.560\nLet's go back to my Gantt chart.\n\n194\n00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.740\nAnd let's say that in haste,\nI wasn't really thinking about it much and\n\n195\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.910\nI just assigned everything to Ronnie,\nright?\n\n196\n00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.690\nRonnie can do a lot of work,\nso there you go.\n\n197\n00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.570\nSo, now Ronnie's doing all\nthe work in this project.\n\n198\n00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.090\nWell, Ronnie is overallocated, okay?\n\n199\n00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.190\nNow, it shows me that right here\nI can see he's overallocated.\n\n200\n00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.780\nAt a glance,\n\n201\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.360\nit's very easy to spot where the problem\nis because it's a small project.\n\n202\n00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.190\nBut in a large project, it would be very\nhard to spot where that overallocation is.\n\n203\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.930\nSo I can just jump right back to the\nTeam Planner, and I can look at Ronnie.\n\n204\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.230\nRonnie is in red, so\nI know he's got some overallocation.\n\n205\n00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.920\nAnd I can see Setup Network and\nSetup PCs right there, and you know,\n\n206\n00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.430\nmy font switched really small again.\n\n207\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.330\nLet me bump that font size up so that we\ncan actually read some of this stuff.\n\n208\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.180\nThere we go.\n\n209\n00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:12.030\nSo, now I can see Ronnie right there,\nand I can see over here on July 19th,\n\n210\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.770\nhe's scheduled two\nthings at the same time.\n\n211\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.600\nHe's got a Setup the Network and\nSetup the PC's, and\n\n212\n00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.680\nit's got that red block around it.\n\n213\n00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.090\nNotice how the red block does\nnot extend to the second week.\n\n214\n00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:29.380\nRonnie's not overallocated for\nthe entire Setup the Network activity.\n\n215\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.060\nHe's only overallocated for\nthat first week.\n\n216\n00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.160\nSo how do I correct this?\n\n217\n00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.564\nWell, there's a few different\nways that I can correct it.\n\n218\n00:10:37.564 --> 00:10:39.510\nLet's start with the easy ones.\n\n219\n00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.520\nThe easy one is,\ngive one of these jobs to somebody else.\n\n220\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.675\nHe's overallocated this week, I can just\ntake Setup PC's, move that down to me,\n\n221\n00:10:47.675 --> 00:10:49.770\nover-allocation is gone.\n\n222\n00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.460\nNow I'll do the work and\neverybody's green and happy.\n\n223\n00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.740\nBut, if that doesn't work,\n\n224\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.770\nwell maybe I don't have another person,\nwhat's my choice then?\n\n225\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.630\nI can move one of these tasks back, or\nmove one of them forward for that matter.\n\n226\n00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.730\nSo I could say, you know what, I'll just\ndelay setting up the network for a week.\n\n227\n00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.040\nOr I'll delay setting up the PCs for\ntwo weeks.\n\n228\n00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.360\nI probably don't want that.\n\n229\n00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.190\nSo, we probably push the network back,\nand there we go, allocation solved.\n\n230\n00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.850\nSo, the cool part about the Team Planner,\nyou get really good visibility,\n\n231\n00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.550\nit's a calendar for each person.\n\n232\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.730\nWhat they're doing on what day, and\nreally easy to drag and drop and\n\n233\n00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.550\nmove things around.\n\n234\n00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.560\nThat's great.\n\n235\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.410\nAnd then two, it's a GUI, so corrections\nare simple, I don't have to type anything,\n\n236\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.000\nI just drag them and move them, right?\n\n237\n00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.080\nSo at a glance status,\nand easy what you see is\n\n238\n00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.260\nwhat you get calendar settings for these\ntasks, it really does make life easy.\n\n239\n00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.030\nAnd it also saves you from the pitfall\nof having a task with nobody assigned\n\n240\n00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.150\nto it, right?\n\n241\n00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.330\nSo maybe one day I'm in a meeting and\nsomebody says, hey Don,\n\n242\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.930\nhave you planned for\nsetting up battery backups?\n\n243\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.100\nAnd I say ooh, no I didn't.\n\n244\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.864\nSo let me add that.\n\n245\n00:11:56.864 --> 00:12:01.640\nI'm gonna put in here,\nSetup Battery Backups, right?\n\n246\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.340\nAnd I say all right, well, that'll\nprobably just take somebody two days.\n\n247\n00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.980\nSo I'm just gonna pop that in here,\nand I set it.\n\n248\n00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.270\nAnd I'm like, all right,\nI'll deal with that one later.\n\n249\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.860\nAnd then I forget about it.\n\n250\n00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.040\nIn a project that has 1,500 activities.\n\n251\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.450\nIt's easy to have ones that don't\nhave anybody assigned to them,\n\n252\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:18.970\nyou lose sight of it.\n\n253\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.650\nAnd so, then all of a sudden you\nget to that point, your like,\n\n254\n00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:22.485\nwho's gonna work on this?\n\n255\n00:12:22.485 --> 00:12:25.560\nOoh, I forgot to assign somebody,\nI didn't get the resource.\n\n256\n00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.060\nNow I gotta get an extra resource.\n\n257\n00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.330\nMy budget starts to go up and\nthat becomes a real problem.\n\n258\n00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.270\nWell, I can just jump right\nback over to that Team Planner.\n\n259\n00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.090\nAnd I can see right down here\nat the bottom of my screen,\n\n260\n00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.390\nI've got unassigned tasks.\n\n261\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.110\nAnd it tells me how many.\n\n262\n00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.620\nI've got one,\nSetup Battery Backups, right?\n\n263\n00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.090\nIt's just floating out out there,\nnobody's assigned to it.\n\n264\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.050\nI need to give that to somebody.\n\n265\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.490\nAnd it's floating over\nhere in the left column,\n\n266\n00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.970\nbecause I didn't set a date for it.\n\n267\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.070\nLet's say I set a date for it.\n\n268\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.210\nIf I go back to my GANTT chart,\nand I take this one and\n\n269\n00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.990\nI say this one is gonna happen,\nwe'll schedule it out here.\n\n270\n00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.170\nOkay, so now it's got a date.\n\n271\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.180\nNow when I go back to that Team Planner.\n\n272\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.660\nInstead of floating over here on the left\ncolumn, which means it's unassigned and\n\n273\n00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.210\ndoesn't have a date,\nnow it's showing a date.\n\n274\n00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.190\nNow, why is that important?\n\n275\n00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.020\nJust because nobody's assigned to it,\n\n276\n00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.290\nI might have a particular date\nit has to happen on, right?\n\n277\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.780\nI've gotta have those battery backups\nset up before I can set up the network.\n\n278\n00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.400\nMaybe there's some kind\nof dependency there.\n\n279\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.960\nSo I might have a date, and\n\n280\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.150\nthat's when it's gonna appear right\nover here in this calendar view.\n\n281\n00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.660\nBut if it's completely flexible,\nI can put it wherever I want.\n\n282\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.220\nWe don't set a date that\nappears right here, and\n\n283\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.470\nthat gives us the flexibility to move it.\n\n284\n00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.398\nI can still move it to\na different date if I want.\n\n285\n00:13:39.398 --> 00:13:42.940\nIf I wanna assign this to me, right?\n\n286\n00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.720\nI can bring bring this up here,\nand assign it to Don Pezet.\n\n287\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.440\nI can still move it forward too, or\nbackwards, or wherever we wanted to go.\n\n288\n00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.370\nSo we've got that flexibility to\nbe able to reassign these things.\n\n289\n00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.220\nAnd you can just sit here all day long and\nkinda rearrange your project.\n\n290\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.080\nTo get it where you've got the right\npeople working on the right jobs\n\n291\n00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.250\nat the right time.\n\n292\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.650\nThat's the real glory of the Team Planner.\n\n293\n00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.300\nYeah, the graphical user interface\njust makes it a lot easier and\n\n294\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.840\nyou can see multiple\nresources at the same time.\n\n295\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.050\nWhen we have it all kind of zoomed in,\nit doesn't look like that, but\n\n296\n00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.360\nimagine if you had 10 or 15 people.\n\n297\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.164\nAnd you weren't really sure where\nthe overallocation can happen.\n\n298\n00:14:19.164 --> 00:14:23.000\nWell, by using that Team Planner,\nyou can see a lot more on your screen.\n\n299\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.060\nAnd then just use that click and\n\n300\n00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.200\ndrag to be able to move\nsome of these tasks around.\n\n301\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.755\nBut Don, we were talking about earlier\nthat that can also cause problems at\n\n302\n00:14:29.755 --> 00:14:30.370\ntimes, right?\n\n303\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:36.030\nYeah, you do have to be careful because\nactivities are oftentimes linked,\n\n304\n00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.720\nthey're linked one after the other.\n\n305\n00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.770\nAnd so when you start messing\naround here in the Team Planner,\n\n306\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:40.670\nthat can cause some problems.\n\n307\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.030\nLet me show you an example.\n\n308\n00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.616\nSo if I jump back to my task view,\nand let's say that\n\n309\n00:14:46.616 --> 00:14:52.180\nBattery Backups have to be done\nprior to setting up the PCs.\n\n310\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.486\nThat's just the order\nit's got to be done in.\n\n311\n00:14:54.486 --> 00:15:00.069\nSo, what I would do is, I would set\nup the PCs to have a predecessor.\n\n312\n00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:02.380\nOops, I just went backwards,\nthat's not gonna help me, is it?\n\n313\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:08.420\nSo, I would set a predecessor to say that\nthe Battery Backups have to be done first.\n\n314\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:10.950\nThere.\n\n315\n00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.930\nAnd then the PCs can be set up.\n\n316\n00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.080\nAnd so when I set that, see how it\ncreated that dependency link for me.\n\n317\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.490\nSo now I've got where setting up\nthe Backups happens first, and\n\n318\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.600\nthen setting up the PCs, right?\n\n319\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.360\nWhen I jump to my Team Planner.\n\n320\n00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:28.640\nI can see what's assigned to me.\n\n321\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.960\nAnd see how I don't see the links?\n\n322\n00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.940\nI don't see the dependencies or\nwhatever that's between them.\n\n323\n00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.950\nSo if I decide, man,\nDon's not doing anything this week.\n\n324\n00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.990\nSo let's go ahead and\njust take this and move it up.\n\n325\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.000\nIt let me move it up, right?\n\n326\n00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.120\nAnd there's nothing else\nhappening here in between.\n\n327\n00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:51.210\nIf I go back to my Gantt chart, see how\nI've got this huge lead time now, right?\n\n328\n00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.470\nOr, I guess this would be lag time,\nit's afterwards.\n\n329\n00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.142\nSo, now I've got this\nbig gap in the schedule.\n\n330\n00:15:55.142 --> 00:15:59.147\nAnd I saw that looking at myself in\nthe Team Planner, there was this gap, and\n\n331\n00:15:59.147 --> 00:16:03.278\nI could have started moving that, But\nif you've got manually scheduled tasks\n\n332\n00:16:03.278 --> 00:16:06.426\nlike these,\nit doesn't automatically move them around.\n\n333\n00:16:06.426 --> 00:16:09.222\nNow that does change\nif we come in here and\n\n334\n00:16:09.222 --> 00:16:12.710\nchange these guys to like auto scheduled.\n\n335\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:19.954\nSo if I move everybody over to\nauto scheduling, there we go.\n\n336\n00:16:19.954 --> 00:16:22.630\nNow, I'm auto scheduling and\nyou'll see it's already kind of\n\n337\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.165\nbumped those activities up to\nsay let's start them today.\n\n338\n00:16:25.165 --> 00:16:29.530\nCuz that's what auto scheduling likes\nto do, and now if I jump back to my\n\n339\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:33.370\nteam planner, right, things have\nkind of moved around a bit on me.\n\n340\n00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.650\nAnd if I start to take\nsomething like setup PC's and\n\n341\n00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.760\nI decide I wanted to start that next week,\nI can move it forward.\n\n342\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.080\nAnd see what just happened, how set up\nbattery back up's didn't follow it?\n\n343\n00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.880\nThese are set to auto schedule,\nshouldn't it have moved?\n\n344\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.910\nWell, it assumes you\nknow what you're doing.\n\n345\n00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.610\nAnd that if you want the other one\nto move then you'll move it too.\n\n346\n00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:53.230\nRight.\n\n347\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.220\nI didn't do that.\n\n348\n00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.220\nSo if I go back to my task view,\ninto my Gantt chart.\n\n349\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.900\nI can see, even though I'm auto\nscheduling, that lead time or\n\n350\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.650\nlag time here just got reintroduced and\nnow I've got a constraint.\n\n351\n00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.580\nAll right, see my little icon that\nappeared over here on my status column\n\n352\n00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.610\nletting me know that there is a constraint\non this activity, and if I float over it,\n\n353\n00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:16.120\nit's gonna show me that this has\na start no earlier than constraint.\n\n354\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.855\nSo when you start dragging things around,\nif you are auto scheduling,\n\n355\n00:17:19.855 --> 00:17:21.230\nyou're gonna end up with some constraints.\n\n356\n00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.370\nSo you just have to be careful with that,\nall right.\n\n357\n00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:25.331\nLook for it, correct it if you need to.\n\n358\n00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:28.340\nIf your manually scheduling,\nit works great, it's fine.\n\n359\n00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.380\nYou really won't have any\nproblems in manually scheduling.\n\n360\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.470\nAll right,\nanother thing that I wanna talk about.\n\n361\n00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.760\nWe haven't really talked about it in this\nshow yet, is if I've got people that\n\n362\n00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.090\nare over allocated, I mentioned that there\nwere a couple of different solutions and\n\n363\n00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.120\nI really only showed you two.\n\n364\n00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.526\nOption one, was if somebody's doing,\nwell, here, let's kind of repeat it so\n\n365\n00:17:47.526 --> 00:17:48.390\nit all makes sense.\n\n366\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.250\nWe'll tie all of this back together again.\n\n367\n00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:54.050\nSo I'm gonna take some activities here and\n\n368\n00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:55.780\nwe'll just assign Ronnie to everything,\nright.\n\n369\n00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:59.230\nSo I'm gonna take Ronnie and\nI'm gonna assign him every activity.\n\n370\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.750\nNow when I do that,\nRonny's full on over allocated and\n\n371\n00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.470\nI can see that right over here.\n\n372\n00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:10.790\nAnd if I go to my team planner I can\nspot his over allocation right there.\n\n373\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.080\nSo he's over allocated on Friday and\nMonday and\n\n374\n00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.010\nhe's over allocated this following week.\n\n375\n00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.410\nSo he's got some difficult times ahead.\n\n376\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.320\nRonnie's gonna be putting in some OT.\n\n377\n00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.805\nAnd maybe that's fine.\n\n378\n00:18:20.805 --> 00:18:24.095\nSo, I could correct this\nthe way I did earlier, right?\n\n379\n00:18:24.095 --> 00:18:26.745\nOption one, assign some of these\nactivities to somebody else.\n\n380\n00:18:26.745 --> 00:18:28.485\nI could take setup battery backups.\n\n381\n00:18:28.485 --> 00:18:31.765\nI could assign that to me, problem solved.\n\n382\n00:18:31.765 --> 00:18:34.105\nOr I can take it and\nassign it back to Ronnie.\n\n383\n00:18:34.105 --> 00:18:35.315\nAnd now he's over allocated.\n\n384\n00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:37.366\nI'm just going to shift\nthese around a bit, there so\n\n385\n00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.905\nit just looks a little better.\n\n386\n00:18:38.905 --> 00:18:42.840\nAll right, so option one,\nassign it to somebody else.\n\n387\n00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.980\nOption two is make them not\nhappen at the same time, right.\n\n388\n00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.915\nSo, if he's over allocated for\nsetting up these PCs, oh,\n\n389\n00:18:51.915 --> 00:18:54.210\nyou're already over allocated.\n\n390\n00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.450\nI'm trying to over, over allocate you.\n\n391\n00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.490\nSo I can take set up PCs and\nmove them to the next week, right.\n\n392\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.420\nAnd then that problem is solved.\n\n393\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.890\nAnd now he's not oversubscribed anymore,\nso that's another option for me.\n\n394\n00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.670\nBut there's yet another option.\n\n395\n00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:15.535\nThe other option is I could take Ronnie\nand say you're gonna work 50% of your time\n\n396\n00:19:15.535 --> 00:19:20.211\non one activity, and 50% time on the other\nand there just gonna take longer.\n\n397\n00:19:20.211 --> 00:19:22.323\nAll right,\nthat's called resource leveling.\n\n398\n00:19:22.323 --> 00:19:23.876\nResource leveling is where you say,\n\n399\n00:19:23.876 --> 00:19:26.340\nI really need both these things\nto happen at the same time.\n\n400\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.011\nYou just gotta split\nyour time between them.\n\n401\n00:19:28.011 --> 00:19:32.960\nAll right, and we can resource level\nright from within the team planner.\n\n402\n00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.680\nSo the way resource leveling works is\nyou come in and you find your resource.\n\n403\n00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.140\nSo my resource in this case is Ronnie.\n\n404\n00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.930\nAnd when I choose Ronnie I'll have\na button up here that says level resource.\n\n405\n00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.680\nNow there's actually three different\nbuttons, and I wanna talk about\n\n406\n00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.595\neach because the two that are lit up by\ndefault are the two you don't wanna use.\n\n407\n00:19:48.595 --> 00:19:49.105\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n408\n00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:53.850\n[LAUGH] the first one that I\npointed out was level resource.\n\n409\n00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.140\nWhat that's going to do is it's\ngoing to look at Ronnie, and\n\n410\n00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.090\nit's going to look at\nRonnie's whole calendar,\n\n411\n00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:03.880\nhis whole schedule, everything assigned to\nhim all the way to the end of the project.\n\n412\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.970\nAnd it's going to level him\nall the way throughout it.\n\n413\n00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.320\nSo, anywhere he's over allocated, it's\ngoing to make those tasks take longer.\n\n414\n00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.850\nIt's going to stretch them out so\nthat he can do it.\n\n415\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.040\nAll right.\n\n416\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.500\nBut I probably don't want that.\n\n417\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.770\nI probably don't want to do it for\nthe whole thing.\n\n418\n00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.510\nAnd the next button's even worse, right.\n\n419\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.620\nLevel All.\n\n420\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.990\nLevel All says not just Ronnie,\nlets do the whole project.\n\n421\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.280\nWe're gonna level the whole daggone thing.\n\n422\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.150\nAnd that's probably not\nsomething that we want, right.\n\n423\n00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:32.100\nSo most commonly,\nwe're gonna want to Level Selection.\n\n424\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.510\nAnd that's grayed out because,\nwell I don't have a selection, right.\n\n425\n00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.670\nYou gotta come in and pick the jobs.\n\n426\n00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:42.240\nAnd you can just select one, hold control\non your keyboard, and click another one.\n\n427\n00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.560\nNow, I'm just leveling\nthese two activities.\n\n428\n00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.610\nAnd that's normally what we want.\n\n429\n00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.080\nWe want a much more focussed leveling.\n\n430\n00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.420\nSo don't be tempted to go with these other\ntwo buttons cuz they usually have much\n\n431\n00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.980\nbigger affect on your\nproject than what you want.\n\n432\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.530\nIf that's the case,\nwhy are they even there?\n\n433\n00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.500\nWhy do we even have those options?\n\n434\n00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.110\nIn the early stages of your project, when\nyou're just in the very early planning and\n\n435\n00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.040\nyou haven't even figured out\nwhat your finish date is,\n\n436\n00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.390\nthese two buttons are awesome.\n\n437\n00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:08.540\nThey work great.\n\n438\n00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.440\nYou're throwing in your activities,\nyou're kind of laying them out there and\n\n439\n00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.200\nyou wanna do a what if, all right?\n\n440\n00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.160\nWhat if I only have one network engineer,\nhow long is this gonna take?\n\n441\n00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.330\nLet me level them out.\n\n442\n00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:18.470\nRight?\nOoh, that's pretty bad.\n\n443\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.780\nLet me add a second network engineer,\nlet me relevel it, what's it like now?\n\n444\n00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.230\nOh, that's much better, right?\n\n445\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.950\nIt's great for\ndoing scenarios in the early stages.\n\n446\n00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.420\nBut in the later stages of planning, when\nyou've got your baselines in place, you're\n\n447\n00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.930\ntrying to solidify those dates, you don't\nwanna level out through a whole project.\n\n448\n00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:38.970\nThat can really cause some,\nit's not that it causes problems,\n\n449\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.400\nit's that it causes changes that\nwe might not notice right away, so\n\n450\n00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.720\nit's us that causes the problem\nby not noticing, right.\n\n451\n00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.650\nIt creates that opportunity for mistake.\n\n452\n00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:51.060\nSo, instead, in the later stages of\nplanning and through the whole rest of\n\n453\n00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.840\nyour project you'll usually just\nlevel individual activities.\n\n454\n00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.890\nAnd so, I'm going to pick setup network.\n\n455\n00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.400\nAnd I'm gonna hold Ctrl and\npick Setup Battery Backups, and\n\n456\n00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.260\nI'm gonna choose the level\nof the selection.\n\n457\n00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:05.300\nAnd what that's gonna do is it's\ngoing to rearrange things in a way\n\n458\n00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.900\nwhere we don't have the over allocation,\nall right?\n\n459\n00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.370\nAnd in my case instead of\ndropping Ronnie down to 50%,\n\n460\n00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:15.110\nit apparently decided to go ahead and just\ntake it and move setup network back and\n\n461\n00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.410\nput Setup Battery Backups\nright there at the beginning.\n\n462\n00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.930\nNow that may not be what I wanted, right?\n\n463\n00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.300\nI may have wanted him to drop down\nto 50% on each of those activities,\n\n464\n00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.470\nand it didn't do that.\n\n465\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:28.040\nSo I'm gonna undo, and what you'll see\nis up top you've got your level options.\n\n466\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.700\nAnd you can go in there, and\n\n467\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.070\nyou can kind of tweak the way\nthat it's going to be leveling.\n\n468\n00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.760\nAnd you'll see different options in here,\n\n469\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.930\nlike doing automatic leveling\ncalculations, or manual.\n\n470\n00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.670\nWe can look for\nallocations on a day by day basis, or\n\n471\n00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.760\nmonth by month, hour by hour,\nor minute by minute.\n\n472\n00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.370\nYou can tweak a lot of this stuff,\nand we're gonna talk more about\n\n473\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.540\nresource leveling in another\nepisode cuz it isn't important.\n\n474\n00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:55.070\nBut you can tweak that behavior right here\nto tell it what to do, how we want it\n\n475\n00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.540\nto rearrange it, and make sure that it\ndoes drop that to the way that we want.\n\n476\n00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.500\nAnd, we do always have\nthe option to change\n\n477\n00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.010\nexactly how somebody's\nassigned on one of these.\n\n478\n00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.000\nYou can just double click.\n\n479\n00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.030\nLike, I can do this manually if I\ndouble click on that set up network.\n\n480\n00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:12.835\nI could come in here and take resources\nand Ronnie, I can drop his units to 50%.\n\n481\n00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.410\nAnd than I can do the same thing for\nset up battery back up and,\n\n482\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:24.370\nwhen I come in here and\nI change his resources to 50% again,\n\n483\n00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:28.580\nwhat you'll notice is that that was\na two day activity, now it's a four day.\n\n484\n00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.700\nI've effectively manually leveled.\n\n485\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.560\nSo, you don't have to\nuse the auto levelling.\n\n486\n00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.080\nIf you want to do it by hand,\nhere, it's done it, and\n\n487\n00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.360\nI've solved that over\nallocation right there.\n\n488\n00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.220\nI haven't solved this one, right,\nso I still have this problem.\n\n489\n00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:45.115\nI can take setup PCs and\ndrop Ronnie there to 50%.\n\n490\n00:23:45.115 --> 00:23:49.980\nAnd there, now,\nRonnie is no longer over allocated, but\n\n491\n00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.260\nmy stuff takes a lot longer to run.\n\n492\n00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.350\nUsing the resource leveling\nbuttons up here makes it happen\n\n493\n00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.510\na little more automatic so\nyou don't have to go change each one.\n\n494\n00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.270\nBut if you're just doing a handful of\nactivities, you can change it like that.\n\n495\n00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.710\nIt's really the same result.\n\n496\n00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.500\nNow, Ronnie can do all of the work.\n\n497\n00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.430\nThe project is just going to\ntake a little bit longer.\n\n498\n00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.230\nAnd I can see that back\nhere in my Gantt chart,\n\n499\n00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.590\nwhere my project is now a 20 day project,\nas opposed to\n\n500\n00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.226\nthe 10 day that I was originally\nworking with if I had two employees.\n\n501\n00:24:13.226 --> 00:24:17.160\nSo on an effort driven project,\nthat makes a big difference.\n\n502\n00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.330\n>> Yeah, so being able to actually\nlevel these resources and\n\n503\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:23.690\nseeing them is actually kind of a neat\nway that we know that we can go ahead and\n\n504\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:28.380\njust manually move them or if you used\na project stuff you do need to be careful.\n\n505\n00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.270\nBe careful on those leveling\noptions when you go to automatic,\n\n506\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.670\nbecause if you just accidentally check it,\nit's gonna try and level everything.\n\n507\n00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.750\nBut the good thing is there's also another\noption that says clear all levels, so\n\n508\n00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.910\nyou can revert it back to the times\nyou actually had before that.\n\n509\n00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.800\nAnd I know I've done that before where\nI said, I didn't want to level it and\n\n510\n00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.140\nit leveled it anyways, good thing\nI had that option available to me.\n\n511\n00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.360\n>> All right well Ronnie,\nthat's about it on the team planner.\n\n512\n00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.940\nYou guys see how useful it is and\n\n513\n00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.170\nyou kinda understand why I don't\nreally use the other views anymore.\n\n514\n00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:00.300\nThe team planner just shows me everything\nI want in really one concise place.\n\n515\n00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.950\nIt really works out great,\nso mess around with it.\n\n516\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:03.720\nExplore with it.\n\n517\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.610\nI think you'll have fun.\n\n518\n00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.412\nIt is a neat product or\na neat part of Microsoft Project.\n\n519\n00:25:07.412 --> 00:25:10.940\n>> All right, well that's a pretty good\nspot for us to wrap this episode up.\n\n520\n00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.230\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n521\n00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.730\nSigning out for ITProTV I'm Don Pezet.\n\n522\n00:25:13.730 -->

Knowing how to enter cost to a plan is essential to that. They show how to center cost and have it show up for a baseline cost model.",

00:00:15.570\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.450\nI'm your host Don Pizet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.350\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.510\n>> It is going great.\n\n7\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.240\nIt's another great day to\nbe here in the studio to\n\n8\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.120\ntake a look at some Microsoft projects.\n\n9\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.270\nExcited and ready to get started.\n\n10\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.230\n>> Yeah and now in today's episode we're\ngonna take a look at cost modeling.\n\n11\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.560\nAnd if that doesn't sound exciting,\n\n12\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.790\nyou're not gonna hurt my\nfeelings when you say that.\n\n13\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.520\nYou know managing costs for\na project is really important.\n\n14\n00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.010\nI know I said it in an earlier episode.\n\n15\n00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.305\nEvery project has the triple constraints.\n\n16\n00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:42.500\nRight?\nThe triangle.\n\n17\n00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.652\nWhere we have our cost or budget,\nour schedule or time, and\n\n18\n00:00:46.652 --> 00:00:49.655\nthen we have our quality or requirements.\n\n19\n00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:51.235\nDifferent people have different names for\nthese things.\n\n20\n00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:56.240\nSo you'll hear quality, requirements or\nscope, all really mean the same thing.\n\n21\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.790\nSo, when we talk about cost, in earlier\nversions of project, Microsoft just said,\n\n22\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.020\nyou can use other software for\nthat and didn't worry about it.\n\n23\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.590\nBut a couple of versions\nago Microsoft said well,\n\n24\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.240\nwe at least need to have a basic idea\nof our cost about the project, so\n\n25\n00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.050\nwe can create reports and\nhave a better understanding.\n\n26\n00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.270\nAnd so they started adding support for\nthings like Planned Value Analysis or\n\n27\n00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.040\nEarned Value Analysis,\nall that good stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.900\nAnd so you'll see things of that nature.\n\n29\n00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.570\nBut just general cost and budgeting.\n\n30\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.980\nAnd so we wanna take a quick look\nat that and see what we can do.\n\n31\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.340\nNow don't expect this amazing\naccounting suite and billing and\n\n32\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.140\ninvoicing outside of our project,\nit's not gonna happen.\n\n33\n00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.020\nYou still need third-party software for\nthat.\n\n34\n00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.680\nBut if you're just trying to make sure\nyour project's not going over budget,\n\n35\n00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.590\nor to see if you're coming in\nunder budget, Project can do that.\n\n36\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.210\nIt just takes using it.\n\n37\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.990\nIt takes putting in a little extra\ndata and getting that stuff in there.\n\n38\n00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.300\nSo, Ronnie, you're gonna give\nus the guided tour, right?\n\n39\n00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.170\n>> We are.\nWe're gonna take\n\n40\n00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.790\na look at where costs do normally start\nto accrue inside of our project plan.\n\n41\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.380\nAnd make sure that we can\nactually account for them.\n\n42\n00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.910\nAnd where it begins is\nhow much information that\n\n43\n00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.160\nyou have on-hand to be able to\nenter in the project itself.\n\n44\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.370\nAnd we're gonna see some of the different\nways that you can actually enter in some\n\n45\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.820\nof the different resources as well.\n\n46\n00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.995\nAnd then show you were they actually\napply and then show you over all,\n\n47\n00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:13.820\nwhere does that model actually fit in.\n\n48\n00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.920\nSo, lets go ahead take a look\nat my project plan here.\n\n49\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.850\nLet me show you just a few\nthinks as we get started.\n\n50\n00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.080\nSo, lets say that this project plan\nup in this point I've went ahead, and\n\n51\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.110\nit's completed up until the point where\nI'm just about ready to get started.\n\n52\n00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.660\nAnd so I went ahead and\neverything is actually there.\n\n53\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.960\nI have Resources, I have Predecessors,\nI have Finish Dates, Start Dates.\n\n54\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.320\nAnd it's telling me it's gonna\ntake about 30 days to do this.\n\n55\n00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.090\nOverall about 562 hours of work.\n\n56\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.030\nBut remember that I have\ndifferent people working at\n\n57\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.570\ndifferent rates in terms of hourly cost\nthat are actually in this project.\n\n58\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.290\nSo how do I know what that\noverall figure is going to be?\n\n59\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.810\nWell the more information that you can\nprovide here for Project to work with,\n\n60\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.310\nthe more that you're gonna actually\nget even more information out of this.\n\n61\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.210\nAnd it's gonna help you out,\n\n62\n00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.350\nespecially when you're starting\nto do that baseline cost as well.\n\n63\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.000\nSo let's go back and review just a couple\nof things that we've also seen from\n\n64\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.290\nearlier episodes, but is actually good\nto make the point even now as well.\n\n65\n00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.300\nWhich is to take a look at\nour resource sheet, and\n\n66\n00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.720\nactually entering in\nthose resources again.\n\n67\n00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.050\nSo from my standard view\nthat I have right here.\n\n68\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.960\nI'm in the default view.\n\n69\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.030\nI'm going to click on View and\nselect Resource Sheet.\n\n70\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.040\nAnd when I do that, I automatically start\nto see some of the resources that I have\n\n71\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.060\navailable to me and\nwhat has already happened.\n\n72\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.220\nAnd you start seeing\nthese over allocations.\n\n73\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.490\nAnd that is because they're actually over\nscheduled here inside of my project.\n\n74\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.490\nBut notice that each one of these\nresources has a lot of information also\n\n75\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.060\nattached to it, and so\n\n76\n00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.720\nwhat we want to do is we want to put\nas much information in here as we can.\n\n77\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.990\nSo when we take a look at entering in\na resource, if you don't remember, what\n\n78\n00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.490\nyou're gonna do is actually select the\nline, let's say down here under number 13.\n\n79\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.910\nAnd then add in another resource, and\nI'm just gonna call this one Resource 1.\n\n80\n00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.400\nAnd that is kind of at least the most\nbasic information and generic information.\n\n81\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.830\nNow, if I had names that\nwe wanted to add in,\n\n82\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.070\nhopefully at this point in\nmy project I went ahead and\n\n83\n00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.050\nactually switched those names over, but\nI just left some generic names instead.\n\n84\n00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.660\nBut you wanna select the type of\nresource that you also have available\n\n85\n00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.820\nto you as well.\n\n86\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.620\nSo on Resource 1, I can make it a work\nresource, a material resource, or\n\n87\n00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.780\na cost resource as well.\n\n88\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.898\nMost of the time a person resource,\none that works by the hour,\n\n89\n00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:34.788\nis gonna be considered\na work resource too.\n\n90\n00:04:34.788 --> 00:04:38.847\nAnd that means you're gonna pay them\nan hourly wage or a yearly salary or\n\n91\n00:04:38.847 --> 00:04:39.938\nsome type of wage.\n\n92\n00:04:39.938 --> 00:04:42.899\nYou're gonna pay them and\nit's actually gonna be recurring over and\n\n93\n00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:44.880\nover again during your project.\n\n94\n00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.430\nMaterial resources are consumables\nthat we'll use in the making of our\n\n95\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.325\nproject a lot of times, so you can take\na look up here on lines six and seven.\n\n96\n00:04:54.325 --> 00:04:58.330\nOr actually put in some plenum cables\nsince we were also running some lines,\n\n97\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.240\nnot only in our ceiling, but\nalso of course drop cables for\n\n98\n00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.360\neach of the drops that we also have\nin place for our thin clients.\n\n99\n00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.409\nSo you can see that, and\nnotice the term material, and\n\n100\n00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.387\nwe're gonna actually use those\nmaterials up at some point as well, and\n\n101\n00:05:13.387 --> 00:05:16.787\nthen there's also a cost resource\nthat we may also have too.\n\n102\n00:05:16.787 --> 00:05:21.526\nNow if we select a cost resource, this is\nthe one that's actually the trickiest of\n\n103\n00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:24.426\nthem all in what\nthe information's you can have.\n\n104\n00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:29.452\nNotice that with a work resource I\ncan reassign in max units how long\n\n105\n00:05:29.452 --> 00:05:35.060\nthat particular unit can work per day\non that task that we have in hand.\n\n106\n00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.520\nIt's standard rate,\nit's overtime, and whether or\n\n107\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.260\nnot we actually have a cost per use if we\ndid that, and of course the accrual rate.\n\n108\n00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.920\nBut then if I select Material,\nyou'll notice it only says,\n\n109\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.470\nhey, how much is this thing gonna cost?\n\n110\n00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.560\nAnd I'm going to actually use it again.\n\n111\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.110\nCost per use of that.\n\n112\n00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.838\nBut then if I go down to Cost,\n\n113\n00:05:52.838 --> 00:05:56.239\nI can't actually enter any\nof this other information.\n\n114\n00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:59.684\nIf I try and do the standard rate for\nthe cost of something, I can't do that.\n\n115\n00:05:59.684 --> 00:06:03.380\nSo you see my Dell servers\nthat we also put in here.\n\n116\n00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.970\nThere's no resource I can enter in here.\n\n117\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.850\nAnd that's going to be important, because\nwe actually have to enter that information\n\n118\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.400\nsomewhere else when we're\nactually ready to that.\n\n119\n00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.020\nThat's when it's going\nto actually account.\n\n120\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.850\nIf not, you're not going to account for\nthe cost that the overall\n\n121\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.290\nproject is going to have on hand to\nbe able to do some of those things.\n\n122\n00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.170\nAnd we'll enter in those\na little bit later.\n\n123\n00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.810\nSo it's right here that you\nwant to make sure that you can\n\n124\n00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.080\nenter in as much information as you can.\n\n125\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.935\nRemember that if you've come\nto this field and you say,\n\n126\n00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:32.520\nhey, it's a material resource and\nyou decide you're going to try and\n\n127\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.160\nattach it to a calendar,\nit's also not going to work for you too.\n\n128\n00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.580\nUsually for most of us,\n\n129\n00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.440\nespecially we actually are having\npeople work on our project.\n\n130\n00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.850\nWe're going to instead\nselect the work resource.\n\n131\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.260\nAnd then we will fill it out right\nhere as much information as we can.\n\n132\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.100\nSo from here, lets say I'm\ngoing to work on this project.\n\n133\n00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.120\nAnd we can actually enter in my\ninitials and I can actually work up\n\n134\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.290\nto an eight hour day based on this\nterminal server project calendar.\n\n135\n00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.980\nAnd lets say that I work at $10 an hour.\n\n136\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.531\nAnd my overtime, depending on where I am,\nlet's see it's going to be $15 an hour.\n\n137\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.010\nSo, I can select that and there it is.\n\n138\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.510\nThere's my first way that\nI can enter in a resource.\n\n139\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.880\nAnd now,\nif I use that resource in my project,\n\n140\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.420\nit will start accounting for that right\naway to be able to do something like that.\n\n141\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.730\nSo, being able to enter and\nassign the resources is what our goal is.\n\n142\n00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.690\nSo now that I have these resources,\n\n143\n00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:33.490\nthere's multiple ways we can assign\na resource now to our project as well.\n\n144\n00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.930\nSo I can select Resource 1\ndirectly from the resource sheet,\n\n145\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.360\nand I just double click on him.\n\n146\n00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.250\nAnd I go to Cost here.\n\n147\n00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.062\nThere's actually a couple of different\nthings that we can see right here as well,\n\n148\n00:07:46.062 --> 00:07:47.676\nand some of the other details too.\n\n149\n00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.934\nSo I actually skipped over a group.\n\n150\n00:07:49.934 --> 00:07:52.791\nIf I actually had a group\nof people working,\n\n151\n00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:57.748\nremember that I may also associate them\nwith the development team instead.\n\n152\n00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:00.232\nAnd then I can actually\ngroup them together and so\n\n153\n00:08:00.232 --> 00:08:03.031\nI can actually print reports\nbased off of them as well.\n\n154\n00:08:03.031 --> 00:08:05.357\nNow I didn't wanna go\nto that resource team.\n\n155\n00:08:05.357 --> 00:08:08.237\nI wanted to actually see\nwhere I could assign them\n\n156\n00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:10.650\nto an actual task at this point.\n\n157\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.780\nI'm gonna simply click back on task and\ngo back to my gant view.\n\n158\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.080\nAnd this is where we can actually\nassign resources as well.\n\n159\n00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.230\nWe can select a particular\ntask if we want to.\n\n160\n00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.704\nI'm just gonna select one of these\ndown here that's actually not over\n\n161\n00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:24.730\nallocated for right now.\n\n162\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.970\nLet's scroll over here, and then under\nresource name, I have this drop down.\n\n163\n00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.390\nSo as you select these different ones,\n\n164\n00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.390\nthat will now add in a cost associated\nwith using that resource, for\n\n165\n00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.320\nthat task, for the duration of work\nthat's also setup right here as well.\n\n166\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.910\nSo all that actually starts\nto add up in the background\n\n167\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.330\ninside of Microsoft Project if we were\nactually going to do something like that.\n\n168\n00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.690\nAnd they will account\na little bit differently.\n\n169\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.599\nLet me scroll down a little bit here.\n\n170\n00:08:54.599 --> 00:08:58.325\nSo that will actually account for\nthe hourly rate, but\n\n171\n00:08:58.325 --> 00:09:03.428\ndown here under my deploying phase,\nI have the installing and configuring\n\n172\n00:09:03.428 --> 00:09:08.782\nthe 2008 servers, and I'm gonna scroll\nover here to the right hand side.\n\n173\n00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:12.110\nAnd you actually see that I\nhave both of those machines.\n\n174\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.030\nWe're gonna cluster them together to\ngive us better load balancing and\n\n175\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.310\nbetter performance.\n\n176\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.030\nAnd then I have a couple of other\ntechnicians working on those too.\n\n177\n00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.440\nWell, remember I did not have\na cost associated with them\n\n178\n00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.660\ninside of my resource sheet.\n\n179\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:32.870\nSo, if I right click on that task, and I\ngo to information, and under information,\n\n180\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:39.180\nif I now select resources, you'll see,\nlook at what it already started to do.\n\n181\n00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.920\nFor this technician because we actually\nhave three days and I just assigned some\n\n182\n00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.900\nrandom salary and information,\nit's already telling me that for\n\n183\n00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.740\nthis particular task so far,\nthe infrastructure technician as well as\n\n184\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.940\nthe server admin technician, well,\nthey're gonna cost about the same rate.\n\n185\n00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.480\nAnd so at this point,\nlet's talk about $1650 or so.\n\n186\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.370\nIs what it's gonna cost, but\n\n187\n00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.170\nnotice the two servers that I have\nright here that I've not yet set up.\n\n188\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.280\nWell, the only thing that actually gives\nme the ability to do right here is to set\n\n189\n00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.780\nthe cost of those things up and I don't\nactually remember how much they were, so\n\n190\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.810\nI'm just going to say $2,500.\n\n191\n00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.280\nThat's probably low end, I would assume,\nbut I don't really know for\n\n192\n00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.490\nsure, and\nthat's where you can assign those costs.\n\n193\n00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.860\nThey don't appear in that resource table.\n\n194\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.260\nWhen you actually first use them,\nthat's where you can assign the cost for\n\n195\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.360\nthose cost resources.\n\n196\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.320\nSo they don't just show up\nas just a resource per cost.\n\n197\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.010\nYou're gonna actually have to put them in\nmanually if you are gonna use that cost\n\n198\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:37.850\nbased resource.\n\n199\n00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.130\nIt doesn't affect the schedule, so\n\n200\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.610\nit's not gonna actually do anything to\nadjust your schedule if you do that.\n\n201\n00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.267\nBut what you're now doing\nis you're accounting for\n\n202\n00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:50.682\nthe cost of that being\nused inside your project.\n\n203\n00:10:50.682 --> 00:10:52.070\nAnd so we can also do that.\n\n204\n00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.303\nSo, being able to assign work resource and\nmaterial resources\n\n205\n00:10:55.303 --> 00:10:59.550\nto be able to be used inside your project,\nyou want to be able to understand.\n\n206\n00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.791\nThat's a big part of what we have, right?\n\n207\n00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:06.403\nBecause all that information is gonna\ncome down to us getting access to some\n\n208\n00:11:06.403 --> 00:11:09.490\ninformation that's running\nin the background.\n\n209\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.480\nIn other words, all that cost is actually\ngoing to generate a nice little report and\n\n210\n00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.740\na view for us that we actually need.\n\n211\n00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.750\nSo let me show you where\nthat normally shows up.\n\n212\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.040\nWe're not gonna go into reports yet\n\n213\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.230\nbecause we actually have\na whole episode on reports.\n\n214\n00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.250\nBut if I go to project and\n\n215\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.300\nI select project information,\nnow that I think that everything is\n\n216\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.000\nready I can come down here to lower\nleft hand corner and select statistics.\n\n217\n00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.002\nAnd then under the project statistics,\n\n218\n00:11:36.002 --> 00:11:39.749\nthis is where we start seeing\nthat basic cost model come in.\n\n219\n00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:44.384\nSo you can see, at this point, this\nparticular one when I started out was at\n\n220\n00:11:44.384 --> 00:11:48.871\nthe base line, when I ended up taking\nthe base line a little bit earlier at\n\n221\n00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:52.204\nthe beginning,\nbefore I added in those two servers.\n\n222\n00:11:52.204 --> 00:11:58.167\nNotice it was $16,770.08,\nBy adding in that additional $5,000 for\n\n223\n00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:02.820\nthose two servers, notice that\nthat's what ended up happening.\n\n224\n00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.150\nSo you can actually see that adjustment\ngoing on as you start doing that.\n\n225\n00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.468\nLater on when we start\nactually tracking it,\n\n226\n00:12:09.468 --> 00:12:13.921\nwe'll actually start seeing this remaining\namount of money as well and this work, and\n\n227\n00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:18.069\nhow much is actually left as we start\nactually entering in that information too.\n\n228\n00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:21.649\nSo it's a basic breakdown of\njust being able to see this.\n\n229\n00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:27.489\nAnd that way you know if they assigned you\na $20,000 budget, Don, I'm over by 2,000.\n\n230\n00:12:27.489 --> 00:12:29.489\nHopefully that's okay for you.\n\n231\n00:12:29.489 --> 00:12:31.326\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, yeah it is no big deal,\n\n232\n00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:32.830\nwe can just take it\nright out of your check.\n\n233\n00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.199\n>> Oh yeah, that's, you might as well.\n\n234\n00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:39.220\nSo, some actually working every\nsingle task here, but, sure, yeah.\n\n235\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.319\nThat way you can know and if Don says no,\nwell, then you can go back and\n\n236\n00:12:43.319 --> 00:12:47.849\nre-adjust because a project hasn't\nstarted yet, you can now come back and\n\n237\n00:12:47.849 --> 00:12:50.081\nhave at least, some basic figures.\n\n238\n00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:52.610\nAnd Don doesn't come, well,\nhow much are you at right now?\n\n239\n00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.411\nAnd I don't have to go,\nwell, I don't know, Don,\n\n240\n00:12:55.411 --> 00:12:57.718\nI'm really at a struggle to even tell you.\n\n241\n00:12:57.718 --> 00:13:00.132\nWell, if you're actually\nentering in all that information,\n\n242\n00:13:00.132 --> 00:13:02.418\nthe project's tracking it for\nyou, which is really nice.\n\n243\n00:13:02.418 --> 00:13:03.839\n>> Yeah, and we see this more,\n\n244\n00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:08.140\nwe'll have some episodes later on on\nthe reporting services inside a project.\n\n245\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.870\nAnd you can generate reports\nwhich are pretty handy that show\n\n246\n00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.950\nwhen those expenses were incurred right,\nbecause I might need to know,\n\n247\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.220\nover the last three months, I went over\nbudget, where did that happen exactly?\n\n248\n00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.230\nYou kind of lay it out on a chart\nagainst your baseline and see and\n\n249\n00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.320\nwe'll cover that in the reporting section.\n\n250\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.820\nKey things to remember here that this is\nnot something you'd want to submit to\n\n251\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.860\nthe IRS or to a tax agency or\naccounting audit or whatever.\n\n252\n00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.370\nThese are just numbers that are here for\n\n253\n00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.660\nyou to track your budget, you may have\nmany expenses that aren't reflected here.\n\n254\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.190\nThings like employee benefits and\nso on that's tracked by HR and\n\n255\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.020\nthe accounting departments\nin your organization,\n\n256\n00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:49.150\nso this is just in terms of the project,\nand used to give you a meter to be able\n\n257\n00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.100\nto measure against to be able to see,, am\nI going over budget or am I going under?\n\n258\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.636\nAnd, you might be going over budget for\na reason,right, and\n\n259\n00:13:56.636 --> 00:13:58.949\nit may be approved with a change ticket.\n\n260\n00:13:58.949 --> 00:14:02.788\nAnd if it's been an approved thing like,\nhey the cost of servers went up from when\n\n261\n00:14:02.788 --> 00:14:06.516\nwe originally quoted them so they're\ngonna cost more, well, we need to go and\n\n262\n00:14:06.516 --> 00:14:08.330\nupdate our baseline to reflect that.\n\n263\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.300\nAnd we'll see in another\nepisode on baselines too, so\n\n264\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.070\nit is a great way to see that and\nspot it though and notice a red flag, and\n\n265\n00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.950\nhopefully it is something\nwe can notice and fix.\n\n266\n00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.410\nOtherwise our project is\nin trouble because money's\n\n267\n00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.220\ngot to come from somewhere right.\n\n268\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.530\n>> And Don you've mentioned a great point\nright there about sometimes it doesn't\n\n269\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.100\nreflect the reality of the resource\nthat we're using right then and there.\n\n270\n00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.800\nBecause remember that what can happen,\nright, is not only those servers change\n\n271\n00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.980\ncost at times but sometimes people's\nrate can also change as well.\n\n272\n00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.174\nAnd when that happens and you assign them\nto that project right away, right now,\n\n273\n00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:47.492\nlet's take for an example on my project,\nwe have this cubical installation here,\n\n274\n00:14:47.492 --> 00:14:51.070\ninstalling different cubicles,\nand we contracted out let's say,\n\n275\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.700\na cubicle installer to be able to do so.\n\n276\n00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.535\nWell, the rate that I've got them at if\nI go back to my view and other resource\n\n277\n00:14:59.535 --> 00:15:04.780\nsheet, at the cubicle installer, you can\nsee that I've got him at $15 per hour.\n\n278\n00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.182\nWell that might have actually been\nthe number that he quoted right at\n\n279\n00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:11.642\nthe beginning when he told us that\nthis was what it was going to be, but\n\n280\n00:15:11.642 --> 00:15:14.639\nwhat if his rates actually change\nbased on the time of year.\n\n281\n00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:17.803\nIn other words, as he got busier\nduring the years, he said,\n\n282\n00:15:17.803 --> 00:15:22.040\nno if you need me during this time of\nyear, it's actually going to be different.\n\n283\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.250\nIn other words it's gonna be higher\nthan what we expected, so of course,\n\n284\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.070\nwhat am I hoping to do?\n\n285\n00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.610\nI'm hoping to schedule him early enough\nwhere he doesn't, but I need to account\n\n286\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.660\nthat so that I can actually give\na more accurate representation.\n\n287\n00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.760\nAnd I kinda realized that maybe that's\nthe reason why his numbers actually went\n\n288\n00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.220\nup is because we actually did have\nhim at the higher rate time of year.\n\n289\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.440\nWell that can also happen as well,\nlet me show you where to do that.\n\n290\n00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.290\nSo since I have this\nCubicle Installer as a resource\n\n291\n00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:52.150\nalready selected, I'm gonna right\nclick and go to information.\n\n292\n00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:57.528\nAnd bring up his resource\ninformation sheet as well.\n\n293\n00:15:57.528 --> 00:16:02.289\nNow what we're looking for\nis right here under cost, okay.\n\n294\n00:16:02.289 --> 00:16:04.494\nSo I'll just call this what\nthey call the rate table,\n\n295\n00:16:04.494 --> 00:16:06.412\nthat's normally what they call this, here.\n\n296\n00:16:06.412 --> 00:16:11.172\nThis actually gives me the ability to take\nthis one resource, and I can say that.\n\n297\n00:16:11.172 --> 00:16:15.360\nI can say for this period of time,\nhe really is at $15 an hour.\n\n298\n00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.790\nBut let's say it gets closer to,\nI don't know, Christmas or something,\n\n299\n00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.320\nand he says no, I install so\nmany more cubicles.\n\n300\n00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.980\nI'm really gonna charge, let's say\n$20 an hour or whatever it might be.\n\n301\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.210\nWell, I already him I know, for a certain\nperiod of time here, I have him for 15.\n\n302\n00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.730\nBut let's say that I go ahead and\ndo that, I select task B.\n\n303\n00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:41.010\nAnd then I can actually have him, let's\nsay, for $20 an hour at task B, okay.\n\n304\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.710\nNow, I might do something like that and\nthat will actually work.\n\n305\n00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:47.270\nAnd we'll actually see that what we\ncan do is depending on when it is,\n\n306\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:53.070\nwe can actually assign that different rate\nto them, based on that date if we need to.\n\n307\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.040\nBut, it could even be,\nlet's say someone else.\n\n308\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.980\nLet's say we have another contractor\ninstead, Don that says look, if you\n\n309\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:03.360\ncall me during the day no problem, here's\nwhat the cost is, it's a $100 to do that.\n\n310\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.170\nBut Don,\n\n311\n00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.870\nif you call me after 5:00 PM, my rate\nmight jump up to, let's say $150 an hour.\n\n312\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.900\nWell, then you also have to account for\nthat in your project as well.\n\n313\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.720\nAnd that's what the rate table\nhelps us to be able to do, right?\n\n314\n00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:20.100\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and you might also\nfind the rates change over time, too.\n\n315\n00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.870\nYou might hire on an employee at one rate\nand they get a raise later on, right.\n\n316\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:26.250\nAnd now they're at a different rate.\n\n317\n00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.160\nSo these are all things that we've\ngotta track and keep on top of.\n\n318\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.630\nAnd it's really challenging, especially\nfor a project manager where maybe you did\n\n319\n00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.180\ngreat planning, leading up to a project\nstarting and your in the executing phase.\n\n320\n00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.870\nAnd whoever that employee's actual\noperational manager is gives them a raise.\n\n321\n00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.670\nWell, you weren't part of that,\nthey're not your employee,\n\n322\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.210\nthey're just working on the project.\n\n323\n00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.170\nAnd now your budget changes\nthanks to that, right.\n\n324\n00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.050\nThat's all stuff that we need to track and\nproject gives us the way to do that.\n\n325\n00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.160\n>> Now not only can we do\nit just based on this,\n\n326\n00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.220\nwe can do it based on any other resources.\n\n327\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.700\nBut notice also the accrual time too,\nwhen you doing that.\n\n328\n00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.880\nSo you can change that\nif you need to based on,\n\n329\n00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.380\nhow you're actually going to account for\nthat as well.\n\n330\n00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.740\nSo, once I have that set up,\nnow what do we do?\n\n331\n00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.065\nI mean, big deal you've got it set up.\n\n332\n00:18:12.065 --> 00:18:16.635\nIt's only one real task here, but\nif it depends on that time of the year to\n\n333\n00:18:16.635 --> 00:18:19.555\nbe able to actually know\nwhat's gonna happen well,\n\n334\n00:18:19.555 --> 00:18:22.755\nthen all I have to do is go back\nto my Gantt chart over here.\n\n335\n00:18:22.755 --> 00:18:24.425\nI like that the Gantt chart view.\n\n336\n00:18:24.425 --> 00:18:28.095\nIt's the one that I default working in and\nI like the,\n\n337\n00:18:28.095 --> 00:18:33.300\nI select the installing cubicles here and\nI need to bring up another view.\n\n338\n00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.200\nSo I actually need to make sure I know\nthat it's line 20 there or I'll miss it.\n\n339\n00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.760\nAnd what I'm looking for\nis what I call the resource usage view,\n\n340\n00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.280\nis what I'm looking for.\n\n341\n00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.490\nSo if I select under Gantt chart,\nI look for resource usage.\n\n342\n00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:51.690\nAnd this is where we can begin\nto see some of those different\n\n343\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.650\nover allocations that\nwe have if we need to.\n\n344\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.440\nSo let me scroll down a little bit.\n\n345\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.700\nNow, my project isn't really\nstarting until a little bit later.\n\n346\n00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.190\nLet me go ahead and scroll over to\nsome of the different tasks, and\n\n347\n00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.080\nwe'll start seeing some of that stuff.\n\n348\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.790\nBut I'm scrolling down and\nI'm looking for that cubicle installer.\n\n349\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.900\nNow, when I actually select\nthat cubicle installer I\n\n350\n00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.950\ncan see that on a couple of days he's\nactually working eight hours and\n\n351\n00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.220\neight hours there, but\nlet's see that this was his busy time.\n\n352\n00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.820\nBy default it defaults that first tab\nthat's actually there on the cost table\n\n353\n00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.320\nand he says, no, but\nthat's not the way it's gonna be.\n\n354\n00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.765\nI can right-click and go to,\nactually it's on the task itself.\n\n355\n00:19:31.765 --> 00:19:36.040\nRight-click and go to Information.\n\n356\n00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.540\nAnd I am not telling you the truth,\nit's actually not there.\n\n357\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.040\nI actually need to add in the column,\nthat's what I forgot.\n\n358\n00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:48.630\nSo right here under add a new column,\nI need to show up the cost rate table.\n\n359\n00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.750\nAnd when I do that,\nnow you can actually see,\n\n360\n00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.320\nhere is the default rate that\nhe's actually working at.\n\n361\n00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.120\nAnd so now if I actually knew oh,\n\n362\n00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.710\nlook it was right then he\nsaid my rates were going up.\n\n363\n00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:07.250\nThen I can select b or whatever the rate\nmight be, and actually select that.\n\n364\n00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.760\nAnd now I can change this rate table.\n\n365\n00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.450\nNow, you might wonder,\nhow do I keep track of what's the rate and\n\n366\n00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.820\nwhat can I do there?\n\n367\n00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:20.240\nWell, on each of these resources then,\nyou have notes.\n\n368\n00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:28.895\nSo you can say that A rate table is\ngonna have to equal $15 per hour,\n\n369\n00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:33.520\nand then B rate table is gonna equal,\n\n370\n00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.360\nlet's say $20 per oops.\n\n371\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.897\nTyping is-\n>> [LAUGH\n\n372\n00:20:38.897 --> 00:20:42.230\n>> Something I've been doing my whole life\n\n373\n00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.380\nexcept apparently I can't do it.\n\n374\n00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.665\nIs $20 per hour and\nI might even emphasize note.\n\n375\n00:20:46.665 --> 00:20:50.946\nPlease use, if possible,\n\n376\n00:20:50.946 --> 00:20:55.810\n[LAUGH] at lower rate, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.680\nBut you might not be able to, but\n\n378\n00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.240\nat least this way if you're going,\nwhy is his number so different so wrong?\n\n379\n00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.150\nWell, you can go in there, and\n\n380\n00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.180\nnow you have notes that also help\nyou to be able to know that.\n\n381\n00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.520\nSo you don't have to go back\nto that rate table every time.\n\n382\n00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.870\nBut using those notes can\nbe a little bit helpful.\n\n383\n00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.650\nAnd they also show up right here\ninside of the resource usage.\n\n384\n00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.070\nAnd if I hover over,\nyou can barely see it.\n\n385\n00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.430\nBut it actually says right there,\nthe rate table.\n\n386\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.740\nAnd here's the A, here's the B.\n\n387\n00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.720\nAnd it will actually go ahead and\nadjust their schedule for that.\n\n388\n00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.070\nAnd now you can actually\nassign different rates.\n\n389\n00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:31.570\nAnd whether or not it's actually\nsomeone that's doing it on season or\n\n390\n00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.250\nwhether like Don was mentioning.\n\n391\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.220\nThey're gonna get a raise at some\npoint and you need to adjust that for\n\n392\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.090\ntheir schedule, here it is.\n\n393\n00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:42.110\n>> Yeah, that is a great way\nto see it just be careful.\n\n394\n00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.383\nIf you go and\nupdate the actual rate, obviously,\n\n395\n00:21:44.383 --> 00:21:46.510\nit's not gonna automatically update notes.\n\n396\n00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.870\nYou'll need to make sure that you\ndo that as part of your routine.\n\n397\n00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.350\nBut by putting it there in your note,\nyou'll just float your mouse over it and\n\n398\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.280\nsee it.\n\n399\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.050\nThat's also a great way.\n\n400\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.008\nYou can also add in a custom\ncolumns to see those rates, too.\n\n401\n00:21:55.008 --> 00:21:57.115\nSo there are a few different\nways you can go about that.\n\n402\n00:21:57.115 --> 00:22:02.145\nBut this way is really super easy,\nas long as you [INAUDIBLE].\n\n403\n00:22:02.145 --> 00:22:06.045\n>> So Don, I think that for basic\nmodeling, that's what we're really looking\n\n404\n00:22:06.045 --> 00:22:09.075\nfor, is understanding where we're\ngonna enter this information in.\n\n405\n00:22:09.075 --> 00:22:12.435\nAnd then being able to\nsee that overall number,\n\n406\n00:22:12.435 --> 00:22:15.595\nespecially if you're trying\nto target that number,\n\n407\n00:22:15.595 --> 00:22:18.230\nyou're 20,000, now you're 22,000 And\nyou can go back in now and\n\n408\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.230\nstart actually adjusting, since you\ndon't have any work actually going on.\n\n409\n00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.580\nThis may be the best time for\nyou to actually go back and go.\n\n410\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.260\nAll right, I can try and trim here,\nand I can try and adjust here as well.\n\n411\n00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.750\n>> Yeah, absolutely, all right,\n\n412\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.140\nwell Ronnie that's probably a pretty\ngood spot for us to wrap this one up.\n\n413\n00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.500\nNow, I did mention some\nreporting that we have for cost.\n\n414\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.960\nSo we are gonna see cost more in later\nepisodes as we dive into the customer\n\n415\n00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.770\nports we can build inside\nof Microsoft Project.\n\n416\n00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.560\nReally powerful stuff there, definitely\nsomething you'll wanna check out.\n\n417\n00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.560\nBut for now, we'll go ahead and\nwrap this episode up.\n\n418\n00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.550\nSo signing off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n419\n00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.250\n>> I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n420\n00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.602\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n421\n00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:51.102\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.195\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:19.000\nI'm your host Don Pezet back in with Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.710\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.530\n>> It is going great.\n\n7\n00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.390\nIt's another beautiful day\nanother day that we actually get\n\n8\n00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.010\nto spend working with some technology,\nMicrosoft Project.\n\n9\n00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.790\n>> That's right and today we're gonna\nkind of continuing on with resources.\n\n10\n00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.860\n>> I know we filmed some previous\nepisodes where we talked about\n\n11\n00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.880\nresources as people or\nresources as a budget.\n\n12\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.280\nToday we're going to talk about\nresources as in material.\n\n13\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.115\nAs in the junk we need.\n\n14\n00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:45.130\n[LAUGH] Not junk, but\nthe items and equipment and\n\n15\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.590\nother things that we need in order\nto get activities completed.\n\n16\n00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.150\nProject lets us track all that,\nright Ronnie?\n\n17\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.760\n>> It really does.\n\n18\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.869\nMaterial resources are normally gonna be\nresources that we use up while our project\n\n19\n00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:59.155\ncontinues to make progress throughout the\ntime that we're actually on that project,\n\n20\n00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:02.029\nso there's a lot of things taht\nwe still have to account for\n\n21\n00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:04.989\nthat really go into the overall\ncost of the project itself.\n\n22\n00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.079\nAnd so even though we're actually using it\nto help us build the final end of what we\n\n23\n00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.290\nreally want, we still need to account for\nthat because it does actually account for\n\n24\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.440\nthe total cost of the project.\n\n25\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.550\nSo when we start actually getting ready\nto get our project plan setup and ready\n\n26\n00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.890\nto go, we also want to make sure that we\ncan account for things like that as well.\n\n27\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.589\nSo we do have an understanding\nthat we'll set up regular\n\n28\n00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:30.160\nwork resources with\nnormally people that will\n\n29\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.860\nwork on our project to help us\nto accomplish what we need.\n\n30\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.970\nWe know that there's also gonna be\nwhat we call of course some different\n\n31\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.920\ncosts that are there too,\n\n32\n00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.990\nso we might buy some different products\nthat we're gonna use and that.\n\n33\n00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.010\nSo in my example, we've talked about it\nbefore in a project planner we had where\n\n34\n00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.140\nwe purchased YZen clients or\nmaybe a couple of different servers too.\n\n35\n00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.130\nBut in what we're actually going to\ntake a look at and do here today,\n\n36\n00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.592\nis that we want to setup those material\nresources that are going to help us to get\n\n37\n00:01:55.592 --> 00:01:58.630\nsetup the way that we need to for\nmy terminal server project.\n\n38\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.550\nSo let me go ahead and\nkind of show you and\n\n39\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.470\nthen setup what we're talking about here.\n\n40\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.170\nSo on my machine I went ahead and\nbrought up my terminal server project and\n\n41\n00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.410\nwe've gone through, let's say that\nwe're ready to go, we're just about\n\n42\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.740\nready to go and now we're starting to\nenter in some of the different resources.\n\n43\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.120\nAnd we've done that, and\nyou can take a look if you want,\n\n44\n00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.310\nmaybe if I can actually use my\ntask bar here, my scroll bar.\n\n45\n00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.350\nWe've already set up some\ndifferent resources along the way.\n\n46\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.600\nSome work resources that we need, and\nso that way we actually know that we're\n\n47\n00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.100\nstarting to account for\nhow much it's going to cost.\n\n48\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.000\nIf I double click on this task I can\nsee that I've assigned the server ad\n\n49\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.150\nadministration tech here and\nif he's gonna be working on that one task,\n\n50\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.270\nwe believe it's gonna cost somewhere\nabout $807 if he's going to do that.\n\n51\n00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.735\nPerfectly fine, as long as we\ncan account for it we're okay.\n\n52\n00:02:45.735 --> 00:02:48.965\nBut there are some other things that\nwe may actually be doing in our\n\n53\n00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:50.305\nproject plan here.\n\n54\n00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:51.625\nOnce we get all the testing done,\n\n55\n00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:55.515\nduring the deployment phase,\nit's right here in these first three\n\n56\n00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:59.705\ntasks that I have available to us that\nwe want to focus in on right here too.\n\n57\n00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:03.030\nWe know that we're gonna need people\nto work on it, perfectly fine.\n\n58\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.580\nBut in the installing premise cabling and\npatch cabling, even though we're gonna\n\n59\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.810\ncontract this out, they're still\ngonna charge us money for it as well.\n\n60\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.750\nSo we also wanna go ahead and\naccount for that too.\n\n61\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.200\nSo we have, of course, premise cabling for\n\n62\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.590\nthe things that are gonna\nbe inside the walls.\n\n63\n00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.950\nAnd then patch cabling,\nthings outside of the walls.\n\n64\n00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.540\nWhen we run drop cables and of course\ndirectly to the cubicles themselves.\n\n65\n00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.720\nSo if we want to add in\na material resource, well,\n\n66\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.470\nwe do have the resource sheet.\n\n67\n00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.680\nLet me show you what we're talking about.\n\n68\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.320\nIf I go to View and then under\nResource View I select Resource Sheets and\n\n69\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.480\nright here I went ahead and\nadded in my Cat5e plenum cable.\n\n70\n00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.910\nAnd when you see that, notice that\nit's different under the type here.\n\n71\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.330\nInstead of work it's actually\ngoing to be material and\n\n72\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.220\nit's not a cost resource where I paid\none time for it, but this right here and\n\n73\n00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.980\nthen under the material,\nthis is the units that we have marked.\n\n74\n00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.300\nIf you're never sure you can always hover\nover that little column header there.\n\n75\n00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.760\nIt says unit of measurement you enter for\nthe material resource.\n\n76\n00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.550\nSo whether it's actually in tons or\ncubic yards, hopefully not tons of cable.\n\n77\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.140\nI don't want that.\nBut if you have that you can actually\n\n78\n00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.170\nenter that in and then you can enter\nwhat the costs is going to be back.\n\n79\n00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.860\nI want to enter in\nthe measurement here of feet so\n\n80\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.650\nwe actually could break it down by how\nmany feet we're going to actually use.\n\n81\n00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.901\n>> And you know, that's really the element\nthat differentiates this from a cost\n\n82\n00:04:20.901 --> 00:04:22.720\nbecause you might say,\nwell I had to buy the cable.\n\n83\n00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.920\nIt's a cost, right?\n\n84\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.910\nWell the difference here is that when\nyou buy something that's a cost,\n\n85\n00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.160\nwell that's a one time cost.\n\n86\n00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.180\nYou're buying one item for one price.\n\n87\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.390\nBut with that cable, if I get a five foot\ncable or a ten foot cable, it's one cable.\n\n88\n00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.660\nIt's still one item.\n\n89\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.460\nBut that length is what determines\nhow much it's gonna be.\n\n90\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.870\nSo this could be weight.\n\n91\n00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.060\nIt could be volume.\n\n92\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.480\nIt could be all sorts of units of measure.\n\n93\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.160\nIt's whatever you like.\n\n94\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.330\nIt could be something you made up, right?\n\n95\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.031\nSo it's one dracknar\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:50.190\n>> [LAUGH] And that's what\n\n97\n00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.750\nyou put in there.\n\n98\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.120\nIt's whatever you use.\n\n99\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.670\nSo in this case it's v 8 years,\nit might be meters or whatever, and\n\n100\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.470\nnow you might use that same material\nover and over and over again.\n\n101\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.330\nOn one activity,\nI might have a hundred foot of cabling,\n\n102\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.880\non another activity I might have\na thousand foot of cabling.\n\n103\n00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.640\nIt's not the same resource,\n\n104\n00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.000\nI mean it's the same resource\nhere on the resource sheet, but\n\n105\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.910\nwe're using different amounts of it each\ntime and that costs starts to add up.\n\n106\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.440\nVersus a cost item like the thin\nclient that Ronnie has down there.\n\n107\n00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.630\nIf we're talking about that one item,\nit is indeed one item and\n\n108\n00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.640\nif I assign that to\nmore than one activity,\n\n109\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.870\nI'm basically saying I'm going to buy\nmore than one of this particular item.\n\n110\n00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.910\nSo a little difference.\n\n111\n00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.460\nRight and so when you do end up putting\nthat material unit of measure in there,\n\n112\n00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.370\nthen you come over here to standard\nrate and that's how you break it down.\n\n113\n00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.640\nI just went and did a Google search for\n1000 feet of cable and I took the amount\n\n114\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.975\nit was, which was like $110 and I just\ndivided that up into different feet and\n\n115\n00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:46.583\nthat gave me about 11 cents per feet for\na regular plumbing cabl.\n\n116\n00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:49.068\nAnd then when I went to the drop\ncable it was like 8.2 and so\n\n117\n00:05:49.068 --> 00:05:51.250\nI rounded down and just made 8 cents here.\n\n118\n00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.180\n>> You've got to be careful with\nthat number because a lot of\n\n119\n00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.220\ncompanies will give you a discount\nwhen you buy in bulk, right?\n\n120\n00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.940\nSo Ronnie, you said you did 1000 feet and\nso it was 11 cents a foot, right?\n\n121\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.280\nWell, what if we have an activity\nthat only calls for 100 feet?\n\n122\n00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.200\nWell, maybe that 11 cents was\na discounted value and so\n\n123\n00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.640\nnow you're going to get this disparity.\n\n124\n00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.590\nWell, in those scenarios\nyou've got a choice.\n\n125\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.270\nEither one,\nyou can quote the highest price.\n\n126\n00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.710\nWhat if I just bought 1 foot of cabling\nand then any time we bought in bulk it was\n\n127\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.570\na discount and\nit was money off of our budget.\n\n128\n00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.890\nThat's a safety net right there, and\nit creates padding in your project.\n\n129\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.480\nSome projects don't like that.\n\n130\n00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.450\nSo if that's the case,\nif you can't do padding,\n\n131\n00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.420\nyou're going to have to create\nmore than one material resource.\n\n132\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.916\nYou'd have to create one that\nwas cabling less than 500 feet.\n\n133\n00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:39.191\nAnother one that was\ncabling 500 to 1000 feet.\n\n134\n00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:41.513\nAnother one that was cabling\n1000 to 10,000 feet.\n\n135\n00:06:41.513 --> 00:06:44.282\nAnd listed the different pricing\nthere to be able to identify those\n\n136\n00:06:44.282 --> 00:06:47.400\ndown to separate resources,\nit starts to get a little complex.\n\n137\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.120\n>> It really can get complex\nespecially when you have those multiple\n\n138\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.280\nunits that you're working with.\n\n139\n00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.950\nBut the good thing is, for us, we now need\n\n140\n00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.140\nto take what we have here on our resource\nsheet, and then assign them to the task.\n\n141\n00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.020\nAnd that's what's going to generate the\noverall cost that we're going to actually\n\n142\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.900\nhave inside of our project.\n\n143\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.700\nSo for us to do that, I'm simply\ngoing to go back to my task view.\n\n144\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.320\nAnd select the gan chart there.\n\n145\n00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.740\nAnd then if I go down here to 3.1 where it\ntalks about installing premise tabling,\n\n146\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.610\nI can now assign another resource.\n\n147\n00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.940\nNow there's multiple ways to do this,\nof course, but\n\n148\n00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.180\nI'm just gonna right click and\ngo down to the information box, and\n\n149\n00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.290\nthat should bring up\nthe task information dialog.\n\n150\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.980\nA box for me, I'm gonna select\nthe third tab that says Resources.\n\n151\n00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.250\nAnd right here you can see that currently\nI have three separate resources helping\n\n152\n00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.280\nto do the installing,\nthe premise cabling at this point.\n\n153\n00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.470\nBut remember that we also need to account\nfor those things like the cabling.\n\n154\n00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.830\nSo the good thing is,\nif you do have your resource sheet,\n\n155\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.210\nit should also show up here on all\nthe different ones that we can select.\n\n156\n00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.100\nSo since I'm actually running\nthis inside of the premise of\n\n157\n00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.500\nthe walls and the ceilings.\n\n158\n00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.126\nI'm gonna select that Cat5e plenum.\n\n159\n00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:59.635\nAnd notice by default it assigns it as\na single unit of 1 feet because that's\n\n160\n00:07:59.635 --> 00:08:02.459\nactually what I put inside\nthe resource sheet.\n\n161\n00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:07.315\nSo at this point let's say I'm gonna run\n35 or I'll say 40 different cubicles and\n\n162\n00:08:07.315 --> 00:08:10.080\nthen I know that their\nprobably gonna run about,\n\n163\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.040\nlet's say about 50 feet per run, right.\n\n164\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.840\nSo I might actually end up needing, and\nI don't even know what that's gonna be,\n\n165\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.250\n50 x 40?\n\n166\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.769\nIs that 2000?\n\n167\n00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:20.540\n[LAUGH] I don't have a clue.\n\n168\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.390\nLet's say I'm gonna do 2,000 feet,\nnotice it accepts it.\n\n169\n00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.610\nNow, here, by default,\n\n170\n00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.190\ninside of project, it actually will\ndo it by a half feet length as well.\n\n171\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.700\nSo, if you're really keeping track\nall the way down to the half,\n\n172\n00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.568\nbut you can even do that at least for\nwhat we have here.\n\n173\n00:08:36.568 --> 00:08:38.920\nI'm just gonna round off to 2,000 feet, so\n\n174\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.850\nI know I'm gonna have that many\ndifferent runs and jobs and stuff now.\n\n175\n00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.760\nI go and do that, it doesn't look\nlike it calculated anything Don,\n\n176\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.420\nit looks like it's just sitting there.\n\n177\n00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.340\nThat's because project hasn't yet\ngone through and\n\n178\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.900\nsaid, here's some new information.\n\n179\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.090\nNow, let me go ahead and\ncalculate the value to this here.\n\n180\n00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.180\nSo I have to click okay.\n\n181\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.870\nI know it's kinda strange but\nthat's the only way to see it.\n\n182\n00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.290\nAnd then I can right click and\ngo back to the information dialog box.\n\n183\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.290\nAnd from here go ahead and\nselect resources.\n\n184\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.740\nAnd now you can see at this point,\nit went ahead and\n\n185\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.500\ntook my $0.11 per foot at that point and\ncranked it out to $220.\n\n186\n00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.510\nFor just this one task, if I'm actually\ngonna be doing something like that.\n\n187\n00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.612\nI now at least have something I\ncan begin to model my cost off of.\n\n188\n00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:25.207\nSo if I know that I'm actually\ngonna have to buy that,\n\n189\n00:09:25.207 --> 00:09:29.027\nI buy a couple of boxes of [INAUDIBLE]\nif that's what's gonna end up happening.\n\n190\n00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:33.000\nAnd I'll know at least what the cost is\ngonna be as we continue to move forward.\n\n191\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.540\n>> And the neat part is you\ncan use this material over and\n\n192\n00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.170\nover again in other tasks.\n\n193\n00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.980\nAnd it's not like a person.\n\n194\n00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.760\nWhen you have a work resource, a person,\n\n195\n00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.590\nif I assign that person to two tasks at\nthe same time, they're over allocated.\n\n196\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.150\nI get my little red figure that appears\nto let me know the person is doing too\n\n197\n00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.120\nmuch work.\n\n198\n00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.180\nBut when it's the material,\nI might be buying 2,000 feet of cable for\n\n199\n00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.445\n2,000 feet, I must be going crazy.\n\n200\n00:09:55.445 --> 00:09:56.670\n>> 2,000 foot.\n\n201\n00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.425\n>> 2,000, whatever,\nwe'll switch to metric here.\n\n202\n00:09:58.425 --> 00:10:01.095\n>> Meters.\n>> So we're buying 2,000 meters of cable\n\n203\n00:10:01.095 --> 00:10:03.735\nfor one activity, and\nanother 2,000 meters of cable for\n\n204\n00:10:03.735 --> 00:10:04.975\na second activity at a same time.\n\n205\n00:10:04.975 --> 00:10:08.155\nAnd project looks at it and\nsays, well it's a material.\n\n206\n00:10:08.155 --> 00:10:10.555\nIt's not over allocated,\nwe're just buying more of it.\n\n207\n00:10:10.555 --> 00:10:13.055\nSo if I have 2,000 on one activity and\n2,000 on the other activity,\n\n208\n00:10:13.055 --> 00:10:14.840\nI now have 4,000 total.\n\n209\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.140\nIt doesn't happen with a resource.\n\n210\n00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.750\nIf I assign Ronnie to one activity and\nRonnie to a second activity,\n\n211\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.050\nit doesn't say, Ronnie's a material,\nwe'll have two Ronnies.\n\n212\n00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.700\nIt knows that there's only one\nof those versus the material,\n\n213\n00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.060\nwhere there can be many, many of them.\n\n214\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.830\n>> And sometimes, remember, you will\nhave certain materials that will be\n\n215\n00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.880\nfairly similar, but they will have\ndifferent costs adjusted to them.\n\n216\n00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.690\nAnd that's what I also had as\nan example of the premise tabling,\n\n217\n00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.920\nwhere the plenum cable versus\nthe regular PVC cabling as well.\n\n218\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.900\nAnd so, the next task that I\nhave also set up here is for.\n\n219\n00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.750\nWell, let's say installing\nthe patch panel itself.\n\n220\n00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.170\nAnd for connecting to the switch and\n\n221\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.430\nrunning drop cables, and all those\ndifferent things that we have there.\n\n222\n00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.690\nAnd when we start talking about it,\n\n223\n00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.740\nthey'll notice there's\nnetwork premise wiring.\n\n224\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.480\nYou can continue to add those in, and\nthat's what Don was talking about.\n\n225\n00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.400\nYou add them in, and at the end of that,\ncost of everything that you have.\n\n226\n00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.670\nWell, now Don says well Ronnie,\nhow much cabling are we buying?\n\n227\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.210\nWell, later on we're gonna see in reports\nthat I can go ahead and create a filter.\n\n228\n00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.870\nI say I want all my material resources,\nadd them up right here.\n\n229\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.020\nAnd I go Don,\n\n230\n00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.310\nit's gonna cost us a pretty good chunk\nof change in just buying cabling.\n\n231\n00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.530\nOh, and I also forgot those connectors,\nand you start doing that.\n\n232\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.935\nDon, I said, just go ahead and order\nall that fully done or, probably not.\n\n233\n00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But at this point, let's go ahead and\n\n234\n00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.980\ndo that and get it done.\n\n235\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.730\nSo that's what we're trying to do\non the modelling of those costs for\n\n236\n00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.960\nthings like that.\n\n237\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.330\nSometimes we do have those\nfixed costs as well, right Don?\n\n238\n00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.290\n>> Yeah, and this is important.\n\n239\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.690\nOne of the things that I really like, what\nwe're doing as we're putting our cost into\n\n240\n00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.300\nthe project, and we're attaching the\nactivities, which gives them a date to.\n\n241\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.170\nSo at the end of the day when Ronny's done\nadding all this stuff in we'll enough,\n\n242\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.800\nexactly how much this\nproject is gonna cost?\n\n243\n00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.170\nMaybe it's $1.2 million project.\n\n244\n00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.210\nSo, does that mean I need a check for\n$1.2 million project on day one?\n\n245\n00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.810\nWell, you could do it that way, right?\n\n246\n00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.310\nYour company could say, here it is,\nyou've got your budget.\n\n247\n00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.120\nHere's $1.2 million sitting in the bank,\n\n248\n00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.680\ndole it out as your project\nneeds all the way to completion.\n\n249\n00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.090\nRight, but\nmost companies don't work that way.\n\n250\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.150\nMost companies say, okay,\n\n251\n00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.300\nyou've got a $1.2 million project,\nhow much money do you need per month?\n\n252\n00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.910\nAnd let's dole out on a monthly basis.\n\n253\n00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.240\nWell, Ronnie can pull up all\nthe activities for August.\n\n254\n00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.120\nAnd sorry, what's that add up to?\n\n255\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.030\nAll right, my budget for\nAugust is only $200,000.\n\n256\n00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.070\nSo, I just need $200,000 for August.\n\n257\n00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.770\nMy company might not\neven have $1.2 million.\n\n258\n00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.320\nIt might just know,\nhey this is a six month project.\n\n259\n00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.360\nOver the course of six months,\nwe'll make $1.2 million, and\n\n260\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.170\nso let's just dole it out as we get it.\n\n261\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.220\nSo now there's a little risk there, the\nmoney might dry up and you might lose it.\n\n262\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.180\nBut by putting it in like Ronnie was\ndoing here, we can do a cost schedule.\n\n263\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.680\nWe can look at our calendar and\nfigure out when we need that money.\n\n264\n00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.800\nThat's a very valuable thing.\n\n265\n00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.640\nWe'll see that more in the reporting\nsection of this show, but\n\n266\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.920\nfor now just understand there's\na two-fold benefit to this.\n\n267\n00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.060\nNow a big cost,\nlike you mentioned Ronnie, so\n\n268\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.350\nlet's say I know that I'm gonna\nneed a dump truck for this project.\n\n269\n00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:01.365\nI'm gonna need it so much that it makes\nsense to buy it versus renting it, right.\n\n270\n00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:03.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You have to do that, the whole make or\n\n271\n00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.210\nbuy decision and stuff,\nthat occurs inside of a project.\n\n272\n00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.250\nSo maybe you put it in here as rentals\noriginally, and then we add up all\n\n273\n00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.160\nthe rentals and we're like, holy molly\nwe can just buy the thing, right?\n\n274\n00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.490\nSo we turn around and we buy one.\n\n275\n00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.310\nWell, if you're gonna buy that dump truck,\nthere's a cost associated with that right?\n\n276\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.580\nAnd you could do that as\na cost to your company, and\n\n277\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.020\nthen your project benefits from it or you\ncan do it as a cost to the project itself.\n\n278\n00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.840\nAnd that's something we need to track,\nthat's like a one-time purchase.\n\n279\n00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.260\nAnd you have to make\na tough decision there,\n\n280\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.940\nbecause we could do that as a material or\na cost, couldn't we, Ronnie?\n\n281\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.215\n>> We really can, and so\ndepending on how you set that up.\n\n282\n00:13:37.215 --> 00:13:39.735\nThat's what's gonna end up happening is\nthat either you're gonna actually say,\n\n283\n00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:41.795\nlook I assigned this now as a material.\n\n284\n00:13:41.795 --> 00:13:43.355\nWhat's gonna end up happening?\n\n285\n00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:46.285\nWell, remember what we're actually\nnormally saying with material is\n\n286\n00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:47.865\nwe're gonna kind of prorate that.\n\n287\n00:13:47.865 --> 00:13:49.695\nIn other words, over that schedule and\n\n288\n00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:51.622\nthat time kind of be able\nto distribute it out.\n\n289\n00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:55.810\nBut if we do that fixed cost,\njust as a cost resource.\n\n290\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.852\nWe're just gonna say look, we're gonna\ncome out with the money for right here,\n\n291\n00:13:58.852 --> 00:13:59.692\nright now.\n\n292\n00:13:59.692 --> 00:14:03.482\nAnd we're saying that that money is spent,\nand it's done and it's over with.\n\n293\n00:14:03.482 --> 00:14:07.122\nSo it really depends on how you need\nto look at it inside of your project.\n\n294\n00:14:07.122 --> 00:14:08.422\n>> Yeah, another thing is.\n\n295\n00:14:08.422 --> 00:14:10.900\nLet's pull your project up again, Ronnie.\n\n296\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.370\nRonnie has some activities like\ninstalling the cable, right?\n\n297\n00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.980\nIf you look at activity 3.1 there,\ninstall premise cabling, right?\n\n298\n00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.750\nWell, that activity is\nactually installing the cable.\n\n299\n00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.060\nWe really should already have\nthe cable by that point, right?\n\n300\n00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.980\nSo what I'll typically do is break these\ndown, and we have to careful, all right?\n\n301\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.650\nIf you're PMI trained about the 880 rule,\n\n302\n00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:34.660\nwhich is every activity should be more\nthan eight hours, but less than 80 hours.\n\n303\n00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.350\nIf it's less than eight hours\nthen you're micromanaging.\n\n304\n00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.490\nIf it's more than 80 hours,\nyou're not breaking it down enough.\n\n305\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.010\nAnd you're setting yourself up for\nfailure.\n\n306\n00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.950\nBut that's not a hard, fast rule,\nthat's just like PMI's guideline.\n\n307\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.650\nSo, when you look at something like\ninstalling the cabling-well, Ronnie's got\n\n308\n00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.570\n72 hours assigned over 3 days, so\nit's a good bit- 72 hours over 3 days?\n\n309\n00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.350\nHow many people are assigned to that?\n\n310\n00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.680\nSo, anyhow,\nit's a good bit of work, right?\n\n311\n00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.860\nBut, if they come in that morning,\nwe just ordered the cable that morning.\n\n312\n00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.532\nHow much work did they need to get done?\n\n313\n00:15:03.532 --> 00:15:04.032\n>> None.\n>> None?\n\n314\n00:15:04.032 --> 00:15:05.730\nWe need to get the cable ahead of time.\n\n315\n00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.810\nWe normally break this apart even more and\n\n316\n00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.870\nsay, yeah we're not gonna install\nthe cable until July 1st.\n\n317\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.150\nBut we need to order the cable June 15th\n\n318\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.250\nto make sure we have it in time for\nJuly 1st.\n\n319\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:23.150\nSo now the cost, this material cost\nthat we think of as attached to this one\n\n320\n00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.410\nactivity is actually a few weeks\nahead of time as part of that.\n\n321\n00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.330\nAnd so what we'll normally do\nis create a separate task,\n\n322\n00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.690\nwhich is purchase cabling, or\npurchase materials for cable install.\n\n323\n00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.060\nKeep it real generic and\nattach the materials there,\n\n324\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.150\nas opposed to attaching the materials\nto the actual installation.\n\n325\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.410\nBecause we should purchase them and\n\n326\n00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.860\nhave them available before\nwe move on to the next one.\n\n327\n00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.460\nAnd you can create a dependency.\n\n328\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.080\nBetween those two activities and\n\n329\n00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.220\nset a lead time in there that\nmatches your shipping time.\n\n330\n00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.240\nOr it would be a lag time in this case,\nright?\n\n331\n00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.640\nSo if it took two weeks for\nme to procure the cables and get them.\n\n332\n00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.940\nI need a two week lag time\nin there to put the delay.\n\n333\n00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.644\nAnd that way if I move the activities,\n\n334\n00:15:59.644 --> 00:16:01.834\nthat'll move them around\nbased on their needs.\n\n335\n00:16:01.834 --> 00:16:04.542\nSo you can get kind of specific on this.\n\n336\n00:16:04.542 --> 00:16:07.792\nAnd it is important to be that way\nbecause you need to make sure.\n\n337\n00:16:07.792 --> 00:16:09.543\nHey, they're gonna be installing\nthat cabling on Monday.\n\n338\n00:16:09.543 --> 00:16:11.000\nHave we received that cabling?\n\n339\n00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.834\nHas that happened?\n\n340\n00:16:11.834 --> 00:16:16.058\nSo you might set a order the cabling,\nand then create a milestone for\n\n341\n00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:18.230\nreceive the shipment.\n\n342\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.350\nAnd as that milestone approaches you\ncan say, have we received it yet?\n\n343\n00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.410\nIs the cable on back order?\n\n344\n00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:23.520\nDo we need to find another vendor?\n\n345\n00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.510\nDo we need to order that or\nexpedite the shipping?\n\n346\n00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.240\nDo we need to throw a little extra money\nin there to get this thing done faster?\n\n347\n00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.260\nOr are we doing okay?\n\n348\n00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.850\nWe got the cable, the milestone hits.\n\n349\n00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.740\nWe've got everything.\n\n350\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.500\nWe are ready to install on Monday, right.\n\n351\n00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.040\nThat's all part of\nmanaging these materials.\n\n352\n00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.260\nJust because you've attached them there\ndoesn't mean the materials are gonna\n\n353\n00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.972\nmagically manifest themselves.\n\n354\n00:16:41.972 --> 00:16:43.991\nWe need, that would be kinda cool.\n\n355\n00:16:43.991 --> 00:16:45.295\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we do need to make sure that we've\n\n356\n00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:46.905\nordered them and that we've procured them.\n\n357\n00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:50.155\nSo there might be some other accounting\npractices that have to happen.\n\n358\n00:16:50.155 --> 00:16:50.685\n>> Right.\nSo\n\n359\n00:16:50.685 --> 00:16:52.545\nwhen we start taking a look\nat something like that,\n\n360\n00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:55.875\nremember once you actually figure out\nhow you're going to get it ordered and\n\n361\n00:16:55.875 --> 00:16:59.205\nput into place, I didn't do any\nof that purchasing side of it.\n\n362\n00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:01.755\nSo the only thing I actually did,\nand Don would know this,\n\n363\n00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:03.891\nis he just said, here's the switch,\nRonnie, put it in.\n\n364\n00:17:03.891 --> 00:17:04.545\n>> [LAUGH] Get to work.\n\n365\n00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:07.960\nSo when I did it, yeah,\nit was just, get it to work.\n\n366\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.070\nI didn't think about that cost side Don,\nbut right here I went ahead and\n\n367\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:14.520\nalso accounted for the switch as well.\n\n368\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.980\nIf you go ahead and do that then you\nsimply go ahead and assign that.\n\n369\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.540\nLet me see if I can go\nback to the information.\n\n370\n00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.600\nAnd on installing that switch,\nI go down to resources here.\n\n371\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.630\nAnd this one I think I set\nup as a material resource.\n\n372\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.460\nI'm not sure exactly.\n\n373\n00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.420\nLet's see.\nNope.\n\n374\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.400\nI set it up as just a one time cost here.\n\n375\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.300\nSo let's say we got a 3640 switch, and\n\n376\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.380\nI don't have a clue how\nmuch that thing costs.\n\n377\n00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.460\nI'm gonna say $1200.\n\n378\n00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.660\nI can add that in there for\nthat one cost and associate that.\n\n379\n00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.770\nAnd then if I right click and\ngo back to information,\n\n380\n00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.200\nI can see under the resources now it\nalso added in that cost for us for\n\n381\n00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.220\nthat one time piece that we're also\nassociating with that one task.\n\n382\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.130\nSo it is helpful, right?\n\n383\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.800\nBecause we're not actually\nworking on the project yet.\n\n384\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.360\nWe're trying to model all the cost\nthat we're gonna have associated\n\n385\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.150\nwith this particular project so\n\n386\n00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.440\nthat when it does get time and ready then\nI can hand that to Don, say here it is.\n\n387\n00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.800\nAnd Don says,\nwell you're $4000 over budget.\n\n388\n00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.220\nOr Don says, oh no you're well within\nbudget, let's go ahead and get started and\n\n389\n00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.170\nstart ordering everything that we need to.\n\n390\n00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:21.360\nAnd that's what we're trying to do.\n\n391\n00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.970\nWe wanna make sure that we account for not\nonly work resources, material resources,\n\n392\n00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:29.760\nas well as those fixed cost resources\ninside of our project plan that we have\n\n393\n00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:35.090\na nice full accounting of just about\neverything that we can think of.\n\n394\n00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.310\n>> It is important to know though\nthat Ronnie, your way is not wrong.\n\n395\n00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.860\nIt all comes down to how we use Project.\n\n396\n00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.850\nIf you're strictly using Project just\nas the project management piece for\n\n397\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.030\nmanaging the employees and making sure\nthings are where they're supposed to be,\n\n398\n00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.930\nthen doing it Ronnie's way makes sense.\n\n399\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.910\nBut Ronnie's way requires us\nto have some kind of extra\n\n400\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.120\npiece to manage the other things.\n\n401\n00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.770\nAnd a lot of companies do.\n\n402\n00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.770\nYou might have procurement software.\n\n403\n00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.350\nYou might have procurement agents.\n\n404\n00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.770\nAnd they manage that stuff.\n\n405\n00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.190\nSo they look at the project and\nthey're like wow,\n\n406\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.060\nRonnie's expecting to have 1,000\nfeet of cabling on Monday.\n\n407\n00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.870\nI need to go into my software and\nmake sure the purchase is entered in.\n\n408\n00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.040\nYou see this with governments.\n\n409\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.330\nLook at the United States government.\n\n410\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.850\nWe gotta look for the GSA schedule that\nincludes purchasing, that cabling, and\n\n411\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.220\ngo through that process.\n\n412\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.820\nProject can't do that.\n\n413\n00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.650\nSo that's completely outside of project.\n\n414\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.190\nSo if you've got a secondary\nsystem that's handling purchasing,\n\n415\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.310\nthen sending up the way that Ronnie\ndid is the way you want to do it.\n\n416\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.210\nBut if you're using Project to track\nit off, you're trying to be holistic,\n\n417\n00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.860\ncapture the whole set of events,\n\n418\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.840\nincluding the accounting practices,\nthen you want to create those extra ones.\n\n419\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.270\nIt's not about one being right or\n\n420\n00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.210\nwrong, it's about which one\nworks in your environment.\n\n421\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.956\nAnd everybody's environment's a little\nbit different, as far as the resources,\n\n422\n00:19:43.956 --> 00:19:46.740\nI mean the project management\nresources you have available.\n\n423\n00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.960\nNot necessarily the resources\non your project.\n\n424\n00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.990\nThat's confusing, isn't it?\n\n425\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.698\n>> It really is.\n\n426\n00:19:50.698 --> 00:19:52.628\n>> That's not a good way to end the show.\n\n427\n00:19:52.628 --> 00:19:55.980\nSo just take into account the things\nthat your company has, right?\n\n428\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.690\nYour organizational process assets,\n\n429\n00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.760\nI'm gonna break out all\nthe cool PMI keywords today.\n\n430\n00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.630\n>> You should.\n\n431\n00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.025\n>> So all of the things that are part\nof how your company does business,\n\n432\n00:20:03.025 --> 00:20:05.225\nthat's gonna influence\nhow you use Project.\n\n433\n00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:06.065\nAll right,\n\n434\n00:20:06.065 --> 00:20:09.415\nwell, Ronnie, I think that's a pretty\ngood run down of our material resources.\n\n435\n00:20:09.415 --> 00:20:10.625\nYou got anything else to throw in?\n\n436\n00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:13.545\n>> Just remember, the more that you work\nwith it, the better you're gonna be at it.\n\n437\n00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:17.170\nThere are so many little details in\nhere that can really trip you up.\n\n438\n00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:21.090\nHandling resources, getting everything\nready for our project plan to get in use,\n\n439\n00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.300\nis really part of the goal\nof why we use Project, so\n\n440\n00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.770\nthat we can monitor everything.\n\n441\n00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:26.800\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n442\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.570\nmake sure that you're actually\nworking with it as much as you can.\n\n443\n00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.700\n>> Yeah, and work smarter,\nnot harder, right?\n\n444\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.170\nThat's the rule.\n\n445\n00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.080\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nwe'll go ahead and wrap it up here.\n\n446\n00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.540\nHope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n447\n00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.090\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pizet.\n\n448\n00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.520\n>> I'm Ron Wong.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n449\n00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.419\n[NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:17.230\nToday we're specifically taking\na look at Microsoft Project.\n\n4\n00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.080\nI'll be your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.440\nAs we start taking a look\nat Microsoft Project,\n\n6\n00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.890\nwe can actually set\nwhat we call baselines.\n\n7\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.060\nNow you may be wondering about\nwhat the heck is a baseline and\n\n8\n00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.730\nwhy would we actually want to use it.\n\n9\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.765\nBut up into this point,\nwhat we've done in our series so\n\n10\n00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:34.834\nfar is that we went ahead and was able\nto start putting all of the information\n\n11\n00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.793\nthat we need to track in our project\ninside of Microsoft Project itself.\n\n12\n00:00:38.793 --> 00:00:42.082\nWe also went ahead and\nassigned resources to those tasks and\n\n13\n00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:44.200\nalso showed you how to do that as well.\n\n14\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.058\nNow once you have everything in place,\n\n15\n00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:49.947\nyou might have also began to see where you\ncould start assigning different costs or\n\n16\n00:00:49.947 --> 00:00:52.720\nseeing different costs\nassociated with a project plan.\n\n17\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.570\nAnd so when everything is ready to go and\nyou think, now I have the perfect\n\n18\n00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.600\nproject plan, and that you are ready\nto get started and working.\n\n19\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.230\nBut one of the things that you\nwant to make sure that you do,\n\n20\n00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.590\nis you want to set up what\nwe call a project baseline.\n\n21\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.610\nA project baseline is\nessentially a snap shot\n\n22\n00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.410\nof what that project plan looks like\nright now before you start actually\n\n23\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.200\ntracking any of the information as your\nproject now gets its first start and\n\n24\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.770\nyou're starting to enter in information\nto start tracking how things are going.\n\n25\n00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.060\nAnd the reason why that's gonna be\nimportant to you is because later on,\n\n26\n00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.560\nas you start working more and\n\n27\n00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.110\nmore, you might lose sight of what\nthe project was supposed to be like.\n\n28\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.000\nBy being able to keep a baseline it gives\nyou the ability to be able to compare\n\n29\n00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.990\nwhere you are right then versus where you\nthought you would be at that point in time\n\n30\n00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.100\nsince you have all the details and all\nof the data inside of Microsoft Project.\n\n31\n00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.260\nSo we want to show you today,\n\n32\n00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.600\nof course, how to actually work with the,\nset up a project baseline.\n\n33\n00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.050\nWe also want to talk about the reasons why\nwe might choose to use multiple baselines\n\n34\n00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.635\nand then show you how to\nupdate baselines as well.\n\n35\n00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:03.605\nSo, let's go ahead and get started.\n\n36\n00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:05.645\nSo, on my computer I went ahead and\n\n37\n00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:09.227\nopened up a project plan that we've been\nworking with throughout the series here.\n\n38\n00:02:09.227 --> 00:02:11.445\nAnd let's say that everything that I have,\n\n39\n00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:14.707\nat least as far as I can tell,\nis ready to go, right?\n\n40\n00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:18.627\nWe have all the tasks that we actually\nthought we would need to actually work on.\n\n41\n00:02:18.627 --> 00:02:22.377\nWe went ahead and\nset up estimated duration's, as well.\n\n42\n00:02:22.377 --> 00:02:27.307\nAnd we even have a project start date,\nand all of the tasks are linked up.\n\n43\n00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:28.757\nAnd it's probably a lot easier for\n\n44\n00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:33.507\nme to see if I take a look at it from\nthe Gantt chart point of view as well.\n\n45\n00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:37.282\nScroll it, go ahead and\nscroll over here and start taking a look.\n\n46\n00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.184\nSo this way you can see the layout and\n\n47\n00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:43.053\nthe flow of that project as we begin\nto get started in the Gantt chart, and\n\n48\n00:02:43.053 --> 00:02:48.070\nyou can see where all of those assignments\nhave been done the way that we need to.\n\n49\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.480\nAnd now as we scroll on through and we\nbelieve that we are ready to get started,\n\n50\n00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.860\nwe've got a couple of things in\nmind that we want to keep track of.\n\n51\n00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.070\nLet's go ahead and click on project and\nthen I'm gonna go to project information.\n\n52\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.120\nAnd in project information,\nwhat I'm looking for\n\n53\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.370\nright here is this statistic button, which\napparently I can't say too many S's here.\n\n54\n00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.610\nSo when we take a look, notice that\nright there at the very top line,\n\n55\n00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.860\nI have what is considered, even though\nbefore anything is actually entered in,\n\n56\n00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.670\nnow what I believe is my\nperfect project plan, right?\n\n57\n00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.970\nThe current start date for this project\nis gonna be a little bit in the future,\n\n58\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.480\na couple of weeks from now, and\n\n59\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.920\nit's actually scheduled to finish about\nsix weeks or so from now as well.\n\n60\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.250\nAnd you can see the current duration, and\nthe overall amount of work to be done in\n\n61\n00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.350\nterms of work hours, and\nthe total cost for this project.\n\n62\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.870\nNotice directly underneath it though,\nyou actually have this baseline and\n\n63\n00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.630\nit says NA.\n\n64\n00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.720\nNA means that it's not applicable right\nnow because there is no snapshot,\n\n65\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.910\nthere is no picture in time that I'm\nactually preserving right now so\n\n66\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.810\nthat I know what could actually happen\nas I start updating different things.\n\n67\n00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.750\nSo, that is the first thing that\nwe want to do, is go ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.020\nset up this baseline for us to make\nsure that we can actually use it.\n\n69\n00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.340\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and click close\non the project information dialog box and\n\n70\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.875\nwhen I do that, that's perfectly fine,\nthat's what we want, but inside\n\n71\n00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:16.275\nof the project tab, what we're looking for\nis the schedule grouping right here.\n\n72\n00:04:16.275 --> 00:04:20.465\nAnd under schedule grouping you'll see\nan icon that says set baseline, and\n\n73\n00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:23.335\nit says it right there,\ntake a snapshot of your schedule that\n\n74\n00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:28.530\nincludes information about tasks,\nresources and assignments as well.\n\n75\n00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.610\nAnd what's gonna happen is this\nis gonna go ahead and do that,\n\n76\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.290\nit's gonna freeze in time a picture for\nus of the tasks that we have available,\n\n77\n00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.910\nof the resources that are assigned and\nthose assignments, and\n\n78\n00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.310\nalso the project start date and\nfinish date that we've got set.\n\n79\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.400\nSo, if I go ahead and select that I\ncan also select set baseline, and\n\n80\n00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.630\nfrom here I'm gonna work inside\nof this dialogue box too.\n\n81\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.150\nRight now there is no project baseline set\nup, but if I click on the drop down box,\n\n82\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.370\nnotice it gives me the ability\nto save up to 11 baselines.\n\n83\n00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.110\nSo it does say you want one through ten,\nbut remember I actually have one here\n\n84\n00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.590\nthat's also unnumbered and so it's not\nactually saved anything at this point.\n\n85\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.680\nWe're gonna talk about Inter Room\nProject Plans in just a moment, and\n\n86\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.790\nI have an option whether I'm gonna\nsave it for the entire project or for\n\n87\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.082\na selected task as well.\n\n88\n00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:23.250\nLet me go ahead and do it for the entire\nproject right now to set up a baseline.\n\n89\n00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.550\nSo if I just select that and I click okay,\nbelieve it or not, it's just that simple.\n\n90\n00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.190\nIt is just like a photograph that you and\nI take of anything that we wanted to\n\n91\n00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.290\npreserve as a memory so that later on\nwe go back and look and go, oh yeah I\n\n92\n00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.360\nremember that time and day, and look at\nwhere we are right now in comparison.\n\n93\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.630\nSo if I now go back to the project and\nproject information, and\n\n94\n00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.530\nI select statistic,\n\n95\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.720\nI can see now that it's preserved this\nbaseline inside of project for me.\n\n96\n00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.310\nAnd now that I have it preserved,\nif my project plan now begins to change,\n\n97\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.180\nwhat should happen in that statistic box\nis that we should see that the current\n\n98\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.980\nnumbers will change while\nthe project baseline stays the same.\n\n99\n00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.400\nSo this is a quick and\n\n100\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.380\neasy summary glance at what a baseline\nwill help us to be able to do.\n\n101\n00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.540\nNow, if you're like me and\nyou go okay so a baseline sounds great,\n\n102\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.930\nright at the beginning of the project,\nwe go ahead and set it up.\n\n103\n00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.030\nRonnie, you pointed out that\nyou could actually have up to,\n\n104\n00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.320\nwell, eleven separate baselines.\n\n105\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.790\nSo, if I select that again,\nI went up to schedule and set baseline,\n\n106\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.080\nnotice it just tells me right there,\nthat now I have a baseline set,\n\n107\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.820\nnormally inside of the parentheses it will\nshow you what date that you set it on.\n\n108\n00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.760\nSo it actually does show that we just\nsaved it here on Monday the 20th, and\n\n109\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.780\nnow notice I still have ten other\nbaselines that I can set there.\n\n110\n00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.660\nNow you may be wondering like I am, why\ndo they give us ten different baselines\n\n111\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.450\nto actually be able to\nset up if we need to?\n\n112\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.960\nSo let's say as an example here that\nI've got this set up and everything\n\n113\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.520\nis ready to go, and now all of a sudden\nsomebody says, well let's go ahead and\n\n114\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.450\ndo something else since it looks like\nthat we're doing pretty good here.\n\n115\n00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.950\nLet's add in another task or another\n\n116\n00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:16.080\ncouple of different scope requirements\nthat we want to add in to the project.\n\n117\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.360\nNow you already say, hey, I know that\nthis is gonna complete at this point,\n\n118\n00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.620\nat least from everything\nI've projected out, and\n\n119\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.950\nnow they increased the scope requirements\nor they changed something, and\n\n120\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.650\nnow you have to go back and\nactually be able to take a look at it now.\n\n121\n00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.290\nAnd now, even though you have\nthe original date you can now see\n\n122\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.130\nwhat the difference would be from what you\nactually had originally started out with\n\n123\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.960\nto now where you might actually add\nin that second requirement, and\n\n124\n00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.150\nthen you could take another\nbaseline if you wanted to.\n\n125\n00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.390\nSo if now you actually ended up\nhaving that, where you added in\n\n126\n00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.780\nanother requirement, so I'm simply\ngoing to go ahead and do that as well.\n\n127\n00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.464\nSo let's say that right here under the\nDeploying Phase, I'm gonna right click on\n\n128\n00:07:57.464 --> 00:08:02.240\n16 and go to Insert a Task, and we'll\njust call this the New Task right now.\n\n129\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.650\nAnd if I go ahead and select that and\nstart adding in different resources\n\n130\n00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:11.960\nto that task,\nwe'll start making some expenditures here.\n\n131\n00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.150\nTo do so scroll on over here and and\njust select a few different tasks.\n\n132\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:22.210\nDo them, go and add that in, and\n\n133\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:27.000\nnotice I've added in about 32 hours\nof work, perfectly fine for us.\n\n134\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.610\nAnd even though I haven't actually\nadded in any other tasks or\n\n135\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.140\nwhat the description is it doesn't really\ncare so much, the project does it, but\n\n136\n00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.180\nnotice, I went ahead and\nstarted adding in that information.\n\n137\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:43.240\nSo, at this point, if this was\nthe new task that I had set up for\n\n138\n00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.390\nme after I took my initial baseline,\nI can go back to project information and\n\n139\n00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.510\nsee that statistic again and\nnow as we start to update,\n\n140\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.500\nyou can see now the difference\nas far as the time.\n\n141\n00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.500\nNotice that if we come\ndown here under duration,\n\n142\n00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.380\nit's still taking about the same time,\ncuz I didn't add in any duration.\n\n143\n00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.000\nBut I did add in some work hours, you can\ntell the difference between 562 and 594,\n\n144\n00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.230\nand it actually increased my\noverall cost at this point, too.\n\n145\n00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.500\nSo, if I know that this is gonna happen,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n146\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.840\nBut if I work from that point and\nI don't start I may think\n\n147\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.040\nthat I'm already off budget right at\nthe beginning of my project, right?\n\n148\n00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.190\nSo instead I can go back now and\nselect set base line,\n\n149\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.230\nset another one and\nthis time I can go ahead and say, hey,\n\n150\n00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:37.261\nI'm gonna set a new base line one and\nclick okay.\n\n151\n00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:43.760\nOnce I do that, it's not gonna up show\nunder the project information right away\n\n152\n00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.860\nbecause that one's actually reserved for\nthe original, but\n\n153\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.570\nif I needed to now see my second baseline,\nI would simply go ahead and\n\n154\n00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.210\nstart tracking that\na little bit differently.\n\n155\n00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.280\nSo, later on, as now actually I'm starting\nto work off that new baseline instead,\n\n156\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.490\nI can go to task and\n\n157\n00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.186\nthen here under the Gantt chart.\n\n158\n00:10:07.186 --> 00:10:12.546\nIt is the task usage view, I believe, and\n\n159\n00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:20.440\nits from here we can change\na couple of different things.\n\n160\n00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.290\nSo when I do this I'm actually starting\nto see all the work that I also added in.\n\n161\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:30.130\nBut now once I've changed that task\nusage view, I can go under the view and\n\n162\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:36.180\nunder tables and\nit's here that I can go to more tables and\n\n163\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.140\nif I scroll up to the top\nI can see the base lines.\n\n164\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.060\nSo here's the original base line that I\nhave as far as the different costs go, but\n\n165\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.520\nnotice I don't actually have the other\ninformation that I would need.\n\n166\n00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.780\nWell it's here that we would go ahead and\n\n167\n00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.501\nstart adding in the baseline\none duration's.\n\n168\n00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:01.820\nNow I might now add in\nbaseline one duration,\n\n169\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.210\nand now you can actually see if\nI scroll down, let's see here,\n\n170\n00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.530\nto the new task wherever that\nthing actually went on to.\n\n171\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.880\nWe should start seeing that information\nand also the start and the finish,\n\n172\n00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.530\nwe didn't do anything, but\nthe work we did add in.\n\n173\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.710\nSo let me add that one in there.\n\n174\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.370\nBaseline one, work.\n\n175\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.910\nLet's see if I can scroll\ndown to find that one.\n\n176\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.690\nHere too.\n\n177\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.180\nSo now when you start seeing\nthe information it should come in,\n\n178\n00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.070\nif I can actually find that one\ntask that I was on under deploying.\n\n179\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:36.598\nThere it is.\n\n180\n00:11:36.598 --> 00:11:38.990\nSo line 16.\n\n181\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.940\nYou can see right here where I\nadded those 32 hours in as well for\n\n182\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.660\nthat new baseline and\nthat helps me to account for.\n\n183\n00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.510\nIt can give you up to ten different\ndays to actually be able to do that\n\n184\n00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.460\nif that's what you're actually working on.\n\n185\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.560\nIf you wanna preserve the original\nproject information and\n\n186\n00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.700\nthen also be able to work\noff of the new baseline,\n\n187\n00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.540\nthat's how you can actually begin to see\nthat and work with it and do that as well.\n\n188\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.530\nSo there's a lot of different reasons\nwhy you might choose that, right?\n\n189\n00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.130\nAnd so I just gave you one of them.\n\n190\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:11.290\nIf you actually start finding out later on\nthat your project has completely changed,\n\n191\n00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.760\nagain setting those multiple baselines\nwill give you that snapshot again\n\n192\n00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.530\nthat you compare it to at\nthat point in your project.\n\n193\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.600\nSo, there's a lot of good reasons for\nyou to be able to do that.\n\n194\n00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.820\nNow, there's also some other things\nthat we solved there too, so\n\n195\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:29.100\nlet me go ahead and go back to\nthe Regular Gantt Chart as well.\n\n196\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:35.560\nWe also can take a look at\nthe interim baselines as well.\n\n197\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:41.560\nSo I go back to Project, and I select Set\nBaseline, and I can select Set Baseline.\n\n198\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.160\nI now see something else about\nthe interim project plan too.\n\n199\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.600\nNow you might be wondering, what in\nthe world is this interim project plan?\n\n200\n00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.050\nThe interim project plan actually\ndoesn't save any of the other data\n\n201\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.900\nthat your baseline does.\n\n202\n00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.630\nYour baseline will take a snapshot\nof your project's duration,\n\n203\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.570\nof the work that's also associated,\nand the cost that's associated.\n\n204\n00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.230\nIt will take a snapshot of the start\ndate and the finish date as well.\n\n205\n00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.330\nSo it is a complete snapshot\nof your project plan.\n\n206\n00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.570\nThe interim, it only takes a look\nat the start and finish dates.\n\n207\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.110\nSo if you actually were, let's say,\ndelayed for one reason or\n\n208\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.760\nanother, everything else\nremained the same, right?\n\n209\n00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.040\nWe didn't add a new requirement in.\n\n210\n00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.260\nBut we were actually gonna be delayed\nlet's say three weeks because\n\n211\n00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.976\nwe just knew that we couldn't get it in\nbecause all of our resources were not\n\n212\n00:13:27.976 --> 00:13:31.150\ngonna actually be available into that\npoint even though we thought that\n\n213\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.860\neverything was scheduled correctly.\n\n214\n00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.890\nWell then we might just be delaying\njust the project start and finish date.\n\n215\n00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.950\nSo that way we can now preserve\nthe original finish date and\n\n216\n00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.350\nnow set a new interim project plan for\nnew start dates and new finish dates, and\n\n217\n00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.060\nnow we can actually work off of that\nwithout having to change everything over\n\n218\n00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.720\nto be able to do that as well.\n\n219\n00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.340\nSo there's another option there for\nyou to be able to do that.\n\n220\n00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.490\nNow, there's also the option,\nof course, for\n\n221\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.410\nyou to update a project\nbaseline if you choose to.\n\n222\n00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:06.040\nNow, my recommendation is that you\ndon't update project baselines.\n\n223\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.070\nCan you do it?\nYes.\n\n224\n00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.300\nDo people do it all the time?\n\n225\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.260\nProbably.\n\n226\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.070\nAs they do that.\n\n227\n00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.900\nSo the example that I gave a little\nbit earlier is you go, look,\n\n228\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.780\nI don't really care about tracking\nthat historical information\n\n229\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.930\nabout the original baselines that I\nhave set before I begin my project.\n\n230\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.470\nI just want to actually\nmake this my new base line.\n\n231\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.370\nWell simple,\nif you wanted to do something like that.\n\n232\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.970\nIf I go back up to the set base line and\nchoose that option again,\n\n233\n00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.420\nwhat I can do is select the baseline\nthat I want to overwrite.\n\n234\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.640\nSo, let's say I select that original one,\nand I'm gonna do this for\n\n235\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.250\nthe entire project and click okay.\n\n236\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:46.110\nWhen I do so, it's gonna say, hey, are you\nsure you want to overwrite this data?\n\n237\n00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.500\nIf I am, then it's at that point\nI would go ahead and say yes.\n\n238\n00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.570\nAnd then I would now have ended up\noverwriting that new baseline or\n\n239\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.910\nthat old baseline.\n\n240\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.730\nI go back into project information and\n\n241\n00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.890\nstatistics, I can now see that\nit updated my original baseline.\n\n242\n00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.980\nSo if you're not really interested\nin keeping track of that historical\n\n243\n00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.140\ninformation for comparison, later on\nas your project continues to develop\n\n244\n00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.220\nthen overriding baselines is another\noption for you to be able to do.\n\n245\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.740\nNow everything that I've done up in this\npoint has really helped me to go ahead and\n\n246\n00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.120\nbe able to select baselines for\n\n247\n00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.630\nthe entire project, and that normally\nis what small projects end up doing.\n\n248\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.700\nIt's that they wanna see that\ncomparison between the beginning and\n\n249\n00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.500\nthe ends there, and you may take\nthose baselines at different times.\n\n250\n00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.970\nSo you may actually choose a baseline\nwhen you finish a particular phase.\n\n251\n00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:41.120\nSo let's say that I finish my terminal\ntesting phase here on my project,\n\n252\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.180\nI may go ahead and just choose\nto baseline that for right now.\n\n253\n00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.130\nAnd then later on,\n\n254\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.050\nas I finish up the deploying phase,\nI may choose to do another baseline.\n\n255\n00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.080\nSo we can do that, and then that\ntesting phase, choose another one, and\n\n256\n00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.990\nset up all three of those so\nthat I can compare them\n\n257\n00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.540\nagainst the original baseline and\nbe able to track them.\n\n258\n00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:02.180\nIf I go to that baseline view I can add in\nall that information and be able to track\n\n259\n00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.240\nthe differences between all of them,\ntask by task if I've choose to.\n\n260\n00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.460\nSo, that's is an option that you\nhave available to you to be able\n\n261\n00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.130\nto do something like that.\n\n262\n00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.310\nBut, the other thing you\nmight actually do instead\n\n263\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.920\nis just baseline selected task instead.\n\n264\n00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.309\nAnd you might do this if you were doing\nsomething that we call a rolling phase or\n\n265\n00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:26.120\na type of deployment or\nchange in your project.\n\n266\n00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.970\nSo it might be where it actually is that,\nwhere you're actually only working on\n\n267\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.520\ncertain pieces at certain times and\nit's actually rolling along.\n\n268\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.736\nAnd what you want to do instead is that\nyou don't want to actually baseline\n\n269\n00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:39.000\nthe entire project every time.\n\n270\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.920\nJust like what I was talking about, right.\n\n271\n00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.060\nAt the end of tuning phase I'm going\nto baseline the entire project.\n\n272\n00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.190\nAt the end of the deploying phase\nI'm going to do the whole thing.\n\n273\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.260\nI may choose instead just to\nbaseline just that section.\n\n274\n00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.950\nLets say in the deployment phase\nI went ahead and I said look,\n\n275\n00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.780\nI wanna go ahead and\nbaseline this entire thing here.\n\n276\n00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.740\nI can choose all of these tasks here, and\n\n277\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:08.480\nthen I can go to Set Baseline and\nfrom there select Select a Task and\n\n278\n00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.190\nI can either roll up those baselines if I\nwant to, the Summary Task or also do that.\n\n279\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.400\nI'm just gonna leave it at it's default\nright now under Select a Task and\n\n280\n00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.070\nclick okay.\n\n281\n00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.220\nIt says, hey, there's already a base\nline used here, so let me go ahead and\n\n282\n00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.710\nselect another date, or\nanother base line, I should say.\n\n283\n00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.970\nAnd then I can do that.\n\n284\n00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.560\nNow, you might be wondering,\nwhy would I do that?\n\n285\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:34.550\nWell, what if I only wanted to compare my\noriginal deploying phase to now a new one?\n\n286\n00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.220\nWell, then we can go ahead and do that.\n\n287\n00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.780\nI've now saved this original base line,\n\n288\n00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.010\nas now other things start getting added\nin or start to change in my project plan.\n\n289\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.440\nWell I can now actually go to\nthe baseline number three.\n\n290\n00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.750\nAnd now save that information and\nthen I can compare those two\n\n291\n00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.490\nwithout actually having to see the entire\nproject plan and baseline to that too.\n\n292\n00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.917\nSo being able to select certain phases or\njust certain tasks to baseline,\n\n293\n00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:05.520\nbeing able to baseline the entire\nproject plan itself really is about\n\n294\n00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.050\nyou comparing to what you thought was\nactually the best of the original project\n\n295\n00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.210\nthat you had versus what is actually\nstarting to happen on your project\n\n296\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.350\nas you're now getting information coming\nin as you're actually starting to track.\n\n297\n00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.870\nSo it's a great tool for\n\n298\n00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.050\nyou if you are actually having to do\nthose comparisons, and normally you are.\n\n299\n00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.240\nYou're gonna actually try and\n\n300\n00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.470\ncompare, this is where I should be\nin my project but right now I'm not.\n\n301\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.840\nIf there's a work stoppage at some point\ndue to a hurricane coming through Florida,\n\n302\n00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.920\nlike that doesn't happen, and\nyou have to actually start two weeks\n\n303\n00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.530\nlater than you thought or you actually\nhave to stop work and restart it again.\n\n304\n00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.360\nDoing those types of baselines will really\nhelp you as you're setting new ones and\n\n305\n00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.890\neven those interim project plans as well.\n\n306\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:50.210\nAll right, so that's actually a good\nplace for us to go ahead and finish up.\n\n307\n00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.910\nRemember that what we took a look\nat here is the idea of setting up\n\n308\n00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.130\ndifferent baselines, making sure\nthat we can actually take a look and\n\n309\n00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:00.080\nsee where the information's coming\nfrom and how we also do it.\n\n310\n00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.960\nWell, that's all that we have for\nthis show.\n\n311\n00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.415\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie

00:00:15.130\nMy name is Ronnie Wong,\nI'll be your host today.\n\n4\n00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.906\nAnd today we're taking a look\nat Microsoft Project 2013.\n\n5\n00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:22.491\nAnd we're actually finally starting\nto get to this point in which\n\n6\n00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:26.960\nwe are actually entering in, well,\nupdating the project plan itself.\n\n7\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.620\nIn other words we are now beginning\nto monitor and track progress.\n\n8\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.074\nSo of course today what we wanna do is,\n\n9\n00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:36.605\nwe wanna walk you through how\nto actually take tasks and\n\n10\n00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:41.390\nupdate them as our progress and\nour project plan continues through time.\n\n11\n00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.173\nMaking sure that you understand that there\nare actually some different techniques\n\n12\n00:00:44.173 --> 00:00:45.495\nthat we can use.\n\n13\n00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:49.250\nAnd also to actually let you\nknow what you do tend to update\n\n14\n00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.220\nduring the progress of a project as well.\n\n15\n00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.980\nSo let's go ahead and get started as\nwe take a look at Microsoft Project and\n\n16\n00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.550\nof course updating the progress itself.\n\n17\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.770\nSo on my computer, I went ahead and\n\n18\n00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.080\nbrought up a project plan that we've been\nworking with throughout the course here.\n\n19\n00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.908\nSo as we get started, we wanna take a look\nat some of the different methods that we\n\n20\n00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:13.156\ncan use to update a project plan too.\n\n21\n00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.930\nNow when we start talking about updating,\nwell what are we normally updating?\n\n22\n00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.990\nWell remember that now\nthat we have our task,\n\n23\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.810\nin other words what we need to do,\nwe now have the people assigned to it, so\n\n24\n00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.200\nthat we actually know who's gonna\nbe working on that particular task.\n\n25\n00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.530\nWell, we need to now begin to account for,\nwell, as time is beginning to work on,\n\n26\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.920\nhow much of that task that\nthey're actually completing.\n\n27\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.060\nNow it's fairly easy,\n\n28\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.870\nyou can do a couple of different\nthings to help you out here, right?\n\n29\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.590\nSince we don't have\nanything in there already,\n\n30\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.680\nwe can just mark the task\nas being 100% complete.\n\n31\n00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.220\nAnd if we do that we're saying, hey,\nall of it's done we're accounting for it.\n\n32\n00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.880\nAnd we're gonna do that right now,\nand that's perfectly fine.\n\n33\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.908\nBut the reality is that\nthat's not always the truth.\n\n34\n00:01:53.908 --> 00:01:57.450\nAnd right then at that moment, that's\nwhen you're needing to give a report.\n\n35\n00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.280\nIf you actually need to know what\nthe progress of your project is gonna be,\n\n36\n00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.500\nwell then you're not actually\ngiving an accurate progress report.\n\n37\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.920\nSo what we wanna do is we want to take you\nthrough what is it that we actually need\n\n38\n00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.290\nto update and how do we actually do\nthat inside of Microsoft Project itself?\n\n39\n00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.810\nOf course, like anything else,\n\n40\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.190\nMicrosoft gives you a thousand\nways to give yourself a paper cut.\n\n41\n00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.020\nAnd here inside a project it is\nno different when it comes to\n\n42\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.970\nupdating progress inside of our project.\n\n43\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.668\nThey give you so many different ways,\n\n44\n00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:28.240\nit's hard to know which way is actually\nthe way that you should do it.\n\n45\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.700\nSo it comes down to your preference\nas to what it actually comes down to,\n\n46\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.965\nwhen we first begin to take a look here.\n\n47\n00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:36.750\nSo let me give you an example\nof what I'm talking about.\n\n48\n00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.050\nSo I've just selected one of these tasks.\n\n49\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.660\nLet's say that we've already gone\nthrough the testing phase, and\n\n50\n00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.990\nwe are now in the midst of\nour deploying phase here.\n\n51\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.430\nThere's a couple of things\nthat you might need to do.\n\n52\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.410\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the first thing.\n\n53\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.560\nEven though it isn't actually for\nour time period right now,\n\n54\n00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.970\nwe are actually a month away from\nthis project plan getting started.\n\n55\n00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.570\nBut let's say that I was\nbeginning to track it already.\n\n56\n00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.400\nIn other words,\nlet's say we're already there at\n\n57\n00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.770\nthe 20th of August,\nto actually get started.\n\n58\n00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.190\nWell if I go ahead and\nstart entering in information right now,\n\n59\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.190\nwell today's date is actually\nabout a month before that.\n\n60\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.001\nSo the progress is not gonna actually seem\nlike what it needs to in the reality of\n\n61\n00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.195\nwhat we're tracking.\n\n62\n00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:27.130\nSo if I can go up to Project and\nI can go to Project Information.\n\n63\n00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.100\nInside of my Project Information for\n\n64\n00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.770\nmy Project Plan,\nI wanna actually change the current date.\n\n65\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.700\nIf I thought that I was actually now,\nlet's say a couple of days into it.\n\n66\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.400\nSo let's say that I should go to\nAugust 2015 and instead of it actually\n\n67\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.190\nbeing the 20th, let's say it is\nthe 24th at this point in time instead.\n\n68\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.540\nAnd I click OK.\n\n69\n00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.870\nAnd it doesn't actually look\nlike it makes any change at all.\n\n70\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.840\nBut it's right there that\nwhat I'm actually saying is,\n\n71\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.020\nI've now gotten some information and\nI need to begin updating my progress.\n\n72\n00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.110\nAnd so I'm actually looking\nback in four days of time, and\n\n73\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.230\nwhat can actually happen from that point.\n\n74\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.358\nSo we can update the very current date\nthat we're on to actually say hey,\n\n75\n00:04:07.358 --> 00:04:10.150\nhere's when we're actually\nmaking this report from instead.\n\n76\n00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.687\nAnd that way we can model that,\nas well as we take a look at.\n\n77\n00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:18.458\nSo once I have that locked in as\nfar as the current start date, or\n\n78\n00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.908\nthe current date.\n\n79\n00:04:19.908 --> 00:04:24.430\nWell, what I want to do then is\nI wanna update this one task.\n\n80\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.420\nWell, the easiest way to update a single\ntask is normally by the default update\n\n81\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.308\nwhich is what we call percentage complete.\n\n82\n00:04:31.308 --> 00:04:35.780\nIf I right-click on that task,\nI can go down to Information.\n\n83\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.840\nAnd, inside of that task information\ndialogue box, if I select the Advanced\n\n84\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.560\ntab, you can see where it talks\nabout an earned value method.\n\n85\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.226\nThe earned value method is actually\nthe idea here of a ratio of what was\n\n86\n00:04:51.226 --> 00:04:54.051\nscheduled versus what is now completed.\n\n87\n00:04:54.051 --> 00:04:56.800\nAnd that's why it shows up\nas a percentage completed.\n\n88\n00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.820\nNow you can also have a physical\npercent complete as well,\n\n89\n00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.620\nwhich shows up as work hours instead.\n\n90\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.520\nSo this one is actually doing it based\noff of durations when we take a look\n\n91\n00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.700\nat the task information.\n\n92\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.471\nSo even though I set that up, it doesn't\nlook like right here inside of this\n\n93\n00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:17.890\nparticular view that I\ncan actually see a lot.\n\n94\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.660\nBut notice I can update it if I wanted to.\n\n95\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.800\nSo right here on the General tab, you\ncan see where it says Percent complete.\n\n96\n00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.520\nSo if I wanted to I could say at this\npoint here on the three day task.\n\n97\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.060\nLet's say it's two days into it, and\nwhat I can do is I can scroll up and\n\n98\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.490\nit does it by 5% at a time.\n\n99\n00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.920\nI can say,\nlet's say it's 65% complete at this point.\n\n100\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.170\nI can go ahead and click OK.\n\n101\n00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.100\nAnd now when I take a look,\n\n102\n00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.390\nyou're like, Ronnie that's not\nactually fairly impressive.\n\n103\n00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.020\nAnd it really isn't that\nimpressive right now visually.\n\n104\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.070\nBut if I go to my scroll to task, I will\nbegin to see a visual difference here.\n\n105\n00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.660\nSo you can see right now, that as you\ntake a look at the Gant chart view,\n\n106\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.290\nyou can see of course the bar itself.\n\n107\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.120\nAnd then that little blue bar\ninside is actually what is now our\n\n108\n00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.980\nprogress line inside.\n\n109\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.870\nAnd we can see that just\nvisually right now.\n\n110\n00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.590\nIt tells us when it's actually started and\n\n111\n00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.040\nwhen it's actually supposed to be\ncompleted, which is through the 21st.\n\n112\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.530\nAnd then, if I hover over that\ntiny blue line I can see at this\n\n113\n00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.679\npoint it's 65% complete.\n\n114\n00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:25.340\nSo that's one way where we\ncan do that fairly quickly.\n\n115\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.634\nIf I wanted to be that detailed\nas far as the 60% complete.\n\n116\n00:06:28.634 --> 00:06:30.980\nNow I'm gonna change that number, instead.\n\n117\n00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.270\nLet me go back in and\njust get rid of that right now.\n\n118\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.720\nAnd show you another method\nthat you can also use, too.\n\n119\n00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.170\nUsually, if you're actually in a hurry,\nand\n\n120\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.860\nyou're just trying to get\nsome rough numbers in there.\n\n121\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.793\nNormally we actually start seeing that\nproject has some default numbers that we\n\n122\n00:06:48.793 --> 00:06:54.920\ncan use which is 0, 25%, 50%,\n75%, and 100% complete instead.\n\n123\n00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.776\nSo inside of Project 2013,\nif you're on the Task tab,\n\n124\n00:06:58.776 --> 00:07:04.730\nin the scheduling grouping, notice that\nthere are also these percentages up here.\n\n125\n00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.050\nAnd these are actually marking that\nearned value in this completion as well.\n\n126\n00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.520\nRemember that the blue bar that represents\nwhat is scheduled to work on that\n\n127\n00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.740\nparticular task.\n\n128\n00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.960\nSo for us on that three day example,\nit would be right here,\n\n129\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.260\nthat's the whole thing.\n\n130\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.160\nAnd then it's a ratio versus\nwhat has actually been completed\n\n131\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.630\nwhen you take a look.\n\n132\n00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.020\nSo all I have to do if I actually\nwanna use those is fairly simple.\n\n133\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.760\nI just select the task, and\n\n134\n00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.530\nthen I can come in here and say,\noh, I'm 50% complete on that task.\n\n135\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.064\nOr, and maybe 75% complete.\n\n136\n00:07:35.064 --> 00:07:37.560\nAnd notice that it\nactually adjusted it for\n\n137\n00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.480\nme in its progress over\nhere on the blue bar.\n\n138\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.869\nSo, I can go ahead and\nmake estimates like that if I need to and\n\n139\n00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:46.740\nthere's 100% complete if I wanted to or\n0%.\n\n140\n00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.916\nSo, fairly easily able to actually\nadjust the percent complete.\n\n141\n00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:54.166\nAnd you might be wondering,\n\n142\n00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:57.407\nwhy does it actually allow you to\nadjust it if you're actually updating?\n\n143\n00:07:57.407 --> 00:07:59.717\nWell, later on you may go back then,\nright?\n\n144\n00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:01.244\nMaybe it's a week later and\n\n145\n00:08:01.244 --> 00:08:06.290\nyou may actually go from the 50% all\nthe way to 100% as you get more updates.\n\n146\n00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.630\nSo, you're not really changing anything\nexcept you're actually updating now\n\n147\n00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.170\nthe progress of what's starting to happen.\n\n148\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.530\nAs we update that in the background,\nremember that what's happening with those\n\n149\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.560\nresources that are now actually\ngetting accrued, the cost, right?\n\n150\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.910\nSo over a period of time what's happening\nis that that money is now actually being\n\n151\n00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.010\nrelieved and it's updating our project\nplan in the background as well, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.570\nNow even though these are kind\nof the two fairly easy views for\n\n153\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.740\nus to get into if we haven't really\nworked with the project very often,\n\n154\n00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.340\nthese may be the views that we actually\ndo want to work with right then.\n\n155\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.310\nBut there's other views that we can\nactually use, and more powerful views\n\n156\n00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.440\nas we start updating the overall\nprogress of our project plan as well.\n\n157\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.660\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n158\n00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.370\nshow you some of those other\nones that we have available too.\n\n159\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.550\nObject is actually\nan incredibly faceted program,\n\n160\n00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.890\nin the very fact that it's supposed to\ntry and show you what you need to see\n\n161\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.330\nat any particular point in time\nwhen you're actually ready to go.\n\n162\n00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.180\nAnd so, even though I can do what we\nwere just doing right here, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.830\nI can do it one task at a time and\n\n164\n00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.570\nthat means I have to open up every\ntask and enter it in and do that.\n\n165\n00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.660\nWhat if there is actually a view or\na table that you and\n\n166\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.710\nI could use to be able to enter in, well\nmultiple pieces of information at one time\n\n167\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.320\nfor each task as well as for\nall the tasks that are available.\n\n168\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.860\nWell we have access to that as well.\n\n169\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.520\nSo when we take a look at that,\nright, being able to navigate around\n\n170\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.550\nprojects is a very important part of\nactually mastering project as well.\n\n171\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.900\nSo if you go up to view instead, and\n\n172\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.720\nwe're gonna change out of this\ndefault view that we see right here.\n\n173\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.890\nAnd what we're looking for\nis where it says, data.\n\n174\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.560\nHey, the grouping here that says\ndata under the view tab, and\n\n175\n00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.240\nthen we're gonna look for tables.\n\n176\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.400\nAnd when I click down on that table,\n\n177\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.050\nbecause I am actually now officially\ntracking my progress, notice\n\n178\n00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.250\nthat I have several different tables\nthat actually are in front of me here.\n\n179\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.650\nAnd of course I have the entry table\nwhich is what we have by default\n\n180\n00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.840\nWhat I'm really looking for\nhere is actually under tracking.\n\n181\n00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.580\nNow if I was comparing multiple baselines,\nI may also choose this variants view to\n\n182\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.920\nhelp me out as well, and\nalso the baseline table, too.\n\n183\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.765\nThere's another show on actually take\na look at multiple baselines at will.\n\n184\n00:10:24.765 --> 00:10:26.049\nWe'll get to that as well.\n\n185\n00:10:26.049 --> 00:10:29.370\nBut what I'm looking for\nhere is right here under tracking.\n\n186\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:36.160\nSo if I select tracking,\nthat now gives me this table right here.\n\n187\n00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.810\nThe table that we see in front of us,\ngives us so much information per task,\n\n188\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.250\nthat we want to go ahead and\nto begin to update.\n\n189\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:50.400\nNow it doesn't mean you actually have to\nfill out every single piece of this table.\n\n190\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.610\nWhat it means is you need to decide which\none you're actually going to fill out.\n\n191\n00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.090\nSo by default I already told you\n\n192\n00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.060\nthat project actually defaults\nto this percent complete.\n\n193\n00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.920\nThis current status of the task expresses\na percentage of the task duration that's\n\n194\n00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.150\nbeen completed.\n\n195\n00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.010\nSo Project's not really monitoring,\nlet's say, work hours.\n\n196\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.340\nNow, you and I may choose work\nhours to actually enter in, right.\n\n197\n00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.960\nSo if I have a two-day task,\nI know that's 16 hours,\n\n198\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.840\nright, over two days and I'm gonna be\nworking off that standard calendar.\n\n199\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.890\nIf I know that ten hours been done,\nwell, do I want to sit there and\n\n200\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.750\ngo okay so 16 is equal to 100% so\nif I do ten hours of that my\n\n201\n00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.590\npercentage of that would be I\ndon't have a clue at this point.\n\n202\n00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.550\nSo instead I might choose to\ninstead enter in things like what\n\n203\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.760\nwork hours if I wanted to Well\nwe can do that here as well.\n\n204\n00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.560\nSo, lets say, lets go ahead and\ntake an example here again.\n\n205\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.130\nSo lets say I'm a primus cable and\n\n206\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:48.440\nit's right here, we've got three days\nof remaining duration at this point.\n\n207\n00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.000\nAnd notice that theres an actual start\ndate and an actual finish date as well.\n\n208\n00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.790\nNow, some of this stuff is actually\ngoing to be filled in by project\n\n209\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:00.780\nas we start entering in some\ninformation and some of it wont, right.\n\n210\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.350\nSo, let's go ahead and\nsee what happens here.\n\n211\n00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.460\nLet's see that I actually know\nthat I I've actually got on these\n\n212\n00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.230\nthree days here, right?\n\n213\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.820\nAnd it says 72 hours, so I assigned a lot\nof different resources to this thing.\n\n214\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.380\nThat the actual work that\nwe've actually completed here,\n\n215\n00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.530\nlet's say it's somewhere around 50 hours.\n\n216\n00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:20.800\nOkay, notice that when I typed\nin 50 hours of actual work\n\n217\n00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.160\nthat's been done It shows me that\nat this point it went ahead and\n\n218\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.810\ncalculated for me the remaining\nduration on this task itself.\n\n219\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.950\nOh, sorry, it's right here.\n\n220\n00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:37.210\nThe remaining duration is\na little bit less than a day.\n\n221\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.560\nAnd what I've already done is\na little bit over two days.\n\n222\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.940\nYou can barely see it right\nhere on our monitor, but\n\n223\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.270\nremember that one project goes ahead and\nstarts calculating data out.\n\n224\n00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:55.040\nAnd it changes something in our view,\nwe're going to end up seeing that too.\n\n225\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.310\nSo here, by simply entering in the actual\nhours, 50 hours of work, right?\n\n226\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:05.110\nThey went ahead and they modified and\nthey said here's how much of a duration in\n\n227\n00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.580\nother words,\ndays that you've actually worked and\n\n228\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.700\nhere is the remaining duration that\nwe have available to us, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.320\nSo if it was a three day task it says\na little bit under three days or\n\n230\n00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.030\na day that I have left.\n\n231\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.180\nAnd then also I went ahead and\ncalculated my actual cost out for me so\n\n232\n00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.680\neven though there's a lot of columns\nhere don't be intimidated by it.\n\n233\n00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.940\nPick what it is that you know that's\ngonna update your project and\n\n234\n00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.820\nthen you'll actually be able to see all\nthe other information it can also fill in.\n\n235\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.880\nNotice the percentage\ncomplete came back in and\n\n236\n00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.670\ntold me what I was telling you right?\n\n237\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.550\nIf I knew that there was just so much of\npercentage here and I knew work hours.\n\n238\n00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.550\nBut under this percentage complete, that\ncalculates by duration over three days,\n\n239\n00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:53.300\nI had no clue what 50 hours actually\nequalled in terms of percentage.\n\n240\n00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.730\nSo I could have been close,\nI could have just said it was 60%, and\n\n241\n00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.390\nit could have actually worked.\n\n242\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.500\nBut now by entering in those work hours\nI can also see the other information.\n\n243\n00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.980\nNow you might be wondering\nwhy is that important.\n\n244\n00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.210\nBecause it gives me now the ability\nto say if Don comes and\n\n245\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:14.260\nasks me, well how far along are we\nin installing that premise cable in.\n\n246\n00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.700\nWell, I can tell them, it looks like that\nwe have a little bit less than a day.\n\n247\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.240\nI could even go ahead and say, maybe in\na few more hours and we should be done.\n\n248\n00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.800\nSo it actually does give you\na lot of useful information\n\n249\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.220\nthat you can go ahead and\nstart working on as well.\n\n250\n00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.660\nNow notice that it went ahead and also\nstarted on the 20th, and that's because we\n\n251\n00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:38.740\ndidn't actually calculate out a new date\nor anything else that we also had too.\n\n252\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.870\nSo it defaulted to the date that we\noriginally had assigned to that task,\n\n253\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.000\nwhen the project plan was actually, went\nahead and was auto scheduled to do that.\n\n254\n00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.450\nNow if I wanted to, I could actually\nchange just even the start date itself.\n\n255\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.860\nSo notice it says the actual start date.\n\n256\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.410\nThere's sometimes where the scheduling\ndoesn't work out exactly like you thought\n\n257\n00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.870\nit was going to and now you're trying to\nfigure out whether you're behind or not.\n\n258\n00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:06.570\nWell notice that if I select actual\nstart here let me hover over that again.\n\n259\n00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.910\nDay and time that a task has been,\nor an assignment has actually begin,\n\n260\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.700\nbased on the progress\ninformation you've entered.\n\n261\n00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.160\nSo here, if I go ahead and say hey look,\n\n262\n00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.180\nit didn't actually get\nto start on the 20th,\n\n263\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.010\ninstead it actually ended up starting\non let's say, on the 24th instead.\n\n264\n00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.180\nWell now that I have that task,\nthen I can go ahead and\n\n265\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.350\nit says remaining duration cuz\nwe estimated it at one day.\n\n266\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:35.910\nLet's say that I thought that 12\nhours of that task has been done.\n\n267\n00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.180\nNotice that when I do that,\nit is not actually letting me\n\n268\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.460\nsee that if I started late here is\nwhat date it's expected to be on.\n\n269\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.869\nAnd at this point it should be actually\ncomplete, and it went to one and\n\n270\n00:15:47.869 --> 00:15:49.228\na half days instead.\n\n271\n00:15:49.228 --> 00:15:53.178\nSo, we can see that from doing something\nlike that we can tell how much work is\n\n272\n00:15:53.178 --> 00:15:54.061\nleft to be done.\n\n273\n00:15:54.061 --> 00:15:59.010\nWe can also tell how much work that\nwe actually have completed as well.\n\n274\n00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.820\nAnd then see whether or\nnot we're actually on schedule.\n\n275\n00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.560\nSo, by being able to update our progress,\nright, throughout our project plan,\n\n276\n00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.160\nwe're starting to see\ninformation like that come in.\n\n277\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.190\nLet me go back over here to\nthe Gantt chart view just a moment.\n\n278\n00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.340\nI don't have to actually even do that,\nI can just use the bar over here,\n\n279\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.850\nthe dividing bar.\n\n280\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.700\nAnd you can now see that those same\nprogress lines are now actually also\n\n281\n00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.890\nfilling in here, and so\nwe have a visual reminder that\n\n282\n00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:29.762\nprogress is now beginning to happen and\nbeginning to work as well.\n\n283\n00:16:29.762 --> 00:16:33.185\nNow, that's also important to understand\nsome of the different situations that go\n\n284\n00:16:33.185 --> 00:16:36.385\non when we are also\nupdating our progress too.\n\n285\n00:16:36.385 --> 00:16:42.865\nLet's take for an example here, let me go\nback over here to the Gantt chart view for\n\n286\n00:16:42.865 --> 00:16:46.410\njust a moment so I can see a few things.\n\n287\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.350\nOops, have to change my table view.\n\n288\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.600\nBack over to the entry table for a moment.\n\n289\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.450\nI need to actually take\na look at this duration here.\n\n290\n00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:59.970\nSo, let's say that under the Installing\nthe Cubicles, right, we have it actually\n\n291\n00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:06.090\ngoing ahead at this point, and there's\na constrain on it because the cubical\n\n292\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:10.930\ninstaller could not actually get there\nuntil, well, the first of September.\n\n293\n00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.505\nAnd I can tell that there's constraint,\nbecause on line 20,\n\n294\n00:17:14.505 --> 00:17:17.164\nI can hover over the indicators column and\nsee.\n\n295\n00:17:17.164 --> 00:17:23.894\nDoes this task have a start note\nearlier than constraint on the 9/1.\n\n296\n00:17:23.894 --> 00:17:26.441\nSo I can see that, and\nyou can actually see why.\n\n297\n00:17:26.441 --> 00:17:30.610\nIt says that the cubicles actually aren't\ngonna actually be delivered until, well,\n\n298\n00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.666\nthe first of September, so there's no use\nin actually having the cubicle installer\n\n299\n00:17:34.666 --> 00:17:36.580\ncome in before that point.\n\n300\n00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.300\nSo by having that information there,\nwe're ready to go.\n\n301\n00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.450\nNow, what if we actually had something\nlike this where all of a sudden,\n\n302\n00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:49.040\nwe were in the middle of working\non that particular task, and\n\n303\n00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.300\nwe actually did get about half of it done,\non that task?\n\n304\n00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.830\nSo let's say it's 50% complete,\nand I've just went ahead and\n\n305\n00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.660\nmarked it as being 50% complete here.\n\n306\n00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:04.070\nLet me scroll to the task so that we can\nsee that over in our Gantt chart as well.\n\n307\n00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.065\nSo, it's marked as 50% complete, and\nhere is the cubicle installation.\n\n308\n00:18:08.065 --> 00:18:11.100\nBut then what happened is, let's say,\n\n309\n00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.170\nsome type of emergency,\none of the cubicles drop or\n\n310\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:20.470\nsome other workplace emergency, and\nthey were not able to get back in,\n\n311\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.750\nokay, to be able to help us do what we\nneeded to, let's say for another day.\n\n312\n00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.330\nWell, when something like happens, right,\n\n313\n00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:32.710\nit could actually delay our overall\nprogress in our project plan.\n\n314\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:33.940\nBut what do I do?\n\n315\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.310\nDo I just keep extending the work out?\n\n316\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:41.160\nIn other words, this turns not into a two\nday task, but now it's three days and\n\n317\n00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.250\nI just keep bumping up\nthat duration number.\n\n318\n00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.370\nFour days may now go by because he\nhasn't come back in a couple of days.\n\n319\n00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.030\nSo, I could do that.\n\n320\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.620\nI could actually say,\nhe wasn't able to be here on Tuesday,\n\n321\n00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.370\nmaybe he'll make it on Wednesday, but now\nthat makes it a three day task cuz there's\n\n322\n00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.890\none day that he's not working, or\nfour days, whatever it might be.\n\n323\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.830\nWell, that's one way to do it, but\nif we're doing something like that,\n\n324\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.775\nwe're actually not showing\nwhat needs to really happen.\n\n325\n00:19:06.775 --> 00:19:10.820\n50% of the work was done on one day,\nbut, really,\n\n326\n00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.791\nthe other half of the work really\njust needs to be rescheduled, right.\n\n327\n00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:17.970\nAnd so that's what we also want\nto take a look at as well.\n\n328\n00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.520\nSo, let's say that this task has remained\nthis way, about 50 percent undone, and\n\n329\n00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.240\nnow we've got the cubicle installer\nbeing able to come back in and\n\n330\n00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.015\ndo the rest of the work.\n\n331\n00:19:26.015 --> 00:19:32.120\nWell, if I select task number 20,\nor actually 3.5,\n\n332\n00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:37.490\nthen I can go up here to the task tab and\nunder Schedule,\n\n333\n00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:41.966\ninside of that grouping you actually see\nan icon here that says,mark on track, and\n\n334\n00:19:41.966 --> 00:19:48.890\nthen, to the right of it, a little drop\ndown, and then I can select Update Task 2.\n\n335\n00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.500\nNow, it's here that we can actually\nstart to see the remaining durations and\n\n336\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.750\nsome of the other stuff\nthat we can also see.\n\n337\n00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.700\nNow, I need to reschedule the work, right?\n\n338\n00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.990\nIf that resource can't come in,\nand I just extend out that task,\n\n339\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.490\nI'm gonna be paying for\nsomething that's not actually occurring.\n\n340\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.840\nSo, in rescheduling work,\nlet me show you how that's done.\n\n341\n00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.850\nI'm gonna select Installing Cubicles.\n\n342\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.950\nAnd once I select that, up here on\nthe top, I'm gonna select Project.\n\n343\n00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.350\nAnd once I select Project, I'm looking for\n\n344\n00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:20.960\nthe status grouping here, and\nthen selecting Update Project.\n\n345\n00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.390\nIf I select Update Project there,\n\n346\n00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:28.090\nnotice it gives me the option\nto reschedule uncompleted work.\n\n347\n00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:33.945\nSo if I know that that work is not going\nto be completed by Wednesday the 2nd,\n\n348\n00:20:33.945 --> 00:20:36.840\nright, I can then select\nthe Reschedule the Task.\n\n349\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.280\nAnd then, I come over here and\nI change my calendar.\n\n350\n00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.240\nAnd instead of it actually completing\non the 2nd, let's say that what\n\n351\n00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.540\nends up happening is that he says that\nhe's gonna come back in on the, well,\n\n352\n00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:56.050\nlet's say the fourth here, on Friday\nthe fourth, to finish that as well.\n\n353\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.460\nNow I don't want to actually go ahead and\ndo this for the entire project.\n\n354\n00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.580\nI can if I want to, right, and\n\n355\n00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.610\nthat would go ahead and\npush down all the other information.\n\n356\n00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.850\nIf I wanna do it just for\nthe selected task, I can do that.\n\n357\n00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.680\nBut for right now, that's all I wanna do.\n\n358\n00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.360\nI don't actually have any of the other\nwork that's actually been unscheduled.\n\n359\n00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.790\nAnd so you do wanna be careful,\nright, if you are updating\n\n360\n00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.510\nall your tasks at the same time, and you\ndo have tasks that are actually finishing,\n\n361\n00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.069\nand they're just updating,\nthey're not completely finished, right,\n\n362\n00:21:25.069 --> 00:21:28.720\nwhat could happen is when I actually\nselect for the entire project,\n\n363\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.220\nthat takes every one of those tasks\nthat we're actually updating and\n\n364\n00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.230\nactually goes ahead and\nmoves them to that date.\n\n365\n00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:39.210\nSo instead, make sure I've selected\non a proper task and click OK, and\n\n366\n00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:44.590\nwhen I do that, you can now see,\nvisually, actually you can't see it,\n\n367\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:48.520\nlet me see if I can move that over\na little bit more so that we can see this.\n\n368\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:54.210\nOver here on task number 19, you can see\nwhere part of the work was actually done,\n\n369\n00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.610\nhere, which is what we\nwanted to account for.\n\n370\n00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:00.530\nAnd then instead of actually paying for\nall this time in the middle by extending\n\n371\n00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:05.700\nout the duration of that task,\ninstead we reschedule the other\n\n372\n00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:10.770\npart of that work to be done over here,\nlet's say on the eighth instead.\n\n373\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.440\nSo, it's something that you actually do,\nand\n\n374\n00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.550\nyou can actually account for\nwhen things happen, right?\n\n375\n00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.480\nWork does get interrupted plenty of times,\nand you just have to actually\n\n376\n00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.830\nbe able account for it instead of just\ngoing, oh, let me extend that task out.\n\n377\n00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.870\nAnd that begins to blow your budget\na little bit more out of water as well.\n\n378\n00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:32.390\nSo there are multiple things that\nwe can actually do to update our\n\n379\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.160\nprogress here, too.\n\n380\n00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.950\nNow, we've got a little bit of time here,\nwe also wanna go ahead and take a look at\n\n381\n00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:42.070\njust a couple of other options that\nare also available to us too, okay.\n\n382\n00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.910\nSo if I go back to Project Information,\nnotice that I also\n\n383\n00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.950\ncan change the status date as well.\n\n384\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:58.500\nIf you know that your project's gonna\nbe happening over a series of time and\n\n385\n00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.790\nevents, months, weeks, years,\nwhatever it might be, you might go ahead\n\n386\n00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.940\nevery week and set up when you actually\nwant this status update to happen.\n\n387\n00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.380\nSo that way, it will actually go ahead and\nbegin to track that too, about when you\n\n388\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.200\nwanna set the next status date up so that\nyou can update your progress plan as well.\n\n389\n00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.210\nAnd so that gives you that ability to\nhave a little reminder there that, hey,\n\n390\n00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.500\nit's time for a status update.\n\n391\n00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.280\nAnd when you're actually doing this for\nan individual task, this is doing it for\n\n392\n00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.700\nthe overall project.\n\n393\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.420\nThat way you know that you're checking\nin with all the people that's working on\n\n394\n00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.710\nyour project, and\nbe able to get the update.\n\n395\n00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.200\nSo you might choose to set that up for\n\n396\n00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.310\nthe, well,\nlet's say it's the 31st here as well, and\n\n397\n00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.870\nthat way you know that a new project\nstatus date is also coming up soon.\n\n398\n00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:44.460\nAnd so, once you do that, you can\nactually select that date, no big deal.\n\n399\n00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.730\nIt gives you now a reminder\na little bit later on\n\n400\n00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.650\nthat you will also have an update\nthat's also coming up for you, too.\n\n401\n00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.290\nSo that's what you're also able to do.\n\n402\n00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:58.200\nSo there's a lot of different ways\nthat you and I can take a single task,\n\n403\n00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.260\nas well as the entire project,\nand begin to update those tasks.\n\n404\n00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.580\nTaking a look at some of the different\nviews that you have available to you\n\n405\n00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.190\nunder the tables, especially using\nthat tracking table, is another one.\n\n406\n00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.070\nRemember, you don't have to fill\nin every thing that you have.\n\n407\n00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.900\nYou really just need a couple\nof pieces of information, and\n\n408\n00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.880\nwatch what ends up happening.\n\n409\n00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.970\nMost of us probably are not gonna\ndo it by the percentage complete.\n\n410\n00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.830\nMost of us,\nwe're actually managing it, right?\n\n411\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:28.100\nWe're actually saying, how many hours did\nyou spend, Ronnie, working on a task?\n\n412\n00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.830\nAnd then we can put that in there, and\nthe rest of it will begin to fill in for\n\n413\n00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.630\nus if we need to.\n\n414\n00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.140\nSo there's a lot of ways\nthat you can use Project to\n\n415\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.515\nreally help you to begin to track\nthe way that your progress is going.\n\n416\n00:24:41.515 --> 00:24:46.845\nAnd from there, you can now actually see\nthat progress is starting to happen,\n\n417\n00:24:46.845 --> 00:24:49.325\nand you can start seeing where\nyou're falling behind or\n\n418\n00:24:49.325 --> 00:24:52.445\nyour schedule or\nyou're spending too much money already or\n\n419\n00:24:52.445 --> 00:24:56.440\nwhere you actually may actually be able\nto add in additional resources as well.\n\n420\n00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.730\nThat's all that we have for\nMicrosoft Project today.\n\n421\n00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.180\nThank you for joining us.\n\n422\n00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.482\nI'm Ronnie Wong signing off for

--> 00:00:17.150\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we'll be taking a look at\n\n4\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.800\nMicrosoft Project,\nspecifically with working with variances.\n\n5\n00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.030\nSo when we take a look at variances\nin our Microsoft project plan,\n\n6\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.250\nwhat we want to be able to do, of course,\nis be able to see where our progress\n\n7\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.220\ninside of our project plan is beginning\nto diverge from the original base line.\n\n8\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.400\nWhen you take a base line\ninside of Microsoft Project,\n\n9\n00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.470\nit normally happens after you get all\nthe information entered in that you want\n\n10\n00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.820\nthe task you're actually going to work on,\n\n11\n00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.400\nthe resources you need to work on those\ntasks, as well as their material or\n\n12\n00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.700\nthey're work related or they're cost\nresources and then we want to assign them.\n\n13\n00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.230\nTaking a task and assigning resources\nto it is going to begin to show us\n\n14\n00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.190\nhow much each task is going to cost and\nhow long it may take for\n\n15\n00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.850\nthat task to finish and complete as well.\n\n16\n00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.630\nWell, once we have everything in place and\n\n17\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.950\nwe believe that is our perfect project\nplan, as close as we're going to get to\n\n18\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.060\nperfection, then what we're going\nto do is take that baseline.\n\n19\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.520\nA baseline is essentially a snapshot\nof the entire project plan.\n\n20\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.630\nIt normally helps us to ensure that we\ncan historically keep track of the finish\n\n21\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.980\ndate, as well as the start date\ninside of Microsoft Project,\n\n22\n00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.780\nit keeps track of work information for us.\n\n23\n00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.760\nIt keeps track of resource information,\ntask information as well, so\n\n24\n00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.980\nthat if we ever need to, we can then\ntake all those pieces of information and\n\n25\n00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.390\nuse them to build and compare against,\nand that way we can know whether or\n\n26\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.200\nnot our current project plan is actually\n\n27\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.400\non schedule in the way that we think that\nit is based on time as well as on cost.\n\n28\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.580\nOr whether we're beginning to\nslip behind in those tasks too.\n\n29\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.340\nSo that is what we want to start off with\nwhen we take a look at actually trying to\n\n30\n00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.670\nwork with variances.\n\n31\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.445\nVariances allow us then to see\nwhen we are actually moving away\n\n32\n00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:06.035\nfrom that original baseline, and that\nhappens over time, as well as account for\n\n33\n00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:09.885\nthings we just can't account for\nat the time we took the original baseline.\n\n34\n00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:12.565\nSo that's where everything\nreally does begin for us.\n\n35\n00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.195\nAnd we want to be able to mark that and\n\n36\n00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:17.835\nunderstand that it didn't happen\ninside the original project plan, but\n\n37\n00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:21.625\nas we started seeing more progress, that\nwe are able to see and keep track of those\n\n38\n00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:25.910\nchanges, know when they happen and even\nhow much they're gonna end up costing.\n\n39\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.370\nSo let's show you how to do that\ninside of Microsoft Project.\n\n40\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.100\nSo when we take a look at Microsoft\nProject, let's go ahead and kind of give\n\n41\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.790\nan example of some of the different things\nthat we're going to go ahead and do.\n\n42\n00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.690\nSo let's say that this project plan is\njust about complete and everything that we\n\n43\n00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.540\nactually need, but there is just a couple\nof things that I have left to do.\n\n44\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.480\nSo, let me go down here to task 3.1,\nuninstalling premise cabling.\n\n45\n00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.520\nAnd if I go ahead and\ntake a look at that one task,\n\n46\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.600\nyou can see that I've added in some\nresources, but I forgot to add in\n\n47\n00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.780\nsome of the important things like\nthe material resource, such as my cabling.\n\n48\n00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.020\nSo if I click on that drop down I can\nselect plenum cable to run inside,\n\n49\n00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.560\nof course, the walls and\nthe false ceilings here.\n\n50\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.660\nAnd let's say that I believe it's\ngonna actually take about 750 feet\n\n51\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.720\nof that cabling to be able to do that,\nand so I'll go ahead and click okay.\n\n52\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.110\nSo if now I'm just about complete and I\nbelieve that now my project plan is ready\n\n53\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.570\nto proceed forward, I'm gonna use this now\nto track and to start managing my project.\n\n54\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.500\nI want to click on project and\nthen, under the schedule grouping,\n\n55\n00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.650\nI want to select Set Baseline.\n\n56\n00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.510\nWhen I click on Set Baseline,\n\n57\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.960\nnow it's gonna save all that project\nplan information for me as a snapshot.\n\n58\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.070\nIt's just like looking back on a regular\nsnapshot that you're comparing now,\n\n59\n00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.530\nwhat's gonna happen from this point\non to that original snapshot.\n\n60\n00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.470\nRemember that Project actually allows you\nto take up to 11 different baselines.\n\n61\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.580\nAnd if you wanna take a look at setting\nup those different baselines, we do have\n\n62\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.480\nanother complete episode there that\nyou can take a look on how to do that.\n\n63\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.740\nBut it's fairly simple,\nyou see it's just a couple of clicks and\n\n64\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.270\nyou're now ready to go.\n\n65\n00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.340\nSo now my project plan is ready.\n\n66\n00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.360\nIf I click on project information and\nI select statistics, the way I know that\n\n67\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.600\nI've actually got a baseline stored is\nright here in the second row as you see.\n\n68\n00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.560\nWhere it says baseline,\n\n69\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.040\nyou actually see both of those\nrows has the word baseline in it.\n\n70\n00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.500\nIf I had not yet set a base line,\n\n71\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.530\nyou'd probably see N/A in each of these\ncolumns in the row that says base line.\n\n72\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.910\nAnd, notice that the actual cost\nessentially are identical and\n\n73\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.380\nthat's because I just took that and it's\nactually compared against the current.\n\n74\n00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.700\nCurrent is now actually saying, hey,\nthis is what I'm ready to do and\n\n75\n00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.630\nit'll actually begin to adjust.\n\n76\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.970\nWhereas the baseline costs probably\nwill not actually adjust for us.\n\n77\n00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.240\nSo just kinda remember that that's where\nyou actually see if you actually have\n\n78\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.660\ncorrectly set a baseline for you.\n\n79\n00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.160\nSo as we start now to track and\nmonitor progress, what we\n\n80\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.280\nshould see in this box then is that\nthat current line will begin to change.\n\n81\n00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.810\nWhether it's in duration or the amount of\nwork, or the cost, that's the number that\n\n82\n00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.410\nshould change whereas the original\nbaseline cost should not.\n\n83\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.525\nAnd you'll see also actual\nstart to change as well.\n\n84\n00:05:07.525 --> 00:05:09.920\nSo let me show you an example\nof what we're talking about and\n\n85\n00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.828\nthen we'll come back to this and see it.\n\n86\n00:05:11.828 --> 00:05:15.050\nSo I'm gonna remain on this\ntask to kind of show an example\n\n87\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.200\nof what can begin to happen.\n\n88\n00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.310\nSo right now on task 3.1, I have\nsingle task that lasts three days, and\n\n89\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.010\nI've got 72 hours of work scheduled.\n\n90\n00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.210\nYou're probably like why\nis it 72 hours of work?\n\n91\n00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.810\nWell, I've got a few different\nresources assigned here, right?\n\n92\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.365\nI've got the infrastructure tech, the\nsupport tech, and the network technician\n\n93\n00:05:33.365 --> 00:05:36.625\nrunning these cables to be able\nto do stuff like this, right?\n\n94\n00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:38.575\nSo when you add them up over three days,\n\n95\n00:05:38.575 --> 00:05:41.375\neach one of them is essentially\nan eight hour day, right?\n\n96\n00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:43.935\nSo they'll actually add\nin 24 hours times three.\n\n97\n00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:45.475\nThat's where you get those 72 hours.\n\n98\n00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:47.133\nNow that's unrealistic, but\n\n99\n00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:50.520\njust bear with me in this example\nas you take a look at it, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.464\nSo we have those resources that\nare actually there and available to us.\n\n101\n00:05:54.464 --> 00:06:00.003\nAnd let's say that they finish\nthat task on time and on schedule.\n\n102\n00:06:00.003 --> 00:06:04.728\nSo I'm going to click on task and I'm just\ngoing to mark it as being 100% complete.\n\n103\n00:06:04.728 --> 00:06:09.035\nNow, when I select that, let me go back\nto Project and Project Information for\n\n104\n00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.500\na moment and click on Statistics.\n\n105\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.850\nAnd now you can start seeing\na couple of different things.\n\n106\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.440\nNow I could have marked a little bit more,\nbut\n\n107\n00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.060\nwhat we're looking at here is\nactually the actual line as well.\n\n108\n00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.140\nSo as I begin to start to do stuff,\nso we're actually now\n\n109\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.290\nentering in progress information,\nthe actual line will begin to fill in.\n\n110\n00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.220\nAnd you can see, there it is,\nit took 1.7 days, 72 hours of work.\n\n111\n00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.670\nHere is the overall cost that we had\n\n112\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.785\nin everything is based on\nour perfect calculation.\n\n113\n00:06:40.785 --> 00:06:46.910\n100% everything that has gone there\nincluding the amount of material we spent.\n\n114\n00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.850\nRight click and go on task information and\nthen I select resources here.\n\n115\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.090\nNotice there is 750 feet and\nit cost me an additional $82.50.\n\n116\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.480\nPerfectly fine, we are more than happy\nto actually account for that, okay.\n\n117\n00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.890\nSo once we've got that done, that should\nbe it, we should be fine and ready to go.\n\n118\n00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.790\nBut let's say that what\nwe actually get now\n\n119\n00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.710\nis that now that we've entered in that\nit's actually completed, somebody said,\n\n120\n00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.810\nhey it's all done,\nthen they come back and go, oh,\n\n121\n00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.530\nby the way, we used a lot more cable\nthan we thought we were going to use.\n\n122\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.520\nSo, we need to also account for that.\n\n123\n00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.640\nSo all I have to do to do that is\nI can right-click on that task and\n\n124\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.510\ngo to information, and\n\n125\n00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.910\nin that same place where it says\nresources, I can simply update this.\n\n126\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.300\nSo of course I say, hey,\nhow much more did we use?\n\n127\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.500\nWell we used about let's\nsay 825 feet instead.\n\n128\n00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.280\nI go ahead and click okay and\nnow it's been updated.\n\n129\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.170\nOkay, so now that that's\nactually been updated here,\n\n130\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.980\nlet's see if that makes any change inside\nour project information in statistics.\n\n131\n00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.980\nAnd now you can start to see it actually\nadded in a little bit more money.\n\n132\n00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.877\nBut overall though, everything is fine.\n\n133\n00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:02.813\nNotice did not change the overall duration\nand the variance that we're tracking here,\n\n134\n00:08:02.813 --> 00:08:06.627\nbut it did actually vary my project Right,\nI could've added it in.\n\n135\n00:08:06.627 --> 00:08:10.602\nAnd if I actually accounted for\nit right then and there and I don't\n\n136\n00:08:10.602 --> 00:08:15.442\ndo anything else, I don't know if at the\nvery beginning if you were to go back and\n\n137\n00:08:15.442 --> 00:08:20.900\nask me about task 3.1, well, how much did\nwe spend and when did it actually occur?\n\n138\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.910\nWell, I can tell you\nthat we used 825 feet.\n\n139\n00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.860\nBut if I didn't know what the original\nfootage was that I assigned for it, well\n\n140\n00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.330\nnow I just kind of assume that this is\nthe way it's been from the very beginning.\n\n141\n00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.804\nI might be able to check the Notes tab,\nand I might have actually put in\n\n142\n00:08:35.804 --> 00:08:40.434\na note here that said originally on\nthe baseline it was 750 feet, and\n\n143\n00:08:40.434 --> 00:08:42.842\nnow it's 825 feet if I wanted to.\n\n144\n00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:45.633\nAnd that might be something that's there,\nbut it may not.\n\n145\n00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:48.125\nOr I could do it while I'm\nactually updating, right?\n\n146\n00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:51.378\nIf I'm updating it right now,\nI might say something like that.\n\n147\n00:08:51.378 --> 00:08:57.442\nThat the original was 750 feet and now\nthe update is 825 feet, so let's do that.\n\n148\n00:08:57.442 --> 00:09:02.850\nSo let's say that originally\n\n149\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:09.771\nwe had 750 feet of cable assigned,\n\n150\n00:09:09.771 --> 00:09:13.895\nbut used 825 feet.\n\n151\n00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:17.238\nSo that way I get a little note and\na graphic that's actually going to\n\n152\n00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:19.996\nbe produced out here to\nthe left-hand side on row 14,\n\n153\n00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:23.770\nthat will then show me just a little bit\nof the information of what happened.\n\n154\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.030\nAnd that's one way that we can do that,\nand that will start to work.\n\n155\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.896\nBut another way is allowing Project to\ndynamically show me where things actually\n\n156\n00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:33.120\nstarted to happen.\n\n157\n00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.400\nAnd all of these things\nare what we call variances.\n\n158\n00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.600\nAnd they're essentially differentiations\nfrom the baseline itself.\n\n159\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.750\nSo what we need to do, is we need to now\ntake this information and be able to\n\n160\n00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.710\nview it differently so that we can track\nthose different variances instead.\n\n161\n00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.170\nSo I'm gonna click on View, and\nthis time I'm gonna change our view.\n\n162\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.560\nEverything that we're doing right\nnow is actually a task orientation.\n\n163\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.370\nWe're seeing, by that one task, how much\nthe duration is, the work, the start and\n\n164\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.468\nthe finish dates, and\nthe resources assigned.\n\n165\n00:10:03.468 --> 00:10:07.390\nWell I'm gonna change that around and\nactually view things by the resource and\n\n166\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.650\nsee the other information instead.\n\n167\n00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.170\nThe way to do that is under View,\n\n168\n00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.390\nunder the Resource views,\nI'm gonna now select Resource Usage.\n\n169\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:22.397\nAnd when I select Resource Usage,\nthen I can now scroll down,\n\n170\n00:10:22.397 --> 00:10:27.351\nand I can now look for\nmy Category 5 plenum cabling.\n\n171\n00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:30.907\nAnd it can show me that what I've\nactually used on the project so far, oop,\n\n172\n00:10:30.907 --> 00:10:33.284\nI kinda stretch that out\na little bit too far here.\n\n173\n00:10:33.284 --> 00:10:36.657\nLet me kinda collapse that back down,\nwell maybe.\n\n174\n00:10:36.657 --> 00:10:38.630\nAll right, let me try and\ndo that different, there we go.\n\n175\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.860\nLet me go back down\nhere to plenum cabling.\n\n176\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.625\n825 feet has actually been used, okay.\n\n177\n00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:47.290\nBut was was originally set there?\n\n178\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.900\nWell if I go back to\nthe add in a new column,\n\n179\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.730\nI'm gonna type in baseline work instead.\n\n180\n00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.570\nAnd when I add that in there,\nI can start seeing that the original,\n\n181\n00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.970\nat some point here,\nactually was 1,575 feet.\n\n182\n00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:08.575\nBut notice for\nthis one task though, it was,\n\n183\n00:11:08.575 --> 00:11:14.840\nwell, 750 feet was the original baseline\nthat I had actually set in there.\n\n184\n00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.768\nSo somewhere along the line,\nwhen the baseline was set and\n\n185\n00:11:17.768 --> 00:11:20.719\nI assumed we were gonna use 750 feet,\nperfectly fine.\n\n186\n00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:24.689\nBut then I find out that\nI really used 825 feet.\n\n187\n00:11:24.689 --> 00:11:28.030\nIf I wanna go a little bit further,\nI can also go ahead and\n\n188\n00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:33.570\nadd in a new column here and type in work,\nand then I'm looking for work variance.\n\n189\n00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.970\nAnd that will actually go ahead and\nalso allow me to see, there it is,\n\n190\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.130\nthe extra 75 feet is what I\nended up using as a variance.\n\n191\n00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.920\nNow don't get me wrong, I could\nprobably do the math simply enough.\n\n192\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.270\nBut sometimes these numbers get big and\nthey get a little bit more complicated.\n\n193\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.471\nI'd rather Project for it to go ahead and\n\n194\n00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:52.464\ndo it because it is doing it\nin the background already.\n\n195\n00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:53.834\nIt's not actually saying, hey,\n\n196\n00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:56.245\nthis is the first time I've\ncome up with this calculation.\n\n197\n00:11:56.245 --> 00:12:01.045\nIt already is doing it in the background\nand calculating for me so\n\n198\n00:12:01.045 --> 00:12:02.885\nthat it can actually do that.\n\n199\n00:12:02.885 --> 00:12:06.955\nSo it is showing that up for\nus to be able to actually be tracked.\n\n200\n00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:09.245\nThings like work variances as well.\n\n201\n00:12:09.245 --> 00:12:13.985\nNow of course, with a work variance,\nwe also then understand that we spent\n\n202\n00:12:13.985 --> 00:12:18.820\na little bit more money on\nthis one task as well too.\n\n203\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.370\nSo, we can change our view again.\n\n204\n00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.340\nAnd some of the other thing that we\ncan do is view things by their cost.\n\n205\n00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.430\nSo now under the View tab and\n\n206\n00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.400\nunder the data grouping, if I select\nTables, I can also select Cost here.\n\n207\n00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.090\nAnd it is here that I can view\nmy variance in my cost as well.\n\n208\n00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.840\nSo, currently,\nbecause I used 825 feet of cable,\n\n209\n00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.925\nit did cost the project for\nthat task about $90.75.\n\n210\n00:12:47.925 --> 00:12:53.712\nOriginally the baseline itself was $82.50,\nperfectly fine.\n\n211\n00:12:53.712 --> 00:12:58.212\nAnd then you can see the variance here\ntoo, is that it actually just cost me\n\n212\n00:12:58.212 --> 00:13:03.460\na little bit under $10 to add in that\nadditional 75 feet that I added in.\n\n213\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.120\nSo, it's not that it can't be done, right?\n\n214\n00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.820\nEven with the simple figures I had,\nI could probably work this out.\n\n215\n00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.166\nActually, knowing me, I probably could\nnot have worked it out in my head.\n\n216\n00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:15.870\nWith $8.25,\nI probably am not gonna worry about it.\n\n217\n00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.562\nBut if I looked at this and I saw that\nnumber and it was now, let's say, $300,\n\n218\n00:13:20.562 --> 00:13:24.680\nI might begin to wonder and go,\nwhoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.\n\n219\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.420\nWhat is it that you did that ended up\nmaking this cost a little bit more\n\n220\n00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.683\nthan you thought?\n\n221\n00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:33.170\nSo this is the perfect time as a project\nmanager that you go back in and\n\n222\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.675\nsay, what did you do that you\nneeded an extra 75 feet of cable?\n\n223\n00:13:36.675 --> 00:13:39.120\nAnd you start asking questions about that.\n\n224\n00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.760\nAnd then you try and\nfigure where that actually went.\n\n225\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.580\nAnd so\nthe nice thing is Project can show you.\n\n226\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.740\nWhether it's a cost variance, whether\nit's a work variance, it's right here.\n\n227\n00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.745\nAnd that's kind of a neat feature for us\nto be able to see right away, especially\n\n228\n00:13:53.745 --> 00:13:57.125\nif we're tracking things like, well, like\nwhat we talk about here, work and cost.\n\n229\n00:13:57.125 --> 00:13:59.905\nThese are kind of the two\nmain things that we do track.\n\n230\n00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.695\nNow, two of the three I should say.\n\n231\n00:14:01.695 --> 00:14:07.115\nThe third one is normally, of course,\nthe overall project duration itself too.\n\n232\n00:14:07.115 --> 00:14:09.855\nSo, let's also take a look at what happens\n\n233\n00:14:09.855 --> 00:14:14.860\nwhen we start actually influencing the\noverall duration of a task itself as well.\n\n234\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.270\nSo if I click on Task and\nthen I go back to my Gantt chart,\n\n235\n00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.640\nthis is kind of default view that we\nwere working with at the beginning.\n\n236\n00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.309\nWell, we're gonna move down to another\ntask that we have on hand to see\n\n237\n00:14:25.309 --> 00:14:27.040\nsomething else.\n\n238\n00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.810\nSo, let's take a look at installing\ncubicles here on 3.5, Installing cubicles.\n\n239\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:37.334\nNotice its a 2 day task and\nI also can tell over here on row 18 that\n\n240\n00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:41.719\nI've got a constraint,\nit says start no earlier than 9/1.\n\n241\n00:14:41.719 --> 00:14:45.282\nAnd it gives me a note and it says the\nreason why is that the cubicle hardware is\n\n242\n00:14:45.282 --> 00:14:49.910\nprobably not gonna be delivered into 9/1,\nso you can't even start on that day.\n\n243\n00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.198\nSo at that point we can see some other\nthings that's actually been assigned to\n\n244\n00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:54.830\nthe project calendar.\n\n245\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.850\nAnd the task that we have right now,\nright,\n\n246\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.070\nis that we have some over-allocation\non that resource as well.\n\n247\n00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.940\nIt's perfectly fine and okay, right?\n\n248\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.090\nSo that was what was put inside of\nour baseline for that one task.\n\n249\n00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.880\nBut let's say now that we\nare monitoring this and\n\n250\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.880\nwe are up to that point in\nour progress in our schedule.\n\n251\n00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.530\nIs that on 9/1 the cubicles were\nbeginning their installation\n\n252\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.140\nafter the delivery and\nthat they had finished about half of that.\n\n253\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.086\nSo I'm gonna come up here to\nthe schedule and select 50%.\n\n254\n00:15:27.086 --> 00:15:31.798\nAnd then when you take a look at the Gantt\nchart over on the right hand side,\n\n255\n00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:35.826\nyou can see the little tiny blue\nline that's inside of course,\n\n256\n00:15:35.826 --> 00:15:40.858\nthe task bar itself, which shows me\nthe progress, which is 50% complete.\n\n257\n00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:45.310\nSo when I take a look at that 50%\ncomplete, and now what ended up happening\n\n258\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.415\nis with some type of emergency that\nwe had with the cubical installer,\n\n259\n00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:53.660\nthey were not able to come in\nthe next day and finish the work.\n\n260\n00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.180\nSo what we have to do is we got\na couple of choices, right?\n\n261\n00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.978\nI can simply extend the duration out,\n\n262\n00:15:59.978 --> 00:16:03.750\nto be able to actually do\na 3 day task if I wanted to.\n\n263\n00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.514\nAnd if I do that,\n\n264\n00:16:04.514 --> 00:16:08.084\nit's gonna recalculate and it's gonna\nactually add in an extra day of work.\n\n265\n00:16:08.084 --> 00:16:11.502\nTo the cubicle installer.\n\n266\n00:16:11.502 --> 00:16:13.320\nSo I could do something like that.\n\n267\n00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.620\nBut remember,\nhe's not actually there on that one day.\n\n268\n00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.220\nSo what would be better would be for\nme to take the remaining work that I have.\n\n269\n00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.660\nIn other words the other 50% of that work,\nand\n\n270\n00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:27.760\nnow have it instead to be rescheduled for\na different day.\n\n271\n00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.300\nSo there's a couple of different\nway where we can go ahead and\n\n272\n00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.000\nreschedule this work if we needed to.\n\n273\n00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.860\nSo we can go to project and\nthen select update project and\n\n274\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:42.250\nwe can re-schedule the uncompleted work to\nstart after a certain day if we want to.\n\n275\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.820\nBut we've already seen\nthat in another episode.\n\n276\n00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.960\nSo let me show you another\nway to also do this.\n\n277\n00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.830\nA little bit more manual, and a little\nbit more hands on in how we can do this.\n\n278\n00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.290\nSo another way to do is is by using,\n\n279\n00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:58.230\nif I go back to task here, inside of\nschedule grouping you have what looks like\n\n280\n00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.410\na broken blue bar here which\nis what we call a split task.\n\n281\n00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.170\nBecause we only finished the task on,\nwell 50% percent of that task,\n\n282\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.880\nthat two day task, and what I have is, of\ncourse then, 50% of the work can be done.\n\n283\n00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.020\nThey said they can't come\nin the following day.\n\n284\n00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.660\nBut what if they can come in\nthe day after that instead?\n\n285\n00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.260\nWell, I can go ahead and split that task.\n\n286\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.510\nSo let me select that and\n\n287\n00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.800\nwhen I do that notice it actually\ngives me a nice little diagram.\n\n288\n00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.130\nIt says hey,\ninsert a split into that task.\n\n289\n00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.440\nWell, normally when I do that\nI can just select that bar.\n\n290\n00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.120\nAnd I can insert a split and that will\ngive it an automatic one day split.\n\n291\n00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.910\nNow you can adjust it for longer by\nhovering over that bar if you want to and\n\n292\n00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.360\nit turns into a compass point.\n\n293\n00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.963\nYou can drag it wherever you want to.\n\n294\n00:17:41.963 --> 00:17:43.620\nBut let's just use this instead.\n\n295\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.310\nThis one day split that I have.\n\n296\n00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.290\nAnd now lets say we actually get\na report that he did finish and\n\n297\n00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.190\neven though it actually looks like\ntwo separate tasks, they are linked,\n\n298\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.240\nyou can see that little in between.\n\n299\n00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.300\nAnd I can simply mark that as\nbeing complete at this point and\n\n300\n00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.858\nwe are fine and ready to go.\n\n301\n00:18:01.858 --> 00:18:06.710\nNow notice now that the cubicle\ninstallation, even though it began on 9/1,\n\n302\n00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:13.060\nand is going to finish on 9/3,\nwhich is a three day duration.\n\n303\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.230\nNotice that the task is still showing up\nas only two days, which is what we want,\n\n304\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.896\nright, and 16 hours of work.\n\n305\n00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:21.910\nIf I had stretched it out over three days\nit would actually be a little bit more,\n\n306\n00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:22.495\n24 hours instead.\n\n307\n00:18:22.495 --> 00:18:27.435\nBut we're able to account for\nthat split in that task to do that.\n\n308\n00:18:27.435 --> 00:18:34.485\nSo from here, what did it actually do\nto the variance of the date itself?\n\n309\n00:18:34.485 --> 00:18:38.525\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nsome of those different things too.\n\n310\n00:18:38.525 --> 00:18:43.455\nThe way to see that is if I go back\nup to the gant chart view, and\n\n311\n00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:45.545\nthen i select the tracking gant.\n\n312\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.560\nLet me select that and\ngo to scroll to task, and\n\n313\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.980\nwe will now see a couple\nof different things too.\n\n314\n00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.430\nSo right here under that,\nif I select a tracking gant,\n\n315\n00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:00.140\nit's now allowing me to visually\nsee that there is a difference.\n\n316\n00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.160\nYou can see right here on this line 18\nwhere it's actually got it hovered in\n\n317\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.870\na little bit, or focused in,\nthat original blue bar that,\n\n318\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.080\nlet me see if I can hover and\nget it to do what I want to.\n\n319\n00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.780\nSo that's the actuality.\n\n320\n00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.280\nIn other words, the blue bar,\n\n321\n00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.830\nthe one that's actually in color,\nis actually what happened.\n\n322\n00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.390\nThe gray bar down here or\n\n323\n00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.860\nthe black bar represents what\nwe call the baseline as well.\n\n324\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.230\nSo this way I can start to see that\neverything was actually on schedule\n\n325\n00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.330\nup into this point in time.\n\n326\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.710\nNotice that the gray bars and\n\n327\n00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.380\nthe blue bars are actually\ndirectly on top of each other?\n\n328\n00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.240\nAnd that means the baseline\nwork that I had scheduled out,\n\n329\n00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.410\nthe actual work looks like\nit actually did complete.\n\n330\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.540\nI didn't actually have all\nthose completions there.\n\n331\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.936\nBut you can see right here where\nthere's actually a difference.\n\n332\n00:19:42.936 --> 00:19:47.990\nWith a 100% complete in\nthis bar you can see that\n\n333\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.780\nnow it's actually pushed it out and that\nput everything else on a critical path.\n\n334\n00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.390\nAnd we'll talk about that a little\nbit later in another episode as well.\n\n335\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.760\nBut notice by pushing that out, the rest\nof the project essentially turned red,\n\n336\n00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.320\nand you can see where\nthe original baseline stuff\n\n337\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.270\nis no longer lining up\nto where it needs to be.\n\n338\n00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.530\nAnd so we're actually starting to\nsee those variances right there.\n\n339\n00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.010\nNow, sometimes when we start seeing\nthat it's not enough just to see it in\n\n340\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.180\nthat view.\n\n341\n00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.580\nBut that's when we can go back to View and\nwe can also go to Table and\n\n342\n00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.160\nstart seeing things like\ntracking here as well.\n\n343\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.620\nAnd let's see if that's actually\ngonna be the one that I want\n\n344\n00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.050\nif it compares it against the duration,\nwhich it does not.\n\n345\n00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:30.960\nLet me switch to another one then and\ngo to the Variance table.\n\n346\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.440\nAnd that's what we wanted to see instead.\n\n347\n00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.410\nSo, for this one and\ninstalling the cubicles,\n\n348\n00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.820\nlet me see if I actually\nselected the right task here.\n\n349\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.620\nAnd under deployment phase, I'm looking\nfor installing cubicles, right there.\n\n350\n00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.710\nAnd now notice that the start and\n\n351\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:51.210\nthe finish are exactly what we\nare working with right now.\n\n352\n00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.390\nAnd then you can compare it against\nthe baseline start dates and\n\n353\n00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.670\nwhen you take a look at both of those,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n354\n00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.190\nThe first and the first,\nwhich is what we wanted.\n\n355\n00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.360\nBut now notice that the original\nbaseline finish was 9/2,\n\n356\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.210\nand now the current finish is 9/3.\n\n357\n00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:11.210\nBeing able to see a variance from right\nthere and then noticing that from this\n\n358\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:16.760\npoint on in my project, if I had scheduled\neverything else up into this day I could\n\n359\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.220\ntake a look at those finished variances in\nzero days means everything is on track.\n\n360\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.810\nA one day duration,\nnotice that that one day actually affected\n\n361\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:31.250\nthe rest of my schedule and threw off\nevery other task by one day as well.\n\n362\n00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.840\nAnd that's what we're looking for,\n\n363\n00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.950\nis that this one task right here\ncan throw off the schedule.\n\n364\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.550\nAnd from this point on, because I can't\naffect everything ahead of the schedule,\n\n365\n00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.790\nit's everything afterwards that I might\nneed to try and adjust my schedule\n\n366\n00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.160\nto be able to see all of the different\nvariances that I need to and\n\n367\n00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.530\nthen get everything back on track\nthe way that I want to as well.\n\n368\n00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.320\nSo inside of Microsoft Project\nthere are a ton\n\n369\n00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.880\nof different ways that we can track\nthe cost scheduling and the variances.\n\n370\n00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.914\nWe can track of course the word\nappearances as well as the date\n\n371\n00:22:01.914 --> 00:22:03.500\nvariances as well.\n\n372\n00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.680\nSo being able to see all that makes you\na more effective project planner and\n\n373\n00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.670\nallows you to be able to use Project\nto it's fullest ability as you begin to\n\n374\n00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:16.720\ntrack the progress and begin to see those\nvariances inside a Microsoft project.\n\n375\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.020\nSo by doing that, you become a better and\nmore effective project planner and\n\n376\n00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:25.550\nthat way you can actually use it as a tool\nto help you out to be able to maintain\n\n377\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.380\nthe schedule of your project as well.\n\n378\n00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.520\nAnd that finishes up our show on Microsoft\nProject and working with variances.\n\n379\n00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.620\nThank you for watching.\n\n380\n00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.240\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n381\n00:22:35.240 -->

--> 00:00:16.660\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.130\ntoday, we'll be taking a look at\nworking with Microsoft Project.\n\n5\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.790\nSpecifically, dealing with some of\nthe different scheduling issues\n\n6\n00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.963\nthat can actually arise, and\n\n7\n00:00:24.963 --> 00:00:28.700\nwe're gonna actually be taking a look at\nhow Microsoft project helps us to identify\n\n8\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.650\nthose issues as well as to resolve some\nof those issues if we run across them.\n\n9\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.790\nThat's what we want to take a look at and\ndo.\n\n10\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.256\nTo actually be able to say Microsoft gives\nus the ability to actually work a little\n\n11\n00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:42.962\nbit quicker if we take\nadvantage of those tools.\n\n12\n00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:46.247\nNow, when we have scheduling\nissues inside a Microsoft project,\n\n13\n00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:50.980\na lot of us if we've been working with\nMicrosoft Project were used to doing this.\n\n14\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.990\nReally by just some of the hints that it\ngives us and then we manually go in and\n\n15\n00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.820\nwe adjust the scheduling options and\nwe adjust everything that we need to\n\n16\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.180\nto make sure that we can actually\nkeep everything on track.\n\n17\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.560\nThat's what we'd really want to be able\nto do is to make sure everything stays on\n\n18\n00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.570\ntrack here.\n\n19\n00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.190\nIn the way that our project plan\nactually says that they're supposed to.\n\n20\n00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.050\nSo when we start taking a look at\nmaking sure that we're doing this,\n\n21\n00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.560\nsometimes it's very difficult if\nwe're actually just beginning,\n\n22\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.380\nto actually figure out what's\nhappening on our project.\n\n23\n00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.130\nAnd then, once we get used to that,\n\n24\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.890\nthen actually figuring what happens when\nsome of these other indicators pop up, and\n\n25\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.850\nthen, that way, we actually can work\nwith them and see what's happening.\n\n26\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.830\nLet me show you an example of\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n27\n00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.300\nSo, I've got my project plan pulled up.\n\n28\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.930\nAnd, remember that what we have here is\na project plan that is now ready to go.\n\n29\n00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.050\nIf everything is actually set and\nready, then we're fine and\n\n30\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.670\nwe just continue to work with it.\n\n31\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.510\nBut, let's say that we are right before\nbeing able to take our snapshot of\n\n32\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.780\nour project plan.\n\n33\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.150\nIn other words, we think everything's\nactually set up the way that we want to.\n\n34\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.140\nBut before we do so, we're starting\nto notice some of the issues, and\n\n35\n00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.800\nwhat we're looking at now is actually\nunderneath this column right here, over to\n\n36\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.010\nthe far left hand side, to the left of\nthe task mode, which says indicators.\n\n37\n00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.160\nIndicators are little icons that end up\nshowing up and if you take a look at them,\n\n38\n00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.000\nthere's actually many different types\nof indicators that you can see.\n\n39\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.570\nThe one that you're probably looking for,\n\n40\n00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.490\nespecially when we start dealing with\nscheduling conflicts, it's usually due to\n\n41\n00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.050\nthe very fact that resources have\nbeen over allocated a lot of times.\n\n42\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.620\nWhen you start seeing stuff like that,\nit actually is just a little red icon.\n\n43\n00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.100\nIt's supposed to be an individual person.\n\n44\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.890\nAnd when you hover over it,\n\n45\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.880\nit tells you that this task has\nbeen over allocated resource.\n\n46\n00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.580\nAnd then we can right click for options.\n\n47\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.130\nBut notice that there are other indicators\nas well that are trying to give us hints\n\n48\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.280\nabout why this task is well,\nreally doing what it's doing.\n\n49\n00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.820\nSo you might actually find out\nthat as you start doing the auto\n\n50\n00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.800\nscheduling of the project,\neverything is working out.\n\n51\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.530\nUntil the point where you start\nseeing a lot of different icons.\n\n52\n00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.290\nAnd some of them are just static\npieces of information like what we\n\n53\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.770\nfind inside of notes.\n\n54\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.960\nInside of notes we might find the reason,\n\n55\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.405\nthe logical reason why this\ntask was set up the way it was.\n\n56\n00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:09.205\nWe might also see that\nthere's a task constraint\n\n57\n00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:13.345\nto ensure that when Project is starting\nup, it actually will work that way in\n\n58\n00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:17.305\nthe way that we've actually said it should\nwork and it's not auto adjusting to that.\n\n59\n00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:19.255\nSo we're essentially\nsetting that override.\n\n60\n00:03:19.255 --> 00:03:22.725\nAnd we may also find out this has also\nbeen assigned to a different calendar as\n\n61\n00:03:22.725 --> 00:03:26.405\nwell, or to a specific one, and then\nwhether or not there's over allocations.\n\n62\n00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.510\nSo there's plenty of that going on.\n\n63\n00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.650\nNow on this project,\nyou might be wondering Ronnie,\n\n64\n00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.770\nit looks like every other task\nis actually over allocated.\n\n65\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.970\nThat's because I have a small\nset of work resources, and\n\n66\n00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.480\nthey're kind of assigned\nto every single project.\n\n67\n00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.720\nBut let's show you how a work\nresource gets over allocated.\n\n68\n00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.190\nThe easiest way to do that is I'm gonna\nbring up a brand new project here.\n\n69\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.140\nSo that we can go ahead and\nsee it from scratch when we do that\n\n70\n00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.600\ninstead of one that I already\nworked with at this point.\n\n71\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.850\nSo, I'm simply gonna make a very\ngeneric project plan for us.\n\n72\n00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.797\nAnd I'm gonna add in just\na few different tasks.\n\n73\n00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.190\nAnd I'm gonna add in\ndurations here as well.\n\n74\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.280\n23 days, that's a little bit\nlonger than I wanted to.\n\n75\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.495\nThree, four days, perfectly fine so\n\n76\n00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:17.921\nwe now have a task in our\nduration that we have setup.\n\n77\n00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:22.270\nAnd then from that point I can go ahead\nand set a different view here under\n\n78\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.910\nFormat I'm gonna do a project summary\ntask so that we can see that the overall\n\n79\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.540\nduration for everything that we've\ngot set up right now is four days.\n\n80\n00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.580\nEverything is starting on\nthe same day perfectly fine, but\n\n81\n00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.880\nI don't have any resources set up for\nthese tasks yet.\n\n82\n00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.695\nSo, I need to go ahead and\nalso assign some different resources.\n\n83\n00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:46.260\nI'm gonna click on Resource and then I'm\ngonna select a resource pool that I have\n\n84\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.090\nup and available for my company resources\nand go ahead and add those in there.\n\n85\n00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.450\nNow when I do that,\nthen I can use the dividing bar and\n\n86\n00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.640\nunder resource name for\ntask one, I can go ahead and\n\n87\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.070\nstart assigning some of the different\nresources that I might have available.\n\n88\n00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.590\nSo this is not exactly anything that\nI'm doing here overwhelmingly neatly so\n\n89\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.270\nI'm going to select network technician and\nsupport technician for the second one\n\n90\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.860\nand continue to do this all the way down\nnetwork technician, support technician.\n\n91\n00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.670\nEven here, and then even this one, and\n\n92\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.900\ndo the same thing, Network Technician and\nalso the Support Technician as well, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.290\nSo if my project plans are all starting,\n\n94\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.900\nlet's say on the very same day,\nwhich is today's date here.\n\n95\n00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.430\nI can also use that little\ndividing bar and drop on down.\n\n96\n00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.880\nNotice that what happened\nimmediately is that,\n\n97\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.260\nover here on the left hand side,\nit went ahead and gave me an indication.\n\n98\n00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.000\nNow, on this day,\non the start date of this project, and\n\n99\n00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.980\nthat would actually be following\nthis blue line right here,\n\n100\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.610\nnotice that a network technician has\nactually been assigned all four of those.\n\n101\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.000\nNow you and\nI are used to looking at things linearly.\n\n102\n00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.610\nAnd what that means is that what we're\nseeing a lot of times in our mind is that\n\n103\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.850\nNetwork Technician 1, well,\nhe's gonna do that one task and\n\n104\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.600\nthen he'll start the second task and\nthen he'll start the third task and\n\n105\n00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.370\nthen he'll start the fourth task.\n\n106\n00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.370\nBut the way that our project schedule is\nshowing up is that here on the Tuesday,\n\n107\n00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.260\nthe 21st, which is today.\n\n108\n00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.670\nHe's actually starting on all four\ntasks really at the same time.\n\n109\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.900\nAnd you can actually see that for\nall four of those tasks.\n\n110\n00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.110\nAnd when we do something like that, if\nit's on the standard scheduled calendar,\n\n111\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.550\nwhich this one is cuz I\ndidn't change the calendar,\n\n112\n00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.270\nwell that means he's gonna\nwork an eight hour day.\n\n113\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.903\nAnd in theory he's gonna work eight hours\non task one, eight hours on task two,\n\n114\n00:06:39.903 --> 00:06:43.480\neight hours on task three,\neight hours on task four.\n\n115\n00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.650\nSo on that one day,\nhe's actually scheduled really for\n\n116\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:52.620\nwell 32 hours on a 24 hour day,\nwhich is just about impossible.\n\n117\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.380\nUnless you're traveling\nback through time or\n\n118\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.580\nyou're part of Harry Potter or something.\n\n119\n00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.940\nSo, it's actually not\nworking this way right?\n\n120\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.340\nBut the good thing is Project\nautomatically saw this.\n\n121\n00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.880\nAnd we can see what's actually happening.\n\n122\n00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.000\nSo even though you may not actually\nlook at it, if you're new to Project and\n\n123\n00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.580\nyou're like why is this happening?\n\n124\n00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.420\nOne of the good thing this\nProject tries to help you out.\n\n125\n00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.940\nSo if I right click on let's\nsay one of these tasks,\n\n126\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.500\nnotice it also gives me a couple\nof options here, right?\n\n127\n00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.840\nSo on an over allocation\nof a specific resource,\n\n128\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.880\nyou really have just a couple\nof things that you can do.\n\n129\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.400\nSo, when you take a look at it,\n\n130\n00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.337\nhere are some of the manual\noptions that it's telling you.\n\n131\n00:07:31.337 --> 00:07:34.680\nOne It says reschedule\nto an available date.\n\n132\n00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.260\nOn an over allocation,\n\n133\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.330\nwhat would normally end up happening here\nis that you move this particular task\n\n134\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.370\nto a day where he is not actually\nbeing scheduled on that same day.\n\n135\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.968\nLet me show you what we can do manually.\n\n136\n00:07:46.968 --> 00:07:51.812\nSo, notice that all I really need to do is\nlet's take this one task here on task one\n\n137\n00:07:51.812 --> 00:07:52.823\nand I can click.\n\n138\n00:07:52.823 --> 00:07:56.096\nAnd let me drag it all the way over here,\nlet's say to, well, Monday.\n\n139\n00:07:56.096 --> 00:07:56.821\nOkay?\n\n140\n00:07:56.821 --> 00:07:58.809\nWhen I do something, oh,\nI dragged it on Saturday.\n\n141\n00:07:58.809 --> 00:08:00.302\nLet me do it a little bit further.\n\n142\n00:08:00.302 --> 00:08:01.220\nThere we go.\n\n143\n00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.550\nWhen I dragged it to the Monday,\nwhich is a working day,\n\n144\n00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:09.240\nthat's why we were still here, notice it\nallows me to actually be able to do that.\n\n145\n00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.350\nAnd when it does it, it automatically\nnow has removed that over allocation.\n\n146\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.600\nBut something I did even by accident\nwas actually kind of a good thing for\n\n147\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.040\nus to also note.\n\n148\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.965\nEvery once in while,\nwhen we are manually doing things and\n\n149\n00:08:20.965 --> 00:08:26.110\nwe're not paying attention, let's say that\nI had absolutely thought I had assigned it\n\n150\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:31.160\nto the right day and I contact the network\ntechnician and I tell him that he is\n\n151\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:37.780\nscheduled to work on July 25th, which\nright here is actually a non working day.\n\n152\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.410\nWell, notice the over allocation\nshows up immediately, so\n\n153\n00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.190\nit doesn't mean that I can't call and\n\n154\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.520\nmake a mistake, it means that project says\nlook, here reporting to this calendar.\n\n155\n00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.950\nThis is a non working day and\n\n156\n00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.490\nyou should not actually schedule that\nresource to work on that day, so\n\n157\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.460\nvisually it gives us a nice little\nindicator of what can be done.\n\n158\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:02.366\nNow if I go back, let me put everything\nback to the original date here.\n\n159\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.640\nAll the way back,\none day before that, let's do this.\n\n160\n00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.470\nOh, if it lets me move it.\n\n161\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.230\nThere we go.\n\n162\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.750\nTook a little bit of time there.\n\n163\n00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.640\nSo if I move it back, I can do that.\n\n164\n00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.080\nSo I can manually do that.\n\n165\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.800\nNow more than likely, you can do\nthat just using a view like this.\n\n166\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.350\nMost of us,\n\n167\n00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.130\nif we're going to be trying to manually\nadjust the over allocations themselves,\n\n168\n00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.330\nwe instead are probably gonna end up using\nthat team planner view to do it instead.\n\n169\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.810\nSo that's a possible option that\nyou have available to you, and\n\n170\n00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.240\nyou'll actually now be\nable to use it as a table.\n\n171\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.390\nYou'll actually be able to click and drag\nthose resources where you need them, and\n\n172\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.920\neven be able to see if there's\nany unassigned tasks as well.\n\n173\n00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.520\nNow the other thing that we can also do to\nhelp us prevent this over-allocation is\n\n174\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.040\nsimple.\n\n175\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.620\nNotice that on this one day task,\nbecause he's over-allocated,\n\n176\n00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.300\nI might be able add in more resources\nif this is an effort driven task.\n\n177\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:57.910\nOkay?\n\n178\n00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.520\nSo on task number one, let me see\nwhat happens here if I go ahead and\n\n179\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.310\nassign an additional resource instead.\n\n180\n00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.930\nSo, I could possibly assign,\nlet's say the project manager here.\n\n181\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.266\nAnd let me go ahead and assign another\none and see what happens as well.\n\n182\n00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:17.890\nLet's see, let's do the Support Technician\nand assign him too.\n\n183\n00:10:19.627 --> 00:10:23.007\nAnd now, notice the even with\nthose three actually going on,\n\n184\n00:10:23.007 --> 00:10:26.050\nwell why didn't that actually change for\nhim?\n\n185\n00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.670\nWell because according to this,\nhe's still assigned, well, 72 hours.\n\n186\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.460\nSo even though I added\nin all of this stuff.\n\n187\n00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:38.040\nOr he's assigned to not 72 hours,\n32 hours over that same day, right?\n\n188\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.340\nAdding in more resources sometimes can\nhelp if you're dividing up that work.\n\n189\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.230\nNow, you can also right\nclick on that task and\n\n190\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.240\ngo under resources and\nactually change the units here.\n\n191\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.480\nSo let's say instead that\nI changed him down to,\n\n192\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.265\nlet's say 25 oercent if\nI can get him there.\n\n193\n00:10:58.265 --> 00:11:03.479\n25 percent of his working time and then\nI'd have to go to another task that day\n\n194\n00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:08.470\nand also, let's say I assigned them\nto 25 percent of that working time,\n\n195\n00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:14.725\nAnd do the same thing for\nthose other two tasks.\n\n196\n00:11:16.725 --> 00:11:18.735\nLet me see if I can get\nthat done quickly here.\n\n197\n00:11:19.815 --> 00:11:24.828\n25 percent, and\nlet's do the same thing here.\n\n198\n00:11:27.182 --> 00:11:31.640\n25% as well.\n\n199\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.310\nAnd even though it actually is now showing\n100 percent, in other words, two hours per\n\n200\n00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.530\ntask, there's a bunch of other things\nthat are also going on as well.\n\n201\n00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.940\nSo now if I take a look under\nthis task resource assignment,\n\n202\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.990\nnow if I hover over it, it's saying,\nhey this task is still over allocated.\n\n203\n00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.280\nIf I right click and\n\n204\n00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:55.220\nI select Fix in Task Inspector,\nnow we can start to see something.\n\n205\n00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.430\nWell the reason why it actually\ndidn't work is because now\n\n206\n00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.690\nthe network technician is not the one\nthat's been over allocated here,\n\n207\n00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:07.550\nwhat we start to see is that the resources\nare allocated is the support tech.\n\n208\n00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.680\nSo sometimes you might see\nissues like that that arrive for\n\n209\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.890\nyou to be able to do that.\n\n210\n00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.020\nAnd here they show you a couple of\ndifferent options that you can also use.\n\n211\n00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.980\nNotice that under the actions\nyou can reschedule the task.\n\n212\n00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.918\nAnd that's what we're ready to talk about,\nis to manually reschedule the task.\n\n213\n00:12:22.918 --> 00:12:27.690\nWe can re-assign the units of\nallocation just like we did,\n\n214\n00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.800\nif we're taking about manually doing it.\n\n215\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.300\nWe can also assign additional\nresources as an effort driven task.\n\n216\n00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.230\nNormally that time period then would\nbe split up among the three, and\n\n217\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.280\nwe can also do that as well.\n\n218\n00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.240\nAnd the other thing that we can\ndo is just simply remove that\n\n219\n00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.890\none task if we needed to,\nto just get it out of the picture.\n\n220\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.630\nNow of course, that might not be up to us.\n\n221\n00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.100\nIn other words, if we're removing one of\nthe task requirements that may actually\n\n222\n00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.230\nhave to involve, of course, a medium\nthat says look, we really can't do that,\n\n223\n00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.190\nwe're over allocated and\nthis is the task I think we should remove.\n\n224\n00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.860\nSo you might actually have to go back\nto your project stake holders to do\n\n225\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.200\nthat as well.\n\n226\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.950\nBut, lets say that we're not\ngoing to do any of that.\n\n227\n00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.420\nSo instead, the good thing is since\nproject does have this task inspector, and\n\n228\n00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.010\nit's a really incredible tool here.\n\n229\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.680\nIt tells me what do the two that I might\nactually choose to go ahead and do.\n\n230\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.200\nSo it says we can move the resource\nto the next available time.\n\n231\n00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.740\nLet's see what happens if I do that and\nsee where project would put this task.\n\n232\n00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.470\nSo if I go ahead and\n\n233\n00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:28.370\nreschedule that task, notice that he did\nexactly what I would do, which is he\n\n234\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.640\nmoved that to the following week to go\nahead and get started there instead.\n\n235\n00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.530\nSo we could do something\nlike that as well.\n\n236\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:39.070\nNow, notice that we also can go ahead and\nauto schedule too and so\n\n237\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:43.090\nit's telling us here's the best way to\nstart fixing stuff, so that that way it's\n\n238\n00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:47.260\nstarts to adjust it automatically if other\nthings start to happen to our schedule.\n\n239\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.910\nSo the task inspector is one of these\nthings that we can go ahead and\n\n240\n00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.000\ntake a look at to be able to do as well.\n\n241\n00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.830\nNow once we start doing that and\nwe get everything in line here,\n\n242\n00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.830\nwell we still have to do\na couple of other things for\n\n243\n00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.210\nour project to make\na little bit more sense.\n\n244\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.660\nSo I'm gonna select all four of\nthose tasks and link them together.\n\n245\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.890\nWhen I do that notice that they\nactually stop being over allocated.\n\n246\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.060\nAnd once you start seeing stuff like that,\n\n247\n00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:20.190\nnow you can see if I can move this\nscan bar over just a little bit here.\n\n248\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.140\nYou now start to see where\nthey're scheduled in a finish to\n\n249\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.890\nstart relationship which\nis perfectly fine.\n\n250\n00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.010\nAnd that's what we really want to see\na lot of times when we're actually having\n\n251\n00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.520\nthese tasks do what they need to do.\n\n252\n00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.990\nNow if they have to be scheduled on the\nsame day then they have to, but remember,\n\n253\n00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.740\nyour resources may not actually\nbe able to spend all the time\n\n254\n00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.560\nthat you've devoted in your\nproject plan in doing that.\n\n255\n00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.830\nSo remember that, that when you start\ndealing with over-allocations or\n\n256\n00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.600\nresource issues that are gonna\ncause scheduling issues here,\n\n257\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.280\nyou have to take a look and see whether or\nnot, even if you used a task inspector,\n\n258\n00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.990\nwhether or not that's going to actually\nbe appropriate to your schedule.\n\n259\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.910\nIs this too far to push out for\nfour different tasks instead.\n\n260\n00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:01.860\nAnd if it is, you actually have to figure\nthat out and what else you can do as well.\n\n261\n00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.550\nSo not only can we see that, but\n\n262\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:08.500\nlet's see what also happens then with\na task and what can be affected.\n\n263\n00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.430\nSo when we take a look at task number one,\nthis one task, and it's actually\n\n264\n00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:19.270\nin this relationship, notice it affected\nall the other tasks it ends up following.\n\n265\n00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.050\nWe might also want to see what\ntask directly effects this task.\n\n266\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.395\nAnd that way we might find out that we\ncan actually do some adjustments up there\n\n267\n00:15:26.395 --> 00:15:27.935\nin the over allocation.\n\n268\n00:15:27.935 --> 00:15:30.855\nAssign different resources that would\nshorten the task before that and\n\n269\n00:15:30.855 --> 00:15:35.045\nallow this task to expand out the way\nit needs to, or we may find out that\n\n270\n00:15:35.045 --> 00:15:38.685\nif I don't do anything about this\ntask what's also gonna be effected.\n\n271\n00:15:38.685 --> 00:15:40.935\nSo, let's take a look at that as well.\n\n272\n00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:44.960\nSo let me go back to my\nlarger project plan here.\n\n273\n00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.496\nI just wanted to show you some\nof the ways that the ins and\n\n274\n00:15:47.496 --> 00:15:50.546\nouts actually work without affecting\nmy schedule too much here.\n\n275\n00:15:50.546 --> 00:15:55.988\nSo let's say that right here on\nthis installing the cubicles here.\n\n276\n00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:58.863\nOn this one task I want to see,\n\n277\n00:15:58.863 --> 00:16:04.506\nWhat task is actually going\nto be driving this one, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.486\nIn other words,\n\n279\n00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:10.880\nis there a preceding task that affects\nthe schedule of this task itself, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.370\nI also want to be able to see whether or\nnot this task itself and what\n\n281\n00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.560\nare the other tasks that will be affected\nby it if I change that schedule as well.\n\n282\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.730\nNow, sometimes you don't wanna\ndo that inside a project.\n\n283\n00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.570\nYou just wanna see it, right?\n\n284\n00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.980\nSo, the good thing is,\ninside a project, I can go to Project.\n\n285\n00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.170\nOh, it's not in Project, is it?\n\n286\n00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:31.750\nLet me make sure.\n\n287\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.440\nOh, Format.\n\n288\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.650\nSee, I always forget.\n\n289\n00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.710\nSo, it's actually under Format here.\n\n290\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:40.400\nUnder Format, what I'm looking for is\nanother utility that you find right here\n\n291\n00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.100\nonly really in Project 2013,\nwhich is called the Task Path.\n\n292\n00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.830\nAnd what this will do instead is it\nwill highlight those paths for us.\n\n293\n00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.295\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n294\n00:16:50.295 --> 00:16:54.610\nI've selected 3.5 on\nthe cubicle installation.\n\n295\n00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.360\nLet me see, is that a good one to select?\n\n296\n00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.480\nLet's do 3.1, because I already\nhave a constraint on that one.\n\n297\n00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.020\nActually, yeah, let's do that.\n\n298\n00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.810\nOkay.\nNow I'm gonna select Task.\n\n299\n00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.742\nAnd then notice I can select Predecessors.\n\n300\n00:17:05.742 --> 00:17:09.390\nAnd when I do that, it doesn't look like\nit actually has been affected by anything.\n\n301\n00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.920\nBut it's not right there.\n\n302\n00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.510\nIt's under the Gantt chart.\n\n303\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.140\nRight?\n\n304\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:18.520\nSo if I scroll the Gantt chart over,\nyou can now see that in yellow,\n\n305\n00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.830\nhere are all the tasks that did proceed\n\n306\n00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:27.730\nthat are also going to affect the start\ndate of this task as well, except for\n\n307\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.220\nthis little lag time that I\nhave adjusted right here.\n\n308\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.590\nSo it actually shows me\nall those preceding tasks.\n\n309\n00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.450\nSo if I go ahead and select that again,\nI can select Driving Predecessor, and\n\n310\n00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.610\nnotice if I select that, it says,\n\n311\n00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.840\nHighlight predecessors that\ndirectly affect the selected task.\n\n312\n00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.200\nIf I select that one, I actually don't see\nthat, cuz that was supposed to turn it\n\n313\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.710\ninto an orange one, so it doesn't\nlook like there was anything driving.\n\n314\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.440\nAnd the reason why it's not a driving\n\n315\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:59.010\nforce right now is because\nof that task constraint.\n\n316\n00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.180\nSo that constraint that actually let it\ngo over the weekend before it started is\n\n317\n00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.340\nprobably not gonna do that.\n\n318\n00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.710\nBut then I can see what\nit succeeds it too.\n\n319\n00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:11.940\nSo when I take a look here, by affecting\nthat one task in the cubicle installation,\n\n320\n00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.230\nnotice it affects all of the other\ntasks that follow it down here as well.\n\n321\n00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.580\nAnd notice that I'm not actually\nadjusting the schedule.\n\n322\n00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.480\nI'm not having to put it in\nfake data to make it work.\n\n323\n00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.950\nI'm trying to see if I\nwere to adjust anything,\n\n324\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.200\nwhat would actually be the one that\nI want, and then driven successors.\n\n325\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.370\nIt shows me that, hey,\nthis one task actually affected\n\n326\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.280\nthe progress of all these other\ntasks that are also available too.\n\n327\n00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.960\nSo there are a couple of different ways\nthat you can begin to take a look and\n\n328\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.560\nsee that information\nright in front of you.\n\n329\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.380\nAnd then, that way you can make\nthe decisions that you need to.\n\n330\n00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.920\nSo by being able to take a look at\nsome of the different indicators\n\n331\n00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.070\nthat you see over here in the indicator\ncolumn, by being able to take advantage\n\n332\n00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.150\nof the Task Inspector, which I can't\nremember what it was called there,\n\n333\n00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.800\nthe Task Inspector as\nwell as that Task Path,\n\n334\n00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.380\nyou're able to use some of those tools to\nshow you how you can deal with some of\n\n335\n00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.480\nthose resource scheduling conflicts\nthat you may come up with.\n\n336\n00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.620\nBut usually,\nmost of us have been working with Project.\n\n337\n00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.630\nInstead of relying on those tools,\nit's a lot better at times to go ahead and\n\n338\n00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.770\nmanually be able to make those\nadjustments, so that way you see\n\n339\n00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.530\nthe information right in front of you, and\nnot just relying on those project tools.\n\n340\n00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:30.000\nBut they are there for you to be able to\nwork with, for you to take advantage of,\n\n341\n00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.550\nso a lot of times if you actually are\ntrying to make a lot of those decisions,\n\n342\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.570\nthe Task Inspector will\nguide you on the right path.\n\n343\n00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.270\nBut remember, it's actually gonna use\nwhat it believes is gonna be the best and\n\n344\n00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.230\nproper way to do what it needs to do.\n\n345\n00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.410\nAnd sometimes in reality, right, we need\nProject to actually show the way that\n\n346\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.930\nwe want to control the schedule instead.\n\n347\n00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.980\nSo take advantage of the tools,\nbut remember, rely on your\n\n348\n00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.940\nown best knowledge to make sure that\nthe project plan is going your way.\n\n349\n00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.270\nWell, that wraps it up for us for our\nMicrosoft Project and dealing with some of\n\n350\n00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:06.010\nthe different resource scheduling\nconflicts that we may come up with.\n\n351\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.060\nWe're glad that you're actually\nable to watch us today.\n\n352\n00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.342\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n353\n00:20:12.342 --> 00:20:14.838\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.470\nI'm your host, Ronny Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.840\ntoday we'll be taking a look at\nMicrosoft Project, taking a look at being\n\n5\n00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.320\nable to display what we call the critical\npath inside of our project plan.\n\n6\n00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.650\nWhen we take a look at displaying the\ncritical path, what ends up happening on\n\n7\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.015\nthe project as it starts to go ahead and\nbegin In the add in some progress,\n\n8\n00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:34.415\nwe want to see all of the actual\ntasks that are in line.\n\n9\n00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:37.975\nThat if we affect any one of those\ntasks it effects the overall duration\n\n10\n00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:42.797\nof the project itself and that it what\nwe call the critical path itself.\n\n11\n00:00:42.797 --> 00:00:45.757\nSo you can actually take\na look at doing this manually.\n\n12\n00:00:45.757 --> 00:00:51.117\nAnd if you want to, make sure you head on\nover to the PNP episodes in which we take\n\n13\n00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:55.327\na look, and go ahead and manually show you\nhow to calculate out the critical path.\n\n14\n00:00:55.327 --> 00:00:58.387\nBut since you're working\nwith Microsoft Project, and\n\n15\n00:00:58.387 --> 00:01:01.620\nyou're working with this project\nmanagement tool, Microsoft Project\n\n16\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.920\ngoes ahead and figures out the critical\npath for you to actually say,\n\n17\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.430\nif you will have all this stuff in here,\nI can go ahead and figure that out.\n\n18\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.170\nAnd you might be wondering,\n\n19\n00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.770\nwell why in the world would we\nneed to do something like that?\n\n20\n00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.400\nIt is actually inside of\nthe critical path of your project,\n\n21\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.170\nthat if you affect the duration of\nany one task inside of that path,\n\n22\n00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.700\nit's gonna affect the overall\nduration of the entire project.\n\n23\n00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.260\nSo that gives you the ability, then, to\nknow that if you add in another resource\n\n24\n00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.680\nalong your project plan, is it really\ngonna affect the duration or not?\n\n25\n00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.590\nSo you want to be able to figure that out\nbecause you want to use your resources in\n\n26\n00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.870\nthe most effective location they can\nbe used in in the project plan itself,\n\n27\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.640\nso that you know that you're actually\nadding in tasks where they're actually\n\n28\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.630\ngonna give you the most bang for\nyour buck.\n\n29\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.200\nSo we wanna be able to see how we can\nsee something like that, and of course\n\n30\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.340\nwe wanna show you how you can actually\ndo that inside of Microsoft Project, so\n\n31\n00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.120\nlet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n32\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.040\nSo I'm just using the same project that\nI've been using throughout our series\n\n33\n00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.510\nhere, and taking a look at some\nof the different information.\n\n34\n00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.630\nRemember that when we talk about this\ncritical path and being able to see it, so\n\n35\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.080\nthat way we know where exactly we\nwant to assign those resources\n\n36\n00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.890\nthat should help us to make sure that\nour project is actually on schedule and\n\n37\n00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.660\ncontinuing to do what we need to.\n\n38\n00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.670\nSo along our entire project we've\nhad those three phases, testing,\n\n39\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.770\ndeploying and\nthen there's also the tuning phase, but\n\n40\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.740\nwhere is it that it's actually gonna be\nmost effective that if I need to try and\n\n41\n00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.190\nshorten up the project plan itself, or if\nsomething was actually starting to slip,\n\n42\n00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.540\nI would actually start\nadjusting resources there.\n\n43\n00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.290\nThe easiest way to do that is by selecting\nformat at the top here on the format tab,\n\n44\n00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.770\nand then under the bar styles\ngrouping click on the critical tasks.\n\n45\n00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.810\nOnce we do that if you hover over it,\nit tells exactly what we need here.\n\n46\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.720\nAll of the bars in the Gant chart\nthat are in this critical path\n\n47\n00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.190\nis gonna show up as red.\n\n48\n00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.030\nAnd then it also gives us a nice little\npiece of information, the task is critical\n\n49\n00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.920\nif it must be completed on schedule for\nthe project to finish on schedule as well.\n\n50\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.470\nSo if that task actually finishes late,\nthan the project is actually going to,\n\n51\n00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.120\nagain, extend out a little bit further.\n\n52\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.780\nSo now if I scroll down and\nover here on the right hand side,\n\n53\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.150\nI'm gonna move this divider bar over so\nthat we could see it a little bit better.\n\n54\n00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.130\nYou can see where I have these\nblue bars and also these red bars.\n\n55\n00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.760\nThe red bar is the indication\nof where it's critical for\n\n56\n00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.730\nevery single task to finish on schedule or\nany delay\n\n57\n00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.060\nin these tasks is actually not going to\ndo what we need it to do at this point.\n\n58\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.760\nSo from here if we actually ended up,\nlet's say for\n\n59\n00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.740\nexample here that one of these tasks,\n\n60\n00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.520\nlet's say that verifying the terminal\nserver usage took ten days here instead.\n\n61\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.250\nIf that ends up taking ten days of\nduration, notice that it blew beyond\n\n62\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.070\nthe milestone and the start date or\nthe finish date of my overall project.\n\n63\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.540\nSo anything in here is actually going\nto do something like that if I adjust\n\n64\n00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.910\nanything inside of that red path.\n\n65\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.870\nBut let's say that I come back up here\ninside of the blue path Instead, and\n\n66\n00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.830\ninstalling the premise cabling,\nlet's say it took five days or six days.\n\n67\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.030\nIf I do that, now notice what also\nended up happening, is that the rest of\n\n68\n00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.990\nthe schedule also ended up turning\ninto that critical path as well.\n\n69\n00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.950\nSo if I adjust that back down to what I\nhad it, which was I think three days here.\n\n70\n00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.010\nSo we can increase the critical path and\n\n71\n00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.940\nwe can actually end up seeing\nwhere we can remove some of those.\n\n72\n00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.150\nA lot of times under the effort driven\ntask that you have inside your critical\n\n73\n00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.200\npath, assigning more resources may help,\nor\n\n74\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.130\nyou may end up having to see where\nyou can't really do anything,\n\n75\n00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.520\nyou just have to go ahead and try and make\nsure that all of the tasks that you have\n\n76\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.310\nready to have go on that critical\npath are going to finish on time.\n\n77\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.550\nNow every once in a while, you might be\nwondering, how did we get to this point?\n\n78\n00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.240\nWhere did it happen that it\nswitched from here to here?\n\n79\n00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.000\nAnd you might want to actually\nfigure out how you can do that.\n\n80\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.250\nWell, up here, under the bar\nstalls I can also select slack.\n\n81\n00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.620\nAnd this way you can barely see it,\nbut right here let me go ahead and\n\n82\n00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.120\nclick on it again and\nmaybe we can actually see it as well.\n\n83\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.780\nThe blue bar actually doesn't\nhave anything under it, and\n\n84\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.900\nnow if I select slack it's right here\nbecause of this delay, or this lag time,\n\n85\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.050\nthat we saw that pushed this portion\nof my project into that critical path.\n\n86\n00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.430\nSo you can also see where\nsomething like that can happen.\n\n87\n00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.870\nIf I hover exactly over,\nI don't think I can do that exactly.\n\n88\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.720\nI'm trying to.\nA lot of times you get a little\n\n89\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.380\nmessage that says,\nhere is your slack time.\n\n90\n00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.850\nIn other words, you may be able to tighten\nup the schedule a little bit right here.\n\n91\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.650\nMake sure that things actually start\nhappening a little bit better and\n\n92\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.160\nyou can do that.\n\n93\n00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.980\nWell, you have to deal with constraints.\n\n94\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.280\nSo even though it looks like\nI could start on Monday,\n\n95\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.910\nwell I have this little indication over\nhere that tells me that, hey, they're not\n\n96\n00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.110\nactually going be delivered until Tuesday,\nso there's no use in doing that.\n\n97\n00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.450\nSo I may not be able to adjust\nanything right there, as well.\n\n98\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.520\nSo being able to display stuff\nlike that is a part of it.\n\n99\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.385\nNow, the other thing that we can do in\nthe Gantt chart to help us to see this,\n\n100\n00:06:01.385 --> 00:06:03.300\nis compared against the baseline.\n\n101\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.700\nNow let's see,\ndo I actually have a baseline set here?\n\n102\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.300\nLet me see if I do.\n\n103\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.990\nYep, I do.\n\n104\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.500\nSo now that I've actually adjusted\na couple of things, let me go ahead and\n\n105\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.800\nadjust another things as well.\n\n106\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.580\nSo, let's see, I'm gonna do.\n\n107\n00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.210\nWhat did I do?\n\n108\n00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.590\nOh, premise claim that's the one that\nI kind of got a little bit going here,\n\n109\n00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.060\nlet's do that six days again.\n\n110\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.180\nAnd now look at what happens the entire\nproject goes to the critical path, and\n\n111\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.250\nthen from this point, if I go back\nto format, and I select baseline,\n\n112\n00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.160\nI can compare it to this baseline and\nnow inside of my Gantt chart,\n\n113\n00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.970\nI can see where things started\nto happen right away to.\n\n114\n00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.740\nSo notice that up until the point where we\nstarted installing the premise cabling,\n\n115\n00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.310\nthe premise cabling taking\nlinger than it should,\n\n116\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.290\nreally did push everything\nelse off of its base line.\n\n117\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.780\nSo we can actually go ahead and\n\n118\n00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.670\ndo that as well, visually being able to\nsee it is one of the quickest ways you and\n\n119\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.240\nI can make decisions,\nbased off of that critical path as well.\n\n120\n00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.600\nSo being able to see the critical path\nis something that we all need to do.\n\n121\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.140\nIf we know that our project is right\nthere where we need to go ahead and say,\n\n122\n00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.720\nwhere's the best place I'm gonna need to\nadd in some resources that may help me to\n\n123\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.880\nmaintain and\nfinish all my tasks on schedule.\n\n124\n00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.630\nIt's gonna be in those areas\nwhere we're going to see the red.\n\n125\n00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.070\nIf we need to make sure that we can see\nthat notice that project gives us a very\n\n126\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.780\neasy way to be able to do that and then\nwe can adjust it to actually go ahead and\n\n127\n00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.800\nsee that, hey if I change\nsomething in the schedule is that\n\n128\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.990\nnow actually gonna affect the rest of\nmy schedule, and it absolutely did.\n\n129\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.530\nSo inside of Microsoft Project, it's\nfairly easy to display the critical path,\n\n130\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.980\nand see what needs to be done.\n\n131\n00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.310\nNow understanding that critical path\nmethodology requires a little bit of math.\n\n132\n00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.420\nKnowing about early start dates, and\nlate start dates, and finish dates, etc.\n\n133\n00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.680\nYou need to be able to understand that\nas well and if you want to remember\n\n134\n00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.020\ntake a look at those PNP shows and\nthat will help you out as well.\n\n135\n00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.620\nSo that for us ends our show here on\ntaking a look at the critical path method\n\n136\n00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.310\ninside of Microsoft Project.\n\n137\n00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.350\nWell thank you for watching today.\n\n138\n00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.440\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n",

00:00:15.586\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:18.826\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronny Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:19.670\nHow's it going, Ronny?\n\n6\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.700\n>> It is going great today.\n\n7\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.428\nFeels good,\n\n8\n00:00:21.428 --> 00:00:25.802\nready to get started in some of our\ntechnology on Microsoft Project 2013.\n\n9\n00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:29.645\n>> Now Ronny, we're winding down to\nsome of the last parts of Project, and\n\n10\n00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:32.795\nthis last section is really one\nof the more important ones,\n\n11\n00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:37.030\ncuz it's on how we get information out of\nProject to present it to other people.\n\n12\n00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.230\nNow If you guys have been watching\nour other videos you know\n\n13\n00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.660\nthere's a lot of data\ninside a Microsoft Project.\n\n14\n00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.930\nIf you fully populated it with all your\nProject data and you have a big Project\n\n15\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.670\nit starts to become really challenging\nto see patterns in your data or\n\n16\n00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.100\neven just to find specific\ndata that you're looking for.\n\n17\n00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.600\nSo we're gonna take a look at some of\nthe ways that we can customize Project.\n\n18\n00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.000\nTo give us that information that we want,\nright Ronny?\n\n19\n00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.620\n>> When you start taking\na look at Project,\n\n20\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.310\nremember that even though it kinda gives\nyou that default look that you want.\n\n21\n00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.170\nAnd some of the different ways you can\nwork with the data, being able to get\n\n22\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.660\nthe information out when you need it and\nhow you need it is so important.\n\n23\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.380\nIt's one of kinda the neatest things\nabout project is that you can customize.\n\n24\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.170\nJust about everything you see right\nhere inside your project plan and\n\n25\n00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.490\nthat way you can actually\nfilter out data if you need to.\n\n26\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.690\nYou can change the look of the data,\n\n27\n00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.890\nyou can actually be able to display right\naway what you need, and then later on we\n\n28\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.370\nactually have another episode where we\nactually create reports off that data.\n\n29\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.070\nSo let's go ahead and show you how\nto begin to apply what we call some\n\n30\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.160\nof the different customization\nthat we can, to the views, so\n\n31\n00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.550\nthat we can see exactly\nwhat we want to see.\n\n32\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.480\nSo in my project plan, it's the same\nproject plan we've been working with\n\n33\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.540\nthroughout the entirety of the course,\nwell what we're starting to see of\n\n34\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.160\ncourse is that here it is, by default this\nis what our project plan opens up to.\n\n35\n00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.330\nAnd if we need to see stuff, this is the\nview that we're use to working with cuz we\n\n36\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.920\nspent so much time and energy entering the\ndata in and getting everything working.\n\n37\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.570\nBut remember that there are a lot of\ndifferent ways that we can see the data.\n\n38\n00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.000\nThe default way is right here where we\nactually have everything done by a task.\n\n39\n00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.940\nAnd later on in other episodes we also saw\nwhere we could go to a resource view where\n\n40\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.020\ninstead of actually seeing the task and\nthe resources that are attached to them,\n\n41\n00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.240\nwe could then see the resource and\nthe task that they're attached to.\n\n42\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.580\nAnd we can actually continue to\nmanipulate and see some of those things.\n\n43\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.160\nBut built into Microsoft Project itself\n\n44\n00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.528\nis actually some of the ways we\ncan begin to filter the data.\n\n45\n00:02:29.528 --> 00:02:32.990\nNow I wanna show you this in just\nthe default view right away and\n\n46\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.260\nthen you can say, well,\nthat's not really helpful.\n\n47\n00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.090\nBut if we switch to some\nof the other views,\n\n48\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.850\nit's gonna actually be even more helpful.\n\n49\n00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.180\nWhat they're talking about right here is\nactually what we call the auto filter.\n\n50\n00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.950\nNow if you've worked with Excel and\nbeing able to actually select a column and\n\n51\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.910\nhaving a drop down and being able\nto filter out what you needed to.\n\n52\n00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.440\nWell Project has that\nsame feature in there and\n\n53\n00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.900\nthat's the same as that\nauto filter that's in here.\n\n54\n00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.860\nSo notice that at the top of my chart,\nI of course have these different\n\n55\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.590\ncolumn headers and\nright beside those column headers,\n\n56\n00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.940\nof course, is the little drop\ndown box that we see right away.\n\n57\n00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.560\nAnd if I select one of those,\n\n58\n00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.580\nit doesn't matter which column I pick,\nI can actually select one.\n\n59\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.560\nAnd then, down inside of this list\nnotice everything is checked by default.\n\n60\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.840\nWell, I can go in there and actually\nstart unchecking things if I wanna, so\n\n61\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.740\nlet me say I wanna get rid of this\ndeploying phase and I click OK.\n\n62\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.140\nNow it actually got rid of everything.\n\n63\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.620\nI probably selected the wrong.\n\n64\n00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.450\nI selected everything apparently.\n\n65\n00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.894\nLet me select all again.\n\n66\n00:03:32.894 --> 00:03:34.913\nOh, that's what happened.\n\n67\n00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:36.840\nIt actually scrolled down.\n\n68\n00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.530\nThat was my fault.\n\n69\n00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.900\nLet me just unchecked\nthe deploying phase and\n\n70\n00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.620\nverify that the other\nphases are still checked.\n\n71\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.550\nThere we go.\n\n72\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.850\nSo when I saw that, I was like oh no.\n\n73\n00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:44.950\nI got rid of something.\n\n74\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.130\nBut if I scroll on back up.\n\n75\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.080\nThere we go.\n\n76\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.820\nNow notice that it begins\nat testing phase instead.\n\n77\n00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.090\nThat was just kinda my screen shot the.\n\n78\n00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.870\nThat's what actually kinda\ngot me worried there.\n\n79\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.800\nThat I actually selected something wrong.\n\n80\n00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.210\nSo now I can begin to filter that out.\n\n81\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.370\nNow you might be wondering\nwhy is that important?\n\n82\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.540\nWell I'm completely done\nwith the deploying phase and\n\n83\n00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.730\nall that I'm left with is.\n\n84\n00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.480\nThe tuning phase and I really\ndidn't want to see the other stuff.\n\n85\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.470\nNotice that I can actually start\nmanaging my project from right there and\n\n86\n00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.750\nnot have to worry about\nall the other stuff.\n\n87\n00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.600\nI'm not gonna change any of\nthe other information in there.\n\n88\n00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.610\nSo we can do something like that fairly\neasily in any one of these columns\n\n89\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.590\nthat we have, whether it's actually\nright there or inside of duration, I\n\n90\n00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.290\ncan actually pick all of the duration that\nactually been listed inside of my project.\n\n91\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.210\nOr if I wanted to I could\nactually select that and\n\n92\n00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.090\nthen notice that there are other\nfilters that we can have.\n\n93\n00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.860\nThat have already been predefined as well.\n\n94\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.190\nAnd so these are actually based on well,\nwhat Project will give us.\n\n95\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.180\nNow on this one like I said,\nyou take a look and you go,\n\n96\n00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.250\nwell that's not really super helpful.\n\n97\n00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.070\nIt works, but let me show you from\nlet's say the resource usage instead.\n\n98\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.050\nIf I click on resource usage now,\nand you take a look and\n\n99\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.420\nyou see some of the different resources,\n\n100\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.410\nyou might be wondering what,\nwhy in the world is that important?\n\n101\n00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.410\nWell, what I can do under Resource Name\nis I can click there, and then,\n\n102\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.150\ninstead of actually seeing everything,\nI can go down here and say all right,\n\n103\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.450\nlet me just see what's actually\nworking on installing the cubicles.\n\n104\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.290\nAnd now notice that on the cubicle\ninstaller right here and there it is.\n\n105\n00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.080\nThere's the hours that he's working on and\nhe's focusing on his work and\n\n106\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.210\nthen I need to go ahead and\nscroll to the task so that we can see it.\n\n107\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.960\nIt's showing the current day and\nthat way I can see that on Wednesday\n\n108\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.350\non this date which would be, let's see\nif I can hover over it and find out.\n\n109\n00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.600\nIt was fifth, fourth, third, second.\n\n110\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.680\nThe second here I can see where\nhe's been over allocated and\n\n111\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.030\nhe's working on three tasks as he's\nactually starting to do stuff.\n\n112\n00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.820\nBy then he's scheduled for\n24 hours on that one day.\n\n113\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.780\nAnd that's why he actually did really\nget over allocated pretty harshly there\n\n114\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.920\nwhen we start taking a look.\n\n115\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.720\nSo you can use those auto filters.\n\n116\n00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.910\nVery neatly to really\nfocus in on what you wanna\n\n117\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.200\nsee if you're actually\njust using Auto Filters.\n\n118\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.820\n>> And, this is another one of those\nreasons where you hear a lot of people say\n\n119\n00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.940\nthe project is kinda\nlike Excel on steroids.\n\n120\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.130\nIt really is a mix of Excel and\nMicrosoft Access.\n\n121\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.690\nRight?\nA database on the back end and\n\n122\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.520\na spreadsheet on the front end and\nthe auto filtering comes right from Excel.\n\n123\n00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.120\nIt works the same way as theirs, so\n\n124\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.560\nif you're familiar with it in Excel you're\nfamiliar with it right here in project.\n\n125\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.690\n>> Now that of course is\njust one of the ways that\n\n126\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.210\ncan get us the information very quickly\nespecially if we're trying to filter\n\n127\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.010\n>> A lot of times that's what\n\n128\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.880\nwe're looking at.\n\n129\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.570\nIt could be Don says hey,\nRonny I wanna see all the contractors and\n\n130\n00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.490\nhow much money we've been spending on it.\n\n131\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.270\nWell, being that I actually used to\nauto filter it's probably the easiest\n\n132\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.440\nway to do that.\n\n133\n00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.040\nBut if we wanted to start\ngenerating reports and\n\n134\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.080\nsome different things we might\nactually consider what we call a view.\n\n135\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.930\nRight now, in front of me,\non the Default gant chart that I have.\n\n136\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.230\nWhen project first opens\nup here's the default.\n\n137\n00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.990\nBut notice actually two\ndifferent views right.\n\n138\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.720\nOver here on the left\nhand side I have a table.\n\n139\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.660\nAnd over on the right hand\nside I actually have a chart.\n\n140\n00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.960\nWell that combination of those two\ndifferent elements is what we call a view.\n\n141\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.730\nNow when you start taking a look when you\nselect the view tab, you'll notice that\n\n142\n00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.350\nthey went ahead and set up quite\na few different types of views for\n\n143\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.250\nus, that we can actually see by default.\n\n144\n00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.850\nLet me see if I can show\nyou what I'm talking about.\n\n145\n00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.900\nIf I right click on\nthe little blank box here,\n\n146\n00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.530\nyou can see that there's a cost table.\n\n147\n00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.580\nThere's a bunch of different tables\nthat we're working with on this side.\n\n148\n00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.050\nAnd over here on this side, it will\nstay that gant chart if I choose to.\n\n149\n00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.850\nBut notice that right here you actually\nhave what we call other views.\n\n150\n00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.870\nSo they've already\npre-programmed several of these.\n\n151\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:40.070\nBut If I select other views and\nthen I can go down to more views.\n\n152\n00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.300\nThis will actually be some of the\ndifferent ones that you automatically see,\n\n153\n00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.130\nin other words project has\nalready been set up for us.\n\n154\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:53.251\nBar roll ups, calendars, descriptive\nnetwork diagrams, detailed you name it.\n\n155\n00:07:53.251 --> 00:07:56.762\nThey went ahead, and they've created\na bunch of different views for\n\n156\n00:07:56.762 --> 00:08:00.031\nus automatically, so that if we needed to,\nwe could go ahead and\n\n157\n00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:02.833\nselect another one such as\nthe gant with the timeline.\n\n158\n00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:03.793\nAnd I apply.\n\n159\n00:08:03.793 --> 00:08:04.647\nAnd now notice,\n\n160\n00:08:04.647 --> 00:08:08.501\nwe actually have three separate elements\non my screen at one time, right?\n\n161\n00:08:08.501 --> 00:08:10.361\nThe Gantt chart over on the right,\n\n162\n00:08:10.361 --> 00:08:14.800\nthe entry table over here on the left-hand\nside, and now this timeline.\n\n163\n00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.150\nAnd it's just giving us\nthat customized view or\n\n164\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.990\nthat view that we want the project set up.\n\n165\n00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.623\nNow can you go in there and\ncreate your own view if you want to?\n\n166\n00:08:22.623 --> 00:08:24.201\nYeah, you definitely can.\n\n167\n00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:27.000\nAnd a lot of times to be able\nto do something like that,\n\n168\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.420\nis just as simple as actually kind of\nusing a baseline approach of this too.\n\n169\n00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.700\nSo let's say that here's a view that\nI want, I can click on More Views.\n\n170\n00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:42.160\nAnd from there if I select Gantt with\nTimeline I can make a copy of this view.\n\n171\n00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:49.230\nAnd when I do that, let's say that this is\ngonna be my terminal for TS-TimelineView.\n\n172\n00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.454\nNotice it tells me what's in the primary\nwindow which is normally going to be,\n\n173\n00:08:53.454 --> 00:08:55.187\nof course,\nthe Gantt chart view that I have.\n\n174\n00:08:55.187 --> 00:08:58.357\nBut if I click on that drop down,\nlook at that.\n\n175\n00:08:58.357 --> 00:09:02.990\nI can actually change what I want it to be\non one side and actually have another one.\n\n176\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.480\nSo I can do Network Diagram down here,\nthat would kind of be silly, but\n\n177\n00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.406\nthen I can do some like I don't know.\n\n178\n00:09:09.406 --> 00:09:11.990\n[LAUGH] Hard time deciding now.\n\n179\n00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.194\nDetail Gantt over on the right-hand\nside and show that in the menu.\n\n180\n00:09:15.194 --> 00:09:17.788\nAnd now I've created\nmy own custom view and\n\n181\n00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:21.545\nwhen I select it now you can see\nwhere it's actually changed.\n\n182\n00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:24.885\nAnd this may be the view that I really\nwant to work in all the time cuz these\n\n183\n00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:28.559\nare the elements that I'm constantly\nhaving to go up to View, Change my View,\n\n184\n00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:31.490\ninstead you can actually\ncreate your own to do that.\n\n185\n00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.800\nNow even though you actually\ndo have these views and\n\n186\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.720\nthat More View listed\nin multiple locations,\n\n187\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.840\nit really brings you to the very\nsame location of all those views.\n\n188\n00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.800\nSo you can actually create them and\nthen from any area whether you're actually\n\n189\n00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.400\nin the resource views or in the task view,\nyou'll actually be able to pull that up\n\n190\n00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.510\nand it'll actually pull\neverything together for you.\n\n191\n00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.493\nSo it really is a powerful view for\nus to be able to take and\n\n192\n00:09:52.493 --> 00:09:54.654\nbe able to see that information as well.\n\n193\n00:09:54.654 --> 00:09:55.746\nSo, very neat.\n\n194\n00:09:55.746 --> 00:09:56.265\n>> Yeah, and\n\n195\n00:09:56.265 --> 00:10:00.089\nI know I personally use this because I\ndon't like to modify the default views.\n\n196\n00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:03.418\nSo that default Gantt chart view,\nwhere Project sends you right away and\n\n197\n00:10:03.418 --> 00:10:04.946\neverybody's kind of used to it,\n\n198\n00:10:04.946 --> 00:10:08.184\nI've got this bad habit of wanting\nto add in a bunch of custom columns.\n\n199\n00:10:08.184 --> 00:10:08.858\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n200\n00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.378\n>> And I know we've done it\nthroughout the show, too.\n\n201\n00:10:10.378 --> 00:10:13.072\nYou start creating these custom data\ntypes, and throwing them in there, and\n\n202\n00:10:13.072 --> 00:10:15.110\nreally storing some good information.\n\n203\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.930\nBut what if you wanna go back and\n\n204\n00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.400\njust see the original Gantt\nchart view the way it was?\n\n205\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.998\nInstead of modifying that game chart view,\nI'll just clone it.\n\n206\n00:10:21.998 --> 00:10:25.840\nAnd modify this new clone,\nso it's the way that I want.\n\n207\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.359\nSo I might have the Gantt chart view,\nthat's the default Microsoft one.\n\n208\n00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:31.430\nAnd then I might have\nDon's Gantt chart view,\n\n209\n00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.095\nwhich is the enhanced one that\nI've added my columns to it.\n\n210\n00:10:34.095 --> 00:10:37.730\nI just don't like to mess with\nthe default views if I don't have to.\n\n211\n00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.640\nCreate your own and\nrun with it from there.\n\n212\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.679\nAnd we'll see later on,\nin another episode where we can, or\n\n213\n00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:46.075\nmaybe even in this episode,\nwhere if you really customize a view and\n\n214\n00:10:46.075 --> 00:10:49.188\nget it set up amazing,\nyou can copy it between your projects.\n\n215\n00:10:49.188 --> 00:10:52.416\nAnd not even just templates,\nyou can copy it between existing projects,\n\n216\n00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:53.728\nif you really wanna go crazy.\n\n217\n00:10:53.728 --> 00:10:55.968\nSo you can make Project really work for\nyou.\n\n218\n00:10:55.968 --> 00:10:58.188\n>> Now, Don, since you brought it up,\nlets go ahead and talk about that.\n\n219\n00:10:58.188 --> 00:11:01.650\nCuz it's really kind of\nthe neatest feature that's there.\n\n220\n00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.760\nIf you do know that, hey,\n\n221\n00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.640\nthis is a particular view that I'm\ngonna wanna see between, well,\n\n222\n00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.244\nmultiple projects, whether I'm working on\nthem right now, or even in the future.\n\n223\n00:11:09.244 --> 00:11:12.402\nWell, you can copy that view,\nand be able to do that.\n\n224\n00:11:12.402 --> 00:11:14.268\nAnd so, what Don is talking about,\n\n225\n00:11:14.268 --> 00:11:17.140\nis talking about moving\nsomething with an organizer.\n\n226\n00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.460\nSo, let me show you how\nthat's done right now.\n\n227\n00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.450\nSo, the way to do that is,\n\n228\n00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:25.290\nonce you've created your custom view, you\ncan go back to File, and it's right here.\n\n229\n00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.431\nThis is the one that kinda got me, Don.\n\n230\n00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:29.693\nIn the older versions of this,\nyou had to look for a particular location.\n\n231\n00:11:29.693 --> 00:11:32.282\nNow they actually put it right\nhere at the top in Info.\n\n232\n00:11:32.282 --> 00:11:35.045\nAnd it's in the Organizer right here.\n\n233\n00:11:35.045 --> 00:11:39.014\nSo, notice that over on the right-hand\nside I have my particular project right\n\n234\n00:11:39.014 --> 00:11:40.803\nhere that's actually available.\n\n235\n00:11:40.803 --> 00:11:43.190\nAnd then I have the global template.\n\n236\n00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.150\nSo notice that right here\ninside of my organizer,\n\n237\n00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.310\nI can see the views that I've actually\nbeen using and that's been created for\n\n238\n00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.150\nme automatically, but notice that\nthe global template has so many more.\n\n239\n00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.918\nIt's just not actually gonna\nload everything in for me.\n\n240\n00:11:54.918 --> 00:11:59.037\nBut let's say that what I wanna do was\ntake this one template that I created\n\n241\n00:11:59.037 --> 00:12:01.031\ninside of the terminal server, and\n\n242\n00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:05.030\nthen I'm going to actually select\navailable in that terminal server.\n\n243\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.227\nAnd then if I open up another project,\n\n244\n00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.778\nlet's see if I can open\nup another project.\n\n245\n00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:11.101\nWell I gotta close that out.\n\n246\n00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:14.998\nLet me open up another project, this one\nright here, there is no big project,\n\n247\n00:12:14.998 --> 00:12:17.750\nit's just one that's a sample here.\n\n248\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.610\nI can go to file, and organizer, and\n\n249\n00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:26.110\nfrom here I can select the views that I\nhave inside of my terminal server project.\n\n250\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.419\nAnd notice that my original project here,\nProject1, with just these three.\n\n251\n00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:33.855\nIf I wanted to add in one that I\nhad created and customized myself.\n\n252\n00:12:33.855 --> 00:12:36.189\nSo there is that Gantt with Timeline.\n\n253\n00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:39.938\nI simply copy that over, and\nit says hey it already exists.\n\n254\n00:12:39.938 --> 00:12:42.957\nThat's fine,\nif I had it that's what would happen.\n\n255\n00:12:42.957 --> 00:12:45.205\nNow let me select the Team Planner\nover here and copy that one over.\n\n256\n00:12:45.205 --> 00:12:46.563\nThat will make a little bit more sense.\n\n257\n00:12:46.563 --> 00:12:49.578\nNotice that I've now added\nthat into Project1 and\n\n258\n00:12:49.578 --> 00:12:52.250\nnow we are actually ready to use that.\n\n259\n00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.550\nSo it gives us the ability\nto create it one time and\n\n260\n00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.201\nthen over multiple projects\nbe able to reuse that view.\n\n261\n00:12:57.201 --> 00:13:01.566\nAnd that really can help us save time\ninstead of having to recreate that same\n\n262\n00:13:01.566 --> 00:13:05.258\nview over and over again every\ntime I open up a new project plan.\n\n263\n00:13:05.258 --> 00:13:09.959\nIt is a very neat feature that we\nhave inside of Microsoft Project that\n\n264\n00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:13.454\nreally makes the value\nacross multiple projects.\n\n265\n00:13:13.454 --> 00:13:15.231\n>> Yeah, and it's not just views, right?\n\n266\n00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:18.067\nYou can copy all sorts of different\nelements in between your projects.\n\n267\n00:13:18.067 --> 00:13:20.567\nSo you might be talking to another\nproject manager in your company and\n\n268\n00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:22.694\nthey show you something they\ndid that's really amazing.\n\n269\n00:13:22.694 --> 00:13:25.114\nMaybe they created a report\nthat's really cool or\n\n270\n00:13:25.114 --> 00:13:28.812\nthey changed the project schedule\nnetwork diagram or something like that.\n\n271\n00:13:28.812 --> 00:13:31.899\nAnd you go, man, I'd really like\nto have that in my project.\n\n272\n00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:35.337\nWell, you can just open their project\nfile, open your project file and\n\n273\n00:13:35.337 --> 00:13:37.860\nthen use your organizer and\nmove it right between and\n\n274\n00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.234\nnow you've got a copy of that view and\noff you go.\n\n275\n00:13:40.234 --> 00:13:41.945\nSo really cool to be able to do that and\n\n276\n00:13:41.945 --> 00:13:44.200\nkind of share things\nbetween project files.\n\n277\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.523\n>> Yeah, I didn't really show that but\n\n278\n00:13:45.523 --> 00:13:48.134\nlet's just take a look briefly here\nat what Don's talking about again.\n\n279\n00:13:48.134 --> 00:13:51.690\nSo even though I only focused in on views,\nnotice all of these other tabs and\n\n280\n00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.219\nthat's where Don's going to.\n\n281\n00:13:53.219 --> 00:13:56.664\nAnd we had created that incredible report,\nit's right here,\n\n282\n00:13:56.664 --> 00:13:59.524\nthat we may go ahead and\nsay, all right, inside of my\n\n283\n00:13:59.524 --> 00:14:03.633\nterminal server project I wanna also\nadd in this Overallocated Resource.\n\n284\n00:14:03.633 --> 00:14:08.172\nAnd I can copy that directly over and\nnow inside of my Project1,\n\n285\n00:14:08.172 --> 00:14:11.470\nI will also have access to that as well.\n\n286\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.367\nOther modules, if you're actually in\nthe VBA programming tables, filters,\n\n287\n00:14:14.367 --> 00:14:15.328\ncalendars, you name it.\n\n288\n00:14:15.328 --> 00:14:18.780\nWe can do all of that, and\nget it ready and set up.\n\n289\n00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.540\nIf you're actually doing projects which\nare kinda along the same basis every time,\n\n290\n00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.880\nwell, this may be the way to go that\nreally can help you set up a lot of that\n\n291\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.660\nstuff and not have to reinvent the wheel\nevery time you start a new project.\n\n292\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.941\nSo it is incredibly helpful when you start\ntaking a look at all that information.\n\n293\n00:14:37.554 --> 00:14:41.833\nAll right, so, the next thing that we\nalso want to take a look at here is,\n\n294\n00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:46.695\ntake a look at grouping and filtering our\ndata as well, a little bit differently.\n\n295\n00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:51.675\nSo when we take a look at this, what we're\ngonna do is when we click on view and\n\n296\n00:14:51.675 --> 00:14:54.685\nwe are inside of this data grouping now.\n\n297\n00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.605\nNow when you take a look\nat that data grouping,\n\n298\n00:14:56.605 --> 00:14:59.700\nright now this project,\nit's already got some work done.\n\n299\n00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.684\nIf I click on Project and\nProject Information and\n\n300\n00:15:02.684 --> 00:15:07.486\nI select Statistics, I can go ahead and\nsee that right now the overall duration\n\n301\n00:15:07.486 --> 00:15:12.460\nof this project as completion is about\n59%, 54% of the work has been done.\n\n302\n00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.532\nSo I can see that now what's actually\nhappening of course is that stuff is\n\n303\n00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:17.952\ncoming to a completion.\n\n304\n00:15:17.952 --> 00:15:22.041\nSo, if I now start to actually\ntake a little bit of time,\n\n305\n00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:26.380\nI may want to focus in on\njust the uncompleted tasks.\n\n306\n00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.010\nAnd or, I can actually come down here, and\n\n307\n00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:33.700\nmaybe I want to focus in on these\ncritical path tasks as well.\n\n308\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.120\nInstead of having to change everything\nright away and create a new view,\n\n309\n00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.990\nif you want to you can,\nI can click on View.\n\n310\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:43.240\nAnd inside of this data grouping,\nnotice that I can actually go ahead and\n\n311\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.769\nhighlight some stuff, if I wanted to,\njust to be able to see it right quickly.\n\n312\n00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:50.994\nSo let's say that I wanted to\nfocus in on critical app, okay.\n\n313\n00:15:50.994 --> 00:15:53.759\nWell once I do that I\ncan now scroll down and\n\n314\n00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:57.084\nyou can see it's actually\nshowing me right here.\n\n315\n00:15:57.084 --> 00:16:01.160\nIt just highlighted all of the tasks\nthat I really wanna focus in on without\n\n316\n00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.585\nactually having to adjust anything or\nrecreate a different view if I wanted to.\n\n317\n00:16:05.585 --> 00:16:09.552\nSo, that is something that can really\nhelp us, and they went ahead, and\n\n318\n00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:13.180\nadded in several different ones for\nus to be able to do that.\n\n319\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.440\nI'm going to clear that highlight,\nwhat if I wanted to filter it out.\n\n320\n00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.370\nSo, here's my entire project\nplan that I have up and going.\n\n321\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.660\nI can also select a filter, and do\nthe same thing for critical path, and now,\n\n322\n00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.880\nnotice it actually goes ahead, and\n\n323\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.440\nactually selects, it shows me the last\ntwo task here in the deploying phase.\n\n324\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:35.370\nAnd then, the rest of the tuning phase is\nnow a part of my critical path as well.\n\n325\n00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.380\nSo, we can filter it.\n\n326\n00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.080\nWe can highlight it.\n\n327\n00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.480\nAnd we can do some other things.\n\n328\n00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.000\nNow, if I go down to my resource usage.\n\n329\n00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.650\nLet's talk about what we did, or what I'd\nmentioned a little bit earlier, right now.\n\n330\n00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:51.280\nLet's say that what Don says is, Ronnie,\nI really wanna see us buy contractors.\n\n331\n00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.480\nIn other words,\nI wanna see how they're doing.\n\n332\n00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.600\nWell, I can come up here to this data\ngrouping, and select, resource group.\n\n333\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.990\nAnd when I do that, now, you can see,\n\n334\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.290\nover on the left hand side that has\na highlight on one of these values.\n\n335\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.910\nI'll go ahead and\nbegin to collapse that down.\n\n336\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.000\nThere it is.\n\n337\n00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.840\nBecause I also added in a contractor\ngroup value to the cubicle installer, and\n\n338\n00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.450\nthe carpet installer.\n\n339\n00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.520\nWell, we can now go ahead, and start\ngrouping that information together, and\n\n340\n00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.860\nbeing able to see all that\ninformation right here.\n\n341\n00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.580\nJust based on what I'm asked to present.\n\n342\n00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.780\nSo, it does take a bit of time for\nyou to kind of work with these things, but\n\n343\n00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.890\nonce you get used to working with them,\nbeing able to see the data that quickly,\n\n344\n00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.110\nbeing able to actually\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n345\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.280\nIt is incredibly helpful once\npeople start asking you for\n\n346\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.230\ninformation from your project.\n\n347\n00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:43.850\n>> It's one of those things that in\npractice, sorry, when you're practicing,\n\n348\n00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.510\nthat it's hard to see how this is really\nbeneficial if your project is small.\n\n349\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.900\nBut in practice, in real life application,\nyou start to realize oh,\n\n350\n00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.250\nyour project files, they get big.\n\n351\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.120\nThey have to have a lot of activities,\na lot of resources, and\n\n352\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.710\nhaving ways to filter or reduce that\ninformation is going to be not just nice,\n\n353\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.190\nit's going to be something\nthat's required for\n\n354\n00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.060\nyou to properly be able to\nhandle all of that data.\n\n355\n00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.020\nSo, there's a lot of different ways that\nwe can customize that information, and\n\n356\n00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.260\nget it ready for what we're gonna\nreally need to do in the future,\n\n357\n00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.560\nwhich is getting is ready for\npeople to ask us about that information.\n\n358\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.650\nWe're gonna see in another episode that\neven though we can see it right here,\n\n359\n00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.750\nremember that others are probably\nnot gonna have project on their\n\n360\n00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.960\ncomputer as well.\n\n361\n00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.870\nAnd that way, we can actually take this\ninformation, turn it into reports, and\n\n362\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.600\nalso distribute it later on.\n\n363\n00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.980\nBut being able to take the time to learn,\nand to go through.\n\n364\n00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.280\nAnd figure out what you want to see,\nright?\n\n365\n00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.610\nDon mentioned it before, previously in\nanother episode that the hard part is,\n\n366\n00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.710\nis not getting project to work,\n\n367\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.200\nit's getting project to work\nthe way that you want it to.\n\n368\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.560\nThat's what you're trying to do here\nby learning about these views, and\n\n369\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.220\ncustomizing them, and being able to\nuse those filters, and groupings too.\n\n370\n00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.370\n>> And well, Ronnie, I think that's\na pretty good run down of the quick and\n\n371\n00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.710\neasy to apply\n>> Fly ways of changing our data.\n\n372\n00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.360\nThere's more advanced ways like creating\nreports which I know we mentioned\n\n373\n00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.350\nin the briefest of moments\nduring this segment.\n\n374\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.170\nBut stay tuned because we're\ndefinitely gonna have some episodes on\n\n375\n00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.950\ncreating some reports, and\nother ways to get data out.\n\n376\n00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.010\nHere, what we've seen in this\nepisode are ways that we as project\n\n377\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.990\nmanagers are gonna use to\nfilter the data for us.\n\n378\n00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.160\nBut it's still project management data.\n\n379\n00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.800\nWhich means it's not necessarily suitable\nfor people who aren't project managers.\n\n380\n00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.080\nThey still don't necessarily\nunderstand what that data is, so\n\n381\n00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.520\nwe might need to an extra step of\ninterpreting that data in pie charts.\n\n382\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.190\nRight?\nPictures,\n\n383\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.610\nthings that are easier to understand,\n\n384\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.570\nto be able to distribute out\nto non-project managers.\n\n385\n00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.470\nWe'll see that in an upcoming segment.\n\n386\n00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.030\nBut for right now,\n\n387\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.640\nRonnie is there anything else\nyou wanna throw in on this one?\n\n388\n00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.860\n>> You just gonna work with it.\n\n389\n00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.070\nThere's no for you to go,\nI wonder how I can get that view.\n\n390\n00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.860\nEven if somebody tells you, you're not\ngoing to remember every single step, so\n\n391\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.640\nthe more often that you work with it,\nthe better you're going to be at it, and\n\n392\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.855\nsee exactly what you want to see.\n\n393\n00:19:44.855 --> 00:19:47.260\n>> Alright, well, ladies and\ngentlemen, that is our show.\n\n394\n00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.600\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n395\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.910\nStay tuned, we have more project\nmanagement shows coming up\n\n396\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.740\nwith Microsoft Project 2013, but\nfor now, signing off for IT Pro

00:00:14.150\nAnd welcome back.\n\n4\n00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.842\nTo another episode of\nITProTV I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:18.350\n[INAUDIBLE] Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.080\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.250\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.760\nWe are ready to get started\ninto Microsoft Project and\n\n9\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.692\nlooking at some of the ways we\ncan get the data out of it.\n\n10\n00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:28.840\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> What you're gonna find is your\n\n11\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.120\nproject managers, or you, will have\nMicrosoft Project on your computer but\n\n12\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.900\n>> Everybody else in your company doesn't\n\n13\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.570\nhave it because it's a little expensive,\n\n14\n00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.440\nand we don't necessarily want to\nbuy it for the mailroom clerk.\n\n15\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.100\nBut, there might data that's in\nproject that they need access to.\n\n16\n00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.005\nSo, it's really handy to be able to\ntake data from inside of Project and\n\n17\n00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:51.366\npull it out and stick it in some other\nsoftware that other people might have, and\n\n18\n00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.972\nthen maybe that's Excel, maybe it's Visio,\n\n19\n00:00:53.972 --> 00:00:56.885\nwell odds are they're not\ngonna have Visio either.\n\n20\n00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:58.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It might be email,\n\n21\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.130\nvarious other things that people do have,\nthey have ready access to.\n\n22\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.770\nFortunately, Project\nmakes that pretty easy.\n\n23\n00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.490\nDoesn't it Ronnie?\n\n24\n00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.480\n>> It really does.\n\n25\n00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.020\nIt wants you to actually\nunderstand that hey.\n\n26\n00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.620\nThey understand something too.\n\n27\n00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.570\nThat project is really designed for\nthe person using it.\n\n28\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.020\nBut the data inside of it.\n\n29\n00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.770\nRight, it's not gonna actually be\nable to be distributed very easily.\n\n30\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.700\nExcept for the fact that Project has tried\nto say, look, we want this data to go out\n\n31\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.240\nto the people that are gonna be making the\ndecisions or stakeholders, and everyone.\n\n32\n00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.940\nSo we wanna make it as\neasy as possible and\n\n33\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.645\nby doing so, they went ahead and offered\nus several different ways we can do that.\n\n34\n00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:34.155\nLet's go ahead and take a look at some of\nthem when we start taking a look here.\n\n35\n00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:37.435\nSo when we actually that one of\nthe first episodes that we did,\n\n36\n00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:40.455\nwe talked about the ways that\nwe can build a project plan\n\n37\n00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:44.555\nwas by also importing data in\nfrom other applications as well.\n\n38\n00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:48.095\nAnd one of the ways that they had pointed\nout was the idea of being able to pull it\n\n39\n00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:50.880\nfrom, well, Excel instead.\n\n40\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.970\nSo if I go ahead and make a new\nproject plan you can see right here\n\n41\n00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.380\nthat one of the links that's available\nto me is new from an Excel workbook.\n\n42\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.770\nSo if I select that option, and I have\ninside of my shared folder here on my lab.\n\n43\n00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.280\nI don't know why it defaults to XML\nformat, but mine it defaults there.\n\n44\n00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.860\nIf I now just select all files I can see.\n\n45\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.990\nHere's a sample of some of the stuff\nthat I had inside of Excel.\n\n46\n00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.870\nAnd I can click Open.\n\n47\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.430\nAnd when I do so, it of course, allows me\nto walk it through this Import Wizard.\n\n48\n00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.620\nFrom there I can choose what I'm\ngoing to actually create and map.\n\n49\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.810\nSo, usually, if I'm gonna actually\ngoing to be bringing this in,\n\n50\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.570\nI may not have the same columns.\n\n51\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.220\nI can go ahead and actually create.\n\n52\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.730\nHey, here's what this column inside\nof Excel is gonna match up to,\n\n53\n00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.770\ninside of project.\n\n54\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.670\nSo, I'm just gonna do a new map.\n\n55\n00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.250\nAnd now, it's gonna ask me what I wanna\ndo, whether I'm gonna append or merge.\n\n56\n00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.340\nI'm gonna do this as a new project.\n\n57\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.550\nAnd click Next.\n\n58\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.400\nAnd it's gonna ask what I want\nto bring over if I have it.\n\n59\n00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.850\nSo notice I have Task, I have Resources,\nI may have assignments inside of Excel.\n\n60\n00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.380\nI may not, so\nI may actually have to choose what I want.\n\n61\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.110\nGo ahead and click Next.\n\n62\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.730\nAnd from that point,\n\n63\n00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.560\nit's asking me what the source of\nmy worksheet name is gonna be.\n\n64\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.499\nIt's gonna be Tasks.\n\n65\n00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.230\nAnd then, all I do is I come down here and\nI actually match it to the proper name.\n\n66\n00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.520\nAnd this is the one that always got me,\nbecause the side of Microsoft Project does\n\n67\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.100\nnot attach the name the way that I thought\nit would be, this always Name here.\n\n68\n00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.420\nClick Next, and click Finish.\n\n69\n00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.340\nAnd there it is.\n\n70\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.160\nWe now begin and\nnow I have at least a basic task list\n\n71\n00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.790\nthat I can have ready to go and\nbe able to bring that into Excel.\n\n72\n00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.840\nBut that's not what we're\ntalking about today, right?\n\n73\n00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.150\nYou're probably saying, well Ronnie,\nwhy'd you bring us through that?\n\n74\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.310\nWell that's part of what\nwe have to understand,\n\n75\n00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.970\nis that if we can import it in\nthere we can also export it too.\n\n76\n00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.620\nAnd the export's just as\neasy if go back to File, and\n\n77\n00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.400\nI select Save As, and I'm just gonna\nbring it into my Documents folder.\n\n78\n00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.870\nAnd instead, I can click on the drop-down\nbox that will allow me to say, hey,\n\n79\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.940\nwhat type am I actually saving it?\n\n80\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.290\nAnd notice it gives me\nseveral different options.\n\n81\n00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.370\nPrevious version of project, but\nnotice I have Excel WorkBooks and\n\n82\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.950\nI can even say it has CSV files for\nimported to other database programs.\n\n83\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.760\nBut let's just do this as\nan Excel WorkBook, and then I can save it.\n\n84\n00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.010\nAnd when I do this in a moment, notice,\n\n85\n00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.170\nhey look at that it's\nactually the same thing.\n\n86\n00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.200\nIt brings me through that Export Wizard.\n\n87\n00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.510\nSo, it's a little bit different.\n\n88\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.220\nIt's not what we normally think as,\nokay, just automatically saves it.\n\n89\n00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.200\nIt actually allows me to now take\nthose options and do the same thing.\n\n90\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.865\nDo I want the entire project Excel\ntemplate that they already have ready or\n\n91\n00:04:33.865 --> 00:04:37.695\nI can do selected data and\nI just continue to follow it through and\n\n92\n00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:42.215\nit will go ahead and finish up for me and\noh, it says my filter can't be found, so\n\n93\n00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:44.195\nI did something a little different there.\n\n94\n00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:47.735\n>> Yeah, so Ronnie, I've had to mess\nwith this one more than I care to.\n\n95\n00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:50.515\nThat default template of grabbing\nthe whole project, you'll find\n\n96\n00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:53.405\nthere's a lot of stuff in project that\nisn't quite compatible with Excel.\n\n97\n00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:54.765\nAnd so you'll get little messages.\n\n98\n00:04:54.765 --> 00:04:58.600\nThat error message you're getting right\nthere is actually because of the project\n\n99\n00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.770\nroll up task.\n\n100\n00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.368\nSo the way I normally use it is by\nhighlighting particular pieces of data.\n\n101\n00:05:03.368 --> 00:05:06.120\nAnd if you notice on the wizard it gave\nRonnie that option to export the whole\n\n102\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.610\nproject, which I find\nis pretty problematic.\n\n103\n00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.350\nOr to select the data.\n\n104\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.830\nSo normally what happens is I'll have some\n\n105\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.530\ncompany that I'm gonna be sub-contracting\nout some of the activities to.\n\n106\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.540\nAnd so I might just highlight the\nactivities I want them to deal with, and\n\n107\n00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.980\nthen I go and I run this wizard and\n\n108\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.380\nI choose just the Selected Data, and\nit's just gonna export those activities.\n\n109\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.680\nOr the resources that I've highlighted,\nor whatever.\n\n110\n00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.210\nAnd that really helps to avoid a lot\nof the errors that come out of that.\n\n111\n00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.820\nBut it can be a little sensitive and\nfinicky.\n\n112\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.246\nAnother way, the cheating way, to quickly\nget data in Excel is you can highlight\n\n113\n00:05:38.246 --> 00:05:42.300\ndata in Project, you can just copy and\npaste it right into Excel too.\n\n114\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.810\nThat's a lot faster even in\nsome cases to do it that way.\n\n115\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.650\nSo it's really up to you, but at the end\nof the day the user interface in Project\n\n116\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.920\nis really built off of\nthe same framework as Excel.\n\n117\n00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.080\nSo they're pretty compatible and\nyou'll find it's a quick and\n\n118\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.720\neasy way to get that data out.\n\n119\n00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.260\nIt in the software that\nother people do have.\n\n120\n00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.800\n>> So\nthere's multiple ways we can do that.\n\n121\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.940\nBut Excel is one of the ways that they\nreally do recommend that you know how\n\n122\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.800\nto be able to get access to, and\nbe able to get the data out of\n\n123\n00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.490\nproject when you're actually ready for\nit to come out to do that as well.\n\n124\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.370\nNow, the other thing that we can also\ndo is that inside of our project plan,\n\n125\n00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.270\nthere may be actual documents that\nwe wanna keep track of as well.\n\n126\n00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.780\nAnd you might be wondering like,\nwell why would I need to do that.\n\n127\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.420\nWell sometimes you do have other\ninformation that's available for\n\n128\n00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.750\nyou inside of a project.\n\n129\n00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.430\nBut yes it's actually in a document\nformat such as a PDF or Notepad,\n\n130\n00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.210\ntext document of some sort.\n\n131\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.290\nAnd you wanna actually be able to know,\nhey, where is that normally linked?\n\n132\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.330\nSo it might be something like this.\n\n133\n00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.840\nOkay?\nSo, let's say that 3.1.\n\n134\n00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.760\nAfter we finish the tuning phase of\nmy project, what ended up happening\n\n135\n00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.680\nis that at some point here, somebody said,\nhey look when we pulled up everything and\n\n136\n00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.690\nwe were ready to install these cubicles,\nwe looked at the carpet, it was terrible.\n\n137\n00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.170\nSo, we wanted to pull that out and\nput new carpet in.\n\n138\n00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.220\nWe added in a new task.\n\n139\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.330\nWell, I may actually go ahead and\n\n140\n00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.660\nhave something that was a sheet that\nsomebody actually sent to me saying,\n\n141\n00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.590\nhere's what we're adding in, and\nhere's the authorization to do that.\n\n142\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.800\nBut we can simply link this task then to\nbe able to do something like that as well.\n\n143\n00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.820\nIf I right click on this task,\nI can select a Hyperlink.\n\n144\n00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.080\nAnd when I do that I can link it to well,\nwhere my document may be.\n\n145\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.570\nLet's say it's actually just\na project formulas here.\n\n146\n00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.240\nAnd I click OK.\n\n147\n00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.620\nAnd then if I now aren't\nable to select that,\n\n148\n00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.880\nit should actually say hey here it is.\n\n149\n00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.560\nThere's a potential security concern.\n\n150\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.640\nThere's no security concern on this one,\nand\n\n151\n00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.400\nI can bring that information up just\nabout immediately to be able to see that.\n\n152\n00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.240\nSo, we can link it there, and\n\n153\n00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.300\nif I actually had a regular\nURL that we can go to.\n\n154\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.700\nIf there's a website we wanted to go to,\nwe could also do that as well and\n\n155\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.280\njust have that show up.\n\n156\n00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.820\nDo you know to add that in, it gives me\na nice little visual reminder that I can\n\n157\n00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.790\ninclude in other information that's\nnot really directly in project itself?\n\n158\n00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.000\nBut I can have it right there and\nready to go if I need to.\n\n159\n00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.060\n>> Yeah, that's a neat way to get\nlittle things linked in there, and\n\n160\n00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.000\nit is normally gonna be when this\nis just some kind of Pointer to,\n\n161\n00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.700\nsometimes you'll see where their pointers\ndo on external calendaring system or\n\n162\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.100\nsome kind of event page or whatever.\n\n163\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.530\nBut Ronnie, what if we've got\nsomething a little bit different?\n\n164\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.990\nWhat if, for example,\nif you're managing a project out there and\n\n165\n00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.370\nyou're gonna generate a lot of\nsupporting documents as you go, right?\n\n166\n00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.420\nSo using your example there, the carpet we\nprobably had to get a quote from somebody,\n\n167\n00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.010\nso we probably have something\nlike a PDF that's a quote.\n\n168\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.990\nOr we might get a change ticket, right?\n\n169\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.980\nWe fill out the change request form, and\nwe get that approved and signed off,\n\n170\n00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.200\nand And maybe that's a PDF or an XPS,\n\n171\n00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.900\nmaybe it's a Word document, and\nI want to keep track of these.\n\n172\n00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.130\nWell, when you do a link like you just\ndid, the link is pointing to some\n\n173\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.470\nexternal location, and\nwe can only have one link, right.\n\n174\n00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.830\nWell, what if I want to link to three or\nfour different documents?\n\n175\n00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.500\nWhat if I don't want it to be external,\nright?\n\n176\n00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.620\nWhat if that link changes?\n\n177\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.290\nI want these documents to\nbecome part of the project.\n\n178\n00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.170\nIs there a way we can do that?\n\n179\n00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:02.250\nIf we go ahead and, let me see if I\ncan do this here, right-click and\n\n180\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.090\ngo to the information.\n\n181\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.480\nAnd it is-\n>> It's right under Notes.\n\n182\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.340\n>> Yep, the notes, yeah, that's right.\n\n183\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.490\n>> We kind of went into this a little bit\nearlier where you've got this notes field\n\n184\n00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.250\nwhere you can punch in whatever you want,\nright.\n\n185\n00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.920\nYou can punch in just data.\n\n186\n00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.250\nYou type it in there and that's great.\n\n187\n00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.620\nBut what a lot of people don't realize\nis you can, I call it smuggling.\n\n188\n00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.180\nYou can smuggle documents in here and\n\n189\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:32.255\nI love to do this because if you're got\na whole collection of PDFs Can XPS and\n\n190\n00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:35.565\nall these other documents\nthat are laying around, well\n\n191\n00:09:35.565 --> 00:09:40.375\nif you copy your project file to another\nlocation, those links might break, right.\n\n192\n00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:43.425\nOr maybe you've got to remember to\ncopy all these other files with it.\n\n193\n00:09:43.425 --> 00:09:48.775\nIf you're trying to create one big massive\nproject file that has everything you want,\n\n194\n00:09:48.775 --> 00:09:50.855\nyou can actually use these\nnotes fields to do it.\n\n195\n00:09:50.855 --> 00:09:55.240\nSo Ronny's just typing in a little note\nthere right, but when he goes in there,\n\n196\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.410\nyou'll see where you can start to add\nin objects, this insert object field.\n\n197\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.380\nAnd you can do it this way where you\nnavigate through and pick the types,\n\n198\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.760\nbut the way I normally do it, you can just\ndrag and drop a document right in there.\n\n199\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.625\nSo, Ronnie, take like one of those those\nExcel documents you had earlier or\n\n200\n00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:10.725\nreally anything.\n\n201\n00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:13.745\nPDF Xps I do text files mark\ndown it doesn't really matter.\n\n202\n00:10:13.745 --> 00:10:16.475\nYou can drag them and drop them and\nsee what it just did?\n\n203\n00:10:16.475 --> 00:10:18.735\nIt's basically linked\ninto that activity now.\n\n204\n00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:20.385\nAnd so\nyou can double click on that activity and\n\n205\n00:10:20.385 --> 00:10:22.135\ngo into the notes tab and what do you see?\n\n206\n00:10:22.135 --> 00:10:26.035\nYou see the quote that you got\nthe change ticket that was approved.\n\n207\n00:10:26.035 --> 00:10:28.025\nAny status reports that people submitted.\n\n208\n00:10:28.025 --> 00:10:30.045\nYou can stick them there and\n\n209\n00:10:30.045 --> 00:10:33.990\nthen when that activity is behind\nyou double-click on the activity.\n\n210\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.290\nYou go to notes and there's all\nthe supporting documents right there.\n\n211\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.185\nNow one word of caution.\n\n212\n00:10:38.185 --> 00:10:40.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The more data you put in there,\n\n213\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.280\nthe bigger your project file gets.\n\n214\n00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.500\nIt's storing data.\n\n215\n00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.130\nSo your project file is gonna grow and\ngrow and grow.\n\n216\n00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:50.370\nNow it's not gonna take up any more\ndisc space then it did before, right?\n\n217\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.130\nIf the supporting documents are in the\nproject file or outside the project file\n\n218\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.110\nthey're still gonna take up space, but\nwhat it does do is it can slow down\n\n219\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:01.590\na little bit the launching of project or\nopening up of an activity.\n\n220\n00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.140\nSo if you go crazy and\n\n221\n00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.490\nstart putting images of DVDs and\nfull video files in there,\n\n222\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.600\nit'll let you do it but your project\nfile can really swell to be massive.\n\n223\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.730\nSo I usually try and\nlimit this to PDFs, documents,\n\n224\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.910\nmaybe some images, but I just don't\nwant to go too crazy on the file sizes.\n\n225\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:19.750\nThere actually,\n\n226\n00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.580\nI don't think there's a true limit to the\nsize of files that you can stick in there.\n\n227\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.360\nBut I normally try to keep it to files\nunder like, four or five megabytes if\n\n228\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.350\nI can, which is really plenty of size for\nmost images and documents.\n\n229\n00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.720\n>> And a lot of times,\nin the earlier versions,\n\n230\n00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.040\nyou actually just had where it gave\nyou an insert object out here on this\n\n231\n00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.810\nshortcut menu\n>> So, actually having it in links.\n\n232\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.680\nI think the notice has always\nbeen there as far as I know.\n\n233\n00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.170\nBut I did not know about dragging and\ndropping it directly into that field.\n\n234\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:46.820\nI did not know.\n\n235\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.991\n>> That's my shortcut wave.\n\n236\n00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:50.101\n[LAUGH] The way you were\nshowing the answer.\n\n237\n00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:51.044\nThat works great, but.\n\n238\n00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.025\n>> You want a.\n>> Ahead of time.\n\n239\n00:11:52.025 --> 00:11:54.535\n>> The reason I always have a problem\nthere, it is one at a time, and\n\n240\n00:11:54.535 --> 00:11:56.945\nyou have to pick the type of data first.\n\n241\n00:11:56.945 --> 00:11:59.865\nAnd it's kind of unnecessary\ncuz Project doesn't\n\n242\n00:11:59.865 --> 00:12:01.475\nreally care what the type of data is.\n\n243\n00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:03.385\nI don't really know why it even asks for\nthat.\n\n244\n00:12:03.385 --> 00:12:05.395\nSo that's why I usually\njust do the drag and drop.\n\n245\n00:12:05.395 --> 00:12:08.135\nBut it's cool to get it linked\nright there into the project file.\n\n246\n00:12:08.135 --> 00:12:10.235\nAnd now it's just there.\n\n247\n00:12:10.235 --> 00:12:11.615\nIt's part of the project.\n\n248\n00:12:11.615 --> 00:12:13.325\nSo at the end of the day\nwhen your project's over,\n\n249\n00:12:13.325 --> 00:12:18.620\nit's completed Your project file is now\nthis, like, giant wealth of data, right?\n\n250\n00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.200\nIt's all of the,\nthe when we do our lessons learned, and\n\n251\n00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.040\nall that other information.\n\n252\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.350\nIt's all right there in\nthe project archive.\n\n253\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.490\n>> The other type of information that\nwe normally want to get out of this is,\n\n254\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:33.110\nsomebody's normally saying how far\nalong are you in your project plan?\n\n255\n00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.290\nIn other words we don't really want to\nsee all the details, all the tasks, and\n\n256\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.530\nall the resources.\n\n257\n00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.840\nWe just really want a nice little\ngraphical representation of\n\n258\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.010\nhow far along you are or\nwhere are things actually heading.\n\n259\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.610\nFor your project plan, and so\n\n260\n00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.210\nwe're actually going to a feature\nthat Don loves to no end.\n\n261\n00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.082\n>> I do.\n>> Which is called the Project Timeline.\n\n262\n00:12:51.082 --> 00:12:54.850\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So the Project Timeline\n\n263\n00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.290\nwas a new feature introduced in Project\n2010 and now we're in Project 2013.\n\n264\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.492\nWe joke about it,\nI think it's It's kind of pointless, but-\n\n265\n00:13:02.492 --> 00:13:03.256\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n266\n00:13:03.256 -->

use.\n\n269\n00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.890\nAnd when you go into a project,\nwhat do you see by default?\n\n270\n00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.390\nA Gantt chart.\n\n271\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.380\n>> A Gantt chart.\n>> All right, so\n\n272\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.180\nI get the information that I need.\n\n273\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.360\nBut if you're not a project manager,\nyou're not used to Gantt charts,\n\n274\n00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.280\nyou're used to calendars, right.\n\n275\n00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.080\nI wanna see calendars.\n\n276\n00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.950\nI wanna see what's going on and\nhow long it takes and\n\n277\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.090\nI want it stretched across calendars.\n\n278\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.750\nWhat we wanna see well, we have\ncalendar views inside our project but\n\n279\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.360\nthe calendar views aren't\nparticularly good because\n\n280\n00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.790\nthey're somewhat limited in how many\nactivities they control in the same day.\n\n281\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.830\nIf you have 20 activities on the same day\nthe calendar view just cannot render that.\n\n282\n00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.580\nThere's no good way to render\nthat on the calendar view.\n\n283\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.930\nBut the timeline view\n\n284\n00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.200\nseeks to give us a way to be able\nto see that a little more clearly.\n\n285\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.580\nAnd to be able to collapse and expand\ntasks in a visually pleasing method that\n\n286\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.740\nin my opinion to a project\nmanager completely useless.\n\n287\n00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.411\nBut to other people.\n\n288\n00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:54.640\n[LAUGH]\n>> Somebody else will.\n\n289\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.590\n>> Other people in your company\nwill find it very valuable.\n\n290\n00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.960\nAnd I've seen people where\nthey take these timelines.\n\n291\n00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.820\nAnd they print them out\non giant plotter paper.\n\n292\n00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.250\nAnd stick them on the wall.\n\n293\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.230\nAnd it's a great visual guidance for\nemployees.\n\n294\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.729\nSo there is a certain use for this,\nright, I just don't care for them.\n\n295\n00:14:07.729 --> 00:14:08.450\n[LAUGH]\n>> And a lot of\n\n296\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.230\ntimes people just wanna see this and\nwhat they're expecting, of course,\n\n297\n00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.470\nis that you're gonna send it to them,\nusually by email.\n\n298\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.450\nSo we wanna show you how to be able\nto do something like that as well.\n\n299\n00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.030\nIf you're working as a project manager,\nyou're probably not gonna spend time and\n\n300\n00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.630\ngo, all right I've just printed out\nthe gant chart cuz they'll probably say,\n\n301\n00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.210\nI don't know what this is showing me.\n\n302\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.730\nI can kind of figure it out.\n\n303\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.410\nBut something's just that simple\nvisual reminder is the way to go.\n\n304\n00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.290\nSo the way that we do that\nis now if I select View,\n\n305\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.540\nnotice I have the Split View over here on\nthe right-hand side, if I go ahead and\n\n306\n00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.630\nselect Timeline,\nit adds in a timeline for me at the top.\n\n307\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.890\nThat I can actually see.\n\n308\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.690\nAnd notice it says add task\nwith dates into the timeline.\n\n309\n00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.060\nSo what I can do is,\nI might actually be taking a look here,\n\n310\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.100\nand looks like I moved some\ndifferent things around.\n\n311\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.270\nBut let me go ahead and\nright-click on that task and\n\n312\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.280\nnotice I have the option\nto add to the timeline.\n\n313\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.410\nAnd so I'm simply adding in just a few of\nthese events into the timeline itself.\n\n314\n00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.560\nI really did kind of mess some of this\nstuff up when I closed it out here.\n\n315\n00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.950\nAnd when you take a look at our timeline\noverall, you can see the different phases.\n\n316\n00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.550\nYou can even change\nthe color if you want to.\n\n317\n00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.560\nIf I can actually figure out where\nto change the color right here.\n\n318\n00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.340\nYeah, two.\n\n319\n00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:28.620\nSo it should be under Format and\nthen the Deploying Phase.\n\n320\n00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.560\nAnd let's in, let's see,\nsome of these Phase Completes and\n\n321\n00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.700\njust adding in just\na couple of other things.\n\n322\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.330\nAnd when you start adding\nin information like that,\n\n323\n00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.980\nit might show you just enough for\nwhat theat person is looking for.\n\n324\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.040\nThe nice thing is, once you have\nall the information that you want,\n\n325\n00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.020\nI can right-click and\nI can copy the timeline.\n\n326\n00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.560\nAnd Don,\nit actually gives me three options here.\n\n327\n00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.590\nI can do one for email.\n\n328\n00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.560\nI can actually go ahead and\nsay I'm gonna presentation.\n\n329\n00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.330\nAnd that's what I wanna make.\n\n330\n00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.300\nWell let's just do it for an e-mail.\n\n331\n00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.520\nSo I've copied it, and all I have to do is\ngo down to an open e-mail at this point,\n\n332\n00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.190\nand I can paste it in.\n\n333\n00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.630\nAnd from there it's really tiny but,\nlet's see if I can.\n\n334\n00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.360\n>> Well that's the challenge\nwe have right?\n\n335\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.610\nEven with presentation, and\n\n336\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.680\npresentation I mean that you're gonna\nbe taking this PowerPoint right?\n\n337\n00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.000\nAnd so, in those scaling this down and\nit's gonna be fairly small.\n\n338\n00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.800\nThere was that full size option,\nthat one's suitable for printing.\n\n339\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.470\nIf you're gonna be printing it out\nyou want that full size version but\n\n340\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.920\nif you're going via email,\nif you're going via PowerPoint\n\n341\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.670\nyou need to be really selective\nin the tasks you highlight.\n\n342\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:31.090\nAnd so you use that green box to shrink or\nexpand the amount of space your exporting,\n\n343\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.930\nto try to make a little\nmore easier to read, but\n\n344\n00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.275\nat the end of the day\nit's still challenging.\n\n345\n00:16:36.275 --> 00:16:39.955\nBut the advantage here over\nthe calendar view is that if it's\n\n346\n00:16:39.955 --> 00:16:43.685\nreally small you can start eliminating\nactivities from that timeline so\n\n347\n00:16:43.685 --> 00:16:45.885\nthat you've just got\nthe activities you want and\n\n348\n00:16:45.885 --> 00:16:48.630\nthat usually makes it much easier to\nread and much easier to interpret.\n\n349\n00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:52.010\nPeople would start to see that timeline\nand if there's overlapping, yeah,\n\n350\n00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.770\njust add it into overlapping activity.\n\n351\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.870\nWe can very clearly see that\nto know it's happening,\n\n352\n00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.270\nalthough it's small enough, you'll see\nwhere it had to take the note for it and\n\n353\n00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.110\nstick it outside of the activity\nto make room for it.\n\n354\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:05.500\nThat's what the timeline is all about.\n\n355\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.050\nJust kinda showing that and\nmaking sure that we're aware, right.\n\n356\n00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.840\n>> Yeah,\ngetting the information out there.\n\n357\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.670\nSomebody just looks at it and goes hey,\nthis is what I really needed to see.\n\n358\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.130\nAnd then, if they have more questions, of\ncourse you can change and customize that\n\n359\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.820\nand present to them additional\ninformation as you also need to.\n\n360\n00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.420\nSo another way to get project information\nout to someone that may not have\n\n361\n00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.599\nproject on their computers.\n\n362\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.810\nAlthough I will say, any time I start\na new project, I launch Microsoft Project.\n\n363\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.130\nOne of the first things I do, usually even\nbefore I go to the project information\n\n364\n00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.409\nscreen is right-click\nUncheck Show Timeline.\n\n365\n00:17:37.409 --> 00:17:39.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not a big fan of it.\n\n366\n00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.190\nAnd the reason is we'll see there's\nactually other things that we can do too.\n\n367\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.110\nRonnie are we getting into\nreporting in this episode?\n\n368\n00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.960\n>> Actually that's another\nepisode that's coming up.\n\n369\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.730\n>> Oh it's another episode.\n\n370\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.630\nAll right, what we are gonna see some\nreports later on in another episode where\n\n371\n00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.880\nif I have an employee who needs to know\nwhat's coming up I can generate for\n\n372\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.482\nthem a report that has a list of\ntheir activities and what dates and\n\n373\n00:17:58.482 --> 00:18:04.300\nit's not a pretty little graphic its just\na list, but that's usually more practical.\n\n374\n00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.360\nOr, if you've got something like,\nwell, if you really want to go crazy,\n\n375\n00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.190\nif you have Microsoft Project Server, you\ncan have it all tied into their calendar.\n\n376\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.825\nSo, if they're running Microsoft Outlook,\nyou have Exchange and Change calendar.\n\n377\n00:18:15.825 --> 00:18:18.385\nIt can create tasks\nright in their calendar.\n\n378\n00:18:18.385 --> 00:18:20.595\nSo there's plenty of ways to\nget by without the timeline.\n\n379\n00:18:20.595 --> 00:18:24.615\nBut if you like the timeline, it's nice\nthat it's super easy to export that,\n\n380\n00:18:24.615 --> 00:18:27.005\nsend it over to other applications,\nprint it out or whatever.\n\n381\n00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:30.430\nJust remember The full-size\noption is the only one that\n\n382\n00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:35.250\ngives you the high resolution, really\ngood one that's suitable for printing.\n\n383\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.700\nThe other two are really just designed to\nbe smaller and sometimes end up unlegible.\n\n384\n00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.730\n>> The option that we have left here is to\ntake a look specifically about the idea of\n\n385\n00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:50.720\ngetting some data out into Excel again, so\n>> Not just the entire\n\n386\n00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.170\nproject plan itself,\nthe selected data, but\n\n387\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.170\nwe're actually now talking about visual\nreports is what we're talking about.\n\n388\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.840\nAnd when it's not talking about\nvisual data, especially with Excel,\n\n389\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.140\nwe're normally talking about pie charts,\nbar charts, charts, whatever.\n\n390\n00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.150\nWhatever end there that you want, there's\na ton of charts that are available.\n\n391\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.180\n>> And visual reports,\nthat's another feature that was introduced\n\n392\n00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.480\nback in Project 2010\n>> Where I'm not a big fan of\n\n393\n00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.650\nthe timeline,\nI am a big fan of the visual reports,\n\n394\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.730\nbecause we've always known we could take\nour project data and export it to Excel,\n\n395\n00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.260\nor we could take our project data and\nexport it to Visio.\n\n396\n00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:24.240\nBut once it was in Excel or Visio, you\nhad to go through a lot of work to create\n\n397\n00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.630\npivot tables that generated pie charts,\nor network diagrams inside of Visio.\n\n398\n00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.140\nIt took a lot of work to do that.\n\n399\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.540\nSo what Microsoft did, is they created a\nseries of what are effectively templates.\n\n400\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.120\nNot Project templates.\n\n401\n00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.350\nThey created Excel templates,\nand Visio templates.\n\n402\n00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.200\nAnd we can export our\nProject data into those and\n\n403\n00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.260\nit'll create these really\nsuper sweet reports.\n\n404\n00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.680\nAnd we have to do very little work.\n\n405\n00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.630\nAnd so those are the visual\nreports I think they're awesome.\n\n406\n00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.800\n>> They are really neat.\n\n407\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.090\nAnd they really do.\n\n408\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.670\nThey try to take Project and figure out\nwhat are people generally going to need to\n\n409\n00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.240\nsee, and create those templates.\n\n410\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.100\nAnd they're already in here by default.\n\n411\n00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.530\nSo the way to get access to that,\n\n412\n00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.890\neven though we said that we're actually\nhaving another show on reporting, we do.\n\n413\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.110\nHere in this episode we're gonna\ntake a look at doing visual reports.\n\n414\n00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.560\nso I'm gonna select report, and\nnotice at the very end there,\n\n415\n00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.050\nit talks about an export grouping.\n\n416\n00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.390\nIt says visual reports.\n\n417\n00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:17.380\nIf I select that, you can see where it\nactually says the report templates that\n\n418\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.940\nare actually normally created in Excel and\neven Microsoft Visio.\n\n419\n00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.600\nAnd you do have Visio, and\n\n420\n00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.600\nyou want to export your reports\nin that way, you perfectly can.\n\n421\n00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:31.100\nThey love for you to do that More than\nlikely in most production environments,\n\n422\n00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.980\nyou're probably going to be\nExcel is probably going to\n\n423\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.640\nbe the bigger coverage area that you'll\nhave as far as exporting these reports.\n\n424\n00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.650\n>> Yeah, there's some data that\ndoesn't work very well in Excel.\n\n425\n00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.150\nAnd a great example is the project\nschedule network diagram, right.\n\n426\n00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.900\nIf you've got a bunch of activities\narranged in a graphical format\n\n427\n00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.150\nExcel doesn't do that.\n\n428\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.130\nSo Vizio is better at it.\n\n429\n00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.700\nBut not many people have Vizio so\nyou might export to Vizio and\n\n430\n00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.200\nthen from there you might generate\na PDF of it and kind of send it along.\n\n431\n00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.140\nThat's a pretty common thing.\n\n432\n00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:04.620\nBut more than likely we're gonna be using\nExcel and in Excel the real power with it\n\n433\n00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.040\nIs this gonna export your data and it's\ngonna do it in a way that's stored for\n\n434\n00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.960\nuse in a pivot table, which means you can\nmanipulate that data to change the report\n\n435\n00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.910\nto meet your needs and\nit gives you a lot of power.\n\n436\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.620\n>> When you take a look at the visual\nreport creation tool that you see,\n\n437\n00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.580\nyou'll notice that they do break it\ndown in these different tabs and\n\n438\n00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.880\nyou can actually edit templates.\n\n439\n00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.030\nYou can create a new\ntemplate if you want to.\n\n440\n00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.960\nYou can do a lot of different things.\n\n441\n00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.000\nAnd they have it broken up by task usage,\nresource usage, assignment.\n\n442\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.960\nYou name it, they have it broken up by\nall these different ones to kind of give\n\n443\n00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.740\nyou a nice little logical grouping.\n\n444\n00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.210\nNormally, by default, it's on this All\ntab which actually displays every single\n\n445\n00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.320\ntemplate that you have ready to go.\n\n446\n00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.480\nFrom this point if you\nwanted to go ahead and\n\n447\n00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.190\nbe able to take a look at\nthe base line work report or\n\n448\n00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.638\ncost reports, you can go ahead and\ndo that by simply selecting off.\n\n449\n00:21:50.638 --> 00:21:55.160\nNow the only that I have to remember is\nthat you have to have the version of,\n\n450\n00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.840\nyou have to have Excel on your\ncomputer is what I should say.\n\n451\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.620\nNow one thing that I did run into Dona,\nI didn't think about when I started to do\n\n452\n00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.750\nthis, is you can't have\nthe different Platform.\n\n453\n00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.120\nSo I have the 32 bit edition\nof Microsoft Project on here,\n\n454\n00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.190\nI tried to install the 64 bit\nedition of Office on there and\n\n455\n00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.620\nI tried to use this and\nI said no that's not going to work.\n\n456\n00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.620\nThis, yeah, your 32 bit edition\nof Project is conflicting\n\n457\n00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.040\nwith the 64 bit edition of Excel.\n\n458\n00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.890\nSo it's, is, not going to work for you.\n\n459\n00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.680\nSo, I, I had to reinstall and\nput the 32-bit edition of Excel on there.\n\n460\n00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.660\nAnd, so once I did that,\nI can select any one of these.\n\n461\n00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.810\nLet me go ahead and select,\nlet's say like the, budget cost report.\n\n462\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.420\nThat's something that I can see.\n\n463\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.940\nAnd then, you can actually zoom that\nreport in, whether you want it over\n\n464\n00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.460\nthe year, the month, the quarter,\nthe weeks, and the day.\n\n465\n00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.460\nand we'll go ahead and\nselect that for you, and\n\n466\n00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.620\nthen all you have to do is click view.\n\n467\n00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:53.180\nFrom that point, it will build that\nreport, and it will open up Excel\n\n468\n00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:58.020\nonce it finishes doing\nwhat it's doing here.\n\n469\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:58.920\n>> What it's doing, and\n\n470\n00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.330\nthe reason it takes a moment, is it's\nbuilding what's called a data queue.\n\n471\n00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:06.510\nIt's exporting the tables that have\nthe relevant data inside a project And\n\n472\n00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.290\nputting them into worksheets\ninside of a spreadsheet or\n\n473\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.170\ninside of a workbook inside of Excel.\n\n474\n00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.220\nSo, it's building that information and\n\n475\n00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.240\nthen it's applying some charts on top\nof it that work with that information.\n\n476\n00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.490\nAnd when it's all said and\ndone, it fires up Excel and\n\n477\n00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.160\nyou're staring at that spreadsheet that\nhas all the information that you need.\n\n478\n00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.860\nNow, you can view the underlying data and\nmodify it, but\n\n479\n00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.590\nthe important thing to remember,\nit's not linked to your project file.\n\n480\n00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.300\nSo, Ronny just generated that report.\n\n481\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.970\nIt exported the data right now,\nwhich is why it was taking a while.\n\n482\n00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.610\nIf he goes and modifies the project file,\nthe Excel file doesn't get updated.\n\n483\n00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.900\nIt's not a live link between them.\n\n484\n00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.270\nAnd the reason they don't do that,\nif you're asking, well, Don,\n\n485\n00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.680\nwhy wouldn't they do a live link?\n\n486\n00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.140\nWell, you might wanna generate these\nreports for certain intervals, right?\n\n487\n00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.540\nMaybe I do it every Friday of each week,\nI generate a report.\n\n488\n00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:55.200\nIf it was a live report,\nit would be constantly overriding itself.\n\n489\n00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.880\nVersus if it's not live, so\nit exports all the data in there.\n\n490\n00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.920\nThe bigger your project,\nthe longer it's gonna take.\n\n491\n00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.800\nBut when it's done, you end up with\nan excel workbook right rodney?.\n\n492\n00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.190\n>> You do.\nOnce you have that, excel workbook,\n\n493\n00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.720\nwhat don was talking about is that you can\nof course not only see the chart that's\n\n494\n00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.590\navailable but also that pivot table\ninformation and from there if you're\n\n495\n00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.210\nused to working with pivot tables, and\nyou're good at working with pivot tables.\n\n496\n00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.850\nThen you can see exactly\nwhat you wanna see.\n\n497\n00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.240\nAnd that is the power behind it.\n\n498\n00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.660\nPeople that are, that might not\never have used object before.\n\n499\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.760\nBut now they can take the data\nthat you're giving them.\n\n500\n00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.540\nAnd they may be a whiz at excel.\n\n501\n00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.720\nAnd be able to just display\nexactly what you wanna see.\n\n502\n00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.950\n>> You know, I gotta admit ryan,\n\n503\n00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.180\nthe first time that I saw\nthis I wasn't very impressed.\n\n504\n00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.310\nI was like, Well, that's kind of lame.\n\n505\n00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.120\nAnd if you look at the chart\non your first tab.\n\n506\n00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.430\nIt should have a little black and white\nbar graph is the one that you picked.\n\n507\n00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.950\nThere are some that are colorful pretty.\n\n508\n00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.470\nBut, so this is a straight up, this is bar\ngraph and then you look at that table, and\n\n509\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.430\nyou're like man it took so\nlong to export that data, and\n\n510\n00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.330\nall it was was this little table,\nbut it is a pivot table.\n\n511\n00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.300\nSo when you look at it, see the blue\nborders that are around the data,\n\n512\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.205\nthat lets me know that we're\nseeing a summary of our data.\n\n513\n00:24:56.205 --> 00:24:59.035\nAnd if ronnie were to go to the right side\nof the screen, and just start checking off\n\n514\n00:24:59.035 --> 00:25:04.005\nall those things, you'll find that\nit's exported a ton of information.\n\n515\n00:25:04.005 --> 00:25:07.075\nIt's just hiding it from us\nbecause it's not relevant\n\n516\n00:25:07.075 --> 00:25:09.085\nto the chart that we're seeing right now.\n\n517\n00:25:09.085 --> 00:25:10.385\nBut the data is there.\n\n518\n00:25:10.385 --> 00:25:14.185\nAnd that means you can go onto\nadd more charts or to customize,\n\n519\n00:25:14.185 --> 00:25:16.995\nthe chart that's in there and get it\nset exactly the way that you want it.\n\n520\n00:25:16.995 --> 00:25:21.840\nNow this was built off of\na template that microsoft created.\n\n521\n00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.190\nIf you're going to be\ncustomizing this stuff\n\n522\n00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.390\nyou can save what your\ncustomization is as a template.\n\n523\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.890\nAnd you can add that in in\nproject to generate it.\n\n524\n00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.330\nAnd ronnie jump back over to visio.\n\n525\n00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.970\nWhen you created that,\nIt actually had the option there to do it,\n\n526\n00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:40.080\nso [CROSSTALK] when you went to generate\nthe visual report, right there.\n\n527\n00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.470\nAnd so you'll see new t emplate up at,\nthe top right or edit template,\n\n528\n00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.650\nmanage template, so you can go in there,\n\n529\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.700\nand you can create a template from\nscratch, which is a terrible idea,\n\n530\n00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.980\ncuz they're really hard or you can edit\na template, create your own copy of it.\n\n531\n00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.660\nThat's the way.\n\n532\n00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.880\nUsually, you'll take an existing one and\nmodify it Or\n\n533\n00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.910\nyou could just manage template to import\none in that was created somewhere else.\n\n534\n00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:04.160\nAnd there's some really impressive\nreports, that are in there that are, well\n\n535\n00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.820\nthey're just outright handy to be able\nto use to be able to convey information.\n\n536\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:13.250\nSo, you might have a project\nstakeholder or your CIO or\n\n537\n00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:18.100\nCEO or somebody like that who wants to\nunderstand where you're at budget wise.\n\n538\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.270\nThey don't wanna see the full cost\nschedule of your project ,They\n\n539\n00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:24.860\njust want to see, here's what your\nbudget is, here's what you spent so far.\n\n540\n00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.360\nAnd they want to make sure that second\none is lower than the first one.\n\n541\n00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.810\nThat's all they care about and so\n\n542\n00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.660\ngiving it to them as a bar graph,\nthat just makes a lot more sense.\n\n543\n00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:36.060\nIt makes information move more freely and\nit leaves less room for error,\n\n544\n00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.150\nfor people interpreting data.\n\n545\n00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.080\nSo, those are the visual reports.\n\n546\n00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.880\nI encourage you guys to experiment around,\nkinda pick through there.\n\n547\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.730\nDefinitely remember what ronnie said.\n\n548\n00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.670\nIf you got the 32 bit version of project,\nyou need the 32 bit version of office.\n\n549\n00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:53.860\nThat's a real problem, because I know\na lot of people out there that have the 64\n\n550\n00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.510\nbit version of windows, and so they say,\nwell, I want the 64 bit version of office.\n\n551\n00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.680\nWell I'll tell you guys,\n\n552\n00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.690\nunless you're working with\nreally massive access databases,\n\n553\n00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.720\nthere's really not a whole lot of reason\nto run the 64 bit version of office.\n\n554\n00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.240\nSo you'll typically wanna stick 32 bit,\nbut if you have 64 bit there\n\n555\n00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.080\nis a 64 bit version of project too,\nyou just need to make sure they match.\n\n556\n00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.230\nThat is important, or\nthis whole thing doesn't work.\n\n557\n00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.175\nSame thing goes for.\n\n558\n00:27:16.175 --> 00:27:16.904\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n559\n00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.670\n>> It's you,\nyou kind of want it to function, so.\n\n560\n00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:22.170\n>> You do.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n561\n00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.090\n>> And, and you hate to,\n\n562\n00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.380\nto come to that point where you go,\n\n563\n00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.250\ndid I just install the wrong version\nof any one of those products?.\n\n564\n00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.090\nAnd then have to come back in.\n\n565\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.390\nFor the show, no big deal, but\nin, on a production environment.\n\n566\n00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.770\nYeah, you may have to wait a few\nmoments before you can actually get,\n\n567\n00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:35.450\nthe right edition on there.\n\n568\n00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:38.810\n>> Yeah, the other thing is,\nwhen you installed project.\n\n569\n00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:40.620\nYou can actually customize\nthe installation.\n\n570\n00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:44.680\nIt is possible whoever installed it\nchose not to install the visual reports.\n\n571\n00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.550\nThat's possible too.\n\n572\n00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:46.340\nThey are just template.\n\n573\n00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.090\nYou can download them.\n\n574\n00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.660\nYou can also readd them after the fact.\n\n575\n00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.490\nYou may see more or\nless and what is on there.\n\n576\n00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:52.590\nI think I see less on mine.\n\n577\n00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.030\nYou saw on your screen Rodney.\n\n578\n00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.640\nBut the other thing is if you don't have\nvizio, you can uncheck that little vizio\n\n579\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.840\ncheckmark, and\nit will hide the vizio reports.\n\n580\n00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.840\nYou don't see them.\n\n581\n00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.850\nYou can hide the excel and\nyou won't see those.\n\n582\n00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.210\nDefinitely Makes life\na little bit easier there.\n\n583\n00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.720\nYeah, visual reports very cool,\nvery easy way to get data out and\n\n584\n00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.460\ninto excel or visio.\n\n585\n00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.280\n>> Yeah, it really does seem like that\nproject really did understand that what\n\n586\n00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.430\nwas gonna end up happening is you're gonna\ntake that data and get it out to other\n\n587\n00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:21.390\npeople so, that decisions can be made or\nat least get good reports out of it.\n\n588\n00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.210\n>> Now ronnie mentioned that we were\ngonna reports in another episode.\n\n589\n00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.340\nWe just talked about visual reports.\n\n590\n00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.190\nWell, why did we do that?.\n\n591\n00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:30.290\nWell the visual reports require excel or\nvisio, right?.\n\n592\n00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.170\nThe other reports, the ones we're gonna\ntalk about in an upcoming episode,\n\n593\n00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.610\nare done entirely inside of project.\n\n594\n00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.650\nSo, you don't have to have excel or visio.\n\n595\n00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.850\nYou do if you wanna use\nthose visual reports.\n\n596\n00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.300\nBut if you want the standard\nreports right out of project,\n\n597\n00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.760\nit can actually do that built right in, so\n\n598\n00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.160\nwe're gonna take a look at that in\nanother episode as kind of a big topic.\n\n599\n00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.270\nIt needs its own time, so\nwe'll get a chance to see it then.\n\n600\n00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:54.640\nBut for this episode, Ronny, as far as\nexporting and importing data to excel and\n\n601\n00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.060\nother products,\nI think we've probably covered it.\n\n602\n00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.630\n>> I think we've covered every\npossible way that I know.\n\n603\n00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:00.280\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n604\n00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.870\nThere's probably some that\nyou've actually discovered,\n\n605\n00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:05.480\nthat I don't know about,\nbut overall that is plenty.\n\n606\n00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.710\nIf you can't get the data out im project,\n\n607\n00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:11.900\nsomebody doesn't have it, excel is\nusually almost universal out there.\n\n608\n00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.140\nSo go ahead and\ntake advantage of those tools.\n\n609\n00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.250\n>> And you know I'm glad you mentioned\nthat there might be others out there.\n\n610\n00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.790\nProject does have a plugin system.\n\n611\n00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.760\nThere's third party companies that write\ncustom plugins for project ,that allow it\n\n612\n00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.430\nto share and exchange information with\nsystems like primivera, timerline.\n\n613\n00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.860\nOther software like that,\nso you can import and\n\n614\n00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.250\nexport from other sources if you're\nbuying these third party plugins.\n\n615\n00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.470\nSo, your system may have more power,\nor just using.\n\n616\n00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.580\nAll right well, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's our show for today.\n\n617\n00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.080\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n618\n00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.390\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pazette, I'm Ronnie Long, and\n\n619\n00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.100\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n620\n00:29:47.100 -->

I'm your host\nDon Prezet, back again with this guy Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.070\nRonnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?.\n\n9\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.070\n>> It is going well today, another\nbeautiful day that we get to spend some\n\n10\n00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.020\ntime taking a look at some technology,\nmicrosoft project 2013,\n\n11\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.820\nready to get started.\n\n12\n00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.020\n>> And in this episode we're going\nto be taking a look at some of,\n\n13\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.730\nthe reports that we can\ndo inside of project,\n\n14\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.630\nnow, in watching all of our\nshows you'll know we talk about\n\n15\n00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.890\nvisual reports in another episode\n>> Which are dependent\n\n16\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.670\non microsoft excel and microsoft vision.\n\n17\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.700\nWell, in this episode we're\ntalking about the basic,\n\n18\n00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.410\nI shouldn't call it basic right?.\n\n19\n00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.040\nThe built in reports inside a project\n\n20\n00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.790\nthat don't require a third\nparty software at all.\n\n21\n00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.850\nThey can be generated right from inside\nof project and really have some fun.\n\n22\n00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.740\nAnd we're not just going to tackle that,\n\n23\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.750\nwe've got some other things\nwe want to jump into.\n\n24\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.030\nSo there's a lot of information in here as\nfar as how we can manipulate project and\n\n25\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.630\nget that data out of it.\n\n26\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.960\n>> One of the key features for\nus inside project is,\n\n27\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530\nthe reporting aspect of project itself.\n\n28\n00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.330\nWithout the reporting features, that are\nfound inside of project It will be very\n\n29\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.100\ndifficult to get, the reports that we\nneed out to the people that we need.\n\n30\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.300\nVery much so.\n\n31\n00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.380\nBecause remember that while the rest\nof the world doesn't necessarily have\n\n32\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.500\nmicrosoft project on there, so\neven if you're able to show them,\n\n33\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.220\nthe proper view and the display that you\nwanna show them and the proper filtering,\n\n34\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.360\nThe ability to get that information out\nof project in a report that then can be\n\n35\n00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.590\nprinted or shared or emailed that is\nthe key to what we have available to us.\n\n36\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.940\nNow microsoft has always been\nfairly decent at saying look,\n\n37\n00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.050\nreporting is a gigantic feature of\nwhat project is really about, but\n\n38\n00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.750\nit hasn't always been as intuitive as\nit is in the latest version of project.\n\n39\n00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.280\nTo help us to be able to do the things\nthat we need to inside of project as well.\n\n40\n00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.280\nSo they went ahead and created multiple\ndifferent types of reports for us that we\n\n41\n00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.130\ncan use, and it generates it based on\nthe data that we already have entered in.\n\n42\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.070\nAnd that's really kinda\nthe neat key feature, right?.\n\n43\n00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.090\nIs we're not having to go\nan extra step and going ok now,\n\n44\n00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.430\nI need to recreate a lot of this.\n\n45\n00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.060\nThat actually says here\nare the most common reports that\n\n46\n00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.870\nmost people are gonna need to see right\naway and that not only creates it and\n\n47\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.480\nthen, puts it in a background, but\ngives us a visual way of understanding\n\n48\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.055\nsomething I could use if I was actually\ndoing a presentation on that project, or\n\n49\n00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:28.745\nif I was actually having to send it as\nan email and then somebody were to ask me\n\n50\n00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:32.555\nquestions, I could bring it up\nvery easily to be able see.\n\n51\n00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:33.745\nSo that's what we're taking a look at,\n\n52\n00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:36.295\nis some of the different reports\nthat we have available to us.\n\n53\n00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:40.415\nSo let's go ahead and show you where you\nnormally find these different reports, and\n\n54\n00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:42.620\ntake a look at some of\nthe options that we have.\n\n55\n00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.490\nWell the good thing is project has become,\n\n56\n00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.710\na little bit more\nintuitive over the years.\n\n57\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.280\nSo right at the top they've\nactually lined this up.\n\n58\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.380\nSo notice task resource, oh well,\ndon I don't think I can miss it very\n\n59\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.220\neasily here, it actually says\nreport right here in front of me.\n\n60\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.730\nAnd you can see that here\nare some of the different\n\n61\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.430\noptions that we have available to us.\n\n62\n00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.370\nRight away to be able to take a look at.\n\n63\n00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.420\nNow, one of the things that we want to\ndo a lot of times is just, right away,\n\n64\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.130\nis to be able to do something\nlike what's actually in progress.\n\n65\n00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.260\nSo, notice that it says right there,\nin progress.\n\n66\n00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.000\nAnalyze how your report is, or\nhow your project is going so far.\n\n67\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.500\nNow before we start on reports like this,\nbecause we didn't really generate.\n\n68\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.940\nI wasn't really tracking the project,\nright?.\n\n69\n00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.560\nI had to go in and manually kind of go in\nand said, that I had completed some tasks.\n\n70\n00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.580\nI had worked on it and I had assigned\ndifferent resources to this.\n\n71\n00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.930\nBut if you're actually worked on this and\ndid this live time.\n\n72\n00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.860\nWhat's happening is what\nthe date will follow with you,\n\n73\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.730\nwith what's actually going on.\n\n74\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.946\nBut sometimes it's not.\n\n75\n00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:47.300\nSo for example, since I was modeling\nessentially, I'm gonna go to project and\n\n76\n00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.870\nproject information.\n\n77\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.580\nAnd if I'm doing somewhat\nthe ones that are in progress,\n\n78\n00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.690\nI wanna make sure that I take\na look at this current date.\n\n79\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.450\nWell, my project plan doesn't actually,\nStart until halfway through august so\n\n80\n00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.880\nif I were to generate an in\nprogress report right now,\n\n81\n00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.800\naccording to this current date,\nI wouldn't get any information.\n\n82\n00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.500\nSo, you always want to make sure.\n\n83\n00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.260\nNow normally like I said,\nif you're actually monitoring this in,\n\n84\n00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.360\nyou know in real time as you're doing it,\nyou're probably not gonna worry about it.\n\n85\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.410\nBut if you were doing it like we were\ndoing it, just to see how that works.\n\n86\n00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.080\nI'm gonna go ahead and put us a little bit\nfurther down the project line here, and\n\n87\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.970\nI think the date that I chose,\nwell let's say the 10th,\n\n88\n00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.320\nactually yeah let's do the 10th.\n\n89\n00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.050\n>> And this is the difference of\nbeing in planning versus executing.\n\n90\n00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.370\nSo, when you're in the planning phase your\nproject work hasn't actually started so\n\n91\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.590\nyou've got to change this date.\n\n92\n00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.160\nIf you're executing,\nyour work is already happening, and so\n\n93\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.060\nyou don't have to change the date.\n\n94\n00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.880\nThat's kind of different.\n\n95\n00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.490\n>> Yeah, well, without doing that,\nwhen you run that, well,\n\n96\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.430\nespecially the progress report,\nright, you can see where it's not\n\n97\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.200\nshowing you anything, so\n>> What i'm doing is i'm simulating that\n\n98\n00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.130\ni'm already partway through, my project\nand we do that and the nice thing is\n\n99\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.160\nthat our gant chart starts to fill in\na little bit and we start to see that.\n\n100\n00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.540\nThen I can go back to report and\nI'm going to select the in progress and\n\n101\n00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.690\nthen from this point I can take a look at,\nlet's say my critical tasks and\n\n102\n00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.370\nbe able to see some of the other things,\ntoo.\n\n103\n00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.410\nSo right now, that's the only thing that's\nreally left on my progress at this point.\n\n104\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.210\nAnd notice it gives me a nice little\ngraphic over here that tells me what's\n\n105\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.990\nactually been completed and,\nwhat I have yet to complete.\n\n106\n00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.960\nJust a nice little bar chart that,\nagain, I can easily just see,\n\n107\n00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.100\nI'm a little bit over 50% of my progress.\n\n108\n00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.880\nAnd then if I'm not sure\nwhat that actually means,\n\n109\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.250\nover on the right hand side,\nIt broke it down for me by the task and,\n\n110\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.060\nwhat I would normally\nsee in my gant chart.\n\n111\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.500\nVery handy view right here.\n\n112\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.750\n>> Yeah, and this is a huge improvement\nof the old built in reports,\n\n113\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.790\nwhich were really just microsoft\naccess reports, right?.\n\n114\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.120\nThey were just straight up text and, it\nwas laid out in not a very pretty format.\n\n115\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.430\nThere's still support baked in for\nthat if you like those old reports.\n\n116\n00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.770\nBut the new ones they're,\nwhat's the word I want here, right?.\n\n117\n00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.270\nGlamorous?.\n\n118\n00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.710\n>> They are, by comparison.\n\n119\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.990\n>> They're very pleasing as far\nas looking at them visually.\n\n120\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.790\nThis is something that\nyou can hand to somebody.\n\n121\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.690\nSo when your project stakeholder says,\nhey I need a project status report.\n\n122\n00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.660\nYou could generate, a document\nlike this and ,hand it to them and\n\n123\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.390\nit make sense right?.\n\n124\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.530\nNow think about over allocation\nof a resource, right?.\n\n125\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.080\nSo, I know I can go to\nmy resource usage sheet.\n\n126\n00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.760\nAnd I can pull it up there,\nand it gets laid out.\n\n127\n00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.760\nAnd I see all this work for effort driven\nactivities, and as a project manager,\n\n128\n00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.560\nI know what means.\n\n129\n00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.770\nAnd I need to see the individual hours or\nwhatever.\n\n130\n00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.980\nBut if I want to show that to somebody\nelse, they don't necessarily understand,\n\n131\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.670\nwhat's an effort driven activity,\nwhat's over allocation.\n\n132\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.650\nAnd so we can generate,a nice little chart\nhere to see exactly, which resources\n\n133\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.510\nare over allocated and it kind of lays it\non a timeline in a much simpler format.\n\n134\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.060\nSo that's really the glory of these.\n\n135\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.180\nMicrosoft spent a lot of time improving\nthis, but you know originally, they\n\n136\n00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.410\nimproved by adding the visual reports,\nand they got a lot of feedback from users\n\n137\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.320\nsaying hey microsoft, thank you first\noff the visual reports are really nice.\n\n138\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.650\nBut, our end users don't necessarily have\nexcel or visio, give us something better.\n\n139\n00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.140\nAnd so microsoft came back\nwith this round, and created,\n\n140\n00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.060\nthe newer reporting system that\nronnie is showing you right now.\n\n141\n00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.860\n>> Yeah so the progress is usually the one\nthat you'll probably see most people like\n\n142\n00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.370\nto see, especially when they're in\nthe midst of executing the project.\n\n143\n00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.560\nCuz that way they know, right at\nthe visual glance at, what's happening,\n\n144\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.890\nand what is left to be done.\n\n145\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.290\nAnd when you take a look at this report\noverall, right, the graphic that's here.\n\n146\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.270\nBut notice they're actually combining\na lot of these fields together from\n\n147\n00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.970\ndifferent views as well.\n\n148\n00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.600\nSo, over here on these first three,\nactually these first four columns, right?.\n\n149\n00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.840\nWe saw that inside the Gant chart view.\n\n150\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.090\nBut, then the remaining work and\nthe resource thing.\n\n151\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.010\nWe might have actually also\npulled that from the Gant chart.\n\n152\n00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.520\nBut, we could've pulled it\nin from the resource sheet.\n\n153\n00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.120\nWe could've pulled it in from\na resource usage sheet, as well.\n\n154\n00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.850\nAnd so, here they're showing that, hey,\nwe can combine all this different tables,\n\n155\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.150\nall that information, show it right\nhere in one report and give us the data.\n\n156\n00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.110\nThat we're actually ready\nto be able to see too.\n\n157\n00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.000\nThat is an important part of,\na project and\n\n158\n00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.680\ngetting everything to work\nthe way that we want to.\n\n159\n00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.080\nSo reporting is a handy tool and\nthen go ahead and\n\n160\n00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.730\nyou take a look at some of the other\noptions that we were talking about here.\n\n161\n00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.570\nNotice that because this\nproject is now in progress, and\n\n162\n00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.730\nI have the current date that we want to.\n\n163\n00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.390\nWe can actually go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n164\n00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.680\nSo, Don had mentioned\noverallocated resources.\n\n165\n00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.650\nIf I select that, Don,\nthis is actually very pretty at this point\n\n166\n00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.043\nto be able to see [LAUGH] I know,\nI don't know how else to describe it.\n\n167\n00:08:13.043 --> 00:08:13.936\nIt's beautiful.\n\n168\n00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:17.850\nTo say, Don, I didn't have to go back\nin and recreate this bar chart Or\n\n169\n00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.430\nthis overallocation.\n\n170\n00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.110\nI can see the status and\nthis overallocation and\n\n171\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:27.310\nall of the different individual\nresources that are actually doing this,\n\n172\n00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.140\nbroken down by the day if I need to.\n\n173\n00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.240\nSo, it really is a nice\nvisual reminder of stuff.\n\n174\n00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.790\nNow, you can also change\nthese options as well.\n\n175\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.770\nIf I select let's say overallocation,\n\n176\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:43.350\nnotice it gives me this field list over\nhere on the right hand side And here,\n\n177\n00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.120\nthat you can go ahead and\nstart adding in some of the information.\n\n178\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.970\nSometimes it will balk it you,\nespecially because they went ahead and\n\n179\n00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.960\nsaid look, that field doesn't apply\nto what you're trying to do here.\n\n180\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.510\nSo it might ask you to\nrecreate some things.\n\n181\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:59.130\nYou can, again change and select\nthe different categories You name it.\n\n182\n00:08:59.130 --> 00:08:59.700\nYou can do that.\n\n183\n00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.490\nAnd that actually works on each\none of these little tables\n\n184\n00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.310\nas you start seeing the field over there,\ntoo.\n\n185\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.650\nNow, actually, don't think we\ncan actually see that can we?\n\n186\n00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.660\nMy head's actually covering\na part of that, so, my fault.\n\n187\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.670\n>> Now, keep in mind one of\nthe key differences here between\n\n188\n00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.040\na report\n>> Versus the resource sheet that I\n\n189\n00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.630\nmentioned earlier, or\neven the team planner view.\n\n190\n00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:26.120\nHere, we get a really nice, easy view to\nbe able to see this stuff laid out, right.\n\n191\n00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.070\nBut, we can't actually fix the problem.\n\n192\n00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.445\nI see this over-allocation.\n\n193\n00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.775\nGreat, I need to deal with it.\n\n194\n00:09:31.775 --> 00:09:32.935\nYou can't fix it from a report.\n\n195\n00:09:32.935 --> 00:09:34.335\nA report is a static being.\n\n196\n00:09:34.335 --> 00:09:36.025\nWe can change the data\nthat's being displayed, but\n\n197\n00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:38.085\nwe can't change the data itself.\n\n198\n00:09:38.085 --> 00:09:40.265\nSo, we still need the resource sheet.\n\n199\n00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:41.825\nWe still need the team planner.\n\n200\n00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:44.905\nWe still need utilities like that\nto actually go and fix things.\n\n201\n00:09:44.905 --> 00:09:47.495\nThis is just outputting the data.\n\n202\n00:09:47.495 --> 00:09:51.530\nSo, for a project manager,\nThese reports don't really help you so\n\n203\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.170\nmuch, they're really designed\nto help the stakeholders.\n\n204\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.360\nThe other people invested in the project\nthat need to understand what's going on.\n\n205\n00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.450\nFor you,\nyou'll still rely on your other tools.\n\n206\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.390\n>> You know, those other tools are really\nimportant because what Donna's telling us\n\n207\n00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.330\nis that if we actually start seeing\nsomething that's a little bit unusual,\n\n208\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.420\nit doesn't mean that we go in here and\nwe change it, right.\n\n209\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.320\nWe actually have to be able to go and\ntake a look at those other views\n\n210\n00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.610\nBe able to take a look at the data\nthat it's actually based off of and\n\n211\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.850\nthen modify it from there.\n\n212\n00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.130\nOne of the things that we can do is to\nactually understand that even though these\n\n213\n00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.730\nreports are good for other people,\nthey're also good for\n\n214\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.420\nus to be able to make decisions and\nto be able to actually say,\n\n215\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.220\nhey look, I need to go back in and\ntrack something like this as well.\n\n216\n00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.510\nSo, not only do we have the ability to\ncreate multiple reports from the ones that\n\n217\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.930\nare already generated right here, but\nwe can also go in and use this to\n\n218\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.040\nactually show us some of the different\nviews that we also have on hand as well.\n\n219\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:49.610\nLet me show you an example of a field\nthat I like to see every once in a while.\n\n220\n00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.080\nSo if I go to view, and\nI select resource usage now And\n\n221\n00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.670\nwhen we start taking\na look at stuff like this.\n\n222\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.110\nAnd let me kind of scroll down\nhere to this support technician.\n\n223\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:07.600\nAnd I'll change the scroll to the task\nwhich is actually over allocated as well.\n\n224\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.190\nThat there's actually another field\nin here that we can add in that\n\n225\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.930\nreally helps us to see what we call\nthe cumulative value of things So\n\n226\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.510\nnotice that right here on\nthe support technician.\n\n227\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.460\nAnd I might actually be seeing that.\n\n228\n00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.040\nSo I had the overallocation,\nI'm like why is he overallocated?\n\n229\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.050\nWhat's actually happening\non that entire week of the?\n\n230\n00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.530\nWell I know that he's assigned\nright here for 12 hours for him.\n\n231\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.030\nBut if I take a look on this\nMonday it looks like two hours.\n\n232\n00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:38.620\nNow I'd have to scroll all the way down\nand add in both of those hours to see.\n\n233\n00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.160\nBut let's say that I did the over\nallocation based on the week or something.\n\n234\n00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.530\nWell there is a cumulative\n\n235\n00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.150\nfield value that we can also end up\ndisplaying that may help us out.\n\n236\n00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.980\nAnd sometimes being able to see\nstuff like that is essential.\n\n237\n00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.310\nWhen I click on format, notice I can\nactually select the overallocation or\n\n238\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.290\nactually it's right here.\n\n239\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.180\nThe accumulative work, and\nthis is what I wanted to be able to see.\n\n240\n00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.410\nIf I scroll back up,\nlet me scroll down here, there it is.\n\n241\n00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.370\nYou can now see that on\nthis field right here,\n\n242\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.030\nI know that he's got 12 hours on\nthis day and it begins to add up.\n\n243\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.250\nBut now notice that as we\ncontinue to move on and\n\n244\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:20.180\nhe's actually assigned additional work\nhere, For the 36 hours on that day.\n\n245\n00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.210\nWe continue to actually are able to\nadd up his work hours by the week and\n\n246\n00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.550\nactually continue on throughout the\nremaining project year, and then go, wow,\n\n247\n00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.720\nhe worked like 160 hours\nin those three weeks.\n\n248\n00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.210\nIt's a little bit hefty.\n\n249\n00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.170\nAnd then go back in and\nactually readjust those allocations too.\n\n250\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.890\n>> Yeah and that's handy when\nyou're assigning over time.\n\n251\n00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.060\nIt's also handy when you have\npeople who work odd shifts.\n\n252\n00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.790\nYou might have employees,\nyour normal work day is an eight hour day.\n\n253\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.270\nBut, instead of working\nfive eight hour days,\n\n254\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.060\nyou might have some employee\nwho works four 10 hour days.\n\n255\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.210\nIt's still 40 hours at\nthe end of the week, and\n\n256\n00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.620\nyour cumulative total will show that,\nright?\n\n257\n00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.550\nThat yeah sure,\nyou're doing two hours extra each day, but\n\n258\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.230\nby the end of the week,\n\n259\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.660\nit just adds up to 40 and it's okay,\nit's nice to be able to see those things.\n\n260\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.360\nNow Ronnie, I do want to touch on one\nmore thing on the reports, though.\n\n261\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.570\nIf we jump back to the reports,\nwhen we generate this data, and\n\n262\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.620\nreally it's not just the reports but\nanywhere inside of Project,\n\n263\n00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.925\nif I want to send this to somebody else\nAnd I know they don't have project, right?\n\n264\n00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:20.275\nSo, maybe that overallocation report, so\nthe HR department calls down and says,\n\n265\n00:13:20.275 --> 00:13:21.885\nhey, we knew about this project and\n\n266\n00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:24.455\nwe just need to get a summary to make\nsure you're not overallocating anybody.\n\n267\n00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:28.250\nWe don't want to deal with overtime or\nOr labor laws, union disputes,\n\n268\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.150\nthings like that.\n\n269\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.000\nSo, they want a copy of this report.\n\n270\n00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.990\nWell, how do we give them a copy of this\nreport if they don't have project and\n\n271\n00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.140\nthis report is entirely in project?\n\n272\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.390\nSo, one of the easiest things that we can\ndo is we can export it into a more common\n\n273\n00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.410\nformat, right, Ronnie?\n\n274\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.040\n>> You really can.\n\n275\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.360\nYou have a couple of options\nto be able to do that.\n\n276\n00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.250\nIf you already have the report up,\nnotice that inside of the design tab\n\n277\n00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.730\nYou have the ability to\njust copy this report and\n\n278\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.550\nit says if you do it, you can copy it and\npaste it into another application.\n\n279\n00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.560\nYou can do that if that's\nwhat you need it, but\n\n280\n00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.400\nwhat if they say look,\nI don't have a copy of that stuff.\n\n281\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.360\nI really don't have the ability\nto To open it in that program, so\n\n282\n00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.610\ncan you just send it as PDF instead.\n\n283\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.700\nSo, we can actually do stuff like that\nas well by simply having that report.\n\n284\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:17.740\nAnd then, oh, let me see,\nwe go into File and Save as.\n\n285\n00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.860\nWell, you actually want to do File and\nExport.\n\n286\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.330\nExport, there's a reason for that.\n\n287\n00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.060\nSo it does get a little bit confusing so\n\n288\n00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.060\nrule number one is you definitely\nhave to have the report open first.\n\n289\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.450\nBecause when you go to File and Export,\n\n290\n00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.050\nit's going to export whatever it\nis you're displaying at that time.\n\n291\n00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.670\nSo if you're on your Gantt chart view,\nyou're exporting your Gantt chart view.\n\n292\n00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.330\nAll right.\n\n293\n00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.310\nNow, if you do that Save As option,\n\n294\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.130\nyou actually do have the ability\nto go to PDFs through that, but\n\n295\n00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:43.670\nit's gonna do the whole project,\nwhich is rarely something that you want.\n\n296\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.872\nI can't ever think of\nwhen you'd want that, so\n\n297\n00:14:45.872 --> 00:14:48.790\nwhen you When you've got something like\nthat report open, when you go to file\n\n298\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.820\nan export, you're just exporting\nwhat you you're currently viewing.\n\n299\n00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.870\nAnd that's that's what we normally want.\n\n300\n00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.070\nAnd you'll see there's only\na couple of options right?\n\n301\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.850\nCreate pdf for xps and\nthen you've got that save project as file,\n\n302\n00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:03.460\nnow If I wanted to export into excel or\nsomething then that's where that save\n\n303\n00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.700\nproject as file comes in that's\nwhere I'd want that one.\n\n304\n00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.820\nBut if it's just a report,\nyou'll choose PDF or XPS,\n\n305\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.070\nnow Rodney, you always used XPS right?\n\n306\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.500\n>> Absolutely,\nanytime I have the ability to use it and\n\n307\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.695\nsomeone asks me for it I will use it Tom.\n\n308\n00:15:17.695 --> 00:15:21.980\n[LAUGH] If you're not familiar with it,\nyou know, PDF is the what is it,\n\n309\n00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.560\nPortable Document Format from Adobe?\n\n310\n00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.420\nEvery computer in the entire planet\npractically is able to open up PDFs.\n\n311\n00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.550\nSo it's the safe way to export things.\n\n312\n00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.620\nXPS is Microsoft's equivalent of a PDF.\n\n313\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.930\nAnd so if you're in a Windows world all\nyour machines will be able to open them.\n\n314\n00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.020\nIf you're on a Mac or\non a Linux box you may or\n\n315\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.170\nmay not be able to open up xps though,\nso most people do pdf.\n\n316\n00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.870\nBy exporting this diagram as a pdf,\nusers will be able to view it, first off,\n\n317\n00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.760\nwhich is important.\n\n318\n00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.440\nThey'll be able to zoom in and\nzoom out and\n\n319\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.520\nit won't get all grainy and crumbly like\nif we copy and paste into other software.\n\n320\n00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.650\nSo this is a great way to\nshare data out with your team.\n\n321\n00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.140\nAnd it's quick and it's easy.\n\n322\n00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.490\n>> All right.\n\n323\n00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.840\nSo being able to actually save\neverything and get it ready to go.\n\n324\n00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.950\nNow we can email it to somebody, put it on\na file share, they can take a look at it.\n\n325\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.800\nAnd even better, they can't actually\nmanipulate any of the data that\n\n326\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.020\nwe're actually seeing there which is part\nof why we actually love PDFs as well.\n\n327\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.410\nTo be able to get information\nout in any format and\n\n328\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.020\nbecause those readers are free It\nmakes it fairly universal for us too.\n\n329\n00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.890\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's the key thing to remember.\n\n330\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.670\nNot everybody has Project, but\nwe wanna share this information with them.\n\n331\n00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.900\nAnd this is a little different than visual\nreports where we exported to Visio or\n\n332\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.840\nExcel, they had to have that.\n\n333\n00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.170\nThat's expensive software.\n\n334\n00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:30.680\nBut a PDF reader?\n\n335\n00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.170\nWell, if you're running Windows 8 or\n\n336\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.350\nWindows 10,\nthey've got a PDF reader built in to that.\n\n337\n00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.590\nMac OS has a PDF reader built into it.\n\n338\n00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.840\nMost Linux distros, you can install\nAdobe Reader or some other program.\n\n339\n00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.860\nAnd they can watch it for free.\n\n340\n00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.370\nSo it's such a great way\nto share that information.\n\n341\n00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.600\n>> Now Don, another feature inside of\nthe report is what they call the dashboard\n\n342\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.670\nfeatures that are also in here, too.\n\n343\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.690\nSo inside a report, if I select\ndashboards, says make a better decision\n\n344\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.220\nby viewing eye catching dynamic\nreports based on new projects data.\n\n345\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.330\nIt sounds like a wonderland, Don,\nof all the things that we can do, but\n\n346\n00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.180\nthese are actually designed for\nvery specific things that you might have.\n\n347\n00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.650\nAnd they actually have everything\nfrom cost overrun to burndown reports\n\n348\n00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:09.650\nto work overview.\n\n349\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.280\nSo let me go ahead and\nselect this burndown report so\n\n350\n00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.430\nthat we can take a look\nat whats happening.\n\n351\n00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.455\nNow This a new term for me Don,\nit's the term burn down.\n\n352\n00:17:17.455 --> 00:17:18.430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But it says\n\n353\n00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.580\nshow how much work you have completed and\nhow much work you have left,\n\n354\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:27.010\nif the remaining cumulative work line is\nsteeper than the project it may be late.\n\n355\n00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.900\nSo right here it's showing me that\nhere's my remaining cumulative work, and\n\n356\n00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.400\nit's definitely not steeper.\n\n357\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.290\nSo that shows me that at this\npoint here the remaining\n\n358\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.650\nbaseline work looks like\nit's going to end here.\n\n359\n00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.060\nBut I'm actually doing pretty good.\n\n360\n00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.880\nIf it was steeper,\nthen I would have a problem.\n\n361\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.600\nIt allows me to see very easily then,\nwhether or\n\n362\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.280\nnot I'm actually still on track,\non, task, as well.\n\n363\n00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.660\nOn track with the work, and\nthen also on track here too.\n\n364\n00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.760\nSo you might have something just\nlike this, if somebody's asking for\n\n365\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.520\nsomething like this.\n\n366\n00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.900\nLike how are you in comparison to what\nthe baseline is actually showing.\n\n367\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.250\nTwo you can actually select\nthe report like that.\n\n368\n00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.170\n>> Yeah and you know things like\nthe burndown is just a really easy\n\n369\n00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.950\nway to see when your project starts,\nyou've got work planed and\n\n370\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.360\n100% of it still needs to be done.\n\n371\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.720\nAnd in theory as the project goes on\nthat number should be going down.\n\n372\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.380\nHere at a glance we can see it,\nthis is live data.\n\n373\n00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.920\nSo as we update our project we can go\nback to this project and get a view here.\n\n374\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.340\nNow these dashboards are designed for\nus as project managers, as well as for\n\n375\n00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.030\nthe other people that are associated with\nthe project just so they can quickly and\n\n376\n00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.720\neasily monitor status.\n\n377\n00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.760\nNow, you may find that the reports that\nare built in are perfectly adequate, but\n\n378\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.880\nyou can create your own and kind of\nget those set up to meet your needs.\n\n379\n00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.840\nBut the dashboards are just an effective\nway of quickly seeing that data.\n\n380\n00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.660\nAnd they're not really any\ndifferent than the other reports.\n\n381\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.450\nUsually the big difference is that\nthe dashboards are heavily reliant on just\n\n382\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:50.020\ncharts like graphs and\ndiagrams as opposed to raw lists of data.\n\n383\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.920\nBut some of them, like the cost overview,\nand this one's really cool cuz\n\n384\n00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.500\nyou get nice big summary data, and it\ndraws your attention to what's important.\n\n385\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.130\nYou get the big numbers that\npeople care about right there,\n\n386\n00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.890\nand then the supporting data\nalongside it if they care about that.\n\n387\n00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:04.409\nUsually they don't.\n\n388\n00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.960\n>> So it really is handy.\n\n389\n00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.250\nThat way, I don't actually have to come up\nwith, how do I come up with this report?\n\n390\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.510\nThere's so many of these different\noptions inside of the reporting\n\n391\n00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.010\ntools that are built into Project.\n\n392\n00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.950\nIt's really easy to rely\non the majority of them,\n\n393\n00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.360\nto get us to show what we need to\nshow inside of Microsoft Project.\n\n394\n00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.010\nSo, there are a lot of features that\nare actually in there for that.\n\n395\n00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.870\n>> Yeah and just remember the dashboards,\nthey're just a subset\n\n396\n00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.610\nof the built in reporting so there's not\nreally anything too special about them.\n\n397\n00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.040\nThey're just a range to\naccent the important data.\n\n398\n00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.990\nAnd dashboard it's kind of\na buzz word these days.\n\n399\n00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.090\nI think in a previous version of Project\nthese would of just be called reports.\n\n400\n00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.610\nBut, it's something that\na lot of executives expect.\n\n401\n00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.650\nThey're like hey, can I get a dashboard\nthat shows me this there or something.\n\n402\n00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.450\nIt's just kind of an expectation\nof leadership now.\n\n403\n00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.060\n>> Yeah you kind of see it's\nreally multiple reports right,\n\n404\n00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.260\nall pulled into one, but\nreally just the essential information.\n\n405\n00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.260\nThe summary like Don talked about and\nthen over here on the right hand side,\n\n406\n00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.850\nat least for this one, says a cost report.\n\n407\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.078\nI don't know why it's not\nscrolling down for me or up.\n\n408\n00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:07.330\nMy scroll feature has\nactually stopped there.\n\n409\n00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.040\nSo for one reason or\nanother, it's not scrolling.\n\n410\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.020\nOh there we go.\n\n411\n00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.130\nWe can see progress versus cost,\ncost status, and they are.\n\n412\n00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.140\nThey're actually separate reports that\nare grouped into this one report, and\n\n413\n00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.800\na nice little visual here.\n\n414\n00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.130\nBeing able to actually put this\nonto a presentation of some sort\n\n415\n00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.980\nis normally what people really love\nwhen they start seeing this stuff.\n\n416\n00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.830\n>> Yeah.\nAnd opposed to looking at the raw data,\n\n417\n00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.550\nwhat you're seeing here\nare cumulative values.\n\n418\n00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:33.940\nSo when you see that remaining cost,\nthat's the accumulative cost across\n\n419\n00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.990\nall of the remaining activities\nthat haven't been completed yet.\n\n420\n00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.210\nSo we could see all this\ninformation in our cost sheet, and\n\n421\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.810\nyou could see that laid out\non each individual activity.\n\n422\n00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.900\nHere, it's all rolled up into one big\ncost, so we know that we've already\n\n423\n00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.840\nspent $19,000 on the project, and\nwe can expect to spend another $9,000.\n\n424\n00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.090\nSo we're well on our way, but\n\n425\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.530\nwe still have an outstanding expense\nthat's gonna need to be come up with.\n\n426\n00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.990\nSomebody's got to write that check, right?\n\n427\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's not all at once,\n\n428\n00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.280\nit's cumulative, everything out for\nthe remainder of the project.\n\n429\n00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.820\n>> Yeah, so they can be handy.\n\n430\n00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.140\nAnd of course if you choose to,\nyou can go in there and\n\n431\n00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.255\nprobably re-customize and pull up\nthe exact data that you need to see.\n\n432\n00:21:11.255 --> 00:21:13.825\nBut by having it there,\nit's sort of like working with a template.\n\n433\n00:21:13.825 --> 00:21:17.605\nGo in there, and then at that point you\ncan select those over in the Field List.\n\n434\n00:21:17.605 --> 00:21:22.445\nThen you can actually choose and\nshow what you really want to show.\n\n435\n00:21:22.445 --> 00:21:27.100\nSo the customization is kind of\nanother nice and key feature as well.\n\n436\n00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.080\nNow the other thing that we can also do.\n\n437\n00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.020\nThere is several other display\ntypes of values that we can also be\n\n438\n00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:38.120\nable to do here, which is the earlier\nones that I ever remember doing.\n\n439\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.040\nWhich is initially\nthe graphic that we could use\n\n440\n00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.310\nis just by simply copying the actual\nproject gant chart itself.\n\n441\n00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.890\nAnd then we could add it\ninto a report as well.\n\n442\n00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:54.170\nInside of Microsoft Project,\nat least as far back as I remember, 2003,\n\n443\n00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:59.445\nthere used to be a little camera\nicon is what it used to be.\n\n444\n00:21:59.445 --> 00:22:01.215\nSo what you would do is you\nwould want to go ahead and\n\n445\n00:22:01.215 --> 00:22:05.095\nset up your project view right here.\n\n446\n00:22:05.095 --> 00:22:08.165\nTo display what you wanted it to display.\n\n447\n00:22:08.165 --> 00:22:11.730\nSo you would actually kind of\nhave to manually manipulate this.\n\n448\n00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.790\nAnd maybe even scroll and\n\n449\n00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.700\nlet's say I just want to take a look\nat some of the critical tasks here.\n\n450\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.560\nNow you don't always have to do it\nthis way because I'll show you why in\n\n451\n00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.620\nthe new features, they've actually\nmade it a little bit better.\n\n452\n00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.150\nLet's say that this is what\nI want to just be able to\n\n453\n00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.320\nprint out on a sheet\nof paper at some time.\n\n454\n00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.270\nWell this is the one, where they've\nactually now, I'd say hidden it, but\n\n455\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:35.660\nif I go to task, and\nI go to copy notice I can copy a picture.\n\n456\n00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.960\nAnd that's saying take this\nscreen right here and copy it.\n\n457\n00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.560\nWhen I do that notice it\nstill gives me these options.\n\n458\n00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.580\nThese options have been around for\na long time.\n\n459\n00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.140\nIs this for a screen or for a printer I'm\nnot actually gonna send this to a printer.\n\n460\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.340\nYou want to store it as a gif file, but\nnotice I have these two different options.\n\n461\n00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.900\nDo I want the rows on the screen or\nselected, and then at the bottom,\n\n462\n00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.260\nI can actually even select what my\ntime scale is going to be as well.\n\n463\n00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.930\nSo that way we can see what,\nwhat we normally want to see here.\n\n464\n00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:10.170\nSo if I say hey, I'm actually gonna print\nthis out inside of a word document.\n\n465\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.550\nI can click okay, and\nnow that saves it into my clipboard.\n\n466\n00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.889\nThis point on here, I can paste it into.\n\n467\n00:23:17.889 --> 00:23:19.544\nSee if I can pull up Paint.\n\n468\n00:23:19.544 --> 00:23:21.363\n>> Going hi-tech on this one.\n\n469\n00:23:21.363 --> 00:23:22.390\n>> Hi-tech on this one.\n\n470\n00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.760\nAnd then I can do a Ctrl+V.\n\n471\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.260\nThere we go.\n\n472\n00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.550\nThat's fine control, and\nI'm not so good at control.\n\n473\n00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:35.850\nAnd you can actually see it didn't\nactually take my ribbons up at the top.\n\n474\n00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.720\nBut it really took what I wanted in here,\nand you can see why you might\n\n475\n00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.270\npull this into a Word document,\nand then have it printed out.\n\n476\n00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.370\nAnd that way, it actually did display\nonly the time scale that I needed.\n\n477\n00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.240\nAnd so if somebody is asking about it,\nthat's what we can also do.\n\n478\n00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.150\nYou'll see that it really kind of\ncut off some of my names over here,\n\n479\n00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:55.540\non the right-hand side, because I told it,\nhere's the right-hand side,\n\n480\n00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.800\nas far as the time scale.\n\n481\n00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.440\nIf I wanted to show all that information,\n\n482\n00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.840\nI'd probably slide that time scale out\na little longer, but it's a quick graphic\n\n483\n00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.450\nway that we can get a fairly simple\nreport out if we just want to see that.\n\n484\n00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.900\nAnd there's a particular\ntable view that you wanted,\n\n485\n00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.880\nthat you just weren't able to explain,\nor for one reason or another,\n\n486\n00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.480\nworking those reports, you weren't able\nto get exactly what you wanted to.\n\n487\n00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.200\nYou can do the same thing here.\n\n488\n00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.090\nPull up that table, add in those\nadditional columns that you want to.\n\n489\n00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.700\nAnd then go ahead and\ndo that, the copy picture.\n\n490\n00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.900\nAnd it will also copy a picture of\nthat table for you and sort in.\n\n491\n00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.420\nGood thing is it's no longer\nattached to the data.\n\n492\n00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.880\nso there's nothing that I can do in\nhere that will actually manipulate and\n\n493\n00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.180\nchange the data that's\nexisting in my project plan.\n\n494\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:38.160\n>> Yeah.\nAgain,\n\n495\n00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.060\njust trying to make it easy to get that\ndata out of here, knowing that the bulk of\n\n496\n00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.960\nthe people in your organization aren't\ngoing to have access to Project.\n\n497\n00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.710\nIf they did,\nif they were all Project experts,\n\n498\n00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:47.730\nwe really wouldn't need any of this.\n\n499\n00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.015\nThey could just log in and\nsee it, but that's not the case.\n\n500\n00:24:50.015 --> 00:24:51.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n501\n00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:55.160\nWell Ronnie, we have seen a number of\ndifferent ways to generate reports inside\n\n502\n00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.690\nof Project, to export data from Project,\nto copy and paste and rearrange.\n\n503\n00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.560\nI mean we've seen just a whole,\n\n504\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.580\na virtual cornucopia of recording options,\na plethora if you will.\n\n505\n00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.990\n>> Wow, nice\n>> I don't know what to tell you.\n\n506\n00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.800\nIt's high dollar word time.\n\n507\n00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.400\nBut can you think of anything else that we\nneed to throw in here for completeness?\n\n508\n00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.410\n>> Not really.\n\n509\n00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.760\nJust take advantage of those reports,\nright?\n\n510\n00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.060\nIt's always the easiest thing.\n\n511\n00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.030\nWell, that's not gonna do\neverything that I need it to.\n\n512\n00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.230\nBut, being able to start\nwith that baseline.\n\n513\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.190\nAnd then,\nusing that task list to manipulate and\n\n514\n00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.250\nchange the data to see\nwhat you want to see.\n\n515\n00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.960\nProbably gonna be a lot easier than you\nhaving to manually create ever single\n\n516\n00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.250\nreport that you're gonna see.\n\n517\n00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.520\nProject is really trying to\nsave you time in the end,\n\n518\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.370\nand allow you to manage the project,\nand not so much having to twist and\n\n519\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.560\nto twist it to make a single report.\n\n520\n00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.300\nSo use them.\n\n521\n00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.830\n>> All right.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n522\n00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.050\nthat is our show.\n\n523\n00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.400\nWe hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n524\n00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.280\nStay tuned.\nWe do have more\n\n525\n00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.800\nProject episodes coming down the line,\nbut for today, we'll wrap this one up.\n\n526\n00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.330\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pizette.\n\n527\n00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.580\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n528\n00:25:54.580

00:00:15.250\ngood evening and welcome back\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.110\nI'm your host Don Pezet back again with\nRonny Wong, how's it going Ronny?.\n\n5\n00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.750\n>> It is going well today, another\ngreat day to be here in the studio.\n\n6\n00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.210\nReady to take a look at\nsome microsoft projects.\n\n7\n00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.850\nNow rodney we are winding down our\nmicrosoft project series here.\n\n8\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.780\nWe've covered a lot of the features and\nfunctions that are available and\n\n9\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.450\nthings your going to use everyday.\n\n10\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.730\nBut in todays episode we're going to\ndeviate a little bit and say what happens\n\n11\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.690\nwhen there is something we want\nproject to do and it just can't do it.\n\n12\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660\nIt doesn't have a feature that we wanted,\nor\n\n13\n00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.030\na function or there's some repetitive\ntask we need to create or perform.\n\n14\n00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.870\nAnd project doesn't have\na mechanism in there for it.\n\n15\n00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.130\nWell, fortunately microsoft has thought\nabout that, and they said well,\n\n16\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.520\nwe don't know how everybody out\nthere manages their projects.\n\n17\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.400\nWe don't know what other software\nthey might be leveraging, or\n\n18\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.980\nwhat functionality they expect.\n\n19\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.070\nWe'll try our best, but there's going\nto be some things we can't offer.\n\n20\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.110\nAnd so they give us a number of ways\nto extend the functionality of project.\n\n21\n00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.930\nBeyond what microsoft\noriginally envisioned.\n\n22\n00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.860\nRight Ronnie?\n\n23\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.070\n>> Microsoft project really does want\nyou to be able to do anything that you\n\n24\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.810\npossibly can to deal with whatever\nproject's on hand, but they know because\n\n25\n00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.010\nof the way that you're actually gonna work\nwith it in whatever situation, there's\n\n26\n00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.950\nprobably gonna be a point in time in which\nit's not gonna meet every single need.\n\n27\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.890\nSo the nice thing about that is that\nthere's a couple of different options that\n\n28\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.730\nwe have available to us.\n\n29\n00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.260\nFrom third party solutions all the way to\nthings which were actually developed for\n\n30\n00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.300\nmicrosoft, and even probably some\nof them by microsoft itself.\n\n31\n00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.670\nTo allow you to add in additional\ncapabilities into project two.\n\n32\n00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.855\nAnd the way that you do that is\nby going to the microsoft store,\n\n33\n00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:50.200\nis the way that you do that.\n\n34\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.800\nAnd then, you can purchase apps or\n\n35\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.440\nyou can actually get apps for free and\nadd them into project as well.\n\n36\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.890\nSo, let me show you what\nI'm talking about too.\n\n37\n00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.760\nSo, I went ahead and\nbrowse over to the store.office.com.\n\n38\n00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.110\nI'll never be able to say that again.\n\n39\n00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.890\nAnd then once I got to that office store,\ninside the little search box,\n\n40\n00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.160\nI simply typed in project.\n\n41\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.940\nAnd that brought me up to\na very filtered list here for\n\n42\n00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.330\napps for project is what it did.\n\n43\n00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.490\nNow I thought, this is cool.\n\n44\n00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.150\nAnd as I took a look at this gray bar,\ndonna showed me one of 43 and I thought,\n\n45\n00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.840\noh my gosh.\n\n46\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.850\n43 different apps specifically designed\nto help improve project function.\n\n47\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.280\nAnd so I started looking up, all right,\nthat looks cool, but microsoft word,\n\n48\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.930\nwhat's going on here?.\n\n49\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.160\nAnd the search the web textmaster and\nI started realizing something.\n\n50\n00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.130\nIt's not that they can't be used with\nthe project but it's just the very fact\n\n51\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.660\nthat they're not all specifically\ndesigned for projects specifically.\n\n52\n00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.560\nSo, some of them are actually designed for\nthe entire office package and\n\n53\n00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.570\nthey also added some of\nthose things in there but\n\n54\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.120\nthey do have some tools to help us to\nextend out some of the capabilities.\n\n55\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.690\nWhat you might find, just basic\nfunctionality inside a microsoft project.\n\n56\n00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.940\nBut then if you got out there\neven into the office Store\n\n57\n00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.825\nyou can see that they do have\na few different ones in here for\n\n58\n00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:14.720\nprojectsm so\nhere is one that says analyze the plan.\n\n59\n00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.510\nSo they do have a free project\nanalyzer for you that can go in and\n\n60\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.900\ntake a look at that project plan and\nthen be able to inspect and\n\n61\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.900\nsee where you're actually\nhaving some issues.\n\n62\n00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.590\nAnd then of course notice that they\neven have some third party apps as well.\n\n63\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.060\nAnd this is where\nmicrosoft is really pushing\n\n64\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.120\nis that the very fact that you're gonna\nsee more apps, just like an app store, so\n\n65\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.400\nthat you can improve the functionality\nof everything that you have.\n\n66\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.980\nSo here's one by a company called sensei.\n\n67\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.950\nThey also have a task analyzer and\na dashboard.\n\n68\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.460\nAnd then here's another company down here,\nprojility connect.\n\n69\n00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.540\nAnd so you do see a few that look\nlike that they're specific for\n\n70\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.760\nMicrosoft projects.\n\n71\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.100\nBut then you have things like this,\nthe ultimate plagiarism checker that\n\n72\n00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.870\ndoesn't seem to actually add\nin any real functionality, but\n\n73\n00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.610\njust kind of be able to\ngo through there and\n\n74\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.920\ngo hey, that might be something I can use,\nsometimes you do get recommendations, but\n\n75\n00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.920\nthat's not where you find the power\nof most of these built in apps for\n\n76\n00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.530\noffice even though that's probably where\nyou want to go first if you're looking for\n\n77\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.990\nextendability in project.\n\n78\n00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.120\nNow because I said that, this is not\nprobably the first place you're gonna go,\n\n79\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.820\nthere are several other tools that\nare developed out there by third parties.\n\n80\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.870\nIn other words,\nother software vendors that said,\n\n81\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.310\nlook we really do like microsoft project.\n\n82\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.810\nBut we wish it could do this,\n\n83\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.630\nit could integrate better\nwith this particular field.\n\n84\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.180\nAnd that's some of the ones\nthat we wanna show you as well.\n\n85\n00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.090\nSo one that don kind of told me about\nhere is one called the connector for\n\n86\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.680\njira, is that how we pronounce it?.\n\n87\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.790\n>> Yep, so if you're from the software\ndevelopment world you're probably familiar\n\n88\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.420\nwith that last scene in jira.\n\n89\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.200\nAnd it's a great software suite for people\nto manage software development projects.\n\n90\n00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.930\nBut it goes kind of beyond what\nwe consider normal projects.\n\n91\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.520\nIt's got a lot of functionality\nbuilt into support\n\n92\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.930\nlike the agile development prep methods,\nit's also got bug Bug tracking and\n\n93\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.800\nerror reporting,\nconfigurations inside of there.\n\n94\n00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.860\nIt's got a lot of stuff that's really\ndesigned for software development.\n\n95\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.050\nAnd when you look at microsoft project,\nit doesn't have that stuff in there.\n\n96\n00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.530\nIt doesn't know about sprint,\nsome user cases and all that good stuff.\n\n97\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.910\nIt doesn't have that.\n\n98\n00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.830\nSo what if I'm in a software\ndevelopment house.\n\n99\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.890\nI've got all these developers that\nwant the functionality of jira but\n\n100\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.460\nI'm the project manager and I want\nto use microsoft project, who wins?.\n\n101\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.080\nWell at the end of the day\nyou really need your\n\n102\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.320\nworkers to have the best\ntools available to them.\n\n103\n00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.760\nAnd so for those workers microsoft\nproject is not the right solution.\n\n104\n00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.870\nFor them, they're developers,\nthey need the bug tracking,\n\n105\n00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.990\nthey need the user stories,\nthey need all that other functionality,\n\n106\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.940\nand they can get that with gira.\n\n107\n00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.300\nSo we let them use gira.\n\n108\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.050\nWe as the project managers, use microsoft\nproject and then we run software,\n\n109\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.710\nlike what the connector has to\nbe able to link them together.\n\n110\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.010\nSo when we have a milestone schedule in\nproject, it shows as a milestone in jira\n\n111\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.910\nand when they start going through and\ngetting ready to do a push.\n\n112\n00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.720\nWell, it shows as an activity\ninside a project.\n\n113\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.660\nThe two get linked together.\n\n114\n00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.770\nAnd it really is a great solution because\n\n115\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.830\nthere is no one project software\nthat's perfect for everybody.\n\n116\n00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.120\nIt's just not possible.\n\n117\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.710\nYou could write one from scratch but\nyou don't have to.\n\n118\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.010\nYou can use separate software packages and\njust link them together.\n\n119\n00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.690\nIt really is very helpful when you do have\nthose different fields in which you go,\n\n120\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.500\nI know that I can manage this\nproject inside of a project, but\n\n121\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.010\neverybody else is using this.\n\n122\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.640\nSee if you can find one,\nseems like a good solution for\n\n123\n00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.390\nthat software development side of things.\n\n124\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.190\nNow we also talked about in our shows\nearlier that even though we can track\n\n125\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.550\nsome of the expenditures\ninside of project itself,\n\n126\n00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.850\nbecause it does give us that ability to do\nso, it gives us fields that we can add in\n\n127\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.130\nsome basic costs into,\nit really isn't accounting software.\n\n128\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.410\nAccounting software was something\nlike what we would normally use.\n\n129\n00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.130\nIt's something like quick books or\nsome other thing that we might have.\n\n130\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.260\nAnd what you might find out is that, hey,\n\n131\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.260\ncan projects actually use\nsomething like that, as well?.\n\n132\n00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.900\nWell, there are other tools that\nare also able to help us, too.\n\n133\n00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.700\nAnd another one that we have\nhere is one like journyx,\n\n134\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.090\nanother one that we also have\nthat has a project link.\n\n135\n00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.230\nAnd the project link is really\ndesigned to help us to be able to\n\n136\n00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.730\nconnect into projects.\n\n137\n00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.550\nAnd even things like well,\nquick books as well, and\n\n138\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.390\nthat's an accounting software that,\n\n139\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.540\nthat can really help you to add to that\nfull functionality for accounting too.\n\n140\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.040\n>> Yep.\n\n141\n00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.360\n>> Yeah, and I know I've made\nthe comment in this show before that\n\n142\n00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.740\nwhile project does have cost scheduling\nand we can do basic budgeting in there,\n\n143\n00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.500\nat the end of the day project is not\nsuitable for sending out invoices and\n\n144\n00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.480\nbilling, cutting checks and\nthings of that nature.\n\n145\n00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.042\nIt takes on for like quick books.\n\n146\n00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:42.270\nQuick Books can actually like\nprint the check for you and\n\n147\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.550\nall you have to do is sign it and\nit's all tied right in there.\n\n148\n00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.300\nSo it's great for\ndoing budgeting and accounting.\n\n149\n00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.860\nAgain, well we don't have to choose one or\nthe other.\n\n150\n00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.250\nWe just like them together.\n\n151\n00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.910\nAnd that's what journix does\nis they provide a connect that\n\n152\n00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.430\nbasically shares that information.\n\n153\n00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.390\nSo now.\n\n154\n00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.230\nWhen you have an activity that is\nmaybe being subcontracted out and\n\n155\n00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.350\nthat subcontractor needs to get paid,\nwell that activity has a cost.\n\n156\n00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.320\nYou might set a cost code to it.\n\n157\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.760\nSo that synchronizes over to QuickBooks\nwhere the accountants can see it.\n\n158\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.850\nThey see the code, so\n\n159\n00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:17.560\nthey know what part of the project is that\ngenerated that fee or incurred that cost.\n\n160\n00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.520\nAnd they know to cut\nthe check out to that person.\n\n161\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.240\nSo that's all being done outside in the\naccounting software where it's important.\n\n162\n00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.920\n>> And the last tool that we really want\nto focus in on here is one that we call\n\n163\n00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.980\nWBS Schedule Pro.\n\n164\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.980\nAnd this is one that Don says, hey I\nhave familiarity with this one as well.\n\n165\n00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.770\nAnd it's a neat tool that when\nyou actually do make a connect in\n\n166\n00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.180\nthe only thing it does is it actually\nprovides a new ribbon for you, and\n\n167\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.070\nyou actually end up with\nan entire set of tools\n\n168\n00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.110\nthat will also integrate with Project as\nwell to help enhance the functionality.\n\n169\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.670\nSo Don what is it best you\nlike about the addition here?\n\n170\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.850\n>> So this is another case of Project not\nbeing the right solution for everybody.\n\n171\n00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.260\nThat as a project manager,\nwe love projects.\n\n172\n00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.730\nYou got all sorts of great stuff in there,\nbut if you're the worker,\n\n173\n00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.200\nall you care about are the work\npackages that were assigned to you.\n\n174\n00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.560\nAnd so with the WBS product\nhere that's what they did,\n\n175\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.690\nthey focused on that\nwork breakdown schedule.\n\n176\n00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:15.210\nAnd so they are working on structure, and\nthey've created a scheduling program so\n\n177\n00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.550\nthat your workers can log in, they can\nsee the stuff that's assigned to them,\n\n178\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.010\nthey can do their progress reports\nright there inside the page.\n\n179\n00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.240\nThey're just logging into the webpage,\nit's just like a calendar to them.\n\n180\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.030\nBut if you're managing things in projects,\nare those status words coming over?\n\n181\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.180\nNo.\nIt's separate.\n\n182\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.350\nWell, these guys they wrote an add in, and\n\n183\n00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.880\nit basically ties in the project,\nand it allows that to be shared.\n\n184\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.200\nAnd these guys have a great example here.\n\n185\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.300\nWhen I say they wrote a connector\nthat ties in, what do I mean?\n\n186\n00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.490\nWell, it's a tight integration.\n\n187\n00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:47.500\nIf you look at their screenshot, see how\nthey actually add a tab inside of Project.\n\n188\n00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.200\nSo, as the project manager I don't even\nhave to go to the WBS schedule website.\n\n189\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.761\nI can just fire up Project and\n\n190\n00:09:52.761 --> 00:09:55.962\nright from inside Project I've\ngot that link to the site.\n\n191\n00:09:55.962 --> 00:10:00.134\nIt's got the connector in there so I know\nthat information is pushing back and\n\n192\n00:10:00.134 --> 00:10:01.428\nforth between the two.\n\n193\n00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:03.726\nIt's an amazing way to do that and\nnow my workers,\n\n194\n00:10:03.726 --> 00:10:06.520\nthey don't have to worry\nabout knowing Project.\n\n195\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.590\nWhen they wanna check their schedule,\n\n196\n00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.860\nthey just go to the schedule website and\nthey check in there.\n\n197\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.400\nSo, just another great example of\nlinking those external products.\n\n198\n00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.380\n>> There are so\nmany different ways that we can extend it,\n\n199\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.120\nbut these are kind of\nthose basic ways as well\n\n200\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.780\nthat check Microsoft Office store first of\ncourse, is where they want you to go and\n\n201\n00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.090\nsee if they do have that basic\napp that you can connect in.\n\n202\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.950\nDownload and, and be able to use\nalong with Microsoft Project.\n\n203\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.690\nBut, if not, know that there are plenty of\nother third party software developers out\n\n204\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.950\nthere, that really do\nwant to integrate in and\n\n205\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.740\nwork well with Microsoft Project to give\nyou the functionality that you need.\n\n206\n00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.900\nAnd really extend Project out, to well,\n\n207\n00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.650\ndifferent work environments\nas we need them, as well.\n\n208\n00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.069\nSo, that's one of the ways\nthat we can extend Project.\n\n209\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.240\n>> Yeah, now that's not the limit, right?\n\n210\n00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.350\nSo these were examples of\nthird party products or\n\n211\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.050\nproducts from the Microsoft store\nthat you can download and install.\n\n212\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.240\nSome are free, some are expensive.\n\n213\n00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.600\nSome are really expensive.\n\n214\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.930\nSome are really super expensive.\n\n215\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.080\nBut they all serve a purpose, right?\n\n216\n00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.590\nBut even still, you might not have\na solution that quite meets your need.\n\n217\n00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.360\nAnd so Microsoft does give us a way\nwhere we can kick the stops out and\n\n218\n00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.410\ncreate our own type of solutions.\n\n219\n00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.910\nNow this is not for the faint of heart.\n\n220\n00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.530\nAnd it can be very complex.\n\n221\n00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.100\nIt can be simple.\n\n222\n00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.990\nBut it can be complex too.\n\n223\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.110\nSo if we get to that point we\ncan always hire developers.\n\n224\n00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.810\nOr you know train staff,\nthey can come in and\n\n225\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.540\ncreate a customization that makes\nProject work the way that we want it to.\n\n226\n00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.880\n>> Yeah the other thing that we also\nwant to do is notice the ability for\n\n227\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.860\nProject to be well,\nstored somewhere else as well.\n\n228\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.460\nSo, normally by default,\nwhen I first started out,\n\n229\n00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.770\nI really didn't know everything\nthat there was to know about,\n\n230\n00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.570\nwell storing files that were\nactually on a network share.\n\n231\n00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.070\nBut today,\ncloud integration is a very big,\n\n232\n00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.340\nimportant way of the way\nthat the world works.\n\n233\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.350\nEspecially with Microsoft, also being tied\nin with things like the Project Server.\n\n234\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.320\nBut let's say that you actually\ndo want this particular\n\n235\n00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.470\nproject plan to be available to you.\n\n236\n00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.140\nNo matter where you go on this planet,\n\n237\n00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.490\nyou don't want to carry\naround a little USB key.\n\n238\n00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.780\nWell you have access to Office OneDrive,\n\n239\n00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.600\nit's integrated right into Project,\nto allow you to save it there and\n\n240\n00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.910\nthen that way you can access that\nparticular project plan anywhere.\n\n241\n00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.340\nLet me show you at least where it goes.\n\n242\n00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.410\nI didn't actually create an account,\nbut let's show you what happens here.\n\n243\n00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.680\nSo if you needed to save this,\nwell normally what we would do,\n\n244\n00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.530\na simple file and save as.\n\n245\n00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.200\nAnd from that point you would normally\nsave it to your computer into your\n\n246\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.210\ndocuments and there you go.\n\n247\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.290\nYou have and it's ready for you to go.\n\n248\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.060\nBut now if you go to another\ncomputer that project\n\n249\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.200\nplan is not going to be available to you.\n\n250\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.770\nBut if you are able to\nsign in with your account.\n\n251\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.740\nAnd you actually do have something like\nOneDrive ready and available to go.\n\n252\n00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.290\nYou sign in and\nthat ties you into your account and\n\n253\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.490\nthat's there on Microsoft's OneDrive.\n\n254\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.250\nWell then you can select one drive and\nconnect in, and\n\n255\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.530\nyou'll save inside of\nyour OneDrive account.\n\n256\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.890\nAnd that way you can go to any other\ncomputer and you've logged in and\n\n257\n00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.950\nyour ID shows up over here.\n\n258\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.480\nYou click on one drive it's just like you\nconnected to your own Storage right there.\n\n259\n00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.000\nAnd you're ready to pull it down.\n\n260\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.910\nMakes it very handy.\n\n261\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.600\n>> The biggest advantage to this is that\nit's basically being stored offsite,\n\n262\n00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.020\nstored on Microsoft servers.\n\n263\n00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.900\nSo if your hard drive fails, if your\nlaptop gets stolen, if you just have to\n\n264\n00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.540\nuse somebody else's computer temporarily,\nyou've got access to your files.\n\n265\n00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.070\nIt's up there.\n\n266\n00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:15.630\nIt's backed up.\n\n267\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.670\nIt's in the cloud.\n\n268\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.030\nAnd that's kind of a nice feature to have.\n\n269\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.400\nNow, if you have sensitive data inside\nyour project, you might want to,\n\n270\n00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.020\nnot want to do that, but\nthat is one way to go about it.\n\n271\n00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.680\nNow, the cool thing about OneDrive is\nits integrated right into Project.\n\n272\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.350\nBut you can use other cloud\nstorage methods, too.\n\n273\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:35.760\nYou can use things like Google Drive,\nor Dropbox, or whatever.\n\n274\n00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.210\nYou just have to be careful about if\n\n275\n00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.220\nmore than one person accesses\nthe file at the same time.\n\n276\n00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.650\nRight?\nBecause these programs work by\n\n277\n00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.020\nsynchronizing changes back up to a server.\n\n278\n00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.770\nIf two different people are making\nchanges at the same time\n\n279\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.450\nwe've got a real problem, right?\n\n280\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.100\nAnd it doesn't work out so well.\n\n281\n00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.910\nSo if you are single project\nmanager by yourself.\n\n282\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:55.890\nStoring it in OneDrive,\n\n283\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.220\nstoring it in cloud storage like\nthat works out really well.\n\n284\n00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.200\nIf you've got a team of\nproject managers though,\n\n285\n00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.110\nthat's not what they want us to use,\nis it, Ronnie?\n\n286\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.910\n>> No, if you have a team of project\nmanagers, the whole goal, of course,\n\n287\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.940\nis to use the project server.\n\n288\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.980\nAnd that actually integrates with a larger\nprogram in the background that we\n\n289\n00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.880\ncall SharePoint.\n\n290\n00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.192\nAnd, Don, you love SharePoint.\n\n291\n00:14:13.192 --> 00:14:14.866\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know how amazing that\n\n292\n00:14:14.866 --> 00:14:15.780\nproduct really is.\n\n293\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.290\nBut overall though,\nthat's really the goal, is for\n\n294\n00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.470\nyou to be able to do that, because it\nreally does track things very well.\n\n295\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.980\nIt allows you to actually be able\nto use multiple project managers,\n\n296\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.440\nas well as multiple projects, and\nhave that shared pool of resources.\n\n297\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.130\nIt is a great feature, but if you're\nlike me and you're only doing one or\n\n298\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.170\ntwo projects a year, maybe not the overall\nsolution I'm gonna implement for myself.\n\n299\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.750\n>> Yeah.\nYeah,\n\n300\n00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.240\nif you're in an organization with\nmultiple project managers though,\n\n301\n00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.750\nyou will want SharePoint Server.\n\n302\n00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.130\nIt's really impressive software,\n\n303\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.580\nit is a super mega pain in the butt to get\nit set up and running, it's a challenge,\n\n304\n00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.830\nit'll take a couple IT guys,\nit'll take a couple of servers.\n\n305\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.850\nIt's not for the faint hearted, but\n\n306\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.180\nfortunately with Office 365 we can get\nMicrosoft to host it for us, at which\n\n307\n00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.070\npoint it's just a matter of clicking a few\nbuttons and it's set up and it's running.\n\n308\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.620\nThe cool part about Project Sever is your\nprojects are stored up on the server.\n\n309\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.260\nThey're not stored on a fille share,\nthey're not stored on OneDrive,\n\n310\n00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.990\nthey're stored up on this\nserver in Microsoft Cloud.\n\n311\n00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:14.280\nAnd you can have 1 project manager or\n100 project managers\n\n312\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.730\nall in the same project at\nthe same time all making changes.\n\n313\n00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.110\nAnd they see each other's changes.\n\n314\n00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.600\nThey see it all reflected in realtime.\n\n315\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.850\nAnd so it works really, really well for\nthat, for the team kind of systems.\n\n316\n00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.480\nIt also allows you to have calendars that\nare synchronized into Microsoft Exchange.\n\n317\n00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.780\nSo when you create an activity and\n\n318\n00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.320\nyou assign a resource to it,\nit becomes a task on their calendar.\n\n319\n00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.350\nThey see it just right in\nthe regular workflows routine.\n\n320\n00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.180\nYou get really tight\nintegration with that.\n\n321\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.070\nIt is expensive.\n\n322\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.080\nWe won't beat around the bush on that.\n\n323\n00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.000\nBut the trade-off for the cost is that\nyou get some great flexibility and\n\n324\n00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.610\nsome really improved productivity.\n\n325\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.720\nIt's impressive stuff, right?\n\n326\n00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.460\nNow for\n\n327\n00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.390\nthis exam they don't expect you really to\nknow anything at all about Project Server.\n\n328\n00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.110\nBut we thought it was\n\n329\n00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.720\nimportant to make sure that you\nguys know about that product.\n\n330\n00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.510\nBecause if you are dealing with a team,\nyou will want to have that.\n\n331\n00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.630\n>> And it is,\nit's neat to be able to do that.\n\n332\n00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.760\nBut then with the Office365, say,\nhey, I'll pay for that feature, and\n\n333\n00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.180\nall you're doing is you're connecting to\nit, not having set up the background or\n\n334\n00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.910\nthe backside of it is really\nkind of a nice thing that I\n\n335\n00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.210\nwould probably pay for any day.\n\n336\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.140\n>> Oh, and we should also mention that\n>> The standard version of\n\n337\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.650\nproject cannot connect\nto a project server.\n\n338\n00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.430\nIf you have a project server and you want\nto connect to it with Microsoft project\n\n339\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.380\nwith client you have to buy\nthe pro version of it which is\n\n340\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.350\na good bit more expensive but only the\nproject managers need it everybody else\n\n341\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.060\ncan just use the web interface for\nproject server they don't need the client.\n\n342\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.110\nSo, your P M's they're going to need\nthe expensive version of project\n\n343\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.240\nEverybody else doesn't need Project at\nall, they just go to the website and\n\n344\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.200\nthey run it from there.\n\n345\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.080\nSo that does actually make\nlife a little bit easier.\n\n346\n00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.820\n>> It really does, and it's something that\nwe want to make sure that we understand\n\n347\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.100\nthat, and take advantage of\nwhen the time comes right, too.\n\n348\n00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.920\nAnd another extension that we also\nwant to point out is the ability for\n\n349\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.610\nus to go to Microsoft Office itself And\nbe able to pull from some of the templates\n\n350\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.160\nthat were developed out there for\nMicrosoft Project as well.\n\n351\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.430\nAnd theres a couple of\nways where we can do that.\n\n352\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.530\nIf you take your browser, you can browse\nto Office, I just browse to Office.com And\n\n353\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.840\nthat brought me to Office live.com,\nand from here, here it is.\n\n354\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.310\nThe Office online store and,\nor the Office online site.\n\n355\n00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.570\nAnd notice up here in the upper right hand\ncorner, we have the ability to go and\n\n356\n00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.300\nsearch for templates.\n\n357\n00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.150\nAnd, once we do that,\n\n358\n00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.360\nand most of these you notice they\nactually talk about free templates.\n\n359\n00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.030\nI noticed that you can also browse\nby products over here on the side.\n\n360\n00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.010\nAnd over here,\n\n361\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:38.000\nit doesn't look like it actually gives\nwhat I'm, Microsoft Object by default.\n\n362\n00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.900\nAnd so from there,\nI'd have to go and do a search.\n\n363\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.940\nNow, you can do that.\n\n364\n00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.340\nYou can search out the ones and\nwhat you are generally looking for,\n\n365\n00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.120\nsearching in search terms, is something\nlike propose project Project management,\n\n366\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.680\nanything like that is what\nyou wanna be able to do and\n\n367\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.430\nthen it will bring you to those filtered\nlists if you wanna do it on the browser\n\n368\n00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:00.290\nbut the nice thing is Microsoft Project\nassumes that more than likely this is\n\n369\n00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:06.000\nsomething that is so helpful that they\nwant to put it directly on Project itself.\n\n370\n00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.970\nSo, when I click on Project And\nI go to New on the, so\n\n371\n00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:15.020\nI select File and\nI go to New, it's right here.\n\n372\n00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.280\nThey went ahead and began to pre-select\nsome of the templates for me.\n\n373\n00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.170\nAnd notice it says it's connected\nin to Office Online templates, and\n\n374\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.620\nit even gives me some suggested\nsearches down here, too.\n\n375\n00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.670\nAnd I can click on this first one for\nproject management When I do that, it goes\n\n376\n00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:34.860\nahead and scrolls in, and filters it down,\nand notice over on the right hand side,\n\n377\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.950\nI get a category over here, and it tells\nme that there's 81 possible templates\n\n378\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:45.230\nthat they actually have listed underneath\nthis, project management type of search.\n\n379\n00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:49.060\nAnd so when I can use that,\nit is going ahead and\n\n380\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.510\ngiving me the ability To not\nhave to start from scratch.\n\n381\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.400\nTo be able to use those templates that\nare there, and that gives me a head start\n\n382\n00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.630\non a lot of different things that I\nmay not know exactly how to start, but\n\n383\n00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.930\nthen I can go and take a look at\nsome of these different plans and\n\n384\n00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.190\nstart using them as well.\n\n385\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.680\nSo take advantage of those\ntemplates that are out there,\n\n386\n00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.580\nbecause they will help you to at\nleast get a nice little start.\n\n387\n00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.390\nWhen you're not exactly sure how to\nstart on any one particular project.\n\n388\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:18.130\n>> Absolutely, and we've used some of\nthose in the other parts of the show and\n\n389\n00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.360\nyou can always go out and\ndownload templates from other people.\n\n390\n00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.750\nI know, there's a few different\nwebsites that I've used over the years.\n\n391\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.350\nWhere you can go and download some\ngreat templates from other people\n\n392\n00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.400\njust to kind of get to that kick start so\n\n393\n00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.460\nyou don't have to create things from\nthe very beginning on your own.\n\n394\n00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:37.230\n>> The other extensibility that we have is\nthe ability to automate certain tasks that\n\n395\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.590\nwe have to do over and over again, or\nthat we want to do over and over again.\n\n396\n00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:45.440\nSo if you've ever used Microsoft Excel,\nand\n\n397\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.900\nyou've actually run things like Macros.\n\n398\n00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:53.300\nIn the background A macro is\nactually writing some type of visual\n\n399\n00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.400\nbasic scripting.\n\n400\n00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.660\nI couldn't remember what it was called.\n\n401\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.140\nBut, it's called VBA, right,\nvisual basic for applications.\n\n402\n00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.170\nWhat's happening with that visual\nbasic for applications is simple.\n\n403\n00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.410\nIt's recording what I'm Pointing and\nclicking at.\n\n404\n00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.380\nIn other words,\neverything I'm putting on screen and\n\n405\n00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.140\nturning it into some scripting\ncode in the background.\n\n406\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.110\nWe normally use things like that to\nautomate certain things that we have to do\n\n407\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.290\nover and over again.\n\n408\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.570\nSo let me show you an example of\nwhat I'm talking about here, okay?\n\n409\n00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.220\nSo on my screen, let's say that what I\nwanted to do is at the end of every day as\n\n410\n00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:27.700\nI'm tracking this project And I just want\nto see the critical path being displayed.\n\n411\n00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.790\nAnd so what I normally would\nhave to do from this point,\n\n412\n00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:34.500\nright, is to be able to go ahead and\nfilter this thing down and\n\n413\n00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.600\njust as a simple,\nsee I've even forgotten where I was.\n\n414\n00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.690\nView, and then I can go to the data\ngroup and I can select Filter and\n\n415\n00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:47.070\ngo to Critical and when I do that,\nlet me select this task right here,\n\n416\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.820\nand I'll do the scroll task.\n\n417\n00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.940\nAnd there it is, okay?\n\n418\n00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.320\nSo there's my critical path,\naccording to the filtering.\n\n419\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.340\nOh, I also forgot the formatting here.\n\n420\n00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.960\nSo I can see it in red.\n\n421\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.020\nSo, I can do stuff like that.\n\n422\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.100\nAnd I do that every day.\n\n423\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.340\nIf I leave that on,\nthat's perfectly fine, but\n\n424\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.190\nI'd still have to scroll down and\nsee that.\n\n425\n00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.070\nWhat if I wanted to at the end of\nthe day to have something like that,\n\n426\n00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:13.310\nif I just wanted to click on something and\nmake it do that entire series of\n\n427\n00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:18.280\nwhatever I wanted, and have it displayed\nas a little graphic for me instead.\n\n428\n00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.800\nWell, I can record all those steps And\n\n429\n00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.940\nthen just click on something to do that or\nattach it to a shortcut key and\n\n430\n00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.150\nthen it will run it for me and\ndo what we're talking about.\n\n431\n00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.320\nSo that's what we want to go ahead and\nset up and do.\n\n432\n00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.810\nSo I'm gonna uncheck that and\nthen go back to my view and\n\n433\n00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:40.150\nI'll just take the filter off so\nwe kind of start from scratch here.\n\n434\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:41.600\nTo be able to do something like that.\n\n435\n00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.050\nIf I knew that I was gonna\nbe doing that every day,\n\n436\n00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.670\nor let's say I was going to be doing\nit in the morning and in the afternoon,\n\n437\n00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.950\nbecause I was managing a task in that way\nand wanted to see what was happening.\n\n438\n00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.320\nWell, we can do the same thing and the way\nthat we do that is by taking advantage of\n\n439\n00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:00.650\na macro button to right here\nunderneath view is where it is.\n\n440\n00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.780\nSo if you select view,\n\n441\n00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.600\nover on the right-hand side you'll\nsee this grouping called macros.\n\n442\n00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.660\nNow, inside of macros, macros, remember,\n\n443\n00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.130\nis actually scripting that's running\ninside your application, and\n\n444\n00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.410\nthat's something you have to be\ncareful about With Microsoft Office,\n\n445\n00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:18.460\nthey don't really like a lot of macros\nrunning because this is how they got,\n\n446\n00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.550\nyou know, some different viruses and\nsome different things that were happening\n\n447\n00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.480\ninside of their programs and\nbit earlier in Office's life.\n\n448\n00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.190\nSo notice they have\na macro-security button.\n\n449\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.750\nIf I select Macro security, you'll see\nthat the That the default right here\n\n450\n00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.290\nis disable all macros\nwithout notification.\n\n451\n00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:39.750\nSo if you want to actually make\nsure that these macros will run,\n\n452\n00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.610\nyou might want to go ahead and\nchange this as well.\n\n453\n00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.620\nSo I wanna enable all the macros for now.\n\n454\n00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.110\nIt says not recommended,\npotentially dangerous code can run.\n\n455\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.040\nThey do have some other\noptions available for\n\n456\n00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.970\nyou such as digitally signed ones\ncan run but not anything else.\n\n457\n00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.740\nThat may be an option that\nyou choose to run here,\n\n458\n00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.700\nbut since we're creating our own,\nwe're gonna enable the macro for\n\n459\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.310\nright now for here and click OK.\n\n460\n00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.830\nSo when we have something\nlike that now ready to go,\n\n461\n00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.490\nthen I need to go back to View and\nselect Macros again.\n\n462\n00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.310\nAnd then I can go ahead and\nrecord my macro.\n\n463\n00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:16.760\nSo if I select record,\nI now need to give it a macro name and\n\n464\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.650\nhere's something that is important.\n\n465\n00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:23.250\nMacro names cannot have spaces,\nnor can the first letter be, or\n\n466\n00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.485\nthe first character, be a Number,\nit has to be a letter and\n\n467\n00:23:27.485 --> 00:23:29.735\nit has to actually have no spaces in it.\n\n468\n00:23:29.735 --> 00:23:31.275\nSo if you actually do\nsee a space in there,\n\n469\n00:23:31.275 --> 00:23:34.005\nit's gonna bok at you to do something.\n\n470\n00:23:34.005 --> 00:23:36.305\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n471\n00:23:36.305 --> 00:23:42.835\nSo if I do one critical like that,\njust as an example, and I click OK.\n\n472\n00:23:42.835 --> 00:23:46.785\nSays, hey that's not a valid macro name,\nso it doesn't like it.\n\n473\n00:23:46.785 --> 00:23:51.240\nIf I actually have one with spaces in\nit It's not going to do it as well, so\n\n474\n00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.630\nI'm just gonna call it CriticalPath\nis what I'm going to call it.\n\n475\n00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:00.980\nNow, we can create a shortcut with this,\nCtrl and a letter, The problem that I have\n\n476\n00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.480\nis I never remember all those letters that\nare actually available for a shortcut.\n\n477\n00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.410\nSo, if you're like me, you actually go,\noh, I'm gonna do a CTRL+C for critical.\n\n478\n00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:13.060\nWell, that may not work since\nCTRL+C normally is cut, so\n\n479\n00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.230\nyou might wanna pick something\nelse if you're gonna do that.\n\n480\n00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.630\nI'm just gonna use the button cuz I can't\n\n481\n00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.500\nremember which ones\nactually are not there.\n\n482\n00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.680\nAnd I like putting the description here,\nI'm gonna put show, or display,\n\n483\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:30.560\ncritical path in a gif format,\ncuz I know I can do that.\n\n484\n00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.640\nI can copy an image of this picture and\nbe able to do that as well.\n\n485\n00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.940\nOn these rows and columns,\nit's actually saying, hey,\n\n486\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.760\nwhat do you want this macro to\nactually run relative and absolute?\n\n487\n00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.340\nThese are the defaults that\nthey've set up for us and\n\n488\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.160\nfrom that point, I just click OK.\n\n489\n00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.330\nNow, you don't have to be in a hurry\nabout anything, but when you do this,\n\n490\n00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.890\ncuz I used to think, oh, you have\nto do this as quickly as you can or\n\n491\n00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.890\nit's gonna take ten minutes for\nit to run the macro.\n\n492\n00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.310\nIt is actually just waiting for\n\n493\n00:24:56.310 --> 00:25:00.420\nme to actually execute what\nI want it to have happen.\n\n494\n00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.940\nSo from this point, we're in\nthe midst of creating our macro, so\n\n495\n00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.980\nwhat I want to do is I wanna go ahead and\njust display the critical path.\n\n496\n00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.980\nSo from this point,\nI can go back to View, and\n\n497\n00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.800\nI can select my filtering and\ngo down to critical.\n\n498\n00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.190\nAnd then I'm going to\ndo my scroll to task.\n\n499\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.670\nOops, let me select the right\nscroll to task here.\n\n500\n00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:29.530\nAnd I noticed that this is not in red,\nand I want it to display it in red.\n\n501\n00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.860\nI'm going to select critical\ntask at this point, and\n\n502\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.540\nI'll scroll that over just a little bit.\n\n503\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:40.050\nOnce I have that, I wanna take a picture\nof this and save it to my desktop.\n\n504\n00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.160\nSo, I click on Task.\n\n505\n00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.960\nAnd I select Copy and\nthe little drop down arrow beside Copy.\n\n506\n00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.800\nAnd I go to Copy Picture.\n\n507\n00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.786\nFrom this point,\nI'm gonna render it as a gif image, and\n\n508\n00:25:50.786 --> 00:25:52.850\nI'm gonna have it saved on my desktop.\n\n509\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.490\nSo that way, if I close out a project,\nI can still see my critical path.\n\n510\n00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.270\nFrom that point, I can use a time scale,\n\n511\n00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:00.620\nwhat's shown on the screen or\nfrom this date.\n\n512\n00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.270\nYou can also set all that stuff up for\nyou as well.\n\n513\n00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.780\nSo I might do shown on screen.\n\n514\n00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.955\nAnd then I'm going to click OK.\n\n515\n00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:10.640\nAnd I'm gonna overwrite the file.\n\n516\n00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.200\nI've already done this before.\n\n517\n00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.630\nSo we can see that.\n\n518\n00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:14.600\nAnd once you do that, and\n\n519\n00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.080\neverything is actually done, well,\nyou don't have to finish it.\n\n520\n00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.000\nI don't wanna leave it at this view.\n\n521\n00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.530\nI wanna just kinda change it back.\n\n522\n00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.800\nSo let's say that I wanna go ahead and\njust take the filter off.\n\n523\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.010\nI might leave the highlighting there.\n\n524\n00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.620\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n525\n00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.660\nAnd then, I just stop recording the macro.\n\n526\n00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:32.770\nAll right.\n\n527\n00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.550\nSo now that I've stopped recording\nthe macro, what do we do?\n\n528\n00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.790\nWell, all I have to do then\nis go back to macro and\n\n529\n00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.550\nthen I, oops,\nI actually have a couple of them here.\n\n530\n00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:47.880\nAnd I run that, click, all right.\n\n531\n00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.640\n>> And you're having to click over\njust because you already had that file\n\n532\n00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.050\ngenerated, so yep.\n\n533\n00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.060\n>> And then there it is.\n\n534\n00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.998\nThere is the critical path right there and\nready for me that I should be able to see.\n\n535\n00:26:58.998 --> 00:27:01.270\nIt's not gonna generate a ton\nof different things, but\n\n536\n00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.880\nwhat if that's all that I needed to see?\n\n537\n00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.320\nBefore I went home, I was like, okay.\n\n538\n00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.320\nHere's what we have ready to go, and\nhere's what I need to adjust for\n\n539\n00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.320\nthe day and we are ready to go.\n\n540\n00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.710\nNow, remember what's going on\nin the background, though.\n\n541\n00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:18.020\nLet me show you here,\nif I can get back to that macro, and\n\n542\n00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.380\nI go to View Macros,\nselect that first one and go to Edit.\n\n543\n00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:31.600\nIt's right here that we have that macro\nthat I was just selected on here.\n\n544\n00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.900\nNow, if you're good at actually\nunderstanding the visual basic stuff,\n\n545\n00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:39.838\nyou can come in here and re-modify\nthese dates and selected rows and\n\n546\n00:27:39.838 --> 00:27:43.070\nwhere it actually applies, and\nenter all that stuff in there.\n\n547\n00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.550\nBut if you're like me,\nyou're not that good at it,\n\n548\n00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.010\nand so you just go, okay, I'm just glad\nit worked in the way that I wanted it to.\n\n549\n00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.652\nBut if you're really good at it,\nhere's the way to go.\n\n550\n00:27:49.652 --> 00:27:53.024\n>> Yeah, now the key thing here\nis to remember that the VBA,\n\n551\n00:27:53.024 --> 00:27:54.990\nright, Visual Basic for Applications,\n\n552\n00:27:54.990 --> 00:28:00.450\nis a subset of Microsoft's Visual Basic\nProgramming language in compilation suite.\n\n553\n00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:05.790\nSo, once you're in there,\nyou can do practically anything.\n\n554\n00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.260\nIf you have developers on staff, or\nif you have contract developers available,\n\n555\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.465\nthey can write extensions that\ncan do darn near anything.\n\n556\n00:28:12.465 --> 00:28:16.235\nSo you might have a completely\nproprietary backend accounting system\n\n557\n00:28:16.235 --> 00:28:20.135\nthat nobody out there is gonna write\na connector for to connect to a project.\n\n558\n00:28:20.135 --> 00:28:24.853\nWell, they could come in here, and through\nVBA, start to write in these links to say,\n\n559\n00:28:24.853 --> 00:28:29.030\nall right, well, when you run this macro,\nright, that's kinda what's gonna trigger\n\n560\n00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.280\nthis, we'll go through project and\nwe'll look for all of our costs.\n\n561\n00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.370\nAnd we'll change them into this format and\n\n562\n00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.880\nsend them to that accounting\nsoftware on the backend.\n\n563\n00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.060\nOr vice versa, we'll grab things from\nthe other side and bring it back in.\n\n564\n00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.550\nThe skies are the limits,\nonce you're in this little section,\n\n565\n00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.870\na developer can go crazy, right?\n\n566\n00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.230\nAnd you can link all sorts\nof stuff in the project.\n\n567\n00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.280\nFor us, as project managers,\nwe're probably not gonna make use\n\n568\n00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.146\nof the VBA side of things very much,\nright, because we're not developers.\n\n569\n00:28:56.146 --> 00:28:58.350\nBut we wanted to make sure we\nshowed that here in the episode,\n\n570\n00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.960\nbecause it's important\nyou know it's there.\n\n571\n00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.270\nA lot of people don't even\nrealize it's there, and\n\n572\n00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.480\nthat's not just a project thing.\n\n573\n00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.720\nIt's there in Excel and even Word,\nif you really wanna go crazy.\n\n574\n00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.842\nI can't really think of a reason\nwhy I'd use it in Word,\n\n575\n00:29:07.842 --> 00:29:08.370\nbut-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n576\n00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.190\n>> In Excel, you certainly can.\n\n577\n00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.020\nSo, it's just a great way\nto be able to extend out.\n\n578\n00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.330\nAnd what you'll find is that a lot of\nthose plug ins that we've showed earlier\n\n579\n00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.540\nin the show, they're pretty expensive.\n\n580\n00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.180\nAnd at the end of the day, all they are\nare VBA apps that have been written and\n\n581\n00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.800\ntacked in there, but\nwhat you're paying for\n\n582\n00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.890\nis the fact that they've\nalready developed it.\n\n583\n00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.450\nSo when you look at that extension and\n\n584\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.250\nyou say, man, it's $400,\nthat's a lot of money.\n\n585\n00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:33.590\nWell, how much would it cost you to\nhire a developer to write it for you?\n\n586\n00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.030\nIt'd be thousands of dollars.\n\n587\n00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.927\nThat $400 is all of a sudden\na lot more affordable.\n\n588\n00:29:37.927 --> 00:29:39.990\nAnd when there's a problem, you know\nyou can just reach out to them for\n\n589\n00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.480\nsupport versus you having to deal with it.\n\n590\n00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.900\nSo there's pros and cons there,\nbut basically Microsoft\n\n591\n00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.530\nleaves that open where you can take it and\nrun with it which is pretty awesome.\n\n592\n00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.390\n>> There's only one other thing I wanted\nto show you that I just noticed when I was\n\n593\n00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:54.420\nshowing the macro is that I\nsaved it in the wrong place,\n\n594\n00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.730\nDon, is what ended up happening here.\n\n595\n00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:01.270\nAnd I didn't realize until I\nfinished it and it said global.mpt.\n\n596\n00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.080\nWhat I wanted to show you is right here,\nand I should have slowed down.\n\n597\n00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.340\nI was just in a hurry.\n\n598\n00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.890\nIf I click on Record Macro, notice it\nactually gives me the ability to store\n\n599\n00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.530\nthe macro in certain places, all right.\n\n600\n00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.210\nAnd this is what you want to\npay attention to as well.\n\n601\n00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.930\nIf I store it in that global file,\nthat's gonna store it in the template.\n\n602\n00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.390\nThat means every project\nyou create from right now\n\n603\n00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.360\nis also gonna have that\nparticular macro in there too.\n\n604\n00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.760\nAnd that's perfectly fine if that's\nwhat you want to be able to do.\n\n605\n00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.890\nBut if you want to make sure that it's\nactually only affecting your file and\n\n606\n00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.720\nthat no one else is gonna use it,\nyou wanna change it to this project.\n\n607\n00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.990\nAnd that way, it only stores it on\nthat project plan file as well.\n\n608\n00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:40.720\nThat could be something that comes up.\n\n609\n00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.010\nBut it is something that we do want\nto make sure that we do understand.\n\n610\n00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:48.900\nBecause if not, and we store it in that\nglobal template and now Don comes in with\n\n611\n00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.860\na project server, he says, I don't\nknow what this macro's about, delete.\n\n612\n00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.530\nAnd there it goes.\n\n613\n00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.100\nIt's gone.\n\n614\n00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.490\nIt's gone for everybody.\n\n615\n00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:59.420\nAnd I'm like no, I needed that macro.\n\n616\n00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.310\nBut there it is.\n\n617\n00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:03.250\nSo make sure you actually know exactly\nwhere it's gonna store it when you do\n\n618\n00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.380\nstuff like this.\n\n619\n00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.750\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n620\n00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:08.670\nAll right, well Ronnie, I think that's a\npretty good rundown of all the stuff that\n\n621\n00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:12.240\nwe can make Project do that it\nwasn't intended to do, right?\n\n622\n00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.290\nSo just recognize that when you feel\nlimited by Project Whiz just not\n\n623\n00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:19.570\ndoing something you want it to do,\nthere are alternatives out there.\n\n624\n00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.510\nThere's ways to extend\nthat functionality and\n\n625\n00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:25.950\nreally turn it into the perfect\nproject management suite for you,\n\n626\n00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:29.920\nnot just the perfect project management\nsuite that Microsoft envisions it being.\n\n627\n00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.160\nIt can be customized.\n\n628\n00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.120\nAnd so it's really pretty impressive.\n\n629\n00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:33.900\n>> It is.\n\n630\n00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.820\nAnd the more that you play with it,\n\n631\n00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.130\nthe more you realize how\nmuch you can do with it.\n\n632\n00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.466\nIt is, and I cannot say it.\n\n633\n00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:43.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Impressive by the least.\n\n634\n00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:46.530\nI was trying to say insanely impressive,\nand it just wouldn't come out.\n\n635\n00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.200\n>> Insanely impressive.\n\n636\n00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:47.780\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n637\n00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.990\n>> Well, I don't think we can go anywhere\n\n638\n00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.260\nabove insanely impressive.\n\n639\n00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.030\nSo that's probably a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap this episode up.\n\n640\n00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.860\nWe hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n641\n00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.950\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n642\n00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:59.520\n>> I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n643\n00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.200\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n644\n00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.120\n[SOUND]\n\n",
