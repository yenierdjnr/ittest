          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.770\n[SOUND] In this video,\nwe're gonna take a minute to talk\n\n2\n00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.501\nabout the Microsoft Project certification.\n\n3\n00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.960\nIn particular,\nwe will get a little detail here.\n\n4\n00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.835\nThe 74-343 exam which, for those of\nyou that are wanting to learn how to\n\n5\n00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:24.490\nuse the Microsoft Project software,\nit really is a great place to start.\n\n6\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.590\nYou can jump right in, you can get\na great certification out of it.\n\n7\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.430\nOnce you've learned the material and\nyou've passed the exam,\n\n8\n00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.460\nyou get the Microsoft Certified\nProfessional, or MCP certification.\n\n9\n00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.030\nSo I mean, this is really a great thing.\n\n10\n00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.540\nNot just for project managers, but anybody\nwho works in a project environment.\n\n11\n00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.710\nTo be able to learn the software and\nget a certification at the same time.\n\n12\n00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.310\nI really enjoy this one.\n\n13\n00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.790\n>> Yeah, with Microsoft Project 2013,\nwe can actually go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.630\ntake a look at their exam objectives.\n\n15\n00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.750\nOn my screen I went ahead and\n\n16\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.130\npulled up the exam objectives\nfrom Microsoft's site itself.\n\n17\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.820\nAnd you can see that it gives you a lot\nof information right here at the top,\n\n18\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.652\nmost importantly for me normally\nis gonna be, of course, the cost.\n\n19\n00:01:01.652 --> 00:01:03.558\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The cost has gone up a little\n\n20\n00:01:03.558 --> 00:01:04.750\nbit over time.\n\n21\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.680\nAbout $150, US dollars of course,\nis what you can do.\n\n22\n00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.800\nAnd if you have Microsoft Project 2013,\nthey have the certification for that.\n\n23\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.270\nYou may still see that there's still\nMicrosoft Project 2010 as a possibility,\n\n24\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.570\nbut the older editions have\npretty much gone away,\n\n25\n00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.480\nthey've been deprecated at this point.\n\n26\n00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.910\nSo those exams will no longer count.\n\n27\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.152\nBut if you scroll down,\n\n28\n00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:28.709\nfrom this point here you can actually\nthen see the skills measured.\n\n29\n00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.860\nAnd this is what we\nreally wanna focus in on,\n\n30\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.177\nis to take a look at some of these\ndifferent exam objectives to help us\n\n31\n00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:37.540\nto be able to understand what\nthey're gonna ask us about.\n\n32\n00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.700\nAs well as to help us did it to\nfigure out how a project actually\n\n33\n00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.860\nworks in the betterment of\nactually doing project management.\n\n34\n00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.870\nSo, the first field that we're\nactually taking a look at in the exam\n\n35\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.980\nobjectives here is going to\nbe initializing a project.\n\n36\n00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.430\nNow a project really wants you to actually\nknow how to get a project that you've\n\n37\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.510\nalready got all the information for\nand get started as soon as you can.\n\n38\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.280\nSo in that project initialization,\n\n39\n00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.510\nwe're going to talk about things\nlike just how do we actually get\n\n40\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.980\nthe project started in order to show\nsome of the different ways to do so.\n\n41\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.920\nAnd the basic information that we\nneed just so that we can begin.\n\n42\n00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.560\n>> Yeah, and I\n\n43\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.860\nreally like the way Microsoft's\narranged the objectives on this one.\n\n44\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.730\nBecause you'll notice where it starts\nwith is just creating a blank project.\n\n45\n00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.170\nThey're not expecting you to have any\nprior knowledge of Microsoft Project,\n\n46\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.180\nyou don't have to have worked with it for\nyears to jump in and do this one.\n\n47\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.460\nSo if you've never used\nProject even a single time,\n\n48\n00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.550\nwell we're gonna start out\nright there at that beginning.\n\n49\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.070\nOpening the program, creating that first\nproject, and getting moving forward, so\n\n50\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.600\nreally, really useful stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.250\nAnd for the rest of the objectives,\n\n52\n00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.270\nMicrosoft really stayed true to the stuff\nyou're really gonna use type topics.\n\n53\n00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.890\nNot the esoteric, weird features that\nmost people don't work with, but\n\n54\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.192\nthe features that are really important to\neverybody who serves as a project manager\n\n55\n00:02:46.192 --> 00:02:48.930\nor just works within\na project environment.\n\n56\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.190\nSo, for example, the very second\nobjective is well, scheduling, right?\n\n57\n00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.780\nWhich is really important, it's a key\npiece of what a project manager does for\n\n58\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.310\na living, but it's also important for\nanybody who participates in that project.\n\n59\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.280\nA project is broken up\ninto multiple tasks.\n\n60\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.850\nAnd how do we make sure those tasks are\noccurring on time, you know at completion?\n\n61\n00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.860\nHow do we know if we're getting behind\nschedule or if we're ahead of schedule?\n\n62\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.380\nWe need to be able to understand that and\nMicrosoft Project can help us do that.\n\n63\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.170\n>> All right, it's a great place for us to\nat least get all of the tasks that we have\n\n64\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.190\nready to go and put it in one place.\n\n65\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.610\nThen that way we can see it.\n\n66\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.070\nAnd we'll end up seeing that once\nwe talk about creating a basic,\n\n67\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.570\na task based schedule.\n\n68\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.870\nWe'll then be able to\nstart manipulating it and\n\n69\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.020\nchanging it into the information\nthat we really need.\n\n70\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.490\nSo they go into simple things like setting\nup some basic information that we need for\n\n71\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.250\nthe overall project, and\n\n72\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.520\neven setting up what we'll call\nthe project task structure, and\n\n73\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.560\nthen logically structuring everything\nthe way that it needs to be done.\n\n74\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.080\nThe nice thing about Project is you\ncan just throw stuff in it, and\n\n75\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.460\nthen later on work with it and massage it\ninto what you actually would like to see.\n\n76\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.190\n>> Yeah, now, the third objective\nis our resource management.\n\n77\n00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.940\nOnce you've created all these tasks,\n\n78\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.100\nsomebody has to actually do the work,\nright?\n\n79\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.000\nSo we need to assign people to the tasks\nto do it, or maybe it's not people.\n\n80\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.770\nMaybe it's equipment,\nmachinery, other things,\n\n81\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.662\nother resources that we have to manage.\n\n82\n00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:12.970\nWe need to keep track of that to make\nsure that we don't do any kind of\n\n83\n00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.210\nover allocation.\n\n84\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.870\nI don't want to book Ronnie to\ndo two things at the same time.\n\n85\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.790\nSo we gotta make sure that we can have\nthat in an easy to see environment,\n\n86\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.530\nthat helps us to locate area's\nwhere we've got problems.\n\n87\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.620\nWhere we don't have enough resources, or\n\n88\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.440\nwe've over allocated somebody and\ncreated an issue.\n\n89\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.630\nSo, that's what the third\nobjective is all about.\n\n90\n00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.960\nAs we scroll down I can see that\nthe fourth objective takes a look at\n\n91\n00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.880\ntracking and analyzing a project itself.\n\n92\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.480\nOnce we get everything in place inside\nthe project, we know actually start seeing\n\n93\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.920\nthe power of Microsoft project\nto display what we need to.\n\n94\n00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.190\nSo that what we can do is we can\ntake the information out of Project,\n\n95\n00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.590\nbe able to create the reports that we\nneed, be able to analyze the information,\n\n96\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.540\nand that way keep our project on\nschedule in the way that it needs to go.\n\n97\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.130\n>> Now the fifth objective, and the final\nobjective, is probably my favorite because\n\n98\n00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.960\nall this good information inside of\nMicrosoft Project is all designed for\n\n99\n00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.050\nproject managers.\n\n100\n00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.690\nMicrosoft knows that it's project\nmanagers that are gonna be using this\n\n101\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.780\nsoftware the most.\n\n102\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.540\nAnd so the terminology that's used,\nthe tools,\n\n103\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.880\nit's all built around what\nwe do as a project manager.\n\n104\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.700\nBut the rest of your company needs to be\nable to benefit from this information, and\n\n105\n00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.870\nthey don't know what a BCWP is.\n\n106\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.290\nThey don't understand planned value or\nan SPI.\n\n107\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.240\nThat stuff doesn't mean anything to them.\n\n108\n00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.880\nSo we've gotta have some way to\ntake the information in project and\n\n109\n00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.410\nget that out in a way that's meaningful to\nthe other people in our company, right?\n\n110\n00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.950\nIf I give somebody a calendar,\nthey know what a calendar is.\n\n111\n00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.570\nThey can read that.\n\n112\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.300\nThey go, this is Tuesday,\nI'm supposed to be here at this time.\n\n113\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.770\nThey understand that, right?\n\n114\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.290\nOr here's a pie chart that shows tasks\nthat are completed, and tasks that aren't.\n\n115\n00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.360\nThat's the kind of information\npeople understand.\n\n116\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.260\nAnd Project has a ton of\nways to output data and\n\n117\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.860\ntranslate it from our project management\nlanguage into regular English,\n\n118\n00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.620\nor well whatever language\nyou speak in your country.\n\n119\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.250\nInto regular easily understandable charts,\n\n120\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.040\ndiagrams, lists,\njust all sorts of different formats.\n\n121\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.410\nIt's really powerful.\n\n122\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.910\n>> It really is.\n\n123\n00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.650\nSo, those are the five objectives that\nwe're taking a look at when we go through\n\n124\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.600\nour show here, for the 74-343 show, and\nthere's a lot for us to cover, Don.\n\n125\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.240\n>> Yeah, so if that sounds exciting and\nfun to you you're in the right place.\n\n126\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.590\nStay tuned for it.\n\n127\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.240\nAlso keep in mind that this is\nusing a tool to manage projects.\n\n128\n00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.830\nIf you want to learn more about\nactually doing project management,\n\n129\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.470\njust the concepts and theory behind it,\nwe do have other training here on ITProTV\n\n130\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.310\nlike the project management\nprofessional training that we did.\n\n131\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.500\nSo check that out, too.\n\n132\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.650\nNow, the order doesn't really matter.\n\n133\n00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.470\nYou can learn the tool first and\nthen learn the fundamentals later, or\n\n134\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.210\nthe other way around.\n\n135\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.970\nBut I find it is pretty beneficial to\nalready understand the fundamentals,\n\n136\n00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.270\nif we're doing task scheduling, you should\nprobably understand the concepts behind\n\n137\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.620\nduration, resource allocation, and so on.\n\n138\n00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.940\nSo if you haven't already,\n\n139\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.530\nbe sure to check out the project\nmanagement professionals series.\n\n140\n00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.880\nIt's a great one.\n\n141\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.060\nIt was you and I Ronnie, right?\n\n142\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.959\nWe did that one.\nSo, [LAUGH] filmed it a few months ago.\n\n143\n00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.918\nSo definitely it's something\nworth checking out.\n\n144\n00:07:08.918 --> 00:07:11.583\nBut as far as Microsoft Project,\nthis is the place to be.\n\n145\n00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:14.876\nSo stay tuned,\nwe got Microsoft Project coming up next.\n\n146\n00:07:14.876 -->
