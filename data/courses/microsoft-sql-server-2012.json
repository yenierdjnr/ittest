          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:08,034\n[SOUND].\n\n2\n00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:11,585\nThis ITProTV series is designed\nto introduce the viewer to\n\n3\n00:00:11,585 --> 00:00:13,620\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2012.\n\n4\n00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,320\nMore importantly, it's designed to\nintroduce a system admin, to SQL Server.\n\n5\n00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,870\nNow a lot of people are familiar\nwith Microsoft SQL.\n\n6\n00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,280\nIt's one of the most common\ndatabase servers in the world,\n\n7\n00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,540\nyou see it very frequently used\nin a lot of organizations.\n\n8\n00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,860\nBut, as a Systems Administrator,\nyou're not a database administrator.\n\n9\n00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,150\nYou don't necessarily know\nthe inner workings of a database.\n\n10\n00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,080\nBut you might be tasked with\nthe responsibilities of maintaining, or\n\n11\n00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,590\neven installing and\ncreating that database server.\n\n12\n00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,980\nIt's a very common thing to fall into.\n\n13\n00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,600\nAs a result, Microsoft created\nan exam that was centered around,\n\n14\n00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,120\nnot the programming side of Microsoft SQL,\nbut the supporting side of it.\n\n15\n00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,430\nAnd that's what this show\nis going to be covering.\n\n16\n00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,510\nThe exam is the 70-462 exam and\n\n17\n00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,320\nthe official title is Administering\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2012 Databases.\n\n18\n00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,300\nNow there is a sister course associated\nwith this one that does get a little\n\n19\n00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,860\nmore onto the, I don't wanna call it the\ndeveloper side cuz you're not programming,\n\n20\n00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,920\nbut dealing with the SQL queries and\nall that other stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,230\nSo there is one that gets\na little more heavier into that.\n\n22\n00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,930\nBut this one,\nis specifically focused to systems admins,\n\n23\n00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,120\nthe people who are supporting Windows\nServer, who are putting the hardware\n\n24\n00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,130\nservers in the rack and\ngetting this infrastructure built up.\n\n25\n00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,880\nThey may need to bring up\ndatabase servers also.\n\n26\n00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,102\nNow you may have an entire staff of\nprogrammers who are ready to jump in there\n\n27\n00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:31,599\nand start using those databases.\n\n28\n00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,059\nBut they don't understand how to\nbackup and restore the database or\n\n29\n00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:39,060\nhow to do performance tuning of\nthe database, things like that.\n\n30\n00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,070\nThey deal on the development side.\n\n31\n00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,580\nWe as System Admins,\ndeal on the server side.\n\n32\n00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,585\nAnd so that's what we tackle for\nthis certification.\n\n33\n00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:49,895\nNow, if you look at the requirements,\nI'll just kinda scroll down here a bit.\n\n34\n00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:52,525\nYou'll see it starts out real basic\nwith things like installing and\n\n35\n00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:53,765\nconfiguring, right?\n\n36\n00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,904\nWe need to get a SQL Server up and\nrunning so\n\n37\n00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:58,855\nwe can start to create databases on it and\nwork with data.\n\n38\n00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:02,540\nSo that's exactly where it begins,\njust the initial configuration.\n\n39\n00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,370\nThen, actually creating the databases.\n\n40\n00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,510\nSomebody's gotta make it.\n\n41\n00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,610\nAnd maybe you're getting a specific spec\nsheet from your development team saying\n\n42\n00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,750\nhere's what we need.\n\n43\n00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,990\nBut often times you don't get that.\n\n44\n00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,095\nThey just say, hey,\nwe need a database server.\n\n45\n00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:19,505\nSo, we bring one up, we create the initial\ndatabases, and we get the system up.\n\n46\n00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,921\nNow we'll also take a look at clustering,\ntoo.\n\n47\n00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:24,879\nIf this is a database that needs\nto be up as often as possible,\n\n48\n00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,171\nlike high availability, well, we're gonna\nneed to take some extra precautions and so\n\n49\n00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:30,805\nwe'll see that in maintaining.\n\n50\n00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,030\nIt then goes on optimizing, right?\n\n51\n00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,540\nHow do you make the database run better?\n\n52\n00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,910\nAnybody can bring up a database server,\nbut the more that database begins to grow,\n\n53\n00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,880\nthe slower and\nslower the system is going to become.\n\n54\n00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,670\nAnd everybody's data is\na little bit different.\n\n55\n00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,540\nSo we take a look at some of the tools and\n\n56\n00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,540\ntechniques that are available\nto tweak that data,\n\n57\n00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,510\nto change the way that SQL Server\nperforms and get it running a lot faster.\n\n58\n00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,600\nAnd I've got some stories\nI'll tell in those episodes.\n\n59\n00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,540\nYou can really make a big difference\nwith just a few mouse clicks, so\n\n60\n00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,400\nit's some really neat\nstuff that's in there.\n\n61\n00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,020\nOnce the server's up and\nrunning, we're done right?\n\n62\n00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,030\nWe get to walk away?\n\n63\n00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,510\nWell, not quite.\n\n64\n00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,340\nA lot of times we need\nto manage the data and\n\n65\n00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,240\nthat's what the next section jumps into.\n\n66\n00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,125\nEspecially from the standpoint\nof backup and restore, right?\n\n67\n00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:22,110\nIt's very, very easy to accidentally wipe\nall of the data out of a database, right?\n\n68\n00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,198\nIf you give somebody the access\nto write to the database they\n\n69\n00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:25,600\ncouldn't really do that.\n\n70\n00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,950\nSo we need to make sure that we've\ngot backups, reliable backups, right?\n\n71\n00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,740\nIt's easy for us to restore and\nget our systems backup and going.\n\n72\n00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,930\nAnd then this little section right here\nis probably the most important one in\n\n73\n00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,740\nthe entire exam objective set.\n\n74\n00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,910\nManaging or implementing and\nmaintaining indexes, all right?\n\n75\n00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,400\nIndexes will change the performance\nprofile of your server.\n\n76\n00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,860\nThey will make your server\nconsiderably faster.\n\n77\n00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,941\nBut, indexes are completely built around\nthe types of queries people are running.\n\n78\n00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:57,402\nSo we have to understand\nthe queries people are running, and\n\n79\n00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:59,050\nthen build the indexes appropriately.\n\n80\n00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,790\nThere is no one-size-fits-all\nindex solution out there.\n\n81\n00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,820\nSo we'll take a look at how to analyze\nyour database, see how it's being used,\n\n82\n00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,370\nand build the appropriate index\nsystem to make it run faster.\n\n83\n00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,830\nAfter that, we've got security, right?\n\n84\n00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,600\nWe don't wanna forget about that.\n\n85\n00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,810\nSome of the biggest visibility attacks\nthat have happened in the last ten\n\n86\n00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,420\nyears have all been focused on SQL.\n\n87\n00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,830\nWell, I shouldn't say it that way, right?\n\n88\n00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,640\nWhen we say SQL, that means Microsoft SQL.\n\n89\n00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,870\nWhen we say S-Q-L, well that's the\nstandard query language that's used across\n\n90\n00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,304\nnumerous products like Oracle,\nMySQL, and so on.\n\n91\n00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:35,960\nAnd, SQL injection attacks\n\n92\n00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,870\nare some of the biggest ones that have\nhappened over the last ten years.\n\n93\n00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,832\nMany of which went against\nMicrosoft servers, but\n\n94\n00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:43,570\nmany of which went against the Oracle and\nthe other guys too.\n\n95\n00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,240\nSo, how do we secure our system to\nhelp prevent from things like that?\n\n96\n00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,863\nWell, a lot of that is prevented\non the developer's side,\n\n97\n00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:51,234\nthey can take care of it there.\n\n98\n00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:54,475\nBut there are things we can do on\nthe back end with databases permissions,\n\n99\n00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:55,321\nlog ins and roles.\n\n100\n00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:59,902\nAnd other things to eliminate that\naccidental activity where people start to\n\n101\n00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:03,931\ninject commands and to do things\nthat we don't want to have happen.\n\n102\n00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:04,840\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n103\n00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,620\nthen the last part of the exam objectives\nis implementing high availability.\n\n104\n00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,110\nWe talk about it a little bit in\nthe maintaining databases section.\n\n105\n00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,966\nBut then we get into it down here\nas far as setting up a mirror,\n\n106\n00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:20,120\ngetting Always On configured, setting up\nfailover, and getting that put into place.\n\n107\n00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,870\nSo really good stuff to\nkeep the system online.\n\n108\n00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,620\nThese are the tasks right here\nthat an average system admin that\n\n109\n00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,280\nsupports a network that involves SQL\nservers are going to be expected to know.\n\n110\n00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,180\nSo it's a great set of knowledge.\n\n111\n00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,380\nFor a Microsoft exam this is one of\nthe few ones where I look at it and\n\n112\n00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,467\nI'm like man,\nthis is all stuff will actually use.\n\n113\n00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:43,040\nA lot of times there's at least one\nmodule in there where they put some fluff\n\n114\n00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,400\ncloud service or whatever,\nthat's more of a marketing module.\n\n115\n00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,118\nBut in this one, it's really\nskills that you'll use, all right.\n\n116\n00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:53,580\nNow, if you're looking to go a little\nmore onto the development side,\n\n117\n00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,613\nif you're looking to write SQL queries.\n\n118\n00:05:55,613 --> 00:06:00,074\nIf you wanna learn how to create\ntables and set up foreign keys and\n\n119\n00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:05,385\nrelationships like that, well,\nthe 70-462 doesn't do it.\n\n120\n00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:06,505\nBut if you're looking to work for\n\n121\n00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:10,675\nyour MCSA SQL Server,\nthere's other exams involved.\n\n122\n00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:14,840\nThe 462 is just one of them,\nthat's the one that really is designed for\n\n123\n00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,811\nsystem administrators.\n\n124\n00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:21,171\nBut notice there's the 461, Querying\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2012, all right.\n\n125\n00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:23,380\nThat is writing query statements.\n\n126\n00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,680\nYou actually start to learn\nthe standard query language,\n\n127\n00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,160\nhow to interact with\nthe data on the server.\n\n128\n00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,590\nHow to put data in the database,\nhow to get data out of the database.\n\n129\n00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,921\nA regular system admin doesn't really\nneed to know how to do that, but\n\n130\n00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:38,560\nsomebody who's actually DBA,\nDatabase Administrator, would.\n\n131\n00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,310\nAnd then, implementing a data warehouse\nwith Microsoft SQL Server 2012.\n\n132\n00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,540\nThat's where you start learning\nabout how to design your tables,\n\n133\n00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,590\nhow to work with the data\ninside of the database,\n\n134\n00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,590\nhow to create views and reports,\nhow to deal with integration services.\n\n135\n00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,020\nAll these extra things that a normal\nsystem admin is not going to work with,\n\n136\n00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,830\nbut instead, a DBA would, all right.\n\n137\n00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,490\nSo the full certification, the MCSA\nSQL Server, is really designed for\n\n138\n00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,800\nsomebody who's operating in that DBA role,\nwho is a database administrator.\n\n139\n00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,750\nBut this one that we're doing right here,\n70-462, works really for\n\n140\n00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,375\nanybody who has the responsibility\nof supporting a server running SQL.\n\n141\n00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:23,850\nSo I think this is one of the greater\nexams, one of the greatest set of topics.\n\n142\n00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,490\nEven if you don't take the exam,\n\n143\n00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,310\nthe stuff we talk about on\nthis show is really useful.\n\n144\n00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,690\nIt will help you operate\nyour database environment.\n\n145\n00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,190\nAnd those databases, for a lot of people,\nif you have a database server,\n\n146\n00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,710\nit's usually the core of your business,\nand so losing that, right, is a big deal.\n\n147\n00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,460\nIt could take your business offline for\nhours,\n\n148\n00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,390\ndays, who knows how long to\nget a system back online.\n\n149\n00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,570\nSo having it set up right\nfrom the beginning and\n\n150\n00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,130\nhaving a good backup strategy are two key\npieces we wanna make sure we have covered.\n\n151\n00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,530\nAll right, now our show content\nwill match up with the 70-462 exam,\n\n152\n00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,680\nso we're gonna cover all the stuff\nthat's on there like we normally do,\n\n153\n00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,584\nyou'll be prepared for that.\n\n154\n00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,670\nIf you wanna go on to do the other ones,\n\n155\n00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,660\nwe don't have plans in our schedule\nright now to tackle those.\n\n156\n00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,000\nBut things change over time, so\nby the time you're watching this, well,\n\n157\n00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,740\nnot if you're watching it live I guess,\nbut\n\n158\n00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,170\nif you're watching this down the road, we\nmay have already recorded the other ones.\n\n159\n00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,424\nSo check out the library and\nsee if they're there.\n\n160\n00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:26,650\nAll right, well that's pretty\nmuch my overview of this one.\n\n161\n00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,525\nI'll see you in the show.\n\n162\n00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:28,444\n[SOUND]\n\n",
