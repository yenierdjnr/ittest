          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.874\n[SOUND] In this segment,\nwe're gonna give you\n\n2\n00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:09.596\na general overview on\nour upcoming series on\n\n3\n00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:14.586\nquerying the Microsoft SQL server 2014.\n\n4\n00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:18.534\nAnd Ronnie I'm glad you're here with me\ntoday because I was hoping you could give\n\n5\n00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:22.193\nus a very good overview, at least\na general expectation of what we should,\n\n6\n00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:24.130\nwell expect, on the upcoming series.\n\n7\n00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.000\n>> Sure that'd be a great way for\n\n8\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.120\nus to get started when we start\nin on Microsoft SQL server 2014.\n\n9\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.090\nNow let's go ahead and take a look at\nthe official exam objectives here.\n\n10\n00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.480\nAnd that way that will help us to get\nsituated in the mindset that we need.\n\n11\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.550\nSo on my screen I went ahead and pulled\nup the official exam objective page.\n\n12\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.640\nNow you're going to notice something.\n\n13\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.040\nEven though we centered\nin on SQL server 2014,\n\n14\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.410\nwe use that as the environment for\neverything that we did in our show.\n\n15\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.960\nYou'll notice it's actually for querying,\nwell both SQL Server 2012 and 2014,\n\n16\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.580\nthe entire exam actually\ncenters around both of them.\n\n17\n00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.330\nBut the great thing is everything that\nwe've actually done in the show should\n\n18\n00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.170\nwork for both products.\n\n19\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.644\nSo that's why we're not so\nmuch worried about going between 2012 and\n\n20\n00:01:05.644 --> 00:01:09.700\n2014 SQL server right\nat the beginning here.\n\n21\n00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.280\nNow when it comes down to what we end up\ncovering in the exam objectives itself,\n\n22\n00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.420\nwe take the official exam objectives and\nwhat we're going to do of course\n\n23\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.150\nis we're going to essentially cover all\nthe elements in those exam objectives.\n\n24\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.720\nSo where we're gonna begin\nis taking a look of course\n\n25\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.220\nat the database objects as well.\n\n26\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.710\nSo we are going to make sure that we\nunderstand how of course to create and\n\n27\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.650\nalter tables and that's of course\nusing SQL querying to help us\n\n28\n00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.700\nto understand those elements that we need\nand the syntax that we need to do that.\n\n29\n00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.170\nAs well as create the idea of\nviews which is a very powerful way\n\n30\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.920\nthat we can get the information\nthat we need and\n\n31\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.370\nactually limit that particular exposure\nto the entire database as well.\n\n32\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.650\nWe'll talk about of course\nthe idea of designing the views.\n\n33\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.120\nAnd then table constraints as well as some\nof the triggers that we can use to help us\n\n34\n00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.860\nto ensure that if we do one thing, we can\nalso trigger another process, as well.\n\n35\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.700\nNow, we also want to actually took\na look there because that's about\n\n36\n00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.650\na quarter of the exam\nis working with data.\n\n37\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.010\nAnd this is the main process that we\nactually spend a little bit more time on.\n\n38\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.320\nThis takes up almost a full\nthird of the exam itself.\n\n39\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.170\nWhere we begin with\nsimple select statements.\n\n40\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.594\nAnd we'll actually see that quite often\nas we actually go in there that more than\n\n41\n00:02:23.594 --> 00:02:28.018\nlikely select statements are where we'll\nfocus in so we do a lot of examples from\n\n42\n00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:32.010\nthis idea and show you some of\nthe different ways we can do it.\n\n43\n00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.660\nIncluding of course\nbuilding sub queries and\n\n44\n00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.380\nworking with data types\nas well as aggregates.\n\n45\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.930\nAnd then we do a little bit\nof a brief example here\n\n46\n00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.560\nin terms of xml querying as well.\n\n47\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.580\nOkay and then we go into modifying our\ndata and this is where we get into\n\n48\n00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.740\na little bit more advanced things that we\ncan do inside of querying our SQL server.\n\n49\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.520\nWhen we start to create and of course\neven alter the idea of stored procedures.\n\n50\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.330\nWhich allows us, once again,\nto be able to limit the access that\n\n51\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.250\nother people can have to our\ndatabase if we choose to.\n\n52\n00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.120\nAnd to make sure that the complex logic\nbehind some of the things that we have to\n\n53\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.120\ndo, is not gonna ever have to be exposed\nto a course our customers as well.\n\n54\n00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.250\nBeing able to build other objects inside\nusing Insert, Delete, and Update, as\n\n55\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.540\nwell as combining data sets together, and\nof course, basic working with functions.\n\n56\n00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.900\nOur last little section is going\nto be on optimizing our queries,\n\n57\n00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.780\ntalking about how transactions\nare managed here.\n\n58\n00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.040\nAs well as of course\nthe idea of error handling.\n\n59\n00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.860\nAnd then noticing the differences\nbetween row based operations and\n\n60\n00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.490\nof course set based operations too.\n\n61\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.260\nNow all those elements, every single\nepisode that we actually are going to do\n\n62\n00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.550\nYou're gonna see that it's gonna\nbe jam packed with examples and\n\n63\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.840\nof course actually work\ninside of the query analyzer.\n\n64\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.410\nNow, the reason why I want to point that\nout is because it does require you then as\n\n65\n00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.510\nyou are preparing for it not just enough\nthat you can watch the episodes here.\n\n66\n00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.310\nBut you do need to get your hands\nin working inside the SQL and\n\n67\n00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.830\nactually doing the querying\nthat you need to do.\n\n68\n00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.310\nAnd that's actually very important.\n\n69\n00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.450\nThe reason why is that you're\ngonna see that a lot of times,\n\n70\n00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.190\nespecially when you're getting ready for\nthe exam that's all about\n\n71\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.420\ncomparing what queries actually\ndo work and what they don't.\n\n72\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.287\nSo understanding the syntax,\ngetting the muscle memory that you need to\n\n73\n00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:25.559\ninvolved is actually gonna\nbe very important for\n\n74\n00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:29.170\njust about everything that we do for\nthe exam as well.\n\n75\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.231\nNow I do want us to make sure that we\nunderstand there is a couple of things we\n\n76\n00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:37.816\nwould consider prerequisites, when getting\nready for the exam, and so lets go and\n\n77\n00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:40.987\ntake a look at my page again and\nthis should help us out to.\n\n78\n00:04:40.987 --> 00:04:46.770\nOkay, so notice that it even says who\nshould actually take this exam here?\n\n79\n00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.750\nIt says this exam is intended for\nSQL Server database administrators,\n\n80\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.780\nsystem engineers, and developers.\n\n81\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.020\nAnd the key is right here at the end,\ntwo or more years of experience\n\n82\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.670\nwho are seeking to validate their\nknowledge in of course in writing queries.\n\n83\n00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.620\nNow this is actually very important.\n\n84\n00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.530\nIt doesn't mean that you cannot\ntake the exam any time you want to.\n\n85\n00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.430\nRegardless of whether or\nnot you have the SQL experience or\n\n86\n00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.280\nnot but\nwhat it does mean is if you don't you're\n\n87\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.020\ngoing to be very confused by some of\nthe things that they're going to show you.\n\n88\n00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.290\nThey're gonna implement of course\ndifferent scenarios that you might not be\n\n89\n00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.180\nfamiliar with if you're not working\nwith SQL pretty much on a daily basis.\n\n90\n00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.250\nSo do not expect as a beginner\nhere if you're just learning SQL\n\n91\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.910\nthat this is the exam for you right away.\n\n92\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.820\nYou may wanna make sure that you ahead and\nhave the foundational concepts down and\n\n93\n00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.470\nthat you feel very comfortable in\nwriting at least basic SQL statements\n\n94\n00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.410\nbefore you start actually on this as\na track that you may wish to follow.\n\n95\n00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.430\nSo it's very important that we do\nthat because a lot of times maybe\n\n96\n00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.540\nyou have this expectation that this\nis a very much a fundamental exam.\n\n97\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.270\nThat you can jump right into it but you\ngonna see challenges here that you may not\n\n98\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.420\nexpect to see and you do not work\nin SQL just about on a daily basis.\n\n99\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.045\nNow overall though for the exam itself the\nprice in US dollars is about $150 here.\n\n100\n00:06:10.045 --> 00:06:12.950\nSo it does require you\nto pay that exam fee.\n\n101\n00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.500\nSo you go to your\nPearson Vue testing center.\n\n102\n00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.700\nAnd don't forget,\nyou do actually have to sign up for this.\n\n103\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.290\nYou can go online to make sure\nyou have your account, and\n\n104\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.560\nthat you pay the fee, and register\nto the nearest Pearson Vue center,\n\n105\n00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.740\nwhere you'll schedule a date and then you\nwill go in and take that exam as well.\n\n106\n00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.430\nSo, this particular exam even\nthough it may cover both of them\n\n107\n00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.200\neverything that we'll cover\nessentially works on both.\n\n108\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.110\nAnd the other thing, if you are really\nconcerned about the idea that hey,\n\n109\n00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.090\n2012 is different from 2014,\n\n110\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.550\nyou'll see that Microsoft itself,\nin December 2015 here, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.490\nEvaluated that the exam didn't\nneed to be updated between both.\n\n112\n00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.570\nSo in other words, whatever you\nactually learned on SQL Server 2012,\n\n113\n00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.980\nif you've already been studying for\nthat you can jump right into this and\n\n114\n00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.760\nthis should also to continue\nto help you out as well.\n\n115\n00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.840\nSo there's some details in it, but\n\n116\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.730\nyou actually see that\nwe'll cover a lot of them.\n\n117\n00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.760\nAnd we actually make sure that we use\na bunch of examples as well to ensure that\n\n118\n00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.990\nyou actually have the most visuals that\nyou can and you'll actually be typing\n\n119\n00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.340\nin SQL, just about, I want to say at least\n50% of the content that we end up actually\n\n120\n00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.650\ncovering will end up being straight\nexamples that we end up using.\n\n121\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.960\nSo just make sure that you take the time,\ngo through that.\n\n122\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.430\nAnd make sure you study\non your own as well.\n\n123\n00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.780\nAnd that's really going to help you.\n\n124\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.330\nIf you're working towards\nyour SQL server MCSA.\n\n125\n00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.870\n>> All right, Ronnie well thank you so\nmuch for that overview, it was great.\n\n126\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.750\nAnd hopefully if that's something that\nsounds like that you might be interested\n\n127\n00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.687\nin or that you need to prepare for to get\nthat actual exam certification underneath\n\n128\n00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:50.960\nyour belt, we look forward to seeing\nyou in the upcoming episodes.\n\n129\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:58.391\n[SOUND]\n\n",
