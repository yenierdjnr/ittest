I'm doing fantastic, Peter.\n\n9\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.060\nVery excited to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.310\nVery excited to talk about,\nsome of the content in my book.\n\n11\n00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140\nSo today we're gonna talk a lot about\nunderstanding the millennial mindset and\n\n12\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.800\ntrying to understand, what is it that\nshaped millennial in the workforce today?\n\n13\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.510\nLike, their certain like experiences that\nthey went through as they were growing up,\n\n14\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.180\nas they were going through their younger\nyears, their adolescent year that really\n\n15\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.270\nshaped the way that this generation really\nthinks and acts and makes decisions.\n\n16\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.280\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, so for this episode,\nwhere are we starting?\n\n17\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.310\n&gt;&gt; So\nlet's start on participation was enough.\n\n18\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.750\nSo this is a topic\nthat's very relevant and\n\n19\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.320\nI know some of us have heard about this\nand this concept, and some of us have\n\n20\n00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.280\ntalked a little bit about it with some\nof our peers but let's jump right into\n\n21\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.410\nwhy this was important and why millennials\nthink that participation is enough.\n\n22\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.260\nSo as adolescents and as teenagers and\nas kids millenials were growing up in\n\n23\n00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.790\na time where their parents were watching\nthe media and the parents were watching\n\n24\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.410\nthe news and everywhere they looked there\nwas this concept coming up all over\n\n25\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.100\nthe place of protecting\na child's self-esteem.\n\n26\n00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.170\nAnd a child's self-esteem was the most\nimportant thing to these parents.\n\n27\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.290\nBecause the media kept telling and\npushing down our throats,\n\n28\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.900\nthat a child's self-esteem,\nif it was hurt at a young age,\n\n29\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.600\nthen it led to higher chances of suicide\nwhen the children became adults.\n\n30\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.590\nAnd this concept really drove home\nthrough millennials' parents.\n\n31\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.180\nSo parents became a little freaked\nout about this and they're like well,\n\n32\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.130\nI don't want that to happen to my child, I\nmean no parent wants to think about that.\n\n33\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.340\nWhen the media was pushing this\ndown the parent's throats,\n\n34\n00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.260\nwhat would happen is self esteem\nbecame a very important concept and\n\n35\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.560\nprotecting a child's self\nesteem was very important.\n\n36\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.326\nSo going forward what would happen is the\nparents of the millennials would go right\n\n37\n00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:04.882\ninto the millennials' personal lives, so\n\n38\n00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:08.335\nin school, in their offside\nactivities like sport teams,\n\n39\n00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:13.447\nif they joined any particular like extra\ncurricular activity, if they're in ballet,\n\n40\n00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:17.935\nif they did any of those activities\nparents were very much watching over their\n\n41\n00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:22.700\nkids to make sure their self-esteem was\nnot being tarnished, to making sure that\n\n42\n00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.518\nthey were protecting that nobody really\nimposed on this child's self-esteem.\n\n43\n00:02:27.518 --> 00:02:31.128\nNow what happened was that that put\na lot of pressure on the teachers,\n\n44\n00:02:31.128 --> 00:02:34.500\nthat put a lot of pressure on\ncoaches of teams, on instructors.\n\n45\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.365\nAnd so much pressure came from\nthe parents to the coaches that this\n\n46\n00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:44.229\nled to the coaches having to\nrecognize all the children equally so\n\n47\n00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:50.066\nthat one child didn't feel left out or\none child didn't feel less important,\n\n48\n00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:54.850\nless valuable, or\nless talented than the other children.\n\n49\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know I played popcorn or\nfootball growing up and I remember you had\n\n50\n00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.470\nthe rule where each player had to get\nin for a certain number of plays.\n\n51\n00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.200\nAnd it kind of felt odd almost those\nplayers that only got in for two or\n\n52\n00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.790\nthree plays.\n\n53\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.090\nYou said well they're only putting them\nin because they have to not because they\n\n54\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.930\nearned that spot.\n\n55\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.560\nKinda causes some conflict on the team.\n\n56\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.390\nSo that kinda has some adverse\nconsequences for the kids.\n\n57\n00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n58\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.860\nin theory this concept with the parents,\nit sounded like it made sense.\n\n59\n00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.990\nAnd it said, well,\nwe wanna protect our children and\n\n60\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.990\nwe wanna make sure that\nthey're treated fairly.\n\n61\n00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.870\nBut the downside of that, which we\ndidn't really see it at the time, but\n\n62\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.890\nwe're starting to see it today as these\nmillennials now come into the workforce,\n\n63\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.900\nas now they're put into real life.\n\n64\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.730\nWhat happened was that these\nparents deprived their children\n\n65\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.870\nof a very important life lesson.\n\n66\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.140\nThese parents took away this opportunity\nfor children to learn that in life,\n\n67\n00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.820\nif you want to win,\nyou need to outwork the loser.\n\n68\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.660\nYou need to put in more effort\nif you want to be the best.\n\n69\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.500\nIf you wanna be recognized, you need\nto work harder than your counterparts.\n\n70\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.776\nAnd unfortunately the millennials\nnever learned that lesson.\n\n71\n00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:06.900\nMillennials were taught, well if I show\nup, I'm gonna get an opportunity to play\n\n72\n00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.870\nlike you just mentioned and at the end of\nthe season everybody's gonna get a trophy.\n\n73\n00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.050\nCoaches were put in a very difficult\nposition where coaches had to see\n\n74\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.640\nhow can I recognize each child?\n\n75\n00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.570\nWhat am I gonna recognize this child for?\n\n76\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.530\nAnd that's were you got most improved\nplayer, we got best effort, right?\n\n77\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.410\nIt wasn't just the MVP that got a trophy.\n\n78\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.170\nIt wasn't just the person\nwho outperformed.\n\n79\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.850\nAnd the first thing that happened was\nwe taught these millennials that,\n\n80\n00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.400\nyou just show up and you're gonna get\nrecognized just like everybody else.\n\n81\n00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.280\nThe second thing that happened,\n\n82\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.120\nwas that we were teaching\nthe hard working students.\n\n83\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.550\nWe were teaching the actual students and\nkids that were outperforming.\n\n84\n00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.790\nWe were teaching them that that\nwasn't necessarily very valuable,\n\n85\n00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.110\nbecause even though you worked hard and\nyou put in more effort, guess what?\n\n86\n00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.220\nEverybody else will also get\nrecognized just like you.\n\n87\n00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.870\nMaybe you might get a bigger trophy, but\n\n88\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.460\nmost of the time,\neverybody have the same size trophy.\n\n89\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.900\nOne would still say MVP.\n\n90\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.330\nBut the guy that got most improved,\nit was the same exact trophy.\n\n91\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.450\nBecause the parents were putting so\nmuch pressure on these coaches, right?\n\n92\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.460\nAnd you could just imagine\nthe coach's position and\n\n93\n00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.645\nthe teacher's position, right?\n\n94\n00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:19.395\nThey were put in a very ugly and\nnasty place we're they could\n\n95\n00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:23.885\nnot recognize a stellar performer because\nthe pressure came from the parents.\n\n96\n00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:26.555\nDon't hurt my child's self\nesteem even though he hasn't\n\n97\n00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:28.585\nput in the extra effort to be the best.\n\n98\n00:05:28.585 --> 00:05:33.300\n&gt;&gt; Sure so, what impact does that have\non those kids that grew up and now today\n\n99\n00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.280\nare in the workforce, are they coming\nto work with those same expectations?\n\n100\n00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.660\nIs that something that as an employer or\n\n101\n00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.715\nas a co-worker you want to help try to\nbreak that or work with them on that.\n\n102\n00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:48.085\nWhere do we do from there?\n\n103\n00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:51.575\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what's happening is,\nas employers, first thing we need to\n\n104\n00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:56.285\nunderstand is that when we start\nlabeling millennials as entitled.\n\n105\n00:05:56.285 --> 00:05:57.762\nRight, this word Word\nis tossed around a lot.\n\n106\n00:05:57.762 --> 00:06:00.062\nA millennial shows up to work and\nall of a sudden they're entitled.\n\n107\n00:06:00.062 --> 00:06:03.422\nThey think they're deserving of\npromotions, of higher salaries, or\n\n108\n00:06:03.422 --> 00:06:06.892\nthey're deserving of corner offices.\n\n109\n00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:10.782\nAnd we have to understand, to a certain\nextent, this is no fault of their own.\n\n110\n00:06:10.782 --> 00:06:12.932\nThis is just the hand they were dealt.\n\n111\n00:06:12.932 --> 00:06:14.612\nThis is the world they were brought up in.\n\n112\n00:06:14.612 --> 00:06:18.630\nThis is the world that their\nparents actually were the ones that\n\n113\n00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.020\nraised them in this manner.\n\n114\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.920\nBecause that's what was\ngoing on at the time.\n\n115\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.310\nSo, as employers, the first thing we\nneed to do is start to recognize and\n\n116\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.790\nbe a little more patient.\n\n117\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.880\nWe've got to understand and\nexplain to them and\n\n118\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.260\ncreate the culture in our\norganizations that they can fit into.\n\n119\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.960\nThat will actually help them understand\nthat if you want to be recognized,\n\n120\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.770\nyou need to outwork your counterparts,\nright?\n\n121\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.870\nSo what do we do as employers\nto really create that culture?\n\n122\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.370\nNumber one that I always recommend to\nall of the entrepreneurs I talk to and\n\n123\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.800\nall the managers and CEOs of companies,\n\n124\n00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.470\nis create a very clear\nscoreboard in your company.\n\n125\n00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.380\nSo teach your team very\nclearly what it is to win.\n\n126\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.830\nRight, define winning.\n\n127\n00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.610\nDon't just say, okay well great, we had\na great year this year and sales were up.\n\n128\n00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.150\nBut that's not really relevant,\nwe need to be very specific.\n\n129\n00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.830\nAnd we want to get a scoreboard for\nevery single position in the company,\n\n130\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.100\nevery single department, and find a way to\nmeasure what the production looks like.\n\n131\n00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.190\nFind a way to measure\nwhat winning looks like.\n\n132\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.230\nSometimes it could be\ncustomer service scores.\n\n133\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.390\nSometimes it could be number\nof leaves that came in.\n\n134\n00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.550\nSometimes it could be maybe\nour marketing department is\n\n135\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.460\nmeasuring the social media traffic.\n\n136\n00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.930\nMaybe it could be number of episodes\nrecorded, I mean there could be\n\n137\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.300\na number of things that really\naffect what that person is doing and\n\n138\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.040\nif you have a very clear scoreboard,\nwhen a millennial comes on board,\n\n139\n00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.080\nthe millennial will learn and say okay, I\nwant to be at the top of that scoreboard.\n\n140\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.620\nAnd when my name is constantly\nshowing up at the bottom or\n\n141\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.570\nat the middle of the scoreboard,\nI understand and\n\n142\n00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.430\nI know what activities I need to\nengage in to therefore become better.\n\n143\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.890\n&gt;&gt; And that sounds like maybe giving\nsome clear expectations of not just hey,\n\n144\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.420\nwe want you here on the top, but\nwhen you are on the bottom here\n\n145\n00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.440\nare some things you can do\nto work your way back up so\n\n146\n00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.780\nwe know what's expected of you and\nhelp them achieve those goals.\n\n147\n00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n148\n00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:07.040\nI mean that couldn't be exactly\nbetter said because most of the time,\n\n149\n00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.200\nthe organizations that I work with,\nthe companies that I talk to,\n\n150\n00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.380\nthe entrepreneurs,\n\n151\n00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.180\nwe have a definition in our mind of\nwhat success looks like for our company.\n\n152\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.380\nWe know,\nwe have a very clear vision in our head\n\n153\n00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.120\nof what we want\nthe organization to accomplish.\n\n154\n00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.140\nWhere most entrepreneurs, managers and\norganizational leaders fail\n\n155\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:30.540\nis clearly articulating that vision and\nthat definition of success to our team.\n\n156\n00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.210\nIf we don't pull that information out of\nour head and give it out to our team,\n\n157\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.760\neither through a painted picture of where\nwe're trying to go, scoreboards, KPIs,\n\n158\n00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.200\ndashboards, these kind of tools need to\nbe put into your organization to clearly\n\n159\n00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.130\narticulate to your team what success\nlooks like, what does winning look like?\n\n160\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:48.920\nAnd typically,\n\n161\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.610\nif a company's doing it, they typically\ndo it on a very global scale.\n\n162\n00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.480\nIt's very few companies, and this is only\nthe highest performing companies that I've\n\n163\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.570\nseen that do this well are the ones\nthat break it down to a granular level,\n\n164\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.280\ndown to each different department and\neach different role, right?\n\n165\n00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.720\nAnd that's where we need\nto get really clear.\n\n166\n00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.110\nSo create a dashboard for\nevery single role in your company, so\n\n167\n00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.410\nthat every role knows exactly what\nthe definition of success in that role is.\n\n168\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.420\nAnd as a millennial coming\ninto that type of culture,\n\n169\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.990\ninto that type of organization, they will\nquickly assimilate because they understand\n\n170\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.020\nthis is how I am being measured,\nthis is how I'm being rewarded, and\n\n171\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.630\nthis is what success looks like.\n\n172\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.240\nso when I walk into a company as\na millennial, there's no obscure sense of\n\n173\n00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.510\nwho's winning, who's losing, who's\nputting in the effort, who's out working.\n\n174\n00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.890\nAnd I know that participation\nin this workplace is not enough.\n\n175\n00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.410\nSo if I just showed up to work, that\ndoesn't mean I'm guaranteed my paycheck.\n\n176\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.570\nI need to earn my place to be here and\nif I'm not putting in the work,\n\n177\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.920\nI'm not putting in the effort, one of\nmy counterparts can outperform me, and\n\n178\n00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.460\nI can either possibly lose my job or\nI'm not gonna be entitled to the bonuses,\n\n179\n00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.790\nrewards, or higher commissions.\n\n180\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.560\n&gt;&gt; And that's a great point you just\nbrought up that maybe participation is\n\n181\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.370\nenough to keep your job but if your\ncompensation is tied to that if it's\n\n182\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.080\na sales position and you're on commission\nor there are those bonus programs.\n\n183\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.530\nThat's maybe how we kind of\nget that message across that\n\n184\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.890\nparticipation might have been\nenough when you were a kid but\n\n185\n00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.680\nit's not enough here in\nthe workforce today.\n\n186\n00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.560\nBut are there any other topics you'd\nlike to cover in this episode?\n\n187\n00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.090\n&gt;&gt; No, that's pretty much the main gist.\n\n188\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.120\nI just really want to be clear and\nexplain to the entrepreneurs and\n\n189\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.080\nthe leaders and the organizational leaders\nthat just labeling the millennials and\n\n190\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.330\ntelling them, you're entitled.\n\n191\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.580\nAnd I'm not gonna hire a millennial,\nor just letting them go.\n\n192\n00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.630\nWe need to turn around and\nreally start to look in the mirror.\n\n193\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.830\nAnd say,\nwell what are we doing as an organization?\n\n194\n00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.180\nWhat are we doing as a team to really\nalign everybody in our organization,\n\n195\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.490\nand teach our millennials, and everybody\nin the workforce, because right now we're\n\n196\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.830\ntalking specifically about millennials,\nbut there's not one single generational\n\n197\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.160\nperson on your team that will not\nappreciate this kind of clarity.\n\n198\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.740\nThere's not one single person in your\ncompany right now that will not get value\n\n199\n00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.200\nand prove their performance if we can\nbe extremely clear about measurements.\n\n200\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.470\nSo let's not be so\nquick to label them as entitled.\n\n201\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.280\nBut let's take a look in the mirror and\nreally think.\n\n202\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.470\nWhat are we doing and\nhow are we adding to this in our culture?\n\n203\n00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.270\nAre we creating a culture\nby default that things just\n\n204\n00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.150\nhappen because I expect everybody\nto know what success looks like?\n\n205\n00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.750\nOr are we creating a purposeful\nculture that creates and\n\n206\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.630\nempowers our team to be leaders and\nbe winners.\n\n207\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, great Javier,\nthat's a lot of fantastic information.\n\n208\n00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.760\nIt'll help us out, and\nit'll get a lot more information on\n\n209\n00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.680\nworking with millennials and\nunderstanding the nuances of that.\n\n210\n00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.280\nWe're gonna have to save that for\nfuture episodes.\n\n211\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.170\nSo going ahead and signing off,\nI've been your host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n212\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.958\n&gt;&gt;

Now, what does that have\nto do with the workforce?\n\n15\n00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:36.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n16\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.090\nYeah, it's unique to ask me about that.\n\n17\n00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.080\nBut, a lot of people,\nI hear a lot of topics\n\n18\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.030\nabout millennials are always\nwith their headphones on, right?\n\n19\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.160\nYou hear about this a lot, and you watch\nthem a lot, and you're seeing there.\n\n20\n00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.430\nAnd people don't understand, right?\n\n21\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.030\nI think gen xer's and baby boomers\nhave a harder time understanding\n\n22\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.340\nwhy do they have their\nheadphones on all the time?\n\n23\n00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.530\nEverywhere they go, everything they\ndo is always with their headphones.\n\n24\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.940\nSo we're gonna talk about this.\n\n25\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.290\nAnd let's talk about this today and\nhow it affects the workforce.\n\n26\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.630\nSo first thing we're gonna talk about is,\n\n27\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.070\nwhy did millennials learn to have\ntheir headphones on all the time?\n\n28\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.414\nSo we're gonna trace back, again growing\nup as a millenial, millenial's as they're\n\n29\n00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:21.510\nteens and as moving in through adolescent\nyears and getting into college.\n\n30\n00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.280\nDuring this time, and\nagain millenial's are children that\n\n31\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.420\nwere born between the years 1980 and\n2000, and during this time,\n\n32\n00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.290\nwhen they were about their teenage years,\nthis concept of downloading\n\n33\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.490\nmusic from a company called Napster\nbecame popular, this started to happen.\n\n34\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.050\nSo, pre this era, if you wanted to listen\nto music, you bought CD's, you bought\n\n35\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.550\nrecords, and before that you bought 8\ntracks, right, you bought cassette tapes.\n\n36\n00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.820\nAnd that was the way you got music,\nor you listened to the radio.\n\n37\n00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.136\nNow, when you started getting the ability\nto download music from Napster,\n\n38\n00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:58.631\nmusic started to gain a lot of traction,\nand\n\n39\n00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:02.018\nstarted to get very easily\naccessible to the entire world.\n\n40\n00:02:02.018 --> 00:02:08.030\nNow, of course, naturally, technology is\nusually adopted by younger generations,\n\n41\n00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.743\nso millennials were the perfect\npeople to start adopting Napster and\n\n42\n00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:14.218\ndownloading music.\n\n43\n00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:15.696\nNow some of you can remember,\n\n44\n00:02:15.696 --> 00:02:19.247\nI can remember when you first started\ndownloading music from Napster,\n\n45\n00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:23.630\nit took about an hour or so to download\na song from Napster, it took a while.\n\n46\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.870\nWe would put them on cues sometimes and\ndepending, then DSL started coming out and\n\n47\n00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.260\nwe started getting songs-\n&gt;&gt; I'd leave it overnight I remember.\n\n48\n00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.030\nI'd put a whole CD that I wanted and come\nback in the morning and we're 90% done.\n\n49\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.970\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah, that was the world.\n\n50\n00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.640\nBut for us, that was very fast.\n\n51\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.690\nThat was almost instant, right,\nbecause other than that,\n\n52\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.860\nbefore we had mail-order CDs,\nwe had mail-order cassettes.\n\n53\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.580\nSometimes we would go to a record store or\na cassette store and buy something.\n\n54\n00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.830\nBut typically we bought\nstuff through mail-order so\n\n55\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.460\nthis was an instant way of getting the\ncontent, which in this case was the music.\n\n56\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.730\nSo this started to become very popular,\nand in a very short time\n\n57\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.470\nthe Internet speed started to get a little\nbit quicker and a little bit quicker.\n\n58\n00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.780\nAnd music became so much more readily\navailable to the mass population.\n\n59\n00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.010\nMusic gained a lot of traction.\n\n60\n00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.790\nSo since this became so\n\n61\n00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.620\neasily accessible, right after this came\nout the concept of portable MP3 players.\n\n62\n00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.650\nAnd now everybody kind of uses iPods,\n\n63\n00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.510\nbut before they were called\nportable MP3 players.\n\n64\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.310\nAnd people would be able to grab the music\nand download it from Napster, and\n\n65\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.750\nbe able to put it on your\nportable MP3 player, and\n\n66\n00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.300\nyou would have the music available to you,\nwith you, wherever you went.\n\n67\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.130\nSo right before millennials, that\nWalkman concept was pretty popular and\n\n68\n00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.630\nthat started to gain attraction, but\nagain, you had to have your cassette,\n\n69\n00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.370\nyou had to have your CD, you had to have\nit with you to be able to listen to it.\n\n70\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.950\n&gt;&gt; And\nas someone that had both the Walkman and\n\n71\n00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.470\nthe Discman I can say you can't go out and\n\n72\n00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.170\ngo running with the Discman without\nit skipping the whole time.\n\n73\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.320\nSo I remember the first MP3 player I had\nand it just made it so much easier to just\n\n74\n00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.640\nstick it in your pocket on the train,\non the plane, just walking to work.\n\n75\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's exactly what happened.\n\n76\n00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.580\nIt became so easy to have this.\n\n77\n00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.000\nAnd it became so accessable.\n\n78\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.760\nAnd it became so useful.\n\n79\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.160\nEven though the iPods were\nkinda pretty big at the time,\n\n80\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.920\nthey were still a little big and\nbulky, but that was so much smaller.\n\n81\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.810\n&gt;&gt; Smaller than the Discman.\n\n82\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.140\n&gt;&gt; Than the Discman right,\nand it wouldn't skip.\n\n83\n00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.295\nAnd you could have much more music and\nmuch more variety,\n\n84\n00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:23.301\nbecause if you had a Discman you were\nlimited to what was on that CD right,\n\n85\n00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:26.475\none artist, one group,\none particular genre of music.\n\n86\n00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:30.071\nWith the new iPods or\nthe portable MP3 players, you were able to\n\n87\n00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:34.481\ngrab this music in all kinds of varieties,\nand only pick the songs you wanted.\n\n88\n00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:37.533\nBecause it started to get so\npopular so quickly,\n\n89\n00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:41.106\nmillennials began to use these gizmos,\nthese gadgets,\n\n90\n00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:46.033\nalmost on a day-in, day-out basis,\nthey started using these all the time.\n\n91\n00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:48.893\nSo as the millennials are going\nthrough their adolescent years,\n\n92\n00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:50.924\nwhich are learning years for\nmost teenagers.\n\n93\n00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:53.228\nAnd they may be breaking\nup with girlfriends,\n\n94\n00:04:53.228 --> 00:04:56.192\nnow all of a sudden trying to\nget acceptance in high school.\n\n95\n00:04:56.192 --> 00:05:01.376\nAnd they're going to college and\nthey start dating, these are very trivial\n\n96\n00:05:01.376 --> 00:05:06.398\nyears, so, as they started listening\nto this music more and more often,\n\n97\n00:05:06.398 --> 00:05:12.020\nthey found music as kind of like a sense\nof peace, and a sense of connection.\n\n98\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.640\nSo, during these trivial years when they,\nsometimes they may have felt depression.\n\n99\n00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.050\nThey may have like they\ndidn't have friends.\n\n100\n00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.120\nThey may have felt like they\nwere all of a sudden in love.\n\n101\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.450\nMusic started getting a very deep\nconnection with some of these emotions\n\n102\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.390\nwith millennials.\n\n103\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.520\nSo music became a part of\ntheir life that was very,\n\n104\n00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.790\nvery much tied to their emotional side.\n\n105\n00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.150\nNow millennials continue this,\nbecause as the trend came and\n\n106\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.870\nas technology came,\nmusic only became more easily accessible,\n\n107\n00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.680\nInternet got faster, and\nwe started to push mainstream,\n\n108\n00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.170\nlike the cool devices were the iPods,\nso now everybody wanted an iPod.\n\n109\n00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.680\nI mean when I was growing up,\neverybody wanted a Walkman, or\n\n110\n00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.690\nmaybe you wanted a yellow Sony one, cuz\nthat was the cool thing with the smaller\n\n111\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.330\near buds, but millennials now, all of\na sudden, wanted iPods, so for Christmas,\n\n112\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.210\nall the Christmas gifts were iPods.\n\n113\n00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.660\nNow this became their way of\nactually finding peace and\n\n114\n00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.750\nconnection, and really finding\na place to relax in a safe place.\n\n115\n00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.130\nMusic became a safe haven for\nmillenials, and this music was very,\n\n116\n00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.440\nwhat's the word,\nvery emotional for millennials.\n\n117\n00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.290\nAs millenials started growing up\nthrough their lives, TV was not so\n\n118\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.150\neasily accessible.\n\n119\n00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So TVs were still tied\n\n120\n00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.570\nto these big things with big tubes.\n\n121\n00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.340\nAnd there was no such\nthing as streaming yet,\n\n122\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.528\nthere was no such thing as online viewing\nTV because the data was too high.\n\n123\n00:06:29.528 --> 00:06:33.390\nAnd there was no such thing as\nbeing able to get stuff on Netflix.\n\n124\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.600\nThere was no such thing\nas DVRs at this time.\n\n125\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.820\nSo TV didn't gain so\nmuch traction with the millennials.\n\n126\n00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.620\n&gt;&gt; And even for these earlier millennials,\nthe one's born closer to 80.\n\n127\n00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.934\nI mean that was a time\nwhere you still had,\n\n128\n00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:45.334\nmaybe one TV in the house\nin the living room.\n\n129\n00:06:45.334 --> 00:06:47.779\nYou didn't have a TV in your room,\na TV in the kitchen,\n\n130\n00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:49.492\n[LAUGH] things like you might have now.\n\n131\n00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.767\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah TV's, they were one\nin a house, they were a commodity,\n\n132\n00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:54.150\nthey were expensive.\n\n133\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.190\nSo TV did not really sit\nwell with this generation.\n\n134\n00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.790\nYeah they liked it a little bit,\nand it was cool to have.\n\n135\n00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.150\nAnd they would watch with their\nfamily every now and then.\n\n136\n00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.980\nBut music, by far overtook a big\npart of a millennials life.\n\n137\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.780\nSo as they're going into the workforce,\nand\n\n138\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.060\nhow does this affect\nthem in the workforce?\n\n139\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.330\nMillennials, now all of the sudden,\nlearned to focus more by hearing music.\n\n140\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.897\nSo when millennials are putting\non their headphones,\n\n141\n00:07:20.897 --> 00:07:24.974\nprevious generations would define this as\ndistracting, previous generations would\n\n142\n00:07:24.974 --> 00:07:29.250\ndefine this as kinda zoning out and\nignoring the workplace that's around you.\n\n143\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.780\nBut this, we need to understand as\nentrepreneurs and as business owners and\n\n144\n00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.090\nas business leaders,\nmillennials find peace, comfort,\n\n145\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.880\nfocus, they get more efficient\nwhen they're listening to music.\n\n146\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.730\n&gt;&gt; That's a really interesting point that\nyou make because I feel, for someone maybe\n\n147\n00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.700\na little bit older, you get their sense\nthat when someone puts on headphones,\n\n148\n00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.240\nthey're saying, I don't wanna talk to you,\nI don't wanna listen to you.\n\n149\n00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.190\nYou get that on an airplane, where the\nperson next to you puts on the headphones.\n\n150\n00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.910\nOkay, obviously, they don't wanna talk.\n\n151\n00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.470\nYou see that in the workforce and\nyou might just assume the same thing, but\n\n152\n00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.220\nwhat you're telling is\nit's just not the case.\n\n153\n00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.020\n&gt;&gt; It's not the case, and\nthat's why we have a disconnect.\n\n154\n00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.050\nThat's really what I'm here to do.\n\n155\n00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.488\nI'm trying to bridge the gap\nbetween the two generations.\n\n156\n00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:10.360\n&gt;&gt; Not understand that one is better or\nworse, but we're just different, and\n\n157\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.812\nif we can understand that when\na millennial puts on their headphones or\n\n158\n00:08:13.812 --> 00:08:18.018\nstarts listening to music, we understand\nthat that's helps them focus better,\n\n159\n00:08:18.018 --> 00:08:21.180\nthat helps them become more efficient,\nmore productive.\n\n160\n00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.980\nIf we can embrace that then,\nwe can really create a culture\n\n161\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.110\nthat will embrace the millenials and\nyou'll get higher productivity.\n\n162\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:34.310\nSee, when, as a Gen Xer,\nmindset that I have, cuz by definition,\n\n163\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.510\nI am a millenial, but Gen Xers,\nbaby boomers, we take that the wrong way.\n\n164\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.730\nWe take that as,\nthey're gonna be distracted.\n\n165\n00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.310\nThey don't wanna do work, they're gonna\nsit there and just entertain themselves\n\n166\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.415\nwith their headphones and not do any work,\nbut it's the exact opposite.\n\n167\n00:08:46.415 --> 00:08:50.000\nSo, our innate natures come in and\nsay no music at work.\n\n168\n00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.300\nNo headphones at work.\n\n169\n00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.700\nYou can't do that.\n\n170\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.680\nYou're telling a millennial, indirectly,\nI'm gonna allow you not to focus here.\n\n171\n00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.820\nI'm going to allow you\nnot to be efficient.\n\n172\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.560\nI want you not to find that comfort here,\n\n173\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.320\nbecause I believe that you can't focus\nif you're listening to that headphone.\n\n174\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.670\nSo, we create a big\ngenerational disconnect.\n\n175\n00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.600\nEventually, that leads to\nthe millennial being unhappy,\n\n176\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.320\nbecause you've created an environment\nwhere they can't find peace.\n\n177\n00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.530\nYou've created an environment\nwhere they can't be happy,\n\n178\n00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.390\nan unsafe environment for them.\n\n179\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.410\nAnd eventually, that will lead to\nthe millennial resigning their position or\n\n180\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.530\nquitting, and then we tend to label\nthem as well, they just quit.\n\n181\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.360\nThey switch jobs too much.\n\n182\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.470\nAgain, we're going back to\nlooking in the mirror and saying,\n\n183\n00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.720\ndo we understand this generation?\n\n184\n00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.280\nAnd are we creating an environment where\nthis generation can actually thrive?\n\n185\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.560\n&gt;&gt; So the first step to embracing\nit is really just allowing it.\n\n186\n00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.350\nBut from there, it sounds like you could\nmaybe form a connection with someone by\n\n187\n00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.220\ntalking about the music.\n\n188\n00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.750\nHey, what are you listening to?\n\n189\n00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.770\nLet me share this album with you or\nthings like that.\n\n190\n00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the most successful\ncompanies that I've seen,\n\n191\n00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.970\nhave really embraced this concept\nof music in the workplace.\n\n192\n00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.028\nAnd they're using it in a very nice way.\n\n193\n00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:59.070\nThey're putting speakers in\nthroughout their office and\n\n194\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.927\nthey're creating playlists that\ntheir entire workforce really enjoy.\n\n195\n00:10:02.927 --> 00:10:07.260\nI think one of the best examples at\none of the companies I've seen is,\n\n196\n00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.912\nthat upon hiring, they ask their\nemployees two of their favorite songs.\n\n197\n00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:16.158\nAnd when that employee comes on board,\nthere is a certain person in the company,\n\n198\n00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:20.280\nmaybe the IT person, their responsibility\nis to make sure that those two songs\n\n199\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.630\nare incorporated in the playlist that\ngoes on in the company at some point.\n\n200\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.410\nSo, before you know it,\n\n201\n00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.240\nyou have this playlist that's going\non throughout your entire work day\n\n202\n00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.245\nthat are your entire\nteam's favorite songs, and\n\n203\n00:10:31.245 --> 00:10:33.920\nat some point in the day,\nthey're gonna hear their favorite song.\n\n204\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.720\nI mean, that's just genius,\nit's wonderful.\n\n205\n00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.640\nYou're creating an environment where\neveryone on your team can actually connect\n\n206\n00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.450\nwith music.\n\n207\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.540\nAgain, music has the power to connect with\npeople in a way that words never will.\n\n208\n00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.220\nBecause all of us can remember music and\nrelate it to an experience,\n\n209\n00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.400\na certain emotion that we had\nat some point in our lives.\n\n210\n00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.590\nMusic again, connects on a different,\n\n211\n00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:59.130\ncompletely deeper level\nthan words ever will.\n\n212\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.470\nEmbracing music into your company culture,\nembracing music will not only again make\n\n213\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:08.760\nyour millennials feel much safer and\nmuch more efficient, but I would\n\n214\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.350\nargue strongly that it would\nembrace your entire team,\n\n215\n00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.060\nno matter what generation they are in,\nbecause they all have memories guaranteed.\n\n216\n00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.480\nIf you're a baby boomer or a Gen Xer you\nremember Woodstock, you remember MTV,\n\n217\n00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.240\nyou had your favorite artist.\n\n218\n00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.830\nYou had all these things and you\nconnected in certain moments in your life\n\n219\n00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.710\nthat you will remember and\nyou attach them to a particular song, and\n\n220\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:34.360\nyou can relive those moments once again,\nand you create a much happier workplace.\n\n221\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.680\n&gt;&gt; It may or may not be a song that\ntakes me back to the fifth grade dance,\n\n222\n00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.425\ndancing with Anna, I'm not gonna\nget into that in this episode.\n\n223\n00:11:40.425 --> 00:11:43.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anything else we wanna talk\n\n224\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.090\nabout as it relates to music?\n\n225\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.930\n&gt;&gt; No, pretty much that's it.\n\n226\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.240\nMusic is just an important part\nof a millennial's life, and\n\n227\n00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.830\nwe need to, again,\nunderstand this generation.\n\n228\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.340\nThere's so much taboo and\nso much questions about it.\n\n229\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.710\nI'm here to clear it up for you,\nand help you understand and\n\n230\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:01.010\nembrace music was such an integral\npart of a millenial's life.\n\n231\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.090\nI doubt that you will ever run\ninto a millenial that will not\n\n232\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.560\ntell you how passionate\nthey are about music.\n\n233\n00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.200\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\nWell,\n\n234\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.370\nI know we've got a lot more information in\nthe book and a lot more information we're\n\n235\n00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.570\ngonna cover here in these episodes, but\nthat's gonna wrap it up for this topic.\n\n236\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.970\nSo, go ahead and signing off.\n\n237\n00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.280\nI've been your host, Peter VanRysdam.\n\n238\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.479\n&gt;&gt;

Peter VanRysdam.\n\n4\n00:00:06.908 --> 00:00:10.531\nAnd today, we're continuing to talk\nabout understanding millennials and\n\n5\n00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:11.500\nworking with them.\n\n6\n00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.900\nAnd here to help us with that, we have\nan expert and the author of the book,\n\n7\n00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.970\nMillennial Workforce, Javier Montes.\n\n8\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.900\nJavier, how are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.771\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, but\nI'm getting better, Peter.\n\n10\n00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:21.920\nIt's a pleasure to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.680\n&gt;&gt; And today,\nwe're talking about instant gratification.\n\n12\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.020\nSo, what does that mean as\nit pertains to millennials?\n\n13\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.550\n&gt;&gt; So, today,\n\n14\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.020\nwe're gonna talk about another concept\nof understanding the millennial mindset.\n\n15\n00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.085\nAnd actually, what shaped millennials and\n\n16\n00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:38.145\ncaused them to think the way\nthat they think today.\n\n17\n00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:39.775\nSo, we're gonna talk about a concept.\n\n18\n00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:43.125\nToday is all about instant gratification.\n\n19\n00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.125\nSo, instant gratification,\nwe hear about this a lot.\n\n20\n00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:49.060\nI think a lot of business people,\nand a lot of people, in general,\n\n21\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.858\nof every generation are saying\nthat millennials are addicted or\n\n22\n00:00:52.858 --> 00:00:55.904\ncrave or\nrequire instant gratification, right?\n\n23\n00:00:55.904 --> 00:00:56.863\nWe hear about this a lot.\n\n24\n00:00:56.863 --> 00:01:00.130\nAnd let's understand if this is true, and\n\n25\n00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.790\nwhy this was actually\nshaped the way it was.\n\n26\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.270\nSo, let's start off with understanding,\nagain, let's go back to the adolescent\n\n27\n00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.820\nyears, the teen years of millennials and\nthe world that they grew up in.\n\n28\n00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.763\nNow, we gotta understand that during\ntheir adolescent years, millennials grew\n\n29\n00:01:16.763 --> 00:01:21.719\nup at a time where their entire world was\nbased on instant gratification, right?\n\n30\n00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.120\nThe last episode we talked about Napster,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.030\nSo, understand that a millennial thinks,\nwell, I wanna have music,\n\n32\n00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.180\nI download it from Napster and\nI get it right now, right?\n\n33\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.585\nThere was no more mail order for them.\n\n34\n00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:37.053\nThere was no more going to the store and\nhaving to wait to buy it or\n\n35\n00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:38.500\nmaybe wait for a release.\n\n36\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.247\nThey went online and they got it, and\nthey got it right then and there.\n\n37\n00:01:40.247 --> 00:01:43.659\nA few years later passed\nby with the millennials and\n\n38\n00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.980\nTV started becoming streamable,\nTV started becoming easily accessible.\n\n39\n00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.751\nSo, we started having devices like a DVR.\n\n40\n00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:56.236\nWe started having devices I think TiVo was\none of the first ones that started coming\n\n41\n00:01:56.236 --> 00:02:01.310\nout where you can record, pause live TV,\nand come back to it whenever you wanted.\n\n42\n00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.180\nThis is crazy,\nthis is a revolutionary concept.\n\n43\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.050\nAnd millennials were growing up in\nthis time and watching these things.\n\n44\n00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.330\nNow, I'm gonna go over to\nprevious generations, so\n\n45\n00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.310\nthat we can kind of understand\nwhat previous generations think.\n\n46\n00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.010\nAnd why they were not raised with\nthis instant gratification mindset.\n\n47\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.080\nSo, previous generations grew up at\na time where they had to wait for\n\n48\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.680\nthings naturally.\n\n49\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.540\nThey grew up in world of mail order,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.110\nSo, it was not uncommon if you\nwanted to order something,\n\n51\n00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.600\nyou prepared envelope, you put a check\nin the envelope, you send it out and\n\n52\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.600\nyou typically have to wait 6 to 8 weeks\nbefore you've got something back.\n\n53\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.680\n&gt;&gt; I remember ordering a VHS\ntape that I saw off the TV and\n\n54\n00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.890\nI forgot about it by the time\nit [LAUGH] finally came.\n\n55\n00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.799\nAnd now, we're so used to Amazon Prime,\ntwo days and it's here.\n\n56\n00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.494\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And even that's not long enough.\n\n57\n00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:50.878\nNow, we got to get a helicopter\nto bring it to us immediately.\n\n58\n00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:51.465\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah,\n\n59\n00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:53.165\nI can certainly relate to that.\n\n60\n00:02:53.165 --> 00:02:57.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, understand that millennials\nwere in a world of this Amazon world.\n\n61\n00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:01.405\nToday you can order things\nwith Amazon Prime now and\n\n62\n00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:04.410\nget something literally\nalmost within two hours.\n\n63\n00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.150\nI mean how was that for\ninstant, literally.\n\n64\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.420\nAnd we're talking about the drones\nthat now we're coming on,\n\n65\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.470\nthey'll be with you within a few minutes.\n\n66\n00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.920\nI mean, this is crazy, but this is the\nworld that millennials just grew up and\n\n67\n00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.700\nthey didn't know anything else.\n\n68\n00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.990\nI think Gen Xters can most\nrelate to this concept because\n\n69\n00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.650\nin a way of explaining, a boiling water\nGen X'ers grew up in a time of stoves, and\n\n70\n00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.510\nthere was no such thing as microwaves.\n\n71\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.130\nAll of a sudden, when Gen X'ers were\ngetting their adolescent years, and\n\n72\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.370\nGen X'ers were moving into\ngetting a little bit older, and\n\n73\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.570\nbecoming adulthood, they experienced\nsomething called a microwave, right?\n\n74\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.520\nAnd all of a sudden you could warm up\nfood, and boil water Almost instantly,\n\n75\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.460\nwithin a minute, you had boiling water.\n\n76\n00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.010\nBefore that, there was only, stove and\n\n77\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.170\na hot pot, right, that was the only\nway that you could boil water.\n\n78\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.380\nGeneration X, learned what instant\ngratification was through a microwave.\n\n79\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.250\nBut, understand, that's where it stopped.\n\n80\n00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.225\nThat was they only thing that they kind\nof grew up with instant gratification.\n\n81\n00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:07.090\nMillennials, everything around\nthem was instantly gratified.\n\n82\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.980\nEverything around them\nreally that was their world.\n\n83\n00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.320\nSo let's talk about telephones right.\n\n84\n00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.960\nGen X and baby boomers they had a concept\nwhich millennials find kind of stupid and\n\n85\n00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.310\nthey don't understand how it makes sense\nof calling people on a land line right.\n\n86\n00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.330\nDialing a phone that was connected to a\nwall that you couldn't walk more than five\n\n87\n00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.580\nfeet from Calling somebody at their home,\nhopefully they were home.\n\n88\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.320\nIf they weren't home,\nthey had to wait till that person\n\n89\n00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.770\narrived at their destination, typically\nwork or family or friend's house.\n\n90\n00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.780\nWait, and\nthen call that A person there for\n\n91\n00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.480\nthem to actually be able\nto talk to the millennial.\n\n92\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.230\nThat concept to them is crazy, and that\ndoesn't make any sense, because when they\n\n93\n00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.050\nwere growing up understand that\ncell phones was a common thing.\n\n94\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.860\nCell phones was just there world like, so\n\n95\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.500\nto me that's Let's talk on the phone,\ngreat.\n\n96\n00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.390\nWe've picked up our cell phone and\n\n97\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.200\nwe've called, and a cell phone can access\nanybody, anytime, wherever they are.\n\n98\n00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.510\nSo millennials grow up in a world only\nknowing that and so if I wanted to talk to\n\n99\n00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.950\nyou Peter, I would pick up the phone and\nif you're driving, you're at work,\n\n100\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.670\nwherever you are, you just naturally pick\nup the phone, and I talk to you instantly.\n\n101\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.560\nAnd that's the only thing they knew.\n\n102\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.240\nWe can use the same examples as VHSs.\n\n103\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.510\nYou were talking about VHSs.\n\n104\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.380\nA millennial does not know what\na race car tape rewinder is,\n\n105\n00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.980\nand they don't see any purpose for\nthat, right.\n\n106\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.850\nA gen x-er can totally laugh and\nsay my God I had one of those,\n\n107\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.550\nthat's crazy right?\n\n108\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.750\n&gt;&gt; Well otherwise you're spending an extra\ntwo bucks cuz you didn't rewind it.\n\n109\n00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.820\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n110\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.990\nThat was the world that\ngen x-ers grew up in.\n\n111\n00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.050\nBut a millennial says well why\nwould you rewind something?\n\n112\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.830\nLike what is the point or rewinding,\nI've never heard of such a thing.\n\n113\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.200\nThere's a back button on my DVD player,\nI mean that's what I do.\n\n114\n00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.310\nIf I wanna watch a scene again,\nI literally can just press back and\n\n115\n00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.990\nI watch it again.\n\n116\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.280\nIf I wanna watch the movie again, I just\nput menu and start from the beginning.\n\n117\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.080\nBut previous generations,\nthey didn't have that.\n\n118\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.690\nSo, understand that a millennial\njust grew up in a world that\n\n119\n00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.090\ninstant gratification was everything.\n\n120\n00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.880\nEverything that revolved around them\nwas instantly gratified to them.\n\n121\n00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.970\nYou want to music, guess what?\n\n122\n00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.520\nYou've got your Ipod,\nYou can stream things.\n\n123\n00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.980\nYou've got Spotify right now.\n\n124\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.240\nYou've got Itunes and\nyou can get music Right away.\n\n125\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.100\nWhatever song I want, wherever I want,\nas I want it, I get to listen to it.\n\n126\n00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.830\nYou wanna watch TV?\n\n127\n00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:18.490\nGen Xers grew up in a time where we used\nto watch, I mean read a paperview guide,\n\n128\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.640\na physical paperview guide, we would\nsee what time a particular show or\n\n129\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.270\nmovie was gonna play, and we would\nschedule our lives around that show.\n\n130\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.060\nRight, so we would have dinner maybe\nan hour earlier because we wanted to sit\n\n131\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.620\ndown and\nwatch a movie at a particular time.\n\n132\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.950\nAnd, we would have to hold to go to the\nbathroom, because when commercials came,\n\n133\n00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.560\nthat was our time to run.\n\n134\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.420\n&gt;&gt; Serious.\n\n135\n00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.320\nBut you had to watch the commercials too,\nand that was the crazy part.\n\n136\n00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I can already\n\n137\n00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.640\nsee where this is going in the workplace.\n\n138\n00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.850\nEspecially, the bigger company you're at\nthere's going to be more bureaucracy.\n\n139\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.110\nAnd I ask for,\ncan I spend this budget item, or\n\n140\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.660\ncan I Do this project and\nyou want that answer right away.\n\n141\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.380\nYou might be waiting a few days, you might\nbe waiting a few weeks in some cases.\n\n142\n00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.500\nAnd I can see where that\ncan pose a big problem.\n\n143\n00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so again, as company leaders,\nas entrepreneurs,\n\n144\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:11.620\nif we understand that this generation just\nis used to getting things immediately\n\n145\n00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.910\n&gt;&gt; Then we can kind of embrace that and\n\n146\n00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.150\nunderstand where they're coming from.\n\n147\n00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.770\nThis is just the world they came in.\n\n148\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.570\nNow.\n\n149\n00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.930\nhow can we leverage this?\n\n150\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.720\nThis is the power of the millennials.\n\n151\n00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.660\nIf they're expecting this kind\nof return from any service or\n\n152\n00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.080\nany particular thing that they do\n&gt;&gt; Right, we have got to understand that\n\n153\n00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.180\nthey can help us move our organizations\nthat might be a little outdated or\n\n154\n00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.780\nprocesses that might be old.\n\n155\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.370\nThey can help us bring in new concepts,\nnew ideas, new apps, new programs, new\n\n156\n00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.890\nways of doing things that can challenge\nus to be faster and more efficient.\n\n157\n00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.590\nWe just talked about Amazon.\n\n158\n00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.180\nAmazon has become this monster and\nI would bet almost\n\n159\n00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.710\nevery single penny I have that they have a\nstrong team of millennials on their team.\n\n160\n00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.130\nBecause millennials will\nconstantly challenge, well,\n\n161\n00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.270\nwhy does it have to be seven days?\n\n162\n00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.490\nWhy can't we deliver in two days?\n\n163\n00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.670\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying that rather than\ngo to a millennial and say, hey,\n\n164\n00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.420\nwe're gonna train you how to wait\n&gt;&gt; You're saying\n\n165\n00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.130\nlet's pick their brains and\nsay look at our process and\n\n166\n00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.380\nwhy is it taking this long,\nwhere can we make some cuts?\n\n167\n00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right?\n\n168\n00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.405\nMillennials have that power.\n\n169\n00:08:21.405 --> 00:08:22.785\nMillennials will question authority,\n\n170\n00:08:22.785 --> 00:08:24.945\nmillennials will challenge\nyour systems and processes.\n\n171\n00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:27.580\nMillennials will bring this\ninto your organization.\n\n172\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.420\nAnd as leaders, a lot of leaders\nthat I've talked to think, well,\n\n173\n00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.730\nthey're coming in and\nthey think they run the show.\n\n174\n00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.890\nThey think that they know more than me.\n\n175\n00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.120\nThey, just the mindset is just different.\n\n176\n00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.540\nI'm challenging you,\nas leader, to embrace and\n\n177\n00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.330\nlisten that there possibly might\nbe a better way to do something.\n\n178\n00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.670\nThen the way you've done it for\nthe last five or ten years, right?\n\n179\n00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.670\nAnd the technology and\nthe world is moving so\n\n180\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.060\nfast, that even if you just changed\nyour processes or your system in\n\n181\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.370\nthe last 12 months, there's a possibility\nthat something new may have come out.\n\n182\n00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.240\nIf you're not willing to change,\n\n183\n00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.390\nyour company can be extinct\nwithin the next decade.\n\n184\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.610\nI mean, things are moving so, so, so, so\nfast, that what worked yesterday will,\n\n185\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.700\npossibly, not work today,\nespecially, in startup companies,\n\n186\n00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.060\nin fast growing companies, companies\nthat are lead by entrepreneurs that\n\n187\n00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.500\nreally understand this exponential growth,\nand\n\n188\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.295\nhave a long Term, big vision,\nthings will change extremely fast.\n\n189\n00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:25.455\nAnd leveraging the power of this\ngeneration, the coming in and challenging\n\n190\n00:09:25.455 --> 00:09:29.605\nus to say, well why do our customers have\nto wait 7 days to get a final video?\n\n191\n00:09:29.605 --> 00:09:33.735\nWhy do our customers have to wait 2 hours\nto get access to the website, right?\n\n192\n00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:36.050\nWhy can't it just be instant?\n\n193\n00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.820\nAnd when they bring that type of questions\ninto our team and we sit down and\n\n194\n00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.080\nsay well, maybe.\n\n195\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.440\nOkay, well,\nwhat's it gonna take to do that?\n\n196\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.290\nThen you can get such a competitive\nadvantage over your competitor.\n\n197\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.890\nSuch a competitive advantage\nover your entire industry.\n\n198\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.530\nBecause you're just being questioned\non something that, you know.\n\n199\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.710\nAgain, we all get comfortable, right?\n\n200\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.480\nWe live in this comfort box.\n\n201\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.210\nWhere this is the world that we live\nin and our processes are working well.\n\n202\n00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.750\nOur customers are happy.\n\n203\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.660\nBut why can't our customers be happier?\n\n204\n00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.970\nWhy can't we do something faster,\nbetter, right?\n\n205\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.240\n&gt;&gt; The answer of this is\nthe way we've always done it.\n\n206\n00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.840\nThat's not a good answer any more.\n\n207\n00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.640\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\nI mean,\n\n208\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.130\nI would say it's never been a good answer,\nright, but it's been accepted.\n\n209\n00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.470\nAnd I think a lot of organizations\njust kind of say, well, this works.\n\n210\n00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.180\nRight, but there's very few organizations.\n\n211\n00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.880\nAnd these are the ones that\nexperience that exponential growth.\n\n212\n00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.690\nThis is where you create that brand\nloyalty that your customers are gonna\n\n213\n00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.380\ndemand from you no matter what.\n\n214\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.010\nBecause when something better comes out\nthey wanna know that your organization is\n\n215\n00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.150\non the forefront of technology and\nkeeping them forward,\n\n216\n00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.250\nkeeping them into the future,\ninto the new way of doing things.\n\n217\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.120\nAnd again, Amazon's a great example\nFirst there was six to eight weeks.\n\n218\n00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.290\nAmazon said,\nno I want people to get it in a week so\n\n219\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.060\nwe're gonna build our organization\na way to get it in a week.\n\n220\n00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.470\nAnd all the sudden,\nthat became crazy, right?\n\n221\n00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.200\nThat was like, my god,\nyou know Amazon is doing this thing,\n\n222\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.110\nyou get delivery in a week.\n\n223\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.210\nWow, that's crazy, that's crazy.\n\n224\n00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.490\nBut they didn't stop there,\nthey didn't stop there,\n\n225\n00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.330\nwithin a few years, their team come and\nsay, hey, guess what?\n\n226\n00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.380\nWe're gonna try this concept out,\nwe're gonna send you things in two days.\n\n227\n00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.170\nMy God!\n\n228\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.750\nAmazon prime!\nThis is the craziest thing!\n\n229\n00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.440\nTwo days!\n\n230\n00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.890\nRight?\nHow can any competitor compete with that?\n\n231\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.630\nYou can't.\nIt's impossible, right?\n\n232\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.140\nYou cannot even live with that.\n\n233\n00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.220\nBut you raise the standard\nof your industry, and\n\n234\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.610\nthe world continues to progress.\n\n235\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.560\nAnd then guess what?\n\n236\n00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.390\nAmazon has not stopped there.\n\n237\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.730\nSince then, they launched another product.\n\n238\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.490\nAmazon Prime Now.\n\n239\n00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.060\nTwo hours, right?\n\n240\n00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.920\nThey have certain products that they sell,\nthere's only certain areas that offer\n\n241\n00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.490\nAmazon Prime Now, but\nin two hours you can get your products.\n\n242\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.235\nNow, you've just opened\nup a whole can of worms.\n\n243\n00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.610\n[LAUGH] You say, it's impossible.\n\n244\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.730\nSo any of your competitors\nwill look at your company and\n\n245\n00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.970\nsay, There's no way we can\ndo something in two hours.\n\n246\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:41.560\nThat's impossible.\n\n247\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.490\nWhat if our customers order this?\n\n248\n00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.860\nWhat if our customers order that?\n\n249\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.300\nBut those constraints get erased\nwhen you come in somebody as\n\n250\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.470\nquote unquote label it naive.\n\n251\n00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:54.920\nI would call it not tainted with\nbeing in your industry so long.\n\n252\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.110\nTheir naiveness will challenge\nyou to get better and\n\n253\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.500\nopen up new ways of doing things.\n\n254\n00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.420\nAnd as I mentioned,\nAmazon Prime right now I mean,\n\n255\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.600\nthey're doing things in\ndrones in probably what?\n\n256\n00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.725\nHalf an hour.\n\n257\n00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:09.737\n[CROSSTALK] I mean, that's crazy and\nI guarantee you, mark my words,\n\n258\n00:12:09.737 --> 00:12:11.103\nit will not stop there.\n\n259\n00:12:11.103 --> 00:12:14.870\nYou will literally start seeing\nthings instantly, instantly.\n\n260\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.800\nThat's where it's going and\nAmazon is not gonna stop there.\n\n261\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.560\nPerfect example of\na company that guarantees\n\n262\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.480\nit has a strong team of millennials that\ncontinues to challenge their mindset.\n\n263\n00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.590\nAnd again, in this concept of instant\ngratification We got to stop looking at\n\n264\n00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.870\nit as a bad thing, and figure out\nhow can we leverage this talent.\n\n265\n00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.440\nHow can we leverage this into our\norganizations, and really help us\n\n266\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.660\nbring power, really dominate our\nindustry by the power of Millennials.\n\n267\n00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.780\n&gt;&gt; And I think Mike you take away from\nthis episode is that instant gratification\n\n268\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.660\nis not a bad thing, and say aw these\nguys want instant gratification.\n\n269\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.570\nBut instead we say hey, this is something\nwe should strive for in our company,\n\n270\n00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.950\nso that makes a lot of sense.\n\n271\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.410\nAny final thoughts?\n\n272\n00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.210\n&gt;&gt; No, I think that's pretty much it.\n\n273\n00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.540\nThat covers the concept and\n\n274\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:02.730\njust understanding that their mindset\nComes from a place of their entire world,\n\n275\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.460\nas they were growing up,\nwas all instantly gratified.\n\n276\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.740\nThey didn't know any different.\n\n277\n00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.790\nThey didn't know that they had to wait for\ncertain things.\n\n278\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.630\nSo again, the culture really dominates and\nit's our job as entrepenuers and as\n\n279\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.930\nbusiness owners and as business leaders to\nreally create a culture where we embrace\n\n280\n00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.810\nthis kind of thinking, and not necessarily\njust reject and flat out say This is not\n\n281\n00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:28.180\nwhat I want here, cuz again that will lead\nto your company possibly being extinct.\n\n282\n00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.060\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\nWell that's a very important concept.\n\n283\n00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.860\nI know we've got a lot more great concepts\nin the book and we're gonna cover a lot\n\n284\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.690\nof those so definitely stick around and\nstay tuned for more episodes.\n\n285\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.660\nBut signing off for this one,\nI'm your host Peter Van Reisdam.\n\n286\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.540\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Javier Montez,\na millennial expert.\n\n287\n00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.461\nSee you in the next episode.\n\n288\n00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:53.461\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I'm doing fantastic Peter.\n\n8\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.390\nI'm excited to be here, and\n\n9\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.030\nreally dive real deep into\nunderstanding the Millennial mindset.\n\n10\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.760\nAnd actually what makes Millennials\nthink and act the way that they do.\n\n11\n00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what are we talking\nabout in this episode then?\n\n12\n00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.950\n&gt;&gt; In this episode we gonna dive into\na really cool concept that a lot of\n\n13\n00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.020\npeople haven't heard, some people have,\nbut it's a term called helicopter parent.\n\n14\n00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.315\nEver heard of that, Peter?\n\n15\n00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:41.815\n&gt;&gt; I certainly have.\n&gt;&gt; You have?\n\n16\n00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:42.315\n&gt;&gt; I have.\n\n17\n00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:42.915\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\n\n18\n00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:44.881\nSo let's get right into it.\n\n19\n00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:45.693\nLet's define it.\n\n20\n00:00:45.693 --> 00:00:46.994\nWhat is a helicopter parent, and\n\n21\n00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:49.770\nwhere did this come from?\nI think the term was coined probably\n\n22\n00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.430\naround the year 2000 or so.\n\n23\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.460\nAnd this term came from two gentlemen.\n\n24\n00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.110\nI forgot their names.\n\n25\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.934\nBut they coined this term to\ndescribe parents hovering over\n\n26\n00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:04.087\ntheir children so\nas to protect them from any harm.\n\n27\n00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:07.882\nAnd that's why they are called helicopter\nparents cuz they're hovering over their\n\n28\n00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:09.068\nkinds like a helicopter.\n\n29\n00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:12.370\nAnd this is a term that has\na negative connotation I would say.\n\n30\n00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.688\nIs that something you'd agree with?\n\n31\n00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:16.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nits definitely a negative connotation.\n\n32\n00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.900\nI think that, this is something\nthat happened during this time that\n\n33\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.140\nprobably should not have happened.\n\n34\n00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.190\nBut again,\nit shaped the way the Millennials grew up.\n\n35\n00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.620\nAnd it shaped the way that they think.\n\n36\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.190\nAnd this is part of their life experience.\n\n37\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.870\nSo now what we can do\nis we can know from it.\n\n38\n00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.781\nWe know that's probably not\nthe best way of parenting.\n\n39\n00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:37.230\nHindsight is always 20/20, right?\n\n40\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.680\nWe learn from our past experiences.\n\n41\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.530\nAnd at the time it may\nhave seemed to make sense.\n\n42\n00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.910\nAnd again Millenial parents were\nthinking this was the way to do it.\n\n43\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.820\nAnd we'll talk now about what happened.\n\n44\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.968\nAnd what did that create?\n\n45\n00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:54.870\n&gt;&gt; And I think, there's a lot of\narguments for why this has taken place.\n\n46\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.890\nBut I remember as a kid,\nwe'd hop on our bikes and\n\n47\n00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.840\nwe'd drive to the convenience store.\n\n48\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.590\nAnd we couldn't have been more than 7 or\n8 years old.\n\n49\n00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.515\nAnd we're a mile and a half down\nthe street, crossing a big road.\n\n50\n00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:08.456\nAnd I've got an eight year old daughter,\nand\n\n51\n00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:10.304\nI can't imagine letting that happen now.\n\n52\n00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:11.893\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I think part of that,\n\n53\n00:02:11.893 --> 00:02:15.865\nyou kind of make the case in your mind of,\nthere's all these predators out there now.\n\n54\n00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:17.235\nThere's all these bad\nthings that can happen.\n\n55\n00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:19.995\nBut those things existed back then too.\n\n56\n00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:23.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they did exist back then.\n\n57\n00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.400\nAnd I think that this, maybe,\nhas come to fruition a lot more.\n\n58\n00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.530\nMaybe because of media.\n\n59\n00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.730\nOr maybe because it's just been pushed so\nmuch and repeated so much.\n\n60\n00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.440\nThat I've found that people\nrepeat a lot of things and\n\n61\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.220\nit tends to create more\nfear than anything else.\n\n62\n00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.210\nBut nonetheless, we did learn that\nhelicopter parenting is not necessarily\n\n63\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.830\nthe best way to parent children.\n\n64\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.720\nSo let's talk about what\nhappened to these Millennials.\n\n65\n00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.666\nWhat happened to these Millennials?\n\n66\n00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.570\nAnd what did they experience?\n\n67\n00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.640\nAnd how did that affect their life?\n\n68\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.730\nAnd how does it affect them\nnow in their work place,\n\n69\n00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.840\nby having parents that were\nhelicoptering over these children?\n\n70\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.640\nSo, let's define what happened.\n\n71\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.280\nSo children would be going to school,\nchildren would be in sports teams,\n\n72\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.300\nwe talked about this\nin a previous episode.\n\n73\n00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.810\nAnd the parents would literally\nbe protecting their child.\n\n74\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.270\nWe talked in another episode about\nprotecting your self-esteem.\n\n75\n00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.060\nBut aside from that,\n\n76\n00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.110\nthey were protecting their child from any\nharm that would come to this child, right?\n\n77\n00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.210\nSo what would happen?\n\n78\n00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.190\nI think a couple of the main things that\nwere very prominent during this time where\n\n79\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.410\nare the parents being involved with\nthe child's schooling and their teachers.\n\n80\n00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.268\nSo when the child would get a bad\ngrade at school the parents\n\n81\n00:03:33.268 --> 00:03:37.207\nbecame extremely involved,\nwent to the teacher and said,\n\n82\n00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:40.221\nteacher why did you give\nmy child this grade?\n\n83\n00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:44.960\nNow, it sounds kind of crazy now\nthat we're talking about it.\n\n84\n00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.200\nBut parents started to blame the teachers,\nthe educators,\n\n85\n00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.450\nthe coaches, for giving the students\nthe grades that they earned.\n\n86\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.850\n&gt;&gt; And even in cases, the other kid.\n\n87\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.494\nWell why did you push my kid in the soccer\ngame, you know to the other children?\n\n88\n00:04:01.494 --> 00:04:04.390\nOr why aren't you playing my kid enough,\nto the coach.\n\n89\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what had happened.\n\n90\n00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.560\nAnd what did this create?\n\n91\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.610\nOkay, two things it created.\n\n92\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.440\nThe first thing that it created\nwas the Millennial child\n\n93\n00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.050\nbecame dependant on always having\na bodyguard, per say, to defend them.\n\n94\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.820\nSo many millenials didn't necessarily\nlearn how to defend themselves,\n\n95\n00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.280\nhow to stand up for themselves.\n\n96\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.770\nAnd even if they did a little bit,\nthey always were used to having somebody\n\n97\n00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.600\nbehind them,\nsomebody that would stand up for them.\n\n98\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.283\nAnd speak for\n\n99\n00:04:32.283 --> 00:04:36.453\nthem and kind of, this person that\nwould have my back 1,000% of the time.\n\n100\n00:04:36.453 --> 00:04:37.890\nSo that's the first thing that happened.\n\n101\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.220\nThey got used to that.\n\n102\n00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.210\nAnd that was, again,\nthe world that was created for them.\n\n103\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.680\nThe second thing that happened was\nthat this type of parenting created\n\n104\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.730\nthis mindset of the parents\nwanting to be friends,\n\n105\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.850\n'' best friends'', with their children.\n\n106\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.780\nThey no longer created this\nauthority relationship.\n\n107\n00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.150\nWhere I'm the parent and you're the child,\ntherefore, I am the authority.\n\n108\n00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.440\nThey created this concept of,\nwe're friends.\n\n109\n00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.600\nAnd we're best friends.\n\n110\n00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.170\nAnd we're gonna stay best friends for\nour entire lives.\n\n111\n00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.905\nAnd again,\nwhile that sounded great at the beginning.\n\n112\n00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:17.590\nLet's fast forward today and\nhow did it affect these children?\n\n113\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.110\nSo, how it really affected\nthese children is, number one,\n\n114\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.160\nthey became best friends\nwith their parents.\n\n115\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.110\nAnd lost what it was like to\nhave a sense of authority.\n\n116\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.822\nSo when parents are no longer here,\nwhen they go into the workplace,\n\n117\n00:05:34.822 --> 00:05:38.803\nwhen they go into schooling,\nwhen they go into the world,\n\n118\n00:05:38.803 --> 00:05:43.598\nthese Millennials have, I don't wanna say,\na full loss of respect,\n\n119\n00:05:43.598 --> 00:05:47.046\nbut a much lesser level of respect for\nauthority.\n\n120\n00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:47.561\nRight, so\n\n121\n00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:51.320\nyou're gonna see that Millennials will\nstart to challenge authority a lot.\n\n122\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.340\nThey will, in essence,\ntalk back to authority figures.\n\n123\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.844\nBecause they don't see\nthem as much as authority.\n\n124\n00:05:57.844 --> 00:06:00.324\nThey were taught that these\nare my best friends and\n\n125\n00:06:00.324 --> 00:06:03.112\nyou can challenge what they say and\nverify it yourself.\n\n126\n00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:05.551\nSo just because an authority\nfigure says something,\n\n127\n00:06:05.551 --> 00:06:08.656\nyou don't accept it as necessarily true,\nyou go find it yourself.\n\n128\n00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:11.130\n&gt;&gt; Do you see then, at the same time,\n\n129\n00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.580\ndo they expect that same level of watching\nover and protecting you from their boss?\n\n130\n00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so they are looking for\nthat as well.\n\n131\n00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.695\nSo in every relationship\nwith this authority figure,\n\n132\n00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:27.506\nthey also expect that their\nboss has their back a 1,000%.\n\n133\n00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:29.290\nNow that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n134\n00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.610\nBut we have to understand that\nthe relationship that they're expecting\n\n135\n00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.010\nis very similar to that\nkind of relationship.\n\n136\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.410\nSo when they have a boss who\nis not defending them or\n\n137\n00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.496\na boss who is not ''protecting'' them,\nthis creates a disconnect.\n\n138\n00:06:43.496 --> 00:06:46.590\nAnd the Millennial can\npossibly leave that company or\n\n139\n00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.310\ngo find another company because they're\nlooking for that kind of relationship.\n\n140\n00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.152\nBut going back to the other topic,\n\n141\n00:06:53.152 --> 00:06:58.710\nwhich was about the Millennials\nchallenging authority.\n\n142\n00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.000\nIt sounds like a bad thing, right?\n\n143\n00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.880\nBut again, I keep stressing this concept\nof no generation is better or worse.\n\n144\n00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.240\nThere's differences and\n\n145\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.370\nif we can understand those differences\nthen we can meet somewhere halfway.\n\n146\n00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.080\nAnd really leverage the power of\neach of the generations, right?\n\n147\n00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.630\nSo what does them challenging\nauthority have to do with business?\n\n148\n00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.610\nAnd how can we use this in our companies?\n\n149\n00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.440\nWell, again, we talked about\nthis in a previous episode, but\n\n150\n00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.000\na Millennial will challenge\nsomething that you're saying.\n\n151\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.020\nSo when a boss says something,\nwhen a supervisor says something,\n\n152\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.660\nthe Millennial will come back and\nsay well, why?\n\n153\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.472\nAnd ask why.\n\n154\n00:07:34.472 --> 00:07:35.119\nAnd probe why.\n\n155\n00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:37.658\nAnd a lot of times,\nus as entrepreneurs, again,\n\n156\n00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:41.730\nwe're going back to we just do things\nbecause we've always done them that way.\n\n157\n00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.600\n&gt;&gt; Because I said so.\n\n158\n00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.040\nBecause I'm the boss, right?\n\n159\n00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.052\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n160\n00:07:45.052 --> 00:07:51.135\nMillennials have a very low tolerance\nto accept those kind of answers.\n\n161\n00:07:51.135 --> 00:07:54.235\nMillennials will not sit down and\nstay quiet when you give those types\n\n162\n00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:56.455\nof answers,\nbecause that's not a justified answer.\n\n163\n00:07:56.455 --> 00:08:00.535\nAnd if we sit back and think about it,\nno, that's not a good answer.\n\n164\n00:08:00.535 --> 00:08:03.475\nIf we're talking about business and\nwe're talking about\n\n165\n00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:07.640\nwhat's going on in our companies\nbecause I said so is not a good reason.\n\n166\n00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.990\nYou can't use that to explain\nit to a board of directors.\n\n167\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.050\nSo how can you explain it to your team?\n\n168\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.030\nHow can you push it down just because\nyou're the authority doesn't mean\n\n169\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.840\nthat that's the right answer.\n\n170\n00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.845\nThe other answer we could typically\nget when we don't know the answer,\n\n171\n00:08:20.845 --> 00:08:22.420\nwell we've always done it that way.\n\n172\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.980\nAnd that's the way it needs to be\ndone because that's what works.\n\n173\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.260\nWell, like I mentioned before, what worked\nyesterday won't necessarily work tomorrow.\n\n174\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.730\nSo if we can have an open mind to look and\nthink, well is this the best way?\n\n175\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.300\nAsk our Millennials, well okay I may see\nthat there could be an opportunity for\n\n176\n00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.920\nit to not be the best way,\nwhat would you recommend?\n\n177\n00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.090\nWhat ideas do you have?\n\n178\n00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.430\nAnd again, creating that culture that\nis a safe environment, not only for\n\n179\n00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.390\nMillennials but for the rest of your team\nto give suggestions and offer better or\n\n180\n00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.670\nnew ways of doing things\nwould open the door to\n\n181\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.960\nreally revolutionize your organization,\nreally revolutionize your team.\n\n182\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.521\nAnd if you create an environment\nthat's safe for this type of dialogue,\n\n183\n00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:11.500\nit becomes very conducive to learning, to\ngrowth, to an amazing and happy work life.\n\n184\n00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.740\nSo we gotta learn to leverage\nthis challenging authority.\n\n185\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.620\nBecause I guarantee, I guarantee in\nevery organization that I visit today,\n\n186\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.620\nevery company that I talk to, and I talk\nto a lot of employees in those companies.\n\n187\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.505\nAnd I will ask them if they have an idea\non how they can do something better,\n\n188\n00:09:27.505 --> 00:09:30.730\n95% of the time the answer is yes.\n\n189\n00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.060\nAnd they have something.\n\n190\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.700\nAnd I ask them have you\ntold your supervisor?\n\n191\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.930\nHave you told the owner of\nthe company about this?\n\n192\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.430\nAnd their answer is, no I'm not\nsure they would be well received.\n\n193\n00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.390\nNo, I'm not sure I can.\n\n194\n00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.820\nNo, I never had the opportunity or\nnobody's ever asked me.\n\n195\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.700\n&gt;&gt; So it sounds like what you are saying\nis that this helicopter parenting thing\n\n196\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.530\nmaybe wasn't the best idea and it had some\nnegative consequences in terms of respect,\n\n197\n00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.510\nlack of respect for authority, maybe.\n\n198\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.940\nBut at the same time,\nthere are some benefits to this,\n\n199\n00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.360\nif we understand what those are,\nwe can pull those out of our employees.\n\n200\n00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.509\n&gt;&gt; Correct!\nAnd also lack of respect.\n\n201\n00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:09.411\nI'm gonna use that term loosely\njust because it's easy for\n\n202\n00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:11.580\nus to understand that terminology.\n\n203\n00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.500\nBut a Millennial doesn't\ncome into the workplace and\n\n204\n00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.440\nchallenge authority in an effort\nto be purposely disrespectful.\n\n205\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.200\nWe need to understand.\n\n206\n00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.370\nThey're not coming in and trying to say,\nI wanna disrespect you on purpose.\n\n207\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.060\nAnd my goal in life is to try to\nbe disrespectful to authority,\n\n208\n00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.640\nbecause I don't respect authority.\n\n209\n00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.140\nI'm not saying that at all.\n\n210\n00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:33.394\nWhat I'm saying is that they have\nno problem challenging authority.\n\n211\n00:10:33.394 --> 00:10:37.860\nAnd they won't accept what you tell\nthem just because you're an authority.\n\n212\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:43.066\nSo embrace the fact that they have\nthe courage to stand up and say well,\n\n213\n00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:49.255\nwhy is that, and to question you, and\nquestion the way that you're doing things.\n\n214\n00:10:49.255 --> 00:10:51.980\nIt can truly revolutionize\nyour organization.\n\n215\n00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.940\nAnd truly revolutionize\nthe culture in your company.\n\n216\n00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.650\nIf you're open enough to\nembrace that concept and\n\n217\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.900\nsay well let's really dive deeper.\n\n218\n00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.700\nI mean we do things on\na regular basis all the time.\n\n219\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.000\nI do them too,\ncuz we just do things so much.\n\n220\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.910\nSo we're so used to it.\n\n221\n00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.388\nAnd we have a process that works.\n\n222\n00:11:07.388 --> 00:11:12.040\nThat we say, well, it's working so\nif it's not broke, don't fix it.\n\n223\n00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.172\nWhy would we even do that, right?\n\n224\n00:11:14.172 --> 00:11:17.530\nBut you get a Millennial to come into\nyour company, and you start them off in\n\n225\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.100\nan intro position, you're not into\nthe weeds, into what they're doing.\n\n226\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.330\nMaybe your phone system\nis completely outdated.\n\n227\n00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.030\nHow we transfer calls is totally outdated.\n\n228\n00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.540\nA Millennial says well,\nwhy would we do that?\n\n229\n00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.580\nWhy don't you guys try this app?\n\n230\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.310\nHey, it could be a lot better.\n\n231\n00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.770\nBut our customers need music on hold.\n\n232\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.610\nYeah, but we can change the music on hold.\n\n233\n00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.920\nWe can customize the music on hold.\n\n234\n00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.600\nWe can do this.\n\n235\n00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.400\nWhy not do that?\n\n236\n00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.000\nAnd most of the time with\nthe way technology is going,\n\n237\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.930\nit's probably even gonna save us money,\ntoo.\n\n238\n00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which is crazy.\n\n239\n00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.890\n&gt;&gt; This is a great concept\nbecause I don't think this\n\n240\n00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.980\nphenomenon of helicopter parenting\nis going away anytime soon.\n\n241\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.950\nI imagine we'll probably have a\nrenaissance somewhere in the future where\n\n242\n00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.850\nthings go back to parenting the old way.\n\n243\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.179\nAnd getting beat up builds character and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n244\n00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:03.966\nAnd we were joking in the break that\nhelicopter parenting in five years might\n\n245\n00:12:03.966 --> 00:12:06.650\nbe someone has a drone\nfollowing their kid around.\n\n246\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.025\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou never know where this is gonna go.\n\n247\n00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:09.323\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You never know.\n\n248\n00:12:09.323 --> 00:12:10.967\nI can only imagine the future just\nlittle drones following their\n\n249\n00:12:10.967 --> 00:12:11.581\nchildren everywhere.\n\n250\n00:12:11.581 --> 00:12:14.904\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have GPS watches on our kids\n\n251\n00:12:14.904 --> 00:12:15.670\nnowadays.\n\n252\n00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.542\nThat's kind of a helicopter\nparenting type of method.\n\n253\n00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:20.041\nWe wanna know where they go and what not.\n\n254\n00:12:20.041 --> 00:12:23.100\nBut those things are soon\nhaving cameras in them.\n\n255\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.770\nBefore you know, we're might have\ndrones following them around.\n\n256\n00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.460\nYou never know where this is going, right?\n\n257\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.290\nSo I agree with you, I don't think\nhelicopter parenting is going to go away.\n\n258\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.240\nI think as Millennials become parents\n\n259\n00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.570\nI think that they will change their way of\nthinking, just like every generation does.\n\n260\n00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.560\nBecause I think that they\nwill start to realize through\n\n261\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.240\npeople like me who\nare explaining these concepts.\n\n262\n00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.330\nThey say well, I may not wanna\nparent my children this way, right?\n\n263\n00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.670\nI want them to have full respect for\nauthority.\n\n264\n00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.640\nI want them to really learn\nto defend themselves.\n\n265\n00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.850\nSo I wanna push them to go through\na little bit of struggles so\n\n266\n00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.370\nthat they can learn and\nbe stronger from there.\n\n267\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.730\nSo I think as generations go,\nevery generation changes\n\n268\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.200\nwhat they didn't like from the previous\ngeneration, or the way they were parented.\n\n269\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.720\nI think every person always says well,\nI wanna provide for\n\n270\n00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.600\nmy children a better life than I had for\nmyself.\n\n271\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.970\nSo they work a little bit harder, or\nthey just change things a little bit.\n\n272\n00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.780\nAnd we gotta understand, again,\nit's just different generations.\n\n273\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.320\nNot one's bad, not one's better,\nnot one's worse, right?\n\n274\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.680\nIt's just different.\n\n275\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.437\nAnd the environment that we're raised\nin is what creates what we think.\n\n276\n00:13:29.437 --> 00:13:32.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what you said earlier,\nis that it's not their fault.\n\n277\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.100\nThis is the way they were raised.\n\n278\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.500\nThis is all they've known.\n\n279\n00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.700\nAnd so\nit's kind of up to us to understand that.\n\n280\n00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.960\nAnd see how we can work with it.\n\n281\n00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.860\nAnd how we can get the most\nout of that type of employee.\n\n282\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.170\nAny other thoughts on\nhelicopter parenting?\n\n283\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.970\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily on\nhelicopter parenting.\n\n284\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.956\nI do just wanna just leave\nthat my book was written\n\n285\n00:13:53.956 --> 00:13:58.541\nbecause my entire workforce\nis entirely Millennials.\n\n286\n00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:00.794\nAnd they've been with me long term, and\n\n287\n00:14:00.794 --> 00:14:05.653\nI've created an environment that allows\nmy team to challenge me 100% of the time.\n\n288\n00:14:05.653 --> 00:14:08.640\nThat allows them to challenge\nthemselves 100% of the time.\n\n289\n00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.850\nSo, I don't take any offense,\nI don't see their questioning,\n\n290\n00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.010\ntheir challenging as disrespect.\n\n291\n00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.910\nAnd if we can embrace that, I challenge\nall the entrepreneurs that are watching\n\n292\n00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.410\nthis, all the business leaders\nthat are watching this.\n\n293\n00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.989\nDon't just be quick to dismiss somebody\nand label them as disrespectful,\n\n294\n00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:27.723\nall right.\n\n295\n00:14:27.723 --> 00:14:29.094\nDon't be that way.\n\n296\n00:14:29.094 --> 00:14:32.307\nBecause they may be wanting to\ncontribute to the organisation,\n\n297\n00:14:32.307 --> 00:14:36.113\nthey're passionate about the company,\ntheir passionate about being with\n\n298\n00:14:36.113 --> 00:14:38.567\nyour company and\nthis is the way they express it.\n\n299\n00:14:38.567 --> 00:14:40.330\nThey say well, what about this?\n\n300\n00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:42.800\nWhat about this?\n\n301\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.680\nOr why does it have to be that way?\n\n302\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.550\nSo embrace that change.\n\n303\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.860\nEmbrace the mindset of the Millennial.\n\n304\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.196\nAnd say, again, how can I use\nthis to benefit my organization?\n\n305\n00:14:53.196 --> 00:14:55.425\nAnd really leverage the power\nof this generation.\n\n306\n00:14:55.425 --> 00:14:56.735\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nThe companies that change\n\n307\n00:14:56.735 --> 00:14:58.545\nare the companies that succeed today.\n\n308\n00:14:58.545 --> 00:14:59.301\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n309\n00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:02.958\n&gt;&gt; And so it's certainly important\nto understand how to work with these\n\n310\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:03.656\nemployees.\n\n311\n00:15:03.656 --> 00:15:06.809\nAnd I know we've got a lot more\ninformation, not just in the book, but\n\n312\n00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:07.732\nin these episodes.\n\n313\n00:15:07.732 --> 00:15:09.952\nToday we're gonna talk about\nworking with Millennials.\n\n314\n00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:14.022\nSo let's get that, but for now signing\noff I've been your host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n315\n00:15:14.022 --> 00:15:16.172\n&gt;&gt; And this is Javier Montes\nyour Millennial expert,\n\n316\n00:15:16.172 --> 00:15:17.678\nwe'll see you at the next episode.\n\n317\n00:15:17.678 --> 00:15:19.111\n&gt;&gt; Bye.\n\n318\n00:15:19.111 --> 00:15:29.111\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

host, Peter VanRysdam, and\n\n4\n00:00:07.253 --> 00:00:11.357\ntoday we're continuing in our series about\nworking with millennials and specifically\n\n5\n00:00:11.357 --> 00:00:14.975\nin this episode we're gonna talk about\ndealing with their optimism at work.\n\n6\n00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:16.685\nAnd here to help us\nunderstand what that means,\n\n7\n00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:19.685\nwe have the author of the book,\nMillennial Workforce, Javier Montes.\n\n8\n00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:20.515\nJavier, how are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:21.895\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Peter.\n\n10\n00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:22.565\nIt's great to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:23.835\nThank you for having me on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:24.735\nIt's really a pleasure.\n\n13\n00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:30.765\nAnd yeah, we're gonna dive right into the\nmillennial mindset and what is it about\n\n14\n00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:34.355\nthese millennials that really makes them\nthink and tick the way that they tick.\n\n15\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.730\nI'm really excited about\nthis topic because this is,\n\n16\n00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.870\nI think, one of the topics which\nis actually a very good thing.\n\n17\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.940\nAnd it's a very positive thing that\ncomes from a very positive place.\n\n18\n00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.990\nAnd it's one of the characteristics\nabout millennials that's really unique\n\n19\n00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.130\nthat we don't really talk about so much.\n\n20\n00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.220\nBecause, again, the media and\nsocial media and\n\n21\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.820\nall this really blows up a lot of negative\nstuff because negative stuff sells books.\n\n22\n00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.760\nNegative stuff is more publicity.\n\n23\n00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.150\nAnd people don't talk about the positive,\nreally good things, right?\n\n24\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.110\nIt's always the sexy things that we talk\nabout and what's exciting and what sells.\n\n25\n00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.080\nBut this generation of millennials,\n\n26\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.520\none of their characteristics is\nthat they are naturally optimistic.\n\n27\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.080\nNow what does that mean?\n\n28\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.860\nObviously we know what\nthe word optimistic means.\n\n29\n00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.730\nBut how did they become\nnaturally optimistic?\n\n30\n00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.070\nHow did this generation naturally\nlearn to be positive and\n\n31\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.640\nhave such a positive outlook on life?\n\n32\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.870\nAnd let's dive into that.\n\n33\n00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.120\nAnd going back to how\ntheir minds are shaped,\n\n34\n00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.670\nall of it comes from the way that they\nexperienced life and the way that they\n\n35\n00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.520\nlived life throughout the times when they\nwere adolescents and going into adulthood.\n\n36\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.750\nSo if we go into what the millennials\nexperienced during this time,\n\n37\n00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.290\nwe're gonna think about the years 2007,\n2008, right around that time.\n\n38\n00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.100\nAnd this is a time when millennials were\nbeginning to start getting out of college,\n\n39\n00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.520\ngoing into the work force.\n\n40\n00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.790\nAnd let's talk about the world\nthat was going on at this time.\n\n41\n00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.610\nSo, in this time, the financial crisis\nof the world had just happened.\n\n42\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.120\nThe realistic bubble had just burst.\n\n43\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.040\nA lot of bad things had\nhappened during this time.\n\n44\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.235\nAnd as a country,\nwe came together pretty well.\n\n45\n00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:19.355\nAnd I think that the world was\nlooking at our country and saying,\n\n46\n00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.215\nwell, where are we gonna go from here?\n\n47\n00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:26.015\nAnd what that caused is that caused\nthe media, I think every single\n\n48\n00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:30.107\nmedia outlet you went to, everywhere\nyou looked, every single banner,\n\n49\n00:02:30.107 --> 00:02:34.994\nevery single billboard that was out,\nwas a very positive banner telling us\n\n50\n00:02:34.994 --> 00:02:39.657\nas a country that we should come\ntogether and let's rebuild what we had.\n\n51\n00:02:39.657 --> 00:02:40.267\nRight?\nSo\n\n52\n00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:44.057\nduring this time of adolescence for\nmillennials,\n\n53\n00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:47.907\nthey were in a world where everybody\nwas talking about getting better.\n\n54\n00:02:47.907 --> 00:02:49.727\nEverybody was talking about rebuilding.\n\n55\n00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:53.490\nAll the media was saying,\nwe are going to get through this.\n\n56\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.920\nAnd millennials kind of\nembrace this as their own.\n\n57\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.890\nThey learned that, hey,\nwe should be optimistic about the future.\n\n58\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.070\nWe should be positive\nabout what's going on.\n\n59\n00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.910\nWe got through 9/11, we can get through\nthis and we can get through anything.\n\n60\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.240\nAnd this is where they embraced and\n\n61\n00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.755\nthis became part of their psyche that they\nshould live in a very optimistic world.\n\n62\n00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:15.520\nBecause-.\n\n63\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.850\n&gt;&gt; Without getting political too, this is\nthe time where probably a lot of them were\n\n64\n00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.820\nfirst voting and getting involved in\nthe first elections and yes, we can.\n\n65\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.290\nThat kind of optimistic thing.\n\n66\n00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.050\nA lot of young people got\ncaught up in that as well.\n\n67\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think that's part of them.\n\n68\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.060\nWe saw campaigns that were pushing that.\n\n69\n00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.620\nAnd millennials immediately\nconnected with that.\n\n70\n00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.340\nSaid yeah, of course, of course.\n\n71\n00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.510\nAnd that really drove elections.\n\n72\n00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.055\nI mean you run your entire campaign\nwith that kind of mindset,\n\n73\n00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:43.240\nmillennials were like, yeah,\nI totally get it, yeah, we can.\n\n74\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.480\nAnd who's gonna argue with\npositivity like that, right?\n\n75\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.090\nWho's gonna argue with, or\nwho's gonna disagree with saying,\n\n76\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.520\nyes, let's come together as a country, and\nlet's rebuild this, and let's get better,\n\n77\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.740\nand let's be stronger,\nand let's be one unit?\n\n78\n00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.800\nI mean, nobody, right?\n\n79\n00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.280\nNobody's gonna disagree with that.\n\n80\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.430\nBut the key is that millennials\nwere in this world and\n\n81\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.860\nthey actually saw things getting better.\n\n82\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.110\nSo it wasn't just lip service,\nbecause we were actually getting better.\n\n83\n00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.707\nI mean, the truth is that we were\nkind of at the bottom of the bottom.\n\n84\n00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:12.716\nThere was really almost only\none place to go, right?\n\n85\n00:04:12.716 --> 00:04:13.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.980\n&gt;&gt; So put yourself in a millennial.\n\n87\n00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.490\nWhen you actually start to comprehend\nthe world outside of your household,\n\n88\n00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.940\nwhich is your adolescent years,\nyou start to see that there's\n\n89\n00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.080\na world beyond your parents and\nthe four walls in the school you go to.\n\n90\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.530\nWhen they start to see that,\n\n91\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.760\nthe first thing they see in\nthe world is let's get better.\n\n92\n00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.430\nAnd our economy is horrible but\nwe're gonna get better.\n\n93\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.408\nMore jobs are coming.\n\n94\n00:04:33.408 --> 00:04:36.100\nOur stock market's gonna go up.\n\n95\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.630\nAnd they start hearing this and all of\na sudden they started repeating it because\n\n96\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.340\nwe naturally repeat everything we hear.\n\n97\n00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.850\nAnd all of a sudden,\nthe world actually starts to get better.\n\n98\n00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.870\nSo they said, wait a second.\n\n99\n00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.080\nI believe that the world's\ngonna get better.\n\n100\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.100\nI'm saying the world's gonna get better.\n\n101\n00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.510\nAnd the world is actually getting better.\n\n102\n00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.650\nTherefore, this must be true.\n\n103\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.800\nThis now became part of their world.\n\n104\n00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.010\nSo millennials will\nnaturally learn to adopt and\n\n105\n00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.060\nembrace that they need to be optimistic,\nand now optimistic is the way to be.\n\n106\n00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.660\nThe cool thing about this is that\nmillennials naturally think that\n\n107\n00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.300\nno matter where you are in life, the world\nin the future is gonna get better.\n\n108\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.579\nSo how do we bring this\ninto the workplace?\n\n109\n00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:16.282\nAnd how does this play\na role in our workplace?\n\n110\n00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:21.010\nI would say some previous generations,\ndepending on which generation, there was\n\n111\n00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.560\na time when adolescent years was actually\ngoing through the Great Depression.\n\n112\n00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.190\nWhen adolescent years was\ngoing through very trivial and\n\n113\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.170\ntough times in our country's history.\n\n114\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.560\nI mean somebody had to go through them,\nright?\n\n115\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.980\nSo previous generations may\nhave gone through those times.\n\n116\n00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.120\nNow, what did that create?\n\n117\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.180\nThat created previous generations to\nbe driven by this sense of security and\n\n118\n00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.050\nlonging to be safe.\n\n119\n00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.860\nLike I don't want to lose my assets.\n\n120\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.450\nI need to save for retirement.\n\n121\n00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.760\nI need to build this nest egg.\n\n122\n00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.670\nI need to put up with a job that I\nhate because I need to be secure and\n\n123\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.950\nI need to make sure my family is secured.\n\n124\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.480\nMillennials, on the other hand,\n\n125\n00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.600\nmillennials grew up with this sense of\noptimistic and longing for happiness.\n\n126\n00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.590\nThey're really, really big on this.\n\n127\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.420\nSo therefore, when we bring them into our\nculture, into our workplace, what happens?\n\n128\n00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.650\nWe're bringing in this influx of\npositivity into our company that naturally\n\n129\n00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.500\ninjects through the rest of the team\nwith this attitude of yes, we can.\n\n130\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.590\nSo when the leader says, guys,\nthis year, we're not gonna grow 5%,\n\n131\n00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.785\nwe wanna grow 50%.\n\n132\n00:06:23.785 --> 00:06:26.860\nOlder generations will be like,\nI don't know.\n\n133\n00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.650\nThat's kinda risky.\n\n134\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.290\nShould we do that?\n\n135\n00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.000\nMaybe we shouldn't.\n\n136\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.770\nI don't know.\n\n137\n00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.020\nWhat kind of impact that's gonna\nhave on the rest of our team and\n\n138\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.120\ndo we have the budget for that?\n\n139\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.380\nWe start to think these things.\n\n140\n00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.630\nMillennials think yes, we can!\n\n141\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.770\nEverybody, let's do it!\n\n142\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.490\nI love it.\nAnd they get\n\n143\n00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.280\nmotivated by these lofty goals.\n\n144\n00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.910\nNow what kind of energy or chemistry\ndoes that create amongst your team?\n\n145\n00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.550\nWhat kind of motivation does that\nbring to the rest of the environment?\n\n146\n00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.945\nThat is contagious.\n\n147\n00:06:47.945 --> 00:06:50.305\nPositive energy is very, very contagious.\n\n148\n00:06:50.305 --> 00:06:54.575\nAnd if we can bring more of that positive\nenergy into our team as entrepreneurs,\n\n149\n00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:58.095\nas leaders, as business leaders,\nwe can feed off that energy.\n\n150\n00:06:58.095 --> 00:07:02.025\nBecause I think we struggle all the time\nto constantly keep our team positive,\n\n151\n00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:05.715\nkeep our team motivated, keep our team\nexcited, because there's trivial times.\n\n152\n00:07:05.715 --> 00:07:09.425\nThere's times where we're trying to do\nsomething, and we keep hitting roadblocks,\n\n153\n00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:10.710\nwe keep hitting roadblocks.\n\n154\n00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.222\nAnd we might not accept it\nbecause we're entrepreneurs, but\n\n155\n00:07:14.222 --> 00:07:17.220\nwe gotta think about our team.\n\n156\n00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.060\nDo they get demotivated?\n\n157\n00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.700\nIs there an opportunity that you think our\nteam says, wow, maybe this doesn't work.\n\n158\n00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.070\nAnd maybe I want to quit on this, but\nmy leader keeps telling me to push it.\n\n159\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.450\nIf the leader's the only one,\nwhat happens to the team?\n\n160\n00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.670\nThe team may become\ndisconnected from the leader.\n\n161\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.380\nBut if you have millennials who\nrally behind the leader and\n\n162\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.890\nkeep pushing your concepts forward and\nsaying, team, don't get disillusioned.\n\n163\n00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.500\nYes we can!\n\n164\n00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.350\nAnd they bring up examples,\nlike, we got through 9/11.\n\n165\n00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.090\nWe got through the real estate bubble.\n\n166\n00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.140\nWe got through the stock market crash.\n\n167\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.790\nWe can do it.\n\n168\n00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.690\nThey will also find opportunities in\nyour company, where your company has\n\n169\n00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.920\nalso been able to push through the limits,\npush through the boundaries.\n\n170\n00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.480\nThey're gonna remember those times and\nbe able to use those stories\n\n171\n00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.710\nto remind your team and engage\nthe optimism back into your company.\n\n172\n00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think it's pretty easy to\nsee how company cultures have changed over\n\n173\n00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.820\nthe last 10 to 20 years as millennials\nhave started to enter workforce.\n\n174\n00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.030\nYou get from that stigma in your mind\nof people going to work unhappy,\n\n175\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.850\nand we gotta get here and\npunch the clock at 5:00, too.\n\n176\n00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.020\nWorkplaces are fun and\nexciting things now.\n\n177\n00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.170\nThere's ping pong tables, and all those\nkinds of things that people kind of make\n\n178\n00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.160\nfun of sometimes, but on the flip side,\nyou got people staying til 8, 9:00.\n\n179\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.400\nThey're coming in on the weekend.\n\n180\n00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.540\nAnd a happy employee is not just\ngonna put in those longer hours,\n\n181\n00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.315\nbut are gonna put in that extra\nbit of effort for the company.\n\n182\n00:08:38.315 --> 00:08:42.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, and that kind\nof positivity, it totally radiates.\n\n183\n00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:46.625\nAnd we can argue and talk about all\nday how it'll stay within your team.\n\n184\n00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:49.345\nBut the truth is that\nwhen your team is happy,\n\n185\n00:08:49.345 --> 00:08:53.797\nthat will radiate 10,000%\nthrough to your customers.\n\n186\n00:08:53.797 --> 00:08:58.337\nYour customers are going to start to see\nhow amazing not only your product is, but\n\n187\n00:08:58.337 --> 00:08:59.447\nhow amazing your team is.\n\n188\n00:08:59.447 --> 00:09:01.269\nHow excited your employees are.\n\n189\n00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:03.687\nHow excited your team members are.\n\n190\n00:09:03.687 --> 00:09:06.777\nAnd that will permeate throughout\nyour entire organization,\n\n191\n00:09:06.777 --> 00:09:08.187\nstraight through to your customers.\n\n192\n00:09:08.187 --> 00:09:11.847\nThat will permeate through to your\nsuppliers, through everybody that you do\n\n193\n00:09:11.847 --> 00:09:16.470\nbusiness with as an organization will\nstart to see the optimism in your team.\n\n194\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.050\nAnd I'm sure we've all been through it,\n\n195\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.390\nbut optimism is like a force,\nit's like a magnet.\n\n196\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.495\nPeople want to be around positive people.\n\n197\n00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:26.320\nIt's just natural instinct.\n\n198\n00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.880\nNobody likes being around negative Nancy.\n\n199\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.700\nNobody likes around Debbie Downer.\n\n200\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:35.050\nPeople want to be around positive people,\nand millennials are naturally optimistic.\n\n201\n00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:42.060\nMillennials, again, we can give words\nthat describe this generation and\n\n202\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.180\nlook at them positive or\nlook at them negative, right?!\n\n203\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.410\nPeople that I talk to,\n\n204\n00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.630\nsome business leaders, that say well,\nthey're actually very naive.\n\n205\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.420\nThey don't know what\nthey're talking about and\n\n206\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.270\nthey don't see that\nthere's a possible risk.\n\n207\n00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.985\n&gt;&gt; They're not jaded yet like I am.\n\n208\n00:09:54.985 --> 00:09:55.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n209\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.420\nWe're looking at it just the wrong way.\n\n210\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.320\nThis generation is optimistic.\n\n211\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.910\nYes, okay, they don't have the experience\nthat you may have the experience.\n\n212\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.560\nGreat, but they're not jaded, right?\n\n213\n00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.210\nThey're not, I call it tainted,\nwith the experience that we\n\n214\n00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.380\nmay have in the industry that we have, to\nsee the roadblock before it's even there.\n\n215\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.070\nAnd you know what?\n\n216\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.950\nThat road block may not even exist.\n\n217\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.410\nYes, I agree we should prepare for it.\n\n218\n00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.210\nBut at the same time, we shouldn't\nlet that roadblock deter us or\n\n219\n00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.290\nstop us from taking the first step.\n\n220\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.870\nWe've gotta start taking the steps\nto get through those things.\n\n221\n00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.630\nAnd millennials will give you\njust that amount of optimism and\n\n222\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.720\nmotivation to start taking the path.\n\n223\n00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.620\n&gt;&gt; And so our role as an employer or\n\n224\n00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.120\nas a coworker is to help\nmaintain that optimism with them.\n\n225\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.260\nAnd also to help that grow\nacross the entire company.\n\n226\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I definitely agree.\n\n227\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.960\nI mean, they will bring it in naturally.\n\n228\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:51.080\nThe culture will be conducive to it or\nthe culture may cause them to reject it.\n\n229\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.050\nEnough on happiness.\n\n230\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.570\nI mean we've seen it in so\nmany cases in so many companies.\n\n231\n00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.840\nYou're unhappy,\nyour team is gonna be unhappy,\n\n232\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.690\nthey're gonna quit, your customers are\ngonna be unhappy, they're gonna leave you.\n\n233\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.430\nI mean it's just terrible,\nterrible, terrible, situation.\n\n234\n00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.670\nSo we gotta leverage that.\n\n235\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.600\nMillennials are coming into our\ncompany and they're optimistic.\n\n236\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.190\nGreat.\n\n237\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.570\nLet's feed that through\nthe rest of the company, right?\n\n238\n00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:16.510\nYou should be exposing and really pulling\nout that optimism from your millennials so\n\n239\n00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.290\nit spreads throughout your entire team.\n\n240\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.255\nAnd that's really where\nwe leverage the power.\n\n241\n00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:23.760\nThat's where I've leveraged the power\nof millennials in my company,\n\n242\n00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.550\nall the companies that I've built.\n\n243\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.450\nMillennials are just constantly,\nconstantly like pushing, pushing, pushing.\n\n244\n00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.540\nYeah, we've hit walls.\n\n245\n00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.410\nYes, we failed in a couple things,\nbut so what?\n\n246\n00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.310\nWe tried.\n\n247\n00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.632\nAnd if it wasn't for\nthat optimism and that positivity,\n\n248\n00:11:35.632 --> 00:11:40.240\nI guarantee that little voice in the back\nof our heads would have said, hey,\n\n249\n00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.000\nmaybe you shouldn't take that risk.\n\n250\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.400\nMaybe you shouldn't try that.\n\n251\n00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.810\nAnd like the old adage goes,\nno risk no reward.\n\n252\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:53.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, any final thoughts on how we can\nmaintain that culture in our companies?\n\n253\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.540\n&gt;&gt; Maintaining the optimism and the\npositivity really stems from the leaders.\n\n254\n00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.630\nAnd I think it's very important\nthat the leaders, really,\n\n255\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:04.095\nwhen you gotta come into your workplace,\nregardless of what generation you're from,\n\n256\n00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:06.745\nwith a very optimistic and\npositive mindset.\n\n257\n00:12:06.745 --> 00:12:09.195\nAnd kind of create that culture.\n\n258\n00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:12.665\nMillennials, just like\nany other generation,\n\n259\n00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:14.595\nlooks up to the leaders of the company.\n\n260\n00:12:14.595 --> 00:12:16.565\nAnd if, as a leader, we're coming in and\n\n261\n00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:19.715\nwe're unhappy,\nwe go through things, I get it.\n\n262\n00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:20.455\nWe're stressed.\n\n263\n00:12:20.455 --> 00:12:21.735\nWe got financial troubles.\n\n264\n00:12:21.735 --> 00:12:23.520\nWe make bad decisions.\n\n265\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.340\nI get it.\n\n266\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.000\nBut there's a way to expose those\nthings in a positive way, right?\n\n267\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.170\nEverything that I go through, whether it's\ngood or bad, or whatever, I learn from it.\n\n268\n00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.460\nSo it's a positive experience for me.\n\n269\n00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.590\nI live my life in the way where everything\nI go through is a positive experience, and\n\n270\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.820\nI try to find it in a very positive way.\n\n271\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:40.850\nAnd I take something and I learn.\n\n272\n00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:41.690\nSo I never lose.\n\n273\n00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.100\nI always learn no matter what.\n\n274\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.560\nAnd that's the kind of thing that I\nthink we need our leaders from today,\n\n275\n00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.100\nin organizations,\nto really embed that into our team, and\n\n276\n00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:54.160\nuse millennials as a force that will bring\nthat positivity in your organization,\n\n277\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.720\nif your organization is lacking that.\n\n278\n00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.870\n&gt;&gt; That's a great mantra,\n\n279\n00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.460\nand I think something that\neverybody can use a little bit of.\n\n280\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.790\nAnd so if you're a millennial,\nyeah, keep that up.\n\n281\n00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.860\nAnd if you're not,\n\n282\n00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.090\ntry to catch that infectious\noptimism from these millennials.\n\n283\n00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.300\nBut I think that's gonna do it for\nthis episode.\n\n284\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.630\nWe got a lot more great content to get\nto on working with millennials and\n\n285\n00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.830\nunderstanding them.\n\n286\n00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.680\nBut for now, signing off,\nI'm your host, Peter VanRysdam.\n\n287\n00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Javier Montes,\nyour millennial expert.\n\n288\n00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.212\nWe'll see you at the next

I am, so what is the exciting topic?\n\n18\n00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.540\n&gt;&gt; This topic is called\nexperiences versus possessions.\n\n19\n00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.890\nThis is very very very important.\n\n20\n00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.190\nNow why is this important?\n\n21\n00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.850\nSo, we got to understand\nthat Millennials define\n\n22\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.910\nsuccess in a very different way than\nprevious generations define success.\n\n23\n00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.980\nSo let's start off with\nprevious generations, and\n\n24\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.120\nprevious generations define success\nby the amount of possessions or\n\n25\n00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.730\nmaterial things that they\nacquire throughout their lives.\n\n26\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.370\nSo a Gen-xer or a Baby Boomer would say\nthat they were more successful when they\n\n27\n00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.680\nacquired a house, a nicer car,\nbetter clothes, you know, nicer watches.\n\n28\n00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.720\nYu know, things like that would be how\na GenXer would possibly define success.\n\n29\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.670\nSo if two people were in a room,\ntwo Genexers,\n\n30\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.070\none person drove a nicer car, that person\nwould be considered more successful.\n\n31\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.950\nAnd that's how, you know,\n\n32\n00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.780\nthat was the mindset because that's how\nthe previous generations define success.\n\n33\n00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.390\nNow let's transfer over to Millennials.\n\n34\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.650\nNow Millennials define success very,\nvery differently.\n\n35\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.770\nMillennials define\nsuccess by the amount of\n\n36\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.340\nexperiences that they can\nacquire throughout their lives.\n\n37\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.340\nNow why is that?\n\n38\n00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.780\nLet's talk about why first and\n\n39\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.120\nthen let's talk about how we're\ngoing to use it in our company.\n\n40\n00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.320\nSo why did this happen?\n\n41\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.480\nMillennials value experiences more than\npossessions because of one major thing.\n\n42\n00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.964\nThroughout their lives a lot of\nmillennials watched their parents work for\n\n43\n00:02:16.964 --> 00:02:21.604\na company for many, many, years,\ntypically you know, 20 or 30 years.\n\n44\n00:02:21.604 --> 00:02:24.697\nAs they were growing up, they watched\ntheir parents you know, day in,\n\n45\n00:02:24.697 --> 00:02:29.190\nday out you know, really blood, sweat,\nand tears, and work for this company.\n\n46\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.970\nSometimes, not sometimes, I mean,\nafter awhile a lot of millennials\n\n47\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.390\nexperience that their parents may have\ngotten laid off because of down sizing.\n\n48\n00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.354\nThey may have experienced the real estate\nbubble, the stock market crash, 9/11, and\n\n49\n00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:49.530\na series of other events that caused their\nparents to become in financial struggle.\n\n50\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.380\nPossibly lose their houses to foreclosure,\npossibly have their cars repossessed,\n\n51\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.760\nhaving to get rid of some of\ntheir investment properties.\n\n52\n00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.240\nAnd possibly some of the material\nthings which they had acquired\n\n53\n00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.771\nall of a sudden had to be liquidated.\n\n54\n00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:07.245\nTherefore this caused millennial to think\nin the back of their minds as they watch\n\n55\n00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:11.945\nthis happen that these things that their\nparents worked so hard to acquire were\n\n56\n00:03:11.945 --> 00:03:17.235\nall of a sudden, one day just taken away\nfrom them through no fault of their own.\n\n57\n00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:18.685\nSo something that they\nwatch their parents,\n\n58\n00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:20.695\nsay wait a second my parents worked so\nhard.\n\n59\n00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:24.040\nThey finally rewarded themselves with\nthese things and all of a sudden,\n\n60\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.820\nsomething happened in the world that\nmy parents didn't necessarily do and\n\n61\n00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.240\nthese things were all\nof a sudden taken away.\n\n62\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.810\n&gt;&gt; And I think even if they didn't go\nthrough that bankruptcy or a layoff,\n\n63\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.940\nthey might notice that even though my\nparents have this house they bought,\n\n64\n00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.400\neven though they have the nice Cadillac\nin the driveway maybe they're not happy.\n\n65\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.531\nMaybe they went through a divorce,\nmaybe there is other things like that.\n\n66\n00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:49.080\nThey can kind of see that these things\nthat my parents thought were the things\n\n67\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.465\nthat they were working for\nand they really wanted,\n\n68\n00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:54.584\nmaybe at the end of the day they're\nnot what's making them happy.\n\n69\n00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:57.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so that's a great point.\n\n70\n00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.690\nBut also what happened was that they\nsaw that these things were taken away,\n\n71\n00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.870\nand therefore millennials all of a sudden\nsaid these things are not valuable to me.\n\n72\n00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.010\nThey were valuable to my parents.\n\n73\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.420\nBut if somebody or some scenario in life\ncauses them to be taken away from them,\n\n74\n00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.990\nthey have zero value.\n\n75\n00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.500\nThey're really unvaluable.\n\n76\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.830\nSo millennials learn to think, well,\n\n77\n00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.870\nthe things that they can't take away from\nme are the experiences that I acquire.\n\n78\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.490\nAs I live my life and I go on a vacation,\nor I have a nice memory with my family, or\n\n79\n00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.650\nwe go backpacking, or\nwe experience a new restaurant,\n\n80\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.530\nor we experience something in\nthe workplace with a bunch of our friends.\n\n81\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.270\nThey learned that nobody can\never take that away from them.\n\n82\n00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.420\nAnd they said,\nthat is the definition of success for us.\n\n83\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.690\nSo therefore, it's acquiring more moments\nlike that, wow we would define success.\n\n84\n00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.420\nSo, let's go and put this in the workplace\nand how this is relevant and\n\n85\n00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.390\nhow do we use this in\nour organizations today.\n\n86\n00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think this sounds like\nit's a great opportunity for\n\n87\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.436\nan employer that they no longer\nhave to really pay you right?\n\n88\n00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:04.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it;'s not necessarily\nthat we don't have to pay them, but\n\n89\n00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.560\nlet's think about what is the driving\nfactor, the motivating factor for\n\n90\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.280\na millennial when they come on\nboard to work for our company?\n\n91\n00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.180\nThe disconnect happens that\nmost of us that are working\n\n92\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.780\nto build our businesses are Gen-Xers or\nBaby Boomers.\n\n93\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.000\nWe understand that the most valuable\nthing really is the pay, is the money.\n\n94\n00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.050\nBecause again, we're trained and\n\n95\n00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.030\nwe were born in a world where\nmaterial things define success.\n\n96\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.110\nSo when we want to attract new\ntalent to our company and it happens\n\n97\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.290\nto be a millennial, our first instinct\nis well let's throw them more money.\n\n98\n00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.280\nLet's give them a higher salary.\n\n99\n00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.280\nLet's do something that\nentices them to come here.\n\n100\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.010\nWell there couldn't be a bigger disconnect\nwhen we try to do that because again\n\n101\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.830\nyou're trying to give somebody\nsomething that they don't really value.\n\n102\n00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.489\nWhen we have a millennial and\n\n103\n00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:55.065\nthe millennial is possibly\nconsidering leaving or quitting or\n\n104\n00:05:55.065 --> 00:05:58.917\nsays this is not working out for\nus, our natural instinct is to say.\n\n105\n00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:01.926\nWell wait but I'll give you more money\nbecause I think you're valuable or\n\n106\n00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:05.190\nwait I'll give you a bigger bonus or\nI'll give you this raise.\n\n107\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.120\nThings like that we start and\nwe couldn't create a bigger disconnect\n\n108\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.630\nwith our millennial team by\ndoing something like that.\n\n109\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.580\n&gt;&gt; Because those are things that we as\na boss see as valuable and so we're\n\n110\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.590\nassuming that that's what everyone else-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's what we're assuming,\n\n111\n00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.120\nbecause that's naturally\nhow we would be motivated.\n\n112\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.400\nNow, what does a Millennial really want?\n\n113\n00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.780\nThe Millennials value in the experiences.\n\n114\n00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.975\nSo how do we give experiences in\nour company to the Millennials?\n\n115\n00:06:29.975 --> 00:06:32.712\nHow do we attract them and\nhow do we retain them, and\n\n116\n00:06:32.712 --> 00:06:36.300\nhow do we keep them happier\nby giving them experiences?\n\n117\n00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.228\nTwo ways, the first way is we need to\nunderstand that working at our company is\n\n118\n00:06:39.228 --> 00:06:40.870\nan experience in itself.\n\n119\n00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.320\nSo what experience are we giving our\nMillennials as members of our company?\n\n120\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.860\nWhat experience are they having?\n\n121\n00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.820\nAre we developing them as leaders?\n\n122\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.380\nAre we developing their skills?\n\n123\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.390\nAre we having a fun work environment?\n\n124\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.060\nIs this experience of being\nan employee in our company\n\n125\n00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.510\nactually something that they are enjoying?\n\n126\n00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.170\nOr, is it more of something that's kind\nof a pain and they don't like to do that?\n\n127\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.710\n&gt;&gt; And so that could be the day\nto day coming to work and\n\n128\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.950\nhaving fun and\ngetting to work with your friends.\n\n129\n00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.650\nBut that could also be getting\nto be a part of something cool.\n\n130\n00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.840\nLike, could you imagine being,\n\n131\n00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.730\nhaving the experience of saying I got to\nwork on the first iteration of Facebook,\n\n132\n00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.050\nor I got to build this great app\nthat everyone is using today.\n\n133\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.414\nSo that pride in your work and getting\nbehind what you're actually creating could\n\n134\n00:07:23.414 --> 00:07:23.946\nbe-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n135\n00:07:23.946 --> 00:07:26.310\n&gt;&gt; That's the rewarding experience in and\nof itself.\n\n136\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.372\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that itself is a great experience\nand Millenials are constantly looking for\n\n137\n00:07:29.372 --> 00:07:30.190\nthat, right?\n\n138\n00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.980\nSo, what else can we do?\n\n139\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.950\nThe second part of it is what type of\nculture and environment have you created\n\n140\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.550\nthat allows your team members,\nspecifically your Millennials to enjoy\n\n141\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.990\ntheir life and have other experiences\noutside of working at your company?\n\n142\n00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.400\nSo in other words how strict\nare your office hours,\n\n143\n00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.770\nhow strict are your vacation policies,\nhow strict are your sick policies?\n\n144\n00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.280\nDo you allow your team to\nwork from home on days\n\n145\n00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.800\nwhen they may have a situation arise or\nare you very strict on that?\n\n146\n00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.840\nThat is how you allow them to have\nexperiences outside of the company.\n\n147\n00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.900\nSo in two ways, that's ways which\nmillenials value those experiences, right?\n\n148\n00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.700\nSo instead of offering them more money,\n\n149\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.910\nif we understand that they are more\ndriven by the experiences.\n\n150\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.420\nWell, let's get to the root of why\nyou don't want to work here anymore.\n\n151\n00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.100\nWhat's the struggle that you're going,\nwell,\n\n152\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.090\nit's really because I want to go to\nschool and time doesn't allow it.\n\n153\n00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.660\nGreat, let's shift you to a position where\nyou have school in the morning, you have\n\n154\n00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.820\nschool at night, and you can work remotely\nfrom university for a couple of hours.\n\n155\n00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.457\nGreat, that is an example of allowing\nthem to have the experience that they\n\n156\n00:08:36.457 --> 00:08:39.748\nwanna have outside of work,\nbeing flexible on your work policies,\n\n157\n00:08:39.748 --> 00:08:43.757\nand still allowing them to have a great\nexperience while working at your company.\n\n158\n00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:48.514\n&gt;&gt; And I've heard of a lot of instances\nof, rather than people just saying,\n\n159\n00:08:48.514 --> 00:08:50.840\nI work from home, I telecommute.\n\n160\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.040\nMeaning I can go live in Costa Rica for\ntwo months and I can work on the beach.\n\n161\n00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.350\nAnd then, in two months, I can go and I\ncan be in Europe and I can be backpacking,\n\n162\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.660\nbut I'm still working.\n\n163\n00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.040\nAnd so telecommuting doesn't just\nmean working from home anymore.\n\n164\n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.220\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah, I mean we need to,\nthe world is changing, right Peter?\n\n165\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:08.720\nThat's the truth.\n\n166\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.976\nThe world is changing, and\nI think that there's thought leaders,\n\n167\n00:09:12.976 --> 00:09:15.815\nlike Tim Ferriss and\nthe four hour work week,\n\n168\n00:09:15.815 --> 00:09:19.714\nwill start teaching us that there\nis other ways to do our work.\n\n169\n00:09:19.714 --> 00:09:21.573\nWe'll talk a little bit more\nabout this in another video.\n\n170\n00:09:21.573 --> 00:09:26.351\nBut we need to really focus our attention\nas businesses and entrepreneurs not so\n\n171\n00:09:26.351 --> 00:09:30.680\nmuch on the hours worked but\nmore on the results produced, right?\n\n172\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.030\nCuz at the end of the day,\nthat's what we want anyways.\n\n173\n00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.230\nRight, we were just raised in a time\nwhere, if they're at the office,\n\n174\n00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.650\nwe assume that they're working.\n\n175\n00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.360\nSo therefore,\nproductivity is defined by hours worked.\n\n176\n00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.030\nWell that's not the truth.\n\n177\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.610\nThe truth is, the results given is\nwhat really determines productivity.\n\n178\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we talked earlier in another\nepisode about defining success and\n\n179\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.620\nsaying, here's what we expect from you so\nwe can see how you're doing.\n\n180\n00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.960\nSo basically where success\n40 years ago might have been\n\n181\n00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.180\nsuccess means that you clocked in at 8AM\nand that you clocked out at 5 o'clock and\n\n182\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.820\nthat you took 30 minutes for lunch.\n\n183\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.090\nSuccess today might mean you\nfixed this bug in this code and\n\n184\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.870\nyou got our app back online today.\n\n185\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.030\nOr you got this report done\nthat we needed to get done,\n\n186\n00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.750\nso it's not necessarily\njust about hours and money.\n\n187\n00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.930\nIt's about-\n&gt;&gt; It's\n\n188\n00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.810\nexactly not about hours anymore, right?\n\n189\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.100\nIt's about results.\n\n190\n00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.437\nAnd at the end of the day as [INAUDIBLE]\nsaid that's what we care about,\n\n191\n00:10:27.437 --> 00:10:28.541\nwe care about results, right?\n\n192\n00:10:28.541 --> 00:10:31.456\nAnd if our team can get their\nwork done more efficiently or\n\n193\n00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:34.165\nfaster then we should\npromote that type of culture.\n\n194\n00:10:34.165 --> 00:10:38.000\nBut sticking to the experiences versus\npossessions all right we need to really\n\n195\n00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.550\nthink about, and,\nlook at our culture and say,\n\n196\n00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.510\nwhat experience are we\ngiving to these Millenials?\n\n197\n00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.520\nI will tell you,\ndoing this stuff just for Millenials and\n\n198\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.200\nenforcing these policies, and being\na little flexible, and revisiting them\n\n199\n00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.251\nwill also have a very positive effect\non your non-Millenials as well.\n\n200\n00:10:54.251 --> 00:10:56.211\nYour non-Millenials, your gen-Xers,\n\n201\n00:10:56.211 --> 00:11:01.190\nyour baby boomers, will also really enjoy\nthat your culture is promoting that they\n\n202\n00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.520\ncan have a better experience not\nonly at work but outside of work.\n\n203\n00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.987\nSo experiences is a very valuable\nthing and I think more and\n\n204\n00:11:07.987 --> 00:11:11.332\nmore as our world is developing and\nas we're becoming.\n\n205\n00:11:11.332 --> 00:11:14.148\nYou're hearing about all\nthis talk about stress and\n\n206\n00:11:14.148 --> 00:11:18.451\nwork-life balance and this is becoming\na very hot topic right now in the media.\n\n207\n00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:21.679\nIf we focus on that,\nthen we would understand that really,\n\n208\n00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:25.080\neverybody's starting to value\nexperiences a lot more.\n\n209\n00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.620\n&gt;&gt; And it makes a lot of sense because if\nyou think about the example from earlier,\n\n210\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.780\nif things go sour, and there's bankruptcy.\n\n211\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.560\nThe experiences that can't be taken\naway from you, the other stuff can.\n\n212\n00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.700\nSo I think that's a great\npoint to keep in mind.\n\n213\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.040\nAny final thoughts on\nexperiences versus possessions?\n\n214\n00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.479\n&gt;&gt; No, I think we had a comment here.\n\n215\n00:11:40.479 --> 00:11:43.451\nLet's see, Keith says they're highly\noverpaid for what they do, and I read\n\n216\n00:11:43.451 --> 00:11:47.260\na study that they were almost two times-\n&gt;&gt; Keith was saying that credit card debt\n\n217\n00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.299\nand things like that are also something\nthat people were saddled with over a long\n\n218\n00:11:51.299 --> 00:11:52.218\nperiods of time.\n\n219\n00:11:52.218 --> 00:11:56.186\nAnd if you're not going out and\nbuying a house, if you're just renting,\n\n220\n00:11:56.186 --> 00:12:00.359\nif you're not getting the fancy car,\nyou're able to put yourself in a debt.\n\n221\n00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:03.367\nWhich a lot of Millenials are already in\ndebt with the student loans that they\n\n222\n00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:05.670\ndon't need to be getting into\ncredit card debt as well so.\n\n223\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean they are starting off\nwith that and the value of experiences,\n\n224\n00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.750\nI say this all the time in a lot of\nmy talks that I give to our groups\n\n225\n00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.720\n&gt;&gt; Is, the truth is in the pudding, right?\n\n226\n00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.360\nAnd if you don't believe me\nabout this experience stuff just\n\n227\n00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.740\nopen up any social media outlet you want.\n\n228\n00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.820\nPick it, a Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,\n\n229\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.320\nSnapChat, whatever it is you want,\nopen up any one you want.\n\n230\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.060\nAll you will see is pictures\nof people's foods so\n\n231\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.800\nthey can say look at the food\nthat I'm experiencing.\n\n232\n00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.900\nLook at the restaurant that I'm\nexperiencing, look how amazing it is.\n\n233\n00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.540\nYou're gonna see selfies, right?\n\n234\n00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nlook at this cool environment I'm at.\n\n235\n00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.170\n&gt;&gt; Look where I'm at, right?\n\n236\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.510\nThey don't flaunt look at this\nbeautiful big new ring I got,\n\n237\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.820\nlook at this new car that I got,\nlook at this house that I got, right?\n\n238\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.250\nThey want to flaunt the experience of what\nthey are doing, the places they are going,\n\n239\n00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.430\nthe places they are eating.\n\n240\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.320\nThis is what this generation is really,\nreally valuing and\n\n241\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.610\nif we can tap into that and understand\nthat is what is important to them.\n\n242\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:04.155\nThen we can totally use it to attract\ntop talent into our organization,\n\n243\n00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:06.645\nto retain the talent that we already have.\n\n244\n00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:10.185\nSo we need to know and understand\nthis is what's valuable to them.\n\n245\n00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:13.615\nAnd even though we see something else as\nvaluable and we're chasing something,\n\n246\n00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:16.172\nwe've got to understand that there's\na possibility that somebody else\n\n247\n00:13:16.172 --> 00:13:17.512\ncan value something else.\n\n248\n00:13:17.512 --> 00:13:21.252\nA working mom would value being\nable to go watch her kids play.\n\n249\n00:13:22.722 --> 00:13:27.362\nA young mom who is pregnant or\nabout to have a child or just\n\n250\n00:13:27.362 --> 00:13:32.170\nhad a recent new born would appreciate\nmore time to be with their children.\n\n251\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.780\nSo much and so many companies\nfrom previous generations and\n\n252\n00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.220\neven big corporate America are so\nstrict on their time off policies.\n\n253\n00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:45.057\nAre so strict on their maternity\nleave policies, right?\n\n254\n00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:47.130\nYou're gonna completely\ndisconnect this generation.\n\n255\n00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.670\nAnd again, if we can understand,\nit's not about the money.\n\n256\n00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.540\nIt's not just about well, you're\ngetting time off, and I'll pay you for\n\n257\n00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.240\nthat time off.\n\n258\n00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.740\nWell think about the experience.\n\n259\n00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.950\nMaybe they don't want more time off.\n\n260\n00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.700\nMaybe they don't want more money.\n\n261\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.520\nThey want more time with their kids.\n\n262\n00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.025\nThey want to hear that you're flexible\nwhen they have a kid's play that you can\n\n263\n00:14:03.025 --> 00:14:07.105\nactually go out without feeling like,\nI have to ask my boss for a favor.\n\n264\n00:14:07.105 --> 00:14:10.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and when we know it's\nabout money for the company but\n\n265\n00:14:10.345 --> 00:14:13.675\nby keeping your employees happy,\nthat's gonna help your profitability and\n\n266\n00:14:13.675 --> 00:14:15.145\nhelp the company have a lot.\n\n267\n00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:18.475\nWell I think that's a great place to go\nahead and leave off for this episode.\n\n268\n00:14:18.475 --> 00:14:20.365\nI know we've got a lot\nmore content to get to.\n\n269\n00:14:20.365 --> 00:14:22.005\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; That was some great stuff but\n\n270\n00:14:22.005 --> 00:14:23.160\nsigning off.\n\n271\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.490\nI'm Peter VanRysdam.\n\n272\n00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.530\n&gt;&gt;

Yes, definitely, Definitely much so.\n\n162\n00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.660\nRight, you know, they align with Amazon\nbecause Amazon is Is revolutionizing\n\n163\n00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.260\nthe way that we're delivering or buying\nproducts, and then motivated by that.\n\n164\n00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.270\nThey have a clear alignment to say,\nyou know what, I wanna be a part of that.\n\n165\n00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:15.270\nI think that I want people to have access\nto more products in a larger scale.\n\n166\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.470\nLike just because I lived in a city\nthat maybe my population is small or\n\n167\n00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.620\nI don't have big chains of big stores.\n\n168\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.570\ndoesn't mean that I can't have access\nto some of the great things in the big\n\n169\n00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.710\ncities, right?\n\n170\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.850\nThey believe in those things.\n\n171\n00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.400\n&gt;&gt; So is it fair to say then that\na millennial might do better at a smaller\n\n172\n00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.780\ncompany where, unlike a big business that\nhas a lot of bureaucracy, where they feel\n\n173\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.310\nlike they can actually make a change and\nimplement their own ideas?\n\n174\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's exactly right.\n\n175\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.770\nRight.\nAnd I say entrepreneurism, and\n\n176\n00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.700\nI say this entrepreneurial mindset\nSize is subjective, right?\n\n177\n00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.430\nSo we can say a smaller company.\n\n178\n00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.500\nIt doesn't necessarily need to\nbe a smaller company as long as\n\n179\n00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.930\nthe entrepreneurs, the startup mindset.\n\n180\n00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.520\nThat kind of culture is\nstill in your organization,\n\n181\n00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.130\nthat is the type of team that\nthey wanna be a part of.\n\n182\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.930\nThey do not necessarily wanna be a part\nof big corporate America with a lot of\n\n183\n00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.960\nbureaucracy with glass ceilings,\nwith Traditional management styles where\n\n184\n00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.170\nthey're holding people down, they don't\nwanna be part of that kind of culture.\n\n185\n00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.080\nSo therefore,\nif we know that as a small business,\n\n186\n00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.920\nas a growing business, and entrepreneurs\nas business leaders, we can revolutionize\n\n187\n00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.570\nthe way that our company is being run And\nwe can actually capitalize on the best\n\n188\n00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.480\ntalent of this generation by reigniting\nthat startup culture in our business.\n\n189\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.750\nIt doesn't matter if your business\nhas been around for 10 years.\n\n190\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.500\nBut if your business is currently,\nif you're looking at your goals for\n\n191\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.660\nthis year and your goals say, well,\nwe're gonna grow 2% this year?\n\n192\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.390\nMillenials will come in and\nchallenge that.\n\n193\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.180\nAnd if you change that culture to say,\nokay, well, why can't we do 100% growth?\n\n194\n00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.290\nWell, because we've never done it that and\nwe have our processes.\n\n195\n00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.150\nYou buy into those things, that's not\nthe culture they wanna be a part of.\n\n196\n00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.210\nBut if you allow them to challenge it and\nsay, well,\n\n197\n00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.140\nwhat do we need to do to\nexperience 100% growth?\n\n198\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.320\nWe haven't done it in the last five years,\nthat's no problem.\n\n199\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.680\nBut what can we do?\n\n200\n00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.620\nWhat can we change in our business right?\n\n201\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.460\nThat culture will totally\nattract the millennial.\n\n202\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.590\nAnd that is how we will compete as small\nbusinesses with big corporate America.\n\n203\n00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.035\nThe talent wants to come to us but\nWe haven't set up the structure.\n\n204\n00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:18.955\nWe haven't set up the environment for\nthem to actually feel safe and\n\n205\n00:10:18.955 --> 00:10:21.375\ncomfortable in our small businesses today.\n\n206\n00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:22.875\nSo this is the time.\n\n207\n00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:25.345\nThis generation wants to be a part\nof small businesses in America.\n\n208\n00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:27.937\nThey want to be part of\nentrepreneurial America.\n\n209\n00:10:27.937 --> 00:10:31.117\nBut most organizations haven't\ncreated that culture yet, and\n\n210\n00:10:31.117 --> 00:10:34.507\nif you do create that culture,\nthey will come running through your doors.\n\n211\n00:10:34.507 --> 00:10:37.487\n&gt;&gt; I'm definitely seeing a theme\ntoday that, the entrepreneur,\n\n212\n00:10:37.487 --> 00:10:40.838\nthe definition of that for a millennial\nis different, than it is for the others\n\n213\n00:10:40.838 --> 00:10:41.368\n&gt;&gt; There's generation.\n\n214\n00:10:41.368 --> 00:10:44.498\nThe same thing with how we've just\ndefine success in earlier episodes and\n\n215\n00:10:44.498 --> 00:10:46.098\nI think that's really good to the kids.\n\n216\n00:10:46.098 --> 00:10:49.018\nWhat we're doing in this show is not\nsaying here's how you can change\n\n217\n00:10:49.018 --> 00:10:52.628\nthe millenials to make them fit into\nyour ways of doing things better rather\n\n218\n00:10:52.628 --> 00:10:55.648\nhere's how you can understand them\nto get the most out of them and\n\n219\n00:10:55.648 --> 00:10:59.078\nsee things like an entrepreneur in\nyour workplace, not as a red or\n\n220\n00:10:59.078 --> 00:11:02.678\npotential flag risk but\nas an asset and something you can\n\n221\n00:11:02.678 --> 00:11:07.190\nreally take a hold off and run with but\n&gt;&gt; Any final thoughts on this topic?\n\n222\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.950\n&gt;&gt; I think it's pretty much head,\n\n223\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.130\njust understanding that this is the right\ntime, this won't last forever, right?\n\n224\n00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.360\nAnd right now again there's a lot of\npeople who understood that there's so\n\n225\n00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.950\nmuch power in having\nmillennials on your team and.\n\n226\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.040\nAnd they wanna capitalize on that, and\n\n227\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.100\nthis is the time to really\ncapitalize on that.\n\n228\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.250\nThis is the time to bring\nthis generation on board,\n\n229\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.940\nbecause they want to be part of\nour entrepreneurial companies.\n\n230\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.590\nThey wanna be part of this culture, they\nwanna be part of this fast growing team\n\n231\n00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.120\nthat's energetic, pumped up, optimistic\nand ready to take on the world and\n\n232\n00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.130\nhave an impact on the world\nthat they live in.\n\n233\n00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.930\nAnd.\n\n234\n00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.200\nIf you can understand that and\n\n235\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.580\nyou're willing to take the changes\nneeded to attract this generation,\n\n236\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.050\nthen you're gonna have an amazing\nexperience with millennials.\n\n237\n00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.170\nAnd this is the time cuz\n\n238\n00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.790\nright now millennials consider\nentrepreneurism is sexy.\n\n239\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.570\n&gt;&gt;

Peter VanRysdam, and today,\nwe're continuing in our series about\n\n4\n00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:11.550\nunderstanding and\nworking with millennials.\n\n5\n00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.420\nAnd here to help us do that,\nwe have an expert on the topic.\n\n6\n00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.010\nIn fact, he's written the book on it,\nMillennial Workforce, Javier Montes.\n\n7\n00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.960\nJavier, how are you doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.124\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Peter.\n\n9\n00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:21.296\nI'm glad to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:23.620\nReady to talk with you one more time.\n\n11\n00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.640\nWe're gonna talk all about\nMillennial Workforce.\n\n12\n00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.430\nWe're gonna talk about your team,\nabout Millennials, and really,\n\n13\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.120\nwhat makes them tick.\n\n14\n00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.910\nAnd how they reason and\n\n15\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.430\nwhat made them come to this understanding\nand what justifies their way of thinking.\n\n16\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.678\nSo, today, we're gonna talk\nabout a really cool topic.\n\n17\n00:00:40.678 --> 00:00:43.684\nThe top personal and\nwork-life intertwined.\n\n18\n00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:47.062\nAnd we're gonna talk all about this and\nI've really deep into it, so\n\n19\n00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:51.099\nthat you can get a very deep understanding\nof what shape this millennial mindset.\n\n20\n00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:54.072\n&gt;&gt; And I know we've talked, there's\na little bit in some previous episodes.\n\n21\n00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:57.660\nAnd if you haven't checked those out yet,\nbe sure to go back and do that.\n\n22\n00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.510\nWatch those as well.\n\n23\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.367\nBut we talked about what millennials\nvalue and less so money and\n\n24\n00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:04.856\nmore so on those personal experiences.\n\n25\n00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:08.546\nSo, finding that work-life balance\nis really important for millennials.\n\n26\n00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:13.332\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's actually [LAUGH] a little\nbit different than when we started.\n\n27\n00:01:13.332 --> 00:01:15.370\nSo, then,\nwhat we've been talking about with\n\n28\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.840\nprevious generations when it comes to\nbalancing this personal work-life.\n\n29\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.850\nSo, let's put this into\ncontext real quick and\n\n30\n00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.580\nlet's talk about our previous generations.\n\n31\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.710\nMy parents were Gen X parents, and\n\n32\n00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.970\nI was raised in a very traditional\nhousehold with traditional values,\n\n33\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.038\nthat's supposedly have said to have been\nlost within the millennial generation.\n\n34\n00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:38.495\nAnd the mindset, what I was always taught,\n\n35\n00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:43.354\nwhich a lot of Gen Xers were\nalways taught from their parents,\n\n36\n00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:48.598\nwas work and personal life are two\nvery different things, right?\n\n37\n00:01:48.598 --> 00:01:51.560\nAnd you don't mix your work with\nyour family or your friends.\n\n38\n00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.410\nYour personal life stays at home and\nyour business life stays at work.\n\n39\n00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.900\nAnd those two things,\nthose worlds cannot mix.\n\n40\n00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.083\nThat's the way I was raised, that's the\nway that previous generations were raised,\n\n41\n00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:01.790\nand that's fine.\n\n42\n00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.310\nWe accepted it just as that.\n\n43\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.010\nHowever, now come millennials\ninto the world and\n\n44\n00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.530\nall of a sudden, millennials say,\nyou know what, I don't like that idea.\n\n45\n00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.933\nI reject that idea, actually,\nand I want my personal life and\n\n46\n00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:18.482\nmy work life to be very much in sync.\n\n47\n00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:19.805\nI want them to be together.\n\n48\n00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.976\nI want them to be intertwined.\n\n49\n00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:25.489\nI want my personal life and\nmy work life to be almost one thing,\n\n50\n00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.783\nif not the same thing.\n\n51\n00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:28.722\nNow, what is that?\n\n52\n00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:30.417\nNow, why would they want that?\n\n53\n00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:37.278\nSo, I think that millennials, this mindset\ncame from when they were in school.\n\n54\n00:02:37.278 --> 00:02:39.269\nEver since they were in grade school,\n\n55\n00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.390\nmillennials were always taught\nto work on group projects.\n\n56\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.040\nI think that's one of those\nthings that became very popular.\n\n57\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.950\nAll throughout their life,\n\n58\n00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.710\never since they were small, group\nprojects in school became very popular.\n\n59\n00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.870\nAnd that went all the way through high\nschool, went all the way through college.\n\n60\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.320\nAnd throughout all these\nyears in schooling,\n\n61\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.520\nthey were taught that you\nneed to work as a group.\n\n62\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.930\nYou need to work as a team and figure out\nhow to work together because when you get\n\n63\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.580\nto the workplace,\nyou're gonna have to work in teams.\n\n64\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.400\nAnd I think Millennials developed\na very strong relationship\n\n65\n00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.510\nwith some of their friends.\n\n66\n00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.414\nAnd when you do group projects,\nyou tend to hang out at your houses, or\n\n67\n00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:14.829\nyou start going over each other's houses,\nor you start meeting up at libraries.\n\n68\n00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.210\nAnd you start doing these things\nreally disconnects you from the school\n\n69\n00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.140\nside, right?\n\n70\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.810\nAnd school be equivalent\nto work during these years.\n\n71\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.170\nAnd then, outside, meaning my house, or\n\n72\n00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.580\nthe coffee shop is outside of work or\nschool.\n\n73\n00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.540\nBut through these group projects,\nthey started to develop\n\n74\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.960\nthese relationships that these\ntwo became kind of one thing.\n\n75\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.220\nSo, they're in this world of\nschool projects for so many years.\n\n76\n00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.475\nAnd all of a sudden,\nthey go into the workforce and\n\n77\n00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:42.313\ntheir working with their peers in work.\n\n78\n00:03:42.313 --> 00:03:48.420\nAnd then, all of a sudden, they're being\ntold, no, don't meet up outside of work.\n\n79\n00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.040\nAll right, don't do the stuff that\nyou've done for so many years.\n\n80\n00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.000\nSo, Millennials say, wait,\nthat doesn't make any sense.\n\n81\n00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.270\nI've been doing this, it just makes sense.\n\n82\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.780\nSo, they naturally will say,\n\n83\n00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.780\nwell, let's go work on this project at\nthe coffee shop like we've done before.\n\n84\n00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.180\nLet's go to the library.\n\n85\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.250\nCome to my house and\nwe'll work on this project together.\n\n86\n00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.830\nAnd that just became natural to them.\n\n87\n00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.770\nUnfortunately, like I said,\n\n88\n00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.160\nprevious generations didn't\nreally accept this idea.\n\n89\n00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.960\nPrevious generations had a very\nclear distinction between these two.\n\n90\n00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.230\nSo, that's a little bit of the disconnect,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.680\nBecause what happens is millennials\nare coming into our companies.\n\n92\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.760\nMillennials are coming into our teams.\n\n93\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.780\nAnd they are starting to say, hey,\nwhy don't we go do something off site?\n\n94\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.820\nHey, why don't we,\nyou guys want to go to lunch with me?\n\n95\n00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.128\nHey, what are you doing after hours?\n\n96\n00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:33.310\nWhat are you doing this weekend?\n\n97\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.370\nAnd the gen Xers are looking\nat them like I'm busy.\n\n98\n00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.440\nOr No, I can't or whatnot.\n\n99\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.520\nSo it's creating a little bit of a\ndisconnect in-between the two generations.\n\n100\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.580\nSo Millennials want to have this bond,\nbut Gen Xers were taught, no,\n\n101\n00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.970\ndon't have this bond,\nyou don't mix those two worlds.\n\n102\n00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.430\nSo there's been a little\nbit of a disconnect.\n\n103\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.840\nAnd the Millennials are saying,\nbut why not?\n\n104\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.960\nSo it really comes from the leadership,\nfrom the top.\n\n105\n00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.610\nAnd what I found in my company and\nin the companies that I've worked with\n\n106\n00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.030\nThe best organizations that have the best\ncultures are allowing the team or\n\n107\n00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.000\nare creating opportunities for\nyour team to bond on a personal level.\n\n108\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.550\nNow what does that mean?\n\n109\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.505\nNow that means organizing Company lunches,\nor luncheons,\n\n110\n00:05:15.505 --> 00:05:18.445\nor pot luck lunches,\nwhere everybody can kind of come together.\n\n111\n00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:21.885\nThey bring something from their home,\nand they allow their personal life,\n\n112\n00:05:21.885 --> 00:05:24.145\nmaybe their personal cooking,\nthey're [INAUDIBLE].\n\n113\n00:05:24.145 --> 00:05:26.720\nAnd we sit down, and we have a meal,\nand we share a meal together.\n\n114\n00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.560\nI mean that as simple as it can be and\nthat will create a very harmonious culture\n\n115\n00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.010\namongst millennials and\nyour other team members.Now,\n\n116\n00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.720\nso other companies have taken this a step\nfurther so we do offsite activities.\n\n117\n00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.070\nMaybe we take a day where we go out and we\nhave a picnic or company picnic outside,\n\n118\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.200\nin a park and maybe some people\nwill bring some stuff and\n\n119\n00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.190\nwe'll cook it on the grill or\nwe'll do something.\n\n120\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.400\nThese kind of activities have led to the\nbest cultures which lead to the highest\n\n121\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.790\nperforming companies.\n\n122\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.510\nAnd this is what millennials are really,\n\n123\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.090\nreally looking for\nwhen it comes to the workplaces.\n\n124\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.300\nTheir personal and\ntheir work life are one thing.\n\n125\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.320\nNow going a little bit further with that,\nmillennials have been said to be lazy.\n\n126\n00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.470\nThey're like,\nmillennials don't like to work.\n\n127\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.730\nI found the exact opposite.\n\n128\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.700\nMillennial's are probably the hardest\nworking generation that I found.\n\n129\n00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.880\nMillennial's will work so\nhard for you or for\n\n130\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.800\nyour company,\nthat it kind of blows my mind.\n\n131\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.120\nThe thing is that, we're just defining\nthe hard work a little bit differently.\n\n132\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.690\nSee millennial's Since\ntheir personal work and\n\n133\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.370\nthey're work life is one thing you will\nfind millennials often working from home,\n\n134\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.000\nanswering e-mails at odd times of day or\nnight.\n\n135\n00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.310\nComing in and staying a little bit late.\n\n136\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.800\nYeah they might not be the first ones that\nshow up at the office maybe they're not\n\n137\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.780\nmorning people great.\n\n138\n00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.390\nYou're telling me that no Gen X person\nhas ever not been a morning person?\n\n139\n00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.015\nThat's not true.\n\n140\n00:06:41.015 --> 00:06:43.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's one right here,\nthere's one right here for sure.\n\n141\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.070\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\nMillennials will stay after hours.\n\n142\n00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.900\nThey'll answer emails at odd hours at odd\ntimes of day or night On the weekends,\n\n143\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.780\nbecause they believe in the company,\nbecause they're passionate\n\n144\n00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.940\nabout delivering the great\nservice to their customers.\n\n145\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.910\nSo putting together\nthat their personal and\n\n146\n00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.540\nwork life is intertwined, they're not\nnecessarily registering it as work time.\n\n147\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.650\nThey're registering it as well,\nI like what I do, I have fun doing it,\n\n148\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.850\nI believe in what I do, and\njust continue to do it.\n\n149\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.770\nSo Their personal life and their work life\ndoesn't have that clear delineation and\n\n150\n00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.130\nthey don't really necessarily\nfeel like it's work.\n\n151\n00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.010\n&gt;&gt; So you made a point a little bit\nearlier about kinda having friendships and\n\n152\n00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.040\nrelationships then at work.\n\n153\n00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.410\nI hate to be the devils advocate here but\nare there problems then when you, if\n\n154\n00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.200\nyou become too close friends with someone\nyou work with and then these millennial's\n\n155\n00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.670\nwill be moving up the ladder and all of\na sudden you're in a management position.\n\n156\n00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.440\nDo we issues then where people are maybe\nputting they're friends ahead of others or\n\n157\n00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.540\nthat kind of thing?\n\n158\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.120\n&gt;&gt; So I think that Millennials\nhave found a way to really\n\n159\n00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.670\ncreate the harmonious culture\namongst their team members.\n\n160\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.780\nAnd I don't, I haven't experienced\npersonally that millennials technically\n\n161\n00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.350\nhold each other down, or\nthey create friction amongst their\n\n162\n00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.950\npeers when they start getting promoted and\nothers don't.\n\n163\n00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:57.740\nI don't see that,\n\n164\n00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.290\nI actually see the opposite, they kind of\nrejoice and celebrate amongst each other.\n\n165\n00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.540\nThey create this very big sense of team.\n\n166\n00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.450\nIn my company We kinda call it family\ncuz we spend so much time together and\n\n167\n00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.760\nwe just get along so much.\n\n168\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.300\nOur core values are in line.\n\n169\n00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.600\nOur purpose is in line that we\nwould call ourselves family.\n\n170\n00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.930\nOur company is a family.\n\n171\n00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:23.380\nSo going to your point,\nmillenials are big on family.\n\n172\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.290\nThey're big on our team as one.\n\n173\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.130\nAnd when you create that kind of culture\nIt goes to the point that I hear\n\n174\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.040\na lot of entrepreneurs struggling with\nthat, I can't retain Millennials.\n\n175\n00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.530\nLet me tell you,\nin the companies that I have,\n\n176\n00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.790\nin my company I've never\nhad one single person quit.\n\n177\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.710\nNot one.\nAnd that's a crazy statistic.\n\n178\n00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.630\nRight but why is that?\n\n179\n00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.490\nWhy does that happen?\n\n180\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.480\nI've asked my team members.\n\n181\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.660\nSay why don't you quit?\n\n182\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.140\nWhy do you stay here for so long?\n\n183\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.720\nYou've been with me for ten plus years.\n\n184\n00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.710\nWhy do you stay here?\n\n185\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.870\nWhat is it about our company that you like\nand what is it that really drives you?\n\n186\n00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.860\nAnd they gave me a bunch of answers but\n\n187\n00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.760\nwhat I can kind of tie it all back\nto is There's a sense of family.\n\n188\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.870\nAnd we're taught and engrained,\nyou don't quit on family.\n\n189\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.860\nSo if you're going to be\nloyal to your family,\n\n190\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.510\nyou're going to stay with your family,\nyou create these friendships at work,\n\n191\n00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.030\nalmost people develop best friendships.\n\n192\n00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.360\nHow is it possible that even if some\nother company was coming to you trying to\n\n193\n00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.360\nrecruit you and offering you more money,\n\n194\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.380\nHow is it that you're gonna go to another\ncompany and leave your best friend behind?\n\n195\n00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:29.960\nVery unlikely.\n\n196\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.900\nWe don't quit on family.\n\n197\n00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.780\nThat's not just something we do, right?\n\n198\n00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.070\nThis is a lifestyle for them.\n\n199\n00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.300\nThis is their life.\n\n200\n00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.190\nIt's not my work life anymore.\n\n201\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.750\nIt's this is my life.\n\n202\n00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.660\nSo if we can understand that concept,\nYour gonna retain millennials for\n\n203\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.610\na very, very long time.\n\n204\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.460\nYou don't have that disconnect because\nthere's no longer these two worlds we're\n\n205\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.180\nokay I still get to keep my personal life.\n\n206\n00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.300\nThere work life becomes\ntheir personal life and\n\n207\n00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.160\nvice versa it's one thing for them.\n\n208\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.830\nI know it's hard for us Gen Xers to\nunderstand that because we were raised and\n\n209\n00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.750\ntaught a certain way but understand\nthat for a millennial, it is one thing.\n\n210\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.020\nThis is one world it's one life.\n\n211\n00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.250\nIf one experience.\n\n212\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.450\nMy experience at work is just as important\nas my experience outside of work,\n\n213\n00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.350\nbecause it's one thing.\n\n214\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.510\nSo as entrepreneurs what do we do.\n\n215\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:18.420\nWe need to encourage that our team\ndevelopes these friendships, right.\n\n216\n00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.290\nWe need to set rooms\naside in our offices for\n\n217\n00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.080\nthem to be able to have\noffline conversations.\n\n218\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.840\nIn my company one of\nthe things that I've done.\n\n219\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.480\nThat is phenomenal.\n\n220\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.660\nEvery single person on my team will tell\nyou it's one of their favorite parts\n\n221\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.880\nof working in our company.\n\n222\n00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.440\nWe have a weekly meeting\nevery single week,\n\n223\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.750\nit happens every single Monday,\nwhere we talk about the stuff for week.\n\n224\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.160\nAnd the way we open up this meeting,\nevery single week,\n\n225\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.580\nis everybody must share one personal\nbusiness win that they've had that week,\n\n226\n00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.560\nand one personal business\nwin that they had that week.\n\n227\n00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.100\nWhat does that do?\n\n228\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.580\nNumber one, we get to celebrate everything\nthat the person's accomplished within\n\n229\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.680\ntheir work, right?\n\n230\n00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.840\nSo you just closed a new deal.\n\n231\n00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.600\nGreat, everybody claps and cheers them on.\n\n232\n00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.360\nSecond, you're asking that person to share\nsomething that they're comfortable sharing\n\n233\n00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.270\nabout their personal life\nthat they consider a win,\n\n234\n00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.700\nthat's important in their life.\n\n235\n00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.300\nHow valuable is that?\n\n236\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.110\nIn our company we have people who've\ngotten engaged, who've gotten pregnant.\n\n237\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.440\nSharing important things that\nthey want to rejoice and\n\n238\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.970\ncelebrate with their second family.\n\n239\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.680\nIt's, it's what's important to them and\nas leaders we should know those things but\n\n240\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.530\nwe've been conditioned to be in\nthis environment where don't ask\n\n241\n00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.980\npeople what's going on in their lives,\nthat's their personal life,\n\n242\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.380\nand that's not something\nyou want to probe about and\n\n243\n00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.270\nit's uncomfortable as business leaders and\nentrepreneurs.\n\n244\n00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.560\nYou don't just want to go up to Sally and\nsay hey Sally.\n\n245\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.070\nSo, yeah, how's the dating going?\n\n246\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.670\nI mean, that's a really\nuncomfortable conversation.\n\n247\n00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.910\nBut, when you frame it the way that I'm\npresenting it, where we sit down in\n\n248\n00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.510\na meeting, you tell me what you're\ncelebrating, what are you happy about, and\n\n249\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.480\nwhat did you celebrate this week, what did\nyou win this week, and they say, well,\n\n250\n00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.480\nmy son just hit their first home run\nThat's a huge thing for that person.\n\n251\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.190\nOut of all the things to happen\nto them in the last seven days,\n\n252\n00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.680\nthey're telling you that their one win\nis that their son just hit a home run.\n\n253\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.470\nAnd their entire team gets to clap and\nrecognize them, that person feels so good.\n\n254\n00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.110\nThat person feels so connected and\n\n255\n00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.490\nthat creates opportunities for\nyour team members.\n\n256\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.880\nTo start conversations offline,\nto develop those relationships, right,\n\n257\n00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.500\nsaying, my God.\n\n258\n00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.640\nI remember when my son first hit his home\nrun, and this is what I did for him.\n\n259\n00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.190\nYou start connecting on a different level\nwhere it's not just always about business.\n\n260\n00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.110\nYou start finding things that you\nhave in common with other people\n\n261\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.860\nthat are outside of business that\nwill really tie you together.\n\n262\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.390\nAnd that's where friendships are made.\n\n263\n00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.060\nThat's where the things are really\nimportant to intertwine.\n\n264\n00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.800\nAnd we've gotta understand that\nthis generation has both of these\n\n265\n00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.720\nthings into one.\n\n266\n00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.180\nWe define them as two things,\nfor them it's just one thing.\n\n267\n00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I think that's interesting,\nbecause if you look back at Gen X,\n\n268\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.820\nif you look back at baby boomers, if you\n&gt;&gt; Describe this kinda situation and\n\n269\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.350\nthey'd say,\nmy work life balance is out of whack now.\n\n270\n00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.260\nIt sounds like work is taking over.\n\n271\n00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.720\nBut, what we're saying here is that\nbringing those two things together\n\n272\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.150\ndefinitely not a bad thing for\na millennial.\n\n273\n00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:03.570\nIt's something that they thrive on and\nhelps them improve their personal life and\n\n274\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.770\ntheir professional life at the same time.\n\n275\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.150\nSo those are some great points there.\n\n276\n00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.930\nAny final thoughts on this topic?\n\n277\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\njust to clarify exactly what you mentioned\n\n278\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.440\n&gt;&gt; And this may drive the point home so\n\n279\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.848\ni just wanna give the example again.\n\n280\n00:13:13.848 --> 00:13:18.380\nMillennials are so\n\n281\n00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.600\nfocused that they really need to enjoy\ntheir work and they need to have purpose\n\n282\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.400\nin their work and they won't\ntolerate not enjoying their work.\n\n283\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.370\n&gt;&gt; Previous generations were focused on\nsecurity, that they had to keep their job.\n\n284\n00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.650\nYou have to stay with a company until\nyou find another job because you\n\n285\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.290\nneed security.\n\n286\n00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.840\nBecause you have to pay for your bills,\nbecause you have to provide for\n\n287\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.440\nyour family.\n\n288\n00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.750\nAnd that security is the main driver.\n\n289\n00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.760\nFor millennials,\nthe main driver is not security.\n\n290\n00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.810\nThe main driver is happiness.\n\n291\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.310\nAnd millennials are so\nfocused on saying, I'm gonna be happy.\n\n292\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.880\nAnd it's not like previous generations,\nsays, Well, you work for 30 or\n\n293\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.700\n40 years of you life, and then you\nget to enjoy retirement and be happy.\n\n294\n00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.210\nMillennials say, no, no,\nno, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n295\n00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.830\nI've watched so many people not\neven make it to retirement.\n\n296\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.290\nOr, i've watched so many of my families,\nlike, not enjoy the whole process.\n\n297\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.280\nMillennials reject that idea completely.\n\n298\n00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.810\n&gt;&gt; Millennials say no, I'm gonna enjoy\nlife and I'm gonna enjoy it now.\n\n299\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.800\nAnd if I'm not enjoying\nwhat I'm doing I will quit.\n\n300\n00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.910\nThe sense of security is not in their\nworld, they don't care about that.\n\n301\n00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.130\nThey care about being happy and\nthey care about being happy now.\n\n302\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.630\nSo as we're thinking about this and\nthis concept\n\n303\n00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.490\nwe need to understand that part of their\nhappiness is enjoying what they do.\n\n304\n00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.100\nAnd if they don't connect\nwith their passion,\n\n305\n00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.520\nif they don't connect with their purpose.\n\n306\n00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.580\nIf they're not happy working with\nyour company, they will quit and\n\n307\n00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.780\nyou won't be able to retain them.\n\n308\n00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.160\n&gt;&gt; And so when we talk about people\ngoing from one job to the next,\n\n309\n00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.715\nit might be an issue of the employer\n&gt;&gt; They're not the employee that you need\n\n310\n00:14:44.715 --> 00:14:47.055\nto consider and\nit kind of tells you something about them.\n\n311\n00:14:47.055 --> 00:14:49.915\nBut I think that's a good spot for\nus to sign off on this episode.\n\n312\n00:14:49.915 --> 00:14:52.735\nWe've got a lot more great content\ncoming up in future episodes.\n\n313\n00:14:52.735 --> 00:14:55.275\nBut for\nnow signing off I've been Peter Van.\n\n314\n00:14:55.275 --> 00:14:57.209\n&gt;&gt; And this is Javier Montes\nyour millennial expert.\n\n315\n00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:58.393\nCatch you on the next side.\n\n316\n00:14:58.393 --> 00:15:00.053\n&gt;&gt; Bye bye.\n\n317\n00:15:00.053 --> 00:15:08.678\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

today,\n\n3\n00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.050\nwe're continuing in our series about\nunderstanding and working with millenials.\n\n4\n00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.240\nAnd here to help us today, we have an\nexpert on the topic, a man who's written\n\n5\n00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.460\nthe book on the subject,\nThe Millenial Workforce, Javier Montes.\n\n6\n00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.340\nJavier how you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic Peter.\n\n8\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.850\nIt's such a pleasure to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.380\nThank you for having me once again.\n\n10\n00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.912\nAnd I think we're gonna go into talking\nall about the millennial mindset today,\n\n11\n00:00:27.912 --> 00:00:30.578\nand we're gonna dive\ninto a very unique topic,\n\n12\n00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:33.664\nwhich I'm gonna give you\na different perspective on.\n\n13\n00:00:33.664 --> 00:00:36.490\nCuz, I think a lot of people\nunderstand the topic.\n\n14\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.770\nI think they agree with the topic, but\n\n15\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.316\nI think they've just defined\nit a little bit incorrectly.\n\n16\n00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:45.850\nSo, the topic is called Millennials\nare Extremely Tech Dependent.\n\n17\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.780\n&gt;&gt; And I know we've got our\nphones here on the table.\n\n18\n00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right\n&gt;&gt; This is probably what we're\n\n19\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.000\ntalking about.\n\n20\n00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.600\n&gt;&gt; It is,\nI mean we're recording the video,\n\n21\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.355\nwe're also live on Facebook right now,\nI mean, which is kinda cool.\n\n22\n00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.150\nWe're streaming on the website.\n\n23\n00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.045\nI mean, this is what the world is all\nabout today, it's where it's come to.\n\n24\n00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:01.350\n&gt;&gt; Is this a bad thing?\n\n25\n00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.977\nIs this a good thing?\n\n26\n00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:02.707\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How does this fit in?\n\n27\n00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:04.260\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I think it's great.\n\n28\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.850\nI mean,\nhow many people are tuning in right now?\n\n29\n00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.680\nLook at that, that are getting the content\nbefore it's even done and edited.\n\n30\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.700\nSo I mean, I couldn't be more\ntrue to instant gratification.\n\n31\n00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.100\nGetting the content out there and\nreally sharing our information and\n\n32\n00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.070\nour knowledge, and our experience in\nthe most effective and efficient manner.\n\n33\n00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.620\nSo I mean, it's a great thing.\n\n34\n00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.845\nI mean, I see it as a great thing.\n\n35\n00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:25.911\n&gt;&gt; Great, so what that this mean now,\nin the workforce?\n\n36\n00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:31.078\nHow does being tech-dependent, does it\nhelp your company, hurt your company?\n\n37\n00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:32.738\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk about that.\n\n38\n00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:37.631\nSo the first thing that I think people\nalways characterize millennials as,\n\n39\n00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:39.012\nis being tech savvy.\n\n40\n00:01:39.012 --> 00:01:42.396\nI think that's the word that\nI hear most about people,\n\n41\n00:01:42.396 --> 00:01:45.710\nwhen they describe millennials,\ntech savvy.\n\n42\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.792\nNow, the truth is,\n\n43\n00:01:46.792 --> 00:01:50.687\nmillenials are not more tech-savvy\nthan any other generation, okay?\n\n44\n00:01:50.687 --> 00:01:52.750\nThat is the real truth.\n\n45\n00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.670\nTech savvy means that you know\nnaturally or through practice, how to\n\n46\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.060\noperate things, like electronic or things\nthat are more technologically advanced.\n\n47\n00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.740\nAnd that's not necessarily true.\n\n48\n00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.230\nI mean, yeah,\nwe may think that sounds about right, but\n\n49\n00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.420\nthe right term is actually tech dependent,\nall right?\n\n50\n00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.610\nLet's define why this is true, and\nwhy I'm defining it in this way.\n\n51\n00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.140\nSo tech savvy, again, is saying that\nthey have the natural ability to\n\n52\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.900\nunderstand all electronics,\nand that's not true.\n\n53\n00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.570\nThat's not true at all.\n\n54\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.550\nIn fact, I mean, we're talking here\nin the studio, and we're looking at\n\n55\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.500\nall these electronics, and I can't tell\nyou that you know how to operate them\n\n56\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.060\nvery well better than me, or I know\nhow to operate them better than you.\n\n57\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.870\nSo when we're talking about tech savvy,\nI don't think that's the right term.\n\n58\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.120\nWe know that millennials thrive with\nelectronics and technology, but\n\n59\n00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.690\nthey're not necessarily tech savvy,\nthey are actually tech dependent.\n\n60\n00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.880\nAnd tech dependent refers to\na millennial was brought up in a world\n\n61\n00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.350\nfull of technology.\n\n62\n00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.710\nA millennial was brought up in a world,\nthat their entire lives revolved and\n\n63\n00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.760\ndepended on technology so\nmuch that today, in their adult lives,\n\n64\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.980\nmillennials depend on this technology\njust to be able to operate.\n\n65\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.578\nAnd if you take some of these tools and\n\n66\n00:03:07.578 --> 00:03:10.810\ntake some of this technology away\nfrom them, you're gonna put them\n\n67\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.800\nin a position where they're going to be\nvery uncomfortable and extremely unhappy.\n\n68\n00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.580\nRight, so diving into this concept,\n\n69\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.830\nwe're gonna talk about things like having\nsocial media access at work, right?\n\n70\n00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.670\nThis is one of those concepts\nthat's always taboo.\n\n71\n00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.300\nDo we allow them to have social\nmedia access at work, or\n\n72\n00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.790\ndo we just ban that, right?\n\n73\n00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.890\nWhen social media first started\ncoming out, every company,\n\n74\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.300\nevery organization said,\nhey, no social media.\n\n75\n00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.515\nNo cell phones allowed,\nyour cell phones must be off at work.\n\n76\n00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:43.960\nAnd it sounded like a decent idea, but you\nstarted creating this culture that forbid\n\n77\n00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.910\npeople from even touching\ntheir cell phones.\n\n78\n00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.232\nNow, I mean we're here right, we're\nworking, and we're on our phones, right?\n\n79\n00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:55.820\nWe're doing stuff that promotes what we're\ntrying to do, and that is really the key.\n\n80\n00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.860\nI think that, and millenials, yeah,\n\n81\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.200\nthere's a little bit of\nsocial involved in it, but\n\n82\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.910\nmillennials will use that technology\nreally, to promote your organization.\n\n83\n00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.830\nAnd they're gonna use it so\nthey can be efficient.\n\n84\n00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.100\nYou see, I think that the key in all this,\n\n85\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.780\nis that organizations need to\nstart embracing technology.\n\n86\n00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.470\nAnd they need to\nunderstand that technology\n\n87\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.970\ncan only help your organization\nbe more efficient.\n\n88\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.510\nNow millennials and their mindset, and\nthey're so dependent on this technology,\n\n89\n00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.150\nthat if you create a policy\nlike no cellphones at work,\n\n90\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.180\nyou're gonna really turn these people off.\n\n91\n00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.150\nYou're gonna turn your team off.\n\n92\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.437\nNow, that sounds a little bit harsh,\nthat sounds a little bit extreme.\n\n93\n00:04:36.437 --> 00:04:41.680\nBut when we're talking about technology,\nit's as simple as things like laptops.\n\n94\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.300\nSo many companies are still\ntying all of their employees,\n\n95\n00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.980\nincluding sales people,\nto a desktop computer.\n\n96\n00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.630\nNow, when a potential millennial\nwalks into your company and\n\n97\n00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.665\nsee's that every single person in that\ncompany is on a desktop computer,\n\n98\n00:05:00.665 --> 00:05:02.740\nyou're indirectly sending\na message saying,\n\n99\n00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.490\nwe don't allow you to work\nfrom outside the office.\n\n100\n00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.188\nYou need to work from here,\neverybody works from here.\n\n101\n00:05:09.188 --> 00:05:11.798\nNow, when they walk in and\nthey see half your team, or\n\n102\n00:05:11.798 --> 00:05:15.974\nmaybe all of your team working on laptops,\nyou're sending out a different message,\n\n103\n00:05:15.974 --> 00:05:18.700\nand you're saying we're\nembracing technology.\n\n104\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.070\nWe understand that certain\nlife situations may happen.\n\n105\n00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.320\nAnd it may be more convenient for\nyou to be mobile.\n\n106\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.830\nMaybe you're a salesperson, and\nyou're gonna be out on the road.\n\n107\n00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.810\nAnd we want you to have\naccess to technology.\n\n108\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.340\nWe want you to be able to use the power\nof technology to get better, or\n\n109\n00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.910\nmore efficient.\n\n110\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.220\nI mean, so many companies nowadays,\n\n111\n00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.620\nit blows my mind how any\norganization that has a sales team,\n\n112\n00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.344\nI don't care if it's one person,\nI don't care if it's a thousand people.\n\n113\n00:05:42.344 --> 00:05:45.437\nIf you have a sales team, if you\nhave a sales person in your company,\n\n114\n00:05:45.437 --> 00:05:48.050\nwhich I'm assuming everybody does.\n\n115\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.640\nHow does your company\noperate without a CRM?\n\n116\n00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.630\nYou need to have a CRM in place for\nyour organization.\n\n117\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.495\nIf you expect your sales team to run\noff Excel, that is completely outdated.\n\n118\n00:06:00.495 --> 00:06:03.830\nIt's ineffective, and\nit will no way scale your business.\n\n119\n00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.790\nYou need to start embracing technology,\nand use the power of technology, so\n\n120\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.110\nthat your team can be extremely powerful.\n\n121\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.740\nMillennials come in,\nsalesperson or non-salesperson,\n\n122\n00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.610\nthey come into your company.\n\n123\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.130\nThe first thing they should be\nasking is do you have a CRM?\n\n124\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.670\nWhat CRM do you use?\n\n125\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.210\nBecause that is so powerful.\n\n126\n00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.220\nWithout that, there's so much manual\nlabor that needs to happen, that is so\n\n127\n00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.560\nredundant and so ineffective.\n\n128\n00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.530\nAnd that will completely create\na disconnect with the millennial, or\n\n129\n00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.620\nwith any other person that has\nexperience working with a CRM.\n\n130\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.740\nThey know, you need that.\n\n131\n00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.110\nBut you have to be able to embrace\nthese new technologies because,\n\n132\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.260\na millennial again,\nwill reject these ideas, and\n\n133\n00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.920\ncompletely disconnect, and\nsay I'm going somewhere else.\n\n134\n00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.270\nAgain, unlike previous generations, that\nsay, well okay, I'll tolerate your Excel,\n\n135\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.205\nmaybe I'll convince you down\nthe line to get a CRM, right?\n\n136\n00:06:52.205 --> 00:06:55.000\nMillennials will say,\nyou don't have that, I quit.\n\n137\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.490\nOr, I'm not even gonna work for you.\n\n138\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that tells them that,\n\n139\n00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.620\nmaybe you're a little bit behind\nthe times in your company.\n\n140\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.400\n&gt;&gt; It's an indirect signal to them,\nthat tells them about your culture, and\n\n141\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.270\nthe direction in which\nyour company is going.\n\n142\n00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.515\nAnd you cannot take these tools\naway from the millennials.\n\n143\n00:07:06.515 --> 00:07:12.130\nBecause, while previous generations\nused the cell phone to make phone calls,\n\n144\n00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.980\nthis generation uses it for\ntext messages, like it's natural.\n\n145\n00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.050\nThis generation will be\ntexting your customers.\n\n146\n00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.590\nNow all the HR people flip out about that.\n\n147\n00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.330\nLike, my gosh, what are we doing?\n\n148\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.950\n&gt;&gt; And the security people flip out too,\n\n149\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.170\nwith the whole bring your own\ndevice to work kind of crowd.\n\n150\n00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.597\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\neverybody starts flipping out, right?\n\n151\n00:07:28.597 --> 00:07:30.417\nSo I mean, but\nthere's ways around that, right?\n\n152\n00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:33.060\nYou just gotta get creative and\nunderstand how you can control that.\n\n153\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.260\nBut understand that they want\nto communicate via text.\n\n154\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.150\nProbably most of the businesses that are\ngonna be working with your company have\n\n155\n00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:46.270\nmillennials, or the clients you're\nselling to are millennials.\n\n156\n00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.130\nI mean, it's just natural, it's gonna\nhappen because they're coming of age, and\n\n157\n00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.300\nthey're coming into the work place,\n\n158\n00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.760\nit's natural that you're gonna\nbe selling to millennials.\n\n159\n00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.170\nHow do those millennials\nwant to communicate?\n\n160\n00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.030\nThey wanna communicate\nthrough text message.\n\n161\n00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.140\nYou start forcing them,\n\n162\n00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.940\nI know we think that email is the modern\nway, email is not that modern anymore.\n\n163\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.650\nEmail is one of those things,\n\n164\n00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.810\nalmost like, email to millennial\nis like a fax is to a Gen X.\n\n165\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.170\nRight, it's okay it was the modern thing.\n\n166\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.600\nEverybody has one,\nwe do it because it's natural.\n\n167\n00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.630\nBut understand that millenials now,\n\n168\n00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.650\nI want to text you because\nI want an instant answer.\n\n169\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.400\nNow, now, now.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n170\n00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.690\nwe keep talking about\nAmazon as a great example.\n\n171\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.574\nI mean if you go to their support page and\nyou have a problem with an order,\n\n172\n00:08:26.574 --> 00:08:28.166\nyou can call, you can email,\n\n173\n00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:31.692\nor you can chat right there, and\nit almost tells you it's by age.\n\n174\n00:08:31.692 --> 00:08:35.429\nYou've got Baby Boomer, you've got Gen X,\nand now you've got millennials in there,\n\n175\n00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.853\nbecause that's the way to\njust get that instant answer,\n\n176\n00:08:37.853 --> 00:08:40.590\nyou can still be multitasking,\ndo something else.\n\n177\n00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:45.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this technology you have\nin your organization, or lack thereof,\n\n178\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.730\nis extremely critical.\n\n179\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.120\nAnd again, remember that this is how this\ngeneration communicates with their family,\n\n180\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.970\nwith their friends.\n\n181\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.130\nI mean, Gen Xers defined communication,\nor staying in touch with friends right,\n\n182\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:02.230\nas a phone call where you'd have a voice\nconversation once every so often.\n\n183\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:07.490\nMilennials, if we're friends on Facebook,\nwe're connected, right, that's it.\n\n184\n00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.180\nWe're connected, and we're okay with it.\n\n185\n00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.360\nAnd our receiving friend\nmillennial understands it.\n\n186\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.440\nThat's how we're connected.\n\n187\n00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.790\nWe don't need to to pick up the phone and\n\n188\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.780\nactually have a physical conversation\nto maintain the relationship.\n\n189\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.190\nWhich I know is hard to understand,\nbut just understand that it's true.\n\n190\n00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.060\nUnderstand that that's how they reason.\n\n191\n00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.520\nSo the moment you take away technology,\nand\n\n192\n00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.640\nyou take away access to Facebook, or\nyou take away access to the social media,\n\n193\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.340\nyou're literally shooting\nyourself in the foot.\n\n194\n00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.320\nBecause these millennials will be tweeting\nabout your company culture, will be\n\n195\n00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.460\nInstagramming pictures, live videos about\nall the cool things your company is doing\n\n196\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.410\n&gt;&gt; Or go on Glassdoor and\n\n197\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.400\ntell you about the bad things you're\ndoing, if you do have some of those things\n\n198\n00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.830\nin place I'm sure there's\nexceptions to the rules.\n\n199\n00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.810\nLike here we have some editing stations.\n\n200\n00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.070\nThose have to be these big machines\nthat are tied to your desk.\n\n201\n00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.650\nOr if you're working at the NSA,\n\n202\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.795\nyou're probably not bringing your\nphone into work, or not allowed to.\n\n203\n00:09:56.795 --> 00:09:57.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But n most cases,\n\n204\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:03.650\nit sounds like giving them some of those\npersonal freedoms, are maybe going to just\n\n205\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:09.210\nmake them a lot happier at work, and\nhelp them to enjoy the culture more.\n\n206\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\nAnd, again,\n\n207\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.270\nremember they're dependent\non this technology, right?\n\n208\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.610\nThey live their lives out there.\n\n209\n00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.380\nSo if they live their\nlives on this technology,\n\n210\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.880\nit's almost like a habit\nthat they naturally have.\n\n211\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.190\nAnd if we're understanding the concept of\ntheir personal life and their work life as\n\n212\n00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:26.030\none thing, then when they come into work,\nyou're creating a disconnect again.\n\n213\n00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.000\nYou're creating that space,\nthat tension, which makes them unhappy,\n\n214\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.080\nwhich will lead to unhappy employees,\nwhich will lead to them quitting.\n\n215\n00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.690\nAnd you're not gonna\ncreate that culture and\n\n216\n00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.440\nthat environment that you wanna create.\n\n217\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.130\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Javier.\n\n218\n00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.440\nIt looks like we're getting close to\nthe end of the time for this episode.\n\n219\n00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.940\nAny final thoughts, here?\n\n220\n00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.932\n&gt;&gt; No, I just want to be clear that\nmillennials are not necessarily\n\n221\n00:10:45.932 --> 00:10:46.840\ntech savvy.\n\n222\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.580\nSo bringing on a millennial and\nexpecting them to know how to work\n\n223\n00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.260\nall of your electronics,\nit's not something that's an expectation.\n\n224\n00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.480\nThey still need to be trained on\nthings and how to use certain things.\n\n225\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.635\nJust because they're younger,\n\n226\n00:10:57.635 --> 00:10:59.911\ndoesn't mean that they know how\nto operate all the electronics.\n\n227\n00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:02.136\nThe key word here is\nthey're tech dependent, so\n\n228\n00:11:02.136 --> 00:11:03.718\nthey will depend on these things.\n\n229\n00:11:03.718 --> 00:11:05.354\nThey run their lives on here, and\n\n230\n00:11:05.354 --> 00:11:09.170\nthey need this technology to be able\nto run your organizations as well.\n\n231\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.870\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n232\n00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.780\nGreat information there.\n\n233\n00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.310\nI know we've got a lot more great\ninformation to cover in some\n\n234\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.540\nsubsequent episodes.\n\n235\n00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.980\nIf you haven't seen the previous ones,\ngo back and watch those and\n\n236\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.750\nlearn a lot about what we've\ntalked about already with\n\n237\n00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.270\nunderstanding millennials\nin the workplace.\n\n238\n00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.970\nBut for now, signing off,\nI'm Peter Van Rysdam.\n\n239\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.890\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Javier Montes,\nyour millennial expert.\n\n240\n00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.322\nWe'll see you next

Peter VanRysdam.\n\n4\n00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.240\nAnd today, we are continuing in our series\nabout millennials in the workforce.\n\n5\n00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.460\nAnd here to help us,\nwe have an expert on the topic.\n\n6\n00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.890\nSo much so, he wrote the book\nMillennial Workforce, Javier Montes.\n\n7\n00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.830\nJavier, how are you're doing?\n\n8\n00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.180\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Peter.\n\n9\n00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.990\nThank you for having me.\n\n10\n00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.850\nIt's a pleasure to be here once again.\n\n11\n00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.030\nAnd I'm so excited to keep talking with\nyou about millennials in the workforce.\n\n12\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.396\n&gt;&gt; And I understand in this episode we're\ntalking about more now what millennials\n\n13\n00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:34.294\nare looking for in the workplace.\n\n14\n00:00:34.294 --> 00:00:37.410\nAnd what are we specifically\ntalking about in this episode?\n\n15\n00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.185\n&gt;&gt; So, today, we're gonna talk all about\nthe first general topic is what do\n\n16\n00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:43.700\nmillennials want in the workforce,\nin the workplace?\n\n17\n00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.514\nAnd the first thing millennials want\nin the workplace is they want our\n\n18\n00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:51.924\ncompanies to give their work meaning and\nvalue.\n\n19\n00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:53.480\nNow what does that mean exactly?\n\n20\n00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.130\nWhat does give my work meaning and\nvalue mean to a millennial?\n\n21\n00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.348\nAnd what does it mean to somebody that's\nrunning the organization, an entrepreneur,\n\n22\n00:01:01.348 --> 00:01:02.887\na business manager, a leader?\n\n23\n00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:05.370\nWhat does that mean exactly?\n\n24\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.240\nWell, let's start by understanding\nthat millennials are extremely clear\n\n25\n00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.290\non what their personal purpose in life is.\n\n26\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.920\nSo millennials have a very clear\nsense of what their passion is and\n\n27\n00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.580\nwhat their purpose is.\n\n28\n00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.055\nAnd as a millennial, they are looking for\n\n29\n00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:25.110\norganizations that can\nalign with their purpose.\n\n30\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.185\nSo what I've seen in the past and\nwhat I still see today.\n\n31\n00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:30.872\nI think a lot of entrepreneurs\ncome to me and ask me, Javier,\n\n32\n00:01:30.872 --> 00:01:32.520\nhow can I attract more millennials?\n\n33\n00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.411\nI can't retain them,\nthey don't stay with my company.\n\n34\n00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:39.007\nSo what is it that I can do\nto bring more millennials?\n\n35\n00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:41.670\nBecause I wanna bring this\ngeneration into my company.\n\n36\n00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.730\nAnd the first thing that I ask them is,\nwhat is your company's purpose?\n\n37\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.995\nAnd most of the time, Peter, what people\ntell me and the answers that they give me.\n\n38\n00:01:49.995 --> 00:01:57.745\nIs most Gen Xers will tell me\nsomething like well, they don't know.\n\n39\n00:01:57.745 --> 00:01:58.963\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I say, okay,\n\n40\n00:01:58.963 --> 00:02:00.890\nwell why did you start your business?\n\n41\n00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.050\nWhy did you start your\nbusiness in the first place?\n\n42\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.570\nAnd the first answer that I get is, well,\n\n43\n00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.450\nto make some money, and\nI laugh and I say, my gosh.\n\n44\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.460\nThat couldn't be farther from the truth.\n\n45\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.353\nBecause if that was true you\ncould have started any business.\n\n46\n00:02:15.353 --> 00:02:19.207\nBut you chose to start this particular\nbusiness because of something else.\n\n47\n00:02:19.207 --> 00:02:22.277\nThere's a deeper meaning, there's\na deeper purpose and a deeper passion.\n\n48\n00:02:22.277 --> 00:02:26.030\nThat every entrepreneur has for\nchoosing the business that they started.\n\n49\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.390\nAnd it's not to chase money.\n\n50\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.682\nMoney is a byproduct.\n\n51\n00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:32.780\nMoney is a tool that allows\nus to live our lives, but\n\n52\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.800\nit's not the reason why we\nreally started the business.\n\n53\n00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.148\nThere's a purpose and\na reason why we started the business.\n\n54\n00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:41.379\nAnd typically it's to change\nsomething that exists in the world.\n\n55\n00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.666\nOr to provide a service that\nwill make something easier for\n\n56\n00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:46.149\nyour customers, right.\n\n57\n00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:47.676\nThere is a reason why you started it.\n\n58\n00:02:47.676 --> 00:02:51.197\nAnd when I sit there and I ask,\n95% of the entrepreneurs and\n\n59\n00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:53.647\nbusiness owners that I ask this question.\n\n60\n00:02:53.647 --> 00:02:55.170\nTheir answer is, I don't know.\n\n61\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.700\nSo that's the first problem.\n\n62\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.830\nThe first problem is our businesses\ndon't know what our purpose is.\n\n63\n00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.170\nAnd for those of us that do,\ncomes a second problem.\n\n64\n00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.830\nAnd the second problem\nis that the businesses\n\n65\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.400\ndon't clearly communicate\nthat purpose to the world.\n\n66\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.000\nAnd that's where the disconnect comes in.\n\n67\n00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.033\nYou see, millennials are looking to\nalign their personal purpose with our\n\n68\n00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:15.198\norganization's purpose.\n\n69\n00:03:15.198 --> 00:03:17.030\nAnd if they can't find that purpose or\n\n70\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.847\nthey don't understand what\nyour company's purpose is.\n\n71\n00:03:19.847 --> 00:03:23.525\nThere's a disconnect and\nthey don't have any meaning or value.\n\n72\n00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:26.775\nTheir purpose is not aligned because\nthey can't align with anything.\n\n73\n00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:28.557\nSo as organizational leaders,\n\n74\n00:03:28.557 --> 00:03:31.729\nwhat we need to do first of all\nis really clearly sit down.\n\n75\n00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:36.064\nTake some time either by ourselves or\nwith our leadership team and write down,\n\n76\n00:03:36.064 --> 00:03:37.795\nwhy is it that we exist?\n\n77\n00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:39.875\nWhat is the purpose of our organization?\n\n78\n00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.261\nWhat do we wanna change in the world?\n\n79\n00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:44.624\nOne of my mentors asked me a while back,\nhe said,\n\n80\n00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.834\nwhat is it that exists\ncurrently in the world.\n\n81\n00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:52.540\nThat really upsets you that you\ndon't think should be the way it is?\n\n82\n00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.780\nThat's a great question.\n\n83\n00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.290\nThat's a great question and chances are,\n\n84\n00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.870\nthat leads you to start a business that\nwill fix that problem in the world.\n\n85\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.170\nI mean, for me, I'll be honest,\n\n86\n00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.590\nit was I built my company with\nan exclusive millennial workforce.\n\n87\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.780\nNot purposefully it just\nkind of happened that way.\n\n88\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.670\nAnd I decided to write this book.\n\n89\n00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.325\nI decided to pursue professional speaking.\n\n90\n00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:15.552\nBecause I was so\nupset about the way that people described\n\n91\n00:04:15.552 --> 00:04:20.480\nmillennials that didn't\naccurately describe my team.\n\n92\n00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.010\nMy team has been with my long term.\n\n93\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.460\nThey're not lazy,\nthey're hard working individuals.\n\n94\n00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.629\nThey're very proud of what they do.\n\n95\n00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:28.876\nAnd most of their days,\nmost of their weeks,\n\n96\n00:04:28.876 --> 00:04:32.560\nare dedicated to our business and\nour company.\n\n97\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.340\nAnd I said,\nhow can you say that they're entitled?\n\n98\n00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.130\nHow can you say that they're lazy?\n\n99\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.771\nMaybe your millennials have been lazy.\n\n100\n00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:40.215\nOr maybe,\nlike we've talked about in other videos.\n\n101\n00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:42.644\nMaybe we need to take a look\nin the mirror and say, whoa,\n\n102\n00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:44.920\nwhat are we doing as an organization?\n\n103\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.600\nAre we causing this?\n\n104\n00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.298\nAre we causing millennials to come\non board to our companies and\n\n105\n00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:51.356\nmaybe seem lazy.\n\n106\n00:04:51.356 --> 00:04:53.341\nOr maybe they're just unengaged.\n\n107\n00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:54.974\nAnd 95% of the time,\n\n108\n00:04:54.974 --> 00:05:00.680\nI can tie this back to the company not\nclearly communicating its purpose.\n\n109\n00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.840\nNow, how do we communicate our purpose?\n\n110\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.370\nWhat action can we take on this?\n\n111\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.383\nWe talked about number one,\nestablishing what that purpose is.\n\n112\n00:05:05.383 --> 00:05:09.244\nNumber two, the second most important\npart about communicating your purpose.\n\n113\n00:05:09.244 --> 00:05:11.841\nIs you need to be very clear and blunt and\n\n114\n00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:15.560\ntell the entire world what\nyour company's purpose is.\n\n115\n00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.980\nHow do you do that?\n\n116\n00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.520\nYour company's purpose needs to be\nlisted clearly on your website.\n\n117\n00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.172\nI would say the first thing on top of your\nwebsite, right next to your company name,\n\n118\n00:05:23.172 --> 00:05:24.280\nright next to your logo.\n\n119\n00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.030\nShould be the reason why\nyour company exists.\n\n120\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.960\nNumber two, it should be in\nevery e-mail signature that\n\n121\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.180\nyou have that goes out from\nall of your employees.\n\n122\n00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.500\nNumber three,\nit should be on your business cards.\n\n123\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.590\nIt should be on every single piece of\ncollateral material that you create,\n\n124\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.115\nyour purpose needs to be\nclearly stated there.\n\n125\n00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:44.130\nMillennials do not take subtle hints,\nall right?\n\n126\n00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.170\nThat's the truth.\n\n127\n00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.830\nYou can't expect them to\nguess what your purpose is.\n\n128\n00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.710\nRight now, if you don't have\nyour purpose clearly stated,\n\n129\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.690\nyour employees are guessing\nthe reason why your company exists.\n\n130\n00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.260\nMillennials and non-millennials,\nthey don't know what it is.\n\n131\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.810\nSee, a lot of us have this idea of\na vision statement or a mission statement.\n\n132\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.335\nAnd these are terms or phrases that\nwere created by previous generations.\n\n133\n00:06:06.335 --> 00:06:08.898\nTypically, in big corporate America,\nthey sit in some plaque or\n\n134\n00:06:08.898 --> 00:06:11.471\nin a frame in the CEO's office,\nmaybe the COO's office as well.\n\n135\n00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:12.825\nAnd nobody ever reads it.\n\n136\n00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:16.295\nYou ask the employees of that company what\nis our mission statement, why do we exist?\n\n137\n00:06:16.295 --> 00:06:19.225\nAnd they'll rant off two or three words\nthat they may have heard one time.\n\n138\n00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.275\nMost of them are gonna say,\nI have no idea what it is.\n\n139\n00:06:21.275 --> 00:06:24.845\nI have no idea why we exist,\nI have no idea what our mission is.\n\n140\n00:06:24.845 --> 00:06:27.865\nWhy does our company continue to work so\nhard?\n\n141\n00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:28.995\nWhat are we trying to change in the world?\n\n142\n00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:30.210\nThey have no idea.\n\n143\n00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.656\nBecause it's not clearly communicated.\n\n144\n00:06:31.656 --> 00:06:34.702\nAnd when you don't clearly\ncommunicate what your purpose is,\n\n145\n00:06:34.702 --> 00:06:37.930\nit's impossible to create that\nalignment within your team.\n\n146\n00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.470\nIt's impossible to get everybody\npulling in the same direction because\n\n147\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.780\neverybody has no idea what\ndirection you're trying to go.\n\n148\n00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.830\nEverybody has no idea what you're trying\nto accomplish as an organization.\n\n149\n00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.410\nAnd I think that's critical\nto get clear alignment and\n\n150\n00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.950\nfocus in your team that everybody\ncan go in the same direction.\n\n151\n00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.450\nAnd this is exactly what I'm talking\nabout when I say give my work meaning and\n\n152\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.340\nvalue, right?\n\n153\n00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.100\nThey need to align their personal\npurpose with your company's purpose,\n\n154\n00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.740\nthat is how you attract millennials.\n\n155\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.948\n&gt;&gt; And I can even see this being\nthe case in a very large company.\n\n156\n00:07:08.948 --> 00:07:14.432\nMaybe your division,\nyour department has a specific purpose,\n\n157\n00:07:14.432 --> 00:07:19.520\nto help the other employees do things or\nthat kind of thing.\n\n158\n00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.920\nIf you're in an IT group or you're\nin marketing or something like that.\n\n159\n00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.270\nSo it can be kind of maybe\non different levels as well.\n\n160\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.680\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, definitely on\ndifferent levels it can exist.\n\n161\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.700\nAs the company grows,\n\n162\n00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.810\ndepartments become their small little\norganizations within corporations.\n\n163\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.560\nAnd totally, that's gonna start aligning.\n\n164\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.752\nI guarantee it's gonna be tied\nto the main company purpose.\n\n165\n00:07:37.752 --> 00:07:42.780\nBut how we achieve, how we deliver on\nthat purpose is how things change.\n\n166\n00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.510\nSo I constantly encourage people,\nyou need to get clear on your purpose.\n\n167\n00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.800\nYou need to get clear on why you exist.\n\n168\n00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.498\nAnd one of the other action items\nwhich I think you can take.\n\n169\n00:07:52.498 --> 00:07:56.931\nIs being extremely clear on your purpose\nand putting it in every single job posting\n\n170\n00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:00.310\nthat you put out there for\na new employment.\n\n171\n00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.958\nSo many companies, you go through Monster,\nyou go through Craigslist.\n\n172\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.151\nYou go through Indeed or\nany of these websites to look for jobs.\n\n173\n00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:09.217\nAnd all the job postings\nstart with qualifications.\n\n174\n00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:12.335\nThree years' experience in this,\ntwo years' experience in this,\n\n175\n00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:13.583\nmust be able to do x, y, z.\n\n176\n00:08:13.583 --> 00:08:14.827\nThat's how they lead.\n\n177\n00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:18.078\nIn our company and the most\nsuccessful companies that I've seen.\n\n178\n00:08:18.078 --> 00:08:21.065\nThe very first thing on\nthe top of that job ad is,\n\n179\n00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:24.150\nour purpose is to dot, dot, dot.\n\n180\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.712\nAnd we clearly communicate that.\n\n181\n00:08:25.712 --> 00:08:29.148\n&gt;&gt; And honestly, this is something that\neven if you don't have any millennials on\n\n182\n00:08:29.148 --> 00:08:31.370\nstaff, you should probably\nbe doing this anyway.\n\n183\n00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.340\nBecause if you don't know why\nyou're doing what you're doing,\n\n184\n00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.516\nyou're probably not doing\nit very well [LAUGH].\n\n185\n00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.511\nOr not doing it as well as you can.\n\n186\n00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:40.829\nSo definitely something\nimportant to have regardless.\n\n187\n00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:43.608\nBut any final thoughts on\nthis topic before we move on?\n\n188\n00:08:43.608 --> 00:08:48.181\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I can't stress enough about\nhiring based on this mindset, right?\n\n189\n00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:52.287\nReally attracting the millennials and\nnon millennials by leading with your\n\n190\n00:08:52.287 --> 00:08:55.090\npurpose in this job ad,\nand this job posting.\n\n191\n00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.934\nBecause otherwise I\nmean we've all done it.\n\n192\n00:08:56.934 --> 00:08:59.743\nIf anybody's here ever gone\nthrough hiring and what not.\n\n193\n00:08:59.743 --> 00:09:04.338\nYou get so many people that are just\napply, apply, apply, apply, apply, apply,\n\n194\n00:09:04.338 --> 00:09:06.365\nand you get all these applications.\n\n195\n00:09:06.365 --> 00:09:08.265\nMost of it is garbage, right?\n\n196\n00:09:08.265 --> 00:09:11.014\nBut there's a few people,\nwhen millennials start looking for work,\n\n197\n00:09:11.014 --> 00:09:12.702\nwhen millennials start looking for a job.\n\n198\n00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:17.665\nThe very first thing they do is they\ntype in certain words in the keyword.\n\n199\n00:09:17.665 --> 00:09:21.420\nAnd they pull up all the jobs that\nkind of match those keywords.\n\n200\n00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.710\nThey read,\nthey'll probably get through about five or\n\n201\n00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.159\nten different postings that\nkind of match their keywords.\n\n202\n00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:30.724\nAnd they will apply, wholeheartedly\ninterested in why that company exists.\n\n203\n00:09:30.724 --> 00:09:33.878\nIf you can create that alignment and\nyou can create that kind of drive.\n\n204\n00:09:33.878 --> 00:09:37.410\nYou're gonna get a really motivated\nmillennial who's aligned with the reason\n\n205\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.579\nwhy your company exists.\n\n206\n00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:41.024\nAnd that's where you're gonna\nget the quality millennial,\n\n207\n00:09:41.024 --> 00:09:42.206\nthe quality non millennial.\n\n208\n00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:46.184\nBecause somebody who believes what you\nbelieve wants to be part of the mission\n\n209\n00:09:46.184 --> 00:09:47.490\nthat you're on.\n\n210\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.040\nAnd that's where the key purpose is.\n\n211\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.330\nThat's where the key to really finding the\nright team and aligning your company so\n\n212\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.490\nthat everybody's pulling\nin the same direction.\n\n213\n00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.536\nIf you're not clear on that purpose.\n\n214\n00:09:57.536 --> 00:10:00.932\nWhat you're gonna get is you're gonna\nget an entire team of people pulling in\n\n215\n00:10:00.932 --> 00:10:01.985\nopposite directions.\n\n216\n00:10:01.985 --> 00:10:05.170\nAnd trying to accomplish God knows what\nbecause they're not clear on what you\n\n217\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.315\nwanna accomplish.\n\n218\n00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:10.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think in the past people would\nlook at the classifieds or look online and\n\n219\n00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:12.365\nsay, okay, I'm looking for a sales job.\n\n220\n00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:14.315\nSo show me all the jobs\nthat have to do with sales.\n\n221\n00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:16.555\nNow it seems like they're\nmore looking at the company.\n\n222\n00:10:16.555 --> 00:10:18.760\nShow me the companies that I align with.\n\n223\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.933\nAnd then let me find what they're hiring\nfor, and see if there's a fit there.\n\n224\n00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:26.510\nBecause it's more important about not what\nyou're doing, but who you're doing it for.\n\n225\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.318\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nYeah, and\n\n226\n00:10:27.318 --> 00:10:30.399\nI think within a few seconds of\nthe millennial's reading your job ad.\n\n227\n00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:33.587\nThey will know if they wanna be\na part of your company or not.\n\n228\n00:10:33.587 --> 00:10:34.334\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n229\n00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:35.250\n&gt;&gt; And then they'll move on to the next.\n\n230\n00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.416\nAnd I would probably last end with,\nthe best applicants that I've\n\n231\n00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:46.240\never gotten typically come maybe\na week after the job has been posted.\n\n232\n00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.310\nWhy?\nBecause when a job post goes up first,,\n\n233\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.260\nit kind of shows up new on the feed.\n\n234\n00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.500\nSo you get just random people that\nare just applying to all kinds of jobs.\n\n235\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.950\nAbout a week into it, your job post is no\nlonger the one on the top of the list.\n\n236\n00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.630\nIt's now hidden in the bunch,\nand the only people who\n\n237\n00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.010\nfind it are the ones that are searching\nkey words that are listed in the job.\n\n238\n00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.650\nAnd that is where you get\nthe people who are aligned.\n\n239\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.954\nIf you failed to describe your purpose.\n\n240\n00:11:09.954 --> 00:11:13.676\nAnd a millennial or a non-millennial\nsearches for some of those key words.\n\n241\n00:11:13.676 --> 00:11:18.160\nThat align with their purpose, with what\nthey're trying to accomplish, guess what?\n\n242\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.040\nThey're never gonna find you.\n\n243\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.800\nThey're just gonna go through\nqualifications just like any other\n\n244\n00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.470\ncompany has.\n\n245\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.978\nAnd you're never gonna get that top\nquality candidate who believes what\n\n246\n00:11:25.978 --> 00:11:26.481\nyou believe.\n\n247\n00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:27.490\nAnd that's the key.\n\n248\n00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.640\nSo millennials really want us as\nentrepreneurs, as business owners,\n\n249\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.890\nas business leaders,\nto give their work meaning and value.\n\n250\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.910\n&gt;&gt; Great points there, I know we've got\na lot more information to cover, and\n\n251\n00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.450\na lot more episodes to go here.\n\n252\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.760\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n253\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.455\nI'm Peter VanRysdam.\n\n254\n00:11:42.455 --> 00:11:44.686\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Javier Montes,\nyour millennial expert.\n\n255\n00:11:44.686 --> 00:11:45.516\nSee you next time.\n\n256\n00:11:45.516 --> 00:11:46.675\n&gt;&gt; Bye bye.\n\n257\n00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:56.675\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

And what is that?\n\n19\n00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.340\n&gt;&gt; So this one is going to be called\nacknowledge my strengths and successes.\n\n20\n00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.770\nSo this is important, this is key.\n\n21\n00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.950\nSo let's dive right into it.\n\n22\n00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.020\nLet's get started.\n\n23\n00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.860\nThank you for everybody tuning\nin on Facebook Live right now.\n\n24\n00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.720\nMake sure to say hi.\n\n25\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.140\nPut your comments in the box below,\neven if you're watching this afterwards.\n\n26\n00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.140\nPut your comments below.\n\n27\n00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.660\nI answer all the comments personally, so\nI could definitely check you guys out.\n\n28\n00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.990\nSo definitely answer personally and\n\n29\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.980\nwe'll answer some of these\ncomments as we go along.\n\n30\n00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.780\nBut let's get right into it.\n\n31\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.010\nLet's talk about acknowledge\nmy strengths and successes.\n\n32\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.070\nAnd what does this mean?\n\n33\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.874\nSo millennials are very keen and\nvery, what's the word,\n\n34\n00:01:18.874 --> 00:01:23.737\nvery aware of what their strengths are,\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:26.296\nSo we all have strengths and\nwe all have weaknesses.\n\n36\n00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:30.370\nAnd millennials, just like any other\ngeneration know what their strengths are.\n\n37\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.327\nThey know what they are really good at.\n\n38\n00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:32.785\nThey know what they are best at.\n\n39\n00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:36.806\nAnd they want these strengths\nto be acknowledged, okay?\n\n40\n00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.636\nThat's the first thing.\n\n41\n00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:43.244\nCompare that to previous generations,\nand again to put this into context.\n\n42\n00:01:43.244 --> 00:01:46.393\nMillennials want these strengths\nto really be amplified and\n\n43\n00:01:46.393 --> 00:01:48.004\nbe used in our organizations.\n\n44\n00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:53.419\nNow, previously to the modern day\nbig corporate America kind of had\n\n45\n00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:58.939\nthis mindset of, well, let's find\nout what our team is not good at.\n\n46\n00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.591\nLet's find out what the weaknesses\nare amongst our team, and\n\n47\n00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.480\nthen they would bring in outside trainers.\n\n48\n00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.470\nThey'd bring in consultants to\nhelp us improve the weaknesses.\n\n49\n00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.410\nMillinneals don't believe in this concept.\n\n50\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.480\nMillennials have very little interest\n\n51\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.440\nin improving the things that they're\nnot good at, and this is key.\n\n52\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.860\nBecause millennials would rather spend\ntime either learning a new skill or\n\n53\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.860\nimproving on what their strengths are.\n\n54\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.710\nAnd they don't really spend\na lot of time saying, well,\n\n55\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.670\nlook I know I'm not good at this.\n\n56\n00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.610\nAnd I don't really care too much to\nget a little better at it because\n\n57\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.410\nI'm not really interested in doing that.\n\n58\n00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.210\nSo their weaknesses are there and\nthey don't really care so\n\n59\n00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.920\nmuch to improve their weaknesses.\n\n60\n00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.580\nSo they want our companies to really find\nwhat they're really, really good at and\n\n61\n00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.380\nthen capitalize on that\ninside our organizations.\n\n62\n00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.520\nSo to put this into context, and\nI'll give you a really good example.\n\n63\n00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.616\nIt's one of my favorite examples that\nI think everybody can relate to.\n\n64\n00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:56.192\nIs let's talk about a football team,\nright?\n\n65\n00:02:56.192 --> 00:03:00.098\nSo, we recently had a couple big football\ngames that we were all watching.\n\n66\n00:03:00.098 --> 00:03:01.890\n[LAUGH] And let's talk about this, right?\n\n67\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.820\nSo let's just say you have\nan amazing wide receiver, right?\n\n68\n00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.730\nWhat is a wide receiver good at, Peter?\n\n69\n00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.200\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully catching the ball.\n\n70\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay, catching the ball,\n\n71\n00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.870\nprobably saying he's really\ngood at catching the ball.\n\n72\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.140\nHe's probably pretty good at running,\nas well, right?\n\n73\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.581\nProbably he runs fast so\nhe can get down the field, great.\n\n74\n00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:20.523\nSo we have a star wide receiver and\nthis wide receiver is really,\n\n75\n00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:22.105\nreally good at catching the ball.\n\n76\n00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:26.990\nNow in your team what kinda drills\nare you gonna work with him on?\n\n77\n00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.750\n&gt;&gt; Probably running some pass routes,\ncatching the ball.\n\n78\n00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.037\n&gt;&gt; Yup, and\nimproving on him catching better and\n\n79\n00:03:33.037 --> 00:03:35.210\nimproving on him probably running faster.\n\n80\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.850\nI mean,\nthat's what you're gonna focus on, right?\n\n81\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.800\nSo big corporate America traditionally\nwould say, well what is he not good at?\n\n82\n00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.830\nI would say he's probably not\ngood at throwing the ball.\n\n83\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.710\n&gt;&gt; Tackling.\n\n84\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Tackling maybe, right.\n\n85\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.520\nSo big corporate America says,\nyou know what?\n\n86\n00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.780\nLet's grab that wide receiver and\nlet's put him with our quarterback so\n\n87\n00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.140\nhe can learn how to throw\nthe ball a little bit.\n\n88\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.870\nNow does that make any sense?\n\n89\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.890\n&gt;&gt; Not a bit.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, exactly,\n\n90\n00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.820\nI feel the exact same way.\n\n91\n00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.241\nAnd millenials are very clear on this.\n\n92\n00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:06.999\nWhy in the world would you care,\nor spend an ounce of energy to get\n\n93\n00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:11.776\nyour star wide receiver to learn\nqualities that are not his job.\n\n94\n00:04:11.776 --> 00:04:13.110\nJust because he's not good at them?\n\n95\n00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.540\nWhy?\nBecause we believe that\n\n96\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.880\nhe should be well rounded?\n\n97\n00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.390\nI mean that's a crazy concept.\n\n98\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.990\nWhy be well rounded?\n\n99\n00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.950\nIf you have a star wide receiver\nyou want him to get better at\n\n100\n00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.860\nonly being a star wide receiver.\n\n101\n00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.700\nHe knows he's good at catching and\nhe knows he's good at running and\n\n102\n00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.130\nhe cares to improve on those skills only.\n\n103\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.120\nHe does not care to improve\nhis passing skills.\n\n104\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.570\nHe does not care to improve\nhis tackling skills.\n\n105\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.017\nBut corporate America does this all day,\nall the time.\n\n106\n00:04:38.017 --> 00:04:42.185\nFor years we've been doing this,\nsay, well, our team is weak in xyz.\n\n107\n00:04:42.185 --> 00:04:43.240\nWe need to improve that.\n\n108\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.986\nSo let's bring in an outside consultant,\n\n109\n00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:48.440\npay hundred of thousands of dollars to\ntry to get our team to improve that.\n\n110\n00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.100\nIt's the craziest thing ever.\n\n111\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.970\nIt's ludicrous, right?\n\n112\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.267\nBut we do it all the time.\n\n113\n00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:56.438\nAnd millennials are, once again,\nbringing this to the forefront and saying,\n\n114\n00:04:56.438 --> 00:04:57.066\nyou know what?\n\n115\n00:04:57.066 --> 00:04:59.260\nI'll be honest Mr. Boss.\n\n116\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.960\nI don't care to improve my passing skills.\n\n117\n00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.720\nI don't care to improve\nmy tackling skills.\n\n118\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.910\n&gt;&gt; And I think it's interesting too.\n\n119\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.170\nThere's kind of awareness and proficiency.\n\n120\n00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.510\nI think it's important for\n\n121\n00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.820\nsomeone to be aware of what\nthe other members of their team do.\n\n122\n00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.730\nAnd say, okay,\n\n123\n00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.440\nI understand how you do that and\nthat helps me work with you better.\n\n124\n00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.005\nMaybe it doesn't work so\nwell on the football analogy, but\n\n125\n00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:24.147\n[LAUGH] definitely works.\n\n126\n00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:27.014\nWell, if you understand how\nyour quarterback throws and\n\n127\n00:05:27.014 --> 00:05:28.514\nwhat his thought process is.\n\n128\n00:05:28.514 --> 00:05:32.560\nMaybe you can help him by getting open\nbetter, or running better routes or\n\n129\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.890\nthings like that.\n\n130\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.782\nSo I think that's important.\n\n131\n00:05:34.782 --> 00:05:37.933\nBut yeah, asking that wide receiver\nto become proficient at something.\n\n132\n00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:41.251\nUnless you've got some trick plays\nplanned where he's throwing or\n\n133\n00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:42.598\nsomehow playing defense.\n\n134\n00:05:42.598 --> 00:05:44.504\nThen that doesn't make any sense.\n\n135\n00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:46.294\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nyou brought up the right thing, right?\n\n136\n00:05:46.294 --> 00:05:51.245\nSo although the wide receiver\ndoes not need to understand how\n\n137\n00:05:51.245 --> 00:05:53.584\nto do the rest of the things.\n\n138\n00:05:53.584 --> 00:05:56.624\nHe knows he's an integral\npart of the team.\n\n139\n00:05:56.624 --> 00:06:00.018\nIf we're doing a running play he's\nnot gonna sit there and stand still.\n\n140\n00:06:00.018 --> 00:06:01.647\nAnd let everybody know\nwe're doing a running play.\n\n141\n00:06:01.647 --> 00:06:03.455\nAnd I'm clearly not\ngonna go catch the ball.\n\n142\n00:06:03.455 --> 00:06:07.498\nHis job as a member on the team,\nis distract the other people and\n\n143\n00:06:07.498 --> 00:06:11.028\ntake the opposite the defense\nas far away as possible.\n\n144\n00:06:11.028 --> 00:06:12.348\nSo that the runner can go.\n\n145\n00:06:12.348 --> 00:06:16.459\nHe understands his position,\nhe understands his value to the team and\n\n146\n00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.463\nhe will do his job in the way\nthat it needs to be done.\n\n147\n00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:24.744\nAnd if we can apply that simple example\nof a football team into our organization.\n\n148\n00:06:24.744 --> 00:06:29.620\nThen we can capitalize on what our team\nis really, really, really good at.\n\n149\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.330\nAnd only focus on those things and\ndevelop them on those\n\n150\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.610\nthings because that's what's\ngoing to make an all-star team.\n\n151\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.540\nThe best team in football is not the team\nthat has the most members that do the most\n\n152\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.990\namount of things better.\n\n153\n00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.740\n&gt;&gt; And so we're not saying,\nwe don't point out areas for\n\n154\n00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.380\nimprovement within that core skill set.\n\n155\n00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.095\nSo if for example, this wide receiver.\n\n156\n00:06:49.095 --> 00:06:51.133\nHey you're great at catching the ball, but\n\n157\n00:06:51.133 --> 00:06:53.679\nyou're not great at blocking\non these running plays.\n\n158\n00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:57.872\nLet's work on that because that is\na function of your job, correct?\n\n159\n00:06:57.872 --> 00:06:58.525\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n160\n00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:00.105\nwe're still going to these\npeople with these [INAUDIBLE].\n\n161\n00:07:00.105 --> 00:07:02.185\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean, yeah.\n\n162\n00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:04.995\nI'm gonna use an extreme example because\nI don't think anybody does this but\n\n163\n00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:07.065\nit's kinda to prove a point, right?\n\n164\n00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:11.635\nYou wouldn't get your IT person\nto go out on a sales call, right?\n\n165\n00:07:11.635 --> 00:07:14.735\nYou wouldn't care to teach your IT\nperson on how to be better in sales.\n\n166\n00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:16.990\nWhy would you put them in a sales class?\n\n167\n00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.670\nRight, but companies do this all the time.\n\n168\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.680\nThat's an extreme example.\n\n169\n00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.910\nBut we do things that we think, we should\nimprove our customer service skills.\n\n170\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.140\nSo we're gonna grab the janitors and\neverybody in the company, and\n\n171\n00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.640\nput them in a customer service training.\n\n172\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.400\nBecause there may be an opportunity\nto interact with a customer.\n\n173\n00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.510\nRight, that couldn't be\nfurther from the truth.\n\n174\n00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.950\nWe want to grab our star players and\nwe want to make them better stars.\n\n175\n00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.910\nWe want to get what they are really,\nreally good at.\n\n176\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:43.940\nMillennials are so keen on this.\n\n177\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.910\nThey know what they're good at and\n\n178\n00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.350\nthey want a company that acknowledges\ntheir strengths and says, you know what?\n\n179\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.800\nI'm going to put you to\ndo what you do best.\n\n180\n00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.264\nAnd that's exactly what\nthe millennial wants.\n\n181\n00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:56.057\nAnd why do they want that?\n\n182\n00:07:56.057 --> 00:07:59.930\nBecause that's how they add\nvalue to your company's purpose.\n\n183\n00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:00.899\nThat's how they add value.\n\n184\n00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:01.761\nThey say, you know what?\n\n185\n00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:05.565\nWhat I'm good at is being used to move the\ncompany's purpose a little bit further and\n\n186\n00:08:05.565 --> 00:08:07.186\nget closer to accomplishing that.\n\n187\n00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:08.710\nAnd their successes, listen,\n\n188\n00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.760\nmillennials want every single success\nthat they have to be recognized.\n\n189\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.710\nThat's the truth.\n\n190\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.420\nAnd in our companies,\n\n191\n00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.980\nwe've been conditioned to only\ncelebrate big successes, right?\n\n192\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.150\nSo we close a big deal,\nthat's when we celebrated.\n\n193\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.800\nBut every day there are opportunities for\nus to recognize small successes.\n\n194\n00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.020\nWe just had an example right now.\n\n195\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.580\nRight?\n\n196\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.270\nDidn't we talk about one\nrecently with Taylor?\n\n197\n00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.586\nDidn't Taylor do something\nreally amazingly correct?\n\n198\n00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:30.415\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n199\n00:08:30.415 --> 00:08:30.972\nYeah.\n\n200\n00:08:30.972 --> 00:08:31.478\nHe does a great job out there.\n\n201\n00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:33.819\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI mean Taylor did a great job and\n\n202\n00:08:33.819 --> 00:08:35.133\nyou recognized him.\n\n203\n00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:37.468\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And you did it in a playful manner and\n\n204\n00:08:37.468 --> 00:08:38.355\nthat's fine.\n\n205\n00:08:38.355 --> 00:08:41.400\nBut believe it or not that made\nTaylor feel really good, right.\n\n206\n00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.061\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask you about this.\n\n207\n00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:46.310\nBecause I've seen this now\nfrom kind of both sides.\n\n208\n00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:51.211\nWhere you've got the people that maybe\nare the baby boomers or the Gen Xers.\n\n209\n00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:55.265\nSaying, well they're just\nrewarding him for doing his job.\n\n210\n00:08:55.265 --> 00:08:57.580\n[LAUGH] Is that a bad thing?\n\n211\n00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.380\nIs that a good thing?\n\n212\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.670\nHow do you see that playing out?\n\n213\n00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.668\n&gt;&gt; So, I mean,\nthere's a definition of rewarding, right?\n\n214\n00:09:01.668 --> 00:09:04.166\nRewarding and\nacknowledging are two different things.\n\n215\n00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:04.803\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n216\n00:09:04.803 --> 00:09:09.365\n&gt;&gt; So that's probably the difference,\nnumber one.\n\n217\n00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:10.655\nNumber two,\n\n218\n00:09:10.655 --> 00:09:13.665\nI don't believe that millennials should\nget special treatment in the workplace.\n\n219\n00:09:13.665 --> 00:09:16.383\nRight, I think how our leadership\ntreats a millennial is how our\n\n220\n00:09:16.383 --> 00:09:18.207\nleadership should treat everybody else.\n\n221\n00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:20.682\nAnd to put things in context\nI talk about millennials.\n\n222\n00:09:20.682 --> 00:09:21.252\nAnd again,\n\n223\n00:09:21.252 --> 00:09:24.901\none of my biggest points is that\nmillennials bring things to the forefront.\n\n224\n00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:29.938\nAnd don't settle for things that maybe\nother generations may have settled for.\n\n225\n00:09:29.938 --> 00:09:33.959\nThere's not one person on your team right\nnow that does not want to be acknowledged\n\n226\n00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:35.602\nfor a success that they've had.\n\n227\n00:09:35.602 --> 00:09:37.135\nRegardless of how small it is.\n\n228\n00:09:37.135 --> 00:09:40.152\nThere's not one person on your team\nwho does not want to be recognized for\n\n229\n00:09:40.152 --> 00:09:41.560\na win that they had.\n\n230\n00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.290\nEvery single person on\nyour team would like that.\n\n231\n00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.281\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\nThe person that dissents and says,\n\n232\n00:09:46.281 --> 00:09:49.486\nI can't believe he's getting\nrecognized just for doing his job.\n\n233\n00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:51.667\nIf you told him the same thing,\nthat's gonna make him feel good inside.\n\n234\n00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:52.506\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n235\n00:09:52.506 --> 00:09:55.064\n&gt;&gt; So maybe they've never\nexperienced that before, and\n\n236\n00:09:55.064 --> 00:09:56.904\nthat's a good thing that a boss can do.\n\n237\n00:09:56.904 --> 00:09:59.856\nNot just for the millennials,\nbut for everyone in the company.\n\n238\n00:09:59.856 --> 00:10:02.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou need to create that culture, right?\n\n239\n00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.790\nAnd it does come from the leadership.\n\n240\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.918\nI mean, that's the way it goes.\n\n241\n00:10:04.918 --> 00:10:06.986\nAnd there are different\nlevels of recognition, but\n\n242\n00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:08.354\nit does come from the leadership.\n\n243\n00:10:08.354 --> 00:10:11.242\nAnd the leadership needs to create\nthat culture of recognition.\n\n244\n00:10:11.242 --> 00:10:12.742\nIt's not just for millennials.\n\n245\n00:10:12.742 --> 00:10:15.497\nDo not take this as, you get a millennial?\n\n246\n00:10:15.497 --> 00:10:17.434\nSo just recognize them for their wins.\n\n247\n00:10:17.434 --> 00:10:19.177\nNo, recognize your whole team.\n\n248\n00:10:19.177 --> 00:10:21.441\nYour whole team wants to feel\ngood about what they're doing.\n\n249\n00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:25.879\nWhen they have a success and they want\nsomething celebrated and recognized,\n\n250\n00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:26.776\nrecognize it.\n\n251\n00:10:26.776 --> 00:10:30.649\nIt doesn't cost us anything to say,\nhey you did a good job.\n\n252\n00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:33.150\nIt's just effort, and\nwe need to put into it.\n\n253\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.010\nAnd really look at our companies,\n\n254\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.180\nat our organizations, as a really\ngood culture and a family, right.\n\n255\n00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.760\nThat's what our teams are, when you create\nthat culture, you have an amazing team.\n\n256\n00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.490\nAnd every single person\nwants to be recognized.\n\n257\n00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.850\nAnd going back to what we were talking\nabout, grab your team and use them for\n\n258\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:51.940\nwhat they're really good at.\n\n259\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.720\nDon't spend any time developing\nthings that they have weaknesses.\n\n260\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.510\nThey know what their weaknesses are.\n\n261\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.923\nMillennials have weaknesses, Gen X has\nweaknesses, Baby Boomers have weaknesses,\n\n262\n00:10:59.923 --> 00:11:01.384\neverybody has weaknesses, right?\n\n263\n00:11:01.384 --> 00:11:03.524\n[LAUGH] That goes without saying.\n\n264\n00:11:03.524 --> 00:11:06.470\nThere's nobody who's\namazing at everything.\n\n265\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.360\nSo let's be clear on that.\n\n266\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.760\nBut we need to be more clear on,\nwhat is our team really good at?\n\n267\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.184\nWhat is each person really good at?\n\n268\n00:11:13.184 --> 00:11:15.016\nAnd let's put them to do that.\n\n269\n00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:17.716\nIf they're really good at interacting\nwith customers cuz they make your\n\n270\n00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:18.564\ncustomers feel good.\n\n271\n00:11:18.564 --> 00:11:21.520\nThat person should be\ninteracting with customers.\n\n272\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.250\nDon't put them to do things\nthat are behind the scenes.\n\n273\n00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.820\nLet them interact with your customers.\n\n274\n00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.700\nYeah, maybe they were hired for IT work.\n\n275\n00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.863\nBut they could be great\ncustomer service people.\n\n276\n00:11:31.863 --> 00:11:34.310\nOnce you identify that,\nput them to work in that area.\n\n277\n00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.594\nAnd you're going to watch\nyour results increase,\n\n278\n00:11:36.594 --> 00:11:39.952\nyour employee morale increase because\npeople enjoy what they're doing.\n\n279\n00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:43.538\nAnd you're going to watch your retention\nrate increase because they're naturally\n\n280\n00:11:43.538 --> 00:11:45.212\nenjoying what their natural state is.\n\n281\n00:11:45.212 --> 00:11:46.304\nAnd that's really what the key is.\n\n282\n00:11:46.304 --> 00:11:51.202\nMillennials want their strengths\nacknowledged and used in the company.\n\n283\n00:11:51.202 --> 00:11:53.697\nAnd again, look at what their\nsuccesses are and what they have.\n\n284\n00:11:53.697 --> 00:11:55.832\nAnd then celebrate them,\nno matter how small they are.\n\n285\n00:11:55.832 --> 00:11:56.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I think that's a great point.\n\n286\n00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.874\nI mean if you've got a wide receiver\ngoing back to that example,\n\n287\n00:11:59.874 --> 00:12:02.260\nwho you find out has\nthis great throwing arm.\n\n288\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.768\nWell maybe he's a better quarterback\nthan he is a wide receiver, and\n\n289\n00:12:04.768 --> 00:12:05.686\nyou need to look at that.\n\n290\n00:12:05.686 --> 00:12:08.239\nAnd I think the same thing goes for\nemployees.\n\n291\n00:12:08.239 --> 00:12:12.399\nI know here in our company we try to focus\non hiring people that are culture fits.\n\n292\n00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.023\nAnd then you find the right position for\nthem based on that.\n\n293\n00:12:15.023 --> 00:12:16.239\nSo that position can change.\n\n294\n00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:20.465\nAnd it can change over the course of a few\nyears or even the course of a few weeks.\n\n295\n00:12:20.465 --> 00:12:24.402\nAnd so that's important to kind of find\nwhat those people are strong at and\n\n296\n00:12:24.402 --> 00:12:25.554\nwhat they want to do.\n\n297\n00:12:25.554 --> 00:12:27.390\nAnd then put them in those positions.\n\n298\n00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.350\nBut any other final thoughts on\nthis topic before we move on?\n\n299\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.001\n&gt;&gt; No, I think that's it.\n\n300\n00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.357\nJust exactly what you said.\n\n301\n00:12:32.357 --> 00:12:35.925\nI think that your organization does a\ngreat job at hiring based on culture fit.\n\n302\n00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:37.660\nAnd I think that's what all\norganizations should be doing.\n\n303\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.710\nAnd that makes everything else so\nmuch easier and it just makes more sense.\n\n304\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.213\nAnd if you find somebody that's\nreally good at something,\n\n305\n00:12:44.213 --> 00:12:46.474\ndon't be scared to move\nthem into another position.\n\n306\n00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:49.354\nI mean that's how you find,\nsometimes somebody doesn't know\n\n307\n00:12:49.354 --> 00:12:52.083\nthey're really good at something or\nthey love something.\n\n308\n00:12:52.083 --> 00:12:56.263\nAnd that's how things get uncovered and\nreally come up to the forefront.\n\n309\n00:12:56.263 --> 00:12:57.745\nAnd then let's capitalize on that.\n\n310\n00:12:57.745 --> 00:13:00.726\nWhen somebody does something they really,\nreally enjoy doing,\n\n311\n00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:02.090\nthey're gonna do it so well.\n\n312\n00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.813\nAnd it's gonna be natural to them, and\n\n313\n00:13:03.813 --> 00:13:07.382\nyou're gonna see exponential growth in\nyour organization in that department.\n\n314\n00:13:07.382 --> 00:13:10.372\n&gt;&gt; Well, I know you're a millennial, so\nI wanna say you're doing a great job,\n\n315\n00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:11.387\nthis is a fantastic show.\n\n316\n00:13:11.387 --> 00:13:13.015\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Another great episode full of\n\n317\n00:13:13.015 --> 00:13:14.270\nlots of great information.\n\n318\n00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.070\nWe've got a lot more great information\ncoming your way as well, so\n\n319\n00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.021\nbe sure to stay tuned.\n\n320\n00:13:18.021 --> 00:13:19.969\nBut for\nnow signing off I am Peter VanRysdam.\n\n321\n00:13:19.969 --> 00:13:24.177\n&gt;&gt;

Peter VanRysdam, and today\nwe're continuing in our series talking\n\n4\n00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.980\nabout what Millennials are looking for\nin the workplace.\n\n5\n00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.770\nAnd here to help us we have\nthe expert who wrote the book,\n\n6\n00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.820\nMillennial Workforce, Javier Montes.\n\n7\n00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.810\nJavier, how are you doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.150\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Peter,\nthank you for having me today.\n\n9\n00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.410\nIt's a pleasure to be here talking about\nmy favorite topic which is millennials in\n\n10\n00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.440\nthe work force.\n\n11\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.290\nWe're gonna cover today\nsome amazing stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.760\nI hope you guys are ready.\n\n13\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.790\nGrab your pen and paper, take some notes.\n\n14\n00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.160\nWe're gonna dive right into it.\n\n15\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.463\nSo what we're talking about today, Peter?\n\n16\n00:00:34.463 --> 00:00:38.240\nWell, looks like we're talking about\nproviding mentorship and training which\n\n17\n00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.915\nwe've kinda talked about, acknowledging\nstrengths and things in the past.\n\n18\n00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:45.940\nAnd now we're moving on to maybe helping\nthem build upon those strengths.\n\n19\n00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.860\nSo where do we go in this one?\n\n20\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.170\n&gt;&gt; So this is one of those topics which is\nwhat millennials want in the workplace.\n\n21\n00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.400\nThis is one of those subheadings that\nyou can incorporate into your business\n\n22\n00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.640\nright away that will help\nyou increase retention and\n\n23\n00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.550\nalso attract new millenials\ninto your company.\n\n24\n00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.090\nBecause this is one of those things\nthat millenials are looking for\n\n25\n00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.860\nwhen they are deciding on\na company to work for.\n\n26\n00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.320\nThey want you to provide mentorship and\ntraining.\n\n27\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.960\nThis is key.\nAnd mentorship and training,\n\n28\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.130\nthey seem similar but\nthey're two different things, and\n\n29\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.940\nwe're gonna talk about them.\n\n30\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.560\nSo the first one let's\ntalk about is training.\n\n31\n00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.370\nI think that one's a little\nbit easier to understand.\n\n32\n00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.060\nTraining refers to basic training\non improving their skills.\n\n33\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.150\nWe talked about Millenials wanting\nto really focus on their strengths.\n\n34\n00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.040\nAnd now let's talk about giving them\ntraining to improve on these skills.\n\n35\n00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.890\nThere's a lot of companies that I talk to,\nespecially big corporate America,\n\n36\n00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.880\nFortune 1000 companies that I talk to.\n\n37\n00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.630\nThey're not spending time\ntraining their employees.\n\n38\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.240\nThey're not spending time\ntraining their new hires.\n\n39\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.570\nA lot of entrepreneur do the same thing.\n\n40\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.580\nAnd let's be frank,\nit's not really a good thing.\n\n41\n00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.960\nWe talk about training,\nI'm sure a lot of you can relate to this.\n\n42\n00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.700\nWe bring on this new hire,\nmaybe a new sales person.\n\n43\n00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.740\nWe're so excited to get them on board.\n\n44\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.720\nThey come on their first day.\n\n45\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.590\nWe give them this manual, if we have one,\nwith a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n46\n00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.030\nWe kind of throw them,\nhere go to the room.\n\n47\n00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.090\nThey lock themselves up in the room.\n\n48\n00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.190\nWe say, read the manual.\n\n49\n00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.310\nThey come back out, say all right great,\nso, you got the information,\n\n50\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.510\nyou know what our products are all about.\n\n51\n00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.610\nThey say, yeah, yeah, I learned it.\n\n52\n00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.580\nThey say, okay, great.\n\n53\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.240\nHere's a stack of leads,\nand start calling them.\n\n54\n00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.450\nWhat?\n\n55\n00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.600\nThis couldn't be farther\nfrom what should be done.\n\n56\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.520\nBut we do it all the time.\n\n57\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.533\nI understand that everybody's busy,\nI understand your managers are busy.\n\n58\n00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:34.416\nBut how will you expect your employees\nto have success in whatever role\n\n59\n00:02:34.416 --> 00:02:38.410\nyou hired them if you're\nnot giving them training.\n\n60\n00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.570\n&gt;&gt; And so, Javier, one of the things that\nI've heard though from employers is well\n\n61\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.452\nI don't want to invest in training for\nthis person because millennials,\n\n62\n00:02:44.452 --> 00:02:45.673\nthey switch jobs all the time.\n\n63\n00:02:45.673 --> 00:02:48.906\nAnd the last thing I wanna do is send\nthis guy to this conference, and\n\n64\n00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:51.481\nthis conference and\nthen have him gone in six months.\n\n65\n00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:53.954\nBut, I think what we're saying here is,\non the flip side,\n\n66\n00:02:53.954 --> 00:02:56.780\nif you don't do those things,\nthat maybe why you're losing them.\n\n67\n00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.960\nSo, it's kind of, they require\nthe training to wanna stay and\n\n68\n00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.840\nthat's what, it's kind of a catch 22.\n\n69\n00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's funny and\nit reminds me,\n\n70\n00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.160\nI have actually a quote in my book where\nwe talk about, I mentioned a meme,\n\n71\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.250\nI think it's called where I saw on social\nmedia when I was writing the book.\n\n72\n00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.420\nAnd the meme says, the CEO and\nthe CFO of a company are talking.\n\n73\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.620\nAnd the CFO tells the CEO, hey,\n\n74\n00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.970\nmaybe we shouldn't invest the money\nin training these people.\n\n75\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.320\nWhat happens if we invest the money and\nthey leave us?\n\n76\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.220\nAnd the CEO turns around and\ntells the CFO,\n\n77\n00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.600\nwell what happens if we don't and\nthey stay?\n\n78\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.790\nWhich, you know,\nputs this really into context.\n\n79\n00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.670\nRight?\n\n80\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.890\nSo yeah, I get it.\n\n81\n00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.530\nIt's a risk.\n\n82\n00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.760\nIt's always a risk.\n\n83\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.550\nEverything we do in business is a risk.\n\n84\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.400\nWhen you hired that\nperson you took a risk.\n\n85\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.350\nSo my argument is,\nif have your hiring process and\n\n86\n00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.820\nyou hired this person, you've already\nwalked out the bigger risk part.\n\n87\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.400\nYou've already taken the bigger\nstep in the journey.\n\n88\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.280\nNow what you need to do is you\nneed to train that person, and\n\n89\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.180\ngive them all the tools and the knowledge\nto be able to excel in their position.\n\n90\n00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.100\nWhy would you invest the money to hire\nsomebody then give them a half training or\n\n91\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.110\nno training at all?\n\n92\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.370\nExpect them to read a book and\nknow how to do it,\n\n93\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.930\nthat doesn't make any sense to me at all.\n\n94\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.810\nCorporate America is also prominent for\nknowing, and this was very\n\n95\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.520\npopular with previous generations, and\nnow hopefully, it's happening less.\n\n96\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.510\nBut I still see it very\nprominent in big companies,\n\n97\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.560\nwhere previous generations who have been\nwith companies for a while will tend to\n\n98\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.560\nhold down some of their employees and\nnot teach them everything.\n\n99\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.760\nYou hold them down because you're\nfearful that this new person,\n\n100\n00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.670\nthis younger person will\ntake away your job.\n\n101\n00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.060\nSo corporate America kind of created this\nenvironment where don't teach the people\n\n102\n00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.860\nunder you everything because you might\nlose your job to a younger employee.\n\n103\n00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.850\nAnd that mindset creates a very,\nvery bad culture.\n\n104\n00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.111\nIf you talked to anybody who's ever\nbeen in that receiving position,\n\n105\n00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:57.271\nthat's been held down,\n\n106\n00:04:57.271 --> 00:05:00.772\nevery single time they will tell you\nthat they were extremely frustrated.\n\n107\n00:05:00.772 --> 00:05:04.645\n9 out of 10 times they quit their jobs\nbecause they couldn't put up with it\n\n108\n00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:07.080\nanymore and\nyou're holding down your talent.\n\n109\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.850\nAnd that really comes from the culture\nthat you're creating in your environment.\n\n110\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.390\nSo what do we do?\n\n111\n00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.470\nHow do we get outside of that?\n\n112\n00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.335\nWell as leaders we need\nto put in systems and\n\n113\n00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:19.300\nprocesses that really avoid this\ntype of errors from happening.\n\n114\n00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.480\nI'll give you an example, in my company,\nvery strict from day one,\n\n115\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.100\nany single person who ever\ncomes to interview for\n\n116\n00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.570\nour position at our company, is told how\nour philosophy in our company works.\n\n117\n00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.657\nAnd the way it works in my company\nis you will never get a promotion\n\n118\n00:05:36.657 --> 00:05:43.102\nin my company until you train somebody\nto do everything that you do.\n\n119\n00:05:43.102 --> 00:05:45.780\nAnd you train somebody under you and\nbring them up to do your job.\n\n120\n00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.330\nThat mindset is kind of\nto a lot of people, and\n\n121\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.130\nsome people have a hard\ntime understanding that.\n\n122\n00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.230\nBut we create a culture where\nit is your responsibility\n\n123\n00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.430\nto coach somebody under you,\ntrain somebody under you,\n\n124\n00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.650\nteach them everything you know, all the\ntips and tricks that they can do your job.\n\n125\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.560\nAnd only when you've done\nthat will you be invited for\n\n126\n00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.430\na promotion to a better position\nin the company, a higher position.\n\n127\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.000\nBecause at that point, we know,\nI know that you coach, that you give back,\n\n128\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.560\nand that you can promote your team and\nyou can coach your team.\n\n129\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.490\nIf you don't have those abilities, and\nyou can't bring people up, you can't teach\n\n130\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.370\npeople new skills, there's no place for\nyou being promoted into our company.\n\n131\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.520\nAnd I think that culture needs to\nstart permeating throughout most of\n\n132\n00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.260\ncorporate America.\n\n133\n00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I think the key there with\nthat is to maybe do it across the board.\n\n134\n00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.870\nBecause if my boss came to me tomorrow and\nsaid that, and\n\n135\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.980\nwe'd never done that before,\nI can maybe see the writing on the wall\n\n136\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.800\nthat I should start\ngetting my resume ready.\n\n137\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.460\nBut if you know coming in that this is\nsomething that we all do and it's so\n\n138\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.660\nthat we can all work together.\n\n139\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.374\nAnd I know that you're gonna\ngo on vacation someday and\n\n140\n00:06:44.374 --> 00:06:48.571\nI'm gonna have to help you out, and that's\njust a standard way your company works.\n\n141\n00:06:48.571 --> 00:06:50.820\nThen I think they're gonna\nget onboard with it.\n\n142\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.902\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that again,\nit has to come from the leadership and\n\n143\n00:06:53.902 --> 00:06:56.484\njust make it a policy\nthroughout the entire company.\n\n144\n00:06:56.484 --> 00:07:00.746\nAnd just create that culture where\neverybody is just naturally doing it on\n\n145\n00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:01.770\ntheir own.\n\n146\n00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.875\nI don't care what position\nyou are in our company,\n\n147\n00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:08.170\nyou need to be able to find\nsomebody who can do your job.\n\n148\n00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.510\nThat's how you will get promoted,\nthat's how you will you get better.\n\n149\n00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:16.350\nThat's when I know as the business leader\nthat you have mastered what your job is.\n\n150\n00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.740\nBecause until then, I don't feel\ncomfortable that you've mastered it.\n\n151\n00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.860\nI think there's a lot of\nancient Chinese parables and\n\n152\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.270\nwhatnot that talk something about that.\n\n153\n00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.070\nBut, the master has failed more times\nthan the beginner has ever tried.\n\n154\n00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.060\nAnd you don't master something until\nyou can truly teach somebody to do it.\n\n155\n00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.850\nSo, for me, you can't ask me for\n\n156\n00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.380\na promotion until you've mastered\nwhat you're currently doing.\n\n157\n00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.650\nAnd the only way you show me that you've\nmastered it is if you've trained somebody\n\n158\n00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.680\nto fully be able to do what you do.\n\n159\n00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.230\nAnd then you can grow into a better\nposition within our company.\n\n160\n00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.230\nSo this training is exactly what we need\nto incorporate inside our companies today.\n\n161\n00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.370\n&gt;&gt; Now does training for\nmillennial any different that training for\n\n162\n00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.998\nbaby boomers or gen X?\n\n163\n00:07:53.998 --> 00:07:58.470\nIs there, we still talking about going\nto conferences or other resources for\n\n164\n00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.610\na millennial?\n\n165\n00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there is a little bit of a\ndifference, and I would break it down and\n\n166\n00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.910\nwe'll talk about this in a later segment.\n\n167\n00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:12.680\nBut the training is a little bit different\nonly in that millennials have a very short\n\n168\n00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.260\ntimeframe window and millennials are very\nreserved about their brains space.\n\n169\n00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.220\nSo millennials don't necessarily want\nto learn every single little thing.\n\n170\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.710\nThey want to learn that where they\ncan find the information, and\n\n171\n00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.300\nI think that's key.\n\n172\n00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.430\nPrevious generations I found want to learn\nthe minute details of how everything\n\n173\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.440\nworks, and\nhow to answer every single question.\n\n174\n00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.390\nAnd how to get everything before\nthey go out and do something,\n\n175\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.540\nor a particular role.\n\n176\n00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.790\nMillennials don't necessarily\nwant to know all the answers, but\n\n177\n00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.510\nthey want to know where they\ncan find all the answers.\n\n178\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.420\nVery similar to being able to\nGoogle something online and\n\n179\n00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.780\nfinding the answer,\nthey're used to that kind of mindset,\n\n180\n00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.950\nthey're used to that kind of culture,\nand they want you to teach them.\n\n181\n00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.230\nIf I get stuck during\na sales presentation,\n\n182\n00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.660\nwhere should I go find that answer?\n\n183\n00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.730\nIt's good to invest in the time and\nsaying, okay,\n\n184\n00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.680\nthese are all the possible objections,\nright?\n\n185\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.470\nBut they don't need to learn to\nmemorize every single objection.\n\n186\n00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.480\nThey just say when I get stuck,\nteach me where to go.\n\n187\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.460\n&gt;&gt; So maybe in the past if we were\ntalking about hey, I have an issue,\n\n188\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.460\nI need some help with that,\nyou might schedule a trainer to come in.\n\n189\n00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.230\nAnd that might be three, six weeks out.\n\n190\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.305\nMaybe one of the things we look for\nnow is here are some online resources, and\n\n191\n00:09:22.305 --> 00:09:26.189\nknowledge bases, or groups of other\npeople that do similar positions,\n\n192\n00:09:26.189 --> 00:09:29.394\nlike on LinkedIn, that you can find and\njoin those things.\n\n193\n00:09:29.394 --> 00:09:32.443\nSo going back to the point we talked\nabout in a previous episodes of instant\n\n194\n00:09:32.443 --> 00:09:33.190\ngratification.\n\n195\n00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.760\nIf I have a problem I can\nget an answer now, and\n\n196\n00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.620\nI'm not waiting six weeks to do my job.\n\n197\n00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n198\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:44.360\nAnd when I talk about reserve brain space,\nI was saying when I was growing up,\n\n199\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.350\nagain in the Gen X mindset,\nwe didn't have cell phones.\n\n200\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.720\nAnd the concept of like a phone book,\n\n201\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.020\nwe would pride ourselves in In memorizing\npeople's phone numbers, or having a very\n\n202\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.050\ngood little complete little black book\nwith everybody's phone numbers in it.\n\n203\n00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.930\nMillennials have no interest\nin memorizing phone numbers.\n\n204\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:03.850\nAnd that's the perfect example for\n\n205\n00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.810\nme to get you to understand that\nthat's how they reserve their brains.\n\n206\n00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.250\nThey say, why in the world would I\nmemorize people's phone numbers?\n\n207\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.410\n&gt;&gt; If I didn't have my phone and\n\n208\n00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.600\nI had to call someone,\nI don't know what would happen.\n\n209\n00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.872\nI think I would be able to call my\nparents, and that's about the end of it.\n\n210\n00:10:17.872 --> 00:10:19.756\nYeah, but before cell phones and\n\n211\n00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:23.792\nbefore this kind of information was\nreadily available to us all the time\n\n212\n00:10:23.792 --> 00:10:27.907\nbecause we can find our phone numbers\nin our cell phone whenever we want.\n\n213\n00:10:27.907 --> 00:10:32.709\nBut before that was the case we would fill\nour brain, whatever brain capacity we\n\n214\n00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:36.530\nhad available we would fill\na lot of it with phone numbers.\n\n215\n00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.250\nBecause that's just how we wired.\n\n216\n00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.480\nMillenials are so keen to say why would I\nput all those phone numbers in my head?\n\n217\n00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.710\nDoesn't make any sense.\n\n218\n00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.600\nThey want to know, okay, so\nto get that information,\n\n219\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.230\nto get those phone numbers, I go to my\ncell phone and I have it all there.\n\n220\n00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.820\nI go to my contacts in my Outlook and\nmy Gmail or wherever and\n\n221\n00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.610\nI can access that information.\n\n222\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.260\nVery, very,\nsimilar to explain about the training.\n\n223\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.700\nWe don't need to give\nthem all the answers.\n\n224\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.830\nWe need to go over some basic things,\nbasic skills,\n\n225\n00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.950\ndo some role play, train them correctly.\n\n226\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.690\nAnd then teach them, say if you get stuck\nthis is where you go for the resources.\n\n227\n00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.200\nEither a group, an online resource, and we\nneed to invest the time in creating those.\n\n228\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.130\nAnd the second part of it real quick,\nis going to be the mentorship.\n\n229\n00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.390\nSo we talked a lot about training.\n\n230\n00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.305\nMentorship is very close to training.\n\n231\n00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:24.445\nHowever it is actually having kind\nof like a partner, or group, or\n\n232\n00:11:24.445 --> 00:11:25.982\na program in your company.\n\n233\n00:11:25.982 --> 00:11:27.760\nAs someone within the company.\n\n234\n00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.309\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, within the company\n\n235\n00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:32.715\nthat can give that millennial mentorship.\n\n236\n00:11:32.715 --> 00:11:35.549\nAnd when we talked about it,\nit's just kind of a form of training but\n\n237\n00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:37.155\nit's an important part of training.\n\n238\n00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.085\nMillennials want to be developed.\n\n239\n00:11:39.085 --> 00:11:42.010\nMillennials want to follow a leader.\n\n240\n00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.490\nAnd they want a mentor to\nteach them those things.\n\n241\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.470\nSo, I highly recommend,\nin our company we do it,\n\n242\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.590\nnew hires always are assigned\nsomebody that they can learn from.\n\n243\n00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:56.890\nMost companies, you wanna put your new\nhires right next to your best performer.\n\n244\n00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.550\nYou don't put them down to the lowest\nperformer because he's the least busy.\n\n245\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.870\nNo, you put him next to the best\nperformer, any new hire, millennial or\n\n246\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.420\nnot because you want him to learn\nthe skills, the abilities and\n\n247\n00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.670\nthe habits that your\ntop performer is doing.\n\n248\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:13.080\nYou can't put him next to the guy that\nis less busy because he has more time,\n\n249\n00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.640\nthat just makes absolutely no sense.\n\n250\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.060\nHe is going to learn the bad habits,\n\n251\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.140\nhe is going to learn the things that\nmake this person your bottom performer.\n\n252\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.560\nSo if you want to be the best\nperformer team them up with a mentor\n\n253\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.550\nthat gets the results that you want.\n\n254\n00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.050\nYour top performer that's who need\nto be paired up with all your hires\n\n255\n00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:28.930\nincluding millennials.\n\n256\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.180\nAnd millennials really create\nthat kind of mentorship.\n\n257\n00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.820\nThey want that kind of relationship.\n\n258\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.704\nAgain, it's about building\nthe relationships at work,\n\n259\n00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:36.364\nit's about being friends\nwith your co-workers.\n\n260\n00:12:36.364 --> 00:12:40.113\nThis mentorship allows them to connect\non a a different level about learning\n\n261\n00:12:40.113 --> 00:12:43.160\nthe same material, so\nit's not just going to a class.\n\n262\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.260\nGet them to a class,\nthen team them up with somebody or\n\n263\n00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.060\nin a group where they can\nhave this kind of mentorship.\n\n264\n00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.630\nAnd that's gonna set your\nmillenials up for success.\n\n265\n00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.530\nAnd that's one of the things that they're\nlooking for in the workplace today.\n\n266\n00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.470\n&gt;&gt; And a mentor can not only help\nyou with those specific job skills.\n\n267\n00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.974\nBut also when you come to a new\ncompany there's processes and\n\n268\n00:12:58.974 --> 00:13:00.560\nprocedures to figure out.\n\n269\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.110\nAnd it's great to have that person to go\nto that's been there for a few years, and\n\n270\n00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.290\ncan really help guide you\nin your new position.\n\n271\n00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.460\nSo I think that's a great point for\nus to go ahead and cut off,\n\n272\n00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.710\nunless you've got some\nmore information here.\n\n273\n00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.460\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\nno that's pretty much it all right there.\n\n274\n00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.197\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\nAll right so\n\n275\n00:13:14.197 --> 00:13:16.393\nwe've got a lot more great\ncontent in the book to cover,\n\n276\n00:13:16.393 --> 00:13:17.669\na lot more episodes after this.\n\n277\n00:13:17.669 --> 00:13:21.470\nSo be sure to stay tuned, but for\nnow signing off, I'm Peter VanRysdam.\n\n278\n00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.510\n&gt;&gt; And\nI'm Javier Montez your millennial expert.\n\n279\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.706\nSee you at the next episode.\n\n280\n00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:35.706\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I'm doing fantastic Peter,\nthank you very much for having me.\n\n10\n00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.420\nPleasure to be here again,\ntalking about my favorite topic,\n\n11\n00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.850\nmillennials in the workforce.\n\n12\n00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.235\n&gt;&gt; And I know today we've got a unique\none we're talking about the work place\n\n13\n00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:36.055\nenvironment itself and what that looks\nlike, so where do we start on that.\n\n14\n00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:40.187\n&gt;&gt; So a topic we're gonna talk about\ntoday is what millennials are looking for\n\n15\n00:00:40.187 --> 00:00:41.245\nin the workplace.\n\n16\n00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:46.495\nThe topic for today is going to be they\nwant a collaborative work environment.\n\n17\n00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:50.154\n&gt;&gt; Now are we talking about those\nkinda open rooms where everyone's in\n\n18\n00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:51.062\nthe same place?\n\n19\n00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:55.313\nOr are you saying more places where\nthey can go to meeting rooms and\n\n20\n00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:57.250\nget together or both?\n\n21\n00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.600\n&gt;&gt; A little of both, I think when I wrote\nthis portion of the book, I'm really\n\n22\n00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.350\nreferring to a team oriented kind of\nculture that really works together.\n\n23\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.330\nWhat I've found in big\ncorporate America is that,\n\n24\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.370\naside from the departments really\nseparating the company itself,\n\n25\n00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.860\na lot of the departments themselves inside\nthe departments are a little disconnected.\n\n26\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.630\nAnd I think that people\nare working on things,\n\n27\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.590\nbut they're not necessarily\nworking on things together.\n\n28\n00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.639\nAnd a lot of companies they\nput people in cubicles and\n\n29\n00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:31.143\nthey expect them to\njust work on their own.\n\n30\n00:01:31.143 --> 00:01:35.300\nBecause big corporate America previous\ngenerational thinking has conditioned\n\n31\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.233\nthem to believe that if they're\ntalking to their peers or\n\n32\n00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:43.330\nif they're with their peers, that they're\ndistracted and they're not producing.\n\n33\n00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.840\nSo what's happened is that\nmillennials are looking for\n\n34\n00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.870\na work environment where\nthey can collaborate with\n\n35\n00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.930\nteams within their organization that\nwork together to produce a common good.\n\n36\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.720\nAnd I think that millennials right now\nare really seeking that in the workplace.\n\n37\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.640\nThey want a company that really promotes\nthis type of culture where we work\n\n38\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.630\ntogether, we can collaborate on teams just\nlike we did when we were in school to\n\n39\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.760\nreally put together these amazing\nprojects and have amazing results.\n\n40\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.711\nI think the concept of the greater,\nI think the saying is,\n\n41\n00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:20.740\nthe sum of its parts is-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n42\n00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.760\ngreater than the sums of its parts, yeah.\n\n43\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.140\n&gt;&gt; The collective of all of us is greater\nthan the sum of all of our efforts,\n\n44\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.430\nbasically, right?\n\n45\n00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.262\nSo what that means to say is that one,\nplus one, plus one,\n\n46\n00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:34.550\nplus one is not necessarily four.\n\n47\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.199\nBut one, plus one, plus one,\nplus one is probably ten, or 40, right?\n\n48\n00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.350\nThat concept, millennials are very,\nvery clear on that.\n\n49\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.320\nThey understand that just\nbecause I can produce one,\n\n50\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.060\nthe four of us together we're gonna\nproduce way more than four, right?\n\n51\n00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.330\nThat concept is really key, and\n\n52\n00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.300\nthey're looking to really collaborate\nwith teams inside our organizations.\n\n53\n00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.870\nThey want this team environment.\n\n54\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.560\nSo in essence,\nthey don't want to win individually,\n\n55\n00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.040\nI think it's a big difference, right?\n\n56\n00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.850\nPrevious generations were all about me,\nme, me, me, and I want to win\n\n57\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.030\nindividually, and it's all about me and\nI'm trying to win the big prize.\n\n58\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.930\nmillennials are more focused on,\nhow can we win as a team?\n\n59\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.062\nHow can we win as a department?\n\n60\n00:03:12.062 --> 00:03:13.620\nHow can we win as a company?\n\n61\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.460\nBecause we're part of\nthis collaborative unit.\n\n62\n00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.885\n&gt;&gt; And I remember the first time I\ntoured one of these open offices\n\n63\n00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:24.185\nyears ago here in Florida, and\nmy question was, isn't it distracting?\n\n64\n00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:27.612\nYou got this guy talking and this guy\ntalking, and does that get in your head?\n\n65\n00:03:27.612 --> 00:03:28.395\nAnd they said,\n\n66\n00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:32.640\nyou know what we've found is we have\nwhat they called creative collisions.\n\n67\n00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.752\nWhich is basically, two people might be\nhaving a conversation, and this guy can\n\n68\n00:03:35.752 --> 00:03:38.849\nhear it, but this guy might have something\nto add that they didn't know about.\n\n69\n00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.100\nOr hey, you know I've been working on that\nall day too, I can help you out with that.\n\n70\n00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.070\nOr no, we've already got this done,\nlet me show you.\n\n71\n00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.857\nAnd those things aren't gonna happen\nif you're going in someone's office\n\n72\n00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:51.520\nto have this conversation, and\nit's not public and you can't hear it.\n\n73\n00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.329\nSo I think it's a great\nway to get collaboration\n\n74\n00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.868\nif you didn't even know you were missing.\n\n75\n00:03:56.868 --> 00:04:01.479\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely, and\nagain this goes back to the leadership,and\n\n76\n00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.926\nreally leaning on the leadership\nto put together these teams and\n\n77\n00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:11.467\nencourage the team to really get together\nand contribute to the overall cause.\n\n78\n00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:13.591\nIn leadership, the management team and\n\n79\n00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:17.970\nthe companies has to promote this culture\nof let's get together and put together.\n\n80\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.455\nLike brainstorming sessions are a great\nidea, a common work space is a great idea.\n\n81\n00:04:22.455 --> 00:04:27.345\nAnd really facilitating the spaces\nin your office to be able to\n\n82\n00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:29.535\ncreate this team environment is critical.\n\n83\n00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:33.930\nWe talk about companies like Google who\nhave beanbags in their offices, and\n\n84\n00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.600\nthey have these what I call them culture\nrooms where it's all about their culture.\n\n85\n00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.980\nAnd they can kind of just hang out and\nreally elaborate.\n\n86\n00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.390\nThey have brainstorming rooms with\nwhiteboard paint on the walls and\n\n87\n00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.080\nthey just write crazy ideas.\n\n88\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.925\nAnd that kind of environment\nreally allows the millennials and\n\n89\n00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:54.010\nnon-millennials to throw ideas out.\n\n90\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.970\nAnd it's a safe space, nothing's wrong.\n\n91\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.750\nThere's no stupid ideas here.\n\n92\n00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.050\nBecause that is what triggers\ninnovative thinking and\n\n93\n00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.430\nthat's what moves our society forward.\n\n94\n00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.360\nAnd that's what can really trigger\nour corporations, our companies,\n\n95\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.380\nour entrepreneurs to really expand and\n\n96\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.670\nreally be able to create amazing\nthings that we haven't thought about,\n\n97\n00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.280\nif we allow for\nthat type of collaboration.\n\n98\n00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.837\n&gt;&gt; Now this sounds a little bit like it\ncould go, or kind of flying in the face of\n\n99\n00:05:19.837 --> 00:05:23.112\nsomething we talked about in\na previous episode of telecommuting and\n\n100\n00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:26.725\nsomething that's important for a lot\nof millennial's to be able to work may\n\n101\n00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:29.908\nbe a little different schedules or\na little different locations.\n\n102\n00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:33.555\nBut we can still create team environments\neven when we telecommute through apps and\n\n103\n00:05:33.555 --> 00:05:35.380\nthings like that, is that right?\n\n104\n00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah of course, I mean there's so\nmuch technology out there right now,\n\n105\n00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.980\nyou can still create\nthat team environment.\n\n106\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.365\nI know a lot of companies who have remote\npeople who work in different parts\n\n107\n00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:44.450\nof the country, and\nwe still come together.\n\n108\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.475\nI mean, there's a lot of companies that\ndo this, I call them a daily huddle,\n\n109\n00:05:47.475 --> 00:05:49.650\nsome people call them a daily stand-up.\n\n110\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.950\nAnd you really create alignment as a team,\nright?\n\n111\n00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.580\nThere's so many other companies\nthat I go and I visit,\n\n112\n00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.690\nand I talk to and\nthe team never comes together.\n\n113\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.680\nThe team never aligns on\nwhat they're doing or\n\n114\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.745\nwhat they're trying to accomplish.\n\n115\n00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:04.978\nSo you get again what we talked\nabout in a previous episode, you get\n\n116\n00:06:04.978 --> 00:06:08.808\npeople pulling in different directions and\nthe alignment's just not there.\n\n117\n00:06:08.808 --> 00:06:09.588\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We're trying\n\n118\n00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:12.110\nto move the ship in one direction,\nthe captain, the CEO,\n\n119\n00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.140\nthe entrepreneur, the leader is\nsaying hey, we're gonna go that way.\n\n120\n00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.600\nBut the rest of the team either doesn't\nhear it, and they say well, I'm working\n\n121\n00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.740\nreally fast, I'm working really fast, but\nif you're pulling the opposite way of\n\n122\n00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.620\nthe rest of the team,\nwell we can't get anywhere, right?\n\n123\n00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.220\nYou're pulling against\nwhere we're trying to go.\n\n124\n00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.140\nSo the alignment is so critical just\nto move forward an organization.\n\n125\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.670\nThe bigger a company gets,\n\n126\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.190\nthe bigger an organization gets\nthe more challenging that becomes.\n\n127\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.110\nBecause it's very easy to create team\nmembers that start disconnecting,\n\n128\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.180\ndepartments that start disconnecting.\n\n129\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.326\nYou need really, really strong ties, and\n\n130\n00:06:43.326 --> 00:06:46.496\nstrong systems and\nprocesses to really keep the team aligned.\n\n131\n00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:49.065\nAnd I think that millennials\nare really looking for\n\n132\n00:06:49.065 --> 00:06:51.941\na company that embodies this\nteam environment, right?\n\n133\n00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:54.670\nPutting it out there with your\ncore values is very important.\n\n134\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.660\nAnd, when a millennial joins a team,\nand they come on board,\n\n135\n00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.360\nthey want to feel like\nthey're part of a team.\n\n136\n00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.354\nThey don't want to feel like,\ni'm just one person in this company.\n\n137\n00:07:02.354 --> 00:07:06.841\nYeah I do a job, yes I have purpose or\nwhatever, but i'm alone, I'm stuck in\n\n138\n00:07:06.841 --> 00:07:10.652\na cubicle and I wanna collaborate\nwith somebody that I work with.\n\n139\n00:07:10.652 --> 00:07:14.142\nBut when I try to, the boss comes in and\ntells me, hey what are you doing,\n\n140\n00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:17.290\nwhy are you guys you know talking so\nmuch or what not, right?\n\n141\n00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.610\nThat kind of environment is\nnot conducive for millennials.\n\n142\n00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.060\nI would say it's not conducive for\nany generation as well.\n\n143\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.337\nBut previous generations have\nhad these blinders on and say,\n\n144\n00:07:26.337 --> 00:07:29.865\nthis is the way that it needs to be\nbecause if you deviate from that,\n\n145\n00:07:29.865 --> 00:07:32.023\nthen your team is not being productive.\n\n146\n00:07:32.023 --> 00:07:35.651\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and even if you are in separate\nspaces, either geographically or\n\n147\n00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:39.990\nyou're in an environment where they have\nwalls and you can't break them down.\n\n148\n00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.000\nStaying, communicating with things\nlike Skype, things like Slack.\n\n149\n00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.680\nI've even seen teams on video together\nin Google hangouts throughout the day,\n\n150\n00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.340\neven though they're spread out across\nthe country or across the world.\n\n151\n00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.100\nAnd so that's definitely\nimportant to get that atmosphere,\n\n152\n00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.710\nregardless of how your company is set up.\n\n153\n00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.246\nBut any other final thoughts on\nthis topic before we move on?\n\n154\n00:07:56.246 --> 00:08:00.144\n&gt;&gt; Nope, just being collaborative and\ncreating that team environment, right?\n\n155\n00:08:00.144 --> 00:08:02.208\nTeam, I mean I use the acronym\nall the time at my company,\n\n156\n00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:03.820\ntogether everyone achieves more.\n\n157\n00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.340\nI also use that there's no I in team.\n\n158\n00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.071\nWe use that and we talk about it a lot.\n\n159\n00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:11.124\nAnd that's critical, just keep that in\nmind when it comes to millennials, and\n\n160\n00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:13.152\nkeep it in mind when it comes\nto your team in general.\n\n161\n00:08:13.152 --> 00:08:17.005\nI think everybody in an organisation,\nregardless of what generation they're from\n\n162\n00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:20.110\nwill really find value when you\ncan create that harmony, and\n\n163\n00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.230\nthat sense of belonging to\nsomething bigger than yourself.\n\n164\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.465\n&gt;&gt; What was that team acronym again?\n\n165\n00:08:24.465 --> 00:08:27.329\nCuz that was a lot easier than\nthe sum of your parts equals the-\n\n166\n00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:28.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, team, team,\n\n167\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.680\ntogether, everyone achieves more.\n\n168\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.430\n&gt;&gt; That's great, and I think that's\nkinda the whole point there.\n\n169\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.448\nSo great information on that one, and\n\n170\n00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:39.622\nI know we've got a lot more information\nto cover in some future episodes here.\n\n171\n00:08:39.622 --> 00:08:40.930\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n172\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.070\nI'm Peter VanRysdam.\n\n173\n00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.130\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Javier Montes,\nyour millennial expert.\n\n174\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.905\nSee you next episode.\n\n175\n00:08:44.905 --> 00:08:46.091\nBye-bye.\n\n176\n00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:55.354\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Peter VanRysdam and\n\n4\n00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.990\ntoday we're continuing in our series\nabout what Millennials are looking for\n\n5\n00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.510\nin the work place, specifically, we have a\ngreat episode right now about having fun.\n\n6\n00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.150\nI'm really excited to talk about this and\nhere to help us and understand\n\n7\n00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.745\nhow we have fun professionally is the man\nwho wrote the book Millennial Workforce,\n\n8\n00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:24.850\nJavier Montes, Javier, how you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.170\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Peter.\n\n10\n00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.560\nThank you very much for\nhaving me on the show.\n\n11\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.480\nI'm excited to chat with\nyou today a little bit.\n\n12\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.270\nWe're gonna talk about my favorite topic.\n\n13\n00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.480\nGuess what that is?\n\n14\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.730\n&gt;&gt; Fun, I hope.\n\n15\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.910\n&gt;&gt; Close, it's about Millenials.\n\n16\n00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.210\n&gt;&gt; Millenials.\nCome on, we're [INAUDIBLE] away.\n\n17\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.440\nFun with Millenials.\n\n18\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.890\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n19\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.910\n&gt;&gt; You were like half right.\n\n20\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So what do we mean when we say,\nlet me have fun.\n\n21\n00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.370\n&gt;&gt; So this concept is like what do\nMillennial's want in the workplace?\n\n22\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.950\nWhat are they looking for\nwhen deciding on a place to work?\n\n23\n00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.160\nAnd one of the things that they\nare looking for, is they want to have fun.\n\n24\n00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.730\nThey want a company that lets them and\nencourages them to have fun.\n\n25\n00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.180\nSo this concept,\nit's pretty self explanatory.\n\n26\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.990\nBut I think what we're going to talk\nabout today is really how can we\n\n27\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.610\nincorporate that into our\nprofessional work environment.\n\n28\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.310\nI think that's the challenge that I\nget from most entrepreneur, right?\n\n29\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.825\nWe say, yeah, we'd love to make our work\nfun, but we got a we got to deal with,\n\n30\n00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:19.585\nwe have a challenge, because we\nstill need people to be serious.\n\n31\n00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:23.345\nI can't have people just going crazy and\nrunning amuck.\n\n32\n00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:25.585\nSo, how do we incorporate\nfun into the workplace?\n\n33\n00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.245\nI think that's the challenge, so\nlet's address that right now.\n\n34\n00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:31.075\nSo, Millennials,\nwhy do they wanna have fun at work?\n\n35\n00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:34.210\nI mean,\nbesides the obvious reason of having fun\n\n36\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.430\nwe gotta remember that Millennials\nhave their personal life and\n\n37\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.370\ntheir work like intertwined\ninto one thing, right?\n\n38\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.530\nSo if it's one thing, just we can think\nabout, it's their one life, and they want\n\n39\n00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.000\nto make sure that their priority is taken\ncare of, and their priority is happiness.\n\n40\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.080\nThey want to enjoy life now.\n\n41\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.030\nRemember, Millennials don't want\nto wait to enjoy life later on,\n\n42\n00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.290\nthey wanna enjoy it right now.\n\n43\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.430\nThe experience that they're\ngetting while working for\n\n44\n00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.840\nour company, they want it to be fun\nbecause that's their life, it's one life.\n\n45\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.430\nThere's no personal life and\nwork life, right?\n\n46\n00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.130\nThey don't have this segregation of\nin my personal life I have fun, and\n\n47\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.690\nthen in my work life it's\nokay not to have fun.\n\n48\n00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.810\nIt's one thing for them.\n\n49\n00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.220\nSo in their mindset,\nit's let's just enjoy life.\n\n50\n00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.900\nLet's have fun.\n\n51\n00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.800\nLet's enjoy it.\n\n52\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.730\nSo part of that is enjoying\nnaturally what you're doing.\n\n53\n00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.370\nBut the other part is,\nare we creating a culture in our companies\n\n54\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.510\nwhere our team can enjoy and\nhave a little bit of fun?\n\n55\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.680\nAll right.\nSo how can we do that?\n\n56\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.550\nLet's talk about some ideas.\n\n57\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.950\nSo I'll talk about some personal\nexperiences on what we do in our company,\n\n58\n00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.370\non how we incorporate fun.\n\n59\n00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.000\nSo one of the things that we do in\nour company is birthdays, right?\n\n60\n00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.180\nBirthdays are a huge\ncelebration at my company.\n\n61\n00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.990\nI mean, we talk almost an entire\nday to almost disconnect\n\n62\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.400\nfrom everything we do whenever\nsomebody celebrates a birthday.\n\n63\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.410\nNow, as your company gets bigger you\ncan do it per person, but you may take\n\n64\n00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.730\none day in your company or half a day to\ncelebrate all the birthdays in that month.\n\n65\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.550\nYou can do something like that.\n\n66\n00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.010\nNow, what would\na celebration in our company\n\n67\n00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.280\nlook like when somebody\ncelebrates a birthday.\n\n68\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.830\nWell, first thing is we try\nto catch them off guard.\n\n69\n00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.890\nHow do we catch them off guard?\n\n70\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.170\nWell, if you're celebrating a birthday on\nThursday, maybe we'll start celebrating on\n\n71\n00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.930\nWednesday, maybe we'll\nsurprise you on Tuesday.\n\n72\n00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.980\nSometimes well be really evil and\nwe'll do it on Friday,\n\n73\n00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.200\nmake you think we forgot your birthday,\nright?\n\n74\n00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.320\nSo we'll do things like that,\nthat kind of makes it a little fun.\n\n75\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.650\nSo you get surprised on your birthday.\n\n76\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.060\nSo what kind of surprise do you get?\n\n77\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.650\nWell, when you walk into the office,\nguess what happens?\n\n78\n00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.130\nEverybody starts screaming and\ncheering and\n\n79\n00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.370\nwe play loud music when\nyou walk into the office.\n\n80\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.550\nEverybody is saying happy birthday, and\nimmediately after we start cheering and\n\n81\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.285\nscreaming, guess what?\n\n82\n00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:30.850\nSomebody's coming out from the kitchen\nwith a birthday cake, candles lit.\n\n83\n00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.430\nNow, typically are not regular candles,\n\n84\n00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.670\ntypically we have these firework\ncandles that are super huge.\n\n85\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.365\nYou have seen them on TV all the time.\n\n86\n00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:38.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So something crazy like that that you\n\n87\n00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.150\ncan't blow out,\nthen we sing happy birthday.\n\n88\n00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.870\nAfter that,\nthe person walks to their desk.\n\n89\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.900\nThe desk is typically decorated with all\nkinds of confetti and all kinds of crazy\n\n90\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.050\nstuff, streamers hanging from the ceiling,\nstreamers hanging from their chairs.\n\n91\n00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.200\nI mean it's just a really fun and\nfestive time.\n\n92\n00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.780\nWe typically spend maybe a little morning\ntime kind of doing a little bit of work,\n\n93\n00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.830\ncatching up, kind of wrapping up.\n\n94\n00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.190\nBut we understand that when lunch time\ncomes around, we're pretty much gonna\n\n95\n00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.730\ndisconnect from there to the rest of\nthe day, I mean that's just our company.\n\n96\n00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.150\nAnd what do we do?\n\n97\n00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.210\nThen we'll typically go and find some\nlunch, go out to eat somewhere or\n\n98\n00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.740\nwe'll order lunch in, typically what\nthat person's favorite food is.\n\n99\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.580\nAnd then from there, we'll go to an\noffsite and do some kind of fun activity.\n\n100\n00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.090\nA fun activity we could talk about,\nwe'd go bowling, we go skating.\n\n101\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.000\nWe do things that are typically gonna\nbe kinda team building activities, but\n\n102\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.010\nat the same time it's fun.\n\n103\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.950\nWe're there to disconnect.\n\n104\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.350\nWe're there to have fun and\ncelebrate somebody's birthday.\n\n105\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.260\nAnd again, these are the kind of things\nwhich we incorporate into our company\n\n106\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.560\nbecause part of our core values\nin my company is have fun.\n\n107\n00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when we talk about the family\natmosphere of the company nowadays and\n\n108\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.850\nthat's something you do as a family.\n\n109\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.290\nYou celebrate birthdays and\n\n110\n00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.020\nit's not something you do at work\nin the old way of doing things.\n\n111\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.188\nAnd maybe the birthday thing\nisn't the right thing for\n\n112\n00:04:50.188 --> 00:04:53.342\nyour company like you said, it could be\ntoo many people or something like that,\n\n113\n00:04:53.342 --> 00:04:55.830\nbut find those things that\nyou can do that are fun.\n\n114\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's just\nan example of what works, right?\n\n115\n00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.950\nI think that everything that we've\ntalked about, everything that we talk\n\n116\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.410\nabout in my book, really revolves around\nwhat's right for your company, right?\n\n117\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.840\nWhat's your culture like?\n\n118\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.100\nWhat does your culture call for\nfor your culture?\n\n119\n00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.270\nIt has to stay true to you.\n\n120\n00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.340\nThese things can't be forced, they can't\nbe faked because then you'll lose theme.\n\n121\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.010\nIt's immediately ineffective.\n\n122\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.200\nSo just think about ideas of\nwhat you can incorporate into\n\n123\n00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.171\nyour company that'll be fun.\n\n124\n00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:23.500\nI mean I'll give you another example,\n\n125\n00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.230\njust to be kinda quick on what\nother ideas you can incorporate.\n\n126\n00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.740\nSo we have our weekly meeting.\n\n127\n00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.960\nWe've talked about that.\n\n128\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.050\nAnd at our weekly meeting, there's a part\nof our meeting where we get an opportunity\n\n129\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.980\nto recognize one of our team members for\nsomething that they've done.\n\n130\n00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.370\nNow typically in our company what we have\nto do is during that recognition is peer\n\n131\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.570\nto peer recognition.\n\n132\n00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.760\nYou could recognize somebody who's\ndone something to help you, but\n\n133\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.070\nit has to be tied to\none of our core values.\n\n134\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.980\nSo you say, well Peter you exemplified\nour core value of live by excellence and\n\n135\n00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.070\nPeter did this by helping me,\nthis, this, or that.\n\n136\n00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.680\nAnd he really went above and beyond for\nour client and made XYZ happen.\n\n137\n00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.380\nAll right, everybody.\n\n138\n00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.010\nCheers.\nWay to go, Peter.\n\n139\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.700\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; And now comes the fun.\n\n140\n00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.470\nThe fun comes in that we give\nevery time you get recognized for\n\n141\n00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.750\none of our core values you come\nup to the front of the room.\n\n142\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.910\nWe have a basketball hoop\nwith a basketball and\n\n143\n00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.050\nyou get to take a shot\nin the basketball hoop.\n\n144\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.560\nNow if you do make a shot in\nthe basketball hoop we give\n\n145\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.840\nyou a $10 gas card.\n\n146\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.310\nThey get recognized twice,\nyou get two shots.\n\n147\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.810\nYou make it both times,\nyou get $20 in gas cards.\n\n148\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.470\nAnd everybody who gets recognized every\nsingle week, gets an opportunity to go up\n\n149\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.910\nto the basketball hop, and\neverybody cheers him on.\n\n150\n00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.970\nEverybody gets excited\nwhen Peter would go up and\n\n151\n00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.140\nmake it, everybody gets even more\nexcited because he just won.\n\n152\n00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.970\nAgain, creating that family unit,\ncreating that fun activity, creating that\n\n153\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.560\nkind of culture inside your company\nis what Millennials are looking for.\n\n154\n00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.780\nAside from that everybody on your team\nwill enjoy having more fun at work.\n\n155\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.940\nIt's a fun activity, it's a team building\nactivity and Peter you couldn't have said\n\n156\n00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.610\nit better, but It's family right\nthis is what we do with family.\n\n157\n00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.720\nIn your house you celebrate birthdays,\n\n158\n00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.440\nright, why not do it with\nyour family at work right?\n\n159\n00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.660\nI mean, maybe it doesn't need\nto be as much as ours, but\n\n160\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.760\nyou should have some kind of recognition\nfor your team it's a birthday.\n\n161\n00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.550\nMaybe that doesn't work for\nyour culture, that's fine.\n\n162\n00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.120\nCelebrate a win, get creative,\n\n163\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.650\nI mean there's different things\nthat can happen in every company.\n\n164\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.360\nI've heard one company I recently visit,\nthey do something,\n\n165\n00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.170\nI think it was called like beer 30 or\n\n166\n00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.710\nFridays around 4:30 in the afternoon\nI mean they would have like beer.\n\n167\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.630\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like an amazing plan.\n\n168\n00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, that's crazy right?\n\n169\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.020\nWho does that?\n\n170\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.780\nI know, HR people cover your ears,\nI know how it is.\n\n171\n00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.950\nTrust me.\nI deal with HR people all the time.\n\n172\n00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.270\nYou don't want to hear\nthose kind of things.\n\n173\n00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.060\nJust cover your ears, but\nthat kind of stuff is fun.\n\n174\n00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.950\nThat kind of stuff creates an environment\nand if it's true to your culture,\n\n175\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.040\nif it's true to the way\nthat your team operates and\n\n176\n00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.040\nyour team will naturally\nenjoy that then why not?\n\n177\n00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.310\nLet them have fun.\n\n178\n00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.500\nThat's what Millennials want, and\n\n179\n00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.340\nI guarantee the rest of your\nteam will want the same thing.\n\n180\n00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.660\n&gt;&gt; And\nI know what you might be thinking of, hey,\n\n181\n00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.280\nyou're taking the whole afternoon off?\n\n182\n00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.280\nAll the productivity that\nthat's getting rid of.\n\n183\n00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.230\nBut when you've got this family\nenvironment, and you've got people that\n\n184\n00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.040\nhonestly care about each other, then\nthey're gonna work harder for each other.\n\n185\n00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.390\nThey're more accountable to each other,\nand\n\n186\n00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.140\nthat return is gonna come back ten fold.\n\n187\n00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.190\n&gt;&gt; Yep, definitely, every single time.\n\n188\n00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.270\nYou can make the argument, well,\nwe lose so much productivity.\n\n189\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.060\nI think my team, honestly, comes back and\n\n190\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.780\nthey're more productive because\nthey don't wanna lose that.\n\n191\n00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.830\nThose type of perks,\nthey don't wanna lose that.\n\n192\n00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.610\nThey have a sense of ownership\nof what they're responsible

strive to create\n\n201\n00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.530\nin our companies today.\n\n202\n00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.090\nIf you wanna attract not only Millennials,\nbut\n\n203\n00:08:49.090 -->

I'm doing fantastic Peter,\nthank you for having me.\n\n9\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.560\nIt's always a pleasure to be here with\nyou, thank you again for having me and\n\n10\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.680\ntalking about my favorite topic in\nthe world right now, Millennials.\n\n11\n00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.510\n&gt;&gt; I knew it that time, it is just\nMillennials, they're your favorite topic.\n\n12\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.740\nAnd today we're talking about how to\nlead Millennials in this episode.\n\n13\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.550\nSo what do you mean when you say provide,\nwhat do say,\n\n14\n00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.400\nprovide leadership not management.\n\n15\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Peter, so this a great concept,\nand this is what I talk about\n\n16\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.030\nin our chapter in the book about what\ndo Millennials want in the workplace.\n\n17\n00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.890\nSo what are Millennials exactly looking\nfor when choosing a company to work for?\n\n18\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.970\nAnd this topic dives into providing\nleadership, and not management.\n\n19\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.860\nLike what's the difference?\n\n20\n00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.475\nWhat is it that we're doing differently\nwhen we lead verses when we manage?\n\n21\n00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:07.080\nAnd this is not a new concept,\n\n22\n00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.220\nthis is a concept that's been around for\nyears and years and years.\n\n23\n00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.140\nI think I first heard of this concept\nfrom Jack Welsh, right, from GE.\n\n24\n00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.080\nI think he's the first one to kind\nof really talk about this concept.\n\n25\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.080\nAnd for many,\n\n26\n00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.820\nmany years I think corporate America has\nlead with this concept of management.\n\n27\n00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.300\nAnd it's easy to see just in titles,\nright, so we have managers, and\n\n28\n00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.150\nmid level managers, and\njust the title itself has led to,\n\n29\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.700\nlead us to think that\nwe're currently managing.\n\n30\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.580\nLike now coming into what I call the newer\ntimes, the future you see more and\n\n31\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.130\nmore titles coming around like team lead.\n\n32\n00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.440\nRight, program lead, right,\n\n33\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.740\nthis concept of leading really needs to\nbe injected into our companies today.\n\n34\n00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.720\nSo what's the difference, right?\n\n35\n00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.930\nLet's talk about that, so management,\nI think Jack Welsh talked about it.\n\n36\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.420\nAnd the way I like to define management\nversus leading is managers tell and\n\n37\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.270\nleaders show, right.\n\n38\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.810\nSo, a manager tells\nsomebody to do something,\n\n39\n00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.670\na leader will show somebody\nhow to do something, right.\n\n40\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.200\nA leader leads by example,\na manager tells people what to do and\n\n41\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.100\nnot necessarily does it themselves.\n\n42\n00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.710\nAnd I think Millennials are really,\nreally keen on this.\n\n43\n00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.330\nAnd they really want to be provided that\nleadership, not necessarily be managed,\n\n44\n00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.910\nand this goes down into\nmicromanaging as well.\n\n45\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.320\nThis goes down into really trying\nto get control of your team versus\n\n46\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.960\nbeing the leader that your team looks\nup to and wants to follow and be like.\n\n47\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.360\nAnd I think that's\nthe biggest difference there.\n\n48\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and a term I've heard recently too\nespecially in the IT world where we're\n\n49\n00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.460\ntalking about agile, work environments\nis the leader is a servant leader.\n\n50\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.220\nSo they're more saying what can I\ndo to help you do your job better,\n\n51\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.580\nwhat obstacles can I\ntake out of your way so\n\n52\n00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.700\nthat you can do your job\nas efficiently as possible?\n\n53\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.960\nAnd I think that's an amazing shift,\n\n54\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.200\nto have the leader call themselves\nthe servant because that's\n\n55\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.830\nreally what they're doing is\nhelping you do your job better.\n\n56\n00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.930\nYeah I think that the best companies\nthat I've seen the best the most high\n\n57\n00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.710\nproductive organisations that I've seen\nwhen I meet with other business leaders.\n\n58\n00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.860\nAnd we interview them and\ntalk with them I think the biggest\n\n59\n00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.650\ndifference that I see is that they hire\npeople who are good at what they do,\n\n60\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.270\nwho are really,\nreally passionate about what they do.\n\n61\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.750\nAnd then these leaders kind of tell\nthem what the expectations are.\n\n62\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.120\nSo say, here I expect you to produce x,\ny, and z.\n\n63\n00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.730\nAnd then these best leaders\nget out of their way,\n\n64\n00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.140\nlike literally say go do your thing\nbecause you should know what you're doing,\n\n65\n00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.398\nand you're the rock star,\nand that's why I hired you.\n\n66\n00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:34.760\nAnd they led them in a way that says,\nthis is what the end product is,\n\n67\n00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.190\nthis is what success looks like,\nnow go ahead and do it.\n\n68\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.900\nThe managers, what do the managers do?\n\n69\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.570\nThe managers go in and start saying,\nhey what are you gonna do today?\n\n70\n00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.610\nTell me what you're gonna do\nbecause I think you should do this.\n\n71\n00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.668\nWhat are you gonna do this week?\n\n72\n00:03:49.668 --> 00:03:52.708\nNo, what I want you to do is,\nI want you to do this right.\n\n73\n00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:56.931\nYou start telling them and literally\nin essence micromanaging your team,\n\n74\n00:03:56.931 --> 00:04:00.830\nstep by step and really trying to\nget control of what they're doing.\n\n75\n00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.462\nAnd their productivity typically tends\nstarts going down, this is a concept\n\n76\n00:04:05.462 --> 00:04:11.220\nthat's really, I can't imagine how many\nyears this has been going on, right.\n\n77\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.540\nThis managing concept, it's kinda\nlike a punitive type of management.\n\n78\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.460\n&gt;&gt; Well I think that happens in\na lot of cases where a manager\n\n79\n00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.250\nis worried about their own job security.\n\n80\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.260\nAnd maybe hires people that don't want\nto be stars because they don't wanna\n\n81\n00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.630\nlose their own position.\n\n82\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.820\nI think the great managers,\n\n83\n00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.660\nthe really great ones, are the ones\nthat are confident enough to go out and\n\n84\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.800\nhire people that they know\nare smarter than them.\n\n85\n00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.510\nPeople that might be\nbetter at that specific\n\n86\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.890\njob that they're asking them to do.\n\n87\n00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.770\nYou might be a great leader, but\nthe person that I need to do this role,\n\n88\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.790\nthey're gonna be the expert at that and\nthat's great.\n\n89\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.360\nAnd it's not hard for me to find\npeople that are smarter than me.\n\n90\n00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.610\nBut I think a lot of employees, or\na lot of companies need to go and\n\n91\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.110\ntake that approach and say,\nI trust you to do your job.\n\n92\n00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.350\nAnd I'm gonna give you\nthe right direction to do it.\n\n93\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so, and I'll be honest,\nas a leader, as an entrepreneur,\n\n94\n00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.390\nit's very difficult to let\ngo of the reins, right.\n\n95\n00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.140\nTo really get out of the weeds, and\nkinda let go of or relinquish control.\n\n96\n00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.710\nThat's a very difficult thing to do,\nI struggled with it for many, many years.\n\n97\n00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.931\nAs entrepreneurs, I think as type A\npersonalities it's natural to think that,\n\n98\n00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:17.270\nwell nobody's ever gonna\ndo it as good as me.\n\n99\n00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.930\nNobody's ever gonna be as efficient as me,\n\n100\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.530\nnobody's ever gonna be able\nto sell as good as me.\n\n101\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.780\nNobody's ever gonna be able to do x,\ny, or z as good as me.\n\n102\n00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.570\nAnd you know, the truth is while, and\n\n103\n00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.610\none of my mentors told me this many,\nmany years ago.\n\n104\n00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.220\nThe truth is the key is finding\npeople who cannot be as good as you.\n\n105\n00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.980\nBecause you're probably never gonna find\nsomebody as good as you in your standards.\n\n106\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.548\nThe key is to find somebody who can do\nthe work at least 70% as good as you.\n\n107\n00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:49.750\nAnd free up 100% of your time,\nthat's the key.\n\n108\n00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.000\nIf you can get to that,\nthat is considered success and\n\n109\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.440\nonce you get to that then\nyou'll be able to say, okay,\n\n110\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.100\nthis person can do it 70% as good as me,\nthe result gets done.\n\n111\n00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.905\nIt's 70% as good and\nmy time is 100% freed,\n\n112\n00:06:01.905 --> 00:06:04.069\nthen you let go completely of control.\n\n113\n00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:05.301\nWhen you do that,\n\n114\n00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:10.488\nwhen you do that you will allow your\nteam to spread their wings and take off.\n\n115\n00:06:10.488 --> 00:06:14.709\nAnd I found that nine out of ten times,\nwhen that happens, this person will\n\n116\n00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:19.360\noutperform anything that you ever did,\nand actually be better than you.\n\n117\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.180\nThe problem is that we tend to\nlike micromanage and control, and\n\n118\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.920\nwe teach them to do things\nexactly as we do it.\n\n119\n00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.700\nAnd it's not their style or\nit's not their forte to do it your way.\n\n120\n00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.890\nThey can do it their way,\nthey're probably experts at it but\n\n121\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.670\nsince you're holding down their wings,\nthey can never get past that 70%.\n\n122\n00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.390\nIt's only when we step back and\ntruly allow them to spread their\n\n123\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.290\nwings that they can actually go out and\nbe better than you at what they did.\n\n124\n00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.917\nAnd that seems only hard for\nthem in the first place.\n\n125\n00:06:46.917 --> 00:06:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou used a sports example earlier.\n\n126\n00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.780\nI think this lends itself\nreally well as well,\n\n127\n00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.731\nif you're on a basketball team you\ncan't play all the positions at once.\n\n128\n00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:57.490\nAnd if you just hog the ball and\nsay I'm the best, I'm the one that knows\n\n129\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.230\nhow to do this everyone gets to guard\nyou and you're not gonna do well.\n\n130\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.688\nYou look at Micheal Jordan, one of\nthe greatest basketball players of all\n\n131\n00:07:04.688 --> 00:07:07.697\ntime and he's able to do what he\ndoes because he passes the ball,\n\n132\n00:07:07.697 --> 00:07:11.187\nhe shares with his team, he gets them\nopened, and in turn he gets opened.\n\n133\n00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:14.735\nAnd it works better when you surround\nyourself people that, I mean,\n\n134\n00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:17.551\nthose weren't amazing\nplayers that were around him,\n\n135\n00:07:17.551 --> 00:07:21.610\nbut they were able to do amazing things\nbecause they worked together as a team.\n\n136\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.438\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, and again, going\nback, right, we gotta really get past\n\n137\n00:07:26.438 --> 00:07:29.961\nthis, as a society,\nget past this concept of managing.\n\n138\n00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:34.270\nI think this is a dated concept, I think\nthis is a concept that really should be\n\n139\n00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.003\nphased out of the workplace and\nwe really need to focus on leading.\n\n140\n00:07:38.003 --> 00:07:39.660\nHow do we lead our team?\n\n141\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.980\nHow do we improve ourselves as leaders?\n\n142\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.410\nHow do we encourage our\nteam to be leaders, right?\n\n143\n00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.500\nWe need to teach them to be leaders\nbecause not necessarily are they\n\n144\n00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.250\nborn leaders.\n\n145\n00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.440\nMaybe they never taught leadership skills,\nso\n\n146\n00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.230\nwe need to bring that into the forefront\nand teach our entire team to be leaders.\n\n147\n00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.040\nLike I mentioned before, everybody in my\ncompany, you do not get promoted until\n\n148\n00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.720\nyou teach somebody everything you know and\nthey can do your job.\n\n149\n00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.770\nIt's the only way you get promoted,\nthat's what a leader does.\n\n150\n00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.910\nA leader leads by examples,\n\n151\n00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.160\nlet me show you, let me build you,\nlet me encourage you.\n\n152\n00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.609\nThose are the kinda things that\nreally make for great organizations,\n\n153\n00:08:12.609 --> 00:08:16.717\ngreat environments, great cultures and\ngreat collaboration amongst your team.\n\n154\n00:08:16.717 --> 00:08:19.741\nIt's important that we\nstart leading our team,\n\n155\n00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:22.700\nbe the leader that your\nteam wants to look up to.\n\n156\n00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.433\nYour team wants to follow somebody, right?\n\n157\n00:08:24.433 --> 00:08:27.002\nThey wanna follow your vision,\nthey wanna follow your dream,\n\n158\n00:08:27.002 --> 00:08:28.810\nthey wanna follow your purpose.\n\n159\n00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.667\nBut if we sit there and micromanage and\ntell them what to do and\n\n160\n00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:34.413\nconstantly be putting that\nkind of management pressure,\n\n161\n00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:37.228\nyou're never gonna allow your\nteam to spread their wings.\n\n162\n00:08:37.228 --> 00:08:39.610\nYou're never gonna allow\nthem to be leaders and\n\n163\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.160\nyou're never gonna be able to be a leader\nyourself, so it's kinda counter-intuitive.\n\n164\n00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.570\nWe want the freedom, but at the same time,\nwe don't give any freedom.\n\n165\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.806\n&gt;&gt; And that leader needs to remember\nthey're part of the team and\n\n166\n00:08:48.806 --> 00:08:49.803\nthey need to work that way.\n\n167\n00:08:49.803 --> 00:08:54.124\nIt's not an adversarial attitude, like you\nmight've seen 50 years ago in a factory\n\n168\n00:08:54.124 --> 00:08:57.969\nwith a supervisor and the people out in\nthe line, you need to work together and\n\n169\n00:08:57.969 --> 00:09:00.710\nthey're really an important\npart of the team.\n\n170\n00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.294\nSo, any final thoughts?\n\n171\n00:09:01.294 --> 00:09:03.210\nI know we're getting close on time here.\n\n172\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:08.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just to close off,\nwith Millennials, leadership is key.\n\n173\n00:09:08.325 --> 00:09:11.465\nI think that's the style of management,\nif you wanna call it per se,\n\n174\n00:09:11.465 --> 00:09:12.925\nthat they're really looking for.\n\n175\n00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:16.875\nAgain, they're looking up to the\nentrepreneurs that are really exceeding\n\n176\n00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:18.525\nand doing amazing things in the world.\n\n177\n00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:21.705\nEvery single one of those entrepreneurs\nare great leaders, and I think that's what\n\n178\n00:09:21.705 --> 00:09:25.285\nwe need to be focusing on is really again\nlooking back in the mirror and focusing on\n\n179\n00:09:25.285 --> 00:09:29.720\nour self and saying, am I being that\nleader that I want my team to follow?\n\n180\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.480\nOr am I being a manager?\n\n181\n00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.430\nWhat am I being right now?\n\n182\n00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.060\nBecause this is the new\nstyle of the world today.\n\n183\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.220\nAnd I think that that's what we need to\npush forward, not only will Millennial's\n\n184\n00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.420\nreally love this concept and they'll\nappreciate you more, and follow you more.\n\n185\n00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.540\nBut I think every single generation\nwill also appreciate that as well.\n\n186\n00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.542\nAnd we need to start incorporating\nthat in all of our work places.\n\n187\n00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:49.430\n&gt;&gt; Those are great words to live by,\nI think a fantastic point for\n\n188\n00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.630\nus to go ahead, and\nwrap up for this episode.\n\n189\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.450\nSo signing off,\nI'm your host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n190\n00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.935\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Javier Montes, your\nMillennial expert, thanks for tuning in.\n\n191\n00:09:56.935 --> 00:09:57.609\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n192\n00:09:57.609 --> 00:10:07.387\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Yeah, it's a great experience,\nthey love that.\n\n78\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.940\nThey love being a part of building\nsomething that's bigger than themselves,\n\n79\n00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.890\nso the first one is\ndefinitely in that concept.\n\n80\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.410\nThe second thing we wanna talk about,\nis setting\n\n81\n00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.500\ngoals that are beyond something\nthat's reasonable, right?\n\n82\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.561\nCrazy, unreasonable goals\nreally motivate millennials.\n\n83\n00:03:56.561 --> 00:04:00.181\nWe talked about millennials\nbeing extremely optimistic, so\n\n84\n00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:05.124\nwhile the goals may seem unrealistic or\nunreachable millennials are optimistic and\n\n85\n00:04:05.124 --> 00:04:07.800\nwant to really go out and get these goals.\n\n86\n00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.960\nSo setting these hight goals is something\nthat's really motivating to millennials,\n\n87\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.410\nand millennials really wanna spend\ntime working their buts off so they.\n\n88\n00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.190\nThey can try to get these goals,\nand really achieve them, and\n\n89\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.360\nreally make a difference in the world.\n\n90\n00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.520\nI think that's really key for\n\n91\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.450\na second type of characteristic\nin the entrepreneurial world.\n\n92\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.240\n&gt;&gt; Now, is there a negative effect,\nthough, if a goal is so lofty and\n\n93\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.160\nyou don't reach it?\n\n94\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.990\nI mean,\nwe've talked before about millennials\n\n95\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.130\nnot used to losing [LAUGH] with the way\nthey were necessarily brought up.\n\n96\n00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.970\nSo, can that be a problem, or\nis that not what you're seeing?\n\n97\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n98\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.640\nI mean, here's my take on this, right?\n\n99\n00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.480\nAnd there's a different school of thought\nthat says you set something too high, and\n\n100\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.690\nthen you end up being demotivated\nwhen you don't get it.\n\n101\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.490\nIn my experience, and everybody can run\ntheir company in their own way, and\n\n102\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.720\nthey can choose to choose\ntheir goals however they like.\n\n103\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.930\nIn my experience, right, most of the time,\n\n104\n00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.780\nevery time I've been let down by a goal,\nit's not because I set it too high,\n\n105\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.370\nit's typically because I set\nit too low and reached it.\n\n106\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.800\nRight, I always look back and\nsay man I hit that goal, but I felt\n\n107\n00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.940\nlike I could have done so much more, and\nthat is where I get let down the most.\n\n108\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.890\nSo let's say your goal is I don't know\nlet's call it ten right that's the goal,\n\n109\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.870\nso you said alright well what if I\nhit what if we made the goal 30?\n\n110\n00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.840\nAll right, so I'm suggesting, instead of\nhaving your goal be 10, let's shoot for\n\n111\n00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.060\n30 make your new goal 30.\n\n112\n00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.065\nThat's crazy, right?\n\n113\n00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:35.720\n10 is realistic, 30 is my God, that's wow.\n\n114\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.125\nHere's what happens, right?\n\n115\n00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:39.345\nYour team starts to rally and\nstarts to do things, and\n\n116\n00:05:39.345 --> 00:05:42.575\nyou start to think about what it's\ngoing to take to get to 30, right?\n\n117\n00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:43.815\nCuz ten is no longer the goal.\n\n118\n00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:45.745\nNow it's like, okay, well,\nwe know we gotta get past ten,\n\n119\n00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.705\nI don't know how we're gonna get to ten,\nbut the goal is not ten.\n\n120\n00:05:48.705 --> 00:05:51.895\nThe goal is 30, so\nyou start to take actions based on 30.\n\n121\n00:05:51.895 --> 00:05:59.020\nAnd what happens is you may not make 30,\nbut you may make 22, right.\n\n122\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.240\n22 is far beyond 10.\n\n123\n00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.140\n&gt;&gt;
