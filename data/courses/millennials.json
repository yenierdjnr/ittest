I'm doing fantastic, Peter.\n\n9\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.060\nVery excited to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.310\nVery excited to talk about,\nsome of the content in my book.\n\n11\n00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140\nSo today we're gonna talk a lot about\nunderstanding the millennial mindset and\n\n12\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.800\ntrying to understand, what is it that\nshaped millennial in the workforce today?\n\n13\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.510\nLike, their certain like experiences that\nthey went through as they were growing up,\n\n14\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.180\nas they were going through their younger\nyears, their adolescent year that really\n\n15\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.270\nshaped the way that this generation really\nthinks and acts and makes decisions.\n\n16\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.280\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, so for this episode,\nwhere are we starting?\n\n17\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.310\n&gt;&gt; So\nlet's start on participation was enough.\n\n18\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.750\nSo this is a topic\nthat's very relevant and\n\n19\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.320\nI know some of us have heard about this\nand this concept, and some of us have\n\n20\n00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.280\ntalked a little bit about it with some\nof our peers but let's jump right into\n\n21\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.410\nwhy this was important and why millennials\nthink that participation is enough.\n\n22\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.260\nSo as adolescents and as teenagers and\nas kids millenials were growing up in\n\n23\n00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.790\na time where their parents were watching\nthe media and the parents were watching\n\n24\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.410\nthe news and everywhere they looked there\nwas this concept coming up all over\n\n25\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.100\nthe place of protecting\na child's self-esteem.\n\n26\n00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.170\nAnd a child's self-esteem was the most\nimportant thing to these parents.\n\n27\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.290\nBecause the media kept telling and\npushing down our throats,\n\n28\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.900\nthat a child's self-esteem,\nif it was hurt at a young age,\n\n29\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.600\nthen it led to higher chances of suicide\nwhen the children became adults.\n\n30\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.590\nAnd this concept really drove home\nthrough millennials' parents.\n\n31\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.180\nSo parents became a little freaked\nout about this and they're like well,\n\n32\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.130\nI don't want that to happen to my child, I\nmean no parent wants to think about that.\n\n33\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.340\nWhen the media was pushing this\ndown the parent's throats,\n\n34\n00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.260\nwhat would happen is self esteem\nbecame a very important concept and\n\n35\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.560\nprotecting a child's self\nesteem was very important.\n\n36\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.326\nSo going forward what would happen is the\nparents of the millennials would go right\n\n37\n00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:04.882\ninto the millennials' personal lives, so\n\n38\n00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:08.335\nin school, in their offside\nactivities like sport teams,\n\n39\n00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:13.447\nif they joined any particular like extra\ncurricular activity, if they're in ballet,\n\n40\n00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:17.935\nif they did any of those activities\nparents were very much watching over their\n\n41\n00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:22.700\nkids to make sure their self-esteem was\nnot being tarnished, to making sure that\n\n42\n00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.518\nthey were protecting that nobody really\nimposed on this child's self-esteem.\n\n43\n00:02:27.518 --> 00:02:31.128\nNow what happened was that that put\na lot of pressure on the teachers,\n\n44\n00:02:31.128 --> 00:02:34.500\nthat put a lot of pressure on\ncoaches of teams, on instructors.\n\n45\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.365\nAnd so much pressure came from\nthe parents to the coaches that this\n\n46\n00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:44.229\nled to the coaches having to\nrecognize all the children equally so\n\n47\n00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:50.066\nthat one child didn't feel left out or\none child didn't feel less important,\n\n48\n00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:54.850\nless valuable, or\nless talented than the other children.\n\n49\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know I played popcorn or\nfootball growing up and I remember you had\n\n50\n00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.470\nthe rule where each player had to get\nin for a certain number of plays.\n\n51\n00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.200\nAnd it kind of felt odd almost those\nplayers that only got in for two or\n\n52\n00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.790\nthree plays.\n\n53\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.090\nYou said well they're only putting them\nin because they have to not because they\n\n54\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.930\nearned that spot.\n\n55\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.560\nKinda causes some conflict on the team.\n\n56\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.390\nSo that kinda has some adverse\nconsequences for the kids.\n\n57\n00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n58\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.860\nin theory this concept with the parents,\nit sounded like it made sense.\n\n59\n00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.990\nAnd it said, well,\nwe wanna protect our children and\n\n60\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.990\nwe wanna make sure that\nthey're treated fairly.\n\n61\n00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.870\nBut the downside of that, which we\ndidn't really see it at the time, but\n\n62\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.890\nwe're starting to see it today as these\nmillennials now come into the workforce,\n\n63\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.900\nas now they're put into real life.\n\n64\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.730\nWhat happened was that these\nparents deprived their children\n\n65\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.870\nof a very important life lesson.\n\n66\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.140\nThese parents took away this opportunity\nfor children to learn that in life,\n\n67\n00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.820\nif you want to win,\nyou need to outwork the loser.\n\n68\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.660\nYou need to put in more effort\nif you want to be the best.\n\n69\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.500\nIf you wanna be recognized, you need\nto work harder than your counterparts.\n\n70\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.776\nAnd unfortunately the millennials\nnever learned that lesson.\n\n71\n00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:06.900\nMillennials were taught, well if I show\nup, I'm gonna get an opportunity to play\n\n72\n00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.870\nlike you just mentioned and at the end of\nthe season everybody's gonna get a trophy.\n\n73\n00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.050\nCoaches were put in a very difficult\nposition where coaches had to see\n\n74\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.640\nhow can I recognize each child?\n\n75\n00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.570\nWhat am I gonna recognize this child for?\n\n76\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.530\nAnd that's were you got most improved\nplayer, we got best effort, right?\n\n77\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.410\nIt wasn't just the MVP that got a trophy.\n\n78\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.170\nIt wasn't just the person\nwho outperformed.\n\n79\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.850\nAnd the first thing that happened was\nwe taught these millennials that,\n\n80\n00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.400\nyou just show up and you're gonna get\nrecognized just like everybody else.\n\n81\n00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.280\nThe second thing that happened,\n\n82\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.120\nwas that we were teaching\nthe hard working students.\n\n83\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.550\nWe were teaching the actual students and\nkids that were outperforming.\n\n84\n00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.790\nWe were teaching them that that\nwasn't necessarily very valuable,\n\n85\n00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.110\nbecause even though you worked hard and\nyou put in more effort, guess what?\n\n86\n00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.220\nEverybody else will also get\nrecognized just like you.\n\n87\n00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.870\nMaybe you might get a bigger trophy, but\n\n88\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.460\nmost of the time,\neverybody have the same size trophy.\n\n89\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.900\nOne would still say MVP.\n\n90\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.330\nBut the guy that got most improved,\nit was the same exact trophy.\n\n91\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.450\nBecause the parents were putting so\nmuch pressure on these coaches, right?\n\n92\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.460\nAnd you could just imagine\nthe coach's position and\n\n93\n00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.645\nthe teacher's position, right?\n\n94\n00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:19.395\nThey were put in a very ugly and\nnasty place we're they could\n\n95\n00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:23.885\nnot recognize a stellar performer because\nthe pressure came from the parents.\n\n96\n00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:26.555\nDon't hurt my child's self\nesteem even though he hasn't\n\n97\n00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:28.585\nput in the extra effort to be the best.\n\n98\n00:05:28.585 --> 00:05:33.300\n&gt;&gt; Sure so, what impact does that have\non those kids that grew up and now today\n\n99\n00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.280\nare in the workforce, are they coming\nto work with those same expectations?\n\n100\n00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.660\nIs that something that as an employer or\n\n101\n00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.715\nas a co-worker you want to help try to\nbreak that or work with them on that.\n\n102\n00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:48.085\nWhere do we do from there?\n\n103\n00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:51.575\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what's happening is,\nas employers, first thing we need to\n\n104\n00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:56.285\nunderstand is that when we start\nlabeling millennials as entitled.\n\n105\n00:05:56.285 --> 00:05:57.762\nRight, this word Word\nis tossed around a lot.\n\n106\n00:05:57.762 --> 00:06:00.062\nA millennial shows up to work and\nall of a sudden they're entitled.\n\n107\n00:06:00.062 --> 00:06:03.422\nThey think they're deserving of\npromotions, of higher salaries, or\n\n108\n00:06:03.422 --> 00:06:06.892\nthey're deserving of corner offices.\n\n109\n00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:10.782\nAnd we have to understand, to a certain\nextent, this is no fault of their own.\n\n110\n00:06:10.782 --> 00:06:12.932\nThis is just the hand they were dealt.\n\n111\n00:06:12.932 --> 00:06:14.612\nThis is the world they were brought up in.\n\n112\n00:06:14.612 --> 00:06:18.630\nThis is the world that their\nparents actually were the ones that\n\n113\n00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.020\nraised them in this manner.\n\n114\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.920\nBecause that's what was\ngoing on at the time.\n\n115\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.310\nSo, as employers, the first thing we\nneed to do is start to recognize and\n\n116\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.790\nbe a little more patient.\n\n117\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.880\nWe've got to understand and\nexplain to them and\n\n118\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.260\ncreate the culture in our\norganizations that they can fit into.\n\n119\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.960\nThat will actually help them understand\nthat if you want to be recognized,\n\n120\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.770\nyou need to outwork your counterparts,\nright?\n\n121\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.870\nSo what do we do as employers\nto really create that culture?\n\n122\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.370\nNumber one that I always recommend to\nall of the entrepreneurs I talk to and\n\n123\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.800\nall the managers and CEOs of companies,\n\n124\n00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.470\nis create a very clear\nscoreboard in your company.\n\n125\n00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.380\nSo teach your team very\nclearly what it is to win.\n\n126\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.830\nRight, define winning.\n\n127\n00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.610\nDon't just say, okay well great, we had\na great year this year and sales were up.\n\n128\n00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.150\nBut that's not really relevant,\nwe need to be very specific.\n\n129\n00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.830\nAnd we want to get a scoreboard for\nevery single position in the company,\n\n130\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.100\nevery single department, and find a way to\nmeasure what the production looks like.\n\n131\n00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.190\nFind a way to measure\nwhat winning looks like.\n\n132\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.230\nSometimes it could be\ncustomer service scores.\n\n133\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.390\nSometimes it could be number\nof leaves that came in.\n\n134\n00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.550\nSometimes it could be maybe\nour marketing department is\n\n135\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.460\nmeasuring the social media traffic.\n\n136\n00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.930\nMaybe it could be number of episodes\nrecorded, I mean there could be\n\n137\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.300\na number of things that really\naffect what that person is doing and\n\n138\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.040\nif you have a very clear scoreboard,\nwhen a millennial comes on board,\n\n139\n00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.080\nthe millennial will learn and say okay, I\nwant to be at the top of that scoreboard.\n\n140\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.620\nAnd when my name is constantly\nshowing up at the bottom or\n\n141\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.570\nat the middle of the scoreboard,\nI understand and\n\n142\n00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.430\nI know what activities I need to\nengage in to therefore become better.\n\n143\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.890\n&gt;&gt; And that sounds like maybe giving\nsome clear expectations of not just hey,\n\n144\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.420\nwe want you here on the top, but\nwhen you are on the bottom here\n\n145\n00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.440\nare some things you can do\nto work your way back up so\n\n146\n00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.780\nwe know what's expected of you and\nhelp them achieve those goals.\n\n147\n00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n148\n00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:07.040\nI mean that couldn't be exactly\nbetter said because most of the time,\n\n149\n00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.200\nthe organizations that I work with,\nthe companies that I talk to,\n\n150\n00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.380\nthe entrepreneurs,\n\n151\n00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.180\nwe have a definition in our mind of\nwhat success looks like for our company.\n\n152\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.380\nWe know,\nwe have a very clear vision in our head\n\n153\n00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.120\nof what we want\nthe organization to accomplish.\n\n154\n00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.140\nWhere most entrepreneurs, managers and\norganizational leaders fail\n\n155\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:30.540\nis clearly articulating that vision and\nthat definition of success to our team.\n\n156\n00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.210\nIf we don't pull that information out of\nour head and give it out to our team,\n\n157\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.760\neither through a painted picture of where\nwe're trying to go, scoreboards, KPIs,\n\n158\n00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.200\ndashboards, these kind of tools need to\nbe put into your organization to clearly\n\n159\n00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.130\narticulate to your team what success\nlooks like, what does winning look like?\n\n160\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:48.920\nAnd typically,\n\n161\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.610\nif a company's doing it, they typically\ndo it on a very global scale.\n\n162\n00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.480\nIt's very few companies, and this is only\nthe highest performing companies that I've\n\n163\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.570\nseen that do this well are the ones\nthat break it down to a granular level,\n\n164\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.280\ndown to each different department and\neach different role, right?\n\n165\n00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.720\nAnd that's where we need\nto get really clear.\n\n166\n00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.110\nSo create a dashboard for\nevery single role in your company, so\n\n167\n00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.410\nthat every role knows exactly what\nthe definition of success in that role is.\n\n168\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.420\nAnd as a millennial coming\ninto that type of culture,\n\n169\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.990\ninto that type of organization, they will\nquickly assimilate because they understand\n\n170\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.020\nthis is how I am being measured,\nthis is how I'm being rewarded, and\n\n171\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.630\nthis is what success looks like.\n\n172\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.240\nso when I walk into a company as\na millennial, there's no obscure sense of\n\n173\n00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.510\nwho's winning, who's losing, who's\nputting in the effort, who's out working.\n\n174\n00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.890\nAnd I know that participation\nin this workplace is not enough.\n\n175\n00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.410\nSo if I just showed up to work, that\ndoesn't mean I'm guaranteed my paycheck.\n\n176\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.570\nI need to earn my place to be here and\nif I'm not putting in the work,\n\n177\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.920\nI'm not putting in the effort, one of\nmy counterparts can outperform me, and\n\n178\n00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.460\nI can either possibly lose my job or\nI'm not gonna be entitled to the bonuses,\n\n179\n00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.790\nrewards, or higher commissions.\n\n180\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.560\n&gt;&gt; And that's a great point you just\nbrought up that maybe participation is\n\n181\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.370\nenough to keep your job but if your\ncompensation is tied to that if it's\n\n182\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.080\na sales position and you're on commission\nor there are those bonus programs.\n\n183\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.530\nThat's maybe how we kind of\nget that message across that\n\n184\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.890\nparticipation might have been\nenough when you were a kid but\n\n185\n00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.680\nit's not enough here in\nthe workforce today.\n\n186\n00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.560\nBut are there any other topics you'd\nlike to cover in this episode?\n\n187\n00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.090\n&gt;&gt; No, that's pretty much the main gist.\n\n188\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.120\nI just really want to be clear and\nexplain to the entrepreneurs and\n\n189\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.080\nthe leaders and the organizational leaders\nthat just labeling the millennials and\n\n190\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.330\ntelling them, you're entitled.\n\n191\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.580\nAnd I'm not gonna hire a millennial,\nor just letting them go.\n\n192\n00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.630\nWe need to turn around and\nreally start to look in the mirror.\n\n193\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.830\nAnd say,\nwell what are we doing as an organization?\n\n194\n00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.180\nWhat are we doing as a team to really\nalign everybody in our organization,\n\n195\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.490\nand teach our millennials, and everybody\nin the workforce, because right now we're\n\n196\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.830\ntalking specifically about millennials,\nbut there's not one single generational\n\n197\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.160\nperson on your team that will not\nappreciate this kind of clarity.\n\n198\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.740\nThere's not one single person in your\ncompany right now that will not get value\n\n199\n00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.200\nand prove their performance if we can\nbe extremely clear about measurements.\n\n200\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.470\nSo let's not be so\nquick to label them as entitled.\n\n201\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.280\nBut let's take a look in the mirror and\nreally think.\n\n202\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.470\nWhat are we doing and\nhow are we adding to this in our culture?\n\n203\n00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.270\nAre we creating a culture\nby default that things just\n\n204\n00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.150\nhappen because I expect everybody\nto know what success looks like?\n\n205\n00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.750\nOr are we creating a purposeful\nculture that creates and\n\n206\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.630\nempowers our team to be leaders and\nbe winners.\n\n207\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, great Javier,\nthat's a lot of fantastic information.\n\n208\n00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.760\nIt'll help us out, and\nit'll get a lot more information on\n\n209\n00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.680\nworking with millennials and\nunderstanding the nuances of that.\n\n210\n00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.280\nWe're gonna have to save that for\nfuture episodes.\n\n211\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.170\nSo going ahead and signing off,\nI've been your host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n212\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.958\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Javier Montes,\nthe millennial expert.\n\n213\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:38.642\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see\n\n214\n00:11:38.642 --> 00:11:43.720\nyou next time.\n\n215\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.185\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
