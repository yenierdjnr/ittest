[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:07.922\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:11.010\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.486\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:17.660\nyou're watching emergent technology\nsecurity demonstrations.\n\n8\n00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.300\nWe're specifically gonna be diving\ninto the realm of taking look at\n\n9\n00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.200\nexposures that we can get\nfrom unmanaged devices.\n\n10\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.950\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and here to\nhelp us out is gonna be Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.300\nDon, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.236\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:32.309\nAnd yeah,\nin this episode like Ronnie said,\n\n14\n00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.419\nwe're gonna take a look at what it\nmeans to us, as administrators,\n\n15\n00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:38.880\nif we have to deal with a network that\nallows for unmanaged mobile devices.\n\n16\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.279\nAnd, let's start right there with what\nthe heck is an unmanaged mobile device and\n\n17\n00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:44.110\nwe'll kinda get into the risk afterwards.\n\n18\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.695\nWe have this new movement going on\nright now that's called the BYOD or\n\n19\n00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:50.920\nbring your own device movement.\n\n20\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.504\nIn the past, like when I think about it,\nwhen I got out of college,\n\n21\n00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:57.128\ngot my first IT job and\nwent to work for a company,\n\n22\n00:00:57.128 --> 00:01:00.510\nthey issued me a company laptop and\nI had a company desktop.\n\n23\n00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.731\nAnd so, when I was at work I\nused the company desktop and\n\n24\n00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.050\nwhen I was at home I\nused the company laptop.\n\n25\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.290\nAnd then, after a little while I\nwas issued a company cellphone.\n\n26\n00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.400\nAnd, if I may work phone calls\nI use my work cellphone.\n\n27\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.050\nAnd, if I made personal calls,\nI use my personal cellphone if I\n\n28\n00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.070\nhad even one back then I\ndon't think I even have one.\n\n29\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.980\nSo, that's how it was back in the day.\n\n30\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.530\nWell the nice part about that is,\n\n31\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.860\nbecause these were work devices, they were\ncompletely controlled by the company.\n\n32\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.130\nThe company had total control and\n\n33\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.610\nthey could dictate what applications were\nallowed to run, what permissions I had.\n\n34\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.650\nEvery aspect of that device, and\n\n35\n00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.959\nthat device's security was\ndictated by the company.\n\n36\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.080\nBut, over time, right,\nwe had a lot of people wear it like me,\n\n37\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.260\nI used a BlackBerry for ten years,\nI used a BlackBerry and\n\n38\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.360\njust thought it was the greatest thing.\n\n39\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.450\nAnd then the iPhone came out and\nthe iPhone did so\n\n40\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.150\nmuch more than the BlackBerry did.\n\n41\n00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.169\nAnd then, the Android phones came out and\nthey did so\n\n42\n00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:59.404\nmuch more and\nI wanted to switch to one of those, right?\n\n43\n00:01:59.404 --> 00:02:00.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so, I went and bought my own.\n\n44\n00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.730\nI did the first generation iPhone and\nthen the first generation Android phone.\n\n45\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.350\nAnd now, I had these phones that\nI like better than my work phone.\n\n46\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.850\nAnd when I got to the office,\nI didn't wanna use the work phone.\n\n47\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.030\nI wanna use my phone.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.210\n&gt;&gt; Or, maybe I had a laptop\n\n49\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.220\nthat was better than the one they issued\nme for work and I wanted to use my own.\n\n50\n00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.850\nBut I couldn't because at the office,\nthey required us to use the work device,\n\n51\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.670\nright, that ensured security.\n\n52\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.170\nBut that started to change.\n\n53\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.200\nIn the last five to ten years, companies\nhave started saying, wait a minute.\n\n54\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.700\nIf these people wanna buy their own\nphones and they're willing to pay for\n\n55\n00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.460\nit, we could save money.\n\n56\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.700\nWe could let them bring their\nown device and use it for work.\n\n57\n00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.630\nThis is genius.\n\n58\n00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.195\nNow we don't,\nwe don't have to do warranties,\n\n59\n00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:45.810\nwe don't have to do any of that stuff.\n\n60\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.050\nThey pay for it and they're willing\nto do it, and they're happy to do it,\n\n61\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.202\n'cause they get the device they\nwant.That's a, that's a win win, right?\n\n62\n00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:54.400\nCompany says, people get the device\nthey want, that's perfect.\n\n63\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.880\nBut it comes with a risk.\n\n64\n00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.360\nAnd the risk is,\nwhen somebody brings their own device,\n\n65\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.440\nthe company doesn't control it,\nthey can't control what apps are on it.\n\n66\n00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.196\nThey can't control whether it's secure or\nnot, whether it's being updated.\n\n67\n00:03:08.196 --> 00:03:10.070\nThey can't control any of that.\n\n68\n00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.720\nAnd now, you might have people who yeah\nthey're bringing their own device,\n\n69\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.240\nyou save a little money.\n\n70\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.150\nBut, they compromise your network, right?\n\n71\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.000\nWe can really run some big risks by\nallowing these unmanaged devices.\n\n72\n00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.080\nAnd so, when that happens,\nwhat are some of our biggest risks?\n\n73\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.950\nWell, the biggest risk is leaking\nyour corporate data, right.\n\n74\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.892\nAnd nowhere do we see\nthis more than email.\n\n75\n00:03:31.892 --> 00:03:36.331\nAll you have to do is turn on the news to\nfind out that celebrity acts or politician\n\n76\n00:03:36.331 --> 00:03:40.990\nwise had their email compromised and\nsome of these read through all of it.\n\n77\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.785\nThat, if I'm checking my company\nemail on my personal phone, and\n\n78\n00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:49.810\nmy personal phone gets stolen or\ngets lost, and\n\n79\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.560\nit wasn't secured, somebody who finds that\nphone, now has access to all of my email.\n\n80\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.380\nAnd what can the company do about it?\n\n81\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.702\nNothing at that point,\nthe device is already gone, right?\n\n82\n00:03:59.702 --> 00:04:01.930\nThey lost their opportunity to control it.\n\n83\n00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.080\nThat should have been a managed device,\none that the company controlled, but\n\n84\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.140\nit wasn't.\n\n85\n00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.770\nAnd in super critical high secure\nenvironments, it will be a device, right?\n\n86\n00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.890\nThink about the president right,\nwhen President Obama was elected,\n\n87\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.310\nor President Trump,\n\n88\n00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.430\nthe news made a big deal out of both\nof them with their cell phones.\n\n89\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.670\nThey had their personal cell\nphones they really liked.\n\n90\n00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.900\nAnd the government had to switch\nthem to one of the black phones.\n\n91\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.580\nThe secure phones, because just a regular\nconsumer grade phone is not gonna do for\n\n92\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.255\nthe President of the US so,\nthey had to switch to a secure phone.\n\n93\n00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:36.770\nThat is a reality, right, for\na high security environments.\n\n94\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.580\nBut if you're a medium size company,\nor even a large business,\n\n95\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.320\nyou can save a lot of money by having\npeople bring their own devices,\n\n96\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.580\nyou just have to be smart about it.\n\n97\n00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.330\nYou have to secure them, protect them, and\n\n98\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.850\nensure those devices\nare configured in a secure manner.\n\n99\n00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.070\nAnd the best way to do\nthat is to manage them.\n\n100\n00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.750\nNow in the next episode, we're gonna take\na look at actually using what's call\n\n101\n00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.280\nmobile device management,\nallowing us to manage those devices.\n\n102\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.030\nBut before we get in to that, let's talk\na little bit about the security features\n\n103\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.740\nin the phones themselves that are supposed\nto be helping us secure things.\n\n104\n00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.880\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Don, help us out here.\n\n105\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.344\nNow that we've got these types\nof our own unmanaged devices,\n\n106\n00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:14.807\nwhat are some of the attacks that\nwe're really looking out for\n\n107\n00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:17.486\nwhen we're doing this\ninside of our networks?\n\n108\n00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:20.928\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I mentioned not really\nan attack, but a risk a minute ago.\n\n109\n00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:22.560\nI said,\nwhat if somebody loses their phone?\n\n110\n00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.680\nI could find the phone and exploit it or\nget the data out of that phone.\n\n111\n00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.130\nWell, that's not really\na purposeful attack.\n\n112\n00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.330\nThat's a chance occurrence.\n\n113\n00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.390\nI just happened to find a phone, great.\n\n114\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.500\nBut if somebody wants to target your\ncompany and they know that you're using\n\n115\n00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.570\nunmanaged devices, devices that have\nbeen brought in by end users and\n\n116\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.250\nthey're managing themselves then, there's\na ton of attacks that are available.\n\n117\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.220\nThey can target them through a number of\nthings like Rouge App Stores and push\n\n118\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.440\nTrojan Horses and malware and things like\nthat onto a phone to start tracking and\n\n119\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.500\nleaking data out of that device.\n\n120\n00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.730\nA remote exploit is probably\none of the biggest risks.\n\n121\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.224\nWe'll see in another\ndemonstration coming up.\n\n122\n00:06:00.224 --> 00:06:04.624\nWe've got jailbreaking end users\nwill sometimes intentionally\n\n123\n00:06:04.624 --> 00:06:09.090\nmake their phones less secure,\nright, take an iOS device.\n\n124\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.080\nWhen you buy an iPhone or an iPad, an iOS\ndevice, it can only run applications\n\n125\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.600\npulled from the Apple App Store,\nfrom the iTunes App Store, or whatever.\n\n126\n00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.430\nOr, applications that have been digitally\nsigned by a trusted company, so\n\n127\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.310\na company can push their own applications\nwithout going through the app store.\n\n128\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.071\nBut everything else has come to the app\nstore unless the user jailbreaks\n\n129\n00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:31.830\ntheir phone.\n\n130\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.940\nIf they jailbreak it,\nnow they can install apps from anywhere.\n\n131\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.360\nAnd maybe they wanna run things\nlike video game emulators.\n\n132\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.360\nYou can't run those on an iPhone normally.\n\n133\n00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.220\nBut you can pull them from these\nalternative app stores if you jailbreak.\n\n134\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.980\nAnd the risk there is, when you jailbreak,\nyou're weakening the security of the phone\n\n135\n00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.860\nand that can be taken advantage of very,\nvery easily.\n\n136\n00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.630\nThat's something we just can't\nallow in a corporate environment,\n\n137\n00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.910\nweaken security too much.\n\n138\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.420\nSurveillance, if an attacker gets\nphysical access to a phone, even for\n\n139\n00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.270\na moment ,there's a number of different\nexploits they can apply to the phone,\n\n140\n00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.370\nto set it up for\nremote surveillance, right?\n\n141\n00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.142\nAnd I'll show it in an episode later\non here, where we take a phone and\n\n142\n00:07:11.142 --> 00:07:15.686\nwe remotely exploit it,\nwe inject a malware into it via webpage.\n\n143\n00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:18.878\nAnd once that's done, we can open up\na session, and do things like turn on\n\n144\n00:07:18.878 --> 00:07:22.520\nthe microphone, and listen to what's\ngoing on on that phone, in that area.\n\n145\n00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.140\nWe can record what's on the camera,\nwe can send text messages from that phone.\n\n146\n00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.075\nYou can do all sorts of things, remotely.\n\n147\n00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:31.715\nAnd from a surveillance perspective,\nit's perfect\n\n148\n00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:35.455\nbecause you've got a GPS on the phone,\nso you can track where people are going.\n\n149\n00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:36.775\nYou've got a microphone,\nyou've got a camera.\n\n150\n00:07:36.775 --> 00:07:39.645\nSo now, you've got eyes and\nears on the person.\n\n151\n00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:44.085\nYou know exactly where they are,\nall because that phone got exploited.\n\n152\n00:07:44.085 --> 00:07:45.177\nWe definitely don't want that.\n\n153\n00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:48.896\nYou might have security personnel that\nmonitor your physical building, and\n\n154\n00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:52.670\nif they're bringing their own device and\nthose device is being compromised,\n\n155\n00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.272\nnow someone could determine where\nthe security guards or in a given time and\n\n156\n00:07:56.272 --> 00:07:58.929\nuse that as part of a physical\nbreak in unto a facility.\n\n157\n00:07:58.929 --> 00:08:01.046\nThose are things that\naren't just possible,\n\n158\n00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:03.551\nthese are things that have\nalready happened, right?\n\n159\n00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:05.730\nThere are documented cases\nof these events occurring.\n\n160\n00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.308\nSo definitely something\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n161\n00:08:08.308 --> 00:08:10.682\nAnd then lastly, data tampering.\n\n162\n00:08:10.682 --> 00:08:13.306\nThat if somebody has access\nto your information,\n\n163\n00:08:13.306 --> 00:08:16.685\nif they can get into the phone's data,\nthey can tamper with it.\n\n164\n00:08:16.685 --> 00:08:20.695\nA Trojan horse is an example\nwhere we modify an application to\n\n165\n00:08:20.695 --> 00:08:25.495\nthen phone home back to us and\nsend information, leak data, whatever,\n\n166\n00:08:25.495 --> 00:08:30.560\nthat we can tamper with the applications\non a phone or just our regular data.\n\n167\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.650\nI might be having email records or other\nfiles and folders stored on my phone.\n\n168\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.800\nWe can start to modify those records.\n\n169\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.320\nThese are all risks that we have when\na phone is not properly secured and\n\n170\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.243\neven a heavily secured phone\ncan be risked to some of this,\n\n171\n00:08:42.243 --> 00:08:43.867\nif it's not secured properly.\n\n172\n00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:45.643\nWe have to keep it patched and updated and\n\n173\n00:08:45.643 --> 00:08:48.946\nall the things that we know we're\nsupposed to do but a lot of people don't.\n\n174\n00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:49.566\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don,\n\n175\n00:08:49.566 --> 00:08:53.690\nyou make it sound fairly dangerous to\nactually have an unmanaged device.\n\n176\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.500\nBut don't the devices themselves have\nsome form of security that we can use?\n\n177\n00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.450\n&gt;&gt; They do, right?\n\n178\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.180\nSo phones actually do a lot\nto secure themselves.\n\n179\n00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.157\nBut in a unmanaged device, right, so if I\ngo to the store and I buy my own phone,\n\n180\n00:09:05.157 --> 00:09:06.019\nI now manage it.\n\n181\n00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:08.250\nNot my company, I do.\n\n182\n00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.720\nAnd as the end user, I can start to\nturn off those protections, right?\n\n183\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.566\nThink about a lock screen.\n\n184\n00:09:14.566 --> 00:09:19.978\nIf I wanna unlock my phone, most phones\nhave a method of doing this, right?\n\n185\n00:09:19.978 --> 00:09:22.276\nAnd it could be as simple as\nnot having a lock screen.\n\n186\n00:09:22.276 --> 00:09:25.292\nYou push the power button and\nyou're phone is on and now you're in and\n\n187\n00:09:25.292 --> 00:09:26.184\noff you go, right?\n\n188\n00:09:26.184 --> 00:09:28.912\nOr maybe it's a number pad, right?\n\n189\n00:09:28.912 --> 00:09:33.653\nSo you turn the phone on and you've gotta\npunch in a code to be able to get in or\n\n190\n00:09:33.653 --> 00:09:35.840\ndraw a pattern, to get in.\n\n191\n00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.450\nOr maybe it's a finger print scanner,\na little more advanced, right?\n\n192\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.680\nThat's what I use on my phone.\n\n193\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.550\nSo if I turn my phone on I've gotta\nuse my finger print to unlock it.\n\n194\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.950\nThat really helps secure it.\n\n195\n00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.650\nIf I lose my phone, I leave it in a cab\nsomewhere, somebody else could find it but\n\n196\n00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.830\nunless they have my code,\nthey're not gonna get at my data?\n\n197\n00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.980\nSo that's safe but if it's my phone,\nI can turn that off.\n\n198\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.190\nI can turn the finger print scanner off.\n\n199\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.070\nI can turn the number code lock off,\npattern lock, whatever it is.\n\n200\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.190\nAnd in fact,\nthey're usually off by default.\n\n201\n00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.130\nSo phones take steps,\nthey take precautions but\n\n202\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.330\na lot of times users don't\ntake advantage of them.\n\n203\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.520\nAnd that's where managing\nthe devices comes in.\n\n204\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.820\nBecause a company can come\nin with a manage policy and\n\n205\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.600\nthey can say look, your phone has to\nhave a lock screen, it's required.\n\n206\n00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.680\nAnd it has to use either a finger print or\n\n207\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.270\na six digit PIN, not a four digit,\na six digit, right?\n\n208\n00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.525\nYou can dictate policies like that and\nyour phone has to be encrypted.\n\n209\n00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:34.200\nAnd you know that almost every phone sold\ntoday supports encrypting the file system.\n\n210\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.060\nBut most of them don't\ndo it out of the box.\n\n211\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.550\nAnd the reason they don't is for\nperformance.\n\n212\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.410\nThey want the phone to run fast so\nwhen the user buys it at the store,\n\n213\n00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:46.030\nthey see this snappy new fancy phone\nthat runs nice and fast but if they turn\n\n214\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.170\non encryption, it's more secured which\nruns a little bit slower, right?\n\n215\n00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.920\nWell for a regular end user,\n\n216\n00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.820\nthey might not care about encryption, they\nmight not care, they want it to go fast.\n\n217\n00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.380\nVersus a company which'll say, hey,\n\n218\n00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.280\nwe'll gladly sacrifice\na little speed to encrypt it.\n\n219\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.222\nNow that's rapidly changing.\n\n220\n00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:02.510\nThe newest iPhones are all\nencrypted by default.\n\n221\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.140\nSo that's a new kind of thing\nthat's come out in the last year.\n\n222\n00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.030\nWe're starting to see Android\nphones that are doing the same.\n\n223\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:12.530\nBut it's a rare Android phone that\nencrypts the SD card by default.\n\n224\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.690\nIn fact many of them don't even support\nencrypting the SD card which is a shame.\n\n225\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.600\nSo there are areas where things\ncan still be weakened and\n\n226\n00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.440\nmaybe weaken their basic configuration,\nright?\n\n227\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.620\nBut there's other things that phones\ndo to try and help protect us, right?\n\n228\n00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.800\nAnd the main example I want to give of\nthat is sandboxing, that when you buy\n\n229\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.102\nan Android phone, or an iOS phone,\nthey both implement a sandboxing system.\n\n230\n00:11:35.102 --> 00:11:39.020\nAnd sandboxes are ways of\nisolating applications,\n\n231\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.570\ncreating fences in between applications.\n\n232\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.320\nSo if I run one program, and\nmaybe it's my email program,\n\n233\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.060\nit's got all my email in it.\n\n234\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.620\nAnd then I run another malicious program,\nmaybe least somehow I managed to get\n\n235\n00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.000\na malware program installed,\nthat by default, iOS and\n\n236\n00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.450\nAndroid will not allow the malware\nprogram to access my email.\n\n237\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.760\nAnd it won't be able to come over and gain\naccess to that data, they're isolated,\n\n238\n00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.510\nthey're in their own\nseparate little worlds.\n\n239\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.530\nBut it's not a perfect system because\n\n240\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.600\nwe need applications to be able\nto talk to each other, right?\n\n241\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.540\nFor example,\nmaybe Ronnie emails me a PDF, okay?\n\n242\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.260\nSo, I fire up my email program and\nI see, Ronnie sent me an email and\n\n243\n00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.870\nhere's this attachment, it's a PDF.\n\n244\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.290\nI need to open in my PDF reader.\n\n245\n00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:28.990\nWell, now I need my email client to be\nable to talk to my PDF reader, don't I?\n\n246\n00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.680\nI need those applications to talk so\nthat I can open that up.\n\n247\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.800\nAnd the vendors have found kind of some\ncreative ways to do that securely.\n\n248\n00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.800\nAnd one of the best examples is\nhow Apple handled it with iOS.\n\n249\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.660\nThey do a great job of\nsecurely controlling access\n\n250\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.180\nin between the applications.\n\n251\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:49.660\nSo every program runs in its own little\nisolated area and then there's very,\n\n252\n00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.370\nvery limited access, technically there's\nno access alowed between the applications.\n\n253\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.880\nLet me show you, it's probably easier for\nme to show it than to just talk about it.\n\n254\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.840\nI'm gonna connect into an iOS\ndevice here real quick.\n\n255\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.800\nAnd what I'm doing is instead of using the\nfancy graphical user interface that most\n\n256\n00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.310\npeople are used to,\nI'm going in to the actual shell so\n\n257\n00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.170\nthe actual back end of\nthe operating system on this phone.\n\n258\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.990\nAnd I want to show you guys\nhow applications are stored.\n\n259\n00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.616\nNow, in order to gain this type of access,\nI had to jailbreak the phone.\n\n260\n00:13:22.616 --> 00:13:25.734\nNormally, you don't have access\nto the backend file system.\n\n261\n00:13:25.734 --> 00:13:29.415\nYou can't gain root access,\nlike you see I'm logged in here as root.\n\n262\n00:13:29.415 --> 00:13:31.234\nNormally you wouldn't have that ability.\n\n263\n00:13:31.234 --> 00:13:34.142\nSo, I had to jailbreak the phone to do it.\n\n264\n00:13:34.142 --> 00:13:36.420\nBut it's my device, so\nI did it, I just jailbreak.\n\n265\n00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.210\nIt's easy, right?\n\n266\n00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.310\nBut in a corporate environment,\nthis is bad.\n\n267\n00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.440\nBecause the access that I now have is the\naccess an attacker would have if they got\n\n268\n00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.720\na hold of this device.\n\n269\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.510\nOr if I configure it incorrectly,\n\n270\n00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.610\nthey might even be able to get\nthis access over the network.\n\n271\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.990\nI am doing SSH over the network here and\nthere's no reason somebody else couldn't\n\n272\n00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.820\ndo it either and so\nnow they might have access.\n\n273\n00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.060\nThere could be other people logging into\nthis iPad right now without me knowing it.\n\n274\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.641\nHopefully not.\n\n275\n00:13:59.641 --> 00:14:01.451\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n276\n00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:04.167\n&gt;&gt; All right, so here I am in this iPad\n\n277\n00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:10.472\nand I'm in a folder, /var/root, which\nis just the folder for the root user.\n\n278\n00:14:10.472 --> 00:14:12.730\nIt's kinda like the root\nuser's home directory.\n\n279\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.160\nWell applications on an iPad and iPads and\niPhones run the same operating system.\n\n280\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.232\nThey run the iOS,\nthe Apple iPhone operating system.\n\n281\n00:14:21.232 --> 00:14:24.000\nEven though it's an iPad, it runs the iOS.\n\n282\n00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.780\nSo, they run the same iOS and on the iOS,\n\n283\n00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.780\nyou have a root user\nwhich is the super user.\n\n284\n00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.190\nAnd technically you should never have\naccess to it like what I have right here.\n\n285\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.510\nAll the applications actually\nrun as another user.\n\n286\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.187\nThey run as a user called mobile and\nso every program is running as\n\n287\n00:14:40.187 --> 00:14:43.740\na non-super user, so\na user that doesn't have root access.\n\n288\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.304\nSo that's security protection number one.\n\n289\n00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:51.540\nAnd then number two, they each have\ntheir own isolated little environments.\n\n290\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.920\nIf I browse around on this file system,\nI can see a couple of different things.\n\n291\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.252\nSo I'm in /var/ root.\n\n292\n00:14:57.252 --> 00:15:01.700\nIf I go into /var/mobile,\nthat's the folder for\n\n293\n00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.673\nthe mobile user and\nits Home folder and its Information.\n\n294\n00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:09.787\nAnd so if I take a look in there,\nI'll see Containers,\n\n295\n00:15:09.787 --> 00:15:12.853\nDownloads, Media,\nDocuments, Library, right?\n\n296\n00:15:12.853 --> 00:15:17.200\nThese are all files and things that\npertain to that user, the mobile user.\n\n297\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.928\nSo when you pickup an iPhone, a brand new\niPhone and you sign in with your Apple ID\n\n298\n00:15:20.928 --> 00:15:24.282\nand all that, you're actually logging\nin as this user called mobile.\n\n299\n00:15:24.282 --> 00:15:27.037\nEven though you have your own Apple ID,\neverybody's using the same user.\n\n300\n00:15:27.037 --> 00:15:30.438\nBut it's not like where it has the same\npassword across all the devices,\n\n301\n00:15:30.438 --> 00:15:34.390\nevery device kind of leverages\nits own credentials like that.\n\n302\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.957\nNow this mobile user exists\ninside of the sandbox.\n\n303\n00:15:38.957 --> 00:15:43.130\nAnd the sandbox has three kind of\ncontainers that are inside of it.\n\n304\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.816\nAll right, one container is\nthe application container.\n\n305\n00:15:45.816 --> 00:15:48.545\nThat's where the applications\nactually reside and\n\n306\n00:15:48.545 --> 00:15:51.407\nthe apps are stored in\na different folder altogether.\n\n307\n00:15:51.407 --> 00:15:53.456\nI'll show you that one\nhere in just a moment.\n\n308\n00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:58.073\nThen we have the data container and\nwhat I'm looking at right here is actually\n\n309\n00:15:58.073 --> 00:16:03.440\nthe data container where I see documents,\nand library, containers, downloads.\n\n310\n00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.625\nThis is the data container.\n\n311\n00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:07.649\nAnd inside of the data container,\nthere will be individual containers for\n\n312\n00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:09.530\neach application we'll\nsee in just a moment.\n\n313\n00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.100\nAnd then lastly there's\nthe iCloud container.\n\n314\n00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.510\nNow I can't show you the iCloud container\ncuz that's a completely protected system\n\n315\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.640\nthat's synchronized with Apple's iCloud.\n\n316\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.570\nBut iCloud has its own storage,\nand it's completely protected so\n\n317\n00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.370\nthat you can't modify it without passing\nthrough the iCloud APIs to do it.\n\n318\n00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.130\nSo I don't see it represented\nhere in the file system.\n\n319\n00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.990\nAll right.\n\n320\n00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:35.120\nBut, what I am seeing is user data\nthat pertains to this particular user.\n\n321\n00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.250\nNow, when I install an application,\nit's really important\n\n322\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.140\nthat applications don't get modified,\nthat they don't get tampered with.\n\n323\n00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.290\nSo Apple does two things.\n\n324\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.780\nFirst, they put it in protected storage.\n\n325\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:51.690\nThe applications are actually\nstored in /var/containers/,\n\n326\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.140\nall right, so the applications are stored\nin the separate folder outside of\n\n327\n00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.270\nthe mobile user.\n\n328\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.300\nSo the mobile user does not have\nwrite permission to this folder.\n\n329\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.340\nThey can't change the files.\n\n330\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.630\nWhen you install an application, it's the\nIOS on the back end that's installing it,\n\n331\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.754\nand then the mobile user just has\nread access to that application.\n\n332\n00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:11.520\nSo they can't tamper with\nan application once it's in there.\n\n333\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.570\nAnd even if they could,\nthe applications are digitally signed.\n\n334\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.870\nAnd so, when we come in here, and\nI'm gonna switch into the Bundle folder.\n\n335\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:24.850\nSo now I'm in /var/container/Bundle,\nand I take a look inside of here.\n\n336\n00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.050\nActually, I think there\nwas one more folder.\n\n337\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.800\nYep, I need to get into Application.\n\n338\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.560\nThere we go.\n\n339\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.420\nSo /var/container/Bundle/Application,\nand when I look in here,\n\n340\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.820\nI'm going to see really long folder names,\nright?\n\n341\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.140\nAnd what these are are GUIDs, right?\n\n342\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.220\nGlobal Unique Identifiers.\n\n343\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.220\nEach application gets its own GUID.\n\n344\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.800\nAnd they need that because they're\nall going to be digitally signed.\n\n345\n00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.459\nThey have a digital signature\napplied to each application.\n\n346\n00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:54.061\nAnd where it gets really interesting is if\nRonnie installs an app on his phone and\n\n347\n00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:57.071\nI install the app on my phone,\nthey'll have different GUIDs, and\n\n348\n00:17:57.071 --> 00:17:58.955\nthey'll have different signatures, so\n\n349\n00:17:58.955 --> 00:18:02.810\nwe can't kinda piggy back off of each\nother as we tamper with these things.\n\n350\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.380\nSo, if I tamper with one of my devices,\nthe digital signature fails, or\n\n351\n00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.610\nif I tamper with the application\nitself the signature fails.\n\n352\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.180\nAnd we'll know it's a compromised\napplication, right, so\n\n353\n00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.150\nit won't be allowed to run.\n\n354\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.599\nBut if I take a look at these folders,\n\n355\n00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:19.463\nI'm just gonna use the date\nhere to figure out.\n\n356\n00:18:19.463 --> 00:18:20.820\nI installed Pokemon Go.\n\n357\n00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.097\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be my test app for\n\n358\n00:18:22.097 --> 00:18:22.750\nthis show here.\n\n359\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.390\nIt's fairly popular right now.\n\n360\n00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.710\nSo, I installed it on April 2nd.\n\n361\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.890\nI'm gonna switch into that folder.\n\n362\n00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:35.490\nAnd inside of that folder, we're going to\nsee, there it is, pokemongo.app, right?\n\n363\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.960\nAnd when I look at that file,\npokemongo.app, it's 1.5 kilobytes in size,\n\n364\n00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.310\nwell, that's because this is a directory,\nright?\n\n365\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.150\nThe bundled application is\nactually stored in a directory.\n\n366\n00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.435\nAnd then if I go inside of it,\nI'll see the data inside.\n\n367\n00:18:49.435 --> 00:18:54.220\nBut pokemongo.app,\nthat's the actual application right here.\n\n368\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:19:00.370\nAnd if I get into its folder,\nwhich I can do like this, there we go.\n\n369\n00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.320\nNow I'm actually seeing\nthe graphics assets for\n\n370\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.780\nthat file and the true application,\nwhich is down there at the bottom.\n\n371\n00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.280\nSee Pokemon Go, 54 megabytes?\n\n372\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.000\nThat's the actual application.\n\n373\n00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.820\nAnd the user and group that owns it,\nthe install daemon, right.\n\n374\n00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.130\nSo _installD.\n\n375\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:17.930\nThat's the install daemon.\n\n376\n00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.870\nIt's a service that runs\nin the background, and\n\n377\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:24.070\nit's what actually did the installation,\nand it's what controls access to it.\n\n378\n00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:29.650\nBut if you look at the Unix permissions\non the side, you've got RWX, RXRX.\n\n379\n00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.790\nThat means the owner,\ninstallD has read, write and execute.\n\n380\n00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.610\nThe group which is installD has read,\nwrite, and execute.\n\n381\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.900\nAnd everyone else has read and execute.\n\n382\n00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.840\nSo regular users can\nlaunch the application,\n\n383\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.730\nbut they can't modify it right,\nso that's important.\n\n384\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.150\nAnd even if they could modify it,\nit would damage the signature.\n\n385\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:52.370\nSo this is the application container, the\napplication is isolated right over here.\n\n386\n00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:58.430\nIf I switch back to /var/mobile and\n\n387\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:03.700\nget back here, this is the user, and\nif I get into the containers folder\n\n388\n00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.580\nright in here,\nI'm gonna see data and shared, okay.\n\n389\n00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.750\nThere's two different folders here for\ndata for applications.\n\n390\n00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.930\nThe data folder is isolated for\neach individual application,\n\n391\n00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:22.034\nshared is the data that is allowed to\nbe exchanged between applications.\n\n392\n00:20:22.034 --> 00:20:25.930\nAnd on most iOS devices you'll find\nwhere shared is completely empty.\n\n393\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.673\nThat there is very,\n\n394\n00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:29.220\nvery little data that's allowed\nto be shared between application.\n\n395\n00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.020\nSo for the most part,\nyou're gonna not see much in there.\n\n396\n00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.895\nIt's usually like game center junk\nthat we don't care about anyway.\n\n397\n00:20:34.895 --> 00:20:42.030\nBut if we go into data, into here, now we\ncan start to get into our data containers.\n\n398\n00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.730\nAnd there's an application folder in here,\njust like before.\n\n399\n00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.120\nI always forget that application folder.\n\n400\n00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.950\nAnd let me get into it.\n\n401\n00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:54.070\nAnd what we're going to see in\nhere is another giant list of\n\n402\n00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.260\nGUIDs basically that are coming up for\nall these applications.\n\n403\n00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.800\nLet me just try and\nclean that up a little bit more.\n\n404\n00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.900\nThere we go.\nAnd so\n\n405\n00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.370\nI'll see a ton of applications that\nare all being listed right here.\n\n406\n00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.780\nAnd as I look in my list,\nI'll see April 2nd, this guy, and\n\n407\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.570\nthat's gonna be the Pokemon GO, again,\nthat I installed just the other day.\n\n408\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.670\nSo I'm gonna copy that GUID so\nI can get at it.\n\n409\n00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.838\nAnd then we'll change into that directory.\n\n410\n00:21:19.784 --> 00:21:21.810\nAnd take a look at what's in there, right?\n\n411\n00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.060\nAnd as I look in there I'll see there\nis a document folder, a library folder,\n\n412\n00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.170\na store kit folder.\n\n413\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.200\nThe most important one for\nme is gonna be this documents folder.\n\n414\n00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.774\nAnd inside of the documents folder,\n\n415\n00:21:30.774 --> 00:21:36.940\nif I can spell it right, [LAUGH]\nInside this documents I see nothing.\n\n416\n00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.670\nI see nothing cuz I've\nnever actually run the app.\n\n417\n00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.010\nI installed but I didn't run it.\n\n418\n00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.570\nSo it hasn't generated any documents.\n\n419\n00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:47.320\nBut what you're gonna find in here is that\nthe application will store its files,\n\n420\n00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.140\nits information,\nits preferences will be stored in here.\n\n421\n00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.220\nAnd they'll be isolated\nfrom other applications.\n\n422\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.230\nLet me just pick another\napplication here and\n\n423\n00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:02.110\nlet's see if we can find somebody a little\nmore interesting than old Pokemon Go.\n\n424\n00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.270\nBut they'll store their\ninformation in here.\n\n425\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.270\nAnother one I haven't run.\n\n426\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.680\nThis is the, the biggest challenge we have\nis that there are so many applications in\n\n427\n00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.510\nthe list and they have all got this\nkind of GUID names attached to them.\n\n428\n00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.470\nSo it's hard to tell what is what.\n\n429\n00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.000\nBut basically, they are gonna store their\ninformation right there in that documents\n\n430\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.030\nfolder, and that's gonna\nisolate them from anybody else.\n\n431\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.810\nSo if I have an email client and\n\n432\n00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:29.740\nI download a attachment, that attachment\nis gonna go in that Documents folder.\n\n433\n00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:34.820\nAnd once it's in the Documents folder,\nwell it's just gonna sit there and\n\n434\n00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.710\nthe email client will be able to see it,\nbut that's it.\n\n435\n00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.480\nNobody else will be able to see it.\n\n436\n00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.680\nIt's just gonna sit there and\nit's isolated.\n\n437\n00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.240\nSo what you'll see is Apple came\nup with an innovative way to allow\n\n438\n00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.715\nus to share applications between devices.\n\n439\n00:22:49.715 --> 00:22:54.440\nWhat they said was that instead of\nallowing one application to talk to\n\n440\n00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.410\nanother application, we're gonna gate\neverything through a share window.\n\n441\n00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.940\nAnd the share window works on\na really interesting principle.\n\n442\n00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.630\nIt says that the application is not\nallowed to talk to another application,\n\n443\n00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.610\nbut it can talk to iOS.\n\n444\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.330\nAnd when it talks to iOS, it can say I\nwanna share this with another program.\n\n445\n00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.858\nAnd iOS can make a decision,\ndo I wanna allow this or not.\n\n446\n00:23:14.858 --> 00:23:19.290\nThat gives Apple the chance to gauge\nwhether this is okay behavior or not.\n\n447\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.940\nAnd if it's okay behavior,\nit will say,okay give\n\n448\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.720\nme the file snd I'll take the file and\nI'll drop it off where it needs to go.\n\n449\n00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.571\nSo for example, if we were sharing\nsomething and it needed to be sent to\n\n450\n00:23:30.571 --> 00:23:34.881\na screen reader or something like that,\nwhat you would find is in the documents\n\n451\n00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:39.256\nfolder, so if were to get back into the\ndocuments folder of some application and\n\n452\n00:23:39.256 --> 00:23:42.480\ntake around, there's another empty one.\n\n453\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.810\nWhat you'd find in here is\nas sub folder called inbox.\n\n454\n00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.380\nAnd that inbox folder is where\nIOS would take the attachment and\n\n455\n00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.070\ndrop it off into the inbox.\n\n456\n00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.250\nAnd now that other application would\nsee this new incoming file and\n\n457\n00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.226\nbe able to act on it.\n\n458\n00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:57.549\nNow notice what happens there,\n\n459\n00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:59.860\nthe two applications never\ntalk to each other, right?\n\n460\n00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.780\nThey don't talk to each other at all.\n\n461\n00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:06.890\nThey talk to iOS and iOS takes that file\nand drops off in the other application.\n\n462\n00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.540\nSo you've always got this\nGatekeeper in between and\n\n463\n00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.470\nthat what preserves the Sandbox.\n\n464\n00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:17.330\nIf one application is fully compromised,\nit's no big deal cuz it can't talk to\n\n465\n00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.590\nany other application, it's isolated,\nprotected, and separated.\n\n466\n00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.550\nAnd when you jailbreak a phone,\nyou break that.\n\n467\n00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.330\nYou tear down those walls.\n\n468\n00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.840\nNotice how I'm just moving\nin-between these folders from\n\n469\n00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.750\napplication to application.\n\n470\n00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.500\nI can touch all of these folders.\n\n471\n00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.470\nAnd that's because this\ndevice is jailbroken.\n\n472\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.500\nThat means the walls,\nthe walled garden that they call it.\n\n473\n00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.230\nThose walls are gone on mine.\n\n474\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.190\nAnd that makes it where I can\ndo a heck of a lot more on\n\n475\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.000\nthis iPad than a normal iPad.\n\n476\n00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.410\nBut it means that my iPad is far\nless secure than a normal iPad.\n\n477\n00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:50.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, I know you really\nwant to get into showing us Android,\n\n478\n00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.300\nbut let's go back to the share\ndialogue thing a little bit, and\n\n479\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.000\ncan you show us a little bit about it.\n\n480\n00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.750\n&gt;&gt; I didn't think about that, Ronnie.\n\n481\n00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.240\nYou're not an iPhone user, so\nyou don't get exposed to this like I do.\n\n482\n00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.390\nI try and use as many devices as I can,\n\n483\n00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.810\nbut iPhone is a lot different from\nAndroid in the way that it shares things.\n\n484\n00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.160\nYou have what's called the share dialogue,\nin the share dialogue, it really is\n\n485\n00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.690\nthe gatekeeper in between applications,\nso it truly represents the sandboxing.\n\n486\n00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:15.580\nLet me show you an example.\n\n487\n00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.580\nI've got my iPad mirrored\nto my computer right here.\n\n488\n00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.760\nAnd let's say that for\nexample browsing the web, right?\n\n489\n00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.020\nSo I'm gonna fire up Safari and\nwhen I browse to a website like,\n\n490\n00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.880\nwe're gonna slash that, so when I browse\nto a website it's gonna pull up, right,\n\n491\n00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.810\nhere in the web browser and\nI start to see that content, right?\n\n492\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.090\nAnd everything's fine.\n\n493\n00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:41.560\nAnd then I say something like, boy, I want\nto print this web page, or I want to save\n\n494\n00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.600\nit as a PDF, or save it to Dropbox, or do\nsomething with the content of this page.\n\n495\n00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.090\nMaybe I want to take this web page and\nadd it to Microsoft OneNote or\n\n496\n00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.890\nWunderlist or something like that.\n\n497\n00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:53.840\nI want the application to talk.\n\n498\n00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.840\nThe only way I can do that\nis through the Gatekeeper.\n\n499\n00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.360\nAnd the Gatekeeper is represented in most\napplications with this little square with\n\n500\n00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.790\nan up arrow, that's the share button.\n\n501\n00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.480\nAnd when I hit that share button, so\n\n502\n00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.310\nI'm just gonna punch that,\na little drop down will appear.\n\n503\n00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.230\nAnd I'll see what I'm allowed to do.\n\n504\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.520\nAnd notice what I'm saying,\nwhat I'm allowed to do.\n\n505\n00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.600\nI could do a ton of things, but Apple is\nonly allowing me to do certain things.\n\n506\n00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.370\nSo I can save it as a PDF to iBooks.\n\n507\n00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:29.250\nI can send it to Facebook or Twitter or\nI can add to my notes or my reminders.\n\n508\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:33.100\nI see approved activities right here,\nokay.\n\n509\n00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.140\nAnd there might be some\nthat aren't turned on.\n\n510\n00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.900\nSo if I hit more or I might see\nsome here that are not enabled,\n\n511\n00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.870\nit looks like all of mine are enabled,\nthe same thing with the top row.\n\n512\n00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:43.990\nSometimes you can find,\nlike maybe I have Twitter turned off, and\n\n513\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.130\nI could turn that one on.\n\n514\n00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.780\nSo, you have a little bit of control.\n\n515\n00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:53.370\nBut all the applications are in this list,\nhave been through Apple's quality control.\n\n516\n00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.940\nThey've evaluated whether or not that\ncommunication should be allowed and\n\n517\n00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.050\nwhether it's done in a secure manner, and\nif it hasn't been, they don't allow it.\n\n518\n00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.901\nSo, if I want to say\nthis is a PDF to iBooks,\n\n519\n00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:07.260\nI can't let my web browser\ntalk right to iBooks.\n\n520\n00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.260\nI have to go through this method.\n\n521\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.090\nAnd that can be a challenge,\nbecause sometimes I might download a PDF,\n\n522\n00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.330\nand I want it to be available\nin my Kindle app, and\n\n523\n00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.840\nI don't have a way to send\nthat between applications.\n\n524\n00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.090\nThey don't allow that communication.\n\n525\n00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:23.550\nBut when I choose save PDF to iBooks,\nwhat's happening is, it's creating\n\n526\n00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:28.970\nthe PDF, it's sending it to iOS and iOS is\nthen gonna create that inbox folder I was\n\n527\n00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:33.070\ntalking about in the documents folder for\niBooks, and it's dropping that PDF there.\n\n528\n00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:38.010\nAnd then immediately, iBooks pops up and\nit says, there's something in my inbox.\n\n529\n00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.700\nIt's a PDF, let's go ahead and\nbring it in like and\n\n530\n00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.230\nsend it to iCloud or we'll bring it right\nin here, and now it's in the library.\n\n531\n00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:48.930\nBut iBooks never actually\ntalked to the web browser.\n\n532\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.820\niBooks just saw it's inbox folder and\nsaw this PDF appear, and there it is.\n\n533\n00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.790\nNow I've got this stored as a PDF and\nI can go back to Safari and\n\n534\n00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.790\ncontinue browsing the web and\ngoing wherever it is that I wanna go.\n\n535\n00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.750\nApparently no, we're too exciting.\n\n536\n00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.090\nSo we can go and\nbrowse the Internet and do our thing.\n\n537\n00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.640\nThe applications are separate.\n\n538\n00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.480\nThey talk to the operating system,\nthey never talk to each other.\n\n539\n00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.510\nSo that's a key thing to remember\nwith iOS devices like these.\n\n540\n00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:18.795\nIs Apple is always in between you and\nany communication that you make.\n\n541\n00:28:18.795 --> 00:28:22.040\nIn-between every single bit,\nwhich gives them a high degree of control.\n\n542\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.399\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, I know you\nreally wanna get an Android, but\n\n543\n00:28:25.399 --> 00:28:26.970\nI think we're pretty much out of time.\n\n544\n00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.796\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna need you to come back for\n\n545\n00:28:28.796 --> 00:28:29.760\na part two Don.\n\n546\n00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.190\nTo help us out and seeing the other\npart which is the Android part as well.\n\n547\n00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.930\nRemember what you took a look at in\nthis episode as Don really did talk\n\n548\n00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.950\nabout the idea of bringing in that BYOD,\n\n549\n00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.330\nand some of the different things\nthat can happen when we do that.\n\n550\n00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.770\nSo the idea of a managed\nenvironment is pretty key for\n\n551\n00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.490\nus when we take a look here too.\n\n552\n00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:47.960\nAs well as some of the different attacks,\nand\n\n553\n00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.620\nnow Don is showing us some\nof the different security\n\n554\n00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.550\nfeatures that are built into these devices\nas well, especially on the Apple side.\n\n555\n00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.930\nBut if you want to come back and\nlearn more about the Android side and\n\n556\n00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.850\nsome of the other ones that are out there,\ncome back for our part two.\n\n557\n00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.240\nIt's a great place for\nus to go ahead and sign off then.\n\n558\n00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.440\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n559\n00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.470\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n560\n00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:14.269\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more emerging\ntechnology security

00:00:10.972\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.972 --> 00:00:12.209\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.257\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to ITProTV, you're watching\nanother segment in the emerging technology\n\n6\n00:00:16.257 --> 00:00:18.060\nsecurity demonstrations.\n\n7\n00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.790\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking a look at part two on\n\n8\n00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.060\nunmanaged Mobile devices, and\nhere to help us out is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.860\nDon, last time we took a look at some of\nthe Apple devices and also you talked\n\n10\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.200\nabout the idea of bringing unmanaged\ndevices, where are we going to now?\n\n11\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI wanna take a look at Android devices and\n\n12\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.040\nhow they handle Sandboxing\napplications and\n\n13\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.590\nsee how that's kind of different\nfrom what we have with iOS.\n\n14\n00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.750\nAnd then just kinda wrap up talking\na little bit about how we handle unmanaged\n\n15\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.630\ndevices in general for an organization.\n\n16\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.540\nSo, let's not beat around the bush and\njump right into Android.\n\n17\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.745\nNow on the Android side, you'll hear a lot\nof people say, hey Android, it's open,\n\n18\n00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:56.950\nit's Open-source,\neverybody can do whatever they want.\n\n19\n00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.115\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And to someone,\n\n20\n00:00:59.115 --> 00:01:03.465\nit's true, not all of the Android\noperating system is Open-source but\n\n21\n00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:06.747\na good bid of is, the kernel,\nthe main operating system, all that is.\n\n22\n00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:12.307\nThings like the Google Play Store and\nall the actual Google services,\n\n23\n00:01:12.307 --> 00:01:15.187\nthose are all closed source, they do not\ndistribute the source code for that, but\n\n24\n00:01:15.187 --> 00:01:18.307\nthe operating itself is distributed\nas part of the AOSP, or\n\n25\n00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:20.818\nthe Android Open Source Project.\n\n26\n00:01:20.818 --> 00:01:24.518\nAnd by being open source\nit means two things,\n\n27\n00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:26.988\nright, I mean, I guess it means a lot\nof things, but two main things.\n\n28\n00:01:26.988 --> 00:01:30.878\nOne, it means that developers have\naccess to the source code, so\n\n29\n00:01:30.878 --> 00:01:33.268\nthey can see exactly how the system works,\nand\n\n30\n00:01:33.268 --> 00:01:36.848\nthey can develop their applications to\ntake advantage of it to the fullest.\n\n31\n00:01:36.848 --> 00:01:40.764\nAnd as a result, you'll find where Android\napplications can do things that go far\n\n32\n00:01:40.764 --> 00:01:44.759\nbeyond what their counterparts on iOS\ncan do, right, that's the positive side.\n\n33\n00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.473\nThe negative side of being an Open-source\nthough was that everyone has access to\n\n34\n00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:52.131\nthe source code, so if you're an attacker,\nyou can sit there and parse through\n\n35\n00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:55.973\nthe code and look for common exploits and\nidentify them and take advantage of them.\n\n36\n00:01:55.973 --> 00:02:00.272\nNow, the same side goes for security\nresearchers, they can look at the code and\n\n37\n00:02:00.272 --> 00:02:02.969\nfind exploits and\npattern of vulnerabilities and\n\n38\n00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.199\npatch them prior to them being\ntaken advantage of, right?\n\n39\n00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:09.405\nRemember you get the two stages of\nan attack where there is finding of\n\n40\n00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:10.306\nvulnerability and\n\n41\n00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:14.036\nthen actually using the vulnerability\nwhich is what turns it into an exploit.\n\n42\n00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:17.950\nBy being an Open-source, we hope that\npeople can find the vulnerability\n\n43\n00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.740\nfirst before it becomes an exploit,\nright, so that's kind of the goal.\n\n44\n00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.669\nBut after that, after we set aside that\ndifference, you'll find where Android\n\n45\n00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.696\nhandles applications in much\nthe same that iOS does, right.\n\n46\n00:02:28.696 --> 00:02:31.746\nRemember in iOS,\nwe had these Containers, Sandboxes and\n\n47\n00:02:31.746 --> 00:02:36.230\napplications were stored in one isolated\narea that users couldn't change and then,\n\n48\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.490\nthe data for those applications\nwere stored in a different area.\n\n49\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.238\nWe'll find the same thing on Android\nphones, let me pull up the file system\n\n50\n00:02:44.238 --> 00:02:47.512\nhere, so, I'm logged into a shell\naccount on an Android phone,\n\n51\n00:02:47.512 --> 00:02:50.028\nthis Android phone sitting\nhere right beside me.\n\n52\n00:02:50.028 --> 00:02:54.655\nSo I'm connected into it and I'm kinda\ntaking a look at it's file system and I'm\n\n53\n00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:59.575\njust in the root user's home directory,\nnow unlike iOS, Android phones run Linux.\n\n54\n00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:04.695\nSo they're actually running the Linux\nKernel and so if I do like U-name I'll\n\n55\n00:03:04.695 --> 00:03:10.129\nsee this one is running Linux 3.4.0 which\nis not a recent Kernel by any means,\n\n56\n00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.500\nright, I think 4.6 or\n4.7 is the current main line Kernel.\n\n57\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.570\nBut it's running Linux, and that means\nthat it follows the Linux file system and\n\n58\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.550\na lot of other things that are Open-source\nand standard formats that we're used to,\n\n59\n00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.860\nis all kind of right here, so\nit makes it easy to navigate.\n\n60\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.301\nBut, when I start poking\naround the application,\n\n61\n00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:32.410\nyou'll see things are different than what\nwe have with a normal Linux installation.\n\n62\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.162\nSo, for example, all of the applications\nthat we install from the Android app\n\n63\n00:03:37.162 --> 00:03:39.469\nstore are installed as APKs, right?\n\n64\n00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.685\nAnd an APK is an archive file, its really\njust a zip file, if you rename it dot zip,\n\n65\n00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:49.600\nyou can open it up, but it has all\nthe application files zipped together, and\n\n66\n00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.341\nthey're stored in /data/app, right?\n\n67\n00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:56.530\nAnd when I look inside of /data/f,\nhere's the applications I've installed.\n\n68\n00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.590\nNow they don't have separate folders\nwith GUIDs like we saw under iOS, but\n\n69\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.240\neach one is stored here separately.\n\n70\n00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.486\nAnd I'll see of the applications that\nhave been installed, and we'll see,\n\n71\n00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:11.404\nthere's old Pokémon GO, sitting right\nthere in the Niantic Labs pokemongo-1.apk.\n\n72\n00:04:11.404 --> 00:04:15.116\nNow, notice how some of these have a -2\nafter them versus a -1 as they take\n\n73\n00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:19.238\nupdates, you'll find where they download\na second copy with a different number and\n\n74\n00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:23.068\nwhen it's fully downloaded and installed,\nthen it can remove the old one, so\n\n75\n00:04:23.068 --> 00:04:25.070\nthat's kinda part of the replacement.\n\n76\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.942\nSo you'll see those numbers change from\ntime to time like YouTube here has\n\n77\n00:04:28.942 --> 00:04:32.000\napparently taken some kind\nof an update at some point.\n\n78\n00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.100\nIt may also be that it was\ninstalled as a system app\n\n79\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.710\nThe apps that I'm looking at here\nare apps that I've installed.\n\n80\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.300\nThere's system apps that are part of the\noperating system that you can't uninstall,\n\n81\n00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.460\nso there might be a version of YouTube\nthat shipped with this as a system app.\n\n82\n00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.876\nAnd then it downloaded an update in\nthe update exists here, cuz I can roll\n\n83\n00:04:47.876 --> 00:04:51.770\nback the update, but I can't remove\nthe one that came with the system.\n\n84\n00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.560\nBut the bulk of the applications that\nwe install are gonna be right here\n\n85\n00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.220\nin /data/app and they're just APK files,\n\n86\n00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.910\nif I pull up the listing\na little different here.\n\n87\n00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.650\nLet me stretch this a bit wider so\nI get a little less screen wrap on it.\n\n88\n00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.360\nWe can look and find things like,\nPokemon Go and it's 88.8 megabytes and\n\n89\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.860\non the iOS it was a directory\nI could just navigate into.\n\n90\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.470\nBut here it's an archive and\n\n91\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.480\nif I look at the permissions I'll see\nwhere the system account has read\n\n92\n00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.820\nwrite access, then the system group has\nread only and users have read only.\n\n93\n00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.210\nNotice how users have read only but\n\n94\n00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.680\nnot execute, cuz it's not an executable,\nit's an archive, it's an APK.\n\n95\n00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.440\nSo when we run it, we're actually\nuncompressing it into RAM and\n\n96\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.160\nexecuting it, now, you might say to\nyourself isn't that inefficient?\n\n97\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.560\nIt's actually not, it is a little bit\nI guess when you launch it, right?\n\n98\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.180\nBut what's happening is every\ntime you run the application it's\n\n99\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.930\ndecompressing it throwing it in the RAM,\nso it gets tampered within RAM.\n\n100\n00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.150\nThe next time you close and open it,\n\n101\n00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.000\nit's put back to the way\nthat it was before, right?\n\n102\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.400\nSo it is nice and safe,\n\n103\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.880\nit should be safe anyway cuz we don't have\nright access to this particular location,\n\n104\n00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.210\nbut it's an extra protection\nmeasure that's put in there.\n\n105\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.840\nBut these are all\nthe applications in /data/app,\n\n106\n00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.415\nyou've also got /data/data and\n\n107\n00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:12.605\nin that one, I know it's a little\nredundant, but /data/data,\n\n108\n00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:16.565\nthat's where all these applications\nare storing their information.\n\n109\n00:06:16.565 --> 00:06:21.285\nSo when I installed Pokemon Go, somewhere\nin here it has a Niantic Labs folder and\n\n110\n00:06:21.285 --> 00:06:24.300\nwe can try and\nfind that buried in here, here it is.\n\n111\n00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.580\ncom.nianticlabs.pokemongo, right,\nso that's the location and\n\n112\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.290\nin Pokemon Go, any data that it stores,\nis being placed right in there.\n\n113\n00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.360\nSo if I change into that directory,\nand start looking around,\n\n114\n00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.670\nI can see what's in there, now,\nI haven't actually run the program yet, so\n\n115\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.210\nit doesn't have any data beyond A link\nto a library file that it's got.\n\n116\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.100\nSo it's got a library that it's\ncalling with some data in it, but\n\n117\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.100\nother applications that we see,\nyou may have things like bookmarks and\n\n118\n00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.220\nother things that are all\na part of that application.\n\n119\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.630\n&gt;&gt; And they'll all be stored right\nhere in their separate folder,\n\n120\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.140\nwhere they're stored separate\nfrom each other, right, so\n\n121\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.450\nwe get this isolation in between\nthe applications, all right.\n\n122\n00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.730\nAnd one application is not allowed to\nmodify another application by default,\n\n123\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.060\nbut here's where things get\na little different, okay.\n\n124\n00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.700\nIn the IOS world, it's expressly\nforbidden, you cannot have two\n\n125\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.320\napplications talk to each other, unless\nyou go through Apple's Gatekeeper, and\n\n126\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.370\nApple's Gatekeeper makes the decision\nwhether that's allowed or not.\n\n127\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.080\nOn the Android operating system though,\nlet's say that Ronnie is an app developer\n\n128\n00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.801\nand I'm an app developer, two separate\ncompanies and we decide to work together.\n\n129\n00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:35.518\nHey, Ronnie, you've got this scanner\napplication and it let's you take\n\n130\n00:07:35.518 --> 00:07:39.220\na picture of a document and\nit scans it and turns it into a document.\n\n131\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.455\nAnd then, I've got a printer application\nthat let's you print to printers on\n\n132\n00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:44.905\nthe network, let's work together,\nlet's make it work,\n\n133\n00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:48.155\nwe can take a picture in your app and then\nit hands over to my app and you print it.\n\n134\n00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:50.984\nSo now, I can take a picture of anything\nand prints out on a printer, it's great,\n\n135\n00:07:50.984 --> 00:07:53.081\nand we just reinvented\nthe photocopier from 30 years ago.\n\n136\n00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:54.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie and\n\n137\n00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:59.636\nI are working together can issue each\nother keys and those keys can allow his\n\n138\n00:07:59.636 --> 00:08:05.110\napplication to talk directly to mine, or\nmy application to talk directly to his.\n\n139\n00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.320\nSo, while that's forbidden by default,\nAndroid allows you to do that.\n\n140\n00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.930\nIf two developers choose to work together,\n\n141\n00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.120\nthey can make their\napplications talk together.\n\n142\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.550\nAnd there's many application that do that,\nthat allow multiple applications to talk\n\n143\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.710\ntogether and\nwork together to do various things.\n\n144\n00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.860\nSo that's one big difference\nthere is that Android\n\n145\n00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.890\ndoes give the developers the option\nto bypass that level of security.\n\n146\n00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.160\nBut the developers have to do it,\nand they do have to work together.\n\n147\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.500\nOne developer can't just decide, hey,\n\n148\n00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.040\nI'm gonna start accessing all\nthese other developers' things.\n\n149\n00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.360\nThat doesn't work, right.\n\n150\n00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.240\nSo the two developers have to\nwork together to do it, right.\n\n151\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.680\nNow there is one other area that\nreally makes Android different, and\n\n152\n00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.839\nit's a directory,\nlet me show you guys here.\n\n153\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.480\nIf I go to slash SD card okay?\n\n154\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.310\nThis is the big differentiator\nbetween Android devices and iOS.\n\n155\n00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.660\nWhen you buy an iOS device, when you\nbuy an iPhone like this one over here.\n\n156\n00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.230\nThis one is I think 64 gigabyte or\n120 gigabyte, I don't know.\n\n157\n00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.800\nWhen you buy it,\nit comes with a certain amount of storage.\n\n158\n00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.490\nAnd then that's it.\n\n159\n00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.460\nThat's the storage it has.\n\n160\n00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.950\nYou can't add more, you can't take away,\nyou can't upgrade it.\n\n161\n00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.430\nThat's it.\nThat's the storage it has.\n\n162\n00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.970\nBecause all the storage is internal and\nit's all completely locked down.\n\n163\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.280\nBut when you buy an Android phone,\nnot every Android phone but\n\n164\n00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.440\nmost Android phones have an SD Card slot.\n\n165\n00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.830\nYou can add more storage to them.\n\n166\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.660\nAnd you can take away.\n\n167\n00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.340\nOr you might have more than one SD\ncard and you can swap them out.\n\n168\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.820\nAn applications can save to that SD card.\n\n169\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.390\nNow, when applications save\ntheir data to the SD card,\n\n170\n00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.337\nthat data is not protected the same\nway as it is on the /data/data.\n\n171\n00:09:41.337 --> 00:09:45.290\nAnything in /data/data is locked\ndown to that application or\n\n172\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.320\nto other developers that you've approved.\n\n173\n00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.830\nBut when you write to the SD\ncard it's the wild west.\n\n174\n00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.990\nWhen I save something into\nthe download folder on my SD card,\n\n175\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.130\nevery application can access it.\n\n176\n00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:01.660\nAnd so now we've kinda broken down\nthat wall, a malicious application\n\n177\n00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.090\ncould create a specially crafted MP3 file,\nright\n\n178\n00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.990\nStagefright the Stagefright attack that\neverybody was talking about with Android.\n\n179\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.240\nIt used maliciously crafted MP4s,\nvideo files.\n\n180\n00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.020\nSo you could have a malware application\nthat creates a malicious MP4 and\n\n181\n00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.960\ndumps it right into your movies folder.\n\n182\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.910\nAnd then in some completely unrelated\nmovies app, you fire it up,\n\n183\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.210\nit goes to pull up thumbnails\nof all the videos.\n\n184\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.610\nIt hits the malicious one and\ntriggers the StageFright exploit.\n\n185\n00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.713\nAnd now you get a remote injection attack,\nyou've got a compromised device and\n\n186\n00:10:33.713 --> 00:10:35.260\neverything goes from there.\n\n187\n00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.340\nBecause the two device or\n\n188\n00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.660\nthe two applications were\nsharing the same storage.\n\n189\n00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.150\nThe two applications didn't\ntalk to each other, but\n\n190\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.010\nthey share the same storage, right?\n\n191\n00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.230\nShared storage is a big challenge for\nAndroid and\n\n192\n00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.520\nsomething we need to be aware\nof as we're securing devices.\n\n193\n00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.040\nIf you have users who are bringing in\na phone or a tablet that's running Android\n\n194\n00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.130\nfrom home, they could put in\ntheir own SD card in there.\n\n195\n00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.710\nAnd the SD card could\nalready have bad stuff on it.\n\n196\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.840\nYou don't know.\n\n197\n00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.730\nAnd so locking down that SD card or even\nforbidding the SD card might be something\n\n198\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.780\nthat we need to do to secure our devices.\n\n199\n00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.250\nAll right, so that's the big\ndifferentiator between Android and\n\n200\n00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.030\niOS is that SD card, right?\n\n201\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.420\nThat extra storage that kinda\nbreaks down our security walls.\n\n202\n00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:20.400\nAll right, so now that we've kinda seen\nhow iOS stores and does its sandboxing and\n\n203\n00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.810\nhow Android does its sandboxing.\n\n204\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.500\nThey each kinda have their pros and\ncons, right?\n\n205\n00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.440\nTwo different models but, there's other\nthings that we need to be aware of,\n\n206\n00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.920\nthat when you buy an Android phone or\nyou buy an iOS phone,\n\n207\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.350\nthey're actually pretty\nsecure right out of the box.\n\n208\n00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.510\nAnd as long as you take the basic\nphysical security measures of\n\n209\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:41.140\nassigning a pass code or some kind of\nunlock mechanism for the device, and\n\n210\n00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.760\nusing the device's encryption, as long as\nyou do that, devices are pretty secure.\n\n211\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.390\nSo if they're pretty secure,\nhow do they get compromised,\n\n212\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.790\nhow do we hear about all these\ndevices getting compromised?\n\n213\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.140\nAnd usually it's the users\ndoing it themselves, right?\n\n214\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.840\nSo there's two main ways that\npeople get exploited, right?\n\n215\n00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.830\nThe main way, the way that happens\nthe most, is where a user intentionally\n\n216\n00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.400\nweakens their security, and\nthen they get compromised right?\n\n217\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.210\nAnd the best example of that\nare third party app stores.\n\n218\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:15.510\nIn the iOS environment you\ncan only install applications\n\n219\n00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.980\nfrom the iOS app store and that's it.\n\n220\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.140\nAnd every iOS app in the app store has\nbeen tested by Apple to be clean and\n\n221\n00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.680\ncertified and deployed down right?\n\n222\n00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.970\nBut you can intentionally\nweaken your device.\n\n223\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.700\nYou can go to sites like build.io or\n\n224\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.190\nbuilds.io, I think I\nmight have that wrong.\n\n225\n00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.490\nThe Build Store.\n\n226\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.470\nWhere they will give you a certificate,\n\n227\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.460\nand if you trust that certificate,\nyou can now install apps they've made.\n\n228\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.240\nWell, who tested those apps?\n\n229\n00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.210\nNobody, right?\n\n230\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.100\nYou don't know, you're trusting some\ncertificate from a company that you\n\n231\n00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.650\ndon't even know a single\nperson that works at.\n\n232\n00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.488\nYou've intentionally\nweakened your security.\n\n233\n00:12:51.488 --> 00:12:55.320\nOr on Android, you might want to do\nsomething like screen sharing, right?\n\n234\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.630\nYou've probably seen me do it here\nwhere I take my Android phone and\n\n235\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.770\nI show the screen on my laptop.\n\n236\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:04.390\nWell you can turn on USB\ndebugging on the phone and\n\n237\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.460\nthat allows additional communications\nover the USB cable to do things\n\n238\n00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.430\nthat have a higher level of privilege\naccess than is normally allowed, and yeah,\n\n239\n00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.190\nthat lets me share my screen, but\n\n240\n00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.540\nit's also something that attackers can now\ntake advantage of if I leave it turned on.\n\n241\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.790\nI need to turn it off when\nI'm not using it, right?\n\n242\n00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.910\nSo that's stuff that end users\ndo to weaken their devices.\n\n243\n00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.070\nAnd there have been some high profile\nattacks that have kind of fit this mold\n\n244\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.980\nover the years,\n\n245\n00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.990\nwhere people are leveraging these third\nparty app stores that have malicious apps.\n\n246\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.550\nIt's usually when they're stealing apps,\nright?\n\n247\n00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:40.628\nYour average app is what $0.99 maybe 4 or\n5 bucks, but people don't wanna pay it.\n\n248\n00:13:40.628 --> 00:13:45.700\nAnd so they'll go to app\nstores like XLIs or sites\n\n249\n00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.070\nlike that where you can start downloading\nall of these paid apps for free.\n\n250\n00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:55.330\nWell, the way they made them for free is\nby modifying the app files to basically\n\n251\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.090\nbypass the security checks and the receipt\ncheck to make sure you purchased it.\n\n252\n00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.810\nWell if they bypass those checks,\nthe files can be infected,\n\n253\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:03.610\nthere's no check anymore.\n\n254\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.660\nThere's no examination to make\nsure those files are in tact.\n\n255\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.840\nAnd you willingly install them on\nthe device, and now you're compromised.\n\n256\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.320\nRight so that's the primary\nattack method for Android and\n\n257\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.240\niOS devices is that people willingly\nallow their device to get attacked.\n\n258\n00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.640\nThe second one though is where there's\nactually a vulnerability on the device,\n\n259\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.250\nthat there's a vulnerability that's\na part of the base operating system, and\n\n260\n00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.660\nan attacker takes advantage of that and\nexploits it.\n\n261\n00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.360\nNow that's not the end user's fault.\n\n262\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.600\nNot always.\n\n263\n00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.760\nUsually when an exploit is detected,\nwhoever the vendor is that manufactured\n\n264\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.090\nthe device learns about the vulnerability,\nlearns about the exploit if there is one\n\n265\n00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.800\nand then patches it and\npushes out an update.\n\n266\n00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.400\nWell what if you don't wanna update,\nright?\n\n267\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.400\nLet me use my iPad.\n\n268\n00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.962\nHere's an example.\nThe iPad beside me here is jail broken,\n\n269\n00:14:51.962 --> 00:14:55.021\nwell, you can jail break iOS 9.3.3 and\nearlier.\n\n270\n00:14:55.021 --> 00:14:57.720\nWell, 9.3.5 is out right now.\n\n271\n00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.742\nWhy don't I upgrade to 9.3.5?\n\n272\n00:15:01.742 --> 00:15:05.094\nIt'll remove the jail break and\nI need the jail break for the show.\n\n273\n00:15:05.094 --> 00:15:07.110\n[LAUGH] I won't add it.\n\n274\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.466\nThat means that whatever\nwas fixed in 9.3.4 and\n\n275\n00:15:11.466 --> 00:15:16.025\nwhatever was fixed in\n9.3.5 I'm vulnerable to.\n\n276\n00:15:16.025 --> 00:15:19.223\nEverything that was in those, so\nif somebody wants to attack my iPad,\n\n277\n00:15:19.223 --> 00:15:21.736\nif you're the viewer at home and\nwanna attack my iPad.\n\n278\n00:15:21.736 --> 00:15:25.480\nWell, first off you'd probably need to get\nin the same building as me because you\n\n279\n00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.490\nknow you need that network connectivity,\nbut after that, you just need to go\n\n280\n00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.360\nlook at the change logs for 9.3.4, 9.3.5\nand you'll be able to attack my iPad.\n\n281\n00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.240\nYou'll have exploits that\nactually do work on my device.\n\n282\n00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.010\nSo that's really what it comes down to.\n\n283\n00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.890\nOn iOS, it's simply our own fault.\n\n284\n00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.020\nWe need to patch.\n\n285\n00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.710\nWe need to update and Apple does\na great job of pushing those out.\n\n286\n00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.770\nOn Android it's a little trickier though,\nright?\n\n287\n00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.790\nAnd I've already given the example in some\nof the other footage we filmed about this\n\n288\n00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.890\nphone in particular.\n\n289\n00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.157\nI like this Android phone Because it's\none that got abandoned by the vendor and\n\n290\n00:15:58.157 --> 00:15:59.655\nthe carrier really, really fast.\n\n291\n00:15:59.655 --> 00:16:05.319\nSo this phone is still on sale today,\nyou can go and buy it, it's an Asus phone.\n\n292\n00:16:05.319 --> 00:16:09.348\nAnd when it came out,\nit had Android 4.4 on it and\n\n293\n00:16:09.348 --> 00:16:16.031\nthen about a month later they pushed\nan update for 4.4.2, and then that's it.\n\n294\n00:16:16.031 --> 00:16:17.983\nIt's been probably 14 months now, and\n\n295\n00:16:17.983 --> 00:16:21.289\nthey have not pushed a single update\nto this phone and all of that time.\n\n296\n00:16:21.289 --> 00:16:23.587\nThere have been a ton of\nupdate since then, right?\n\n297\n00:16:23.587 --> 00:16:27.604\nI mean not to mention the Android 5 and\nAndroid 6 or both out.\n\n298\n00:16:27.604 --> 00:16:31.400\nAndroid 7 is really just on\none device right now I think.\n\n299\n00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.350\nSo you've got these huge updates that\nhave come out since this phone is\n\n300\n00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.640\ngoing on sale and\nthey haven't been applied here.\n\n301\n00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.560\nAnd the reason is either the original\nvendor, Asus in this case,\n\n302\n00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.190\nmay not have released the update.\n\n303\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:47.450\nOr maybe the vendor did, but\nthe carrier hasn't approved it yet.\n\n304\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.280\nIf AT&amp;T hasn't approved it yet, I'm not\ngonna get that update on this phone.\n\n305\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.070\nAnd so there might be vulnerabilities\non this phone that I can't patch.\n\n306\n00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.640\nAnd as a business, if you're allowing\npeople to bring their own devices in,\n\n307\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.622\nyou got to set a minimum barrier.\n\n308\n00:17:00.622 --> 00:17:03.830\nIf you got to be this tall to ride\nthis ride, that kind of thing, is hey,\n\n309\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.756\nif you're gonna bring an Android phones,\n\n310\n00:17:05.756 --> 00:17:08.178\nthere got to be at least this\nversion of the OS to play.\n\n311\n00:17:08.178 --> 00:17:10.800\nOtherwise you're not allowed\nto use it on a network.\n\n312\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.450\nAnd most people don't have systems in\nplace to prevent that type of access.\n\n313\n00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:18.500\nBut you really need it, you've got\nto set that set of restrictions.\n\n314\n00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.496\nSame thing goes for jailbreaks like, hey,\nI'm not going to allow jailbroken devices\n\n315\n00:17:22.496 --> 00:17:26.339\non my network cuz they're intentionally\nweakened and that's a problem, right?\n\n316\n00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:29.490\nSo we gotta make sure we take\na stance on that in our business.\n\n317\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.217\nAnd in the next episode, we're gonna\ntalk mobile device management and\n\n318\n00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:33.209\nwe'll see how to do that.\n\n319\n00:17:33.209 --> 00:17:37.968\nHow to make sure we prevent those types\nof devices from getting onto our network.\n\n320\n00:17:37.968 --> 00:17:42.948\nAll right, so I talked a little\nbit about some of the exploits.\n\n321\n00:17:42.948 --> 00:17:47.010\nAnother thing I wanna talk about is\nhow an attack is formulated, right?\n\n322\n00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.870\nSo I mentioned if you wanted to attack\nmy phone, here's something you could do.\n\n323\n00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.650\nThat's great cuz you've\nbeen watching this show and\n\n324\n00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.380\nI've kind of told you stuff, right?\n\n325\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.960\nBut what if you didn't\nknow a single thing?\n\n326\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.683\nWhat if you just decided you wanted\nto attach Ronnie's phone, but\n\n327\n00:17:58.683 --> 00:18:00.687\nyou don't know a single\nthing about that phone.\n\n328\n00:18:00.687 --> 00:18:03.665\nCuz much more smarter than I,\nhe hasn't shown his phone on the show yet.\n\n329\n00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:04.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n330\n00:18:04.177 --> 00:18:08.199\nif we wanted to attack Ronnie's phone,\nwe'd have to start from scratch.\n\n331\n00:18:08.199 --> 00:18:11.874\nAnd there's this kinda generally\naccepted five phase method for\n\n332\n00:18:11.874 --> 00:18:14.010\nperforming a network attack.\n\n333\n00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.520\nAnd it applies for\nservers and desktops and\n\n334\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.490\nlaptops just the same as it does for\ncell phones and other devices.\n\n335\n00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:24.720\nThat if I'm targeting the company,\nI'm gonna go through five phases, right?\n\n336\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.499\nAnd the first phase is the most\neffective and also the easiest, and\n\n337\n00:18:29.499 --> 00:18:32.840\nthat simply gathering information, right?\n\n338\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.750\nThe first phase is what's called\nreconnaissance and to learn information.\n\n339\n00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.240\nWhat phone does Ronnie have?\n\n340\n00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.270\nWell I don't know, maybe I can go back and\nwatch a few episodes of the show, and\n\n341\n00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.820\nmaybe at some point he holds up his phone.\n\n342\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.010\nOr I can watch while it's live during\na break and maybe he checks his email and\n\n343\n00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:51.450\nI can just see what that phone is, or I\ncan look for footage like that somewhere.\n\n344\n00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.197\nMaybe I can see if I've ever\ngotten an email from him and\n\n345\n00:18:54.197 --> 00:18:56.727\nhis signature says sent\nfrom my Galaxy whatever.\n\n346\n00:18:56.727 --> 00:18:59.274\nThat kind of stuff, people do that, right?\n\n347\n00:18:59.274 --> 00:19:00.579\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The little signatures in their phone.\n\n348\n00:19:00.579 --> 00:19:04.650\nAnd it's innocuous enough,\nit's an innocent little communication.\n\n349\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.607\nBut it's giving away data, it's saying\nthis is the type of phone I run.\n\n350\n00:19:07.607 --> 00:19:10.580\nBy the way, if you want to attack me,\nhey, I'm using Outlook for mobile.\n\n351\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.203\nIf you want to attack me here\nis my application, right?\n\n352\n00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:14.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're sharing information too much,\n\n353\n00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:15.485\nright?\n\n354\n00:19:15.485 --> 00:19:19.740\nSo that's part of what reconnaissance is,\nand it doesn't even have to be high tech.\n\n355\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.335\nYou can be dumpster diving, right?\n\n356\n00:19:21.335 --> 00:19:26.048\nI can just go and dig through the trash\ncan in Ronnie office and maybe I can find\n\n357\n00:19:26.048 --> 00:19:31.220\ninformation there that helps clue me in on\nhis devices, or just about him himself.\n\n358\n00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.490\nBecause maybe I went to\nattack an iCloud account.\n\n359\n00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:39.199\nSo I might not have his password, but if\nI get his verification questions, right?\n\n360\n00:19:39.199 --> 00:19:42.889\nWhat your mothers may have a name or what\nyour birthday, that kind of stuff and you\n\n361\n00:19:42.889 --> 00:19:46.581\ncan find that a day into somebody's trash\nas a several high profile instances and\n\n362\n00:19:46.581 --> 00:19:47.742\nover the years, right?\n\n363\n00:19:47.742 --> 00:19:51.121\nSo that's kind of first step,\nit's just gathering information and\n\n364\n00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:54.673\nyou might be able to find an off right\nthere without even having to get into\n\n365\n00:19:54.673 --> 00:19:58.014\na computer really to then formulate\nwhat attack you're gonna use.\n\n366\n00:19:58.014 --> 00:20:02.550\nAll right, next, if that doesn't pan out,\nwe move into the scanning.\n\n367\n00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:06.762\nThe scanning side is like an extension\nof reconnaissance, right?\n\n368\n00:20:06.762 --> 00:20:09.580\nWe're trying to dig deeper into\nthe device and learn more about it.\n\n369\n00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.100\nWe're actually gonna contact\nthe device this time, right?\n\n370\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.190\nAnd the easiest way to do that is\nthrough a scanning application,\n\n371\n00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.675\nsomething like Nmap, right?\n\n372\n00:20:18.675 --> 00:20:22.334\nNmap, a lot of you guys have probably used\nas part of the Kali Linux distribution.\n\n373\n00:20:22.334 --> 00:20:26.065\nWell it's all an independent thing\nif you have Kali Linux built in.\n\n374\n00:20:26.065 --> 00:20:30.905\nSo for example, if I want to,\nlet me get out of this Android phone\n\n375\n00:20:30.905 --> 00:20:35.399\nhere real quick, and let me fire up,\nzenmap, there we go.\n\n376\n00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:40.022\nSo zenmap which is a fairly\nsimple application,\n\n377\n00:20:40.022 --> 00:20:46.909\nwhat it does is zenmap is the GUI for\nNmap, and Nmap is a network scanner.\n\n378\n00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:49.560\nIt lets you scan a network and\nfind devices.\n\n379\n00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.680\nAnd so I can look out on my network and\ntry and\n\n380\n00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.120\nfind systems that are out there,\nand learn more about them.\n\n381\n00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.990\nSo I know Ronnie's phone is\non the wireless network here.\n\n382\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.438\nSo what I can do is I can come through and\nI can tell it like hey,\n\n383\n00:21:04.438 --> 00:21:06.720\nI wanna scan the network here.\n\n384\n00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.932\nAnd I'm gonna tell it just to do a quick,\nlike a ping scan, right?\n\n385\n00:21:09.932 --> 00:21:12.959\nSo I'm gonna do a ping sweep across\nthis network and look for devices,\n\n386\n00:21:12.959 --> 00:21:14.460\njust a quick scan.\n\n387\n00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.742\nAnd as we scan,iIt's gonna hit devices,\nand when it finds them,\n\n388\n00:21:17.742 --> 00:21:19.335\nit will know their MAC address.\n\n389\n00:21:19.335 --> 00:21:21.931\nAnd based on their MAC address,\nwe can figure out who the manufacturer is.\n\n390\n00:21:21.931 --> 00:21:24.881\nAnd so I can look for Samsung,\nI can look for Apple, I can look for\n\n391\n00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:28.121\nAsus, and those are hints that I'm\ngonna be finding mobile devices.\n\n392\n00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:30.542\nAnd then beyond that,\nwe can start to identify other devices.\n\n393\n00:21:30.542 --> 00:21:34.710\nSo shoot, I chose an entire class B-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n394\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:35.766\n&gt;&gt; So this is gonna take forever.\n\n395\n00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:38.610\nBut it will scan through and\nstart to give me readouts on that.\n\n396\n00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.400\nThat's part of what we do as\npart of our actual scanning.\n\n397\n00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.669\nAnd once we find devices and we start\ngetting hits on this, from there we\n\n398\n00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:51.309\ncan jump in and say, okay, what I need to\ndo now is I need to do an intense scan.\n\n399\n00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:53.825\nAnd you'll see these other\nscan types that I've got here.\n\n400\n00:21:53.825 --> 00:21:55.775\nIntense scans plus UDP and so\n\n401\n00:21:55.775 --> 00:21:59.604\non, that we can start to really\nfigure out what we want.\n\n402\n00:21:59.604 --> 00:22:02.739\nAnd there's a lot of things that\nare not as easy as a drop down.\n\n403\n00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:05.453\nSo for example, if I know there's\na device out there, there we go, so\n\n404\n00:22:05.453 --> 00:22:06.198\nit's just a scan.\n\n405\n00:22:06.198 --> 00:22:10.592\nBut if I notice a device I can do an\noperating system fingerprint where you do\n\n406\n00:22:10.592 --> 00:22:11.725\na -O, I believe.\n\n407\n00:22:11.725 --> 00:22:12.349\nWhere it says hey,\n\n408\n00:22:12.349 --> 00:22:15.180\nlook at this installation figure out\nwhat operating system it's running.\n\n409\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.375\nAnd we'll see if it's Android or\niOS or Windows or whatever and\n\n410\n00:22:18.375 --> 00:22:22.008\nhelp us again continue targeting,\nand you can final that by scanning.\n\n411\n00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:25.450\nNow, looking at what I found here,\nhere we go.\n\n412\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.918\nIt found a number of devices and\nhere's an Apple device.\n\n413\n00:22:27.918 --> 00:22:32.500\nCould be a iMac or a MacBook,\ncould be an iPhone, right?\n\n414\n00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:37.564\nBut as we keep looking,\nwe'll start to find other ones that may be\n\n415\n00:22:37.564 --> 00:22:42.720\nare tied to Samsung or somebody else\nthat we know is a mobile phone,\n\n416\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.778\nsomething like sync mold enterprise.\n\n417\n00:22:45.778 --> 00:22:46.551\nI never even heard of that.\n\n418\n00:22:46.551 --> 00:22:48.023\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's one we'll look up and\n\n419\n00:22:48.023 --> 00:22:49.136\nfind out what the heck that is.\n\n420\n00:22:49.136 --> 00:22:52.239\nBut you really start to get an idea for\n\n421\n00:22:52.239 --> 00:22:56.460\nwhat these devices are and\nwhich ones are phones.\n\n422\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.431\nWhich ones are mobile devices\nthat we can start to target.\n\n423\n00:22:58.431 --> 00:23:02.324\nSo scanning, there's a number of different\nutilities out there that you can use,\n\n424\n00:23:02.324 --> 00:23:05.237\na number of different suites,\nNmap is one of the more common.\n\n425\n00:23:05.237 --> 00:23:08.550\nAll right, after that,\nwe move in to our third phase.\n\n426\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.913\nOnce you found a device\nthat you wanna target, so\n\n427\n00:23:10.913 --> 00:23:14.560\nI find an android device on the network\nthen we need to gain access, right?\n\n428\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.580\nAnd gaining access is the hardest part.\n\n429\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.684\nNow I wanna actually exploit some\nvulnerability in that phone to\n\n430\n00:23:19.684 --> 00:23:20.381\ngain access.\n\n431\n00:23:20.381 --> 00:23:22.923\nOr I can go old school and\nsteal the phone.\n\n432\n00:23:22.923 --> 00:23:23.423\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n433\n00:23:23.423 --> 00:23:24.653\nWe can go from physical also,\n\n434\n00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:26.101\nthat works too, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n435\n00:23:26.101 --> 00:23:27.397\n&gt;&gt; It's all fair game.\n\n436\n00:23:27.397 --> 00:23:29.051\nSo those are what we're gonna be showing\n\n437\n00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:32.166\nin the next couple of episodes, is ways\nto actually exploit those phones and\n\n438\n00:23:32.166 --> 00:23:34.390\ngain access,\nthat's kind of that next step.\n\n439\n00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.839\nAnd once you've gained access, then you\nmove into what your actual intent is.\n\n440\n00:23:37.839 --> 00:23:41.545\nYou maintain access so that you\ncan grab data or leak information,\n\n441\n00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:45.912\nmonitor, surveil, whatever it is that\nyour intent is to get into the device,\n\n442\n00:23:45.912 --> 00:23:47.122\nthat's what you do.\n\n443\n00:23:47.122 --> 00:23:49.281\nAnd then the last phase is\ncovering your tracks, right?\n\n444\n00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:51.988\nYou clear the log files,\nyou hide the evidence,\n\n445\n00:23:51.988 --> 00:23:55.035\nremove any evidence that you\nwere in the device at all.\n\n446\n00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:57.809\nAnd now you're off and\nyou go undetected, right?\n\n447\n00:23:57.809 --> 00:23:59.121\nSo that's kind of the whole\ngoal of an attack.\n\n448\n00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:03.628\nSo when it comes to formulating an attack,\nIf you know the device you're targeting,\n\n449\n00:24:03.628 --> 00:24:04.700\nthat makes it easy.\n\n450\n00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.737\nWe can look at exploits that are known for\nthat device,\n\n451\n00:24:07.737 --> 00:24:10.390\nlike Metasploit is packed full of them.\n\n452\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.330\nWe can look at change logs from\nthe operating system vendors.\n\n453\n00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.780\nWe can formulate our own attacks,\n\n454\n00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.270\nbased on just knowledge that we have of\nthat user and how they use the device.\n\n455\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.560\nMaybe I know Ronnie is jail broken.\n\n456\n00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.790\nSo I know he's probably\nrunning SSH on his phone.\n\n457\n00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.670\nAnd so I know I can start doing attacks\nhere, or maybe just a brute force.\n\n458\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.240\nThat is something that I might be able to\ndo, if I know how he's using the phone.\n\n459\n00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.580\nSo the information we have that's really\ngonna impact how we formulate our attack.\n\n460\n00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.330\n&gt;&gt; All right Don.\n\n461\n00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.960\nYou have really talked\nabout the importance\n\n462\n00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.280\nto help mitigate some of these attacks,\nabout updating and patching these systems.\n\n463\n00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.810\nBut normally inside of a network,\nwe also test these types of updates and\n\n464\n00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.660\nthese systems as we push them out.\n\n465\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.340\nAnd then we go, we'll release them\nwhen we feel like they're ready.\n\n466\n00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.010\nIs there something like that for\nmobile phones that we can do?\n\n467\n00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.730\n&gt;&gt; There is, it's trickier, right?\n\n468\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.220\nIt's harder, especially if you\nget the carriers involved, right?\n\n469\n00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.800\nIf you have iOS devices, it's nice,\n\n470\n00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.300\ncuz the carriers are not\ninvolved in your updates.\n\n471\n00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.310\nApple is.\n\n472\n00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.590\nAnd when Apple releases an update,\nhey it's available.\n\n473\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.306\nAnd they've got a beta program that\nanybody can be a part of and so\n\n474\n00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:10.840\nas a security administrator,\nyou should be a part of that.\n\n475\n00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.445\nSo that you're getting the beta\napplications on your phone so\n\n476\n00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:15.520\nyou can test it out for your environment.\n\n477\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.640\nAnd that way you know if all of your\nbusiness applications work properly, and\n\n478\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.280\nif they do, then you know you're\ngonna be ready when it rolls out.\n\n479\n00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.730\nBecause when it rolls out,\nyou can't stop the flood, right?\n\n480\n00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.170\nApple immediately contacts those\ndevices and starts to push that update.\n\n481\n00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.940\nBut you can leverage things like\nApple's MDM products to be able to control\n\n482\n00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.100\nwhen a phone gets the update and\neven require it.\n\n483\n00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:36.980\nYou can force it.\n\n484\n00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.520\nBecause a normal user, okay,\nI've done this myself, right?\n\n485\n00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.300\nYou get up in the morning,\nyou pick up your phone, and it says, hey,\n\n486\n00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.620\nthere's a update to iOS.\n\n487\n00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.200\nDo you wanna install it now?\n\n488\n00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.410\nOr remind me later.\n\n489\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:47.359\nLet's remind me later.\n\n490\n00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:48.878\nI don't want to deal with that right now.\n\n491\n00:25:48.878 --> 00:25:52.410\nWell, if it's a critical update,\nyou don't want to remind somebody later.\n\n492\n00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:53.990\nYou want to do it right now.\n\n493\n00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.040\nIf you've got mobile device management,\nyou can do that.\n\n494\n00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.080\nSo we'll see that in the next episode.\n\n495\n00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.060\nWith Android, it's harder.\n\n496\n00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.955\nIt's harder because\nthe carriers are involved.\n\n497\n00:26:02.955 --> 00:26:07.120\nThat if I've got a Galaxy S7 from AT&amp;T and\n\n498\n00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.350\nI've got another Galaxy S7 from Verizon,\nand you see\n\n499\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.530\nwhere Samsung pushes an update, I've got\nto wait for the carriers to approve it.\n\n500\n00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:20.030\nAnd AT&amp;T might approve it today and\nVerizon might wait a week.\n\n501\n00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.130\nSo, that makes it a challenge.\n\n502\n00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:23.370\nThat makes it much more\ndifficult to push those out.\n\n503\n00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.288\nAnd a lot of those are delivered as\nover the air updates or OTAs and\n\n504\n00:26:26.288 --> 00:26:29.970\nthose OTAs are completely\ndetermined by the carrier.\n\n505\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.070\nIf you wanna take control of it,\nvery challenging, right?\n\n506\n00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.660\nAndroid phones are actually very\ndifficult to manage because of that.\n\n507\n00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.350\nAnd some of them are getting\nbetter about it but some aren't.\n\n508\n00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.448\nI know a lot of people say, well,\nlet's take the carrier out of the mix.\n\n509\n00:26:41.448 --> 00:26:43.000\nI'm gonna buy unlocked phones.\n\n510\n00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.950\nAnd Samsung did it with the Galaxy S7,\n\n511\n00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:49.670\nthey had the Android edition\nthat wasn't tied to a carrier.\n\n512\n00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.130\nWell, guess what, they've pushed\nout Android 7 to the ones that\n\n513\n00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.740\nare on carriers, and\nnot to the unlocked ones, right now.\n\n514\n00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.360\nSo the unlocked ones\nare actually further behind than\n\n515\n00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.290\nthe ones that are tied\nto a carrier right now.\n\n516\n00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:05.490\nThat's not a common scenario but it does\nhappen, so you're kinda at their mercy and\n\n517\n00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.750\nthat's where it's really tricky.\n\n518\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.710\nYou gotta stay on top of exploits.\n\n519\n00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:12.810\nAnd if there's an exploit for devices that\nyou have rolled out in your environment,\n\n520\n00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.480\nyou gotta do one of two things,\neither one,\n\n521\n00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.480\nyou got to pressure the carrier\nto release the patch for that.\n\n522\n00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.620\nOr patch it yourself somehow.\n\n523\n00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.160\nOr two,\ndiscontinue the use of that device.\n\n524\n00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.140\nThis device I love for this show because\nit helps me to highlight problems.\n\n525\n00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.040\nI would not recommend this device in\nproduction and in fact I don't this is my\n\n526\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.370\nold phone because when it stopped\ngetting updates, I bought a new phone.\n\n527\n00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:34.270\nThat's what I did.\n\n528\n00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:38.510\nAnd it stinks that I had to do that but,\nthat's it, if you're not gonna get updates\n\n529\n00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:42.900\nyou can't keep using that phone if\nyou're sensitive about your data.\n\n530\n00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.230\nIf you don't want your data getting any\nupdate, you can't use an old device.\n\n531\n00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.220\nSo that's an important thing and\nI guess that's something I haven't really\n\n532\n00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.880\nmentioned is, there are people out\nthere where two years have gone by,\n\n533\n00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.760\nthere contract is up, and\nthey're eligible to get a new phone for\n\n534\n00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.840\nfree, but they don't cuz they\nlike theirs and it still works.\n\n535\n00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.460\nWell that's nice but,\nis it still getting updates?\n\n536\n00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.500\nBecause most vendors don't continue\nupdating their devices beyond\n\n537\n00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.830\nthe two years that you have it.\n\n538\n00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.330\nApple's kind of the exception to that, but\n\n539\n00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.900\neven Apple will eventually\nstop updating a device.\n\n540\n00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.880\nAnd when that happens, it doesn't matter\nif that device is working perfectly fine.\n\n541\n00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.340\nIt's time for you to stop using it.\n\n542\n00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.940\nSo we have to have a lifecycle in our\ncompany, a lifecycle where we dictate,\n\n543\n00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.540\neven it if it's bring your own device,\nthat eventually,\n\n544\n00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.610\nif your device is no longer\nsupported by the original vendor,\n\n545\n00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.920\nthen it's no longer supported\non the business network.\n\n546\n00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.640\nThat's all stuff that we have to\nimplement to protect our environment.\n\n547\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nwell that's a lot of information for\n\n548\n00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:39.370\nus to consider when we have these\nunmanaged mobile devices on our network.\n\n549\n00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:41.860\nAnd it's something that we should\ntake a little bit of time and\n\n550\n00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:46.570\na little bit of effort to go into as\nyou start to get into the business and\n\n551\n00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.190\nworking with these devices.\n\n552\n00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.929\nSo running in this episode, Don really\ndid show us the way that Android,\n\n553\n00:28:51.929 --> 00:28:55.090\nat this point,\nhow some of those protections built in.\n\n554\n00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.100\nHe also showed us,\n\n555\n00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.330\nof course, the ability to see where the\nattack is formulated and how that's done,\n\n556\n00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:03.650\nand emphasize the importance of the\nmitigations factors that we all have to\n\n557\n00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:07.380\nconsider, as we work with these devices\ninside of our own managed environment.\n\n558\n00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.345\nUnmanaged devices inside of our managed\nenvironments, after this demonstration,\n\n559\n00:29:11.345 --> 00:29:13.667\nseems like a bad idea,\nDon, is all it seems like.\n\n560\n00:29:13.667 --> 00:29:17.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, I mean, it's the\ndifference between how we can use a device\n\n561\n00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.765\nas consumer versus how we can use\na device in an enterprise organization.\n\n562\n00:29:20.765 --> 00:29:22.735\nIt's very different and\nit really shouldn't be.\n\n563\n00:29:22.735 --> 00:29:26.615\nAs a consumer, we should be more security\nconscious but most people aren't, right?\n\n564\n00:29:26.615 --> 00:29:29.950\nBut you have that luxury cuz if your\ndata gets compromised, it's just you.\n\n565\n00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.900\nBut in an enterprise,\nif you get compromised,\n\n566\n00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.109\nit's the entire enterprise\nthat gets compromised.\n\n567\n00:29:34.109 --> 00:29:37.162\nSo that's the big difference, it seems\nscary but it's the reality of things.\n\n568\n00:29:37.162 --> 00:29:40.150\nThe risk is greater in\na corporate environment.\n\n569\n00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:43.590\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a great\nplace for us to sign off then Don.\n\n570\n00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.950\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n571\n00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:47.990\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n572\n00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:51.430\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more emerging\ntechnologies security demonstrations.\n\n573\n00:29:51.430 -->

According to Don, this enrollment allows us to create security and management policies for these device that can help secure devices that have company data on them.  He demonstrates not only the enrollment and policy creation but also the actions that can be taken when we discover a device maybe compromised.",

00:00:08.240\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.050\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.912\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:15.783\nYou're watching another segment\n\n7\n00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:18.626\non Emerging Technology\nSecurity Demonstrations.\n\n8\n00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:23.867\nWe're specifically gonna be diving into\nmanaging these devices with well, MDM.\n\n9\n00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:26.777\nAnd here to help us out,\nis gonna be Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:29.720\nDon, what in the world is an MDM?\n\n11\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.843\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, if you've\nbeen watching all of our episodes.\n\n12\n00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:36.164\nIn the last one we talked about the risks\nof bringing a unmanaged device into your\n\n13\n00:00:36.164 --> 00:00:40.960\nbusiness, in your organization and all the\ndifferent things that that exposes you to.\n\n14\n00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.468\nWell in this episode, we wanna talk\nabout one of the solutions to that, and\n\n15\n00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:46.938\nthat is Mobile Device Management or MDM.\n\n16\n00:00:46.938 --> 00:00:51.960\nWhat MDM is,\nis centralized software that can control\n\n17\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.100\nthese phones and tablets and other\ndevices that are coming on your network.\n\n18\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.584\nThese are devices that you don’t\nnecessarily own that maybe the property of\n\n19\n00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:03.078\nyour employees or students or whoever\nthis participating in your network.\n\n20\n00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:07.060\nBut that will grant you the ability\nto control certain aspects especially\n\n21\n00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.870\nsecurity aspects of those devices.\n\n22\n00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.660\nThis is really critical because normally\nwhen somebody brings their own phone and\n\n23\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.570\njoins in your wireless network,\nyou have no control over them at all.\n\n24\n00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.840\nWith an MDM, an MDM lets you\nkind of create a partnership.\n\n25\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.320\nA partnership between you and\nthat employee or you and that student,\n\n26\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.560\nor whoever to say, it's your phone,\nyou can have it, you can do what you want.\n\n27\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.090\nBut you're gonna allow me to take a few\nactions on the phone to be able to\n\n28\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.660\ndo things like remotely erase\nthe phone in case it gets lost or\n\n29\n00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.190\nstolen, or\nenforce a security policy on it.\n\n30\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.520\nYou can still do what you want,\n\n31\n00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.030\nbut we're gonna impose these\nrules upon it using the MDM.\n\n32\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.486\nThat's what it does, and\nit helps to reduce the risk of bringing\n\n33\n00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:51.779\nin those unmanaged devices, but still\nallow people to have their own systems.\n\n34\n00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.926\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, so let's say that on\nmy network I've decided that that's\n\n35\n00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:58.720\nwhat we wanna do, we wanna allow these\nunmanaged devices to be on our network.\n\n36\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.160\nYou're giving me this idea that I\ncan do some type of control with it.\n\n37\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.959\nWhat do I need to do to get\nimplemented here and to get started?\n\n38\n00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.310\nThe first thing we need to do is we need\nto pick an MDM, and there's a ton of them.\n\n39\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.921\nIf you do a Google search for MDM, you'll\nfind 30 different companies that make it.\n\n40\n00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:15.171\nMany of them are free or\nbuilt into products you already have.\n\n41\n00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:18.280\nSo for example,\nif you have Microsoft Exchange, and\n\n42\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.779\nyou're using that for your email server.\n\n43\n00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.919\nExchange can actually do MDM, it can lock\ndown devices and remote erase and so on,\n\n44\n00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.040\nfor device that are connected\nto the Exchange server.\n\n45\n00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.910\nAnd it can manage iPhone and\nAndroid as well as Windows mobile, so\n\n46\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.410\nit's actually very powerful for\nthat if you have Microsoft Exchange.\n\n47\n00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.630\nOr if you are a all Apple environment,\nand you have a Mac OS or\n\n48\n00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.350\nOS X server somewhere, inside of the OS X\nserver app, you can set up a MDM.\n\n49\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.599\nIt's built into the server app.\n\n50\n00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.276\nAnd again, you can lock down phones and\nremote wipe them and so on,\n\n51\n00:02:50.276 --> 00:02:51.796\nbut it only works with iOS.\n\n52\n00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:55.871\nThat's kind of the trick, is you've got\nto find a solution that manages all of\n\n53\n00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:58.669\nthe different devices that\nyou expect to encounter.\n\n54\n00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:03.270\nBecause if you even let one person go\nunmanaged then everything falls apart,\n\n55\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.780\nright?\n\n56\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.302\nSecurity is all about defense in-depth and\n\n57\n00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:09.991\nyour security is only as strong\nas the weakest link in the chain.\n\n58\n00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:13.184\nSo if there's one little spot that\nyou allow somebody to get in and\n\n59\n00:03:13.184 --> 00:03:16.724\nsomebody comes in and say, hey,\nlook I've got this, I don't know,\n\n60\n00:03:16.724 --> 00:03:18.367\nlike a Nokia phone or something.\n\n61\n00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:21.152\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I don't wanna run Android or iOS,\n\n62\n00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:22.196\nI wanna run this.\n\n63\n00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:25.260\nAnd he say, all right,\nwell I guess I'll let you in unmanaged.\n\n64\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.590\nWell now that becomes an attack vector,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.017\nSomebody could use that\nto get in the system.\n\n66\n00:03:29.017 --> 00:03:31.804\nSo with an MDM we can enforce things like,\nhey,\n\n67\n00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:35.780\nwe're not gonna give you a wireless\ncertificate unless you meet our\n\n68\n00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.540\nrequirements that you run this particular\nOS or this version or higher and so on.\n\n69\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.593\nThat's what the MDM does, right?\n\n70\n00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:45.790\nSo we need to select which one we're\ngoing to use, and for this show,\n\n71\n00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.944\njust as a demonstration, I'm gonna use a\nproduct called AirWatch, it's from VMware.\n\n72\n00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:52.302\nVMware's known for\ntheir virtualization platform.\n\n73\n00:03:52.302 --> 00:03:55.550\nI like AirWatch because it's quick and\neasy, it's web based.\n\n74\n00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.470\nIt runs on their systems,\nsoftware as a service.\n\n75\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.897\nSo you can go to the AirWatch website,\nset up a demo and be up and\n\n76\n00:04:00.897 --> 00:04:01.892\nrunning in ten minutes.\n\n77\n00:04:01.892 --> 00:04:04.394\nAnd after that,\nwe just need to connect our devices to it,\n\n78\n00:04:04.394 --> 00:04:05.989\nwe can start managing them, right?\n\n79\n00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.630\nAnd that act of connecting a device\nto your MDM, that's called enrolling.\n\n80\n00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.010\nWe enroll a device to\nbe centrally managed.\n\n81\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.667\nAnd the important thing here is\nthat if it's a customer device,\n\n82\n00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:19.372\nthey can choose to unenroll.\n\n83\n00:04:19.372 --> 00:04:21.730\nAll right, they can say I don't\nwant to be maintenance anymore, and\n\n84\n00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.710\nthey can unenroll.\n\n85\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.859\nNow when that happens, we can take a few\nactions, like we can remove things.\n\n86\n00:04:26.859 --> 00:04:27.567\nFor example,\n\n87\n00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:31.698\nif I have a wireless network that requires\na certificate to be able to join, right?\n\n88\n00:04:31.698 --> 00:04:34.819\nIf it's doing WPA2 Enterprise,\nwell I can say,\n\n89\n00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.180\nwhen you enroll I give\nyou the certificate.\n\n90\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.690\nAnd then as soon as you unenroll I\ntake the certificate away, right?\n\n91\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.960\nAnd MDM can do that.\n\n92\n00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.370\nSo now they're no longer able to\nparticipate on your wireless network and\n\n93\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.190\nthey're on their own.\n\n94\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.980\nIt's their own phone, they can do\nwhatever they want with it, right?\n\n95\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.638\nBut if they don't let\nyou centrally manage it,\n\n96\n00:04:49.638 --> 00:04:51.428\nyou're not gonna let them on the network,\nright?\n\n97\n00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:54.480\nThis is the only way that we\ncan have a secure network, and\n\n98\n00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.730\nstill allow people to have\ntheir own devices, right?\n\n99\n00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.615\nSo we need to get those devices enrolled,\nand\n\n100\n00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:01.310\nthat's what I wanna show you guys here.\n\n101\n00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.550\nI wanna take a device and get it enrolled\nto be managed, and the process is usually\n\n102\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.188\npretty painless, but\ndifferent products work different ways.\n\n103\n00:05:07.188 --> 00:05:11.466\nFor example, Microsoft Exchange when you\nlaunch Outlook on the phone and you login\n\n104\n00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:15.639\nto the Exchange Server the first time,\nit automatically enrolls it in that MDM.\n\n105\n00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.200\nSo it's done through the email client for\nthat.\n\n106\n00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.110\nBut for AirWatch and for\nmost of the others, they use an agent, and\n\n107\n00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.660\nagent that has to be\ninstalled on the phone.\n\n108\n00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.525\nNow I'm logged into the AirWatch\ncontrol panel here, so\n\n109\n00:05:27.525 --> 00:05:29.560\nthis is what the central hub looks like.\n\n110\n00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.709\nSo as an administrator, I sit down I log\nin and I can see a quick status of my\n\n111\n00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:38.146\ndevices, how many devices I got registered\nand I can start to work with them.\n\n112\n00:05:38.146 --> 00:05:40.270\nWell I want to enroll a new device, right?\n\n113\n00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.197\nSo Bob, and accounting comes in and says,\nhey, I got a new phone, it's awesome!\n\n114\n00:05:44.197 --> 00:05:46.440\nCan I use them on the company network?\n\n115\n00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.109\nAnd we say, all right, well yes.\n\n116\n00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:51.320\nYes, you can, if you enroll it for us to\nbe able to manage the security policy.\n\n117\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.371\nBob says hey,\nI'm fine with that let's do it.\n\n118\n00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:56.730\nAll right, we'll just go up here\nto add and I'm gonna add a device.\n\n119\n00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.960\nAnd when I add that device, I just need to\ncome through and tie it to a user, right.\n\n120\n00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.138\nSo I would have Bob to find my system.\n\n121\n00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:06.720\nAirWatch ties into Active Directory and\na few other things.\n\n122\n00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.180\nSo if you have a user database in there,\n\n123\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.080\nI've just got a sample user\ndatabase I'll pick myself here.\n\n124\n00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.160\nSo I'm going to pick, me,\nand then I'll come down and\n\n125\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.050\nspecify information about the device,\nright?\n\n126\n00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.927\nSo I'm gonna call this one,\nI will call it Don's iPhone or\n\n127\n00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:23.649\nwhatever happens to be,\nthis is just a friendly name.\n\n128\n00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.702\nSo I can remember what it is, so I'll call\nit Don's iPhone, it's part of ITPro.TV,\n\n129\n00:06:27.702 --> 00:06:30.130\nand then here is the important thing.\n\n130\n00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.527\nI need to pick whether it's corporate\ndedicated, corporate shared or\n\n131\n00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:36.150\nemployee owned, right?\n\n132\n00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.020\nNow what's the difference on this?\n\n133\n00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.130\nWell, I might want to allow\nsomebody who owns their own phone,\n\n134\n00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.430\nI might want them to be able to unenroll,\nright?\n\n135\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.830\nSo if Bob decides hey, I don’t wanna\nuse it on the company network anymore,\n\n136\n00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.620\nhe can choose to unenroll.\n\n137\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.688\nBut if the company bought the phone, if we\nbought it, that is corporate dedicated.\n\n138\n00:06:57.688 --> 00:06:59.966\nWe just bought it for the company, and so\n\n139\n00:06:59.966 --> 00:07:02.517\nI don't want to allow\nthat to be unenrolled.\n\n140\n00:07:02.517 --> 00:07:05.537\nIt's always gonna be apart of the MDM.\n\n141\n00:07:05.537 --> 00:07:10.677\nOr if it's corporate shared,\nnow it's both environments, right?\n\n142\n00:07:10.677 --> 00:07:13.900\nIt's maybe an employee owned phone,\nbut it's being used by the company or\n\n143\n00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.728\nwe split the cost.\n\n144\n00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd I might have a different policy there\nthat may or may not allow an enrollment or\n\n145\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.160\nother things, right?\n\n146\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.228\nSo you can set different\npolicies based on what you want.\n\n147\n00:07:21.228 --> 00:07:25.280\nI'm gonna designate that we'll go\ncorporate dedicated on this phone, right?\n\n148\n00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.469\nSo this phone is just straight\nup a corporate phone, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:30.040\nAnd then I can designate a platform.\n\n150\n00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.517\nNow AirWatch is really flexible,\nit supports a ton of platforms.\n\n151\n00:07:32.517 --> 00:07:36.499\nSo I could leave this empty, but if I drop\nthat down you'll see where I can pick from\n\n152\n00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:39.349\nall of the ones that they support and\nthey support a bunch.\n\n153\n00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:43.618\nAndroid, iOS, macOS, tvOS so\nyou can manage the Apple TVs,\n\n154\n00:07:43.618 --> 00:07:47.248\nBlackberries, all sorts of stuff in here,\nright?\n\n155\n00:07:47.248 --> 00:07:51.850\nWell in my case, I'm talking about\nan iPhone, so I would pick Apple iOS.\n\n156\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.840\nBut you might have an Android phone or\nsomething else, and\n\n157\n00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.270\nyou would choose what platform.\n\n158\n00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.564\nNow why does that matter?\n\n159\n00:07:56.564 --> 00:08:00.928\nWhat matters here is that with MDM we're\nreaching out and talking to the phone and\n\n160\n00:08:00.928 --> 00:08:03.186\ntrying to implement security features.\n\n161\n00:08:03.186 --> 00:08:06.883\nWell, there's some security features\non Android that aren't on iOS.\n\n162\n00:08:06.883 --> 00:08:09.820\nAnd there's some security features\non iOS that aren't on Android.\n\n163\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.400\nFor example, iCloud Lock,\nwith iCloud Lock,\n\n164\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.880\nI'm logged into an iPhone\nwith an iTunes account.\n\n165\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.710\nAnd then, if the phone ever gets stolen,\nnobody can factory reset it and\n\n166\n00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.030\nreprovision it,\nunless they have my iTunes account, right?\n\n167\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.380\nSo that's an activation lock\nthat's a part of that phone.\n\n168\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.520\nWe don't have that on Android,\nthat's on iPhone right?\n\n169\n00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.650\nSo on Android we have different\nthings to do activation lock.\n\n170\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.300\nAnd so each one kinda has a different\nmodel, so we can designate that here.\n\n171\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.960\nNow, I dont actually have to\ndesignate this or even get it right,\n\n172\n00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.770\nI could have left it at any.\n\n173\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.060\nAnd when the device enrolls it will\ndetect it and apply it properly.\n\n174\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.140\nSo while it is a required field,\nI could have left it at any and\n\n175\n00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.880\nit wold have been fine.\n\n176\n00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.050\nNow, once that's done, I can save that and\n\n177\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.590\nit's got where we can do messaging to send\npeople a message about it being enrolled.\n\n178\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.840\nCuz they need to attach it on their end,\nright?\n\n179\n00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.020\nBut, in my case, I'm gonna use something\non screen to be able to do this, so\n\n180\n00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.310\nI'll go ahead and save that.\n\n181\n00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.880\nAnd, what's gonna happen is,\nthat user is going to receive an email or\n\n182\n00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.000\na text message, or whatever method\nit is I choose to communicate it.\n\n183\n00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.240\nAnd when they do,\nit's going to have a link in there,\n\n184\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.870\nthat will let them attach\ntheir device to our MDM.\n\n185\n00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.580\nAnd that's an important part.\n\n186\n00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.000\nI'm gonna hit save here, and\nit's gonna send an email off to me.\n\n187\n00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.480\nSo I'll get an email here in just\na moment, that's gonna tell me about this\n\n188\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.350\nnew device that I've got,\nthat's ready to be enrolled, all right?\n\n189\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.540\nAnd then it will be time\nto enroll the device.\n\n190\n00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.530\nNow how do I enroll the device itself?\n\n191\n00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.610\nWell let me bring it up here on\nmy screen and I'll show you.\n\n192\n00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.669\nSo what I've got is an iPhone, and\n\n193\n00:09:40.669 --> 00:09:43.515\nI'm gonna just bring it\nup here any moment now.\n\n194\n00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:46.840\nThere is it, all right, so\nhere's my iPhone, okay?\n\n195\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.300\nAnd for this device if I want\nto enroll it in AirWatch,\n\n196\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.490\nwhat we install is the AirWatch Agent.\n\n197\n00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.300\nYou just go in the app store, it's\na free app, any of you could search for\n\n198\n00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.140\nit right now on Android or iOS.\n\n199\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.450\nYou go in the app stores, and\nyou'll find the AirWatch Agent.\n\n200\n00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:07.280\nAnd when you run the AirWatch Agent,\nit's going to offer to get enrolled.\n\n201\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.490\nAnd when you enroll,\nyou'll see there's two different ways.\n\n202\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.850\nYou can enroll by email address,\nby server details or by QR code.\n\n203\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.900\nAnd QR Code is by far the easiest.\n\n204\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.040\nIf we choose QR Code, what it's gonna\ndo is it's gonna turn on the camera,\n\n205\n00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.740\nand it's gonna let me scan a QR Code.\n\n206\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.340\nWell, remember that email\nI mentioned a moment ago?\n\n207\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.080\nI can feel my phone vibrating here.\n\n208\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.580\nSo I should have received an email.\n\n209\n00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.470\nI'm gonna check my email during the show,\nwhich is a violation of our policy.\n\n210\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:38.770\nBut sure enough,\nI'm looking at my physical phone here.\n\n211\n00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.610\nAnd I received an email with a QR code.\n\n212\n00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.700\nAnd so all I have to do is on this iPhone,\n\n213\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.470\nI'm gonna choose to scan the QR code,\nright?\n\n214\n00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.030\nSo if we look at my computer,\nyou'll see I've got my camera going.\n\n215\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.300\nI'm gonna give everybody\nmotion sickness here.\n\n216\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.900\nSo, seeing we can look around the studio,\nvery exciting.\n\n217\n00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.640\nAnd what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna take that.\n\n218\n00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.220\nAnd I guess if I hold the phone right,\nit won't go too crazy.\n\n219\n00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.220\nAnd I'm gonna scan the QR code,\nthere we go.\n\n220\n00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.100\nI'm scanning the QR code that\nwas emailed to the user.\n\n221\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.970\nNow what's happening is that\nQR code has the information,\n\n222\n00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:18.260\nthe security token to reach out and\ncontact that server.\n\n223\n00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.060\nAnd now it contacts the MDM and\n\n224\n00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.830\nsays I wanna get enrolled, I just\nneed to provide my user credentials.\n\n225\n00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.155\nSo I can authenticate right here,\nand as soon as I authenticate,\n\n226\n00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:30.540\nthen we will be tied to the system.\n\n227\n00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.950\nAll right, so I'm just gonna enter in my\npasscode here off camera for a second.\n\n228\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.630\nOtherwise, we'll have everybody managing\nmy phone by the end of the show.\n\n229\n00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.260\nAnd all right, there we go.\n\n230\n00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.710\nSo on my next screen, what we're\ngonna see is where it's basically\n\n231\n00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.580\nverifying whether I wanted to pick whether\nit was corporate or dedicated or whatever.\n\n232\n00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.500\nSo I can see right here,\n\n233\n00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.510\nit's already got corporate dedicated, cuz\nthat's what I chose in the initial setup.\n\n234\n00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:57.720\nAnd as we move forward, now it's going to\noffer to enable the device management.\n\n235\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.730\nNow see how the end user gets to choose,\nright?\n\n236\n00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:01.910\nThey could choose not to do this.\n\n237\n00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.300\nHey, I don't wanna participate in MDM,\n\n238\n00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.410\nthey own the phone,\nthey get to do it, right?\n\n239\n00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.230\nIf I was the IT department and\nthis was actually corporate-owned phone,\n\n240\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.870\nwe would receive the phone first.\n\n241\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.420\nAnd we'd enroll it before we\neven give it to the user.\n\n242\n00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.960\nBut in this case it's the user's phone.\n\n243\n00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.058\nAnd they are going to choose\nthat they do want to enable it.\n\n244\n00:12:17.058 --> 00:12:18.270\nNow when I click enable right here,\n\n245\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.720\nwhat I'm doing is I'm saying I'm gonna\ntrust the MDM to manage my phone.\n\n246\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.400\nAnd actually on the next screen, what I\nsee is probably the most important part.\n\n247\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.520\nInstall the profile, right,\nthe profile is really a certificate.\n\n248\n00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:36.870\nSee how it says signed by awmdm.com,\nthat's the AirWatch MDM from VMR.\n\n249\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.540\nAnd so I need to install that profile,\nnow the profile is going to contain\n\n250\n00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.490\nthe certificate as well as a set\nof restrictions for my phone.\n\n251\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.300\nThat dictates what I'm allowed to do and\nwhat I'm not allowed to do.\n\n252\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.980\nSo I'm just gonna install that profile.\n\n253\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.160\nNow I haven't configured a profile,\n\n254\n00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.619\nso right now it's really just\nconfiguring me trusting the MDM, okay?\n\n255\n00:12:55.619 --> 00:12:59.600\nAnd so now that that's done,\nI'm pretty good to go.\n\n256\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.322\nActually, apparently there is a profile\nof some sort it's offering to install.\n\n257\n00:13:03.322 --> 00:13:08.120\nI'll go ahead and trust that one, and\nas soon as that's done, there we go.\n\n258\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.970\nNow it is done and I can hit done.\n\n259\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.530\nAnd now my device is being managed.\n\n260\n00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.360\nCongratulations, I have completed\nthe initial configuration for my device.\n\n261\n00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.020\nSo now I'm enrolled, and\n\n262\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.830\nthis phone's officially being\nmanaged by my corporate MDM.\n\n263\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:26.540\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, now that it's enrolled\nand we've got this device ready to go,\n\n264\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:31.390\nwhat are we really looking to do inside\nthe MDM now that it's ready to go?\n\n265\n00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, well as an administrator\nnow, I can monitor the phone, right?\n\n266\n00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.720\nAnd I don't mean like monitor\nas in listen to the microphone.\n\n267\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.860\nI mean I can check its health, I can\nsee what version of iOS it's running.\n\n268\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.230\nI can see what apps are installed on it.\n\n269\n00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.750\nI can look for\nthings that I know are a problem.\n\n270\n00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.490\nFor example,\nmaybe I read a news article that says,\n\n271\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.230\nthe Facebook app has a massive\nremote exploit in it.\n\n272\n00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.250\nYou've got to update today, well,\n\n273\n00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.070\nI can pull up a list of all of my phones\nthat are running the Facebook app.\n\n274\n00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.140\nAnd I can look at what version or\nhave they already updated.\n\n275\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.900\nWe can identify those phones.\n\n276\n00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.340\nBut more importantly, I can start to\nrestrict what's allowed to be done on\n\n277\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.220\nthose phones, we can create profiles.\n\n278\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.010\nNow AirWatch uses some\ndifferent terminology here.\n\n279\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.114\nHere in AirWatch, you might have\nnoticed this link on the left side,\n\n280\n00:14:10.114 --> 00:14:11.180\nit says Blueprints.\n\n281\n00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.960\nAnd blueprints are their\nversion of profiles and\n\n282\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.830\nwhat a blueprint does is it defines\nwhat a phone is allowed to have on it.\n\n283\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.520\nAnd you can come in and create your own\ncustom blueprints based on a group, or\n\n284\n00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.560\na job role, or whatever.\n\n285\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.830\nSo, for example I might have salespeople.\n\n286\n00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.050\nSo I'm gonna create a blueprint\ncalled Salespeople, all right.\n\n287\n00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:39.510\nAnd in this blueprint, I can define\nwhat applications are allowed to be run.\n\n288\n00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.970\nSo I come in and I can add an app.\n\n289\n00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:45.920\nAnd maybe I want to add things like\nFacebook or Twitter or whatever.\n\n290\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.620\nWe can start to punch in those\napplications, you've got public\n\n291\n00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.158\napplications that are coming out of\nthe regular application store or web apps.\n\n292\n00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:55.840\nApps that come from a particular site,\nusually a third party.\n\n293\n00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.610\nBut in the app stores,\nI can choose Add and\n\n294\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.390\nI can punch in which app\nstores I wanna support.\n\n295\n00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:05.420\nWell, if all of my salespeople\nhave iPhones, I might choose,\n\n296\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.580\nonly choose Apple on this one.\n\n297\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.650\nBut you pick and choose based\non the devices that you manage.\n\n298\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.190\nAnd then which countries you're\nsupporting, here I'm doing US.\n\n299\n00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.990\nThen we can actually find\nthe apps that we're looking for.\n\n300\n00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.530\nSo I might be looking for Facebook,\nso I'll search for that one.\n\n301\n00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:26.585\nAnd I can tick off Facebook, right,\nand I can choose, is this a on demand?\n\n302\n00:15:26.585 --> 00:15:29.935\nIn other words, if the users want to\ndownload Facebook, yes, they're allowed.\n\n303\n00:15:29.935 --> 00:15:31.625\nOr, do I wanna do a system push.\n\n304\n00:15:31.625 --> 00:15:32.675\nNot only are they allowed to have it,\n\n305\n00:15:32.675 --> 00:15:34.468\nthey're going to have it whether\nthey want it or not, right?\n\n306\n00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:37.445\n[LAUGH] We're gonna push\nthis application to them.\n\n307\n00:15:37.445 --> 00:15:39.345\nThere are times where we want that,\n\n308\n00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:42.005\nespecially if we want to ensure\nthat the app stays up to date.\n\n309\n00:15:42.005 --> 00:15:43.565\nBecause, if we're doing a system push and\n\n310\n00:15:43.565 --> 00:15:45.545\nan update comes out,\nwe'll system push the update.\n\n311\n00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:50.550\nThey'll get that sooner, so we have that\nability to designate which method we want.\n\n312\n00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.603\nI'm going to go on demand on this one.\n\n313\n00:15:51.603 --> 00:15:54.038\nIf the users want to get it,\nthey can, right?\n\n314\n00:15:54.038 --> 00:15:57.442\nAnd from here,\nI can continue to add more apps And\n\n315\n00:15:57.442 --> 00:16:02.527\nbuild up the list of applications that\nI want those sales people to have.\n\n316\n00:16:02.527 --> 00:16:06.509\nThat's just one app, and we can continue\nto add more until we build up the actual\n\n317\n00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:09.077\nlist of applications that are necessary,\nright?\n\n318\n00:16:09.077 --> 00:16:14.380\nSo that probably takes a while to get all\nthe apps approved that you wanna have.\n\n319\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.067\nOnce that's done though,\nwe can move on to resources.\n\n320\n00:16:17.067 --> 00:16:21.290\nAnd here's where you can define,\nwhat email or more importantly what Wi-Fi.\n\n321\n00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.660\nRemember how I mentioned how we can push a\nwireless certificate to these devices, so\n\n322\n00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.120\nI can designate that right here.\n\n323\n00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.280\nHey, if you want to connect to my Wi-Fi,\nyou're gonna need this cert, and\n\n324\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.660\nit's part of your profile.\n\n325\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.775\nSo if I ever take you out of this profile,\nif I remove this blueprint,\n\n326\n00:16:33.775 --> 00:16:35.087\nyou lose this certificate.\n\n327\n00:16:35.087 --> 00:16:37.060\nNow, you can't connect to my\nwireless network anymore.\n\n328\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.221\nThat's how we can guarantee security\non our wireless network, and\n\n329\n00:16:41.221 --> 00:16:44.190\nthen after that we've got our policies.\n\n330\n00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.851\nNow, the policies vary\ndepending on the device, and\n\n331\n00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:49.583\nyou'll see I've got this little,\nlike a chart here.\n\n332\n00:16:49.583 --> 00:16:53.071\nSee how some of these features\nare supported on Android but not iOS, or\n\n333\n00:16:53.071 --> 00:16:57.167\nsupported on iOS but not Android, and each\none of these is a little bit different.\n\n334\n00:16:57.167 --> 00:17:01.230\nLike allow use of Bluetooth, maybe I don't\nwant people to use Bluetooth, right?\n\n335\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.450\nSo I can come in here and\nI can turn that off, well for Android.\n\n336\n00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.700\nApple doesn't let you do that, so\nI can't turn that off on the iPhones\n\n337\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.690\nversus the camera,\nI can turn off the camera on both.\n\n338\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:14.564\nIf I've got high school students or middle\nschool students that we're issuing iPads\n\n339\n00:17:14.564 --> 00:17:16.999\nto, I might not want them to\nbe able to use the camera.\n\n340\n00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:20.796\nAnd so I can turn that functionality\noff right here through MDM.\n\n341\n00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:23.552\nAlso, if I'm worried about\nsomebody attacking the device and\n\n342\n00:17:23.552 --> 00:17:27.192\nremotely turning on the camera, I can use\nthe MDM to ensure the camera is disabled,\n\n343\n00:17:27.192 --> 00:17:29.030\nso now it can't be turned on.\n\n344\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.460\nSo these types of policies\nare really handy for\n\n345\n00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.040\ncontrolling what that\ndevice is capable of doing.\n\n346\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.325\nAnd as you look through, different\nMDMs will give you different features.\n\n347\n00:17:37.325 --> 00:17:41.490\nBut some of the more important ones you're\ngonna wanna look for, are this one right\n\n348\n00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.962\nhere, Allow SD Card on the Android\ndevice you might want to disable.\n\n349\n00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:48.755\nRemember I talked about in the last\nepisode about how the Android Sandbox gets\n\n350\n00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:51.290\na little bit weaker\nbecause of the SD card.\n\n351\n00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.860\nThere's also password policies,\nwhere you can define whether or\n\n352\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.020\nnot they have to have a lock\ncode on the screen and\n\n353\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.200\nhow many digits the lock code has to be,\nthat kind of information.\n\n354\n00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.590\nThese are all things we can turn on and\noff inside of the device.\n\n355\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.543\nHere's that Require Passcode\nright up at the top.\n\n356\n00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:07.245\nI skipped right over it.\n\n357\n00:18:07.245 --> 00:18:10.740\nAnd if I turn that on we can dictate\nhow strong that code needs to be.\n\n358\n00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.454\nMaybe I want my passcodes\nto be 6 characters or\n\n359\n00:18:13.454 --> 00:18:15.552\n16 characters that would be fun.\n\n360\n00:18:15.552 --> 00:18:16.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Every user would hate you.\n\n361\n00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.179\nBut you specify what you need to achieve\nthe minimum level of security for\n\n362\n00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:22.079\nyour devices.\n\n363\n00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:26.709\nAll right, then in this case, we're gonna\ndesignate what users it applies to.\n\n364\n00:18:26.709 --> 00:18:29.459\nSo I would specify the individual\nusers that were a part of this and\n\n365\n00:18:29.459 --> 00:18:30.970\nthen I would finish up.\n\n366\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.910\nAnd now,\nany user that matched this group would\n\n367\n00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.240\nbasically get this profile\napplied to them, right?\n\n368\n00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.610\nAnd now they would start\nfalling under this role.\n\n369\n00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.910\nSo that's what these\nprofiles allow us to do and\n\n370\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.950\nthat's where we really start controlling\nwhat those devices are capable of.\n\n371\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:50.281\nAnd ensuring that our network stays safe.\n\n372\n00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:54.250\n&gt;&gt; Al right Don, so now that we have\nthe ability to also assign profiles not\n\n373\n00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:59.000\nonly as enrolled, what can we really\ndo with this that makes this effective?\n\n374\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.570\nProfiles sound great, but there's gotta\nbe some action that's also done too.\n\n375\n00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.090\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and monitoring is a part\nof that, so I mentioned that earlier.\n\n376\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.770\nI can watch my phones and\nmake sure they're staying up to date and\n\n377\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.680\nstaying safe.\n\n378\n00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.490\nSo for example, if I go back to my hub,\nI enrolled my iPad earlier,\n\n379\n00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.920\nand I've used the iPad\nin a few other episodes.\n\n380\n00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:20.315\nThe iPad that I've got is jailbroken, and\nso when I go out to my Device list and\n\n381\n00:19:20.315 --> 00:19:24.964\nI pull up my chart here,\nsee how I've got one compromised device?\n\n382\n00:19:24.964 --> 00:19:29.200\nAnd if I go into my list view,\nI can see the iPad right here.\n\n383\n00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.757\nAnd it's showing as\nhaving been compromised.\n\n384\n00:19:31.757 --> 00:19:33.390\nOkay, what does that mean?\n\n385\n00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.760\nWell it's been jailbroken.\n\n386\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.049\nThe security features in place\nby Apple have been removed.\n\n387\n00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:42.177\nAnd as a result,\nit's been automatically unenrolled.\n\n388\n00:19:42.177 --> 00:19:45.000\nIf you look over here to side.\n\n389\n00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.620\nSee how it's become unenrolled?\n\n390\n00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.069\nAll right, so what it did, is it said\nsomebody just jailbroke that phone.\n\n391\n00:19:50.069 --> 00:19:54.320\nSo with or profile, we're gonna\nremove everything the company pushed.\n\n392\n00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.280\nSo if it had our wireless certificate,\nthat just got yanked.\n\n393\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.190\nAnd now it can't get on our\nwireless network, right?\n\n394\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.050\nWe can't remotely manage it anymore.\n\n395\n00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.996\nBut we don't care,\ncuz it's not our anymore, right?\n\n396\n00:20:02.996 --> 00:20:04.670\nIt got jailbroken, it's now out.\n\n397\n00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.537\nSo if we actually corporate own\nthat device, we need to go and\n\n398\n00:20:07.537 --> 00:20:08.840\ntrack it down physically.\n\n399\n00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.844\nBut our data has already\nbeen stripped off,\n\n400\n00:20:10.844 --> 00:20:14.760\nthe moment the security boundaries were\nbroken, it pulled all the data off, right?\n\n401\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.110\nThat's really cool that it happens.\n\n402\n00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.510\nBut we can do it manually too,\nso for example my iPhone,\n\n403\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.350\nthis thing I manage right here,\nthat iPhone showing up right here.\n\n404\n00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.609\nIt's healthy, it's enrolled,\nit's compliant.\n\n405\n00:20:24.609 --> 00:20:25.996\nIt hasn't been compromised.\n\n406\n00:20:25.996 --> 00:20:28.040\nIt's just sitting there\nminding it's own business.\n\n407\n00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.220\nAnd then I go and forget it on the bus.\n\n408\n00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.265\nAll right, well I forgot my phone.\n\n409\n00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:36.323\nWell if the phone is lost,\nwe can take that device, and\n\n410\n00:20:36.323 --> 00:20:38.540\nwe can do stuff to it, right?\n\n411\n00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.630\nWe can lock it, right?\n\n412\n00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:44.742\nIf I want to lock the phone, I can come in\nhere and lock it, and now no one will be\n\n413\n00:20:44.742 --> 00:20:49.959\nable to access the phone until I come in\nhere and unlock it from the MDM, right?\n\n414\n00:20:49.959 --> 00:20:51.883\nSo that's one thing that we can do.\n\n415\n00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:54.647\nYou can also pull\nthe location of the device,\n\n416\n00:20:54.647 --> 00:20:59.610\nwe can do a request device check in and\nthat'll let help to find that device.\n\n417\n00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:03.000\nFind the device will also let me make\na noise, so it can send off some beeps and\n\n418\n00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.650\nmaybe we can locate it that way.\n\n419\n00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:09.148\nBut the odds are if we've lost that phone,\nif somebody physically gets it,\n\n420\n00:21:09.148 --> 00:21:10.483\neven if it's locked,\n\n421\n00:21:10.483 --> 00:21:15.211\nthere might be an exploit they can take\nadvantage of to get the data on the phone.\n\n422\n00:21:15.211 --> 00:21:18.795\nSo what we're normally going to\nwant is to do an Enterprise Wipe.\n\n423\n00:21:18.795 --> 00:21:21.498\nAn Enterprise Wipe is where we\njust come in and we just say,\n\n424\n00:21:21.498 --> 00:21:23.553\nlook, I need to get all\nmy data off of there.\n\n425\n00:21:23.553 --> 00:21:26.303\nNow that's a little different,\nthan a factory reset,\n\n426\n00:21:26.303 --> 00:21:28.480\nwhere we just completely erase the device.\n\n427\n00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.380\nNow, the reason they differentiate here,\nis if it's an employee owned phone.\n\n428\n00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.426\nSo if it's there personal phone and\nthey lose it,\n\n429\n00:21:36.426 --> 00:21:39.250\nwe don't want to erase all of\nthe data that's on it, right?\n\n430\n00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.429\nThey might have data on it that's theirs\nlike photos they took of their kids, and\n\n431\n00:21:42.429 --> 00:21:43.609\nyou don't want to lose that.\n\n432\n00:21:43.609 --> 00:21:47.147\nSo we choose Enterprise Wipe,\nit's wiping your corporate data,\n\n433\n00:21:47.147 --> 00:21:50.053\nthe data that you have that's\na part of that phone, and\n\n434\n00:21:50.053 --> 00:21:52.913\nso what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna take my phone here.\n\n435\n00:21:52.913 --> 00:21:58.340\nI'm just gnna mirror that back up again,\nand once I get that back online.\n\n436\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.091\nI'm gonna send it in Enterprise Wipe\nsignal to just basically erase that\n\n437\n00:22:02.091 --> 00:22:04.510\ncorporate data right off of it, okay?\n\n438\n00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.420\nSo let me punch that in.\n\n439\n00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.200\nThere we go.\n\n440\n00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.930\nSo here's my phone, and\nI'm gonna send the Enterprise Wipe signal.\n\n441\n00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.890\nAnd when I send it,\nI can prevent re-enrollment,\n\n442\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.040\nwhich would stop somebody from\nattaching it back to the MDM again.\n\n443\n00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.540\nIf this is an employee that we've\nterminated, for example, and\n\n444\n00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.200\nthey still have a valid username and\npassword.\n\n445\n00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.060\nWell that's my first mistake, but\nI could prevent it from re-enrolling and\n\n446\n00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.800\nthat would stop them from getting back in.\n\n447\n00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.103\nBut otherwise, we can come in and\n\n448\n00:22:29.103 --> 00:22:32.983\nwe can punch in what the security pin for\nthat device is.\n\n449\n00:22:32.983 --> 00:22:33.633\nThere we go.\n\n450\n00:22:33.633 --> 00:22:37.207\nActually it's the security\nPIN from my administrator.\n\n451\n00:22:37.207 --> 00:22:39.590\nNow it's sending the remote wipe.\n\n452\n00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:44.542\nAnd as I watch on my device, what's gonna\nhappen is the next time the agent connects\n\n453\n00:22:44.542 --> 00:22:49.525\nin, it's gonna generate that signal and\nit's going to initiate the remote wipe.\n\n454\n00:22:49.525 --> 00:22:52.400\nNow notice how it's not\ntaking effect right away.\n\n455\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.580\nThese remote wipes,\nthey do a push notification.\n\n456\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.367\nBut the push notification for Apple\ndevice is actually bounced through Apple.\n\n457\n00:22:59.367 --> 00:23:02.849\nAnd so it can take a moment for\nit to basically bounce through Apple and\n\n458\n00:23:02.849 --> 00:23:04.550\nthen get down to the phone.\n\n459\n00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.430\nBut the next time the phone checks\nin it'll initiate the remote wipe.\n\n460\n00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.890\nNow I'm gonna just launch the app here\nto cause it to happen right away.\n\n461\n00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.780\nAnd see how it's doing the please\nensure all enrollment and\n\n462\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.210\nan enrollment is in progress.\n\n463\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.150\nIt's not actually in progress,\nit's erasing,\n\n464\n00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.169\nit's stripping out that\nemployee data right now.\n\n465\n00:23:22.169 --> 00:23:25.383\nAnd so it's kind of doing that in the\nbackground and just kind of waiting for\n\n466\n00:23:25.383 --> 00:23:26.600\nthat to complete.\n\n467\n00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.420\nBut that process is taking place, and it's\nto securely erase the enterprise data.\n\n468\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.816\nAnd as soon as it's done, my device\nwill be unenrolled, and it will no\n\n469\n00:23:34.816 --> 00:23:38.744\nlonger be a part of the company, but it'll\nalso no longer have the company data.\n\n470\n00:23:38.744 --> 00:23:40.680\nThe certificates gets removed and so on.\n\n471\n00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.960\nAnd in this case that's gonna happen and\n\n472\n00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.670\nwe don't really notice anything\ngoing on on the phone, right?\n\n473\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:49.170\nThe phone is behaving like normal,\nand for a few different reason, right?\n\n474\n00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.804\nThe main reason here is if this\nis employee's been terminated,\n\n475\n00:23:51.804 --> 00:23:54.411\nyou don't want it to look like\nyou're scrubbing their phone.\n\n476\n00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:56.220\nSo it's all being done in the background.\n\n477\n00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.270\nEverything looks normal to them, meanwhile\nthe company data has been removed, right?\n\n478\n00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.790\nIf we had done a lock instead,\nthat's very obvious.\n\n479\n00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.290\nWhen you go and lock the device, you can\ndisplay a message on the screen that says,\n\n480\n00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.565\nif you find this device please call\nthis number, here's a reward, right?\n\n481\n00:24:10.565 --> 00:24:12.870\nWe'll pay you to give it back,\nthat's very obvious.\n\n482\n00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.190\nThat's what we want there.\n\n483\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.130\nBut when it's employee termination or\na lost phone,\n\n484\n00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.890\nyou want it to be fairly transparent.\n\n485\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.070\nAnd that's where\nthe Enterprise Wipe comes in.\n\n486\n00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.584\nSo those are all things that we're\nable to do when we have an MDM.\n\n487\n00:24:23.584 --> 00:24:27.659\nWe have control of these devices,\neven though they're employee owned or\n\n488\n00:24:27.659 --> 00:24:31.180\nnot things that we\nactually bought ourselves.\n\n489\n00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.320\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well thank you for\nhelping clarify what an MDM is for us.\n\n490\n00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.714\nAnd for helping us to be able to see\nthe power behind using an MDM for\n\n491\n00:24:38.714 --> 00:24:42.174\nour networks and of course,\nthese unmanaged mobile devices, and\n\n492\n00:24:42.174 --> 00:24:44.185\nthe control that we have behind them.\n\n493\n00:24:44.185 --> 00:24:47.808\nRemember that what you did see here of\ncourse is the enrollment process as well\n\n494\n00:24:47.808 --> 00:24:48.878\nas choosing that MDM.\n\n495\n00:24:48.878 --> 00:24:52.969\nAnd then lastly, the actions that we can\ntake with it which are very powerful and\n\n496\n00:24:52.969 --> 00:24:55.899\nallow us to make sure that our\ndata is a bit more secure than\n\n497\n00:24:55.899 --> 00:24:58.126\njust having those devices on our network.\n\n498\n00:24:58.126 --> 00:25:02.250\nThank you again Don, for showing us\nthat and thank you also for watching.\n\n499\n00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:06.320\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n500\n00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.187\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

00:00:07.750\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.332\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:13.530\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.730\nYou're watching emerging\ntechnologies security demonstration.\n\n7\n00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.630\nI'll be your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.480\nAnd today, we're going to be learning\nspecifically about man in the middle\n\n9\n00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.660\nattacks with the demonstration here by Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.200\nDon, what are we actually\ngonna take a look at?\n\n11\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.580\nAnd how we gonna demonstrate this?\n\n12\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, well one of the challenges\nwe have with mobile devices like cell\n\n13\n00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.240\nphones and tablets, is that they're\nalmost all wireless, right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.210\nIf you get an iPad, or\n\n15\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.670\nan Android phone, they don't have\nphysical network jacks on them.\n\n16\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.560\nCuz they rely on wireless networks.\n\n17\n00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.330\nAnd unfortunately,\nwireless networks are very easy to spoof.\n\n18\n00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.460\nSo, an attacker can come in and\nspoof wireless network,\n\n19\n00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.363\nmobile devices will jump onto it.\n\n20\n00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:54.910\nAnd now the mobile devices are passing\nthrough a network the attacker controls.\n\n21\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.640\nThat means the attacker can intercept and\neven in some cases modify and\n\n22\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.590\ntamper with the traffic\nas it passes through.\n\n23\n00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.880\nBut that's performing a man\nin the middle attack.\n\n24\n00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.270\nSo that's what we'll be taking\na look right here in this episode.\n\n25\n00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.530\nSo, let me just start off a little diagram\nto make sure everybody's kind of on\n\n26\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.300\nthe same page of where\nwe're going on this.\n\n27\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.050\nHere's a typical network that\nyou'll see in an organization.\n\n28\n00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.100\nWhere you've got a router that's\nproviding Internet access.\n\n29\n00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.860\nYou got a switch which might\nbe built into the router.\n\n30\n00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.000\nIt might be separate.\n\n31\n00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.170\nAnd you've got an access point.\n\n32\n00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.900\nAgain, in a home environment all\nthree of these might be one device.\n\n33\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.740\nIn a corporate or enterprise environment\nthey're going to be separate distinct\n\n34\n00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.320\ndevices, each one\nproviding a different role.\n\n35\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.840\nNow the one I'm concentrating on\nright now is the access point.\n\n36\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.960\nThe access point is creating\na wireless network and\n\n37\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.570\nthe wireless network has an identifier,\nan SSID.\n\n38\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.260\nA service set identifier.\n\n39\n00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.820\nAnd when people connect to the wireless\nnetwork they need to know that name.\n\n40\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.940\nAnd they also need to\nknow how to authenticate.\n\n41\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.493\nIt could be that\nauthentication turned off,\n\n42\n00:01:47.493 --> 00:01:49.853\ncould just be a public wireless network.\n\n43\n00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:55.024\nOr it could be one where you have a SSID\ncoupled with a password, a pre-shared key.\n\n44\n00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:58.870\nAnd then the third method is, we have\nan SSID coupled with a certificate,\n\n45\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.116\njust certificate based authentication.\n\n46\n00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:02.439\nThat's the strongest one.\n\n47\n00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.890\nThat one is very, very difficult to spoof.\n\n48\n00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.185\nBut no password and pre-shared key,\nare the two most common.\n\n49\n00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:12.160\nAnd they're incredibly easy to spoof.\n\n50\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.380\nSo as an example, let's say this\nis a coffee shop like a Starbucks.\n\n51\n00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.529\nThen when you walk into Starbucks, they\nhave right there on the wall the SSID and\n\n52\n00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:20.288\npre-shared key.\n\n53\n00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:22.600\nThe password you use to log into it.\n\n54\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.086\nWell, an attacker could\ntake that information.\n\n55\n00:02:24.086 --> 00:02:27.210\nCuz they know it, it's public.\n\n56\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.670\nAnd then they can bring up their own\naccess point, a rogue access point.\n\n57\n00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.910\nAnd then,\nwhen they bring up a rogue access point,\n\n58\n00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.910\nthey can give it any SSID they want.\n\n59\n00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.640\nIncluding the same SSID that's already in\nuse by the private WiFi for that network.\n\n60\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.350\nAnd when they do that,\ndevices will not know the difference.\n\n61\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.960\nThey'll see it.\n\n62\n00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.640\nIt will be the same SSID, same password,\nthey won't know the difference.\n\n63\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.390\nAnd they'll start switching over and\njumping on to that other network.\n\n64\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.190\nNow, that process happens\ninvisible to the users.\n\n65\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.450\nAnd depending on how the rogue\naccess point is set up.\n\n66\n00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.270\nThat can be completely invisible to\nthem and very difficult to detect.\n\n67\n00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.250\nNow in my diagram here,\n\n68\n00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.142\nI'm showing an access point that's\nphysically wired into a switch.\n\n69\n00:03:11.142 --> 00:03:14.821\nA lot of schools, a lot of corporations,\nthey move equipment around and\n\n70\n00:03:14.821 --> 00:03:17.870\nthey leave wall jacks\nexposed in various places.\n\n71\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.480\nIf you find that, that's like hacker gold.\n\n72\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.970\nBecause they can take an access point,\nplug right into the wall.\n\n73\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.757\nAnd now they can attack the traffic\nas it's passing through to\n\n74\n00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:26.783\nthe regular network.\n\n75\n00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:28.900\nEnd users don't even know what happened.\n\n76\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.035\nBut even without a physical\nconnection you can get access points.\n\n77\n00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:36.600\nThis ones like the Anonabox, that will let\nyou connect to a wireless access point.\n\n78\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.840\nWhile providing your own as two\nsets of antennas inside of it.\n\n79\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.720\nAnd those devices are under $100.\n\n80\n00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.650\nSo it doesn't take a lot of money to\nbuild up an attack profile like this.\n\n81\n00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.880\nThat makes it very easy to exploit and\n\n82\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.070\na very big risk if you're\nmanaging mobile devices.\n\n83\n00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.460\nAll right, well let's see this in action.\n\n84\n00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.347\nWe've got an access point sitting\nhere on the table with us.\n\n85\n00:03:55.347 --> 00:03:57.574\nAnd this little access point is\nkind of an interesting one for\n\n86\n00:03:57.574 --> 00:03:58.542\na few different reasons.\n\n87\n00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:03.130\nOne it's cheap,\nI think it cost again maybe a $100 tops.\n\n88\n00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.030\nBut the other thing is it looks like\na fire detector, like a smoke detector.\n\n89\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.950\nSo it's a very easy to disguise one.\n\n90\n00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.100\nSo you could take this somewhere and\ndrop it off and forget about it.\n\n91\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.650\nThere's companies that\nspecialize in that too.\n\n92\n00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.270\nLike Pony Express, where they specialize\nin making devices that you can plug in.\n\n93\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.510\nAnd they kinda disguise\nthemselves in the environment.\n\n94\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.410\nMeanwhile, they're creating a rogue access\npoint and starting to hijack traffic.\n\n95\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.484\nSo, if I wanna set this access point up\nto hijack traffic the first thing I need\n\n96\n00:04:29.484 --> 00:04:30.916\nto do is I need to get logged in to it.\n\n97\n00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:33.857\nSo, let me connect into that\naccess point real quick.\n\n98\n00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:38.574\nAnd I know that we have a network\nright here in building that\n\n99\n00:04:38.574 --> 00:04:40.660\npeople can connect to.\n\n100\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.810\nThat is a public network that\nis available for people to use.\n\n101\n00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.340\nAnd all I have to do is come in here and\n\n102\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.140\nmodified the wireless\nnetwork in this access point.\n\n103\n00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.280\nAnd I just need to get it to match\nwhat's being used in production.\n\n104\n00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.420\nSo that's not such a challenge.\n\n105\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.040\nSo in my production network,\nI've got an SSID name.\n\n106\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.060\nSo I'm gonna take my SSID here,\nand I'll modify that.\n\n107\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.420\nAnd I'm just gonna put in, ours is just\ncalled ITProTV, or Starbucks, or whatever.\n\n108\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.110\nAnd then I come down here and\nI set my security mode.\n\n109\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.870\nNow if it's a open network with no\npassword on it, I'm actually done,\n\n110\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.380\nthat's enough, right?\n\n111\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.710\nBut if there is a password,\nI need to come in and set it.\n\n112\n00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.210\nI need to try and\nmatch whatever's being used in production.\n\n113\n00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.470\nNow, heres the thing, if there's\nno password, that's easy to spoof.\n\n114\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.140\nIf there's a pre-shared key,\nthat's easy to spoof.\n\n115\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.620\nBut the enterprise modes,\n\n116\n00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.840\nthese guys down here at the bottom,\nthose use certificates.\n\n117\n00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.710\nAnd certificate based\nauthentication can't be spoofed.\n\n118\n00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.080\nThat's the way you mitigate this attack.\n\n119\n00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.430\nThat's the way you defeat it, right?\n\n120\n00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.735\nCertificates, that's where we use\n802.1X authentication and E.A.P,\n\n121\n00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:46.230\nwhich combined is what creates WPA2.\n\n122\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.860\nAnd WPA2 says when you connect you\ngotta present a certificate to me.\n\n123\n00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.500\nAnd I'm gonna run that against\nthe certificate authority and\n\n124\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.220\nverify if it's allowed and\nsee if you can connect in.\n\n125\n00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.270\nIf I'm spoofing this network,\nI don't have access to the CA.\n\n126\n00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.480\nI can't use the certificate for\nvalidation, I can't do any of that.\n\n127\n00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.680\nAnd that means the client is\ngonna know that I'm faking.\n\n128\n00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.040\nThat it's not the real access point.\n\n129\n00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.940\nSo you might ask yourself, why are we\nwatching this episode then if we've got\n\n130\n00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.340\na technique right here\nto completely defeat it?\n\n131\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.690\nThe answer is, certificates are hard.\n\n132\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.250\nThey're difficult.\n\n133\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.160\nThey're complex.\n\n134\n00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.010\nAnd if you think about it, if a visitor\ncomes by your location and they say,\n\n135\n00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.890\nI've got my iPhone.\n\n136\n00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.210\nCan I get on your network?\n\n137\n00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.223\nOkay, well let me call the IT department.\n\n138\n00:06:23.223 --> 00:06:24.438\nI'll get them to issue a certificate.\n\n139\n00:06:24.438 --> 00:06:25.429\nWe'll load it on your phone.\n\n140\n00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:28.450\nIt's a lot, right?\n\n141\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.340\nSo people don't use it, people use\npre-shared keys because they're easy.\n\n142\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.120\nYou brought your own iPhone?\n\n143\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.380\nHere's the password.\n\n144\n00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.700\nAnd you punch it in, right?\n\n145\n00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.593\nBut those passwords can be extracted very,\nvery easily.\n\n146\n00:06:37.593 --> 00:06:40.920\nAnd now, we've opened ourselves\nup to rogue access points.\n\n147\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.000\nSo it's one of those where security and\nconvenience are butting up against each\n\n148\n00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.020\nother, and\nconvenience is winning big time.\n\n149\n00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.979\nIt's rare that you run into people who\nare using certificate bases authentication\n\n150\n00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:50.662\nlike they should.\n\n151\n00:06:50.662 --> 00:06:54.810\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nsay that I'm doing a WPA2-PSK.\n\n152\n00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.070\nAnd then what I need to do is try and\nmatch the encryption.\n\n153\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.390\nThe reality is you can be wrong here and\nmost mobile devices won't care.\n\n154\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.920\nSo it actually gives you\na little bit of flexibility.\n\n155\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.070\nBut, in my case, we're gonna go AES.\n\n156\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.080\nIf you don't know what encryption's\nbeing used by a network,\n\n157\n00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.880\nyou can always use things like\nBIFI analyzer on Android.\n\n158\n00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.100\nIt's really easy to scan and\n\n159\n00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.180\nit'll tell you exactly what\nencryption people are using.\n\n160\n00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.940\nAnd then we specify what our password\nis for that wireless network.\n\n161\n00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.202\nAnd you wanna match\nthe password that's being used.\n\n162\n00:07:20.202 --> 00:07:23.988\nAnd in that way people\nwill just sign right on.\n\n163\n00:07:23.988 --> 00:07:26.058\nBecause what's gonna happen is,\nonce I save this and\n\n164\n00:07:26.058 --> 00:07:27.670\nthe access point starts doing its thing.\n\n165\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:34.020\nWhat it's going to do is, it's now\nadvertising this wireless network.\n\n166\n00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.580\nAnd other people will see it and\ngo to join it, and go to connect.\n\n167\n00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.030\nAnd they don't have a way to validate\nwhether the access point is real or not.\n\n168\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.480\nThey just see that and connect.\n\n169\n00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.060\nAll they care about is that the SSID is\nright and that the password is the same.\n\n170\n00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.970\nAnd they start connecting.\n\n171\n00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.177\nSo my access point here is gonna reboot\nin a second as it takes these changes\n\n172\n00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:52.807\ninto effect.\n\n173\n00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:56.182\nAnd then, as we wait,\nwe'll start seeing devices connect to it.\n\n174\n00:07:56.182 --> 00:07:57.270\nDevices here in the building.\n\n175\n00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.488\nOther people's cellphones and\ntablets, visitors,\n\n176\n00:07:59.488 --> 00:08:01.521\nthey'll start connecting\nto this access point.\n\n177\n00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:04.950\nAnd as soon as that happens, they are now\ngoing to a device that I control.\n\n178\n00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.090\nAnd I can start to intercept their traffic\ncuz they're going through my access point.\n\n179\n00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.400\nThey may not realize it cuz I'm allowing\ntraffic to pass through the access point\n\n180\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.598\nto the regular LAN in the mean time,\nI can intercept it.\n\n181\n00:08:16.598 --> 00:08:19.286\nSo we're gonna use the magic of\nTV here just to give four or\n\n182\n00:08:19.286 --> 00:08:22.208\nfive minutes to give a couple of\nclients a chance to flip over.\n\n183\n00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:24.560\nClients always detect\nthe strongest signal.\n\n184\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.250\nSo, my cell phone is right\nhere by the access point.\n\n185\n00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.707\nIt should detect it and automatically\nflip over without me touching it.\n\n186\n00:08:29.707 --> 00:08:30.980\nBut it usually takes a few minutes.\n\n187\n00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.210\nSo part of hacking is being patient, so we\nneed to wait for a few clients to connect.\n\n188\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.890\nSo let's take a quick pause, and\nthen we'll take a look at our clients.\n\n189\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.732\nAll right, so it's been a couple of\nminutes here in the access points rebooted\n\n190\n00:08:42.732 --> 00:08:45.038\nits comeback up and let's jump in and\nsee what we've got.\n\n191\n00:08:45.038 --> 00:08:48.936\nSo I can see my access point is up, and If\nI jump down here into my wireless client\n\n192\n00:08:48.936 --> 00:08:52.893\nlist I can see, well at least one person\nis connected, and I know the MAC address\n\n193\n00:08:52.893 --> 00:08:56.110\nfor my phone, so I know that\nthat's the one that has connected.\n\n194\n00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.740\nSo I can see that at least one\nperson has already switched over.\n\n195\n00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.780\nNow as people walk by the studio, we\nactually have several access points here.\n\n196\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.022\nSo a lot of them will on\nstronger access points, but\n\n197\n00:09:06.022 --> 00:09:09.674\nas soon as they get in proximity of mine,\nthey should jump over to mine because it's\n\n198\n00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:13.134\nstronger my phone's the first candidate,\nbecause it's just sitting here.\n\n199\n00:09:13.134 --> 00:09:18.290\nNow, once they're connected, their traffic\nis now going through the access point.\n\n200\n00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.720\nBut they don't necessarily know that.\n\n201\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.270\nIf I take a look at my phone,\nhere's my phone.\n\n202\n00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:27.209\nAnd if it fires up a web browser, an goes\nto CNN or somewhere like that, it's able\n\n203\n00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:32.019\nto browse just like normal, because\nI'm passing the traffic through right?\n\n204\n00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:35.887\nBut the key piece here is that they're\npassing through infrastructure that I\n\n205\n00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:36.740\ncontrol.\n\n206\n00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.840\nSo now I can mess with the session.\n\n207\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n208\n00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.625\nWell, that actually lets us to\nbe able to capture traffic but\n\n209\n00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:45.170\nwhat do I do with the traffic\nnow that I have it?\n\n210\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.880\n&gt;&gt; All right so, the traffic's\npassing through my infrastructure,\n\n211\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.710\nso I can now start to manipulate that and\ndepending on the device that I'm using\n\n212\n00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.310\nthere's a few different\nways we can go about it.\n\n213\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.240\nLet me go back to my diagram from earlier.\n\n214\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.985\nWhat I've just built is\nthis right here right?\n\n215\n00:09:56.985 --> 00:10:01.077\nWhere I've got a rogue access point\nthat's now getting devices to connect and\n\n216\n00:10:01.077 --> 00:10:02.876\npassing through to the internet.\n\n217\n00:10:02.876 --> 00:10:06.480\nOn that device I might have the ability\nto do what's called port mirroring.\n\n218\n00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.190\nPort mirroring is where we take\nall the traffic from one port and\n\n219\n00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.560\nwe copy it somewhere else.\n\n220\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.590\nNow with port mirroring where you\ncopy to might be internal storage\n\n221\n00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.530\nlike the little pony\nexpress boxes I mentioned.\n\n222\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.390\nThey plug into a wall and they just\nrecord it right to internal storage.\n\n223\n00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.253\nAnd then you can come back weeks later,\ngrab the device and\n\n224\n00:10:22.253 --> 00:10:24.660\nsift through all the data\nat your leisure right?\n\n225\n00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.611\nOr if you wanna be a little more active,\n\n226\n00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:30.339\nif you're actually trying to attack\ndevices you need it to be in real time,\n\n227\n00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:34.090\nand for that you're going to wanna\nmirror the traffic to usually a laptop.\n\n228\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:38.460\nSomething that you can run a protocol\nanalyzer, or a sniffer on With a sniffer,\n\n229\n00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.460\nwe can see the actual traffic in motion\nand even work with it in some scenarios,\n\n230\n00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.870\nwill see in the next episode, but for\n\n231\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.280\nright now I wanna just take\na look at this traffic.\n\n232\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.410\nNow I've got a little switch in place here\nwhich is a Cisco switch that is gonna let\n\n233\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.310\nme do that port mirroring.\n\n234\n00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.845\nAnd so what I can do is I\ncan jump into that device,\n\n235\n00:10:56.845 --> 00:10:59.443\nwhich I don't have pulled up here.\n\n236\n00:10:59.443 --> 00:11:03.860\nAnd once I get connected into it,\nI can set up a port mirror.\n\n237\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.150\nAnd it's different depending on which\nvendor you use, how you configure it.\n\n238\n00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.098\nBut the process is really not that hard,\nespecially, on a Cisco switch like this.\n\n239\n00:11:12.098 --> 00:11:17.170\nSo what I've got is the wireless\naccess point is plugged into port one\n\n240\n00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:22.343\non this switch and my laptop is plugged\ninto port three on this switch.\n\n241\n00:11:22.343 --> 00:11:26.900\nAnd so I'm gonna run a command here,\nwhich is monitor session.\n\n242\n00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.334\nWhich is what turns on CISCO's switch port\nanalyzer, or span, it's port mirroring.\n\n243\n00:11:31.334 --> 00:11:32.980\nAnd you can mirror\nseveral different ports.\n\n244\n00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.840\nSo this is just the first pair\nof ports that I'm gonna mirror.\n\n245\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.150\nAnd I need to specify a source interface,\nand\n\n246\n00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.700\nmy source interface is gonna be\nthe fast ethernet 0/1 interface.\n\n247\n00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.260\nI'm gonna say get the data from that\nport and send it somewhere else.\n\n248\n00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.403\nNow, if I stop here It's only\ngonna get half the communication.\n\n249\n00:11:51.403 --> 00:11:54.610\nYou'll see where I can turn on receive,\ntransmit, or both.\n\n250\n00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.980\nIt doesn't do both by default.\n\n251\n00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.091\nSo I'm gonna tell it to do both.\n\n252\n00:11:57.091 --> 00:12:00.270\nI'm gonna get everything going into and\nout of this interface.\n\n253\n00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:05.080\nI wanna see a client send a message and\nI wanna see the server's response, right?\n\n254\n00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.120\nI want both sides of a communication.\n\n255\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.010\nSo I'm gonna enable that.\n\n256\n00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.820\nAnd then I need to tell it\nwhere I'm gonna send it to.\n\n257\n00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:16.190\nSo I'm gonna say monitor session 1,\nright, they're the same session.\n\n258\n00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.656\nBut instead of saying source interface,\n\n259\n00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:23.822\nI'm gonna say destination interface fa0/3.\n\n260\n00:12:23.822 --> 00:12:26.523\nI'm gonna send it to my laptop.\n\n261\n00:12:26.523 --> 00:12:29.530\nNow, on my laptop,\nI'm watching for that traffic.\n\n262\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.104\nOr I will be here, in a moment.\n\n263\n00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:34.520\nI don't want my laptop to be intercepted.\n\n264\n00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.932\nI don't want the clients, these end users,\nto know that my laptop is watching them.\n\n265\n00:12:38.932 --> 00:12:43.642\nWhen you press Enter on this command\nCisco will automatically make your port\n\n266\n00:12:43.642 --> 00:12:45.360\nbasically listen only.\n\n267\n00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.270\nI'll listen, I'll hear traffic.\n\n268\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.490\nBut I won't be able to reply,\nI won't be able to send data.\n\n269\n00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.119\nWhich is perfect for attack purposes.\n\n270\n00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:52.860\nI don't want to be seen.\n\n271\n00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.300\nThere's an extra command we\ncan add on here, ingress.\n\n272\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.710\nAnd if we do that,\nit'll allow traffic to come in port 3,\n\n273\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.550\nwhich will be my laptop talking.\n\n274\n00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.370\nBut I don't want that.\n\n275\n00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.300\nSo by default this is already benefiting\nme from an attack perspective.\n\n276\n00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.976\nI can no longer talk on the port so\nactually I have just locked myself out,\n\n277\n00:13:07.976 --> 00:13:10.407\nin fact I just moved to\nanother port no big deal.\n\n278\n00:13:10.407 --> 00:13:15.725\nBut now no one else can see me but I'm\ngetting a copy of all the traffic going to\n\n279\n00:13:15.725 --> 00:13:21.379\nthat port, and that's where the protocol\nsniffer comes in I can switch over to,\n\n280\n00:13:21.379 --> 00:13:23.980\nI'll use Wireshark, in this case.\n\n281\n00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.330\nIf you haven't heard of Wireshark, it's\nan open source, completely free program.\n\n282\n00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.320\nYou can go and\ndownload it at wireshark.org,\n\n283\n00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.020\nand it is a great protocol and\nPacket Sniffer.\n\n284\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.458\nIt can analyze and show us a lot of data.\n\n285\n00:13:35.458 --> 00:13:38.365\nAnd it's picking up all of my various\nnetwork adapters in this system.\n\n286\n00:13:38.365 --> 00:13:41.174\nAnd so, I'm just gonna pick\nmy ethernet adapter, and\n\n287\n00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:47.010\nit's gonna start showing you all\nthe traffic that's going over that line.\n\n288\n00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.790\nNow the more clients you have, the more\ntraffic you're gonna see, so this could\n\n289\n00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:55.650\nactually pick up quite a bit and start\nrattling by really, really fast, right?\n\n290\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.260\nAnd if I scroll down you'll see it's\nactually, just in the brief time I've\n\n291\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.980\nlaunched it, it's already captured\n1,600 packets of data, right?\n\n292\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.810\nLots of information.\n\n293\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:09.510\nEverything going in and out of that\naccess point is reflected right here.\n\n294\n00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.734\nSo if I were to take my mobile phone and\nstart to communicate,\n\n295\n00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:14.896\nit's all getting recorded right here.\n\n296\n00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:17.831\nNow how do I find who I can target here.\n\n297\n00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:20.770\nInside of your protocol analyzer it\ncan get a little overwhelming right?\n\n298\n00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.590\nThe amount of data that's rattling by.\n\n299\n00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.564\nSo up top we've got these analyze Options,\nwhere I can start to kind of,\n\n300\n00:14:26.564 --> 00:14:30.700\ntranslate the information into\nsomething that's human readable.\n\n301\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.460\nAnd so I'm gonna use that Follow\nfeature here and just a moment\n\n302\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.420\nwe can follow one particular communication\nto find out if we should add it.\n\n303\n00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.570\nBut before I can follow, I need to\nfigure out who I want to follow and so\n\n304\n00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:45.360\nI'm going to go under statistics and\nunder Statistics we can go to Endpoints.\n\n305\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.648\nAnd under Endpoints, we'll see a list\nof everybody who's been detected.\n\n306\n00:14:49.648 --> 00:14:53.610\nNow it's showing it by MAC address here,\nbut I really wanna know by IP.\n\n307\n00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:58.280\nSo I'm gonna switch over to IPv4,\nAnd I'm gonna sort by packets.\n\n308\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.581\nSo I wanna see who's\nsending the most data.\n\n309\n00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:03.077\nAnd now I can start to see communications.\n\n310\n00:15:03.077 --> 00:15:04.350\nThat first one is a multicast.\n\n311\n00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.473\nI'm gonna ignore that, right?\n\n312\n00:15:05.473 --> 00:15:07.024\nThat can be any number of clients.\n\n313\n00:15:07.024 --> 00:15:12.192\nBut then I've got 10.0.10.133,\nor 10.0.11.207, and so on.\n\n314\n00:15:12.192 --> 00:15:15.650\nEach of these are devices on the network.\n\n315\n00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.191\nNow they're communicating and\nthey're communicating not a ton.\n\n316\n00:15:20.191 --> 00:15:24.191\nI mean it looks like a ton, but it really\nisn't if you look this one's moved 74k of\n\n317\n00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:27.250\ndata in one direction 866k\nin the other direction.\n\n318\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.130\nActually its 78k in both directions.\n\n319\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.550\nSo really not a whole heck of a lot\nof information moving across these.\n\n320\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.660\nBut when I start doing something\nlike taking my mobile phone.\n\n321\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.300\nAnd browsing the network or\ndoing whatever, right.\n\n322\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.560\nSo if I start clicking on some articles\nand generating some more activity here.\n\n323\n00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.210\nWe're gonna see that\ntraffic start to bump up.\n\n324\n00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.730\nEspecially as it loads images and\nother things.\n\n325\n00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.810\nAnd we're gonna see that\nmobile device climb up.\n\n326\n00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.840\nSo we normally just target\nwhoever's communicating the most.\n\n327\n00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.050\nCuz that's easy pickings, right?\n\n328\n00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.964\nBut to save us a little time,\nI'm gonna target my phone specifically.\n\n329\n00:15:59.964 --> 00:16:04.983\nAnd my phone is 10.0.10.196,\nthat one right there, all right.\n\n330\n00:16:04.983 --> 00:16:06.979\nThe reality is that you could\ntarget anybody in the access point,\n\n331\n00:16:06.979 --> 00:16:07.787\nthat's the whole point.\n\n332\n00:16:07.787 --> 00:16:10.446\nBut we'll target the phone because\nI can I can see it a little better.\n\n333\n00:16:10.446 --> 00:16:14.657\nSo, once we know who we're gonna target,\nwe can go back into our protocol analyzer.\n\n334\n00:16:14.657 --> 00:16:16.696\nAnd you have what are called filters,\n\n335\n00:16:16.696 --> 00:16:20.140\nwhere you can filter who it\nis you're wanting to watch.\n\n336\n00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.030\nAnd so, I'm going to put a filter in here.\n\n337\n00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:28.501\nSo I will say ip.addr ==10.0.10.196.\n\n338\n00:16:28.501 --> 00:16:32.033\nI'm putting in the IP\naddress of the phone, and\n\n339\n00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:36.790\nnow I'm only going to see traffic to and\nfrom the phone.\n\n340\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:41.250\nSo, now I'm just watching this one device,\nand I can see everything.\n\n341\n00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.340\nNow, what is everything, right?\n\n342\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.150\nWhat do I mean when I say\nwe can see everything?\n\n343\n00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.700\nWell, I see all these packets.\n\n344\n00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.190\nAnd if the packets are encrypted,\n\n345\n00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.180\nI'm not gonna get a whole lot of\ninformation out of there, right?\n\n346\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.170\nSo, see these packets here\nwere it says TLSv1.2.\n\n347\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.770\nThat means that I went to\na website that was using SSL.\n\n348\n00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.720\nA lot of websites use SSL these days.\n\n349\n00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.270\nThis is going to hide the content.\n\n350\n00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.650\nBut it doesn't hide where I went to.\n\n351\n00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:09.260\nI can still look up the IP address and I\ncan say, right, who is 216.58.192.78, and\n\n352\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.420\nI can figure out what that site is.\n\n353\n00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.410\nSo, I know where they went,\nI just don't what they got, right?\n\n354\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.950\nEncryption is not perfect in this sense.\n\n355\n00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:20.080\nBut, a lot of traffic is not encrypted,\na lot of websites.\n\n356\n00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.856\nThe first website I went to is CNN.\n\n357\n00:17:21.856 --> 00:17:24.340\nCNN does not use SSL by default.\n\n358\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.740\nA lot of other websites do these days,\nbut CNN doesn't.\n\n359\n00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:32.760\nSo, I would be able to find that in\nhere and read exactly what was rendered,\n\n360\n00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.870\nwhat was shown to that client, and\nbe able to determine what that was, right?\n\n361\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.370\nTo give you a better example, though,\n\n362\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:43.150\nlet me bring up some traffic that we\ncan a little more easily recreate.\n\n363\n00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.560\nSo I'm gonna bring up my phone again.\n\n364\n00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.530\nAnd on my phone,\nI've got a little Telnet client.\n\n365\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.940\nAnd Telnet sends data unencrypted, right?\n\n366\n00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.080\nWhen you communicate via Telnet,\nit's not an encrypted protocol,\n\n367\n00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.340\nwhich makes it dangerous.\n\n368\n00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.770\nMost people don't think of it as\ndangerous, cuz it works, but it is.\n\n369\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.640\nSo if I were to reach out to a site,\nlike this one, and\n\n370\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.080\non the site, it ask me to authenticate.\n\n371\n00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.291\nIt's asking me to type in a name, right?\n\n372\n00:18:09.291 --> 00:18:11.263\nSo, this is a little online video game,\nand so\n\n373\n00:18:11.263 --> 00:18:13.480\nyou can type in your name right here.\n\n374\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.807\nAnd when I go to authenticate,\nI've gotta provide the user name.\n\n375\n00:18:16.807 --> 00:18:20.480\nSo, I'll just type in\na name like D-P-E-Z-E-T.\n\n376\n00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.100\nI was gonna type it on the phone,\nit's a little bit easier.\n\n377\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.100\nAnd then it's gonna prompt for\na password and so on, right?\n\n378\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.110\nSo it's asking for that information.\n\n379\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.780\nWell as I type that,\nTelnet is sending it across the line.\n\n380\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.060\nAnd it's sending it unencrypted.\n\n381\n00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.030\nNow, my packet capture here\nshould be grabbing it also.\n\n382\n00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:43.790\nAnd if I hunt for that traffic, I can find\nit and start to interpret what it is.\n\n383\n00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.140\nOkay, so, I'll take some of these\nunencrypted data down here.\n\n384\n00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.620\nAnd I'm just gonna right-click on\nanyone of these unencrypted packets.\n\n385\n00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.150\nAnd remember that follow\noption I mentioned,\n\n386\n00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.120\nI'm gonna go to follow TCP Stream.\n\n387\n00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.800\nAnd what it's going to do is it's\ngonna take all that information and\n\n388\n00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.240\nreconstruct it.\n\n389\n00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.290\nAnd right here,\nI can see the login to that video game.\n\n390\n00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.100\nAnd I can see your name and\n\n391\n00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.760\nthere's the username I typed in,\nDPEZET, and had I pressed Enter and\n\n392\n00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.080\ndone a password, my password would\nbe right there in plain text.\n\n393\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.140\nSo, as far as\nan eavesdropping attack goes,\n\n394\n00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.860\nthis is perfect, I can eavesdrop,\ncollect this traffic.\n\n395\n00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.323\nEven the encrypted traffic is worth\ncapturing because hey, I may not be able\n\n396\n00:19:25.323 --> 00:19:28.966\nto break it today, but let me take it home\nand I'll put a couple of computers on.\n\n397\n00:19:28.966 --> 00:19:31.680\nI'll throw it on the Cloud,\nget some computer resources going on it.\n\n398\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.750\nAnd maybe in a few months,\nI can break that traffic and get into and\n\n399\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.250\nthen figure out what it was.\n\n400\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.970\nIt might be obsolete by that point,\nthe data, but might be still be useful.\n\n401\n00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.373\nWhen we collect data like this, that's\na problem, like we need to make sure that\n\n402\n00:19:43.373 --> 00:19:45.893\npeople aren't able to collect\nthe data in the first place.\n\n403\n00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.888\nBut here, I'm able to intercept it.\n\n404\n00:19:47.888 --> 00:19:53.090\nI can see what's going on and now,\nI've lost my privacy on that line, right?\n\n405\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.590\nAnd more importantly, somebody can\nstart tampering with the data, and\n\n406\n00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.910\nI wouldn't necessarily know about it.\n\n407\n00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:58.839\nThat's the real challenge here.\n\n408\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.510\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n409\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.400\nNow that we actually can see\nwhere we're getting the traffic,\n\n410\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.180\nwe're able to do a little bit of\nan interpreting of the data as well,\n\n411\n00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.500\nhow do we really protect ourselves?\n\n412\n00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.100\nMost of us may not be able to\nget access to that switch and\n\n413\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.140\nbe able to do some of those things.\n\n414\n00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.910\nBut how do we do it on our phone then?\n\n415\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know, the best thing\nto do is use encryption, right?\n\n416\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.200\nAnd I showed you guys that\nTLS traffic from a webpage.\n\n417\n00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.100\nIf I'd taken some of that TLS traffic and\ndid follow TCP stream,\n\n418\n00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.080\nI would just see a big\njumbled bunch of mess, right?\n\n419\n00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.720\nBut remember what I said\nwas the weakness there.\n\n420\n00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.707\nI can still tell where somebody went.\n\n421\n00:20:31.707 --> 00:20:33.060\nAnd I don't know what\ninformation they got.\n\n422\n00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.610\nLike, I might know they went to\nAmazon.com to go shopping, but\n\n423\n00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.240\nI didn't get their\ncredit card information.\n\n424\n00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.190\nI didn't see what they bought.\n\n425\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.977\nBut I know they went to Amazon.com, right?\n\n426\n00:20:40.977 --> 00:20:42.840\nNow, why is that a problem?\n\n427\n00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.670\nMaybe that is enough.\n\n428\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.880\nMaybe we look at every website\nthat I go to I always use SSL.\n\n429\n00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.680\nOkay.\n\n430\n00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:53.350\nWell, If I know where you're going,\nthere is a text that we can do and\n\n431\n00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.540\nI will show you one in the next episode.\n\n432\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.250\nWe can do DNS spoofing, and\n\n433\n00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.030\nif I know the sites you go to I can\nredirect DNS to a server that I control\n\n434\n00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.150\nand now I can get around that with the\nencryption doesn't start at all, right?\n\n435\n00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.677\nSo, that's kind of challenge,\nwe may wanna mask that.\n\n436\n00:21:06.677 --> 00:21:10.579\nThere is also a scenario, where maybe I\nhave to use a protocol that's not secured,\n\n437\n00:21:10.579 --> 00:21:12.870\nmaybe you got a network printer.\n\n438\n00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.260\nAnd the management interface of that\nnetwork printer doesn't support SSL.\n\n439\n00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.203\nIt only uses HTTP, right?\n\n440\n00:21:18.203 --> 00:21:21.970\nAnd I know what some of you are thinking,\nis come on, no printer is like that.\n\n441\n00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.470\nWell, we're actually starting to\nsee that more and more these days\n\n442\n00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:29.170\nbecause web browsers are dropping\nsupport for older versions of HTTPS.\n\n443\n00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.090\nAnd, a lot of printers and\n\n444\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:35.840\ndevices have firmware that don't support\nthe newer versions of HTTPS, the TLSv1.2.\n\n445\n00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.710\nAnd so, what ends up happening is\nyou have to turn it off and use and\n\n446\n00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.040\nunencrypted connection.\n\n447\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.990\nBy the browsers tightening their security,\n\n448\n00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.260\nit's made us have to weaken\nsecurity in other places.\n\n449\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.490\nThat's a real problem.\n\n450\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.340\nBut, it's a reality.\n\n451\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.590\nSo, how do we protect that?\n\n452\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.000\nIf I have to use a protocol\nthat doesn't support security?\n\n453\n00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.900\nOr what if I just want\nto go the extra step and\n\n454\n00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.960\nmake sure people can't even\ntell where I went, right?\n\n455\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.100\nThere, the solution is to use a VPN.\n\n456\n00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:00.860\nWhen you use a VPN,\n\n457\n00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.360\na virtual private network, all of your\ntraffic is thrown inside of a tunnel.\n\n458\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.060\nAnd now, it becomes much more difficult\nto see and track and intercept.\n\n459\n00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.820\nSo, let me show you an example of that,\nI'm gonna switch back over to my phone.\n\n460\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.180\nAnd we'll disconnect from\nthis Telnet session here.\n\n461\n00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.880\nOkay and, on my phone,\nI'm gonna fire up a VPN connection, so\n\n462\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.850\nI'm using a service here called proXPN,\nand\n\n463\n00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.500\nwhat they do is they provide VPN\nconnections all over the world.\n\n464\n00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.020\nAnd so you can pick a target location,\nI'm gonna connect to New York.\n\n465\n00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.030\nAnd so we'll get connected.\n\n466\n00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.520\nNow, what's gonna happen here is my phone\n\n467\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.470\nis gonna build a VPN tunnel up to\ntheir servers in New York, and\n\n468\n00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:46.680\nthen all of my traffic on the phone\nis now being sent via that tunnel.\n\n469\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.281\n&gt;&gt; And now Don, with that VPN tunnel up,\n\n470\n00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:52.290\nwhat are we gonna be able to see inside\nof that sniffer, anything at all?\n\n471\n00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean we will.\n\n472\n00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:57.530\nYou'll just see like a lot\nof it as encrypted traffic.\n\n473\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:58.880\nSo it's not as useful.\n\n474\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.560\nLet me, I'm gonna reset my sniffer here,\nand I will show you.\n\n475\n00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.540\nI'm gonna reset the sniffer so\nI get a good clean start, right?\n\n476\n00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.870\nBecause we have a lot of unencrypted\nstuff, and now that tunnel is up.\n\n477\n00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.950\nSo I wanna pretend like I'm\njust starting right now.\n\n478\n00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:10.780\nSo I'm gonna come in here.\n\n479\n00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.640\nOops.\nActually,\n\n480\n00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.392\nI need to clear my little filter first.\n\n481\n00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:14.605\nWe will clear out that filter.\n\n482\n00:23:14.605 --> 00:23:18.370\nI am gonna go ahead and put the filter\nback in of just my cell phone.\n\n483\n00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.390\nI just want to see\nthe cell phone's traffic.\n\n484\n00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:26.050\nAnd I'm gonna come in here and\nmake sure that applies.\n\n485\n00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.112\nThere you go, all right.\n\n486\n00:23:27.112 --> 00:23:29.250\nSo, I'm just seeing what\nis on the cell phone.\n\n487\n00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.850\nAnd in the meantime,\nI'm gonna go back to my cell phone.\n\n488\n00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:37.240\nAnd you know, we'll like reconnect to that\nlittle video games, there's that traffic,\n\n489\n00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.750\nand now I'm sending this unencrypted\ntraffic across the line, right?\n\n490\n00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.950\nIn the meantime, look at what's\ngoing on here in sniffer land.\n\n491\n00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.710\nIt doesn't see Telnet traffic, right?\n\n492\n00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.710\nIt sees QUIC traffic.\n\n493\n00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.390\nQUIC is the encryption protocol\nthat's being used for the VPN tunnel.\n\n494\n00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.540\nIf I were to browse to CNN or\nsomebody else like that.\n\n495\n00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.120\nRight, so let me switch back\nover to the cellphone again.\n\n496\n00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.460\nAnd we'll fire up our web browser and\nwe go back to CNN.\n\n497\n00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.200\nSo, this is just web traffic.\n\n498\n00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.260\nRight, I should see HTTP or\nmaybe TLSv1.2 if we're doing SSL.\n\n499\n00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.780\nBut when I look back here,\nit's just QUIC traffic.\n\n500\n00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.500\nAnd if I take that traffic,\nit's TCP at the end of the day.\n\n501\n00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.990\nActually, I think it might be UDP.\n\n502\n00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:26.340\nThe protocol supports both, I think it\ndefaults to UDP if I remember correctly.\n\n503\n00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.060\nBut if I stop here for a second and\nI right click on that and I go to follow,\n\n504\n00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.757\nI can follow the UDP stream, it was UDP.\n\n505\n00:24:33.757 --> 00:24:36.020\nAnd when I follow it, what do I see?\n\n506\n00:24:37.118 --> 00:24:40.069\nJust a jumbled mess, it's encrypted data.\n\n507\n00:24:40.069 --> 00:24:43.155\nNow, that means that I have effectively\ndefeated the man in the middle\n\n508\n00:24:43.155 --> 00:24:43.949\nattack, right?\n\n509\n00:24:43.949 --> 00:24:46.450\nIf somebody intercept this,\nthis is jumbled mess and\n\n510\n00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.241\nthey can't tell where I went,\nwhat protocols I was using.\n\n511\n00:24:49.241 --> 00:24:52.160\nIt's all inside the VPN tunnel,\nit's all protected.\n\n512\n00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.890\nAt the same time,\nthey can still record the data though.\n\n513\n00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.080\nAnd they can take that recorded data and\nthen work on it and take their time and\n\n514\n00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.230\ntry and break it and\nfind out what this information was.\n\n515\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.020\nAnd who knows, maybe they can\nachieve that in a period of time.\n\n516\n00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.160\nThat is kind of the other\nside of this weakness.\n\n517\n00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.190\nBut to truly protect ourselves,\n\n518\n00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:12.160\nwe need to be making sure that\nwe use secure protocols and\n\n519\n00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.220\nthat we have a way of validating that\naccess points are who they say they are.\n\n520\n00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.240\nAnd certificate based authentication\nis the best way to do that.\n\n521\n00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.150\nSo WPA2 Enterprise using EAP,\n\n522\n00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.040\nthe Extensible Authentication Protocol,\nto do certificate validation.\n\n523\n00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.350\nIt's hard, it's more complex.\n\n524\n00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.310\nBut that's the way to guarantee access\npoints are who they say they are.\n\n525\n00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.410\nAnd then VPN tunnels are a way\nyou can protect yourselves on\n\n526\n00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.990\nPublic Wireless Networks that\nyou have no way to validate.\n\n527\n00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.490\nLike if I'm at a convention or\n\n528\n00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:44.050\na hotel or whatever, I always use\nVPN tunnel because I trust my stuff.\n\n529\n00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.276\nI don't trust the hotel's.\n\n530\n00:25:45.276 --> 00:25:48.710\nSo, you don't know who can figure that\nnetwork or who's intercepting devices,\n\n531\n00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.220\nthat's why we need these\ntypes of technologies.\n\n532\n00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:51.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n533\n00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:56.359\nWell, thank you again for showing us all\nthe information here about setting up\n\n534\n00:25:56.359 --> 00:26:00.795\nthe idea of a man in the middle attack and\nshowing of course how to mitigate it.\n\n535\n00:26:00.795 --> 00:26:05.880\nAnd then of course being able to see the\ninformation in it too is all very helpful.\n\n536\n00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.701\nThat is a great place also for us to\nsign off for this particular segment.\n\n537\n00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:13.650\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n538\n00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:14.830\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

--> 00:00:11.969\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.580\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.681\nYou're watching emerging technology\nsecurity demonstrations.\n\n6\n00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:18.739\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:23.330\nAnd today, we're gonna take a look at\nperforming an impersonation attack.\n\n8\n00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.630\nAnd here to help us is\ngonna be Mr Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.120\nDon, welcome and\nwhat are we taking a look at today?\n\n10\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.164\n&gt;&gt; All right, well if you've been\nwatching all of our demonstrations,\n\n11\n00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:34.168\nin the last one we got a chance to see\nhow to set up a rogue access point.\n\n12\n00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:37.828\nAnd once we had a road access point\nup,clients would connect to us and\n\n13\n00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:40.300\nwe could now perform eavesdropping, right?\n\n14\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.951\nWe were doing man in the middle of attack,\nbut\n\n15\n00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:44.653\nwe weren't really attacking the clients,\nwe were just eavesdropping.\n\n16\n00:00:44.653 --> 00:00:47.690\nWe're monitoring,\nwe're listening in on that data.\n\n17\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.973\nAnd so, in this episode what we wanna do\nis we wanna take that a step further and\n\n18\n00:00:50.973 --> 00:00:54.731\nsay, instead of just listening, let's see\nif we can't manipulate the user, right?\n\n19\n00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:59.261\nLet's see if we can't manipulate them by\nimpersonating another site or making them\n\n20\n00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:04.020\nbelieve they're going one location when\nthey're actually going somewhere else.\n\n21\n00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.319\nAnd by doing that, we can start to capture\nsensitive information, use names and\n\n22\n00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:08.677\npasswords, credit card data and\n\n23\n00:01:08.677 --> 00:01:12.044\nall of the other things that are available\nout there through this type of attacks.\n\n24\n00:01:12.044 --> 00:01:13.869\nSo that's what we're gonna take\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n25\n00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.617\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Don how do we take\nadvantage of now that we've got that set\n\n26\n00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:21.960\nup as far as a man in mill tech, how do\nwe take advantage of the information?\n\n27\n00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, well in the last episode\nthe way we set everything up was for\n\n28\n00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.870\neavesdropping.\n\n29\n00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.520\nAnd with eavesdropping,\nyour goal is to be invisible,\n\n30\n00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.830\nthat you want to be transparent,\nyou wanna be hidden.\n\n31\n00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.960\nAnd so when we set up things like the port\nmirroring that was configured there,\n\n32\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.830\nI made sure that the port that my\ndevice was on, my sniffer was on.\n\n33\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.200\nWas configured to only be able to\nreceive data and that's it, but\n\n34\n00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.360\nit wouldn't be able to talk so\nI was invisible.\n\n35\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.850\nBut if we're gonna try and manipulate\nusers, we have to become visible.\n\n36\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.280\nWe have to start\nparticipating in the network.\n\n37\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.900\nAnd so our attack is gonna get\na little bit more complex but\n\n38\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.850\nour results will be a lot more beneficial,\nright.\n\n39\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.000\nSo how do we make it more complex?\n\n40\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.671\nWell let me go back to this diagram here,\n\n41\n00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:03.581\nthis is the diagram of the attack\nthat we pulled off from last episode.\n\n42\n00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:07.361\nWe brought up a rogue access point and\nthen via that access point we're able to\n\n43\n00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:11.190\nuse port mirroring to capture over\nthis data to a sniffer and read it.\n\n44\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.210\nBut the access point for\nthe most part was invisible to the users.\n\n45\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.357\nThe user's traffic was passing through\nthe access point into the switch and\n\n46\n00:02:17.357 --> 00:02:20.740\nmoving on to the local area\nnetwork just like normal, right?\n\n47\n00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.402\nSo they didn't even know we were there.\n\n48\n00:02:22.402 --> 00:02:27.960\nBut we can go a little bit further, we can\nstart to add additional infrastructure.\n\n49\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.810\nAnd the number one piece of infrastructure\nthat usually gets targeted is DNS.\n\n50\n00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.295\nDNS is the domain naming service and\nerror system.\n\n51\n00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:37.610\nAnd what it allows us to do is\nresolve a name to an IP address.\n\n52\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.584\nWhen we browse the internet every\nserver you go to has an IP address.\n\n53\n00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:43.955\nAnd we might call it www.google.com but\nat the end of the day,\n\n54\n00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.770\nit gets resolved to an IP.\n\n55\n00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.444\nAnd that IP sends you to Google servers.\n\n56\n00:02:48.444 --> 00:02:51.340\nWell, what if we intercepted that process?\n\n57\n00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.080\nWhat if we intercepted those DNS lookups,\nand\n\n58\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.300\ninstead of giving Google's IPs,\nwe gave one of our IPs?\n\n59\n00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.070\nMore importantly, the IP of a server\npretending to be Google, or\n\n60\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.250\npretending to be Facebook, or\nwhoever it is that you're targeting.\n\n61\n00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.170\nWe can do that by setting\nup a rogue DNS server or\n\n62\n00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.660\npoisoning an existing DNS server.\n\n63\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.380\nNow poisoning an existing DNS server is\npretty challenging if we're taking control\n\n64\n00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.460\nof this access point already we can\ntypically leverage it and bring up our\n\n65\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.380\nown DNS server now we don't have to poison\nanything it's a DNS server we control.\n\n66\n00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.652\nAnd we can redirect domains to whatever\nIPs we want which means we can send people\n\n67\n00:03:26.652 --> 00:03:30.543\nto hijack sites or pages that have\nmalicious software, drive by install\n\n68\n00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.948\nthe bad things that we want and\nwe can do this cuz we control DNS.\n\n69\n00:03:33.948 --> 00:03:34.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n70\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.765\nDon how in the world are we gonna\nget somebody to use my DNS servers.\n\n71\n00:03:39.765 --> 00:03:42.903\nIf DHTPs already set up,\nhow do I get them to use mine?\n\n72\n00:03:42.903 --> 00:03:45.013\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so DHCP is what we're\ngonna target here, right.\n\n73\n00:03:45.013 --> 00:03:48.210\nDHCP, the dynamic host\nconfiguration protocol.\n\n74\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.790\nWhen you have a laptop, or a tablet, or\n\n75\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.720\na phone,\nit's gonna jump onto wireless networks.\n\n76\n00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.610\nAnd we don't normally do\nstatic pre-assigned IP\n\n77\n00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.700\naddresses on those devices.\n\n78\n00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.210\nSo they connect to the network and\nthey use DHCP.\n\n79\n00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.034\nAnd DCP is a very old protocol.\n\n80\n00:04:04.034 --> 00:04:07.990\nIt's not as old as IPv4,\nbut it's pretty close.\n\n81\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.800\nWhere a client can connect to\na network with no address, and\n\n82\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.270\nsend out a message and say,\nplease somebody, give me an address.\n\n83\n00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.100\nIt's the door up process, right.\n\n84\n00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.130\nThey send out a discover message saying,\nis anybody out there issuing IPs?\n\n85\n00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.420\nAnd then they get an offer from a server,\noffering them an IP address.\n\n86\n00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.059\nAnd then they can request that address and\nit's assigned to them, right D-O-R-A.\n\n87\n00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.635\nWell there's no validation,\n\n88\n00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:32.310\nthere's no authentication that\nhappens as a part of that process.\n\n89\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.690\nThey just say can somebody give me an IP?\n\n90\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.926\nAnd they'll take the first response\nthey get, regardless of who it's from.\n\n91\n00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:44.388\nSo if we bring up our own DHCP server,\nwe can issue whatever IPs we want,\n\n92\n00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:48.420\nand they're going to accept it,\ncuz we're first.\n\n93\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.730\nAnd more importantly, with DHCP,\nyou can pass more than just an IP address.\n\n94\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.770\nWe can pass the default gateway,\nand we can pass the DNS servers,\n\n95\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.100\nthe name resolution servers, to be used.\n\n96\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.570\nSo by doing this,\nI can get more involved with the network.\n\n97\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.920\nI can become visible as a default gateway,\nas a DHCP server, and\n\n98\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.000\nstart intercepting a lot of that.\n\n99\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.720\nSo going back to my diagram,\n\n100\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.240\nthat rogue access point isn't just\ngonna be an access point anymore.\n\n101\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.930\nNow it's going to be a router,\nnow it's going to\n\n102\n00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.000\nbe something a little more involved\ncuz it can issue these addresses.\n\n103\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.260\nAnd when the clients connect,\nwhen an iPhone or a tablet, a laptop,\n\n104\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.780\nwhen it connects it'll request an address.\n\n105\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.521\nI'll issue it one, and for DNS,\nI'll specify my own server.\n\n106\n00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:33.644\nMy own server will be able to take over\nthat role of issuing out IP addresses, or\n\n107\n00:05:33.644 --> 00:05:36.210\nnot, sorry, DHCP,\nit used to be IP addresses.\n\n108\n00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.560\nBut then my DNS server will respond for\n\n109\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.120\nresolution lookups and give out the bad\nIPs, the IPs that point to my service.\n\n110\n00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.570\nThat's what we're going\nto take over right here,\n\n111\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.810\nand you'll see it's\nactually not that hard.\n\n112\n00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.100\nBut we do have to get\na little more involved.\n\n113\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.450\nSo I'm adding some extra\nhardware to my desk, right?\n\n114\n00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.930\nSo yesterday up here on\nthe podium we had our\n\n115\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.450\nlittle access point which is\nthe Rogue AP that brought.\n\n116\n00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.710\nBut my access point is actually\na dedicated access point.\n\n117\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.590\nIt doesn't have a switch built into it.\n\n118\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.170\nIt doesn't have a router built into it.\n\n119\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.150\nSo I'm adding another device into the mix.\n\n120\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.700\nThis little red box right here.\n\n121\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.430\nAnd what this red box is,\nis a very, very tiny firewall.\n\n122\n00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.130\nRight, it's a pfSense firewalls from,\nI think, Netgate.\n\n123\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.022\nAnd it just has two interfaces,\na LAN and a WAN interface.\n\n124\n00:06:17.022 --> 00:06:21.886\nAnd so I've got the access point run\nright into LAN interface so that I can\n\n125\n00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:27.370\ncreate a local area network that's\nconfigured the way that I want it, right.\n\n126\n00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.170\nThat has IP schemes\nthe way that I want it,\n\n127\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.522\nthat has a DNS server the way that I\nwant it, that's completely controlled.\n\n128\n00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd then the WAN interface is connected\nto our regular studio network.\n\n129\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.768\nSo if somebody's trying to connect\nto studio network, they can hit my\n\n130\n00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:43.610\nrogue access point and I control them But\nthey can still access the studio.\n\n131\n00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.041\nAnd they have similar boxes to these where\nthe WAN interface can just be a WiFi card.\n\n132\n00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:48.645\nSo you jump on a regular WiFi network,\n\n133\n00:06:48.645 --> 00:06:51.004\nmeanwhile you're impersonating\nthat same network and\n\n134\n00:06:51.004 --> 00:06:54.130\nyou're able to intercept traffic that\nway or you create an open network.\n\n135\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.995\nThere's a number of different\nways to pull this off and\n\n136\n00:06:56.995 --> 00:07:00.185\nthe equipment is very inexpensive and\nvery simple, right?\n\n137\n00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:05.009\nSo now that that's up I've got it plugged\nin that's gonna become the default gateway\n\n138\n00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:06.090\nfor this network.\n\n139\n00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.650\nNow most of these devices are already\nset up to function in that role.\n\n140\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.110\nWe don't really have to do\nanything too special to them.\n\n141\n00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.700\nLet me show you.\n\n142\n00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.912\nI've got the firewalls configuration\nscreen pulled up here and\n\n143\n00:07:15.912 --> 00:07:19.032\nin it's configuration,\non most firewalls and\n\n144\n00:07:19.032 --> 00:07:22.778\nrouters, they have their WAN\ninterface set up for DACP.\n\n145\n00:07:22.778 --> 00:07:26.334\nAnd so on the WAN side of things I\ncan see well mine is already set for\n\n146\n00:07:26.334 --> 00:07:30.160\n10.0.14.105 that's an IP\naddress here in our studio.\n\n147\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.743\nIt grabbed the regular IP,\nbut on the LAN side,\n\n148\n00:07:33.743 --> 00:07:37.425\nthe LAN side that's facing my victims,\nright?\n\n149\n00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:42.200\nThe people that are on my wireless network\nit's 192.168.1.1 that's different than\n\n150\n00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.540\nthe network we normally\nuse here in the studio.\n\n151\n00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.960\nNow is and end user gonna notice that?\n\n152\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.780\nNo.\n\n153\n00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.747\nPeople connect to wireless\nnetworks all the time and\n\n154\n00:07:49.747 --> 00:07:51.141\nnever know what their IP address is.\n\n155\n00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:55.060\nIn fact,\nit's almost unintentionally difficult.\n\n156\n00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.542\nSo if I take like my Android phone here,\nso this is my Android phone, And\n\n157\n00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:02.109\nit is on the rogue access point, right.\n\n158\n00:08:02.109 --> 00:08:04.470\nIt connected,\nwe saw that in the last episode.\n\n159\n00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.400\nIf I jump into its settings and\n\n160\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.570\nI go into wi-fi, I can see\nthe network that I'm connected to and\n\n161\n00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.820\nit tells me the IP address right there,\nso I can see 192.168.1.101.\n\n162\n00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.110\nAs an end user if they went all\nthe way in they might see that and\n\n163\n00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.390\nsay whoa the IP doesn't,\nthat's not my normal range.\n\n164\n00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.610\nBut end users don't know the normal range,\n\n165\n00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.580\nthey don't know an IP address\nfrom a phone number, right?\n\n166\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.570\nSo they're not going to be able\nto recognize that's changed.\n\n167\n00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.822\nAnd more importantly,\nwhat DNS servers am I using?\n\n168\n00:08:32.822 --> 00:08:35.657\nIt doesn't tell me, right,\nit doesn't even say that right here,\n\n169\n00:08:35.657 --> 00:08:37.670\nit's not showing what\nDNS servers I'm using.\n\n170\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.255\nSo I might be using a valid IP range.\n\n171\n00:08:40.255 --> 00:08:44.539\nBut providing bad DNS servers and\nI'm not gonna see that here, okay?\n\n172\n00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:47.667\nNow, let's talk about that bad DNS server\ncuz that's kind of a critical piece of\n\n173\n00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:48.873\nthis configuration, right?\n\n174\n00:08:48.873 --> 00:08:51.438\nWhen I get that setup,\nthere's a few ways I can do this.\n\n175\n00:08:51.438 --> 00:08:53.683\nI can poison an existing DNS servers.\n\n176\n00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:55.646\nSo if there's a DNS\nserver already in place,\n\n177\n00:08:55.646 --> 00:08:58.450\nwe can do cache poisoning attached\nthrough pre sophisticated.\n\n178\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.534\nBut because I'm able to issue\nDHCP addresses on this network,\n\n179\n00:09:02.534 --> 00:09:04.933\nwhy not just set up my own DNS server?\n\n180\n00:09:04.933 --> 00:09:06.744\nThere's a few different ways\nwe could go about that, so\n\n181\n00:09:06.744 --> 00:09:08.139\nI wanna kind of walk through that process.\n\n182\n00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:12.800\nNow what I've got in the background here\nis a Windows server that's running just in\n\n183\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.950\na virtual machine, right?\n\n184\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.380\nYou can bring up a Window Server or\na Linux Server and\n\n185\n00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.860\nthey both have DNS that's built into them,\nright?\n\n186\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.580\nWindows has the Microsoft DNS server,\non Linux you can bring up bind or\n\n187\n00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.110\nany of a number of other DNS\nservers that are available.\n\n188\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:32.390\nAnd in that DNS server, you control\nwhat you're allowing access to.\n\n189\n00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.540\nSo when I fire up.\n\n190\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.390\nThat DNS or I'm gonna launch\nthe DNS configuration utility.\n\n191\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.620\nI'm going to try to launch\nthe DNS configuration utility.\n\n192\n00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.200\nAnd once I get into it, I can come in and\nI can configure the zones.\n\n193\n00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.760\nNow, DNS servers, all of them,\nthe Linux based ones,\n\n194\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.610\nor Unix based ones, the Windows,\neven the Apple one, there configured as\n\n195\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.850\ncaching servers by default which means\nthey don't have any records to resolve.\n\n196\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.210\nSee how my four lookup zones\nhere is basically empty.\n\n197\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:06.960\nWhat they do is they basically\nwill receive lookups.\n\n198\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.470\nAnd just forward them along to\nanother server somewhere else, right?\n\n199\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.640\nAnd so, if I were to take this one and\npull up its configuration,\n\n200\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.660\nwe could go in and see that it's set to\nforward out to what are called the root\n\n201\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.900\nhint servers,\nthe big guys out there on the Internet.\n\n202\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.260\nAnd that's fine with me,\nI don't care who it forwards to.\n\n203\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.540\nI just need to intercept certain\ndomains here to override it.\n\n204\n00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.640\nSo I need to figure out\nwho I want to attack.\n\n205\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.660\nMaybe I want to attack ITProTV,\nI'll attack our website.\n\n206\n00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.700\nWhat I want is a user to connect my rogue\naccess point and when they go to ITProTV,\n\n207\n00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.690\ninstead of getting our page,\nI want them to get an attack page.\n\n208\n00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.780\nSo to do that,\nI need two kinds of components here.\n\n209\n00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.310\nI need a DNS server and\nI need a web server.\n\n210\n00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.230\nThe web server's gonna host\nthe actual attack page.\n\n211\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.660\nThe DNS server is gonna direct\npeople to that attack page.\n\n212\n00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.000\nSo let's get started with\nmy configuration here.\n\n213\n00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.560\nSo I'm gonna pull up\nthe server here real quick,\n\n214\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.980\njust to make sure that\nit is set to forward.\n\n215\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.000\nWhen I pull up Properties on that\nserver and I go to the Forwarders tab,\n\n216\n00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.810\nhere I can see where it would forward\nto another DNS server that's out there.\n\n217\n00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.853\nIts empty right now and that's fine\nbecause that means it's gonna use the root\n\n218\n00:11:09.853 --> 00:11:11.340\nhint services as long as it got those.\n\n219\n00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.510\nBut I could override the forward or you\nneeded to forward to a local DNS server.\n\n220\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.550\nIf I'm sitting in between a local DNS\nserver on the network I might wanna hide\n\n221\n00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.920\nmyself even more and add that in.\n\n222\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.300\nAnd so we could just hit\nthe edit button there and\n\n223\n00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.160\npunch in the IP address of another server.\n\n224\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.990\nI'll punch in 8.8.8.8 which is\none of Google's servers, right?\n\n225\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.080\nSo I'll feed that in there and\nnow I know that I'm forwarding.\n\n226\n00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.460\nIf I get a request for\na domain that I don't have a record for\n\n227\n00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.440\nI'll forward it on.\n\n228\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.920\nThat's important to make\npeople not suspicious.\n\n229\n00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.610\nWe need to be able to do real look ups for\nnormal traffic we don't care about so\n\n230\n00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.530\nthat they don't get suspicious for\nthe traffic that we do care about right?\n\n231\n00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.960\nNow I want to attack ITPro.TV.\n\n232\n00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.870\nRight?\nSo\n\n233\n00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.910\nI'm gonna right click on my four\nlookup zones here and choose New Zone.\n\n234\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:12:00.200\nAnd I'm gonna add a zone, a Primary zone,\nwhich is going to be for ITProTV, right.\n\n235\n00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.810\nSo my Primary zone is what I'm picking.\n\n236\n00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:09.716\nAnd as I move forward I just need to\ngive it the name, so it's ITPro.TV,\n\n237\n00:12:09.716 --> 00:12:13.790\nand then it's got a file name right,\nI don't really care about the file name so\n\n238\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.640\nI'll just move forward and\nlet it finish that.\n\n239\n00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.940\nIt's got the ability to support\ndynamic updates, I don't need that.\n\n240\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.070\nIf you're doing this on a Unix or\n\n241\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.330\nLinux server you won't even bother\nwith the dynamic updates anyway.\n\n242\n00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.560\nI just need to get that zone created.\n\n243\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.490\nSo I'll hit finish and\nnot I got an ITPRO.TV zone.\n\n244\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:32.286\nNow as soon as I did that,\nwhat's gonna happen is my server can\n\n245\n00:12:32.286 --> 00:12:35.893\nnow do look ups for\nITPRO.TV but it's empty.\n\n246\n00:12:35.893 --> 00:12:40.153\nSo any look up that happens in ITPRO.TV\nright now is gonna get dropped,\n\n247\n00:12:40.153 --> 00:12:43.999\nit's not gonna result properly,\nit's not gonna work, okay?\n\n248\n00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:48.171\nSo I need to create records in here\nthat point to my attack server.\n\n249\n00:12:48.171 --> 00:12:52.232\nSo I need to stand up a web server\nsomewhere and have my attack page that's\n\n250\n00:12:52.232 --> 00:12:56.238\non that and then I'll be able to create\nthe DNS records that point to it.\n\n251\n00:12:56.238 --> 00:12:59.521\nWell, I'm going to put the attack\nserver right on this DNS server so\n\n252\n00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:03.334\nif I'm running DNS from here, I can\ncertainly run my web server from here too.\n\n253\n00:13:03.334 --> 00:13:06.259\nI could separate them out, but\nhere I'll just put them all together,\n\n254\n00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:08.242\nmaybe we're trying to\nbuild this as a road kit,\n\n255\n00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:10.540\nwhere it all runs from a small\nlike Raspberry Pi right.\n\n256\n00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.920\nI'd want everything running on one system\nif possible to be able to create that.\n\n257\n00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.580\nSo from here what I need to do\nis just create the basic records\n\n258\n00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.830\nneeded to attack it.\n\n259\n00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.205\nI wanna get people who are going to\nITPro.TV, and maybe www.ITPro.TV, right.\n\n260\n00:13:25.205 --> 00:13:27.450\nSo I just need to create those records.\n\n261\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.400\nSo I'll create an A record.\n\n262\n00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.180\nFor well the domain.\n\n263\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.520\nAnd for the domain we just leave it blank,\nand that'll specify the domain.\n\n264\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.460\nAnd then I can put the IP\naddress of the attack server.\n\n265\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:43.021\nSo in my case the attack server\nis actually 192.168.1.10.\n\n266\n00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:44.822\nSo I'll punch that in.\n\n267\n00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.490\nAnd then I'm gonna add another record for\nwww.\n\n268\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.510\nI wanna do that www,\nbecause some people still type it.\n\n269\n00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.710\nNot everybody does, but some people do.\n\n270\n00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.740\nSo I wanna make sure I get both, so\nI'm able to pull off that attack.\n\n271\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.324\nSo, I've got www and\nI'll point at that same IP,\n\n272\n00:14:02.324 --> 00:14:07.588\nonemanshow68.1.10, which is\nthe address of my Windows machine.\n\n273\n00:14:07.588 --> 00:14:13.584\nAll right, so now what's gonna happen is\nif this server receives a look up for\n\n274\n00:14:13.584 --> 00:14:20.890\nitpro.tv or www.itpro.tv it's gonna\nreturn 192.168.1.10 is the address.\n\n275\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.134\nIf it gets a query for anything else,\nany other domain like Facebook.com or\n\n276\n00:14:25.134 --> 00:14:28.386\nGoogle.com It's gonna send\nit out to 8.8.8.8 and\n\n277\n00:14:28.386 --> 00:14:32.255\nthe resolution will happen like normal and\nthey'll get a normal IP.\n\n278\n00:14:32.255 --> 00:14:33.704\nPeople be none the wiser.\n\n279\n00:14:33.704 --> 00:14:38.231\nIf I'm doing a targeted attack\non one domain, all right.\n\n280\n00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:41.730\nNow I need to get people\nto use this DNS server.\n\n281\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.610\nAnd to get them to use it, well,\n\n282\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:48.290\nfrom here what I'm gonna need\nto do is mess around with DHCP.\n\n283\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:53.060\nNow I am using a firewall so if I jump\nback over to my firewall configuration\n\n284\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.300\nright here I can take DHCP and\nmanipulate that so\n\n285\n00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.420\nif I go under my services and DHCP server.\n\n286\n00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.100\nI can pull up the DHCP server\nfrom my lan interface and\n\n287\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.970\nI can see the IP ranges that it's\nhanding out, additional pools.\n\n288\n00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.510\nAnd then right here I can\nsee the DNS servers, right.\n\n289\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.940\nAnd right now they're empty, right.\n\n290\n00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.060\nIt's just handing out whatever\nit's getting on the WAN side.\n\n291\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.210\nSo I'm gonna override that and\n\n292\n00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:25.006\nI'm gonna say instead of handing out\nwhat you get from your WAN side,\n\n293\n00:15:25.006 --> 00:15:30.310\nlet's hand out 192.168.1.10,\nmy rogue DNS server, right?\n\n294\n00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.158\nThat's what I'm gonna hand out.\n\n295\n00:15:31.158 --> 00:15:35.644\nI want people who connect to do name\nresolution against that server, so\n\n296\n00:15:35.644 --> 00:15:40.896\nthat I know that it's gonna be getting the\nresults that I want it to get, all right?\n\n297\n00:15:40.896 --> 00:15:44.010\nNow the thing about DHCP is that it\ndoes require a little bit of patience.\n\n298\n00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.997\nI'm gonna just scroll all the way\nto the bottom here and hit save.\n\n299\n00:15:46.997 --> 00:15:48.110\nSo that'll take effect.\n\n300\n00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.486\nWhen somebody gets a DHCP lease,\nthe lease has a certain period of time,\n\n301\n00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:53.823\nan effective period of time.\n\n302\n00:15:53.823 --> 00:15:55.750\nAnd that period of time\nmight be eight days.\n\n303\n00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.838\nIt could be really long.\n\n304\n00:15:56.838 --> 00:15:59.958\nAnd people will renew their\nlease every time they connect.\n\n305\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.132\nOr at 50% of their lease period.\n\n306\n00:16:03.132 --> 00:16:05.961\nSo, if their lease period is set to\neight days, it could take four days for\n\n307\n00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:07.440\nsomebody to refresh, right?\n\n308\n00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.950\nSo I'm gonna have to be patient here,\nto wait for\n\n309\n00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.960\npeople to start hitting my DNS server.\n\n310\n00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:15.110\nBut I'm the DHCP server, so\nI control those lease times.\n\n311\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.360\nSo inside of my DHCP server, you'll\nusually see a setting in here where you\n\n312\n00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.920\nspecify how long the duration is for\nthe lease.\n\n313\n00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.530\nAnd you can shorten that down to try and\nspeed things up a little bit.\n\n314\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.570\nThe option's buried in here somewhere,\nI think I scrolled past it already.\n\n315\n00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.600\nBut you can set that option,\nshrink it down.\n\n316\n00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.610\nOr what you can do,\nwhat's even easier usually,\n\n317\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.890\nis to just reboot your access point.\n\n318\n00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.030\nThat'll disconnect people, and when they\nreconnect they'll renew their lease.\n\n319\n00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.950\nAnd so, that's a great way to\nmake sure that they connect and\n\n320\n00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.880\nthey start using your DNS server,okay.\n\n321\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.510\nSo, what I'm gonna do here\nis we're gonna have to,\n\n322\n00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.190\nwell I'll do a few other\nthings while we're waiting and\n\n323\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.530\nmaybe somebody else will just\nautomatically refresh, we'll see.\n\n324\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.920\nBut, I need to get clients refreshing and\nthey're gonna start hitting my DNS server.\n\n325\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.264\nThey're gonna hit the DNS server and\n\n326\n00:16:56.264 --> 00:16:58.176\nthey're gonna start doing lookups for\nITPro.TV.\n\n327\n00:16:58.176 --> 00:17:02.630\nAnd when they start doing those lookups\nthey're gonna get my attack we servers.\n\n328\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.100\nSo, I probably need to take care\nof my attack web server, right?\n\n329\n00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.300\nWell, because this is a Windows Server,\nand on a Linux server,\n\n330\n00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.330\nyou could do it to Linux,\nyou have Apache on Windows, you have IIS.\n\n331\n00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.740\nSo I have the IIS web server installed.\n\n332\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.420\nAnd in my web server,\nlet me just bring this guy back up.\n\n333\n00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.570\nIn my web server, I've just\ncreated a really simple web page.\n\n334\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.730\nSo let me bring up the IIS manager here.\n\n335\n00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.470\nSo you can see that I've got\na very simple web server fired up.\n\n336\n00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.740\nIn fact, I installed the IIS role and\n\n337\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.550\nI haven't changed a single\nsetting inside of it.\n\n338\n00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.980\nI just installed it and that's all right.\n\n339\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.670\nSo if you go to add remove features in\nWindows Server, you can check off web\n\n340\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.520\nserver, and then hit add, and\nthat's where I'm at on this server.\n\n341\n00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.388\nSo very,\nvery basic configuration here, but\n\n342\n00:17:45.388 --> 00:17:48.999\nthen the webpage is what's\nactually gonna do the damage.\n\n343\n00:17:48.999 --> 00:17:54.148\nIf I browse into the computer and\ngo into SQL inetpub\\wwwroot that's\n\n344\n00:17:54.148 --> 00:17:59.218\nwhere the webpage is restored that\nthis thing is gonna be serving up.\n\n345\n00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:05.289\nAnd if I come in and\ntake a look at that, woops.\n\n346\n00:18:05.289 --> 00:18:09.958\nLet me try and open this with Notepad or\nsomething other than Internet Explorer.\n\n347\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:13.378\n[LAUGH] So, if I come in and\nI open this little file and\n\n348\n00:18:13.378 --> 00:18:18.330\ntake a look at what's in it,\nI'm gonna see a standard HTML file, right.\n\n349\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.224\nSo, not anything too fancy.\n\n350\n00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:23.630\nLet me make this font a little bigger so\nyou can see.\n\n351\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.280\nExactly what's in here and\nget that word wrap turned off.\n\n352\n00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.430\nAll right, there we go.\n\n353\n00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.240\nSo what this is a very basic HTMl file.\n\n354\n00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.060\nAnd what I'm doing is I'm displaying\nthe ITPro.TV logo, right.\n\n355\n00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.348\nIt's important that when\nyou create a hijack page,\n\n356\n00:18:39.348 --> 00:18:40.810\nthat it looks like the real page.\n\n357\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:41.870\nAnd you can go to the real page and\n\n358\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.359\nyou can usually just pull up the\nproperties of elements to get the address.\n\n359\n00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:47.055\nAnd you can piggyback ride\noff of them at ITPro.TV,\n\n360\n00:18:47.055 --> 00:18:49.149\nwe store all of our images in Amazon S3.\n\n361\n00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:52.890\nAnd so, it was easy for me to go and\npull that right off of the website.\n\n362\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.160\nIf you were to fire up any web browser,\nwell this is a secure browser, so\n\n363\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.970\nit might not work for me.\n\n364\n00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:02.146\nBut if I go to the ITPro.TV website and\nI go to pull it up.\n\n365\n00:19:02.146 --> 00:19:05.790\nActually, what in my,\nI might be hijacking myself here.\n\n366\n00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:06.660\nSo let me cancel.\n\n367\n00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.260\nLet me switch to something else\nto something else outside this\n\n368\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.400\nvirtual environment.\n\n369\n00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.990\nSo, if I go and\n\n370\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:18.110\npull out the ITPro.TV website I can take\ngraphic elements right off of the website.\n\n371\n00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.360\nSo, if I want a logo like this\nlogo up here, you can just kinda\n\n372\n00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.710\nright click on it in your browser and\nchoose tom inspect the element.\n\n373\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.880\nAnd you'll get all the information\nincluding the URL that tells you\n\n374\n00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.230\nwhere that element is stored.\n\n375\n00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.790\nYou can get a copy and\nstore that on your tax server, or\n\n376\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.110\nif you're providing internet access,\nyou can just feed right off of that.\n\n377\n00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.040\nAnd then, it's all that much\nmore realistic cuz the graphics\n\n378\n00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.550\nelements are coming from where\nthat server actually resides.\n\n379\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.058\nSo, assuming that I'm\ndoing that which I am,\n\n380\n00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:48.060\nwe can piggyback that\ninformation right in here.\n\n381\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.820\nSo I've got an image being loaded\nright from the production site,\n\n382\n00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.920\nand then I've got some basic text.\n\n383\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.820\nAnd it's saying like welcome to\nthe ITPro.TV webmail server.\n\n384\n00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.070\nRight and maybe this is a webmail login,\nI should have done mail.itpro.tv or\n\n385\n00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.016\nsomething like that.\n\n386\n00:20:00.016 --> 00:20:02.897\nBut you want text and\ngraphics that matches the site that\n\n387\n00:20:02.897 --> 00:20:06.570\nyou're attacking that's what\nthe exploiter would do.\n\n388\n00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.730\nAnd then,\nyou typically wanna have some form,\n\n389\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.337\nsome way that people can enter in data.\n\n390\n00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:15.253\nAnd so, what I've done here is if\nI'm impersonating a mail server,\n\n391\n00:20:15.253 --> 00:20:18.220\npeople are gonna log in with\nthe username or password, right?\n\n392\n00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.390\nAnd so, I've created a username and\n\n393\n00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.980\npassword field and\na form action that calls another PHP file.\n\n394\n00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.080\nNow, what does that PHP file do?\n\n395\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.320\nIt's up to us in how sophisticated\nwe want this attack to be.\n\n396\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.170\nAt a minimum, it should take the username\nand a password, stick it in a database,\n\n397\n00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.040\nand then display an error message\nthat says incorrect password, right.\n\n398\n00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.630\nWhen you do that,\nwhat's an end user gonna do?\n\n399\n00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.128\nAnd then, user is gonna say I\nmust have typed it wrong and\n\n400\n00:20:42.128 --> 00:20:46.169\nthey're gonna try again, and they're gonna\ntry again and finally give up and they'll,\n\n401\n00:20:46.169 --> 00:20:47.947\nmove on or they'll try it again later.\n\n402\n00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:50.850\nMaybe when your access point is off,\nor they'll call the IT department, but\n\n403\n00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.340\neither way they entered their\npassword more than once.\n\n404\n00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.900\nSo, you have more than one entry\nin your database now to be able\n\n405\n00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.430\nto verify that's a valid username and\npassword, right?\n\n406\n00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:03.180\nOr you could get really sophisticated and\nyou could take that username and password,\n\n407\n00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:08.150\nwrite it to a database, and then forward\nit along to the actual mail server and\n\n408\n00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.190\nrender the mail content in an iFrame.\n\n409\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.050\nBy doing that, now the user\nactually logs in and they have no\n\n410\n00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.440\nidea that you intercepted their username\nand password and stored it, right.\n\n411\n00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.800\nSo, that's a more sophisticated version\nof this attack and it'd be very hard for\n\n412\n00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.102\nan engine to detect that that's happening.\n\n413\n00:21:23.102 --> 00:21:25.830\nAll right, but in mine I'm just\ncalling a simple PHP file and\n\n414\n00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.980\nwhat we do with that PHP file\nis kind of up to us, right.\n\n415\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.220\nSo, that's the attack\npage that I built and\n\n416\n00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:37.590\non my server if I just kinda\nbrowse to myself here,\n\n417\n00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.680\nso I'm gonna browse to 127.0.0.1,\nhere's the attack page, right?\n\n418\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.580\nSo there's our ITPro.TV\nlogo that comes up.\n\n419\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.340\nHere's the user name and the password.\n\n420\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.930\nAnd if it looks exactly like\nthe page users are expecting,\n\n421\n00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.420\nthey won't think twice about it.\n\n422\n00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.510\nHey, I fired up a web browser, and I typed\nin ITPRO.TV and I got my log in form, and\n\n423\n00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:57.000\nI went they won't think twice about it,\nif it looks the same.\n\n424\n00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.590\nIf it looks different,\nnow they can be suspect.\n\n425\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.398\nBut, you can still be\nkinda sophisticated there.\n\n426\n00:22:02.398 --> 00:22:06.044\nIf you create a page that says\nsomething like, error accessing system,\n\n427\n00:22:06.044 --> 00:22:08.230\nyou must change your password.\n\n428\n00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.570\nAnd then, you have a field that says,\nput in your user name,\n\n429\n00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.020\nput in your existing passwords, and then\ntwo fields for putting in a new password.\n\n430\n00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.950\nWell the new password,\nyou just throw away, who cares about that?\n\n431\n00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.480\nBut the other still in there\nyou can do things like that,\n\n432\n00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.830\nthat really trick and end user.\n\n433\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.370\nIt's part of social engineering.\n\n434\n00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.700\nAnd impart of a good attack, right?\n\n435\n00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.040\nBut in this case I've got just a simple\npage being rendered on this web server and\n\n436\n00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.400\nif DNS is redirecting people to this page.\n\n437\n00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.690\nThen, we should see that it take effect\nand start redirecting people, all right?\n\n438\n00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.290\nSo, let me jump back out to\nmy mobile phone real quick.\n\n439\n00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.480\nAnd I'm gonna pull that one right here.\n\n440\n00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.530\nOkay, so here's my Android phone again.\n\n441\n00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:49.770\nAnd I don't know if my Android phone\nhas renewed its DHCP address or not, so\n\n442\n00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.770\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm just\ngonna turn its wi-fi off.\n\n443\n00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.650\nRight, so it's gonna drop off the network,\nand then I'll turn its wi-fi back on.\n\n444\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.660\nAnd that's gonna make sure that\nit does renew its DHCP lease.\n\n445\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:07.950\nAnd so, it should get new settings, which\nshould include the new DNS servers, right?\n\n446\n00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:12.675\nSo on here, if I were to fire up a web\nbrowser and I were to go somewhere like\n\n447\n00:23:12.675 --> 00:23:17.450\nCNN.com which I just did there,\nI'm able to get there, right?\n\n448\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.445\nI should have look up\nagainst the rogue server.\n\n449\n00:23:19.445 --> 00:23:21.585\nBut the rogue server would've\njust forwarded it along and\n\n450\n00:23:21.585 --> 00:23:23.225\nthen, we get to the page.\n\n451\n00:23:23.225 --> 00:23:26.895\nAnd it's loading slowly, but\nthat's not the DNS server's fault.\n\n452\n00:23:26.895 --> 00:23:31.847\nSo now if I try and\ngo to say, ITPro.TV, right?\n\n453\n00:23:31.847 --> 00:23:34.415\nWhen I try and go to that,\nlook what I get.\n\n454\n00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:36.330\nI got hijacked, right?\n\n455\n00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.210\nI don't know it, right.\n\n456\n00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.850\nI went, I typed rogue server and I got\nan ITPro.TV page, and here's a form and\n\n457\n00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.090\nI can type in my username and my password.\n\n458\n00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:47.790\nAs an end user I don't even know\nthat I just got intercepted, right?\n\n459\n00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.320\nOur session just got hijacked,\nthat we were trying to get to ITPro.TV.\n\n460\n00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.120\nWe were provided a wrong IP.\n\n461\n00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.227\nWe were sent to an attack server.\n\n462\n00:23:54.227 --> 00:23:58.100\nAnd if it's made to look convincing\nenough, users will log in, right?\n\n463\n00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.000\nThat's kind of the,\nthe heart of this attack.\n\n464\n00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.623\nAll right Don, so\nnow that we've seen this attack and\n\n465\n00:24:03.623 --> 00:24:06.380\nto me it's now getting scary\nsince this is our website.\n\n466\n00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.310\nHow do we mitigate an attack like this?\n\n467\n00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.820\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n468\n00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.310\nthese are tough to mitigate because a lot\nof it comes down to the end user, right?\n\n469\n00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.970\nThe mitigation techniques we talked about\nin the last episode like securing your\n\n470\n00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.670\nwireless network or\ncertificate authentication.\n\n471\n00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.920\nThat can really help,\nthat can stop a lot of this.\n\n472\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.840\nOn the client side though,\nit's really using secure websites, right?\n\n473\n00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.441\nWhen you go to a website\nthat's using SSL or TLS.\n\n474\n00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:30.223\nA lot of us think, yeah,\nthat's there to encrypt our session so\n\n475\n00:24:30.223 --> 00:24:31.530\nwe know our data's private.\n\n476\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.840\nBut the main purpose of SSL is not\nactually to ensure privacy but\n\n477\n00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.110\nto ensure that you are talking to the\nperson you think you're talking to, right?\n\n478\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.510\nIt's to validate that that person is who\nthey say they are, right, authentication.\n\n479\n00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.707\nAnd when we connect and\na site has an SSL certificate,\n\n480\n00:24:46.707 --> 00:24:51.609\nif we trust who issued that certificate\nand we trust the site that we're going to,\n\n481\n00:24:51.609 --> 00:24:53.830\nthen we build an encrypted session.\n\n482\n00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:57.120\nAnd yes, our data is private,\nthat's the secondary action, right?\n\n483\n00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.750\nBut the validation of identity\nis kind of the primary purpose.\n\n484\n00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.880\nSo if we throw SSL into the mix,\n\n485\n00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.650\nthis whole hijack starts to\nbreak down a good bit, right?\n\n486\n00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.070\nSo if I'm an attacker,\nlet me go back to my web server.\n\n487\n00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.500\nAnd so here's the rogue web\nserver that I brought up.\n\n488\n00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.880\nAnd if I go back into IIS, if somebody\ntries to connect with an HTTPS right now,\n\n489\n00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.060\nright, and they do a secure connection,\nI'm not running secure.\n\n490\n00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.750\nBy default IIS doesn't do that, right?\n\n491\n00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.190\nSo if I take my default website and\nI go to Bindings,\n\n492\n00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:31.490\nin the bindings I can see it's only bound\nto port 80 and that's it, all right?\n\n493\n00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:35.000\nSo if I wanna go SSL, I've gotta\ncreate a certificate and attach it.\n\n494\n00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.290\nNow if I'm an attacker,\nI don't have ITProTV certificate.\n\n495\n00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.040\nSo what do I have to do?\n\n496\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.315\nI have to make up my own.\n\n497\n00:25:42.315 --> 00:25:46.340\nAnd if you make up your own,\nit's not going to be trusted, right?\n\n498\n00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.230\nSo I can come in here and\nI can go to my sites.\n\n499\n00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.950\nActually, I need to go up to the server.\n\n500\n00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:56.020\nAnd on the server, I can come in and\nchoose server certificates, and\n\n501\n00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.470\nI can create a certificate.\n\n502\n00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:58.590\nI'll create a self signed one.\n\n503\n00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:05.060\nOne I'm going to sign myself so that I can\nspecify a domain name like ITPro.TV, okay?\n\n504\n00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:10.899\nSo I'm gonna create an ITPro.TV\ncertificate right there.\n\n505\n00:26:10.899 --> 00:26:13.050\nAnd I signed it myself.\n\n506\n00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:16.600\nAnd so now,\nwhen I go to that default web site,\n\n507\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.615\nI can go to Bindings and\nI can add a binding for HTTPS.\n\n508\n00:26:20.615 --> 00:26:22.038\nIt's gonna be port 443.\n\n509\n00:26:22.038 --> 00:26:25.325\nAnd I'm gonna pick that\nITPro.TV certificate.\n\n510\n00:26:25.325 --> 00:26:31.340\nAnd once that's there, now I can\ndo a secure connection, all right?\n\n511\n00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.390\nAnd I believe I have to restart\nthe server for that to work.\n\n512\n00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.790\nSo let me just come in here and\nstop and start the server real quick.\n\n513\n00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:41.650\nAnd once that's done,\nif I'm sitting here on this server, right?\n\n514\n00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:45.435\nSo I'm sitting right here, and\nI fire up my web browser and\n\n515\n00:26:45.435 --> 00:26:48.280\nI browse to https://itpro.tv.\n\n516\n00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:54.020\nActually let's go to 127.0.0.1,\nthere we go.\n\n517\n00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.240\nSo it is actually trying to create\na secure connection, right?\n\n518\n00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.120\nAnd I did it by IP so I'm getting a flag\nthat the certificate doesn't match\n\n519\n00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.264\nthe name I type cuz the name\nis actually itpro.tv, right?\n\n520\n00:27:04.264 --> 00:27:08.143\nIf I were set to use my own DNS server,\nwhich I am not.\n\n521\n00:27:08.143 --> 00:27:11.280\nLet me flip that,\nthis server does have a static IP and\n\n522\n00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.790\nsince it has a static IP,\nmy rogue DNS is not taking effect.\n\n523\n00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:20.705\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\njust override that value that I've got.\n\n524\n00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:25.290\nAnd so we'll just get that set real quick\nso that the rogue DNS can do its job.\n\n525\n00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.064\nOkay, there we go.\n\n526\n00:27:28.064 --> 00:27:30.565\nAll right, so now in the browser,\n\n527\n00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:34.631\nif I browse to https://itpro.tv and\nI browse to it.\n\n528\n00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.829\nHang on, you got Chrome caching that.\n\n529\n00:27:38.829 --> 00:27:44.734\nWell, our Internet Explorer caches lookups\nreally bad, so I've got to change that.\n\n530\n00:27:44.734 --> 00:27:45.345\nThere we go.\n\n531\n00:27:45.345 --> 00:27:47.307\nSee how I'm still getting that\ncertificate error, right?\n\n532\n00:27:47.307 --> 00:27:49.101\nIf I pull up more information,\n\n533\n00:27:49.101 --> 00:27:52.740\nwhat I can see here is now I'm\ngetting kind of a generic.\n\n534\n00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.250\nDarn it.\n\n535\n00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.020\nYou know what, Taylor?\n\n536\n00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:54.569\nLet's do an edit on this.\n\n537\n00:27:54.569 --> 00:27:57.079\nThat's too many mistakes in a row.\n\n538\n00:27:57.079 --> 00:27:59.531\nThat's not the error that I\nwas hoping to see anyway.\n\n539\n00:27:59.531 --> 00:28:07.004\nSo, So Taylor, Let's\n\n540\n00:28:07.004 --> 00:28:11.809\ngo back to the part where I just finished\nassigning the secure certificate, right?\n\n541\n00:28:11.809 --> 00:28:14.869\nSo I created the SSL certificate,\nI added the binding for port 443 and\n\n542\n00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:17.676\nthen I said I think I had to stop\nthe server and start it again, and so\n\n543\n00:28:17.676 --> 00:28:20.120\nI stopped the server,\nand I started it again.\n\n544\n00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.030\nOkay, so right after I started the server,\nlet's pick up right there.\n\n545\n00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:29.030\nAnd then you can just\njump to full screen me.\n\n546\n00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.168\nAnd I'll say right now we'll\njump over to the client,\n\n547\n00:28:32.168 --> 00:28:33.490\nI'll just test it from the client.\n\n548\n00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.410\nThat way I don't have to worry about DNS.\n\n549\n00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.337\nSo you'll look for where I stopped and\nstarted the server and\n\n550\n00:28:39.337 --> 00:28:43.192\nright after I started the server,\nthen we'll pick up with me.\n\n551\n00:28:46.071 --> 00:28:48.880\nAnd before I even get that far,\nlet me just test this real quick.\n\n552\n00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.540\nMy zoom is not working right this morning.\n\n553\n00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:58.569\nThere we go.\n\n554\n00:29:06.147 --> 00:29:11.082\n&gt;&gt; Is there any kind of transition\nRonnie could make, possibly?\n\n555\n00:29:15.708 --> 00:29:18.901\n&gt;&gt; You could throw in a question and\nsay like,\n\n556\n00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:24.578\nwell if you've got an SSL certificate,\nthen isn't that just gonna work and\n\n557\n00:29:24.578 --> 00:29:27.785\nisn't the client just gonna accept that?\n\n558\n00:29:27.785 --> 00:29:32.138\nAnd so I can jump in and\nshow how the problem is trust.\n\n559\n00:29:32.138 --> 00:29:33.237\nDoes that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n560\n00:29:40.009 --> 00:29:43.538\n&gt;&gt; Is that fine [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that'd be fine.\n\n561\n00:30:00.008 --> 00:30:00.734\nOkay.\n\n562\n00:30:04.105 --> 00:30:06.231\nAll right, so Don,\nnow that we have that certificate,\n\n563\n00:30:06.231 --> 00:30:08.110\nthe client's just gonna trust it.\n\n564\n00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.250\nIs that all we have to do?\n\n565\n00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.809\n&gt;&gt; Well, so if the client trusted it,\nwe'd have a real problem, right?\n\n566\n00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:13.478\nCuz then we'd have a valid attack.\n\n567\n00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:15.843\nThe clients could switch to HTTPs and\nit wouldn't be a problem but\n\n568\n00:30:15.843 --> 00:30:17.875\nlet me show you what's\nactually gonna happen, right?\n\n569\n00:30:17.875 --> 00:30:20.390\nSo if I go back to my phone,\nwhich has gone to sleep.\n\n570\n00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:21.245\nThere we go.\n\n571\n00:30:21.245 --> 00:30:25.880\nSo if I go back to my phone, when I browse\nto itpro.tv, it wasn't secure, right?\n\n572\n00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.750\nAnd so it loaded that page and\nit wasn't a big deal, but if I come in and\n\n573\n00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:34.905\nI add an s to that, right, so we're gonna\ndo HTTPS, I get this warning, right?\n\n574\n00:30:34.905 --> 00:30:39.131\nI get a warning that says, hey, there is\na certificate, you could go encrypted, but\n\n575\n00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:40.558\nthere's a problem with it.\n\n576\n00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:42.692\nAnd if I hit View Certificate,\n\n577\n00:30:42.692 --> 00:30:47.793\nit'll show me that it's been issued\nfrom a common name of Don's server.\n\n578\n00:30:47.793 --> 00:30:50.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What is that, right?\n\n579\n00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.180\nThat's not ITProTV, that's Don's server.\n\n580\n00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.660\nWe don't trust that, we don't trust\nthe people that issued the cert.\n\n581\n00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.820\nIn this case it's an attacker, and\nwe shouldn't trust that, right?\n\n582\n00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.980\nBut here's the problem with this.\n\n583\n00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.690\nFirst off, problem number one is that most\nend users don't know what this means,\n\n584\n00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.210\nright, and a lot of web browsers\ngive a way to override.\n\n585\n00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:09.370\nI can just hit Continue.\n\n586\n00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.600\nHey, I'll continue, and here's the page.\n\n587\n00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.960\nAnd now I've got what I think\nis a secure connection,\n\n588\n00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.150\nbut is using a certificate\nthat's from the attacker.\n\n589\n00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.480\nSo even though the data's encrypted\nthe attacker can just decrypt it.\n\n590\n00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.200\nIt's actually already being\ndone automatically, right?\n\n591\n00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.310\nThe other problem here is that\n\n592\n00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.420\nnot everybody types in https\nwhen they browse to a site.\n\n593\n00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.310\nWhat do we expect?\n\n594\n00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:33.642\nWe type in facebook.com,\nor we type in amazon.com.\n\n595\n00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:37.858\nAnd we expect those pages\nto flip us to SSL, right?\n\n596\n00:31:37.858 --> 00:31:39.569\nWell an attacker's not gonna flip you.\n\n597\n00:31:39.569 --> 00:31:42.386\nThey're gonna leave it unencrypted,\nso you go to www.itprotv.tv and\n\n598\n00:31:42.386 --> 00:31:45.308\nit leaves you unencrypted for that\nsession unless you type it in yourself.\n\n599\n00:31:45.308 --> 00:31:46.822\nSo that's the other problem, right?\n\n600\n00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:48.031\nSo as an end user,\n\n601\n00:31:48.031 --> 00:31:53.050\nthe way you can help to mitigate this\nis to always use secure connections.\n\n602\n00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.354\nIf you type it in, that's fine.\n\n603\n00:31:54.354 --> 00:31:57.740\nBut there's even plug-ins\nout there like this guy.\n\n604\n00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.540\nThis is the HTTPS Everywhere\nplug-in that's available\n\n605\n00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.121\nin the Chrome Extension Store.\n\n606\n00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:04.700\nAnd when you load this, this is from EFF,\n\n607\n00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.970\nthe what is it Electronic\nFrontier Foundation or whatever.\n\n608\n00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.810\nThey basically are big supporters and\n\n609\n00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:16.230\nproponents of free and\nopen source, and safe computing.\n\n610\n00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.900\nAnd so they created this plug in, and\nwhat this extension does is it says,\n\n611\n00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.860\nno matter what you type,\nit's just automatically gonna HTTPS.\n\n612\n00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.680\nAnd that way, if you hit a site\nthat has an invalid certificate,\n\n613\n00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.130\nyou're guaranteed to see that pop up,\nnot just continue on encrypted, right?\n\n614\n00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:32.778\nSo those are some of the steps that we can\ntake to mitigate that if I'm using HTTPS\n\n615\n00:32:32.778 --> 00:32:33.444\neverywhere.\n\n616\n00:32:33.444 --> 00:32:36.600\nWhen I go to that site I'm definitely\ngonna see this certificate warning.\n\n617\n00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.950\nBut it didn't take a whole lot of\nsophistication to pull off this attack\n\n618\n00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.220\nJust took some basic resources.\n\n619\n00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.470\nAnd I used a Windows server which\nis super easy, cuz you have a GUI,\n\n620\n00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.980\nbut I could've used a very\nsimple Linux installation.\n\n621\n00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.420\nI could've used a Raspberry Pi, right?\n\n622\n00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.940\nBring up Unix-bind is not very hard,\nand then we can use DHCP and\n\n623\n00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.440\nall that right inside of a Raspberry Pi.\n\n624\n00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.850\nThis entire attack contained\nin a little tiny box.\n\n625\n00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.420\nAnd that is something that happens.\n\n626\n00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:05.930\nThis is a real world attack that you're\ngonna see not a difficult one to pull off,\n\n627\n00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.340\nand now you can start sending\npeople to all sorts of pages and\n\n628\n00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.550\nharvesting their data.\n\n629\n00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.320\nAnd even doing it in a way where most\nend users aren't going to notice.\n\n630\n00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.540\nThat's a big challenge\nthat we're up against.\n\n631\n00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.990\n&gt;&gt; All right Don,\nwell that's a lot of information for\n\n632\n00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.410\nthis demonstration that we had and\ntaking a look at an impersonation attack.\n\n633\n00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:24.410\nMaria, what you saw in this episode\nis Don really trying to let us\n\n634\n00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:27.870\nsee how easy it is to pull\noff this type of attack.\n\n635\n00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:33.020\nHe showed setting up of course the DHCP\nserver which allows us to hand out the DNS\n\n636\n00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:37.350\nthe way that we wanted to and the end user\ndoesn't even know about it a lot of times.\n\n637\n00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.670\nAnd then of course, we even talked\nthe mitigation factors here as well.\n\n638\n00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.440\nTake a look at this demonstration\na couple of different times cuz\n\n639\n00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.048\nthey're all a lot of components to it.\n\n640\n00:33:45.048 --> 00:33:49.200\nSo, Dan any the last words before\nwe close out of this segment.\n\n641\n00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.650\n&gt;&gt; The main lesson what we learnt is that\n\n642\n00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.775\nwhen you're connecting to a wireless\nnetwork, you shouldn't trust.\n\n643\n00:33:54.775 --> 00:33:55.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even\n\n644\n00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.560\neven if it's a network that you\nknow it's your company's network.\n\n645\n00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.170\nYou shouldn't trust it because\nit could be a rogue network.\n\n646\n00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.000\nAnd once you're on that rogue network,\n\n647\n00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.880\nwhoever is controlling the rogue network\ncan do whatever they want, right?\n\n648\n00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.570\nSo we've gotta make sure that we're doing\nproper authentication and validation.\n\n649\n00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:12.330\nIt needs to be both ways, that our servers\nneed to be validating our clients and our\n\n650\n00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:15.000\nclients need to be validating the servers\nto make sure that we are connecting to\n\n651\n00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.320\nthe legitimate real deal when\nwe get on the network, right?\n\n652\n00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.380\nThat's the main lesson to learn here.\n\n653\n00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, that's a great reminder and\na great place for\n\n654\n00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.470\nus to also end this particular segment.\n\n655\n00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:28.990\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n656\n00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:30.020\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n657\n00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:34.561\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more emerging\ntechnology security demonstrations.\n\n658\n00:34:34.561 --> 00:34:40.529\n[MUSIC]\n\n659\n00:34:40.529 --> 00:34:44.174\nThank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.276\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:13.489\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to ITPRO.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.770\nyou're watching another emerging\ntechnology security demonstration.\n\n6\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.170\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.690\nAnd today, we're actually gonna be taking\na look at executing a remote attack.\n\n8\n00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.130\nAnd here to help us set this\nup is gonna be Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.470\nDon, welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.470\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.140\nWe're gonna continue with what we've kinda\nset up in the last two episodes where\n\n12\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.630\nfirst we set up a rogue access point\nthat allowed us to perform a man in\n\n13\n00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.340\nthe middle attack.\n\n14\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.024\nReally eavesdropping.\n\n15\n00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:39.710\nWe were intercepting traffic and\nrecording it.\n\n16\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.734\nAnd then in the next episode, we started\ngetting a little more involved, right?\n\n17\n00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:44.751\nWe did some DNS hijacking and\n\n18\n00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:48.790\nwe started directing people\nto a false spoofed website.\n\n19\n00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.362\nA fake website that we're able\nto intercept login data and\n\n20\n00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:54.590\nthen harvest private information\nabout users that way.\n\n21\n00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.560\nBut, both of those kind of relied\non the user to come to us, right?\n\n22\n00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.220\nWe were tricking the user\ninto doing something for us.\n\n23\n00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.610\nIn this episode I want to switch gears and\ngo into attack mode.\n\n24\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.690\nAnd say, all right let's not wait for\nthem to come to us.\n\n25\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.830\nLet's see if we can't reach out and\nbasically break into their device and\n\n26\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.840\ndo this remotely if possible.\n\n27\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.424\nNow, remote exploits are extremely\ntough to pull off because if vendors\n\n28\n00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:21.497\nare doing their job right,\nthey should get patched right away.\n\n29\n00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:24.430\nAnd that renders the remote\nexploit useless.\n\n30\n00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.260\nBut, there still server out there\nthat are able to be exploded.\n\n31\n00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.140\nAnd one of the main reasons\nsuch as a problem for us, is\n\n32\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.400\na list in United States, your cell phones\nare not guaranteed to get up date.\n\n33\n00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.610\nWe see this in android world all the time.\n\n34\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.784\nThe phone that actually got setting here\nbesides me that I been using on the shell,\n\n35\n00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:44.753\nI got a couple of phones.\n\n36\n00:01:44.753 --> 00:01:47.561\nBut, main while I've been using\nin the shell is Acer phone and\n\n37\n00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:49.190\nthis one you can still get it today.\n\n38\n00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.510\nThey still sell it.\n\n39\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.920\nWhen I got it it had an update that came\nout immediately like within a month,\n\n40\n00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.270\nand there was another security update\nthat happened in the second month.\n\n41\n00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.230\nAnd then, there has not been another\nupdate for this phone in over 14 months.\n\n42\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.760\n14 months with no updates.\n\n43\n00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.497\nNow, in the meantime there have been a ton\nof Android exploits that have come out.\n\n44\n00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:15.290\nAnd in many of them are remote executables\nand so on, which are very, very dangerous.\n\n45\n00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.620\nBut, for some reason either ASUS or\nAT&amp;T have chosen not to patch it.\n\n46\n00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.220\nNow, sometimes the vendor,\nlike ASUS, they'll patch it.\n\n47\n00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.710\nBut AT&amp;T controls the phone, they control\nthe roll out, and it doesn't get patched.\n\n48\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.510\nSo, now there could be an exploit.\n\n49\n00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.320\nSo, that's something we have to worry\nabout as network administrators.\n\n50\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.249\nIf you're trying to protect your users,\n\n51\n00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.951\nwe've got to make sure that we're choosing\ndevices that are getting patched.\n\n52\n00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:41.410\nAnd updated and\nthat they're secure and kept that way.\n\n53\n00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.800\nBut, in this episode we're going\nto show the other side of that.\n\n54\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.010\nIf you're the attacked, you're hoping\nto find those phones that havent'\n\n55\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.550\nbeen patched, because those are ones\nthat we can easily take advantage of.\n\n56\n00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.950\nAnd so, in this episode we're gonna\ntake a look at using Kali Linux,\n\n57\n00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.820\na special security based\nLinux distribution.\n\n58\n00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.260\nTo identify, intercept, and\n\n59\n00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.570\nultimately exploit a remote\ndevice without ever touching it.\n\n60\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.640\nBy doing it completely over the network.\n\n61\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\nthis is really interesting to me, so\n\n62\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.600\nhow are we gonna get started to\nbe able to get access to that\n\n63\n00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.344\nphone without every touching\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n64\n00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:14.236\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna build\noff of what we did in the last episode.\n\n65\n00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:17.383\nAnd in the last episode we set up\na website that was impersonating another\n\n66\n00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:18.010\none, right?\n\n67\n00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.810\nWe built up a fake ITPro.TV website, and\n\n68\n00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.500\nwhen somebody went to the IT Pro.TV\nwebsite, what do they get?\n\n69\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.630\nThey get our fake page, they put in their\ncredentials and we record it, right?\n\n70\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.370\nWe didn't actually do anything to their\ndevice, we just stole their data.\n\n71\n00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.340\nThis time,\n\n72\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.830\nwe're gonna set up a web page that has\nan active exploit built into the page.\n\n73\n00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.070\nSo, the moment they come to that web page,\n\n74\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.070\nthey're gonna get served\na malicious payload.\n\n75\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.400\nAnd that malicious payload\nis going to create a shell.\n\n76\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.810\nIt's gonna create a shell account or\n\n77\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.920\naccess a session from\ntheir phone back to us.\n\n78\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.960\nThey're gonna connect to us.\n\n79\n00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.500\nAnd when that happens, now we can start\nissuing commands against the phone and\n\n80\n00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.220\ntaking it over.\n\n81\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.140\nSo, it's a much mor dangerous much\nmore powerful type of attack.\n\n82\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.410\nAnd you'll see it's really\nnot that hard to tap in.\n\n83\n00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.270\nSo, we gotta get some\nframework set up first.\n\n84\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.360\nSo there's a few things we need to do.\n\n85\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.800\nIn the last episode I used\na Windows DNS server.\n\n86\n00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.760\nI'm not gonna do that this time.\n\n87\n00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.870\nWe're gonna try and do everything we\ncan right here inside of Kali Linux.\n\n88\n00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.480\nIf you've never used Kali Linux before,\nit's free.\n\n89\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.600\nYou can go and download it.\n\n90\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.620\nThey have a bootable DVD, or\nyou can boot of a USB key so\n\n91\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.910\nyou can run it as a live install or\nyou can install it to your machine.\n\n92\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.080\nIt's a Linux distribution.\n\n93\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.520\nAnd it has tons of security\nutilities built in there,\n\n94\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.250\nmostly for penetration testing.\n\n95\n00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.950\nBut, they're great utilities\nto work with as far as\n\n96\n00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.830\nenvironments like this where we want\nto see can we exploit a device.\n\n97\n00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.250\nAre these attacks valid on our network?\n\n98\n00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.270\nWell, the neat thing about it is it has\na lot of tools that let us do some of\n\n99\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.240\nthe things we did in previous episodes.\n\n100\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.640\nSo for example,\n\n101\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.100\none of the things we did in that last\nepisode was to set up a DNS server.\n\n102\n00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.660\nThat was basically\nhijacking DNS lookups for\n\n103\n00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.020\na certain network,\nITPro.TV is what we did.\n\n104\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.070\nWell, I can do that right\nfrom inside Kali Linux.\n\n105\n00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.230\nKali Linux actually has bind installed.\n\n106\n00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.270\nSo, I could use that and\nset up a full-blown DNS server.\n\n107\n00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.800\nBut instead, I can do DNS spoofing with\na neat little utility called dnschef.\n\n108\n00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.410\nAnd what dnschef those is it lets you\nsend dns look up and replace them.\n\n109\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.360\nAnd so we're gong to use that\nto handle our dns loo ups.\n\n110\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.290\nAnd then,\nonce that DNS look up is done we're\n\n111\n00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.438\ngoing to send it to our attack website.\n\n112\n00:05:24.438 --> 00:05:28.170\nAnd I'm gonna bring up the attack website\nright in here using another utility.\n\n113\n00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.241\nWhich is called meta-sploit.\n\n114\n00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:33.420\nMeta-sploit is actually\na lot of utilities.\n\n115\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.580\nIt's not just one utility, but a lot of\nutilities are rolled into one package.\n\n116\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.888\nAnd inside of Kali,\nyou have the Metasploit Framework console.\n\n117\n00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:46.460\nAnd that's gonna allow us\nto access the whole suite\n\n118\n00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.830\nof exploits that are a part of Metasploit.\n\n119\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.230\nSo we'll leverage that to\nactually attack the phone, okay.\n\n120\n00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.580\nBut before we even get there,\n\n121\n00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.550\nI've gotta make it where people can\nget to this attack server, right?\n\n122\n00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.420\nAnd we did that through manipulating DNS\nlast time, which we're gonna do again.\n\n123\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.610\nAnd we were able to manipulate DNS\nbecause we manipulated DHCP, right?\n\n124\n00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.950\nWe got people to use us as the DNS server.\n\n125\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.120\nSo I need to kinda recreate that.\n\n126\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.560\nMy Kali Linux box here, if I take a look,\n\n127\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.510\nI'm gonna run ip addr,\nto figure out what my IP address is.\n\n128\n00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.780\nAnd I can see that my IP\naddress is 192.168.1.100.\n\n129\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.230\nSo my first thing that I need to do, is I\nneed to get clients connecting to my rogue\n\n130\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.590\naccess point, and using me for DNS, okay.\n\n131\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.110\nNow to do that, I'm gonna go and\n\n132\n00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.480\nalter the DHCP server that we\nset up in the last episode.\n\n133\n00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.180\nSo I'm gonna come under my services and\n\n134\n00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.080\nmy DHCP server, and in the last episode,\nI was sending this to a Window server\n\n135\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.960\nthat I had that was set up\nto perform the bad DNS.\n\n136\n00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.014\nNow, I'm gonna be sending it here to my\nKali Linux box which was 192.168.1.100.\n\n137\n00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:57.650\nSo I'm just gonna change that value,\nand I'll save that.\n\n138\n00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:03.320\nSo now, the DACP server is\nhanding out this bad DNS, okay.\n\n139\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.172\nI'm not actually answering\nthe DNS look ups at this point.\n\n140\n00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:07.640\nI kinda need to have that in place, so\n\n141\n00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.460\nsomebody starts doing DNS lookups\nright now they're all gonna fail.\n\n142\n00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.460\nAnd that's gonna raise\na few eyebrows right?\n\n143\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.070\nPeople are gonna start wondering why can't\nI get to any website of this access point,\n\n144\n00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.540\nand I need to run under the radar,\nif possible.\n\n145\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.180\nSo, I don't want the people to know,\nthat I'm doing this hijack.\n\n146\n00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.700\nSo, what I'm gonna do is we get\nback into one of my terminals\n\n147\n00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.240\nand I'm gonna run dnscheft just by itself.\n\n148\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.571\nI'm just gonna type dnscheft by itself and\n\n149\n00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:42.750\nwhen dnscheft runs, it runs in proxy mode.\n\n150\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.470\nIf somebody does a look up right now,\nit's gonna take the look up and\n\n151\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.470\njust forward it to .8.8.8.8 which is\none of google's public DNS server.\n\n152\n00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.788\nSo now DNS is working, right.\n\n153\n00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:55.664\nDHCP is pointing to the DNS queries here,\nand\n\n154\n00:07:55.664 --> 00:07:58.850\ndnschef is just forwarding\nthem along to Google.\n\n155\n00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.760\nI'm now man in the middle in DNS.\n\n156\n00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.402\nRight?\n\n157\n00:08:01.402 --> 00:08:02.999\nBut I'm not overwriting anything just yet.\n\n158\n00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:04.449\nI'm gonna leave this\nrunning to hide myself.\n\n159\n00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:07.570\nI don't want to be detectable just yet.\n\n160\n00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.410\nWe need to get our attack server running.\n\n161\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.460\nSo getting the attack server\nrunning is my next thing.\n\n162\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.310\nAnd I can take my time doing that.\n\n163\n00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.530\nBecause I know that DNS\nis resolving properly.\n\n164\n00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.970\nSo I'm gonna just park DNS Chef\nin the background there, and\n\n165\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.290\nswitch back over to my\nMetasploit framework.\n\n166\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.390\n&gt;&gt; So, Don, in Metasploit,\nis it just Android specific or\n\n167\n00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.500\ncan it work for, well, various devices?\n\n168\n00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.690\n&gt;&gt; It's a good question, right?\n\n169\n00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.570\nCuz I'm about to use it to\ntarget an Android device, right?\n\n170\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.070\nAnd in reality,\nMetasploit can target darn near anything.\n\n171\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.630\nI'm using the free version, right, which\nis built into Kali as the free version.\n\n172\n00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.000\nBut they have a pay version where you sing\nup for service and support with them.\n\n173\n00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.400\nAnd you have tens of thousands of\nexploits that are built into the product.\n\n174\n00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.265\nAnd they can target Windows and\nLinux and Mac OS, Android, iOS.\n\n175\n00:08:50.265 --> 00:08:52.850\nIt can target all sorts of\nthings to be able to test and\n\n176\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.700\nsee whether your devices are vulnerable\nand whether or not they can be exploited.\n\n177\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.780\nSo, I am gonna use it as far as\nAndroid in this example, but\n\n178\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.110\nyou could use it for pretty much anything.\n\n179\n00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.520\nAll right, so speaking of which,\nI got DNS Chef out of the way, and\n\n180\n00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.380\nnow I am back in Metasploit.\n\n181\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.170\nAnd I'm gonna set up my attack server.\n\n182\n00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.820\nAnd I need to tell it that I'm gonna\nbe attacking an Android system.\n\n183\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.070\nYou need to tell it which\nexploit you're gonna use.\n\n184\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.070\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nsay use exploit.\n\n185\n00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.160\nAnd it uses a folder hierarchy to\nkeep track of all the exploits.\n\n186\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.020\nSo I'll say, /android.\n\n187\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.470\nSo I'm getting into\nthe Android folder of exploits.\n\n188\n00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.594\nAnd /browser, I'm attacking\nthe browser that's built into Android.\n\n189\n00:09:32.594 --> 00:09:40.030\nAnd then, web view_addjavascriptinterface,\nall right?\n\n190\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.200\nYou're gonna be pulling up a webpage,\n\n191\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.830\nand I'm gonna inject malicious JavaScript,\nall right?\n\n192\n00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.050\nSo there's a JavaScript attack\nthat's gonna be injected into\n\n193\n00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.580\nthat session when you connect.\n\n194\n00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.390\nAll right, so\nnow it knows the attack I wanna use.\n\n195\n00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.930\nNow I need to tell it how to\nconfigure the attack server.\n\n196\n00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.570\nThe server's gonna be a fake web server,\na virtual server that's on this system.\n\n197\n00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.850\nAnd so it needs to have an IP address.\n\n198\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.160\nIt needs to have a port number.\n\n199\n00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.030\nAnd it needs to have a path for the URL.\n\n200\n00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.460\nSo I've gotta specify each\nof those values here.\n\n201\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.690\nThe first thing I need to do is tell\nit which physical interface I'm gonna\n\n202\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.380\nlisten on.\n\n203\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.660\nAnd we do that by specifying an lhost.\n\n204\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.400\nWe're gonna say that we're listening or we\nhave a local host that has an IP address\n\n205\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.500\nof, and I'm gonna use the IP address\nof my physical interface, all right?\n\n206\n00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.590\nSo, that's the interface that's gonna\nbe running this fake web server.\n\n207\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.330\nThen the fake web server has\nto have an IP address also.\n\n208\n00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.910\nAnd I'm just gonna reuse my existing IP.\n\n209\n00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.000\nBut you might wanna give your\nfake server a different IP.\n\n210\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.270\nNow, why would you do that?\n\n211\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.500\nMaybe I wanna run more than\none instance of Metasploit and\n\n212\n00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.840\nhave different attacks\ngoing on at the same time.\n\n213\n00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.810\nAnd so I might tie them all\nto different IP addresses.\n\n214\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.460\nAnd I can use DNS to redirect\npeople to different IPs.\n\n215\n00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.210\nSo there's a few reasons\nwhy you might use that.\n\n216\n00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.690\nI'm trying to keep mine simple,\nso I'll just reuse the same IP.\n\n217\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.570\nThen, I need to set my server port.\n\n218\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.340\nAnd on the server port, if you leave it\nalone, I think it defaults to port 8080,\n\n219\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.010\nif I remember right.\n\n220\n00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.010\nBut you don't wanna use that anyway\nbecause we're doing a DNS attack.\n\n221\n00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.320\nAnd with a DNS attack, they request\na name, and I give them my IP.\n\n222\n00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.000\nDNS doesn't give a port number.\n\n223\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.480\nSo I can't redirect them to a particular\nport, so I need to stick with either 80 or\n\n224\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.560\n443 to make sure this\nis an effective attack.\n\n225\n00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.100\nI'm gonna stick with 80 because\nmost people will browse to a site\n\n226\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.130\nusing unencrypted and\nthen flip over to encrypted.\n\n227\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.920\nAnd with the nature of this attack,\nI don't care if they flip over, right?\n\n228\n00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.780\nAs long as they connect on the IP,\nthen I can inject my JavaScript attack.\n\n229\n00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.470\nAnd then they can flip onto secure\nwebsites or whatever after that.\n\n230\n00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.130\nAnd that's no big deal to me cuz I've\nalready got the session built up to them.\n\n231\n00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.090\nSo I'm gonna test to port 80.\n\n232\n00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.360\nAnd then lastly,\nI need to set the URI path.\n\n233\n00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.270\nAnd this is the path to the attack files.\n\n234\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.632\nNow, I am attacking the whole server,\nso I'm just going to do a slash.\n\n235\n00:11:49.632 --> 00:11:50.410\nThat's the root, right?\n\n236\n00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.219\nSo set URI path slash.\n\n237\n00:11:52.219 --> 00:11:55.480\nBut you might be attacking\na particular page.\n\n238\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.750\nI might want to attack itpro.tv/login, and\n\n239\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.610\nso you could specify that path right here,\nwhat you wanted that path to be.\n\n240\n00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.839\nBut I am just going to\nhit the main server.\n\n241\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.325\nAll right, now,\n\n242\n00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:08.340\nit's got all the information it needs\nto bring up this attack server.\n\n243\n00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:13.312\nSo, all I need to do is type in exploit,\nand there it goes, right?\n\n244\n00:12:13.312 --> 00:12:18.706\nIt's launched an attack server, and\nit launched a reverse TCP handler, okay?\n\n245\n00:12:18.706 --> 00:12:20.700\nWell, what is that?\n\n246\n00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.970\nWell, a reverse TCP handler\nis like a listener.\n\n247\n00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.880\nI'm listening for people opening a session\nto me so I can exploit it, right?\n\n248\n00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.505\nWell, technically we already\nexploited at that point.\n\n249\n00:12:28.505 --> 00:12:31.385\nWe've got the attack server itself,\nthis guy right here, right?\n\n250\n00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:35.613\nUsing this URL, 192168.1.100:80, right?\n\n251\n00:12:35.613 --> 00:12:37.294\nThat's the attack server.\n\n252\n00:12:37.294 --> 00:12:42.379\nIf somebody hits the attack server,\nand this exploit is valid,\n\n253\n00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:45.581\nit's going to hit them, exploit them,\n\n254\n00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:50.150\nand then they're gonna open\nup a tunnel back to me.\n\n255\n00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:55.150\nAnd when they open that tunnel, it's\ngonna point to 192.160.1.100:4444, right?\n\n256\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.300\nAnd that tunnel,\nit'll know the port number to use cuz it's\n\n257\n00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.800\npart of the JavaScript\ninjection that we do.\n\n258\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.790\nSo then, they reach back and\nopen up a tunnel.\n\n259\n00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.160\nAnd once that tunnel is there,\nthey're exploited.\n\n260\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.368\nI now have access to their system,\nand we can use utilities,\n\n261\n00:13:08.368 --> 00:13:14.010\nI'll use to reach into that system and\nstart executing commands remotely, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.790\nAt this point, I just need to get\npeople to come and visit me, all right?\n\n263\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.220\nWell, how do I do that.\n\n264\n00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.960\nWell, we already went into the firewall\nand changed DHCP to make it so\n\n265\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.670\nthat they were using my DNS server, okay?\n\n266\n00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.690\nSo that was the first step.\n\n267\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.516\nThe next step is I need to start\noverwriting the DNS values for it.pro.tv.\n\n268\n00:13:33.516 --> 00:13:36.840\nIn the last episode we did that\nwith a Windows DNS Server.\n\n269\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.380\nHere, I'm gonna use Kali.\n\n270\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.308\nI'm gonna go and pull up the DNS Chef\nwindow I stuck in the background.\n\n271\n00:13:43.308 --> 00:13:46.736\nAnd in DNSChef,\nwhen you run it just by itself,\n\n272\n00:13:46.736 --> 00:13:52.160\nit's proxying every domain and\ngetting the real IPs and responding back.\n\n273\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.530\nSo people don't even know I'm here,\nand it's proxying.\n\n274\n00:13:55.530 --> 00:14:01.417\nSo if I were to open up\nanother terminal window,\n\n275\n00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:09.460\nand do an nslookup for\nitpro.tv and send it here, right?\n\n276\n00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.470\nIf I take look at DNSChef in\nthe background, see what it says?\n\n277\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.770\nIt said it received\na request from 127.0.0.1,\n\n278\n00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.400\nit received a request from me,\nand it proxied the response.\n\n279\n00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.850\nIt went out and got the real IP and\nthen gave it back to me, right?\n\n280\n00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.260\nSo that was Proxy.\n\n281\n00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.360\nAnd as an end user,\nwe don't know that happens, right?\n\n282\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.670\nSo it's invisible.\n\n283\n00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.800\nBut now, I'm gonna go and I'm gonna stop\nDNSChef for a minute, and I'm gonna change\n\n284\n00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.630\nthe way that it's configured so that\nit's gonna override itpro.tv, all right?\n\n285\n00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.360\nSo with DNSChef, I need to tell it\nthe interface that I'm listening on.\n\n286\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.449\nSo I'll tell it that I'm listening\naround 192.168.1.100, right?\n\n287\n00:14:49.449 --> 00:14:53.350\nWhich by default it's only\nlistening on 127.0.0.1.\n\n288\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.890\nSo I really need to provide\nthis command every time.\n\n289\n00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.700\nI didn't provide it earlier,\nI should have.\n\n290\n00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.550\nBut I need to tell\nthe interface to listen on.\n\n291\n00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:05.530\nThen, I need to tell it what fake\nIP I'm gonna point people to.\n\n292\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:11.000\nSo I'm gonna say fakeip=, and I'm gonna\npoint them to where my attack server is.\n\n293\n00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.950\nMy attack server's right here,\nso it's the same IP.\n\n294\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.440\nYour attack server might\nbe somewhere else, right?\n\n295\n00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.750\nThe fake IP is gonna point\nto wherever it needs to be.\n\n296\n00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.160\nNow, with DNSChef I can only\nspecify one fake IP, so\n\n297\n00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.670\nevery domain I override is all\ngonna go to this one fake IP.\n\n298\n00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.330\nIf I'm trying to setup an impersonation\nattack like in the last episode,\n\n299\n00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.540\nthat doesn't work out here because\nI can't specify more than one IP.\n\n300\n00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.850\nBut for doing a JavaScript attack like\nI'm trying to do, worked out perfect.\n\n301\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.511\nAny domain I override is gonna\nget sent to 192.268.1.100.\n\n302\n00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:40.600\nAnd that's where my attack\nis gonna be waiting.\n\n303\n00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.370\nThen I need to tell it\nwho I want to override.\n\n304\n00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:52.060\nAnd so I'm gonna say --fakedomains=,\nand then the domains I wanna override.\n\n305\n00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.910\nMaybe I wanna override Google.com,\nor ITPro.TV, right?\n\n306\n00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.216\nI do need to be specific.\n\n307\n00:15:58.216 --> 00:16:03.492\nMaybe I wanna get www.Google.com,\nand www.ITPro.tv.\n\n308\n00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:08.470\nBut you just sit here and you list out all\nthe domains that you want to spoof for.\n\n309\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.290\nAnd if somebody does a lookup for\none of these domains,\n\n310\n00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.957\nthey're gonna get the fake IP.\n\n311\n00:16:12.957 --> 00:16:16.190\nAnd if they do a lookup for any other\ndomain, they'll just get proxied.\n\n312\n00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.326\nThey'll get the real IP back,\nand that's that.\n\n313\n00:16:19.326 --> 00:16:20.990\nSo let me execute that.\n\n314\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.700\nNow DNSChef is gonna start back up.\n\n315\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.069\nAnd it should be ready to\nproxy those addresses.\n\n316\n00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:28.190\nLet's see if it is.\n\n317\n00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.660\nI'm gonna go and\ntake this other window back here.\n\n318\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.314\nAnd a moment ago I did a look up for\nITPRO.TV and\n\n319\n00:16:34.314 --> 00:16:38.743\nI got our real IP, 192.124.249.106.\n\n320\n00:16:38.743 --> 00:16:45.250\nNow, I'm gonna do a look up for\nITPRO.TV and we're gonna see, sorry.\n\n321\n00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.170\nWe're not listening on\nthe loopback anymore,\n\n322\n00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.678\nnow we're listening on 192.168.1.100.\n\n323\n00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.340\nSo I need to tell it who I'm listening to.\n\n324\n00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:53.888\nThere we go, all right.\n\n325\n00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:59.050\nAnd instead of getting\n192.124.249.106 back,\n\n326\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:03.370\nnow I get 192.168.1.100, right?\n\n327\n00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.490\nAnd if I look back here at dnschef,\n\n328\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:11.000\nI can see I got a look up request that\ncame in and I cooked the response, right?\n\n329\n00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.570\nCooking the response to\nprovide the fake IP.\n\n330\n00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.160\nIf I were to look up for another domain,\n\n331\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.190\nif I were to look up, say CNN.com,\nI didn't override cnn.com.\n\n332\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.160\nSo it's gonna receive that.\n\n333\n00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.910\nAnd when I go back to DNS Chef,\nit's just proxying that response.\n\n334\n00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:30.780\nIt cooked the response to ITProTV,\nit proxied the response to CNN.\n\n335\n00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.060\nSo now when somebody does a look up,\nthey're getting the fake IP.\n\n336\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.230\nAnd the fake IP Is pointing\nto my attack server.\n\n337\n00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.222\nSo if somebody fires up a web browser and\nthey're using me for DNS.\n\n338\n00:17:42.222 --> 00:17:45.847\nIf they got DHCP from my firewall and\nmy rogue access point,\n\n339\n00:17:45.847 --> 00:17:47.740\nthey're gonna use me for DNS.\n\n340\n00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.520\nAnd when they look up itpro.tv\nthey're gonna get a fake IP.\n\n341\n00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.030\nAnd when they browse,\nthey're gonna go to that server right?\n\n342\n00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.910\nAnd when they hit that server.\n\n343\n00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.970\nThey're gonna get exploited.\n\n344\n00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.810\nWell, maybe, right?\n\n345\n00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.110\nWhen they browse through that server,\nlet me minimize some of these windows,\n\n346\n00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.567\nI got too much stuff going on here.\n\n347\n00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:07.830\nAll right, so here's my attack\nserver that's running, right?\n\n348\n00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.660\nWhen they browse to it,\nthe attack server's gonna see whether or\n\n349\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.040\nnot they're a valid target.\n\n350\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.860\nThey may not be a valid target, right?\n\n351\n00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.556\nSo, if I were to browse there myself,\nright,\n\n352\n00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:19.337\nif I were to just fire up\nmy Firefox window here.\n\n353\n00:18:19.337 --> 00:18:23.109\nAnd I'll browse to 192.168.1.100.\n\n354\n00:18:23.109 --> 00:18:24.967\nAnd when I browse to it, okay,\n\n355\n00:18:24.967 --> 00:18:29.310\nI get a not found error, because\nthe attack server is actually empty.\n\n356\n00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.900\nIt just has the JavaScript attack.\n\n357\n00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.100\nWe could've injected some\nmore content in there.\n\n358\n00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.250\nBut I did browse to it.\n\n359\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.030\nAnd if I take a look back\nat my Metaspoilt window,\n\n360\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.310\nI can see somebody just hit my target,\nright?\n\n361\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.160\nAnd they were asking for\n\n362\n00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.920\nfavorite icon which we definitely\ndidn't have loaded, right?\n\n363\n00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.420\nBut then exploit requirements not met.\n\n364\n00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.680\nOS name vulnerability test.\n\n365\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.700\nIt wasn't the right OS.\n\n366\n00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.170\nI'm targeting Android.\n\n367\n00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.055\nThis is a Linux machine.\n\n368\n00:18:56.055 --> 00:18:59.640\nNow technically Android is Linux but\nthe machine is different, right?\n\n369\n00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.720\nGoogle controls that code\na lot more than just Linux.\n\n370\n00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.650\nAnd then the vulnerability test which was\nhey, if you're not Android, you're not\n\n371\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:10.160\nrunning the Android browser, I can't test\nfor vulnerability, you're not vulnerable.\n\n372\n00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.240\nAnd so the attack wasn't carried out.\n\n373\n00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.550\nNow if I had built a sophisticated\nenough masquerade page.\n\n374\n00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.960\nPeople wouldn't have noticed they\nwere on a malicious page at all,the\n\n375\n00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.470\nattack didn't happen, and they just\nmove on like nothing happened, right?\n\n376\n00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.520\nBut let's see what happens if\nI take my phone and browse.\n\n377\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.030\nNow I am on Android this time and\nI'm gonna browse to ITpro.tv.\n\n378\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.476\nI'm gonna do a DNS lookup, right,\nit'll resolve to the fake IP and\n\n379\n00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:39.850\nthen I'm gonna hit\nthe Metasploit attack server.\n\n380\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:43.713\nThe big difference here is going to\nbe instead of coming up as not being\n\n381\n00:19:43.713 --> 00:19:48.522\nexploitable, we should see the exploiter\nrequirements are met, and that we get in.\n\n382\n00:19:48.522 --> 00:19:50.780\nAll right, so here we can see it's\nstarting to output some data.\n\n383\n00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.420\nWe got somebody connected, and this\ntime gathering target information, and\n\n384\n00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.090\nit was somebody who could be exploited.\n\n385\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.420\nSo right here, we see sending HTML\nresponse, we've got the target.\n\n386\n00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.060\nAnd that browser requested\na favorite icon.\n\n387\n00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.350\nSo everybody wants\na favorite icon these days.\n\n388\n00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.750\nBut I don't care about that because\nthis is the part I care about,\n\n389\n00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.680\nserving x86 exploit.\n\n390\n00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.150\nIt found an exploit for\nthat Android device.\n\n391\n00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.670\nAnd it sent it along to it.\n\n392\n00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:17.640\nAnd as soon as it did, the device on\nthe other side created a tunnel back.\n\n393\n00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.790\nI can see I've got\na Meterpreter session 1 open.\n\n394\n00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:25.080\nThat mobile phone just\nconnected back to me, right?\n\n395\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.130\nThey browsed to an attack site,\nmaybe didn't even know it.\n\n396\n00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.780\nAnd now they've established\nthat tunnel back.\n\n397\n00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.340\nWhat can I do with the tunnel?\n\n398\n00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.510\nWell the real question is what\ncan't I do with the tunnel?\n\n399\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.190\nOnce I can connect to the device this way,\nI can do all sorts of crazy things and\n\n400\n00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.020\nthe interpreter really\nhelps with doing that.\n\n401\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.810\nAll I need to do is to connect sessions.\n\n402\n00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:47.570\nSo, I'm gonna type session- I1.\n\n403\n00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:53.329\nI'm gonna interact with session 1 and\nwhen I do that.\n\n404\n00:20:53.329 --> 00:20:56.680\nIt's actually plural sessions- I1 I.\n\n405\n00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.000\nThere we go.\n\n406\n00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.570\nNow I'm connected to that phone, and\n\n407\n00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.500\nI can start to run a number\nof different commands.\n\n408\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.651\nLet me just pull up the help screen, so\n\n409\n00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:08.240\nyou can kinda see some\nof the stuff we can do.\n\n410\n00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.460\nWe could check to see if\nthe device is rooted.\n\n411\n00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.970\nWe can dump the SMS messages from that, so\n\n412\n00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.540\nwe can get all the text\nmessages that were sent.\n\n413\n00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:21.410\nWe can change the ringer and silence\nthe phone, we can cause activity to start.\n\n414\n00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.970\nBut where it gets really scary is\nwhen we start scrolling back here,\n\n415\n00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.560\nwe can turn on the webcam,\nwe can record the microphone.\n\n416\n00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.500\nWe can send,\n\n417\n00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.270\nsomewhere in here it gives us the ability\nto send text messages as that device.\n\n418\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:35.350\nYou can do a lot of things, right.\n\n419\n00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:39.110\nAnd that's where this stuff really gets,\nit's risky,\n\n420\n00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.260\nespecially if the device is rooted, right?\n\n421\n00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.680\nAnd let's see if this device is rooted.\n\n422\n00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.040\nI'm gonna do a check root,\nand the device is rooted.\n\n423\n00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.880\nSo whoever had this phone, me, rooted it,\nprobably to cheat the video game or\n\n424\n00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.180\nsomething like that, right?\n\n425\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.660\nBut as an attacker, now that I know and\nI can see that it's rooted, so\n\n426\n00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.228\nthat means if I drop to a shell.\n\n427\n00:21:57.228 --> 00:22:00.450\nAnd I get in here,\nI can elevate to root privileges and\n\n428\n00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:05.140\nstart navigating the file system,\nexecuting applications, right.\n\n429\n00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.840\nLet me do a PWD here, and so\nI'm in the root directory right now.\n\n430\n00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.980\nBut maybe I wanna change into the SD\ncard for example, and pull up a listing.\n\n431\n00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.340\nAnd there's the pictures,\ndownloads, movies.\n\n432\n00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.190\nI can start accessing that data or\njust deleting it.\n\n433\n00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.740\nMaybe I'm just an angry person and\nI wanna delete the stuff.\n\n434\n00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.840\nRight, I can do that.\n\n435\n00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.710\nMore importantly though, this session\nis tied to that web browser, right?\n\n436\n00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.472\nThe web browser is how\nthe attack was carried off.\n\n437\n00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:30.350\nWhat's gonna happen when\nthey close the web browser?\n\n438\n00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.680\nThe attack goes away.\n\n439\n00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.950\nSo what I need to do is,\nwhile I've got them, we should script and\n\n440\n00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.860\nautomate this that it immediately\ninjects a persistent attack.\n\n441\n00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.640\nI could load a malicious application\nin here, like load in an APK.\n\n442\n00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.720\nAnd once that's on there,\n\n443\n00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.990\nthat application could be building\nthe tunnel back to the me.\n\n444\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:51.370\nAnd now when I take this phone and\nI go to Starbucks or I go home, it's\n\n445\n00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.560\nbuilding a tunnel back to the attacker and\nnow the attack becomes permanent.\n\n446\n00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.980\nIt's always open.\n\n447\n00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.652\nAnd I can start doing distributed denial\nservice attacks using that phone as one of\n\n448\n00:23:00.652 --> 00:23:04.140\nmy zombies or\nI can just monitor information,\n\n449\n00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.490\nmaybe I turn that microphone on and\njust start recording and\n\n450\n00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.610\nhey let's see what happens in\nthis person's life, right?\n\n451\n00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.070\nThat's the kinda stuff a hacker\ncan do once they remotely exploit.\n\n452\n00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.630\nAnd the best part about this is, for\n\n453\n00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.790\nthe attacker at least,\nthey didn't have to touch the phone.\n\n454\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:22.150\nBy creating a rogue access point, by using\nDHCP to force the use of their DNS server,\n\n455\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.100\nby using DNS chef to cook DNS results, and\n\n456\n00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:30.120\nby using an attack server,\nthe end user hacked themselves.\n\n457\n00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.800\nThe end user fired up their phone,\nconnected to an access point they\n\n458\n00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.390\nshouldn't have, typed in a web address and\nimmediately got this fake ID.\n\n459\n00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.672\nWe can even go a step further and\ndo what's called a captured portal.\n\n460\n00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:42.920\nYou ever go to a hotel and\nyou connect to their wireless.\n\n461\n00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.900\nAnd no matter what webpage you try and\n\n462\n00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.680\ngo to, it immediately takes\nyou to their login page.\n\n463\n00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.360\nWell in DNS Chef you can do that.\n\n464\n00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.770\nYou can tell it, hey just resolve\neverything to the fake IP.\n\n465\n00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:57.932\nAnd now somebody connects to your access\npoint and no mater what address they type,\n\n466\n00:23:57.932 --> 00:24:00.197\nThey automatically get your attack server.\n\n467\n00:24:00.197 --> 00:24:03.271\nAnd you exploit them,\nyou put in a persistent attack, and\n\n468\n00:24:03.271 --> 00:24:05.927\nthen they go home and\nnow you control that device.\n\n469\n00:24:05.927 --> 00:24:09.002\nThat device is now yours and\nyou never touched it, right?\n\n470\n00:24:09.002 --> 00:24:11.728\nIf this is running automated you may\nhave never even seen the person,\n\n471\n00:24:11.728 --> 00:24:13.374\nmaybe not even have been in the building.\n\n472\n00:24:13.374 --> 00:24:16.372\nAnd they're, meanwhile, phoning home\nto your command and control, and\n\n473\n00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:17.859\nyou've got control of that system.\n\n474\n00:24:17.859 --> 00:24:22.490\nSo that hopefully kinda drives home how\ndangerous it is to have all these devices\n\n475\n00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.197\nout there connecting\nto untrusted networks.\n\n476\n00:24:25.197 --> 00:24:25.790\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\nSo\n\n477\n00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.948\nwhat is our mitigation here when\nwe start talking about this thing?\n\n478\n00:24:29.948 --> 00:24:34.402\nCuz that's pretty scary, that the device\nin my pocket may actually be open to this.\n\n479\n00:24:34.402 --> 00:24:37.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthe mitigation on this one is hard, right?\n\n480\n00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.332\nWe need to only connect to\ntrusted networks, right?\n\n481\n00:24:40.332 --> 00:24:44.013\nWe need to use VPN tunnels and\nencryption whenever possible,\n\n482\n00:24:44.013 --> 00:24:46.081\nwe should be encrypting our data.\n\n483\n00:24:46.081 --> 00:24:48.777\nWe shouldn't allow connections\nto unencrypted servers, right?\n\n484\n00:24:48.777 --> 00:24:49.998\nWe need to make sure that's safe.\n\n485\n00:24:49.998 --> 00:24:54.788\nBut on the DNS side there are actually\ntechnologies out there to help ensure\n\n486\n00:24:54.788 --> 00:24:58.223\nthat we are getting legitimate\nDNS lookups, right?\n\n487\n00:24:58.223 --> 00:25:00.343\nAnd when we do a normal DNS lookup,\n\n488\n00:25:00.343 --> 00:25:05.255\nback in the old day when DNS was created\nthere was really no validation in place.\n\n489\n00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:09.745\nWell, now they do have ways of\nstoring security keys alongside with\n\n490\n00:25:09.745 --> 00:25:14.497\nthe DNS record to verify that you're\ngetting the valid, real record.\n\n491\n00:25:14.497 --> 00:25:18.059\nThe problem is it's not\nthe client that implements that.\n\n492\n00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:20.275\nIt's the domain,\nit's the server side, right?\n\n493\n00:25:20.275 --> 00:25:24.980\nSo as network administrators, what we need\nto do is we need to make sure that anytime\n\n494\n00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.628\nyou bring up a DNS zone,\nthey're using what's called DNSSEC.\n\n495\n00:25:28.628 --> 00:25:34.128\nDNSSEC is where you digitally sign\nevery record inside of a zone file.\n\n496\n00:25:34.128 --> 00:25:38.357\nAnd when clients go to connect to you,\nthey can see that DNSSEC is turned on and\n\n497\n00:25:38.357 --> 00:25:41.694\nthey can validate whether or\nnot that record is legitimate.\n\n498\n00:25:41.694 --> 00:25:44.205\nAnd if we do a hijack and\nwe bring up a rogue DNS server and\n\n499\n00:25:44.205 --> 00:25:48.136\nsomebody does a lookup against it and that\nsignature's not there, then we know it's\n\n500\n00:25:48.136 --> 00:25:52.095\nbeen falsified, we know it's not real data\nand it's pointing us to the wrong place.\n\n501\n00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:55.262\nAnd even if somebody copies the signature\noff of our existing record,\n\n502\n00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:59.083\nthe moment they point it to a different IP\nthe record's broken and it doesn't work.\n\n503\n00:25:59.083 --> 00:26:03.372\nSo DNSSEC so really gonna be\nthe hero on this one to stop this.\n\n504\n00:26:03.372 --> 00:26:08.118\nBut the other side of this Is\npatching your devices, all right?\n\n505\n00:26:08.118 --> 00:26:10.049\nThis exploit,\nthe one that I just showed you?\n\n506\n00:26:10.049 --> 00:26:10.905\nGoogle knows about it.\n\n507\n00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:12.777\nGoogle patched it, they fixed it.\n\n508\n00:26:12.777 --> 00:26:13.926\nAnd they pushed it out and\n\n509\n00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:16.900\nmost of the phones that are out\nthere are already fixed, right?\n\n510\n00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.527\nBut notice how I said most.\n\n511\n00:26:18.527 --> 00:26:23.284\nThis is a valid phone that I can go and\nbuy right now if I want to.\n\n512\n00:26:23.284 --> 00:26:26.325\nAnd they have not pushed out a fix for\nthis.\n\n513\n00:26:26.325 --> 00:26:29.412\nAnd as an end user, what can you do?\n\n514\n00:26:29.412 --> 00:26:31.093\nNothing.\nIn that case they haven't\n\n515\n00:26:31.093 --> 00:26:32.119\npatched your phone.\n\n516\n00:26:32.119 --> 00:26:36.404\nAnd that's why it's so critical that when\nyou're selecting phones for a company,\n\n517\n00:26:36.404 --> 00:26:38.346\nyou pick ones that are being updated.\n\n518\n00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:40.478\nWe make fun of Blackberries, but\n\n519\n00:26:40.478 --> 00:26:44.604\nthey did a great job at keeping\nthe systems updated and patched.\n\n520\n00:26:44.604 --> 00:26:46.161\nApple, whether you like them or not,\n\n521\n00:26:46.161 --> 00:26:49.275\nApple does a great job about not just\nmaking sure their phones get patched but\n\n522\n00:26:49.275 --> 00:26:51.966\nmaking sure their updates\nare available to people immediately.\n\n523\n00:26:51.966 --> 00:26:53.328\nThey bypass the carrier, right?\n\n524\n00:26:53.328 --> 00:26:57.713\nYou don't the wait on AT&amp;T, Apple can\npush an update right to your phone, okay?\n\n525\n00:26:57.713 --> 00:27:01.827\nGoogle is only recently getting into that,\nwhere now you have patches that can be\n\n526\n00:27:01.827 --> 00:27:04.866\ndownloaded monthly to the phones and\nstart to update that.\n\n527\n00:27:04.866 --> 00:27:08.289\nBut there are a lot of Android phones\nthat are out there right now that don't\n\n528\n00:27:08.289 --> 00:27:09.003\nsupport that.\n\n529\n00:27:09.003 --> 00:27:12.274\nSo if you have Android\nphones in your environment,\n\n530\n00:27:12.274 --> 00:27:14.487\nyou've got to be surveying them.\n\n531\n00:27:14.487 --> 00:27:16.762\nYou need tot be using Metasploit\nto scan your network.\n\n532\n00:27:16.762 --> 00:27:19.030\nYou need to be using\nproducts like Nessus and\n\n533\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.771\nother products to scan your network and\nlook for vulnerable phones, and\n\n534\n00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:25.796\nwhen you find them you need\nto decommission those phones.\n\n535\n00:27:25.796 --> 00:27:27.236\nIf there's not an update for them,\n\n536\n00:27:27.236 --> 00:27:29.544\nyou need to get those phones\nout of your network, right?\n\n537\n00:27:29.544 --> 00:27:31.712\nBut if there is an update\nyou need to apply it.\n\n538\n00:27:31.712 --> 00:27:35.952\nKeeping your devices patched, that's how\nyou're gonna avoid this type of attack.\n\n539\n00:27:35.952 --> 00:27:37.478\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, once again,\n\n540\n00:27:37.478 --> 00:27:40.299\na tremendous demonstration\nthere about how easy it is for\n\n541\n00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:44.234\nus to take a look at these mobile devices\nthat we may have inside of our networks,\n\n542\n00:27:44.234 --> 00:27:47.851\nBut you also showed us in this\ndemonstration using simple attack tools.\n\n543\n00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:50.391\nI say simple, complex attack tools, right?\n\n544\n00:27:50.391 --> 00:27:52.360\nMetasploit as well as DNSChef and\n\n545\n00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.664\nthen the Meterpreter to be\nable to carry out the attack,\n\n546\n00:27:55.664 --> 00:28:00.327\nand this is not something that you have\nto set up an entire infrastructure for.\n\n547\n00:28:00.327 --> 00:28:02.223\nSo make sure you review\nthis episode as well.\n\n548\n00:28:02.223 --> 00:28:05.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you again Don for helping us and\n\n549\n00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.984\nthank you also for watching.\n\n550\n00:28:06.984 --> 00:28:10.057\nGreat place for\nus to sign off for ITPRO TV.\n\n551\n00:28:10.057 -->

from\nSan Francisco [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.278 --> 00:00:08.221\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:12.429\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.270\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.490\nYou're watching Emerging Technology\nSecurity Demonstrations.\n\n7\n00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.980\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday you'll be learning about taking\n\n8\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.710\nlook at Trojan Horse Exploits, and here to\nhelp us out is going to be Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.410\nDon, what are we really taking a look\nat when we talk about this idea of\n\n10\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.680\na Trojan Horse Exploit?\n\n11\n00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, if you've been\nwatching all of our episodes, we did\n\n12\n00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.290\nan episode on remotely exploiting a phone\nand via a malicious phishing web site.\n\n13\n00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.968\nSo, we created a false web site, a user\ncan be on their phone, they can try and\n\n14\n00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:42.990\ngo to a legitimate web site.\n\n15\n00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.280\nAnd when they do, they hit a site that\nhas malware rejected, right, an exploit.\n\n16\n00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.200\nAnd by doing that, we were able to\nremotely take control of a phone.\n\n17\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.170\nWell, that was great but it was temporary.\n\n18\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.110\nWe gained temporary access to the phone,\nand it required a lot of infrastructure on\n\n19\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.330\nthe back end to kind of get set up and we\nhad to be physically near to that person.\n\n20\n00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.780\nSo, that type of attack is difficult and\nlimited in utility, right?\n\n21\n00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.650\nIf we want to attack people\nall over the world though, and\n\n22\n00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.580\nif we want that attack to be persistent,\nwhere it stays on the phone even after\n\n23\n00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.940\nwe disconnect,\nthat becomes a little more challenging.\n\n24\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.440\nAnd one of the best ways to pull off that\ntype of attack is with a Trojan Horse.\n\n25\n00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.750\nAnd the name Trojan Horse,\nthat comes from the old,\n\n26\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.770\nI know you guys have all heard the story,\nwas it Roman or Greek?\n\n27\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.280\n&gt;&gt; The Peloponnesian War.\n\n28\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.060\n&gt;&gt; There we go, all right, so\nwe would have got there eventually.\n\n29\n00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.000\nSo, the Roman solders, were they Romans?\n\n30\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.175\n&gt;&gt; They were Greek and Spartans.\n\n31\n00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:39.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm gonna ruin all of this.\n\n32\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.600\nSo anyhow,\nthe soldiers hid inside of a horse, right?\n\n33\n00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.910\nThey delivered it as a gift and they\nthought it was just a big statue gift,\n\n34\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.030\nbut in actuality there was an attack.\n\n35\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.390\nWell, a Trojan Horse inside of\nan application is the same thing.\n\n36\n00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.470\nWe can hide malicious payload right\ninside of a standard application.\n\n37\n00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.750\nAnd if you can somehow trick somebody\ninto installing that application,\n\n38\n00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.750\nthey're installing your\nmalicious payload also.\n\n39\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.910\nAnd any time that application runs,\nyour malicious payload is running and\n\n40\n00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.260\nit's able to do whatever it\nis that you want it to do.\n\n41\n00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.400\nAnd in Android phones and\n\n42\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.350\niOS you can set up applications\nto start when the device starts.\n\n43\n00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.790\nAnd now, anytime the phone boots up\nyour malicious payload is running in\n\n44\n00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.920\nthe background and you effectively have\npersistent access to that device and\n\n45\n00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.300\ncan remotely control it,\nremotely exploit it.\n\n46\n00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.280\nAll right, so, Don, if I'm an attacker and\n\n47\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.740\nI create one of these things,\nhow do I get this on to someone's phone?\n\n48\n00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.070\nI don't think I can just produce\na malicious application and go,\n\n49\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.870\nall right let's put it on Don's phone.\n\n50\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's gonna be\na few steps involved, right?\n\n51\n00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.900\nAnd the highest profile cases of this\n\n52\n00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.420\nusually center around\nuntrusted app stores, right?\n\n53\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.377\nThere are a number of app stores that\nare out there on the internet that are run\n\n54\n00:02:54.377 --> 00:02:56.482\nby mysterious people, right?\n\n55\n00:02:56.482 --> 00:02:58.609\nNot mysterious in that they're aliens or\nanything, but\n\n56\n00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.880\nmysterious in that we just\ndon't know who they are, right?\n\n57\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.724\nThat anybody, you, me, Ronnie, any of us\ncould go and start our own app store and\n\n58\n00:03:06.724 --> 00:03:11.870\nif people chose to trust it then\nthey could install apps from it.\n\n59\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.820\nAnd when you do that you're\ntrusting that whoever's providing\n\n60\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.380\nthat app store's making sure that the apps\nare clean and often times they aren't.\n\n61\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.070\nRight now, I know what you're thinking is,\n\n62\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.090\nhey if I get an Android phone\nI've got the Google Play Store.\n\n63\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.030\nAnd if I get an iPhone I've\ngot the iOS App Store.\n\n64\n00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.970\nAnd Google and Apple both make\nsure that my apps are safe and\n\n65\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.290\nclean and sandbox and protected.\n\n66\n00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.840\nWhy would I ever do anything else?\n\n67\n00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.910\nWell, there's two flaws here.\n\n68\n00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.120\nThe first flaw is there's actually\nlegitimate times where people trust\n\n69\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.260\nother app stores.\n\n70\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.940\nSo for example, Amazon,\nAmazon has an app store for iOS.\n\n71\n00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.640\nThey did it for Kindle originally,\nbut it applies to any Android device.\n\n72\n00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.270\nAnd so it's very common for\n\n73\n00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.020\npeople to set up their phone to be\nable to trust the Amazon App Store.\n\n74\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.010\nWell, unfortunately,\nin the Android world at least,\n\n75\n00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.280\nwe've only got one setting\nthat let's us control that.\n\n76\n00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.130\nLet me show you here\non this Android phone.\n\n77\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.100\nSo this is a standard Android phone,\nI've installed a few apps on it so\n\n78\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.660\nit's not completely stocked.\n\n79\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.480\nBut basically if I know that I want to\nsupport the Amazon App Store, if I go and\n\n80\n00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.690\ntry and download an APK from the internet,\nI'm gonna get a warning that I'm\n\n81\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.550\ninstalling from a third party source,\nand it won't let me do it.\n\n82\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.630\nSo it'll tell me though,\n\n83\n00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.870\nthat if I want to do it, I just need to go\ninto my Settings which I can find here.\n\n84\n00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.060\nAnd in your Settings,\nyou can go down, and under Security,\n\n85\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.210\nwe'll have the option in here for\nUnknown Sources.\n\n86\n00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.130\nThis option right here, Unknown Sources.\n\n87\n00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.810\nNow, when you look at that you're like,\n\n88\n00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.590\nUnknown Sources this is exactly\nwhat Don's talking about.\n\n89\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.480\nI don't want these malicious applications.\n\n90\n00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.080\nBut Amazon, we trust them,\nthey run a clean app store.\n\n91\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.900\nThey test and try and\nverify that all of their apps are clean.\n\n92\n00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.285\nSo, I trust them, but I can't just come\nin and say I'm gonna trust Amazon and\n\n93\n00:04:55.285 --> 00:04:56.380\nnot anybody else.\n\n94\n00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.790\nThis is a global setting, by turning this\non, I now trust pretty much anybody.\n\n95\n00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.680\nIt's kind of a weakness that\nwe have in this ecosystem.\n\n96\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.600\nIf you turn it on,\nyou trust everybody, and that's that.\n\n97\n00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.870\nOn iOS, you kind of have something\nsimilar, but it's with certificates.\n\n98\n00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.730\nIf you download and\ninstall the certificate for\n\n99\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.980\nan untrusted provider, you now trust\nthem and you can install their app.\n\n100\n00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.780\nSo there's way to do\nthis on both platforms.\n\n101\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.630\nOn Android it's just a check mark though,\nso it stands out.\n\n102\n00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.470\nOnce that's enabled, we're trusting\nthe app store to keep things clean.\n\n103\n00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.740\nEven Google and\nApple have had a hard time with that.\n\n104\n00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.130\nThere are examples in both stores where\nmalicious applications have made it\n\n105\n00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.070\nthrough the screening process and\ninto the stores.\n\n106\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.960\nAnd that means that you could\ngo to a trusted store and\n\n107\n00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.450\ndownload the application and\nget infected, right?\n\n108\n00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.970\nSo, through a malicious app store,\nthat's the number one way of doing this.\n\n109\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.120\nBut there's other ways too, if I have\nphysical access to somebody's phone,\n\n110\n00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.390\nI could always just go in and\ninstall the app real quick.\n\n111\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.300\nI could have it on a website and\nbrowse through the website, install it.\n\n112\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.090\nWe did a phishing attack right?\n\n113\n00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.740\nWe did a hijacked web page,\nwe used the rogue access point DNS\n\n114\n00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.220\nin the earlier episode you\ncan use that technique.\n\n115\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.630\nSo somebody comes to the site and\nthey download an app that they\n\n116\n00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.970\nthink is trustworthy and meanwhile your\npayload is hijacked on there, right?\n\n117\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.960\nOr if you do the remote exploit, we did\nin the other episode that the temporary\n\n118\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.870\nattack, once you had temporary control,\nyou can install your app and\n\n119\n00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.590\nnow you've got persistent control.\n\n120\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.440\nYou just went from temporary to permanent\nand now you've got that access, right?\n\n121\n00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.190\nSo, let me show you the process that\nan attacker is gonna take when they do\n\n122\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.390\nthis kind of setup.\n\n123\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.870\nThe first thing that we need to do is we\nneed to build some malicious payload,\n\n124\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.850\nall right.\n\n125\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.940\nAnd the malicious payload\ndoesn't have to be much.\n\n126\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.860\nRemember in the remote exploit episode,\nwhat I did is I had the phone create\n\n127\n00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.522\na tunnel back to me so I could remotely\naccess that phone and control it, right?\n\n128\n00:06:44.522 --> 00:06:49.492\nWell, here I'm gonna make it when the\napplication does that, so I'm not relying\n\n129\n00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:54.118\non a weakness in a browser, I'm not\nrelying on the end user doing anything.\n\n130\n00:06:54.118 --> 00:06:57.978\nJust the moments application launches\nit'll fill the tunnel back to me and\n\n131\n00:06:57.978 --> 00:06:59.270\nI can control the phone.\n\n132\n00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.379\nI'm gonna use Metasploit again,\nto do this,\n\n133\n00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.770\nin Metasploit we have\nthe MSFvenom Utility.\n\n134\n00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.698\nAnd what MSFvenom does is it lets\nus create malicious payloads, and\n\n135\n00:07:10.698 --> 00:07:14.100\nso I can whip one up for\na number of different platforms.\n\n136\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.420\nBut we're gonna be doing Android here so\nI'm gonna come in and\n\n137\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.570\njust say that the platform is Android.\n\n138\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:26.370\nAnd we're using the Meterpreter,\nif I can spell it ME-TER-PRE-TER.\n\n139\n00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.100\nThere we go.\n[LAUGH] Which is the utility that gives me\n\n140\n00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.160\nthe remote tunnel, right?\n\n141\n00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.480\nSo it's gonna be running\non top of Android.\n\n142\n00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.090\nAnd we're using reverse TCP,\nwe're not gonna connect the phone,\n\n143\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.480\ncuz firewalls will block\nthat all over the place.\n\n144\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.110\nWe're gonna make the phone\nconnect back to us.\n\n145\n00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:48.035\nMost firewalls on the entire planet are\nconfigured so that all outbound traffic\n\n146\n00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:52.975\nis allowed, so when the phone tries to\nconnect to me the firewall will allow it.\n\n147\n00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:56.714\nMost firewalls are configured\nto block incoming traffic.\n\n148\n00:07:56.714 --> 00:07:59.712\nSo if I try to connect to\nthe phone that's not gonna work so\n\n149\n00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:02.596\nwe'll do reverse TCP so\nthe phone connects back to us.\n\n150\n00:08:02.596 --> 00:08:06.550\nThe other advantage on that is I don't\nhave to know the IP of the phone, right?\n\n151\n00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.780\nIn my other attack,\nonce I had the tunnel up, well, I guess,\n\n152\n00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.656\nI didn't really need the IP there.\n\n153\n00:08:11.656 --> 00:08:14.183\n[LAUGH] Well,\nwe did the eavesdropping attack and\n\n154\n00:08:14.183 --> 00:08:18.260\nI wanted to intercept traffic from the\nphone, I had to know the IP of the phone.\n\n155\n00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.420\nI had to figure out where that\nphone was on the network.\n\n156\n00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.530\nBut here, they're gonna connect to me so\n\n157\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.150\nI don't really need to know\nanything about the phone.\n\n158\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:26.670\nI do need to tell it my IP address and\n\n159\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.050\nthe information that I'm\ngoing to be connecting from.\n\n160\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.320\nSo, I'm going to setup a server and\nit's gonna be running on this, well,\n\n161\n00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.050\nit's a Linux box in this case, but\n\n162\n00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.950\nit's going to be running here listening\nfor these connections to come in.\n\n163\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.710\nSo, I need to know my IP address, and\n\n164\n00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:46.220\nif this was a local attack you could use\nan internal private address like this one.\n\n165\n00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.900\nBut if you were doing a global attack\nyou'd wanna make sure you had a public IP\n\n166\n00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.290\nand people will normally leverage some\nkind of cloud resource where they can swap\n\n167\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.930\nout IPs pretty easily or redirects or\nwhatever to tie that in.\n\n168\n00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.020\nYou'll see a lot of these are running\ninside of the Thor Cloud, so\n\n169\n00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.030\nthat you can have a endpoint\nin Thor that can't be traced.\n\n170\n00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.170\nAnd it might point to a real node that\nyou control, or you can redirect it,\n\n171\n00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.830\nor whatever.\n\n172\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.990\nThere's a lot of real sophisticated ways\nthat you can hide your command in control\n\n173\n00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.970\nserver, right?\n\n174\n00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.500\nThat's effectively what I'm gonna build\nhere, is this is gonna be a command and\n\n175\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.920\ncontrol server.\n\n176\n00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.500\nThe phone is gonna reach back to me, I can\nthen send them commands to control what\n\n177\n00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.360\nthey do, so\nwe can set up a bot net attack,\n\n178\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.560\nwe can set up all those different things,\nonce their phone is compromised.\n\n179\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.770\nAll right, so I've got the IP address\nof my system that I'm gonna use, and so\n\n180\n00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.460\nI'm gonna come in here and\njust tell it that when it\n\n181\n00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.680\nbuilds this malicious payload, we want\nit to be able to reach out to my server.\n\n182\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.817\nAnd it's the L host or\nthe Listener host and\n\n183\n00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:46.788\nI'm gonna paste in my IP that I just got.\n\n184\n00:09:46.788 --> 00:09:48.859\nThis is a private IP cuz I'm\nin a lab environment, but\n\n185\n00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:51.610\nnormally we'd use a public one,\nbut I'm 10.0.14.254.\n\n186\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:57.120\nAnd then we need to specify a port,\nnow the port can be whatever you want.\n\n187\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.320\nBut know that if you use things\nlike port 80 or port 443,\n\n188\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.650\nthey're more likely to\nget through a firewall,\n\n189\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.830\nthat if you start using weird port\nnumbers they may not pass through.\n\n190\n00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.270\nBut a lot of firewalls do\ndeep packet inspection too.\n\n191\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.290\nSo if you try and piggyback on port 80,\nwell, they might look at it and\n\n192\n00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.360\nsay, wait a minute this is not standard\nHTML traffic, this is something else.\n\n193\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.090\nSo pick an appropriate port for\nyour attack payload.\n\n194\n00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.730\nI'm gonna pick a random one,\nI'll do, well not totally random.\n\n195\n00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.140\nI'm gonna do 8888 cuz\nit's easy to remember.\n\n196\n00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.490\nAll right, so when I press Enter,\nshoot, I forgot a little bit more,\n\n197\n00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.310\nlet me cancel out of that.\n\n198\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.060\nI forgot to tell it exactly how I\nwant it to generate my payload,\n\n199\n00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.260\nnow, when I generate this, right?\n\n200\n00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.000\nSo if I, let me bring this back up.\n\n201\n00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.830\nWhen I generate it I'm specifying the\nlocal host, I'm specifying the local port,\n\n202\n00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.060\nand then I need to tell it a little bit\nabout how I'm generating this payload.\n\n203\n00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.420\nAnd normally what I would do is I\nwould generate source code, right?\n\n204\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.090\nAnd that's kind of what you'll see up here\nwhere it's pulling all these libraries in\n\n205\n00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.410\nand stuff, and\nI just hit CTRL+C to cancel out of that.\n\n206\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.120\nWhat I would do is I would take\na legitimate application right?\n\n207\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.460\nAnd if it was an application that\nI wrote then I could just splice\n\n208\n00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.940\nthis source code right into it and\n\n209\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.260\nnow my malicious payload is in there\nI compile the application and I go.\n\n210\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.020\nOr I could take a legitimate app,\n\n211\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.980\nI mean, you could go to the app store and\ndownload Angry Birds, right?\n\n212\n00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.960\nAnd get the APK for it and\n\n213\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.630\nonce you've got the legitimate\napplication you can decompile it.\n\n214\n00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.675\nIn the Android ecosystem everything\nin java anyway it's pretty easy to\n\n215\n00:11:23.675 --> 00:11:24.310\ndecompile it.\n\n216\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.421\nAnd once it's decompiled then you\ncan splice in your source code, and\n\n217\n00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:29.619\nthen recompile it.\n\n218\n00:11:29.619 --> 00:11:34.020\nNow Android and\niOS both do digitally signed applications.\n\n219\n00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.290\nSo the moment you splice in your code\nyou're going to break the signature of\n\n220\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:42.020\nyour application, and when you recompile\nit, it's not properly signed anymore,\n\n221\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.470\nnobody's gonna trust it.\n\n222\n00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.460\nWell, you can sign it yourself and if for\n\n223\n00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.050\nsome reason people are trusting your\ncertificate, like in iOS where people will\n\n224\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.960\ntrust these other provider's certificates,\nthey'll install it without even a whim.\n\n225\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.150\nThey'll just hit the button and\n\n226\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.310\nthat's that, but\neven if it's an invalid certificate.\n\n227\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.570\nIf they're going to website that's\ndoing things like stolen software,\n\n228\n00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.810\nthis is one of the more common ones.\n\n229\n00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.330\nThis is why we see so many attacks\nthat are happening in Asia right\n\n230\n00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.090\nnow because there are app stores\nall over the place that have,\n\n231\n00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.760\nwhere people download an application\nthat might cost $ 0.99 or $ 5.\n\n232\n00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:22.350\nAnd they decompile it, they remove\nthe paycheck to get that out of there and\n\n233\n00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.670\nthen recompile it with malicious software.\n\n234\n00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.450\nSo you think you're downloading that $ 5\napp for free, hey, I just got this app for\n\n235\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.560\nfree, great.\n\n236\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.020\nMeanwhile, the malicious code is\nrunning in the background now, right?\n\n237\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.260\nAnd when you get an invalid\ncertificate warning, you don't care.\n\n238\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.970\nYou just advance past it because you\nwere trying to get the application for\n\n239\n00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:41.670\nfree anyway, right?\n\n240\n00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.250\nThat's the risk that we have.\n\n241\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:48.300\nWell, the same thing goes for\nif I remotely exploit a device and\n\n242\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.040\nI inject the app I can clear\nthe certificate warning on my\n\n243\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.810\nown without the end\nuser even knowing that.\n\n244\n00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.250\nSo if you have that remote\naccess you can do that.\n\n245\n00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.180\nAll right, but what I need to do because\nI'm, we've only got 30 minutes here so\n\n246\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.510\nI can't write a whole application out and\nsplice this in.\n\n247\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.130\nSo, I'm just gonna\ngenerate the raw pay load.\n\n248\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:08.760\nSo, it's gonna basically create a stand\nalone application with this exploit\n\n249\n00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.140\nsoftware running independently.\n\n250\n00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.910\nSo, that's what I'm gonna do,\nso, I need to fill in that R and\n\n251\n00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.310\nI need to tell it where to send it to.\n\n252\n00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.922\nSo I'm gonna drop that into slash Route,\nslash,\n\n253\n00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:21.300\nwe'll call it customapp.apk, all right.\n\n254\n00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:27.880\nSo that's gonna dump out, and that's gonna\ncreate a malicious application, all right.\n\n255\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:34.330\nNow, look at the size of the application,\n9485 bytes, nine and a half K, right?\n\n256\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.600\nIn under ten kilobytes of traffic,\n\n257\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.500\nI can generate a remote tunnel that\nfully let's me exploit a device.\n\n258\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.420\nThat is very, very small.\n\n259\n00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.190\nYou could take any common application,\nand piggyback this on there, and\n\n260\n00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.480\nit would barely be noticeable, right?\n\n261\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.680\nWell, in the Android App Store,\nin the iOS App Store, they scan for that.\n\n262\n00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.250\nThey look for these types of things that\nhave been piggybacked onto applications,\n\n263\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.820\nthey try and find them.\n\n264\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.707\nBut in a third party app store,\na malicious app store,\n\n265\n00:13:59.707 --> 00:14:00.780\nthat's not gonna be checked.\n\n266\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.590\nOr if we 're manually ejecting it on\na phone it's not gonna be checked and\n\n267\n00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.050\nit'll go completely unnoticed, all right.\n\n268\n00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:12.430\nSo, now all I have to do is take this\n\n269\n00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.405\nAPK that I've written and\nget it installed on a phone.\n\n270\n00:14:17.405 --> 00:14:22.220\nAnd so, I can go to any Android phone\nthat has Unknown Sources checked, right?\n\n271\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.530\nIf I I can always check that option\nmyself and install that application.\n\n272\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:32.480\nOnce that's done, that device should\nstart phoning home back to me so\n\n273\n00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.010\nI can get that information.\n\n274\n00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.080\nWell if it's gonna phone home back to me,\n\n275\n00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.690\nI probably need to have a Listener up and\nrunning.\n\n276\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.420\nSo I need to get the server up and\n\n277\n00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.680\nrunning here that's gonna\nperform my command and control.\n\n278\n00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.370\nSo let me open up another terminal\nhere and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n279\n00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.520\nget that fired up, right?\n\n280\n00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.580\nSo this is going to be my Listener.\n\n281\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.580\nAnd the Listener here is going to be\nthe exact same as the Listener that we\n\n282\n00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:00.670\nused in the hijacking episode because,\nagain, it's just a reverse tunnel.\n\n283\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.640\nThere, we exploited a web browser flaw,\nhere,\n\n284\n00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.640\nit's a malicious application but\nthe end result is basically the same.\n\n285\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:14.805\nSo, I need to come in here, and\nfire up my Msfconsole and, or sorry,\n\n286\n00:15:14.805 --> 00:15:19.840\nMsfconsole, if I spell it right, it'll\nwork better, my Metasploit Framework.\n\n287\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.780\nAnd once that comes up, I'm gonna create\nthe Listener that's gonna sit here waiting\n\n288\n00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.540\nfor these connections to come in.\n\n289\n00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.380\nSo to do that,\nthere's just a couple of commands.\n\n290\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.640\nI need to say we're gonna use\nExploit slash Multi slash Handler.\n\n291\n00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.160\nNow this is different, in the other\nepisode when I did the use exploit,\n\n292\n00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.380\nI specifically put in that it was\ngoing to be Android browser and\n\n293\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.579\nwe were doing a Java interface inject,\nright?\n\n294\n00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:46.050\nThat we were specifically\ntargeting exploit,\n\n295\n00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.140\nhere, the people are connecting to me,\nthey've already been compromised.\n\n296\n00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.280\nI don't have to compromise them,\nthey have already been compromised so\n\n297\n00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.250\nwe just have to wait.\n\n298\n00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.080\nSo this is a Multi Platform Handler,\nwe're just listening and waiting for\n\n299\n00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.392\nthem to connect in.\n\n300\n00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:03.329\nThen,I need to tell it what type\nof connections I'm expecting.\n\n301\n00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:08.839\nSo I'm gonna set my payload and\nit's gonna be\n\n302\n00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:14.062\nandroid/meterpreter/reverse_tcp.\n\n303\n00:16:14.062 --> 00:16:17.890\nRight, so that's the connection\nI'm expecting to come in,\n\n304\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.960\nassuming I spelled it all right.\n\n305\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.200\nIt always pauses here for a second and\nit makes me think I got it wrong, but\n\n306\n00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.710\nnope, I got it right.\n\n307\n00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.470\nAnd then I just need to tell it\nthe IPs that I'm using, right?\n\n308\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:31.050\nSo this particular system is 10.0.14.254.\n\n309\n00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.380\nAnd the port that I'm expecting\nconnections to come in, and\n\n310\n00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.820\nI used 8888, right?\n\n311\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.900\nSo I'll set all that, and\nthen I'll just type exploit.\n\n312\n00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.600\nAnd now my listener's up and running.\n\n313\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.920\nAll right, so now my command and\ncontrol sever is up, and it's waiting for\n\n314\n00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.240\npeople to connect.\n\n315\n00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.240\nI can take the malicious APK\nthat I just crafted, and\n\n316\n00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.810\nwe can install that on any phone,\nas many phones as I want.\n\n317\n00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:00.380\nAnd they'll all start phoning\nhome right to this system.\n\n318\n00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.520\nAnd we can now start lifting their data,\nscraping for\n\n319\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.570\ncredentials, compromising private data,\nwhatever it is that we intend to do.\n\n320\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.700\nSo, the next step is actually getting\nthe application on the phone.\n\n321\n00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.270\nAnd I've already listed several\nways of doing that, right?\n\n322\n00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.330\nMalicious app store,\nwe can throw it on a website,\n\n323\n00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:21.200\nwe can throw it on the various download\nsites like Megauploads or Mega.nz.\n\n324\n00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.390\nWhatever their name is today,\nthrow it on BitTorrents.\n\n325\n00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.100\nAnd people that go out looking for\nfree applications will\n\n326\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.740\nactively download your app and install it,\nnot knowing any better, right?\n\n327\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.710\nThat happens, a lot of people\nare just not educated to know,\n\n328\n00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.670\ndon't get apps from untrusted sources,\nthat happens.\n\n329\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.960\nYou can also try and\nsubmit it to an app store, right?\n\n330\n00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.310\nYou'd be surprised how many times\npeople take a malicious application and\n\n331\n00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:50.080\nthey submit it to Google,\nor they submit it to Apple.\n\n332\n00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.350\nAnd it makes it through, right, there\nhave been several times where militia's\n\n333\n00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.730\napplications have made it\nthrough the initial checks.\n\n334\n00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.980\nAnd then got found out and\ngot pulled afterwards,\n\n335\n00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.550\nafter there were hundreds, thousands,\neven tens of thousands of installs.\n\n336\n00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:08.030\nThere was one a few years back\nin Apple's Asia Store that\n\n337\n00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.320\nhad been installed hundreds of thousands\nof times before it was found out.\n\n338\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.760\nAnd Apple was able to immediately\ninvalidate the signature on that app and\n\n339\n00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.960\nget it yanked back where\nit wouldn't run anymore.\n\n340\n00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.020\nBut usually by that point\nthe damage is already done.\n\n341\n00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.330\nYour data is already compromised.\n\n342\n00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:27.360\nIt doesn't matter that the app's gone,\nsomebody already has your chat history,\n\n343\n00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.440\nor your photos, or whatever,\nthey've already gained that access.\n\n344\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.220\nSo that's the real challenge that you've\ngot, but as another way to distribute out\n\n345\n00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.450\nthe app is you might be able to get\nit into a legitimate app store.\n\n346\n00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.240\nAll right, but in my case,\n\n347\n00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.070\nbecause I've got the phone I\nwanna compromise right here.\n\n348\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:43.100\nI've got physical access to it, I can just\ncopy the APK right over to it and run it.\n\n349\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.320\nAnd we should see it start to\nbuild that connection back.\n\n350\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.980\nSo that's what I'm gonna do next.\n\n351\n00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.830\nSo on my phone, let's say we just went and\ndownloaded the app from a website.\n\n352\n00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:55.650\nWe can fire up any file explorer, go into\nour downloads, and find that application,\n\n353\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.560\nand go to install it.\n\n354\n00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.890\nNow, when I go to install it,\n\n355\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.610\nit's gonna recognize that\nit's from a untrusted source.\n\n356\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.290\nBut it's not complaining about it, because\nI've got untrusted sources turned on.\n\n357\n00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.720\nI'm allowing that right?\n\n358\n00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.720\nBut when I go to install it, it is gonna\nask for some permissions, and boy,\n\n359\n00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.630\nlook at these permissions, right?\n\n360\n00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.430\nWe can directly call phone numbers,\nread your text messages,\n\n361\n00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.510\ntake pictures and video, record audio.\n\n362\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.060\nI mean this is pretty much\nevery permission available.\n\n363\n00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.190\nNow your average end user,\nthey're not even gonna read this, right?\n\n364\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.770\nThey're just gonna hit Install, they don't\nknow what half this stuff is anyway.\n\n365\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.120\nSo if they hit Install, it churns\nalong and installs the application.\n\n366\n00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.410\nNow here it's gonna prompt me whether or\n\n367\n00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:37.200\nnot I want to do Google's\napplication inspection, right?\n\n368\n00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.740\nWhere they actually do malware inspection\nand look for malicious applications.\n\n369\n00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.880\nI'm gonna go ahead and accept that, right?\n\n370\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.680\nWe'll go ahead and say, yeah,\nit's okay for Google to scan my apps.\n\n371\n00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.570\nWell, it didn't catch this one, did it?\n\n372\n00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.670\nNow that happens, sometimes it\nchecks them, sometimes it doesn't.\n\n373\n00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.230\nAnd in this case,\nit didn't catch my application now.\n\n374\n00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:58.280\nIt might catch it later, but\nas of right now it hasn't caught it.\n\n375\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.524\nIt looks like my Callie Linux\nhere kind of fell asleep.\n\n376\n00:20:00.524 --> 00:20:01.648\nI'm gonna wake that one back up,\n\n377\n00:20:01.648 --> 00:20:04.860\ncuz I wanna have this on the screen at the\nsame time that I actually open the app.\n\n378\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.140\nSo it's open now, and\n\n379\n00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.410\nwhat we're going to see is I want\nyou watch in the background, right.\n\n380\n00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:15.140\nWatch back here this is my listener, so\nfor the user, they go to open their app.\n\n381\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.570\nAnd when they open that app, well, I don't\nactually have an app attached, right.\n\n382\n00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.970\nSo normally they would see\nAngry Birds pop up, or Facebook, or\n\n383\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:23.890\nwhatever app they were running.\n\n384\n00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:28.210\nAnd they'd go about it like normal, but in\nthe background, did you see what happened?\n\n385\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.770\nThey opened up a tunnel to me.\n\n386\n00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.690\nAnd now it's just like the other episode,\nwhere we did the DNS hijacking.\n\n387\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:38.370\nHere, they've opened up the tunnel to me,\nand I now have a session and I'm open.\n\n388\n00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.240\nAnd I'm already in my meterpreter,\nand I'm ready to rock, right?\n\n389\n00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:41.760\nAnd from here,\n\n390\n00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.680\nwe have all of the meterpreter\ncommands that we can issue out.\n\n391\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.000\nLike I can turn on their webcam or\nturn on their microphone.\n\n392\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.520\nI can pull their SMS history,\nwe can start to do things like that.\n\n393\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.570\nOr I can drop right to the shell, and\n\n394\n00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:57.810\nonce we're in the shell,\nwe can start navigating their file system.\n\n395\n00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:01.020\nAnd checking out things\nlike their SD card and\n\n396\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.870\naccessing your photos and\ndownloads and other resources.\n\n397\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.200\nAnd getting everything that's\nright there on that system.\n\n398\n00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.050\nSo now they're compromised,\nand this is persistent.\n\n399\n00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.660\nBecause if I would take this phone and\nreboot it,\n\n400\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.460\nthe next time they launch the app,\nit's gonna reach right back out to me.\n\n401\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.280\nAnd they can travel anywhere in the world.\n\n402\n00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.760\nAnd as long as I used a public IP,\nevery time they launch that app,\n\n403\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.320\nit's gonna come back, and\nthey're not going to notice.\n\n404\n00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.280\nCuz if we've piggy backed this on another\napp, that's it, off they go, right?\n\n405\n00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.050\nSo this tunnel is open here in\nthe background, I'm accessing the phone.\n\n406\n00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.400\nMeanwhile on the phone,\nif I were to return to the home screen and\n\n407\n00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.700\nstart to go to use it.\n\n408\n00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.540\nThey don't even know, right,\nif you pull up the app list and\n\n409\n00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:45.380\nwe see apps that are running or something\nin our history it's not even there, right.\n\n410\n00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.430\nIf we had piggyback this on Angry Birds\nfree sample then we would see Angry Birds\n\n411\n00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.120\nhere in the list.\n\n412\n00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.910\nAnd it would be popped up, here it's\ncompletely invisible to the user.\n\n413\n00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.000\nThat's why these types of attacks are so\ndangerous,\n\n414\n00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.460\nright, because it's a trojan horse.\n\n415\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.060\nThey think they're getting one program,\nand in a lot of cases they are.\n\n416\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.160\nThey're getting that program,\n\n417\n00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.110\nbut there's a little hitchhiker\nthat's going along with it.\n\n418\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.510\nAnd that hitchhiker is providing\nremote access to the device.\n\n419\n00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.720\nThat's why that it's so\n\n420\n00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.410\ncritical that we make sure that we only\nhave applications from trusted sources.\n\n421\n00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.450\nAll right Don, so\nis that the only mitigation that we have,\n\n422\n00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.540\nis just making sure that we only\nhave trusted sources and sold?\n\n423\n00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.680\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's a few ways that\nwe can go about this, right?\n\n424\n00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.300\nIf they're corporate managed phones, or\neven if they're bring-your-own device type\n\n425\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.790\ndevices, you can use MDM,\nright, mobile device management.\n\n426\n00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.260\nAnd with MDM,\nyou can create policies that forbid\n\n427\n00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.570\ninstalling applications\nfrom untrusted sources.\n\n428\n00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.610\nYou can say only allow applications\nto be installed from the app stores.\n\n429\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:40.940\nYou can do that, right?\n\n430\n00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:45.920\nYou can also install host-based\nintrusion prevention systems, or HIPS.\n\n431\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.080\nThat's a really complex way of\nsaying anti-virus and anti-malware.\n\n432\n00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.110\nIf you go in your app store like here,\nphone keeps going to sleep,\n\n433\n00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.410\ntrying to save my battery.\n\n434\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.400\nIf you go into your app store,\nthe app store is packed\n\n435\n00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.300\nfull of applications that provide\nanti-virus and anti-malware.\n\n436\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.430\nThere's ones like Avast, and\nSophos is the one that I like,\n\n437\n00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.115\nyeah, and\nI am going to pass on the new keyboard.\n\n438\n00:23:10.115 --> 00:23:11.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's a few other,\n\n439\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.830\nLookout Mobile is another big one.\n\n440\n00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:18.410\nBut Sophos is antivirus security, and you\ncan install it here right on the phone.\n\n441\n00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.170\nAnd now when I install an application,\nit's gonna scan that.\n\n442\n00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.760\nAnd it's gonna see that, but\nit also goes a step further.\n\n443\n00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.500\nSome of these do where they\nhave basic firewalls in place\n\n444\n00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.735\nwhere they can monitor the traffic.\n\n445\n00:23:28.735 --> 00:23:31.870\nAnd when they see me making these\noutgoing tunnels on port 8888 and\n\n446\n00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.640\nit says well that's not normal, right?\n\n447\n00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.610\nAnd it can kind of detect that and\nstop it, Lookout does that and few others.\n\n448\n00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.545\nBut these types of programs\nare not flawless, right?\n\n449\n00:23:43.545 --> 00:23:45.960\nThese programs can be bypassed also.\n\n450\n00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.560\nSo really the best solution\nis by leveraging an MDM, and\n\n451\n00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.750\nmaking sure that people can't install\napplications from untrusted sources.\n\n452\n00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.850\nAnd you control who they trust,\nthat's the benefit.\n\n453\n00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:01.030\nIt can still be their personal phone, they\nstill install things from the app store.\n\n454\n00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.550\nWe just control access for\nthings outside of the app store.\n\n455\n00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.610\nThat's the best way to go about that, and\n\n456\n00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:09.730\nto make sure that your devices stay\nsafe and stay protected, right?\n\n457\n00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:14.290\nThe only other option is\nto control network access.\n\n458\n00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.490\nThat if you have firewalls in place,\nyou can control outbound traffic.\n\n459\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.890\nShould I be able to make outbound\nconnections on port 8888,\n\n460\n00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.180\nmaybe not, right?\n\n461\n00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.740\nAnd we should be able to see that and\ndetect it on the network.\n\n462\n00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.120\nSo host based intrusion prevention systems\nor HIPS, that runs right on the phone.\n\n463\n00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.540\nBut there's network intrusion\nprevention systems.\n\n464\n00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.430\nAnd these are ones that scan\ntraffic in transit, and\n\n465\n00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.920\nthey can locate attack traffic.\n\n466\n00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.420\nOr traffic masquerading as another\nprotocol, and block and protect that.\n\n467\n00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.910\nSo those are all different ways\nthat enterprises can mitigate\n\n468\n00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.562\nthis type of attack.\n\n469\n00:24:43.562 --> 00:24:46.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, well that's\na lot to actually consider when we\n\n470\n00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.760\nstart tackling the idea of unmanaged\ndevices on our networks as well.\n\n471\n00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.690\nRemember that in this episode you did\nlearn about the way that an attacker can\n\n472\n00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.970\nget these types of malicious\napplications onto our phone.\n\n473\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:00.380\nAs well as Don showed you actually\ncreating the app as well and\n\n474\n00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.470\nthen getting access to it too.\n\n475\n00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:03.540\nAnd then, of course,\n\n476\n00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.700\nat the end here Don talked about some\nof the different mitigation factors.\n\n477\n00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.360\nEven though most end users will only\nthink about this idea of trusted\n\n478\n00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.220\nsources to get into.\n\n479\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.340\nDon also mentioned the idea of\nan MDM to help make sure that we,\n\n480\n00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.170\nas network admins, can control what\nalso gets on those phones as well.\n\n481\n00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.690\n&gt;&gt; And actually, Ronnie,\nI know we're ending the show here,\n\n482\n00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.270\nreal quick,\nI just want to demonstrate to you guys.\n\n483\n00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.500\nThat Sophos software that I just\ninstalled, it's doing its first scan, and\n\n484\n00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.160\nit's actually detected my application.\n\n485\n00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.760\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\nyou'll see that scheduled scan is running.\n\n486\n00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.270\nAnd right down here, Threats and PUAs.\n\n487\n00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:39.430\nIt found the custom app APK,\nthat's the APK that I downloaded.\n\n488\n00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.770\nAnd MainActivity, that's the name\nof the installed application.\n\n489\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.270\nSo it's actually found those already and\nit's identifying them.\n\n490\n00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.210\nAnd it's gonna offer to clean them\nas soon as this scan is done.\n\n491\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.870\nSo software like this could have\nprevented the attack that I just did.\n\n492\n00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.040\nGoogle's app scanner didn't catch it,\nSophos did.\n\n493\n00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.580\nSo it shows where defense in depth is so\nimportant.\n\n494\n00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.340\nI just wanted to show you guys that\nreal quick before we wrap the episode.\n\n495\n00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.810\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, well thank you for\n\n496\n00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:06.090\nhelping us see that demonstration\nall the way through.\n\n497\n00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:07.890\nAnd thank you also for watching.\n\n498\n00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.420\nWell that ends this\nparticular demonstration.\n\n499\n00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.760\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n500\n00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.700\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n501\n00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.620\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more emerging\ntechnology security demonstrations.\n\n502\n00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:24.650\n[MUSIC]\n\n503\n00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.613\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
