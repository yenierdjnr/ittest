Don describes some of the problems with them as well as the possible attacks.  He then demonstrates the way built security is working to protect itself on an Apple device by segregating applications and isolatingthe communication between application and the iOS and not allowing direct communication between applications.",

According to Don, this enrollment allows us to create security and management policies for these device that can help secure devices that have company data on them.  He demonstrates not only the enrollment and policy creation but also the actions that can be taken when we discover a device maybe compromised.",
