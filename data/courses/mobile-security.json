[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:07.922\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:11.010\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.486\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:17.660\nyou're watching emergent technology\nsecurity demonstrations.\n\n8\n00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.300\nWe're specifically gonna be diving\ninto the realm of taking look at\n\n9\n00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.200\nexposures that we can get\nfrom unmanaged devices.\n\n10\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.950\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and here to\nhelp us out is gonna be Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.300\nDon, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.236\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:32.309\nAnd yeah,\nin this episode like Ronnie said,\n\n14\n00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.419\nwe're gonna take a look at what it\nmeans to us, as administrators,\n\n15\n00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:38.880\nif we have to deal with a network that\nallows for unmanaged mobile devices.\n\n16\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.279\nAnd, let's start right there with what\nthe heck is an unmanaged mobile device and\n\n17\n00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:44.110\nwe'll kinda get into the risk afterwards.\n\n18\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.695\nWe have this new movement going on\nright now that's called the BYOD or\n\n19\n00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:50.920\nbring your own device movement.\n\n20\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.504\nIn the past, like when I think about it,\nwhen I got out of college,\n\n21\n00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:57.128\ngot my first IT job and\nwent to work for a company,\n\n22\n00:00:57.128 --> 00:01:00.510\nthey issued me a company laptop and\nI had a company desktop.\n\n23\n00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.731\nAnd so, when I was at work I\nused the company desktop and\n\n24\n00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.050\nwhen I was at home I\nused the company laptop.\n\n25\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.290\nAnd then, after a little while I\nwas issued a company cellphone.\n\n26\n00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.400\nAnd, if I may work phone calls\nI use my work cellphone.\n\n27\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.050\nAnd, if I made personal calls,\nI use my personal cellphone if I\n\n28\n00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.070\nhad even one back then I\ndon't think I even have one.\n\n29\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.980\nSo, that's how it was back in the day.\n\n30\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.530\nWell the nice part about that is,\n\n31\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.860\nbecause these were work devices, they were\ncompletely controlled by the company.\n\n32\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.130\nThe company had total control and\n\n33\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.610\nthey could dictate what applications were\nallowed to run, what permissions I had.\n\n34\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.650\nEvery aspect of that device, and\n\n35\n00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.959\nthat device's security was\ndictated by the company.\n\n36\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.080\nBut, over time, right,\nwe had a lot of people wear it like me,\n\n37\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.260\nI used a BlackBerry for ten years,\nI used a BlackBerry and\n\n38\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.360\njust thought it was the greatest thing.\n\n39\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.450\nAnd then the iPhone came out and\nthe iPhone did so\n\n40\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.150\nmuch more than the BlackBerry did.\n\n41\n00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.169\nAnd then, the Android phones came out and\nthey did so\n\n42\n00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:59.404\nmuch more and\nI wanted to switch to one of those, right?\n\n43\n00:01:59.404 --> 00:02:00.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so, I went and bought my own.\n\n44\n00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.730\nI did the first generation iPhone and\nthen the first generation Android phone.\n\n45\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.350\nAnd now, I had these phones that\nI like better than my work phone.\n\n46\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.850\nAnd when I got to the office,\nI didn't wanna use the work phone.\n\n47\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.030\nI wanna use my phone.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.210\n&gt;&gt; Or, maybe I had a laptop\n\n49\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.220\nthat was better than the one they issued\nme for work and I wanted to use my own.\n\n50\n00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.850\nBut I couldn't because at the office,\nthey required us to use the work device,\n\n51\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.670\nright, that ensured security.\n\n52\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.170\nBut that started to change.\n\n53\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.200\nIn the last five to ten years, companies\nhave started saying, wait a minute.\n\n54\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.700\nIf these people wanna buy their own\nphones and they're willing to pay for\n\n55\n00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.460\nit, we could save money.\n\n56\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.700\nWe could let them bring their\nown device and use it for work.\n\n57\n00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.630\nThis is genius.\n\n58\n00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.195\nNow we don't,\nwe don't have to do warranties,\n\n59\n00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:45.810\nwe don't have to do any of that stuff.\n\n60\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.050\nThey pay for it and they're willing\nto do it, and they're happy to do it,\n\n61\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.202\n'cause they get the device they\nwant.That's a, that's a win win, right?\n\n62\n00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:54.400\nCompany says, people get the device\nthey want, that's perfect.\n\n63\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.880\nBut it comes with a risk.\n\n64\n00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.360\nAnd the risk is,\nwhen somebody brings their own device,\n\n65\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.440\nthe company doesn't control it,\nthey can't control what apps are on it.\n\n66\n00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.196\nThey can't control whether it's secure or\nnot, whether it's being updated.\n\n67\n00:03:08.196 --> 00:03:10.070\nThey can't control any of that.\n\n68\n00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.720\nAnd now, you might have people who yeah\nthey're bringing their own device,\n\n69\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.240\nyou save a little money.\n\n70\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.150\nBut, they compromise your network, right?\n\n71\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.000\nWe can really run some big risks by\nallowing these unmanaged devices.\n\n72\n00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.080\nAnd so, when that happens,\nwhat are some of our biggest risks?\n\n73\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.950\nWell, the biggest risk is leaking\nyour corporate data, right.\n\n74\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.892\nAnd nowhere do we see\nthis more than email.\n\n75\n00:03:31.892 --> 00:03:36.331\nAll you have to do is turn on the news to\nfind out that celebrity acts or politician\n\n76\n00:03:36.331 --> 00:03:40.990\nwise had their email compromised and\nsome of these read through all of it.\n\n77\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.785\nThat, if I'm checking my company\nemail on my personal phone, and\n\n78\n00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:49.810\nmy personal phone gets stolen or\ngets lost, and\n\n79\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.560\nit wasn't secured, somebody who finds that\nphone, now has access to all of my email.\n\n80\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.380\nAnd what can the company do about it?\n\n81\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.702\nNothing at that point,\nthe device is already gone, right?\n\n82\n00:03:59.702 --> 00:04:01.930\nThey lost their opportunity to control it.\n\n83\n00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.080\nThat should have been a managed device,\none that the company controlled, but\n\n84\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.140\nit wasn't.\n\n85\n00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.770\nAnd in super critical high secure\nenvironments, it will be a device, right?\n\n86\n00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.890\nThink about the president right,\nwhen President Obama was elected,\n\n87\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.310\nor President Trump,\n\n88\n00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.430\nthe news made a big deal out of both\nof them with their cell phones.\n\n89\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.670\nThey had their personal cell\nphones they really liked.\n\n90\n00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.900\nAnd the government had to switch\nthem to one of the black phones.\n\n91\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.580\nThe secure phones, because just a regular\nconsumer grade phone is not gonna do for\n\n92\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.255\nthe President of the US so,\nthey had to switch to a secure phone.\n\n93\n00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:36.770\nThat is a reality, right, for\na high security environments.\n\n94\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.580\nBut if you're a medium size company,\nor even a large business,\n\n95\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.320\nyou can save a lot of money by having\npeople bring their own devices,\n\n96\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.580\nyou just have to be smart about it.\n\n97\n00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.330\nYou have to secure them, protect them, and\n\n98\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.850\nensure those devices\nare configured in a secure manner.\n\n99\n00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.070\nAnd the best way to do\nthat is to manage them.\n\n100\n00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.750\nNow in the next episode, we're gonna take\na look at actually using what's call\n\n101\n00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.280\nmobile device management,\nallowing us to manage those devices.\n\n102\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.030\nBut before we get in to that, let's talk\na little bit about the security features\n\n103\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.740\nin the phones themselves that are supposed\nto be helping us secure things.\n\n104\n00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.880\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Don, help us out here.\n\n105\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.344\nNow that we've got these types\nof our own unmanaged devices,\n\n106\n00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:14.807\nwhat are some of the attacks that\nwe're really looking out for\n\n107\n00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:17.486\nwhen we're doing this\ninside of our networks?\n\n108\n00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:20.928\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I mentioned not really\nan attack, but a risk a minute ago.\n\n109\n00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:22.560\nI said,\nwhat if somebody loses their phone?\n\n110\n00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.680\nI could find the phone and exploit it or\nget the data out of that phone.\n\n111\n00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.130\nWell, that's not really\na purposeful attack.\n\n112\n00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.330\nThat's a chance occurrence.\n\n113\n00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.390\nI just happened to find a phone, great.\n\n114\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.500\nBut if somebody wants to target your\ncompany and they know that you're using\n\n115\n00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.570\nunmanaged devices, devices that have\nbeen brought in by end users and\n\n116\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.250\nthey're managing themselves then, there's\na ton of attacks that are available.\n\n117\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.220\nThey can target them through a number of\nthings like Rouge App Stores and push\n\n118\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.440\nTrojan Horses and malware and things like\nthat onto a phone to start tracking and\n\n119\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.500\nleaking data out of that device.\n\n120\n00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.730\nA remote exploit is probably\none of the biggest risks.\n\n121\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.224\nWe'll see in another\ndemonstration coming up.\n\n122\n00:06:00.224 --> 00:06:04.624\nWe've got jailbreaking end users\nwill sometimes intentionally\n\n123\n00:06:04.624 --> 00:06:09.090\nmake their phones less secure,\nright, take an iOS device.\n\n124\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.080\nWhen you buy an iPhone or an iPad, an iOS\ndevice, it can only run applications\n\n125\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.600\npulled from the Apple App Store,\nfrom the iTunes App Store, or whatever.\n\n126\n00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.430\nOr, applications that have been digitally\nsigned by a trusted company, so\n\n127\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.310\na company can push their own applications\nwithout going through the app store.\n\n128\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.071\nBut everything else has come to the app\nstore unless the user jailbreaks\n\n129\n00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:31.830\ntheir phone.\n\n130\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.940\nIf they jailbreak it,\nnow they can install apps from anywhere.\n\n131\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.360\nAnd maybe they wanna run things\nlike video game emulators.\n\n132\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.360\nYou can't run those on an iPhone normally.\n\n133\n00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.220\nBut you can pull them from these\nalternative app stores if you jailbreak.\n\n134\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.980\nAnd the risk there is, when you jailbreak,\nyou're weakening the security of the phone\n\n135\n00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.860\nand that can be taken advantage of very,\nvery easily.\n\n136\n00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.630\nThat's something we just can't\nallow in a corporate environment,\n\n137\n00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.910\nweaken security too much.\n\n138\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.420\nSurveillance, if an attacker gets\nphysical access to a phone, even for\n\n139\n00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.270\na moment ,there's a number of different\nexploits they can apply to the phone,\n\n140\n00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.370\nto set it up for\nremote surveillance, right?\n\n141\n00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.142\nAnd I'll show it in an episode later\non here, where we take a phone and\n\n142\n00:07:11.142 --> 00:07:15.686\nwe remotely exploit it,\nwe inject a malware into it via webpage.\n\n143\n00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:18.878\nAnd once that's done, we can open up\na session, and do things like turn on\n\n144\n00:07:18.878 --> 00:07:22.520\nthe microphone, and listen to what's\ngoing on on that phone, in that area.\n\n145\n00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.140\nWe can record what's on the camera,\nwe can send text messages from that phone.\n\n146\n00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.075\nYou can do all sorts of things, remotely.\n\n147\n00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:31.715\nAnd from a surveillance perspective,\nit's perfect\n\n148\n00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:35.455\nbecause you've got a GPS on the phone,\nso you can track where people are going.\n\n149\n00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:36.775\nYou've got a microphone,\nyou've got a camera.\n\n150\n00:07:36.775 --> 00:07:39.645\nSo now, you've got eyes and\nears on the person.\n\n151\n00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:44.085\nYou know exactly where they are,\nall because that phone got exploited.\n\n152\n00:07:44.085 --> 00:07:45.177\nWe definitely don't want that.\n\n153\n00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:48.896\nYou might have security personnel that\nmonitor your physical building, and\n\n154\n00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:52.670\nif they're bringing their own device and\nthose device is being compromised,\n\n155\n00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.272\nnow someone could determine where\nthe security guards or in a given time and\n\n156\n00:07:56.272 --> 00:07:58.929\nuse that as part of a physical\nbreak in unto a facility.\n\n157\n00:07:58.929 --> 00:08:01.046\nThose are things that\naren't just possible,\n\n158\n00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:03.551\nthese are things that have\nalready happened, right?\n\n159\n00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:05.730\nThere are documented cases\nof these events occurring.\n\n160\n00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.308\nSo definitely something\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n161\n00:08:08.308 --> 00:08:10.682\nAnd then lastly, data tampering.\n\n162\n00:08:10.682 --> 00:08:13.306\nThat if somebody has access\nto your information,\n\n163\n00:08:13.306 --> 00:08:16.685\nif they can get into the phone's data,\nthey can tamper with it.\n\n164\n00:08:16.685 --> 00:08:20.695\nA Trojan horse is an example\nwhere we modify an application to\n\n165\n00:08:20.695 --> 00:08:25.495\nthen phone home back to us and\nsend information, leak data, whatever,\n\n166\n00:08:25.495 --> 00:08:30.560\nthat we can tamper with the applications\non a phone or just our regular data.\n\n167\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.650\nI might be having email records or other\nfiles and folders stored on my phone.\n\n168\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.800\nWe can start to modify those records.\n\n169\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.320\nThese are all risks that we have when\na phone is not properly secured and\n\n170\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.243\neven a heavily secured phone\ncan be risked to some of this,\n\n171\n00:08:42.243 --> 00:08:43.867\nif it's not secured properly.\n\n172\n00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:45.643\nWe have to keep it patched and updated and\n\n173\n00:08:45.643 --> 00:08:48.946\nall the things that we know we're\nsupposed to do but a lot of people don't.\n\n174\n00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:49.566\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don,\n\n175\n00:08:49.566 --> 00:08:53.690\nyou make it sound fairly dangerous to\nactually have an unmanaged device.\n\n176\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.500\nBut don't the devices themselves have\nsome form of security that we can use?\n\n177\n00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.450\n&gt;&gt; They do, right?\n\n178\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.180\nSo phones actually do a lot\nto secure themselves.\n\n179\n00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.157\nBut in a unmanaged device, right, so if I\ngo to the store and I buy my own phone,\n\n180\n00:09:05.157 --> 00:09:06.019\nI now manage it.\n\n181\n00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:08.250\nNot my company, I do.\n\n182\n00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.720\nAnd as the end user, I can start to\nturn off those protections, right?\n\n183\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.566\nThink about a lock screen.\n\n184\n00:09:14.566 --> 00:09:19.978\nIf I wanna unlock my phone, most phones\nhave a method of doing this, right?\n\n185\n00:09:19.978 --> 00:09:22.276\nAnd it could be as simple as\nnot having a lock screen.\n\n186\n00:09:22.276 --> 00:09:25.292\nYou push the power button and\nyou're phone is on and now you're in and\n\n187\n00:09:25.292 --> 00:09:26.184\noff you go, right?\n\n188\n00:09:26.184 --> 00:09:28.912\nOr maybe it's a number pad, right?\n\n189\n00:09:28.912 --> 00:09:33.653\nSo you turn the phone on and you've gotta\npunch in a code to be able to get in or\n\n190\n00:09:33.653 --> 00:09:35.840\ndraw a pattern, to get in.\n\n191\n00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.450\nOr maybe it's a finger print scanner,\na little more advanced, right?\n\n192\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.680\nThat's what I use on my phone.\n\n193\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.550\nSo if I turn my phone on I've gotta\nuse my finger print to unlock it.\n\n194\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.950\nThat really helps secure it.\n\n195\n00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.650\nIf I lose my phone, I leave it in a cab\nsomewhere, somebody else could find it but\n\n196\n00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.830\nunless they have my code,\nthey're not gonna get at my data?\n\n197\n00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.980\nSo that's safe but if it's my phone,\nI can turn that off.\n\n198\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.190\nI can turn the finger print scanner off.\n\n199\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.070\nI can turn the number code lock off,\npattern lock, whatever it is.\n\n200\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.190\nAnd in fact,\nthey're usually off by default.\n\n201\n00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.130\nSo phones take steps,\nthey take precautions but\n\n202\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.330\na lot of times users don't\ntake advantage of them.\n\n203\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.520\nAnd that's where managing\nthe devices comes in.\n\n204\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.820\nBecause a company can come\nin with a manage policy and\n\n205\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.600\nthey can say look, your phone has to\nhave a lock screen, it's required.\n\n206\n00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.680\nAnd it has to use either a finger print or\n\n207\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.270\na six digit PIN, not a four digit,\na six digit, right?\n\n208\n00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.525\nYou can dictate policies like that and\nyour phone has to be encrypted.\n\n209\n00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:34.200\nAnd you know that almost every phone sold\ntoday supports encrypting the file system.\n\n210\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.060\nBut most of them don't\ndo it out of the box.\n\n211\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.550\nAnd the reason they don't is for\nperformance.\n\n212\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.410\nThey want the phone to run fast so\nwhen the user buys it at the store,\n\n213\n00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:46.030\nthey see this snappy new fancy phone\nthat runs nice and fast but if they turn\n\n214\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.170\non encryption, it's more secured which\nruns a little bit slower, right?\n\n215\n00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.920\nWell for a regular end user,\n\n216\n00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.820\nthey might not care about encryption, they\nmight not care, they want it to go fast.\n\n217\n00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.380\nVersus a company which'll say, hey,\n\n218\n00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.280\nwe'll gladly sacrifice\na little speed to encrypt it.\n\n219\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.222\nNow that's rapidly changing.\n\n220\n00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:02.510\nThe newest iPhones are all\nencrypted by default.\n\n221\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.140\nSo that's a new kind of thing\nthat's come out in the last year.\n\n222\n00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.030\nWe're starting to see Android\nphones that are doing the same.\n\n223\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:12.530\nBut it's a rare Android phone that\nencrypts the SD card by default.\n\n224\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.690\nIn fact many of them don't even support\nencrypting the SD card which is a shame.\n\n225\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.600\nSo there are areas where things\ncan still be weakened and\n\n226\n00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.440\nmaybe weaken their basic configuration,\nright?\n\n227\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.620\nBut there's other things that phones\ndo to try and help protect us, right?\n\n228\n00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.800\nAnd the main example I want to give of\nthat is sandboxing, that when you buy\n\n229\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.102\nan Android phone, or an iOS phone,\nthey both implement a sandboxing system.\n\n230\n00:11:35.102 --> 00:11:39.020\nAnd sandboxes are ways of\nisolating applications,\n\n231\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.570\ncreating fences in between applications.\n\n232\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.320\nSo if I run one program, and\nmaybe it's my email program,\n\n233\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.060\nit's got all my email in it.\n\n234\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.620\nAnd then I run another malicious program,\nmaybe least somehow I managed to get\n\n235\n00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.000\na malware program installed,\nthat by default, iOS and\n\n236\n00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.450\nAndroid will not allow the malware\nprogram to access my email.\n\n237\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.760\nAnd it won't be able to come over and gain\naccess to that data, they're isolated,\n\n238\n00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.510\nthey're in their own\nseparate little worlds.\n\n239\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.530\nBut it's not a perfect system because\n\n240\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.600\nwe need applications to be able\nto talk to each other, right?\n\n241\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.540\nFor example,\nmaybe Ronnie emails me a PDF, okay?\n\n242\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.260\nSo, I fire up my email program and\nI see, Ronnie sent me an email and\n\n243\n00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.870\nhere's this attachment, it's a PDF.\n\n244\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.290\nI need to open in my PDF reader.\n\n245\n00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:28.990\nWell, now I need my email client to be\nable to talk to my PDF reader, don't I?\n\n246\n00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.680\nI need those applications to talk so\nthat I can open that up.\n\n247\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.800\nAnd the vendors have found kind of some\ncreative ways to do that securely.\n\n248\n00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.800\nAnd one of the best examples is\nhow Apple handled it with iOS.\n\n249\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.660\nThey do a great job of\nsecurely controlling access\n\n250\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.180\nin between the applications.\n\n251\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:49.660\nSo every program runs in its own little\nisolated area and then there's very,\n\n252\n00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.370\nvery limited access, technically there's\nno access alowed between the applications.\n\n253\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.880\nLet me show you, it's probably easier for\nme to show it than to just talk about it.\n\n254\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.840\nI'm gonna connect into an iOS\ndevice here real quick.\n\n255\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.800\nAnd what I'm doing is instead of using the\nfancy graphical user interface that most\n\n256\n00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.310\npeople are used to,\nI'm going in to the actual shell so\n\n257\n00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.170\nthe actual back end of\nthe operating system on this phone.\n\n258\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.990\nAnd I want to show you guys\nhow applications are stored.\n\n259\n00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.616\nNow, in order to gain this type of access,\nI had to jailbreak the phone.\n\n260\n00:13:22.616 --> 00:13:25.734\nNormally, you don't have access\nto the backend file system.\n\n261\n00:13:25.734 --> 00:13:29.415\nYou can't gain root access,\nlike you see I'm logged in here as root.\n\n262\n00:13:29.415 --> 00:13:31.234\nNormally you wouldn't have that ability.\n\n263\n00:13:31.234 --> 00:13:34.142\nSo, I had to jailbreak the phone to do it.\n\n264\n00:13:34.142 --> 00:13:36.420\nBut it's my device, so\nI did it, I just jailbreak.\n\n265\n00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.210\nIt's easy, right?\n\n266\n00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.310\nBut in a corporate environment,\nthis is bad.\n\n267\n00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.440\nBecause the access that I now have is the\naccess an attacker would have if they got\n\n268\n00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.720\na hold of this device.\n\n269\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.510\nOr if I configure it incorrectly,\n\n270\n00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.610\nthey might even be able to get\nthis access over the network.\n\n271\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.990\nI am doing SSH over the network here and\nthere's no reason somebody else couldn't\n\n272\n00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.820\ndo it either and so\nnow they might have access.\n\n273\n00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.060\nThere could be other people logging into\nthis iPad right now without me knowing it.\n\n274\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.641\nHopefully not.\n\n275\n00:13:59.641 --> 00:14:01.451\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n276\n00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:04.167\n&gt;&gt; All right, so here I am in this iPad\n\n277\n00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:10.472\nand I'm in a folder, /var/root, which\nis just the folder for the root user.\n\n278\n00:14:10.472 --> 00:14:12.730\nIt's kinda like the root\nuser's home directory.\n\n279\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.160\nWell applications on an iPad and iPads and\niPhones run the same operating system.\n\n280\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.232\nThey run the iOS,\nthe Apple iPhone operating system.\n\n281\n00:14:21.232 --> 00:14:24.000\nEven though it's an iPad, it runs the iOS.\n\n282\n00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.780\nSo, they run the same iOS and on the iOS,\n\n283\n00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.780\nyou have a root user\nwhich is the super user.\n\n284\n00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.190\nAnd technically you should never have\naccess to it like what I have right here.\n\n285\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.510\nAll the applications actually\nrun as another user.\n\n286\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.187\nThey run as a user called mobile and\nso every program is running as\n\n287\n00:14:40.187 --> 00:14:43.740\na non-super user, so\na user that doesn't have root access.\n\n288\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.304\nSo that's security protection number one.\n\n289\n00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:51.540\nAnd then number two, they each have\ntheir own isolated little environments.\n\n290\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.920\nIf I browse around on this file system,\nI can see a couple of different things.\n\n291\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.252\nSo I'm in /var/ root.\n\n292\n00:14:57.252 --> 00:15:01.700\nIf I go into /var/mobile,\nthat's the folder for\n\n293\n00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.673\nthe mobile user and\nits Home folder and its Information.\n\n294\n00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:09.787\nAnd so if I take a look in there,\nI'll see Containers,\n\n295\n00:15:09.787 --> 00:15:12.853\nDownloads, Media,\nDocuments, Library, right?\n\n296\n00:15:12.853 --> 00:15:17.200\nThese are all files and things that\npertain to that user, the mobile user.\n\n297\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.928\nSo when you pickup an iPhone, a brand new\niPhone and you sign in with your Apple ID\n\n298\n00:15:20.928 --> 00:15:24.282\nand all that, you're actually logging\nin as this user called mobile.\n\n299\n00:15:24.282 --> 00:15:27.037\nEven though you have your own Apple ID,\neverybody's using the same user.\n\n300\n00:15:27.037 --> 00:15:30.438\nBut it's not like where it has the same\npassword across all the devices,\n\n301\n00:15:30.438 --> 00:15:34.390\nevery device kind of leverages\nits own credentials like that.\n\n302\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.957\nNow this mobile user exists\ninside of the sandbox.\n\n303\n00:15:38.957 --> 00:15:43.130\nAnd the sandbox has three kind of\ncontainers that are inside of it.\n\n304\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.816\nAll right, one container is\nthe application container.\n\n305\n00:15:45.816 --> 00:15:48.545\nThat's where the applications\nactually reside and\n\n306\n00:15:48.545 --> 00:15:51.407\nthe apps are stored in\na different folder altogether.\n\n307\n00:15:51.407 --> 00:15:53.456\nI'll show you that one\nhere in just a moment.\n\n308\n00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:58.073\nThen we have the data container and\nwhat I'm looking at right here is actually\n\n309\n00:15:58.073 --> 00:16:03.440\nthe data container where I see documents,\nand library, containers, downloads.\n\n310\n00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.625\nThis is the data container.\n\n311\n00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:07.649\nAnd inside of the data container,\nthere will be individual containers for\n\n312\n00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:09.530\neach application we'll\nsee in just a moment.\n\n313\n00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.100\nAnd then lastly there's\nthe iCloud container.\n\n314\n00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.510\nNow I can't show you the iCloud container\ncuz that's a completely protected system\n\n315\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.640\nthat's synchronized with Apple's iCloud.\n\n316\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.570\nBut iCloud has its own storage,\nand it's completely protected so\n\n317\n00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.370\nthat you can't modify it without passing\nthrough the iCloud APIs to do it.\n\n318\n00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.130\nSo I don't see it represented\nhere in the file system.\n\n319\n00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.990\nAll right.\n\n320\n00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:35.120\nBut, what I am seeing is user data\nthat pertains to this particular user.\n\n321\n00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.250\nNow, when I install an application,\nit's really important\n\n322\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.140\nthat applications don't get modified,\nthat they don't get tampered with.\n\n323\n00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.290\nSo Apple does two things.\n\n324\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.780\nFirst, they put it in protected storage.\n\n325\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:51.690\nThe applications are actually\nstored in /var/containers/,\n\n326\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.140\nall right, so the applications are stored\nin the separate folder outside of\n\n327\n00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.270\nthe mobile user.\n\n328\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.300\nSo the mobile user does not have\nwrite permission to this folder.\n\n329\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.340\nThey can't change the files.\n\n330\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.630\nWhen you install an application, it's the\nIOS on the back end that's installing it,\n\n331\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.754\nand then the mobile user just has\nread access to that application.\n\n332\n00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:11.520\nSo they can't tamper with\nan application once it's in there.\n\n333\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.570\nAnd even if they could,\nthe applications are digitally signed.\n\n334\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.870\nAnd so, when we come in here, and\nI'm gonna switch into the Bundle folder.\n\n335\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:24.850\nSo now I'm in /var/container/Bundle,\nand I take a look inside of here.\n\n336\n00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.050\nActually, I think there\nwas one more folder.\n\n337\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.800\nYep, I need to get into Application.\n\n338\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.560\nThere we go.\n\n339\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.420\nSo /var/container/Bundle/Application,\nand when I look in here,\n\n340\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.820\nI'm going to see really long folder names,\nright?\n\n341\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.140\nAnd what these are are GUIDs, right?\n\n342\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.220\nGlobal Unique Identifiers.\n\n343\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.220\nEach application gets its own GUID.\n\n344\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.800\nAnd they need that because they're\nall going to be digitally signed.\n\n345\n00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.459\nThey have a digital signature\napplied to each application.\n\n346\n00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:54.061\nAnd where it gets really interesting is if\nRonnie installs an app on his phone and\n\n347\n00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:57.071\nI install the app on my phone,\nthey'll have different GUIDs, and\n\n348\n00:17:57.071 --> 00:17:58.955\nthey'll have different signatures, so\n\n349\n00:17:58.955 --> 00:18:02.810\nwe can't kinda piggy back off of each\nother as we tamper with these things.\n\n350\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.380\nSo, if I tamper with one of my devices,\nthe digital signature fails, or\n\n351\n00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.610\nif I tamper with the application\nitself the signature fails.\n\n352\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.180\nAnd we'll know it's a compromised\napplication, right, so\n\n353\n00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.150\nit won't be allowed to run.\n\n354\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.599\nBut if I take a look at these folders,\n\n355\n00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:19.463\nI'm just gonna use the date\nhere to figure out.\n\n356\n00:18:19.463 --> 00:18:20.820\nI installed Pokemon Go.\n\n357\n00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.097\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be my test app for\n\n358\n00:18:22.097 --> 00:18:22.750\nthis show here.\n\n359\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.390\nIt's fairly popular right now.\n\n360\n00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.710\nSo, I installed it on April 2nd.\n\n361\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.890\nI'm gonna switch into that folder.\n\n362\n00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:35.490\nAnd inside of that folder, we're going to\nsee, there it is, pokemongo.app, right?\n\n363\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.960\nAnd when I look at that file,\npokemongo.app, it's 1.5 kilobytes in size,\n\n364\n00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.310\nwell, that's because this is a directory,\nright?\n\n365\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.150\nThe bundled application is\nactually stored in a directory.\n\n366\n00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.435\nAnd then if I go inside of it,\nI'll see the data inside.\n\n367\n00:18:49.435 --> 00:18:54.220\nBut pokemongo.app,\nthat's the actual application right here.\n\n368\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:19:00.370\nAnd if I get into its folder,\nwhich I can do like this, there we go.\n\n369\n00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.320\nNow I'm actually seeing\nthe graphics assets for\n\n370\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.780\nthat file and the true application,\nwhich is down there at the bottom.\n\n371\n00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.280\nSee Pokemon Go, 54 megabytes?\n\n372\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.000\nThat's the actual application.\n\n373\n00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.820\nAnd the user and group that owns it,\nthe install daemon, right.\n\n374\n00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.130\nSo _installD.\n\n375\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:17.930\nThat's the install daemon.\n\n376\n00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.870\nIt's a service that runs\nin the background, and\n\n377\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:24.070\nit's what actually did the installation,\nand it's what controls access to it.\n\n378\n00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:29.650\nBut if you look at the Unix permissions\non the side, you've got RWX, RXRX.\n\n379\n00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.790\nThat means the owner,\ninstallD has read, write and execute.\n\n380\n00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.610\nThe group which is installD has read,\nwrite, and execute.\n\n381\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.900\nAnd everyone else has read and execute.\n\n382\n00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.840\nSo regular users can\nlaunch the application,\n\n383\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.730\nbut they can't modify it right,\nso that's important.\n\n384\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.150\nAnd even if they could modify it,\nit would damage the signature.\n\n385\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:52.370\nSo this is the application container, the\napplication is isolated right over here.\n\n386\n00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:58.430\nIf I switch back to /var/mobile and\n\n387\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:03.700\nget back here, this is the user, and\nif I get into the containers folder\n\n388\n00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.580\nright in here,\nI'm gonna see data and shared, okay.\n\n389\n00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.750\nThere's two different folders here for\ndata for applications.\n\n390\n00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.930\nThe data folder is isolated for\neach individual application,\n\n391\n00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:22.034\nshared is the data that is allowed to\nbe exchanged between applications.\n\n392\n00:20:22.034 --> 00:20:25.930\nAnd on most iOS devices you'll find\nwhere shared is completely empty.\n\n393\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.673\nThat there is very,\n\n394\n00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:29.220\nvery little data that's allowed\nto be shared between application.\n\n395\n00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.020\nSo for the most part,\nyou're gonna not see much in there.\n\n396\n00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.895\nIt's usually like game center junk\nthat we don't care about anyway.\n\n397\n00:20:34.895 --> 00:20:42.030\nBut if we go into data, into here, now we\ncan start to get into our data containers.\n\n398\n00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.730\nAnd there's an application folder in here,\njust like before.\n\n399\n00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.120\nI always forget that application folder.\n\n400\n00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.950\nAnd let me get into it.\n\n401\n00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:54.070\nAnd what we're going to see in\nhere is another giant list of\n\n402\n00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.260\nGUIDs basically that are coming up for\nall these applications.\n\n403\n00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.800\nLet me just try and\nclean that up a little bit more.\n\n404\n00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.900\nThere we go.\nAnd so\n\n405\n00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.370\nI'll see a ton of applications that\nare all being listed right here.\n\n406\n00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.780\nAnd as I look in my list,\nI'll see April 2nd, this guy, and\n\n407\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.570\nthat's gonna be the Pokemon GO, again,\nthat I installed just the other day.\n\n408\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.670\nSo I'm gonna copy that GUID so\nI can get at it.\n\n409\n00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.838\nAnd then we'll change into that directory.\n\n410\n00:21:19.784 --> 00:21:21.810\nAnd take a look at what's in there, right?\n\n411\n00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.060\nAnd as I look in there I'll see there\nis a document folder, a library folder,\n\n412\n00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.170\na store kit folder.\n\n413\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.200\nThe most important one for\nme is gonna be this documents folder.\n\n414\n00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.774\nAnd inside of the documents folder,\n\n415\n00:21:30.774 --> 00:21:36.940\nif I can spell it right, [LAUGH]\nInside this documents I see nothing.\n\n416\n00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.670\nI see nothing cuz I've\nnever actually run the app.\n\n417\n00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.010\nI installed but I didn't run it.\n\n418\n00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.570\nSo it hasn't generated any documents.\n\n419\n00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:47.320\nBut what you're gonna find in here is that\nthe application will store its files,\n\n420\n00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.140\nits information,\nits preferences will be stored in here.\n\n421\n00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.220\nAnd they'll be isolated\nfrom other applications.\n\n422\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.230\nLet me just pick another\napplication here and\n\n423\n00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:02.110\nlet's see if we can find somebody a little\nmore interesting than old Pokemon Go.\n\n424\n00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.270\nBut they'll store their\ninformation in here.\n\n425\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.270\nAnother one I haven't run.\n\n426\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.680\nThis is the, the biggest challenge we have\nis that there are so many applications in\n\n427\n00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.510\nthe list and they have all got this\nkind of GUID names attached to them.\n\n428\n00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.470\nSo it's hard to tell what is what.\n\n429\n00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.000\nBut basically, they are gonna store their\ninformation right there in that documents\n\n430\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.030\nfolder, and that's gonna\nisolate them from anybody else.\n\n431\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.810\nSo if I have an email client and\n\n432\n00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:29.740\nI download a attachment, that attachment\nis gonna go in that Documents folder.\n\n433\n00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:34.820\nAnd once it's in the Documents folder,\nwell it's just gonna sit there and\n\n434\n00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.710\nthe email client will be able to see it,\nbut that's it.\n\n435\n00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.480\nNobody else will be able to see it.\n\n436\n00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.680\nIt's just gonna sit there and\nit's isolated.\n\n437\n00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.240\nSo what you'll see is Apple came\nup with an innovative way to allow\n\n438\n00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.715\nus to share applications between devices.\n\n439\n00:22:49.715 --> 00:22:54.440\nWhat they said was that instead of\nallowing one application to talk to\n\n440\n00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.410\nanother application, we're gonna gate\neverything through a share window.\n\n441\n00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.940\nAnd the share window works on\na really interesting principle.\n\n442\n00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.630\nIt says that the application is not\nallowed to talk to another application,\n\n443\n00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.610\nbut it can talk to iOS.\n\n444\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.330\nAnd when it talks to iOS, it can say I\nwanna share this with another program.\n\n445\n00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.858\nAnd iOS can make a decision,\ndo I wanna allow this or not.\n\n446\n00:23:14.858 --> 00:23:19.290\nThat gives Apple the chance to gauge\nwhether this is okay behavior or not.\n\n447\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.940\nAnd if it's okay behavior,\nit will say,okay give\n\n448\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.720\nme the file snd I'll take the file and\nI'll drop it off where it needs to go.\n\n449\n00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.571\nSo for example, if we were sharing\nsomething and it needed to be sent to\n\n450\n00:23:30.571 --> 00:23:34.881\na screen reader or something like that,\nwhat you would find is in the documents\n\n451\n00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:39.256\nfolder, so if were to get back into the\ndocuments folder of some application and\n\n452\n00:23:39.256 --> 00:23:42.480\ntake around, there's another empty one.\n\n453\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.810\nWhat you'd find in here is\nas sub folder called inbox.\n\n454\n00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.380\nAnd that inbox folder is where\nIOS would take the attachment and\n\n455\n00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.070\ndrop it off into the inbox.\n\n456\n00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.250\nAnd now that other application would\nsee this new incoming file and\n\n457\n00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.226\nbe able to act on it.\n\n458\n00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:57.549\nNow notice what happens there,\n\n459\n00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:59.860\nthe two applications never\ntalk to each other, right?\n\n460\n00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.780\nThey don't talk to each other at all.\n\n461\n00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:06.890\nThey talk to iOS and iOS takes that file\nand drops off in the other application.\n\n462\n00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.540\nSo you've always got this\nGatekeeper in between and\n\n463\n00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.470\nthat what preserves the Sandbox.\n\n464\n00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:17.330\nIf one application is fully compromised,\nit's no big deal cuz it can't talk to\n\n465\n00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.590\nany other application, it's isolated,\nprotected, and separated.\n\n466\n00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.550\nAnd when you jailbreak a phone,\nyou break that.\n\n467\n00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.330\nYou tear down those walls.\n\n468\n00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.840\nNotice how I'm just moving\nin-between these folders from\n\n469\n00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.750\napplication to application.\n\n470\n00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.500\nI can touch all of these folders.\n\n471\n00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.470\nAnd that's because this\ndevice is jailbroken.\n\n472\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.500\nThat means the walls,\nthe walled garden that they call it.\n\n473\n00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.230\nThose walls are gone on mine.\n\n474\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.190\nAnd that makes it where I can\ndo a heck of a lot more on\n\n475\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.000\nthis iPad than a normal iPad.\n\n476\n00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.410\nBut it means that my iPad is far\nless secure than a normal iPad.\n\n477\n00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:50.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, I know you really\nwant to get into showing us Android,\n\n478\n00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.300\nbut let's go back to the share\ndialogue thing a little bit, and\n\n479\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.000\ncan you show us a little bit about it.\n\n480\n00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.750\n&gt;&gt; I didn't think about that, Ronnie.\n\n481\n00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.240\nYou're not an iPhone user, so\nyou don't get exposed to this like I do.\n\n482\n00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.390\nI try and use as many devices as I can,\n\n483\n00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.810\nbut iPhone is a lot different from\nAndroid in the way that it shares things.\n\n484\n00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.160\nYou have what's called the share dialogue,\nin the share dialogue, it really is\n\n485\n00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.690\nthe gatekeeper in between applications,\nso it truly represents the sandboxing.\n\n486\n00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:15.580\nLet me show you an example.\n\n487\n00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.580\nI've got my iPad mirrored\nto my computer right here.\n\n488\n00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.760\nAnd let's say that for\nexample browsing the web, right?\n\n489\n00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.020\nSo I'm gonna fire up Safari and\nwhen I browse to a website like,\n\n490\n00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.880\nwe're gonna slash that, so when I browse\nto a website it's gonna pull up, right,\n\n491\n00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.810\nhere in the web browser and\nI start to see that content, right?\n\n492\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.090\nAnd everything's fine.\n\n493\n00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:41.560\nAnd then I say something like, boy, I want\nto print this web page, or I want to save\n\n494\n00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.600\nit as a PDF, or save it to Dropbox, or do\nsomething with the content of this page.\n\n495\n00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.090\nMaybe I want to take this web page and\nadd it to Microsoft OneNote or\n\n496\n00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.890\nWunderlist or something like that.\n\n497\n00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:53.840\nI want the application to talk.\n\n498\n00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.840\nThe only way I can do that\nis through the Gatekeeper.\n\n499\n00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.360\nAnd the Gatekeeper is represented in most\napplications with this little square with\n\n500\n00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.790\nan up arrow, that's the share button.\n\n501\n00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.480\nAnd when I hit that share button, so\n\n502\n00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.310\nI'm just gonna punch that,\na little drop down will appear.\n\n503\n00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.230\nAnd I'll see what I'm allowed to do.\n\n504\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.520\nAnd notice what I'm saying,\nwhat I'm allowed to do.\n\n505\n00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.600\nI could do a ton of things, but Apple is\nonly allowing me to do certain things.\n\n506\n00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.370\nSo I can save it as a PDF to iBooks.\n\n507\n00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:29.250\nI can send it to Facebook or Twitter or\nI can add to my notes or my reminders.\n\n508\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:33.100\nI see approved activities right here,\nokay.\n\n509\n00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.140\nAnd there might be some\nthat aren't turned on.\n\n510\n00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.900\nSo if I hit more or I might see\nsome here that are not enabled,\n\n511\n00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.870\nit looks like all of mine are enabled,\nthe same thing with the top row.\n\n512\n00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:43.990\nSometimes you can find,\nlike maybe I have Twitter turned off, and\n\n513\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.130\nI could turn that one on.\n\n514\n00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.780\nSo, you have a little bit of control.\n\n515\n00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:53.370\nBut all the applications are in this list,\nhave been through Apple's quality control.\n\n516\n00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.940\nThey've evaluated whether or not that\ncommunication should be allowed and\n\n517\n00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.050\nwhether it's done in a secure manner, and\nif it hasn't been, they don't allow it.\n\n518\n00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.901\nSo, if I want to say\nthis is a PDF to iBooks,\n\n519\n00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:07.260\nI can't let my web browser\ntalk right to iBooks.\n\n520\n00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.260\nI have to go through this method.\n\n521\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.090\nAnd that can be a challenge,\nbecause sometimes I might download a PDF,\n\n522\n00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.330\nand I want it to be available\nin my Kindle app, and\n\n523\n00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.840\nI don't have a way to send\nthat between applications.\n\n524\n00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.090\nThey don't allow that communication.\n\n525\n00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:23.550\nBut when I choose save PDF to iBooks,\nwhat's happening is, it's creating\n\n526\n00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:28.970\nthe PDF, it's sending it to iOS and iOS is\nthen gonna create that inbox folder I was\n\n527\n00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:33.070\ntalking about in the documents folder for\niBooks, and it's dropping that PDF there.\n\n528\n00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:38.010\nAnd then immediately, iBooks pops up and\nit says, there's something in my inbox.\n\n529\n00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.700\nIt's a PDF, let's go ahead and\nbring it in like and\n\n530\n00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.230\nsend it to iCloud or we'll bring it right\nin here, and now it's in the library.\n\n531\n00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:48.930\nBut iBooks never actually\ntalked to the web browser.\n\n532\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.820\niBooks just saw it's inbox folder and\nsaw this PDF appear, and there it is.\n\n533\n00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.790\nNow I've got this stored as a PDF and\nI can go back to Safari and\n\n534\n00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.790\ncontinue browsing the web and\ngoing wherever it is that I wanna go.\n\n535\n00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.750\nApparently no, we're too exciting.\n\n536\n00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.090\nSo we can go and\nbrowse the Internet and do our thing.\n\n537\n00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.640\nThe applications are separate.\n\n538\n00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.480\nThey talk to the operating system,\nthey never talk to each other.\n\n539\n00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.510\nSo that's a key thing to remember\nwith iOS devices like these.\n\n540\n00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:18.795\nIs Apple is always in between you and\nany communication that you make.\n\n541\n00:28:18.795 --> 00:28:22.040\nIn-between every single bit,\nwhich gives them a high degree of control.\n\n542\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.399\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, I know you\nreally wanna get an Android, but\n\n543\n00:28:25.399 --> 00:28:26.970\nI think we're pretty much out of time.\n\n544\n00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.796\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna need you to come back for\n\n545\n00:28:28.796 --> 00:28:29.760\na part two Don.\n\n546\n00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.190\nTo help us out and seeing the other\npart which is the Android part as well.\n\n547\n00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.930\nRemember what you took a look at in\nthis episode as Don really did talk\n\n548\n00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.950\nabout the idea of bringing in that BYOD,\n\n549\n00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.330\nand some of the different things\nthat can happen when we do that.\n\n550\n00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.770\nSo the idea of a managed\nenvironment is pretty key for\n\n551\n00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.490\nus when we take a look here too.\n\n552\n00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:47.960\nAs well as some of the different attacks,\nand\n\n553\n00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.620\nnow Don is showing us some\nof the different security\n\n554\n00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.550\nfeatures that are built into these devices\nas well, especially on the Apple side.\n\n555\n00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.930\nBut if you want to come back and\nlearn more about the Android side and\n\n556\n00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.850\nsome of the other ones that are out there,\ncome back for our part two.\n\n557\n00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.240\nIt's a great place for\nus to go ahead and sign off then.\n\n558\n00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.440\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n559\n00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.470\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n560\n00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:14.269\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more emerging\ntechnology security demonstrations.\n\n561\n00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:20.090\n[MUSIC]\n\n562\n00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:23.288\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
