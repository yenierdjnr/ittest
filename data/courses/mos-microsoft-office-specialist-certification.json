what exactly is in this\n\n6\n00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:19.110\nseries.\n\n7\n00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.540\nWho is this for?\n\n8\n00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.370\nAnd do I need to know anything\nbefore I get started?\n\n9\n00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.220\nSo why don't we talk about\nthe certification preparation?\n\n10\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.360\nI'm actually very excited\nto do this series.\n\n11\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.770\nI just recently I completed my\nMaster Office Specialist Certification.\n\n12\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.270\nAnd so\nI was pretty excited to do this because,\n\n13\n00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.320\nwell, it's fresh in my brain right now.\n\n14\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.900\nSo I wanna take you through well,\nexactly what is this certification.\n\n15\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.330\nLet's introduce it.\n\n16\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.070\nWho is this for?\n\n17\n00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.930\nWhy would I want to do\nthis particular exam?\n\n18\n00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.730\nHow do I prepare for it?\n\n19\n00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.480\nHow do I study?\n\n20\n00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.920\nWhere do I get the exam objectives?\n\n21\n00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.900\nHow do I register to take\nthis exam through Certiport?\n\n22\n00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.370\nThat can be a little tricky.\n\n23\n00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.940\nSo I try to take you\nthrough those little paths\n\n24\n00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.870\nthat they take you down that kind of\ndon't have the clearest directions.\n\n25\n00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.047\nBut I'll help you there,\ngive you some tips and\n\n26\n00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:11.910\ntricks on how to actually take the exam.\n\n27\n00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.650\nLike, what is the format?\n\n28\n00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.703\nWhat do I need to expect when I\ngo into that testing center and\n\n29\n00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:20.470\nsit down and take that 50 minute test?\n\n30\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.340\nWhat is it gonna look like?\n\n31\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.100\nSo I'll get you really prepared for\nactually taking the exam.\n\n32\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.050\nAnd then, well, hey, you passed, great.\n\n33\n00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.860\nWhat do I do?\n\n34\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.550\nHow can I show off that I\nhave this certification?\n\n35\n00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.260\nWe'll talk about our different badges and\nsome different websites and\n\n36\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.730\nhow to share it on socials.\n\n37\n00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.310\nThat will be a lot of fun.\n\n38\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.180\nWho is this for?\n\n39\n00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.600\nAnyone interested in\ntaking a certification.\n\n40\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.700\nOkay well, that's pretty broad.\n\n41\n00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.680\nBut why would I want to do this?\n\n42\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.130\nThis could be anybody that\nis coming out of school.\n\n43\n00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.600\nThis is actually a program\nthat a lot of middle and\n\n44\n00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.730\nhigh school programs they incorporate\nthis actual certification.\n\n45\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.426\nNow if you're a seasoned person\nin the workforce, you're like,\n\n46\n00:02:02.426 --> 00:02:04.990\nI'm taking a certification that\na middle schooler is taking?\n\n47\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.930\nWell, what it does is it's going to show\nproficiency in Microsoft Office products.\n\n48\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.298\nAs an end user, you have certified from\nMicrosoft, I know how to use Excel,\n\n49\n00:02:16.298 --> 00:02:18.020\nI know how to use PowerPoint.\n\n50\n00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.175\nSo it can be used for career advancement.\n\n51\n00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:26.980\nSo maybe a promotion depends on\nthat particular certification.\n\n52\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.540\nMaybe your organization offers\ncontinuing education units,\n\n53\n00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.160\nI think CEUs,\nthat maybe this could qualify for it.\n\n54\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.540\nSo this is all due to help better\nyourself and advance your career.\n\n55\n00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.560\nNow the prerequisites,\nproficiency in Office applications.\n\n56\n00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.700\nIf you're like well I kinda know how\nto use Word, but not really, wow.\n\n57\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.770\nShould I not do this?\n\n58\n00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.338\nNo, definitely strive for this.\n\n59\n00:02:55.338 --> 00:02:59.700\nThis is why we have OfficeProTV,\nwhich is, of course,\n\n60\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.600\naffiliated and is a channel of ITProTV.\n\n61\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.680\nSo I want to show you and give you all\nthe resources throughout my other series,\n\n62\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.350\nthe Word essentials, the Word advance, the\nWord expert and all of the other products.\n\n63\n00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.025\nAll of those series are to help\ntrain you in this application and\n\n64\n00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:23.400\nto have you become proficient\nin that particular product.\n\n65\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.020\nSo this series is just gonna concentrate\non what you need to look towards and\n\n66\n00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.090\nreally focus on for studying for the exam.\n\n67\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.930\nKnowing the product is one thing.\n\n68\n00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.120\nBut taking the exam,\nthat's why we have this particular series.\n\n69\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.200\nSo you need to know a little bit to start.\n\n70\n00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.040\nAnd then watch the series, and then we'll\ngo ahead and we'll get you certified.\n\n71\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.390\nWell, you'll get yourself certified.\n\n72\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.000\nI'll just help you along the way.\n\n73\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.480\nLike my other series,\nI do have exercise files and notes.\n\n74\n00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.600\nNow the exercise files are really more\nof like the downloaded material from\n\n75\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.427\nthe sites that you can get on your\nown if you go to certiport.com and\n\n76\n00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:05.666\nso on and so forth.\n\n77\n00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:09.180\nI do have some of my own materials\nthat I have made, some diagrams.\n\n78\n00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.610\nTook stuff off the Internet and\n\n79\n00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.090\nmade it into a Word document\ncuz I can't help myself.\n\n80\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.520\nOf course I made a table of contents and\neverything too.\n\n81\n00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.280\nSo, you can use that.\n\n82\n00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.360\nHopefully that would kind of\nconglomerate altogether for you,\n\n83\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.940\nor condense it down for\nyou and use my own materials.\n\n84\n00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.130\nSo all the links that I'm going to be\nvisiting throughout the different websites\n\n85\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.590\nare in the episode notes.\n\n86\n00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.078\nSo definitely go ahead and get those ready\nand print them out and check them off and\n\n87\n00:04:36.078 --> 00:04:37.600\nget ready to be certified.\n\n88\n00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.582\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
