this\n\n3\n00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.370\nnew series we're coming out with, which is\nthe MTA Cloud Fundamental series coming\n\n4\n00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.530\nfrom ITProTV and Microsoft,\nwho provides the actual content for this.\n\n5\n00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.610\nAnd joining me along here is Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.870\nWes, we got you here cuz you're\ngonna help us figure out what,\n\n7\n00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.060\nlet me just start with,\nwhat is this show about?\n\n8\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.320\nWhat can we expect from this show?\n\n9\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.840\n>> Well, one of the things that you're\ngonna see that is gonna be prevalent\n\n10\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.210\nthroughout this entire series is\ndemonstrating the fundamental knowledge,\n\n11\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.510\nthe basic principles that you\nsee in the Microsoft Cloud.\n\n12\n00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.020\nUsing basic skills.\n\n13\n00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.230\nThat's one of the things that's gonna\ncome up throughout the entire series.\n\n14\n00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.150\nIf you haven't seen or\nheard anything about the Cloud,\n\n15\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.720\nit's kind of hard in today's day\nnot to hear about the Cloud, but\n\n16\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.640\nmaybe some of these topics\nare a little bit confusing.\n\n17\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.280\nYou're going to see some of the\nfundamentals and some of the basic stuff\n\n18\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.750\nthat you need to be familiar with in order\nto get into Microsoft Cloud technologies.\n\n19\n00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.340\n>> Awesome.\n\n20\n00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.810\nNow Wes, what can we expect\nfrom the upcoming after this.\n\n21\n00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.380\nWhat can we expect content\nwise to see in those?\n\n22\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.250\n>> Well we're gonna be talking about\nthings like the service models\n\n23\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.980\nthat you can see.\n\n24\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.670\nYou know,\n\n25\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.470\nwhat are the different technologies that\nwe use when we talk about the cloud?\n\n26\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.180\nWhat does it even mean when\nwe talk about the cloud?\n\n27\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.420\nWe're gonna talk about\nthings like security.\n\n28\n00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.190\nSecuring that data when it's\nnot stored in our location, so\n\n29\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.560\nwe'll talk about things like security.\n\n30\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.550\nWe'll even look at how to\nconnect different services,\n\n31\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.260\nthe things like the Office 365 interface.\n\n32\n00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.480\nLook at the interface,\nsee what the interface is about,\n\n33\n00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.720\nsee how to use it, as well as\nthings like Microsoft InTune, and\n\n34\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.260\nwalk through some of the Microsoft InTune\ntechnologies likewise.\n\n35\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.970\n>> Awesome.\n\n36\n00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.340\nA really good question would be next\nis who is our intended audience?\n\n37\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.390\nWho will benefit from this series?\n\n38\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.970\n>> Well, if you are somebody that's\nlooking demonstrate to maybe an employer\n\n39\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.120\nor maybe a prospective employer that\nyou have that fundamental knowledge,\n\n40\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.470\nthat basic entry level skill,\nthat if somebody was to ask you a question\n\n41\n00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.700\nabout the Microsoft Cloud platform,\nyou'd be able to answer them.\n\n42\n00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.080\nYou'd be able to give\na conversation to them.\n\n43\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.900\nSo you're going to see that this is\nreally geared to people who already have\n\n44\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.820\nsome basic hands-on experience.\n\n45\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.040\nMaybe you've seen Office365 before.\n\n46\n00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.270\nHave you worked with firewalls,\nhave you worked with InTune?\n\n47\n00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.810\nMaybe not.\n\n48\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.090\nIt's not a requirement.\n\n49\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.600\nBut if you've got some introductory\nknowledge to Microsoft InTune that's\n\n50\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.470\na very good thing to have.\n\n51\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.750\nDo you have experience in things\nlike networking topologies,\n\n52\n00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.500\ndifferent devices in network ports.\n\n53\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.850\nIf you have some of those basic level\nskills then this is gonna be right up your\n\n54\n00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.640\nalley in moving,\nin stepping into the cloud technology.\n\n55\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.760\n>> Awesome.\nNow will the people watching need to have\n\n56\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.610\nany kind of prerequisite background\nknowledge, some already built\n\n57\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.165\nunderstanding about cloud technologies,\nor are we starting from the ground up?\n\n58\n00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:05.195\n>> Well as far as the cloud technologies\ngo, you really don't have to\n\n59\n00:03:05.195 --> 00:03:09.435\nhave too many of even the fundamentals,\nand we're gonna go over the basics.\n\n60\n00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:12.255\nBut there are some things that are almost\ngonna be assumed knowledge, so\n\n61\n00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:13.970\njust understand that.\n\n62\n00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.928\nWe start mentioning firewalls, you're\ngoing to have to know what a firewall is.\n\n63\n00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:18.070\nIf we mention a network port,\n\n64\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.910\nare you going to have to have all\nof those network ports memorized?\n\n65\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.140\nNo, but you will have to know\nwhat a communication port is.\n\n66\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.810\nYou will have to know what things like\nbring your own device scenarios mean.\n\n67\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.910\nThings like on site,\nthings like off site, or on premise.\n\n68\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.810\nAt least understanding some\nof the terminology here, but\n\n69\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.870\nmostly for the cloud portion of this,\nyou won't really have to know too much.\n\n70\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.400\n>> Now, Wes,\na lot of the series that we tape here, and\n\n71\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.810\nwe share with you good people out there,\nat IT Pro TV, they're exam based, right?\n\n72\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.830\nThey are driven towards\nsome sort of certification.\n\n73\n00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.920\nIs this an example of that type of series?\n\n74\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.450\n>> That's right,\n\n75\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.640\nthis is another one that falls under\nthe umbrella offering at Microsoft.\n\n76\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.300\nMicrosoft Technology Associate.\n\n77\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.070\nAnd they've got a handful\nof them out there, and\n\n78\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.550\nthis another one of the portions\nof that handful, if you will.\n\n79\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.930\nThis is the 98369 MTA Cloud Fundamental\nExam that you'll be taking,\n\n80\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.910\nand that's what we're going to go\nthrough as we go through this.\n\n81\n00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.960\nWe're going to be lining this up with the\nskills measure that you'll see required to\n\n82\n00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.340\npass that exam, and\nit is going to be exam oriented.\n\n83\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.640\n>> Awesome.\nWell it sounds like\n\n84\n00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.830\nthere's a lot of information that's going\nto be covered in these upcoming episodes.\n\n85\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.710\nIt sounds really exciting.\n\n86\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.130\nI'm actually happy to be\na part of this stuff.\n\n87\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.570\nI really enjoy Cloud,\nI know you do as well.\n\n88\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.920\nHopefully if you're watching this,\n\n89\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.500\nthis sounds like something\nthat maybe tickles your fancy.\n\n90\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.010\nOr maybe it's something that you need\nto know as a requirement for your job.\n\n91\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.516\nSo we look forward to you joining\nus in these upcoming episodes, and\n\n92\n00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:48.631\nwe'll see you then.\n\n93\n00:04:48.631 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.940\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nin today's episode we are moving on with\n\n4\n00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.680\nour cloud MTA actually, cloud fundamentals\nseries that we've got going on.\n\n5\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.340\nJoining me to help lend his\nexpertise on this very subject,\n\n6\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.839\nnone other than my good friend\nfriend mister Wes Bryan,\n\n7\n00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.140\nWes welcome to the show how\nare you doing today sir?\n\n8\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.825\n>> I'm doing great, it's great to be back\nhere as always, good to be on stage with\n\n9\n00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:39.678\nITProTV and that's right we're going to\nbe moving into MTA cloud fundamentals and\n\n10\n00:00:39.678 --> 00:00:42.560\nspecifically what we're\ngonna be looking at today.\n\n11\n00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.290\nAre cloud principles, and\nsome of the delivery mechanisms that you\n\n12\n00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.480\nneed to be familiar with if you're\ngonna get into the world, or\n\n13\n00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.730\neven a basic introduction,\ninto the world of cloud computing.\n\n14\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.040\nAnd it is important to understand\nsome of these basic models.\n\n15\n00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.780\nWe're gonna look at some of the things\nlike for instance, on premise,\n\n16\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.630\nwhen we talk about on premise,\nwell what does that mean?\n\n17\n00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.530\nWell, we're gonna define some of that,\nso you know what Dan?\n\n18\n00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.610\nI think that's a great place to start\nif we move into some of the different\n\n19\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.810\nmodels that we can have out there for\nus, the very first one being on premise,\n\n20\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.340\nmeaning where are we\nstoring our resources?\n\n21\n00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.580\nWhere is our hardware gonna be at?\n\n22\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.660\nWell, in an on premise model, this is\nmore of your traditional model that\n\n23\n00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.610\nmaybe you've been a part of,\nmaybe you've seen before.\n\n24\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.680\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at that,\nthe on premise model,\n\n25\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.500\neverything is typically stored\nwithin your company or organization.\n\n26\n00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.555\nNow this doesn't necessarily mean\nthat it has to be a single location,\n\n27\n00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:45.371\nbut it means that your company typically\nowns the hardware, they own the software.\n\n28\n00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:50.269\nI was gonna say they own the IT staff,\nbut maybe they don't own the staff,\n\n29\n00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:55.167\nbut they have to have administrators\naround, we have to have a help desk,\n\n30\n00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:59.260\nand all of that is gonna be\nmaintained by the company.\n\n31\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.570\nOne of the things about the on premise\nmodel that we also have to look at is well\n\n32\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.300\nwe really don't need to rely\non Internet connectivity.\n\n33\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.260\nNow, we talk about networking, we're\ntalking about cloud fundamentals, and\n\n34\n00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.980\nyou say, well wait a second,\nwe don't need networking?\n\n35\n00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.490\nWell, let me be a little more specific, we\ndon't really need Internet connectivity.\n\n36\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.828\nIt doesn't require Internet connectivity\nto have on premise devices,\n\n37\n00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:26.210\non premise resources, services and things\nlike your identity management right?\n\n38\n00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.120\nIf I've got an Active Directory\ndomain inside of my organization I\n\n39\n00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.720\ntechnically really don't need\nto connect it to the Internet.\n\n40\n00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.800\n>> So what you're saying is, is that we\nhave you mentioned Active Directory right?\n\n41\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.860\nIt's a Microsoft class,\n\n42\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.590\nmostly talking Microsoft,\nActive Directory's a big part of that.\n\n43\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.291\nWhat you're saying is it's on\na server in my building, and\n\n44\n00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.695\nwhen you say I don't need Internet\nconnection, not that he's saying that\n\n45\n00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:52.738\n[LAUGH] these companies are not\ngoing to have Internet connection.\n\n46\n00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.237\nObviously it's a little difficult for\n\n47\n00:02:54.237 --> 00:02:57.334\nyou to get access to their business if\nyou don't have an Internet connectivity.\n\n48\n00:02:57.334 --> 00:03:01.674\nWhat he means is that server is actually\nin that building, and if Wes or I or\n\n49\n00:03:01.674 --> 00:03:05.875\nanyone is sitting at a workstation and\nthey need access to that server,\n\n50\n00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:07.990\nthey go through the local network.\n\n51\n00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.995\nThey don't have to go through\nthe Internet and that's,\n\n52\n00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:12.178\nI think that's the differentiation\nyou're trying to make.\n\n53\n00:03:12.178 --> 00:03:16.767\n>> Yeah, actually maybe a better way to\nprobably say is that we technically don't\n\n54\n00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:19.644\nneed a WAN connection and\nwhen you think about it,\n\n55\n00:03:19.644 --> 00:03:23.550\nall businesses that are connected\nto some kind of network today need\n\n56\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.934\na WAN connectivity but it is not something\nthat is going to cause us a complete\n\n57\n00:03:27.934 --> 00:03:31.320\nloss of productivity let's say\nif the WAN link goes down.\n\n58\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.774\nSo we have things like identity\nmanagement that we need through things\n\n59\n00:03:35.774 --> 00:03:38.634\nlike Active Directory,\nthat's gonna be held on premise.\n\n60\n00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:41.475\nWe're gonna have things like\nenterprise level administrators and\n\n61\n00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:43.330\nthey're gonna be managing that database.\n\n62\n00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.820\nThey're gonna manage it\ninternally in our servers where\n\n63\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.570\nall of our objects are stored,\nwe need email servers, right?\n\n64\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.340\nWell, we're gonna have an Exchange server\nand that Exchange server's gonna be\n\n65\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.900\nmanaged by an administrator that is stored\nsomewhere maybe in a server closet in our\n\n66\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.470\nmain office and all of that email is\ngonna have to be managed and maintained,\n\n67\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.500\nand all the things that\ngo along with that.\n\n68\n00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.820\nSo for instance,\nif you need things like spam filters,\n\n69\n00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.740\nyour IT staff's gonna have to have\na good running knowledge of your\n\n70\n00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.940\nemail infrastructure to be able to\nsupport that, to be able to take and\n\n71\n00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.270\nmake sure that things like spam don't make\nit into your networks, malware and stuff.\n\n72\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.070\nAgain, going back to things like the\nidentity management, you're gonna have to\n\n73\n00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.510\nhave a staff that is onsite, you might\nhave heard that term, onsite as well.\n\n74\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.710\nThey're kind of synonymous terms,\nonsite, on premise,\n\n75\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.490\nyou can have multi sites that we'll\nlook at here in a little bit as well.\n\n76\n00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.190\nThings like file storage, right?\n\n77\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.560\nWhen we talk about file storage\nwhen it comes to on premise, well,\n\n78\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.400\nI'm gonna have to have hard drives, right?\n\n79\n00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.190\nI'm gonna have to have maybe a SAN,\nit's gonna cost some money too.\n\n80\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.750\nWe're gonna have,\nhey you don't have to have a SAN but\n\n81\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.720\nif you want high performance\nyou might need one,\n\n82\n00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.620\nbut the point is that we are going\nto manage and maintain it.\n\n83\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.860\nIf I start to accrue more storage space,\nas you do,\n\n84\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.920\nas your companies grow,\nas they get bigger you're\n\n85\n00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.020\ngonna have more data that's gonna be\nstored on your drives, well, guess what?\n\n86\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.550\nNow you're gonna have to\nimplement things like DRP,\n\n87\n00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.860\ndisaster recovery plans to make sure\nthe data that is stored within your\n\n88\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.210\norganization maintains the level\nof redundancy, availability,\n\n89\n00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.880\nand that the users that are authorized\nto access it can access it.\n\n90\n00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.600\n>> Yeah, there's a huge infrastructure\nthat goes along with supporting\n\n91\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.265\nan on premise type of environment,\nif I've got those servers, right?\n\n92\n00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:28.570\nLet's say we build what Wes is talking\nabout, we've got a SAN, we've got\n\n93\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.040\nActive Directory servers, got email\nservers, got spam servers, we probably\n\n94\n00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.600\nhave a whole network infrastructure\nas well for an internal network.\n\n95\n00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.179\nThat's a lot of stuff,\nwhat do I need for that?\n\n96\n00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:40.779\nI need backup, spare hard drives,\nthey gotta be waiting around,\n\n97\n00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:44.507\nI gotta have a good warranty that\ngoes along with all my equipment, so\n\n98\n00:05:44.507 --> 00:05:47.810\nif something breaks,\nhow quickly can I have that replaced?\n\n99\n00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.533\nThat goes into what Wes was saying about\ndisaster recovery, what happens if that?\n\n100\n00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:54.307\nI gotta be ready for\nall of those contingencies, and\n\n101\n00:05:54.307 --> 00:05:58.920\nwith the equipment there, especially when\nit comes to the physical aspect of it.\n\n102\n00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.192\nI have to support that and\n\n103\n00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:04.082\nthat's gonna cost me a little bit of\nthe old do re mi if I'm not mistaken Wes.\n\n104\n00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:05.250\n>> It definitely is and\n\n105\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.000\nthe more redundancy you add in cuz you\nwant some level of fault tolerance, right.\n\n106\n00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.670\nWe have data then our data really when it\ncomes down to it, you can have Identity\n\n107\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.090\nmanagement, you can have your email,\nyou can have your communications, but\n\n108\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.850\nall of that entire infrastructure around\nyour data, that's what's important, right?\n\n109\n00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.200\nCompanies stand to lose a lot of money\nwhen they don't have access to that data,\n\n110\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.260\nso we need to manage,\nmaintain things like storage.\n\n111\n00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.100\nThe other thing that when you're\nusing on premise models or\n\n112\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.550\ntechnologies you're gonna have to plan for\nthe future, right?\n\n113\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.350\nWe know that we're gonna\naccrue hard drive storage and\n\n114\n00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.321\neven five years ago right a terabyte,\nthree terabytes,\n\n115\n00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.290\ntwo terabytes or whatever,\nbe like five terabytes, we would say,\n\n116\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.150\noh that's a lot of storage now,\nit's not that way anymore, right?\n\n117\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.165\nFive terabytes, we can chew through that\nin a couple videos for that matter today\n\n118\n00:06:57.165 --> 00:07:02.980\n[LAUGH] Cuz there's a lot of storage space\nthat's needed, how about communications?\n\n119\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.221\nCommunications are all over the place\ntoday, you have internal communications\n\n120\n00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:10.537\nthat you need, maintaining my\nvoice over IP communications.\n\n121\n00:07:10.537 --> 00:07:15.144\nIf you have messaging services like Link\nout there, and we'll get into Link and\n\n122\n00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:19.290\nSkype but you need a way to communicate,\nyou need those voice over IPs.\n\n123\n00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.180\nYou need to implement things like PBXs,\nright, the private branch exchange for\n\n124\n00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.330\nyour communications,\neven if you're doing voice over IP.\n\n125\n00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.400\nGonna need some kind of software to\nsupport that infrastructure, and\n\n126\n00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.460\nif it's maintained internally,\n\n127\n00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.380\nthat means you're gonna have to\nhave a very knowledgeable staff.\n\n128\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.180\nWhen it comes with the personnel,\nwe're gonna have to train them,\n\n129\n00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.020\nwe're going to have to staff them,\nand there's always gonna be turnover.\n\n130\n00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.393\nYou have to make sure that you go through\nthe whole hiring process and that again,\n\n131\n00:07:46.393 --> 00:07:48.722\nit's gonna add some additional expense.\n\n132\n00:07:48.722 --> 00:07:52.610\nThe other problem with that,\na potential problem with that is,\n\n133\n00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.434\nas technologies update, and we know they\nupdate very fast, what happens if you\n\n134\n00:07:57.434 --> 00:08:02.114\nneed to roll out Advanced features you\nneed to roll out additional software,\n\n135\n00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:06.030\nsoftware upgrades,\nhardware improves and gets better.\n\n136\n00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.240\nWell with on premise your\ncompany is managing everything,\n\n137\n00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.420\nyour company is managing staff,\nthey're managing updates,\n\n138\n00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.490\nthey've gotta test updates, they've gotta\nroll everything out finally to deployment.\n\n139\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.540\nSo again they can get very, very tricky.\n\n140\n00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.840\nNow the other thing too with on-premise\nis, like we were talking about earlier,\n\n141\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.720\nmajority of your companies need\nan Internet connection, have a WAN link.\n\n142\n00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.810\nWell most companies have\na public-facing interest, right?\n\n143\n00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.470\nThey need to add, or\nallow the public to connect back in\n\n144\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.490\nto some portion of the resources\nwithin your network.\n\n145\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.970\nWell now we have security.\n\n146\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:47.010\nWe need be able to secure those\nresources that are within my network.\n\n147\n00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.030\nSo how do we do that?\n\n148\n00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.890\nWell, we do that with by\nadding additional networks.\n\n149\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.990\nSo we're getting a little more\ncomplex even in just a small network.\n\n150\n00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.080\nNow I'm gonna add the DMZ.\n\n151\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.520\nWe have the demilitarized zone in now.\n\n152\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.340\nWe can have people that connect from\nthe public back into the resources and\n\n153\n00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.940\nagain it boils down to security.\n\n154\n00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.170\nWhat if you need things like databases,\nyou need a database administrator.\n\n155\n00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:14.340\nThe complexities of database can\njust accrue a bigger cost as well.\n\n156\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.290\nSo there's a lot that goes on\nto even just a basic network.\n\n157\n00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.950\nNow I've got a lot of servers here.\n\n158\n00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.570\nYou could be very small you know, you\ncould need just one computational server,\n\n159\n00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.040\nyou could just need a single database,\na single web server.\n\n160\n00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.270\nThere's the other thing.\n\n161\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.380\nWhat happens if you design an application.\n\n162\n00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.810\nYou have a dev-team, they design\nan application, they push it out, and\n\n163\n00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.740\nyou need more computational power.\n\n164\n00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.180\nWell now what are we doing?\n\n165\n00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.160\nWe have to upgrade our servers.\n\n166\n00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.040\nWe have to upgrade whatever\nthe computing device is and\n\n167\n00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.210\nagain with on premise we're managing it,\nwe're maintaining it.\n\n168\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.540\nCould be a long deployment process, right?\n\n169\n00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.470\nTesting it, making sure that everything\ngoes right before we finally roll it out\n\n170\n00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.470\nto production.\n\n171\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.050\n>> And like you said,\n\n172\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.300\nyou have to have the expertise to\nsupport being able to do that.\n\n173\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.380\nIf you don't have maybe somebody that's\nin your infrastructure group that has\n\n174\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.100\nthe ability to update those servers,\nyou're gonna have to hire someone, or\n\n175\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.230\ntrain the persons you all ready have.\n\n176\n00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.594\nIt's gonna cost money for training.\n\n177\n00:10:08.594 --> 00:10:11.100\nThose things come along, and\ncorrect me I'm wrong Mr.\n\n178\n00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.730\nBrian, but the last time I checked,\n\n179\n00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.680\nall this equipment requires some form of\nelectrical impulse to make it all work.\n\n180\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.630\n>> That's right,\nthat's right you know, and\n\n181\n00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.510\nin a day and age where we're trying to,\nfor the most part,\n\n182\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.880\ntrying to save Earth going green,\nit adds expense to it, right.\n\n183\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.640\nThe other thing is in the development,\nand implementation.\n\n184\n00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.920\nWhat happens if you roll a product out,\nand it crashes your production network?\n\n185\n00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.380\nRight now you have to have contingency\nplans, rollback plans right, and\n\n186\n00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.160\nI have to have somebody\nthat's trained on site.\n\n187\n00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.710\nWell I could outsource this sure.\n\n188\n00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.280\nIt's still in premise, on premise.\n\n189\n00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.260\nYou could outsource it and you could have\na specialist come in but they can come in\n\n190\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.200\nfor probably an astronomical fee to\nhelp you with your networks, but\n\n191\n00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.090\nagain, your company's\nmaintaining everything.\n\n192\n00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.700\nNow, what happens if\nyou're a large company?\n\n193\n00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.660\nNow, if you're a large company here,\none of the things that you have to keep\n\n194\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.350\nin mind is that you can have\nmore than one site, right.\n\n195\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.030\nWe've only talked about\njust a single organization\n\n196\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.300\nthat may be isn't a multi-site.\n\n197\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.490\nWell, when you have Enterprise, right.\n\n198\n00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.310\nEnterprise goes a bit beyond\nbecause Enterprise now is combining\n\n199\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:21.420\nmultiple LAN locations\nwith multiple WAN links.\n\n200\n00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.700\nNow we have to maintain those and that's,\nthat gets into a whole other realm, right?\n\n201\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:31.290\nYou talk about your engineers versus\nthings like your systems administrators,\n\n202\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.320\nright now you have systems\nadministrators and\n\n203\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.250\nthey have to be set up\nin each different site.\n\n204\n00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.770\nSo let's take a look at that right.\n\n205\n00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.290\nWhen we have on premise, and\nwe got enterprise solutions,\n\n206\n00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.440\nthese are typically large organizations,\nand the dollar amount\n\n207\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.350\ncan skyrocket very very quickly when you\nneed to manage, and maintain the hardware.\n\n208\n00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.700\nThe other thing is,\n\n209\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:56.210\nit could be a complexity to manage\nconsistency across different sites, right?\n\n210\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.322\nMaybe in site one here.\n\n211\n00:11:57.322 --> 00:12:02.314\nMaybe I don't need a whole\nbunch of databases.\n\n212\n00:12:02.314 --> 00:12:04.200\nMaybe I don't need a whole\nbunch of web servers.\n\n213\n00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.960\nMaybe I've got applications that require,\nsome kind of web application that we're\n\n214\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.950\nusing as a line of business application so\nyou got web servers in that site right.\n\n215\n00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.650\nIt could become an administrative\ncomplexity as you start to get these multi\n\n216\n00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:25.060\nsites across great geographical locations,\nor expanse I should say.\n\n217\n00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.830\n>> Not to mention the increase in\nactual physical pieces of equipment.\n\n218\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.900\nThat's right, you know, so think about\nwhen you've got a unified type of\n\n219\n00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.140\napplication where even though\nyou're in multiple sites every site\n\n220\n00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:42.130\nis using the same application\nrequiring multiple WAN lengths.\n\n221\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.230\nWhat happens when the WAN\nlength that you've set up,\n\n222\n00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.570\nyour engineers have setup,\nit goes off line?\n\n223\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:48.190\nRight.\n\n224\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.750\nNow that whole entire site that's\ndependent upon that application\n\n225\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.520\nmight lose access to it.\n\n226\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.140\nSo when your engineers are designing\nthings like large organizations with multi\n\n227\n00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.890\nsites, they need to keep that in mind,\n\n228\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.990\nthat if you do have some kind of\napplication that's going to be used\n\n229\n00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.660\nacross all these sites,\nwell what happens if it goes offline?\n\n230\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.140\nThen for that entire site\nproductivity could be lost.\n\n231\n00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.850\nNow you might say,\nwell wait a second, Wes.\n\n232\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.430\nIf we lose connection to the internet,\n\n233\n00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.920\nwe're gonna lose connectivity\nregardless of where we're at.\n\n234\n00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.150\nWell that's right, it is true, but\nit's your engineers that are maintaining\n\n235\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.670\nthose links and\nmaking sure that they're redundant.\n\n236\n00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.840\nIf you have certain locations where maybe\nyou don't have an administrative staff,\n\n237\n00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.010\nwell now it gets a little bit harder\nto maintain that site as well.\n\n238\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.540\nIn a large organization\nyou're gonna have some\n\n239\n00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.860\nadministrators doing some travel time.\n\n240\n00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.430\nI know, Dan,\nthat I know you had worked for\n\n241\n00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.120\na larger organization at\none point as well that was\n\n242\n00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.710\nall over the United States pretty\nmuch as far as an insurance company.\n\n243\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:48.370\nRight?\n>> Yeah,\n\n244\n00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.870\nwe had multi-sites\nthroughout different states.\n\n245\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.640\nWe also have multiple sites\nin each state that was.\n\n246\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.550\nEach state was kind of its own sub-entity\nof the parent corporation, and\n\n247\n00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.830\nwe had, probably, a little over\na hundred satellite offices for\n\n248\n00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:04.840\nthe state of Florida alone.\n\n249\n00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.285\nIt was quite a large network, so it did\ntake a little bit of infrastructure.\n\n250\n00:14:08.285 --> 00:14:11.545\n>> Now, on any one of those sites,\ndid you maybe have a limit to, IT stuff?\n\n251\n00:14:11.545 --> 00:14:15.655\nI know it was a large company, but\ndid you have any one of those sites?\n\n252\n00:14:15.655 --> 00:14:18.015\nThat you might have to\nhave a traveling admin.\n\n253\n00:14:18.015 --> 00:14:18.795\n>> That would be me.\n\n254\n00:14:18.795 --> 00:14:20.265\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was you!\n\n255\n00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:21.146\n>> I was the traveling admin.\n\n256\n00:14:21.146 --> 00:14:25.649\n[CROSSTALK] We had zero support staff\nin all of our satellite offices,\n\n257\n00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:28.298\nbecause of the nature of those offices.\n\n258\n00:14:28.298 --> 00:14:32.681\nI would have to actually go to Homestead\nfrom Gainesville if you know how\n\n259\n00:14:32.681 --> 00:14:33.672\nfar that is.\n\n260\n00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:37.230\nThat's a very long drive it's\nlike four and a half, five hours.\n\n261\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.000\nIt's a very long drive.\n\n262\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.280\nI'd have to go down there out in\nservers if I have to do any physical\n\n263\n00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.110\nreplacement of something, or\nphysical access to things.\n\n264\n00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.000\nWe could hire somebody to come up,\nbut usually we didn't do that.\n\n265\n00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.570\nI would just jump in a van and drive down\nthere with all the equipment necessary,\n\n266\n00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.470\nand support that office.\n\n267\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.450\nWhen I was done I would come back to\nGainesville And that would be that.\n\n268\n00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.850\nIt was a long,\nit was a very hard that stuff.\n\n269\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.400\nWhen I heard I had to go somewhere\nyou'd just go ugh it was horrible.\n\n270\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.020\nSo it would have been nice to have\na staff but we didn't have one.\n\n271\n00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.450\n>> Sure so when that happens and\nremote desktop protocol goes down,\n\n272\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.400\nhands gotta now tie up the shoelaces and\nnow it's time for the sneaker net.\n\n273\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.900\nWell, that's a complexity in and\nof itself as well, and that for IT,\n\n274\n00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.850\nthat will make Dan less productive, and\nmaybe something that he's got better to\n\n275\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.680\ndo inside of the main office, or\nthe main branch where he's working at.\n\n276\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.170\nSo you can start to see that\nan on-premise location.\n\n277\n00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.780\nIt's a very good thing to have.\n\n278\n00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:39.320\nThere might be reason that you have to\nhave the on premise nature of a business,\n\n279\n00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.340\nand we'll get into it a little\nbit later in this series.\n\n280\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.183\nWe'll talked about security, and\nit doesn't want to sound like, well,\n\n281\n00:15:45.183 --> 00:15:48.843\nyou know, on premise is the devil,\nit's not, it's not what we mean,\n\n282\n00:15:48.843 --> 00:15:52.752\nbut what we're saying is it is a major\ninvestment It takes a lot of planning.\n\n283\n00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:56.452\nAs technologies are released,\nas things update,\n\n284\n00:15:56.452 --> 00:16:01.183\nas your company expands So\ndoes the cost to expand that business,\n\n285\n00:16:01.183 --> 00:16:05.790\nright, and\nit certainly doesn't come for free.\n\n286\n00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:12.050\nSo one of the things that we need to look\nat is more of a cloud based solution.\n\n287\n00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.110\nAlright.\nNow, we'll get into the OpEx models.\n\n288\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.330\nWe're going to look at some\ndifferent models here right now,\n\n289\n00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:22.610\nbut The other model that you can\nuse is taking that infrastructure,\n\n290\n00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.600\noffloading it to a third-party.\n\n291\n00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.310\nA vendor, a provider, and\n\n292\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:33.040\nthen you pay a subscription,\nand what does this do for us?\n\n293\n00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.430\nWell, this allows us to say all of that\n\n294\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.730\nsupport staff that we need,\nall of that extra infrastructure,\n\n295\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:47.520\nThe maintaining of the hardware itself,\nthe power requirements for all this\n\n296\n00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:53.780\nwe can just off load that to a vendor,\na cloud provider.\n\n297\n00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:59.650\nI almost said ISP but it is not ISP, cloud\nprovider now with everything in the cloud\n\n298\n00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.970\nthat means the servers are no\nlonger stored on your site.\n\n299\n00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.390\nThey're not on premise anymore.\n\n300\n00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.275\nThey're stored on somebody else's network.\n\n301\n00:17:07.275 --> 00:17:09.620\nSomeone else's network who manages and\n\n302\n00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.150\nmaintains the hardware,\nthe applications, right?\n\n303\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.230\nIf you are using a line of\nbusiness applications, and\n\n304\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.500\nremember we say that there's some kind\nof communication mismatch in your\n\n305\n00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.210\non premise infrastructure, and\nit pulls a whole entire site down.\n\n306\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.060\nMight not have anything to do with\nan internet connectivity or the WAN link.\n\n307\n00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.170\nCould be a bug in the server,\na bug in the application.\n\n308\n00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.870\nWell, you have to manage and maintain\nthat, and you have to go in there, your\n\n309\n00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.880\ndev team has to go in and figure out what\nwent wrong and where the problem may lie.\n\n310\n00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.630\nWe take those applications and\nwe put them in the cloud.\n\n311\n00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.900\nAll right cloud just\nbeing over the internet.\n\n312\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.210\nIt is another company that manages and\nmaintains it,\n\n313\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:52.280\nit's another company that if something\ngoes wrong, they will get in there,\n\n314\n00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.320\ntransparent to you and try to fix it.\n\n315\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.810\n>> So when you say cloud you talk about it\nbeing something that's on the internet.\n\n316\n00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.470\nA service basically is\nwhat it boils down to.\n\n317\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:06.840\nIt seems like what you're saying is it's\na service that's provided by someone other\n\n318\n00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.060\nthan you and\n\n319\n00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.890\nyour company, but is a part of your\ncompany in some way, shape or form.\n\n320\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.000\n>> Yeah.\nBoy, isn't that just confusing.\n\n321\n00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.270\nThat cloud term,\nit really can be confusing.\n\n322\n00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.830\nThat's exactly what it is.\n\n323\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.830\nJust think about it this way.\n\n324\n00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.720\nCloud, we're talking about the internet,\nand\n\n325\n00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.990\nwhen we talk about a cloud provider,\nwhat they're doing is they're providing\n\n326\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.510\naccess to their network\nthat they're maintaining,\n\n327\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:33.000\nand it becomes a portion of your network,\neven though you don't really see it.\n\n328\n00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.560\nRight.\n\n329\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.370\nSo when we talk about cloud,\njust think about you have\n\n330\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:40.420\nsome kind of service that you need Gonna\nrequire service, gonna require storage,\n\n331\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.930\ngonna require applications, computational\npower, and all of that's gonna be provided\n\n332\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.890\nby somebody else's network, and\nthey manage and maintain it.\n\n333\n00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.550\nThink about your email systems, right?\n\n334\n00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:54.180\nYour email, something goes off line,\npeople aren't receiving emails\n\n335\n00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.210\nYour administrator that's running the\nexchange server has to get in there and\n\n336\n00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.490\nhas to figure out what's going on.\n\n337\n00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.170\nWhy are emails being routed?\n\n338\n00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:01.670\nAre we on a DNS blacklist?\n\n339\n00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.700\nHopefully not, but\nyou start wondering what's going on.\n\n340\n00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.130\nWell, if we take that application,\nthat service as well and\n\n341\n00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:15.010\ngive it to somebody else and say, hey\nLet your engineers, your administrators.\n\n342\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.330\nThey can take care of that and\nI'll pay you a monthly fee.\n\n343\n00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.940\nAll right.\nI'll pay you a monthly fee and then you\n\n344\n00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.450\ncan make sure that we have according to\nsome agreement A certain amount of uptime.\n\n345\n00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.760\nAccessibility or\nyou know we can access our data.\n\n346\n00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.630\nSo your data is stored\nin a different location.\n\n347\n00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.480\nNow we'll go over, coming up as well,\nbecause there are hybrid models as well.\n\n348\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.210\nDon't think that if you go to a cloud\nmodel everything has to be stored on\n\n349\n00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.770\nsomebody else's network.\n\n350\n00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.140\nIn a data center where you have\nno clue where it is right?\n\n351\n00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.160\n>> And\nit also runs the gammit of serviceability,\n\n352\n00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.980\nif that makes sense to you, what I mean\nis we go with Wes's email model right.\n\n353\n00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.540\nIf I'm having my email hosted by somebody\nelse, they could either just be providing\n\n354\n00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.480\nthe physical hardware and the connection\nto it, or they could be actually\n\n355\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.070\nmaintaining the software that\nruns the email server itself,\n\n356\n00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:08.070\nnot just the hardware server, but the,\nthe software server that makes it work.\n\n357\n00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.110\nThey could be doing that.\n\n358\n00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:14.070\nThey could be upgrading and\napplying patches and security, hardening,\n\n359\n00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.750\nyou name it.\n\n360\n00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.730\nWe could go to all of the extent of having\nthem do everything and all we do is.\n\n361\n00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.140\nPoint our stuff to it, or\nthem saying, here's a server.\n\n362\n00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:22.790\nHave at it.\n\n363\n00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.480\nRight?\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n364\n00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.530\nSo if you think about it this way,\nmaybe it's very modular.\n\n365\n00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.610\nYou pay for\nthe service level that you want.\n\n366\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.640\nYou pay for the resources that you need.\n\n367\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:38.550\nYou don't need computational power for\nmaybe the When I say computational power,\n\n368\n00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.060\nlet me step back so\nyou understand what I mean.\n\n369\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:41.620\nRight?\n\n370\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.850\nWe've got data, we've got things like\nweb applications that need to run.\n\n371\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.280\nWe have databases that require\na lot of CPU, and we got to have,\n\n372\n00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.590\nwe have to store the data, right?\n\n373\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.470\nWe need to make sure that we have\n\n374\n00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.350\nthose resources available to\nprocess that information, right?\n\n375\n00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.230\nBut if I'm on premise, then what I\nneed to do is I need to make sure\n\n376\n00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.000\nthat whatever application I'm supporting.\n\n377\n00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.910\nThat I have a server, whether I use it\none day out of the month, or I use it\n\n378\n00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.140\nevery single day out of the month that\nit has the processing capabilities for\n\n379\n00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.730\nthe application that I'm supporting,\nright?\n\n380\n00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.940\nWell inside of the cloud I\ndon't have to worry about that.\n\n381\n00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.550\nI can tell the cloud provider,\nyou know what?\n\n382\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:22.480\nWe need a little bit of processing\npower during that holiday\n\n383\n00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.690\nweek right where our sales are just gonna\nboom, but after that holiday week's over,\n\n384\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:32.110\nwe're probably not gonna need that same\nkinda power to process these resources for\n\n385\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.340\nanother year, another 30 days or so.\n\n386\n00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.700\nYou don't have to spend the money\non all of the hardware.\n\n387\n00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.240\nJust to get that one weeks\nworth of performance out of it.\n\n388\n00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.870\nSo, it's nice to say, guess what?\n\n389\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.880\nWe're gonna pay a company, and\nwhen we need that ability, they can make\n\n390\n00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.710\nsure that the server's online, or maybe we\nneed a little more control like Dan said.\n\n391\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.210\nMaybe we want an install exchange.\n\n392\n00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:59.150\nWe want to make sure that\nevery bit of the exchange\n\n393\n00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.610\narchitecture is done by\nour administrators, right?\n\n394\n00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:03.370\nWe can do that too.\n\n395\n00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.780\nWe can say cloud provider,\njust says here, here's a server.\n\n396\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.210\nYou install the software,\nyou configure the software.\n\n397\n00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.580\nWell we got a limited IT staff well\nthat's okay here is some exchange server\n\n398\n00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.720\nin fact we just need you to go through\na few steps that connected to our cloud\n\n399\n00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.480\nbased resource and then from there on\nour administrators well manage it, and\n\n400\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.730\nif there's a outage we'll take care of it\nand will notify you on what's going on,\n\n401\n00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.450\nand will make it transparent so\nthat you can see that.\n\n402\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:35.030\nSo you do have a lot of benefits\nin a clown based solution Now,\n\n403\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:39.620\nwe've got some other things to\ntalk about as to why OnPremise and\n\n404\n00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:44.710\nCloud, how they work as far as\nyour expenditure models, but\n\n405\n00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.380\nunfortunately, I think, I've talked\na little bit too much on this one now.\n\n406\n00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.490\n>> You talk a little bit.\n\n407\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:53.360\nWe have a little bit of time to, do we\nhave enough time to talk about just a few\n\n408\n00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.480\nof the You were talking about,\npaying billing obviously is a big thing.\n\n409\n00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.680\n>> Yeah.\n>> Are we saving money?\n\n410\n00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.040\nAre we sending money?\n\n411\n00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.320\nBased on the different types of,\ndo we have enough time to talk about that?\n\n412\n00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.190\n>> Yeah, I think we can go\ninto that a little bit to.\n\n413\n00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:08.640\nSo, one of the things to keep in mind, is\nthat when you're on-premise, you pay for\n\n414\n00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.830\neverything up front.\n\n415\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.030\nAlright when you pay for\n\n416\n00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:15.870\neverything up front that means that's\nmoney that is going to be used or\n\n417\n00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:21.630\npaid out by your company immediately, and\nthat's something known as a cap ex model.\n\n418\n00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:26.250\nAlright the cap ex model, the capital\nexpenditure model you need to know is that\n\n419\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.960\nour-- Our company is going\nto buy the products, and\n\n420\n00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.120\nyou can see there's a lot of stuff\nhere that we might have to buy.\n\n421\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.330\nWe might have to buy our software.\n\n422\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.750\nWe have to buy the licensing\nto have the software.\n\n423\n00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.150\nWe've gotta buy our servers.\n\n424\n00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.570\nAll of that capital expenditure.\n\n425\n00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:44.660\nWhen they look at capital expenditure and\nthey call it cap X.\n\n426\n00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:49.220\nIt means that the value of\nthe money that you spend,\n\n427\n00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.560\nyou're not gonna see it\nwithin the first year.\n\n428\n00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.530\nIn fact, you might not even see it\nwithin the first couple of years.\n\n429\n00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:58.590\nThey've got different models that say when\nyou spend money on this server, let's say.\n\n430\n00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:59.909\nWe'll just boil it down to a server.\n\n431\n00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.250\nHow long it might,\nis it gonna take me to get my\n\n432\n00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:08.320\nmoney back to make it worth\nthe investment on that purchase.\n\n433\n00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.120\nWell could be a three year model, could\nbe five years, could be ten years right.\n\n434\n00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.510\nGive you an example right of an investment\nthat you don't see the return on\n\n435\n00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.000\na lot real estate right?\n\n436\n00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.530\nIf I buy some real estate\nI don't expect to see.\n\n437\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:26.670\nThe profit on what I spent,maybe in the\nfirst 3 years, first 5 years, 10 years.\n\n438\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.980\nSo capital expenditure means\nyou're going to spend and\n\n439\n00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.810\ninvest the money up front, all right,\nand it could be a major investment.\n\n440\n00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.890\nThe larger the company is\nthe bigger the investments.\n\n441\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:37.780\nAll right.\n\n442\n00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.270\nIt's not a bad thing, it's not a good\nthing but it is one of the options that\n\n443\n00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.910\nare out there The other thing we have\nis what's known as the OPEX model.\n\n444\n00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.710\nAll right,\nthe OPEX model is a pay as you go model.\n\n445\n00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:53.230\nAll right, it means I pay monthly for\nmonth to month for\n\n446\n00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.160\nthe services that I need.\n\n447\n00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.940\nAll right, and then I believe that that's\nDocked off the PNL at the end of the year,\n\n448\n00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.390\nbut you're seeing the benefits right away.\n\n449\n00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.040\nIt's a good short term investment.\n\n450\n00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.840\nIt's not a good long term investment,\nbut it's a good short term investment.\n\n451\n00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.800\nSo if you company doesn't have the initial\ncapital it needs to get into business,\n\n452\n00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.410\nat least it can get started now.\n\n453\n00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.760\nMaybe you're going to\nmove to on premise later.\n\n454\n00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.550\nMaybe you don't even want that.\n\n455\n00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.080\nRight.\nSo the Apex model If you\n\n456\n00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.460\nhave limited staffing.\n\n457\n00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.090\nYou can't pay for staffing.\n\n458\n00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.150\nYou can't have a multi site\ntype of deployment and\n\n459\n00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:30.980\nadministrative staff at site 1,\nsite 2, site 3, site 4.\n\n460\n00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.570\nWe don't want Dan having\nto lace on the sneakers.\n\n461\n00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:34.320\nDo sneaker net and\n\n462\n00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.740\nhave to drive five hours down to\na site To flip a switch, right.\n\n463\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.930\nWell, we can and more,\nprobably more tedious things too there.\n\n464\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.090\nNot to say that all that's\nwhat you were doing.\n\n465\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:49.990\nWhat you can do is you upload to\nthe cloud and then you pay them,\n\n466\n00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.850\nyou pay their engineers,\ntheir administrators, and\n\n467\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.660\nthey take care of it for you on\na subscription monthly by monthly basis.\n\n468\n00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.170\n>> Awesome, so\n\n469\n00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.730\nwe have a few options available to us and\n>> Like you said,\n\n470\n00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:01.860\nnot necessarily good or bad.\n\n471\n00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.070\nIt's just want is going to fit you for\nyour needs and\n\n472\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.020\nthat environment at that point in time.\n\n473\n00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.000\nVery, very close step, Wes.\n\n474\n00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.890\nI know you have a whole a lot more too.\n\n475\n00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.447\n>> Oh yeah.\n> Talk about plenty of more concepts to go\n\n476\n00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:16.251\nover when it comes to cloud, and\nunderstanding what the cloud is and\n\n477\n00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:19.587\nhow it can benefit us and\nour companies, but like you said,\n\n478\n00:26:19.587 --> 00:26:22.060\nwe kind of hammered on\na little bit to long.\n\n479\n00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.360\nSo we're gonna have to make a part two for\nthat.\n\n480\n00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.900\nWesley, thank you for joining us today.\n\n481\n00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.490\n>> Yes, definitely.\n\n482\n00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.580\n>> And thank you for watching.\n\n483\n00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.190\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITPro TV.\n\n484\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.960\nI've been your host Daniel Lawry.\n\n485\n00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.918\n>> And I'm Wes Byron,\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n486\n00:26:32.918 --> 00:26:34.227\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.810\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.990\nIn today's episode, we are continuing on\nwith our MTA Cloud fundamental series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.210\nJoining me again in the studio is\nnone other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.290\nWesley, welcome to the show.\n\n7\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.910\nGlad to have you back.\n\n8\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.220\nAnd where do we go from today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.950\n>> All right,\nwell we're going into part two,\n\n10\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.820\nbecause in the first part of this episode\nor the first episode I should say,\n\n11\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.160\nwe talked about some of the principles\nbehind Cloud technologies.\n\n12\n00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.475\nWe talked about the difference between\nthe on premise model and the Cloud model.\n\n13\n00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:46.510\nWe also talked about what\nthe capital expenditure model is.\n\n14\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.480\nCommon way of abbreviated CAPEX.\n\n15\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.551\nKeep in mind CAPEX model, your company's\npaying for everything upfront and\n\n16\n00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:54.920\nit could be a long term investment.\n\n17\n00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.960\nAnd I wanna kinda touch base\nagain on the APEX model.\n\n18\n00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.200\nRemember that the APEX model meant\nthat your company was gonna pay,\n\n19\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.400\npay as you go monthly subscription.\n\n20\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.690\nWell that kind of leads us into the\ndelivery mechanisms here in part two and\n\n21\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.470\nlooking at some of\nthe different service models.\n\n22\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.560\nSo if we take a look here.\n\n23\n00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.660\nWhen your company, remember when we talk\nabout OpEx, we talked about the fact that\n\n24\n00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.680\nmaybe your company has limited capital for\nan administration staff, right?\n\n25\n00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.760\nWhether it's a single site,\nmulti site, doesn't really matter but\n\n26\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.040\nyour company doesn't have the money\nto have a huge infrastructure for IT.\n\n27\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.440\nNetwork maintenance, right?\n\n28\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.310\nMaybe you don't want to have a lot\nof scheduled downtime, maybe again,\n\n29\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.060\nrelated to the staff,\n\n30\n00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.260\nyou don't have the availability to\ndo ongoing network maintenance.\n\n31\n00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.420\nHow about application development?\n\n32\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.340\nWhen you have application development,\n\n33\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.140\nit takes awhile to test your applications\nto build the environments for\n\n34\n00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.320\ntesting the applications, and\nthen going through the deployment process.\n\n35\n00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.820\nSo we can take a situation where\nmaybe we don't have those funds and\n\n36\n00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.500\nour office here doesn't\nhave a big staff and\n\n37\n00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.980\nwhat we can do is we can actually\noffload this into the Cloud.\n\n38\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.580\nSo keep in mind that when we\noffload this into the Cloud,\n\n39\n00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.800\nwe've got a few different\nservices that can help us out.\n\n40\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.710\nService models if you will,\nthat can help us out for our company.\n\n41\n00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.800\nOne of the ones that we have to\nthink about is our software.\n\n42\n00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.660\nWhat software, what applications\nare our companies going to run?\n\n43\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.520\nAre they going to be more\nthan a single application or\n\n44\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.930\nat times you run multiple applications?\n\n45\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.070\nDo you need web servers?\n\n46\n00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.960\nDo you need you know networking hardware?\n\n47\n00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.170\nDo you need communications?\n\n48\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.822\nDo you need computational power?\n\n49\n00:02:32.822 --> 00:02:37.720\nAll right so, one of the things that we\nhave look at are the three different,\n\n50\n00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.340\nI guess you would call them\nthe Cloud computing stack.\n\n51\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.280\nNow, it works kind of like a pyramid.\n\n52\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.700\nWhat you end up having, at the top of\nthe pyramid you have something known\n\n53\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.350\nas the Software as a Service, right.\n\n54\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.530\nWe're gonna start right there.\n\n55\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.290\nAnd you might see it abbreviated SaaS,\nhere.\n\n56\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.000\n>> SaaS.\n\n57\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.770\n>> SasS, that's right.\n\n58\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.140\nGotta love the acronyms, and\n\n59\n00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.370\nI tell you IT here,\nwe're not really short on those acronyms.\n\n60\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.390\nSo with our applications,\nyou have to figure out first of all,\n\n61\n00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.550\nwhat are the line of business\napplications that you want?\n\n62\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.020\nWell, with Software as a Service, one of\nthe good things about this, Software as\n\n63\n00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.920\na Service, is the applications are gonna\nbe maintained, again, by a provider.\n\n64\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.870\nThe provider allows you\n\n65\n00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.450\nto basically access the applications\ntypically through a web browser.\n\n66\n00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.830\nNow what are the benefits\nof software as a service?\n\n67\n00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.600\nWell, some of the benefits\nare you don't have to have\n\n68\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.400\nthe infrastructure to support\nthe applications that are running.\n\n69\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.120\nThe other thing that you don't\nreally need to worry about too much\n\n70\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.710\nare things like the recovery\nof the redundancy.\n\n71\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.482\nIf you think about a line of business\napplication that you might be using inside\n\n72\n00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:44.900\nof, outside of the Cloud I should say.\n\n73\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.810\nIf you have data that's stored on servers\nright, and it's stored on premise.\n\n74\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.300\nAnd if something happens with that data,\nyou have to go out and\n\n75\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.070\nyou have to figure out how\ncan I recover that data?\n\n76\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.580\nWell with software as a service those\napplications reside on somebody else's\n\n77\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.380\nnetwork, and what they do is\nthey provide the redundancy.\n\n78\n00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.210\nThey provide the recovery options and\none of the good things about that\n\n79\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.840\nis that it's typically\ntransparent to the customer.\n\n80\n00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.360\nI say the end user, your end users\nare typically employees, but\n\n81\n00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.420\nyou as the customer that are paying for\nthe service.\n\n82\n00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.050\nHere's another thing too.\n\n83\n00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.490\nWhen you have updates\nthat happen to software,\n\n84\n00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.090\nif you have the software on-premise,\nright?\n\n85\n00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.020\nAnd you go with that type of licensing\nmodel where you're installing doing\n\n86\n00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.150\nlocal installations.\n\n87\n00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.360\nMaybe you're using some kinda ESD,\nelectronic software deployment system like\n\n88\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.840\nActive Directory, and you're pushing\nout your applications to everybody.\n\n89\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.270\nWell, did that application\nactually make it to the end point?\n\n90\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.380\nDo you have to walk over and\n\n91\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.050\nfigure out, can that user even\nuse the application itself?\n\n92\n00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.750\nWell the good thing about this is\napplication updates and deployment\n\n93\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.590\nis very, very simplistic, because\nit really, we don't have to deploy.\n\n94\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.340\nThe only thing you have to\ndeploy is a web browser.\n\n95\n00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.550\nAnd one of the great things is most\nof your operating systems have some\n\n96\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.610\nkind of built-in web browser.\n\n97\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.460\nAnd it's great because when we talk about,\nfor instance,\n\n98\n00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.060\nthings like Office 365, right.\n\n99\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.390\nOffice 365 isn't just\nlimited to Internet Explorer.\n\n100\n00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.170\nNow, this is a Microsoft course here,\na Microsoft episode.\n\n101\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.460\nSo we'll be talking about\nInternet Explorer but\n\n102\n00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.050\nit works on things like Chrome, it works\non things like Firefox and Safari as well.\n\n103\n00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.150\nNow you do wanna pay attention to the\nrequirements because certain applications\n\n104\n00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.180\nmight run on certain browsers and\ncertain functionality might not work.\n\n105\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.790\nYou want to pay attention to that.\n\n106\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.810\nBut the great thing about that is your\n\n107\n00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.920\nend user's single point of\naccess all comes from something\n\n108\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.970\nthat going out the gate is built in to\nall of your operating systems, right?\n\n109\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.700\nNow I don't have to worry\nabout as an administrator, and\n\n110\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.760\nif I do deploy something like that\nsoftware package through like,\n\n111\n00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.930\nan MSI file out to the end point,\nwell do the software actually install?\n\n112\n00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.090\nIs there a network communication problem?\n\n113\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.200\nDo we have delays in our\ngroup policy processing and\n\n114\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.580\nall the things that go along with the\nactive directory infrastructure to deploy\n\n115\n00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.520\nthat piece of software?\n\n116\n00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.180\nAll I have to do is ask the end user.\n\n117\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.300\nCall them up and say,\ncan you open the web browser?\n\n118\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.710\nAll right, well if the web browsers\nnot connecting, well chances are,\n\n119\n00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.460\nit's gonna be internet connectivity.\n\n120\n00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.470\nAnd that's one of the things that's\nalso good about Software as a Service.\n\n121\n00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.170\nNow, it does require something,\nit requires internet connectivity.\n\n122\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.880\nBut as long as you have internet\nconnectivity and you pay your bill,\n\n123\n00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.560\nyou typically have access to the line\nof business applications that you need.\n\n124\n00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.550\n>> I was gonna say Wes, let me just\nmake sure that I'm following here,\n\n125\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.570\nthat way our viewers are following you and\nwe're all clear.\n\n126\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.460\nWhen you say Software as a Service,\nyou mention Office 365,\n\n127\n00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.170\nwe're thinking of Word, Excel, PowerPoint,\n\n128\n00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.390\nOutlook, these type of business\napplications that typically are found on\n\n129\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.420\njust about any work station across\nAmerica or in the world for that matter.\n\n130\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.210\nAnd it's locally installed\non the computer.\n\n131\n00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.460\nWith Software as a Service\nwe don't install software,\n\n132\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.250\nwe access it through the web browser?\n\n133\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.150\n>> Well, that depends and\nthere's always never gonna be.\n\n134\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.280\nIt is never gonna be an easy answer,\nright?\n\n135\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.320\nSo there's a couple of\nmodels with that as well.\n\n136\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.330\nSo if we look at the, if we look here,\nyou could see that for\n\n137\n00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.030\ninstance, Office 365 offers you\naccess to things like Excel,\n\n138\n00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.610\nOneNote, Word, PowerPoint and Outlook.\n\n139\n00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.940\nNow I don't have to install\nthem locally like Dan's asking.\n\n140\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.810\nNo I don't have to\ninstall them locally and\n\n141\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.260\nall I have to do is access\nthe online application.\n\n142\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.200\nNow, when I say online, that means\neverything is handled through the web\n\n143\n00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.470\nbrowser, but\nthat's one of the great things.\n\n144\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.830\nWith something like this,\nyour providers also give you the ability,\n\n145\n00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.020\nlike in Office 365,\nto install it locally if you want.\n\n146\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.002\nAll right.\nSo if you have, let's say for instance,\n\n147\n00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:42.920\nyou have an application that needs\nto be run on a kiosk, right.\n\n148\n00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.610\nMaybe you have a series\nof kiosk machines and\n\n149\n00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.070\nyour customers have to go in and\nfill out some forms or something.\n\n150\n00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.280\nWell, they don't have to have\nanything other than a web browser.\n\n151\n00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.660\nI don't have to go and\nmanage it individually.\n\n152\n00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.385\nI think about the whole sneakernet\nthing and managing software and\n\n153\n00:07:57.385 --> 00:08:01.840\nsoftware updates and we have to try to\ndeploy this out in larger organizations,\n\n154\n00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.450\nit gets very,\nvery complicated and complex.\n\n155\n00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.056\nWell with the updates the vendor\nusually handles the updates.\n\n156\n00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:11.090\nAnd they tell you when\nupdates are going to happen.\n\n157\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:16.790\nAnd again it all boils down to if\nyou need a certain application.\n\n158\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.020\nYou can pay for it.\n\n159\n00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.620\nIf you don't need that application,\nwell, you don't need to deploy it.\n\n160\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.593\nSo you do have the option, you know,\nto kinda expand over your question there.\n\n161\n00:08:23.593 --> 00:08:28.180\nYou do have the option there to pick and\nchoose what applications you want, maybe\n\n162\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:33.138\nyou don't use OneNote, maybe you have\nno intentions of even using PowerPoint.\n\n163\n00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:37.310\nWell, that's okay, you don't have to\ndeploy it, and if we think about things\n\n164\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:42.700\nlike Office Professional Plus like\nin Office 2013, 2016 now we're on,\n\n165\n00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.410\nProfessional Plus, if I'm going to install\nthat and I am going to deploy that.\n\n166\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.910\nLet's say that we do have to deploy\nit locally, that takes a lot of time.\n\n167\n00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.082\nThat's a pretty big package that's got to\nbe pushed out every single one of your\n\n168\n00:08:55.082 --> 00:08:57.834\ncomputers in order to let\nyour users be productive.\n\n169\n00:08:57.834 --> 00:09:02.396\nWell, if I don't wanna go through that\nprocess, if I don't have that time, well,\n\n170\n00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:05.997\nfire up the a web browser,\nconnect to the application online, and\n\n171\n00:09:05.997 --> 00:09:08.920\nthen when we close the web browser down,\nthat's it.\n\n172\n00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.455\nWe don't have to worry about\nwhere the application is.\n\n173\n00:09:12.455 --> 00:09:16.350\nWe're stored locally, and\nthe other thing goes with storage.\n\n174\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.830\nAlright now we'll talk a little bit more\nabout storage coming up cuz there is\n\n175\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.620\na platform that service model that\nwe need to worry about that but\n\n176\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.200\nwe don't have to manage and maintain it.\n\n177\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.120\nSo software as a service is great.\n\n178\n00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.979\nSoftware as a service allows\nyou things like your email.\n\n179\n00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:35.123\nAlright, email Exchange, if you're\nmanaging Exchange in house it can be\n\n180\n00:09:35.123 --> 00:09:38.298\na nightmare, it can be complex,\nit can be great as well.\n\n181\n00:09:38.298 --> 00:09:42.942\nBut if I want Outlook, right, and\nI don't wanna have to maintain it,\n\n182\n00:09:42.942 --> 00:09:47.824\nI can always sign up for Office 365 and\nsay, we're gonna use Outlook,\n\n183\n00:09:47.824 --> 00:09:51.725\nand we're gonna let their\nadministrators service this.\n\n184\n00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:54.870\nSo, this is,\nDan really the top of the stack.\n\n185\n00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.260\nWe're going to say it's like a pyramid.\n\n186\n00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.200\nThey break it down into\ncomputing stacks and\n\n187\n00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.290\nthe software as a service is\nthe top portion of the stack.\n\n188\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.770\nNow we move to the middle of the stack.\n\n189\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.842\nAnd with the middle of the stack this is\nsomething known as platform as a service.\n\n190\n00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:11.790\nNow, platform as a service\nis a little bit different.\n\n191\n00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.520\nI want you to think about a piece of\nsoftware, maybe you're using Visual Basic.\n\n192\n00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.330\nVisual Basic is the software itself.\n\n193\n00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.773\nBut what about the environment\nit need to run in?\n\n194\n00:10:21.773 --> 00:10:25.070\nIf you're coding, if you're programming.\n\n195\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.200\nI need a runtime environment.\n\n196\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.312\nI need an execution environment for\nthat code to run.\n\n197\n00:10:30.312 --> 00:10:35.141\nSo, the application software, top of\nthe stack, I can use the software but\n\n198\n00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:38.915\nI still need the environment\nthat the software runs in, and\n\n199\n00:10:38.915 --> 00:10:41.880\nthat's where Platform\nas a Service comes in.\n\n200\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.590\nPlatform as a Service,\nthis is where you get\n\n201\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:52.420\na provider that gives you the runtime\nenvironment, the execution environment.\n\n202\n00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.470\nNow one of the benefits of\nthe platform as a service.\n\n203\n00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.490\nThink about application development.\n\n204\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.670\nIf I wanna run application development.\n\n205\n00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.150\nAnd let's talk about it just for\na second here.\n\n206\n00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.030\nThe application on the runtime.\n\n207\n00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.651\nRight?\nI need\n\n208\n00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:06.280\nto develop the entire test environment.\n\n209\n00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.260\nI need to bring it online.\n\n210\n00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.800\nI need to figure out what it is that I\nneed to run in order to support that\n\n211\n00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.049\nruntime environment, so\nlet my programming languages like C++,\n\n212\n00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:20.270\nPHP, and .Net all work but\nI need to support it.\n\n213\n00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:25.354\nWhen you use Platform as a Service,\nwhat you're paying for\n\n214\n00:11:25.354 --> 00:11:30.948\nis that the provider provides all\nof that runtime environment and\n\n215\n00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:34.827\nthe good thing is you\ndon't have to build it.\n\n216\n00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:38.320\nThey can expedite it as well because\nyou have things like templates.\n\n217\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.180\nImagine you're testing software A,\nall right?\n\n218\n00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.023\nWhatever software A might be, all right?\n\n219\n00:11:43.023 --> 00:11:46.970\nYou know the test environment\nhas to be a certain way.\n\n220\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.320\nWell, if you're on premise you can go, you\ncan figure out the server requirements.\n\n221\n00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.557\nThe storage requirements, CPU, RAM, all\nof that, and then you have to build it.\n\n222\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.485\nNow you're done testing.\n\n223\n00:11:56.485 --> 00:12:00.733\nWe've just built this environment and now\nthat environment might not be suitable for\n\n224\n00:12:00.733 --> 00:12:01.559\napplication B.\n\n225\n00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:03.760\nSo in on premise what do we have to do?\n\n226\n00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.580\nWe have to go build the test\nenvironment for application B.\n\n227\n00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.400\nWell if you use platform as a service,\nand you offload this to\n\n228\n00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.900\nthe provider themselves, they can support\nyou by using things like templates.\n\n229\n00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.295\nApplication B is environment, that's\nwhat you need, we've got a template,\n\n230\n00:12:19.295 --> 00:12:20.510\nyou fill in a few, details,\n\n231\n00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.026\ndepending on what it is, your criteria\nthat you need, attributes that you need.\n\n232\n00:12:24.026 --> 00:12:28.460\nAnd you click go and\nnow you're environments ready to go.\n\n233\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.300\nAnd what if you need now application B?\n\n234\n00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.673\nWell that's okay you've got the template\nstill, now you can modify and\n\n235\n00:12:33.673 --> 00:12:37.045\ntweak it a little bit press go now\nyou've got your second environment and\n\n236\n00:12:37.045 --> 00:12:40.028\nthe first one doesn't have to be undone,\nits kind of like a we say\n\n237\n00:12:40.028 --> 00:12:43.897\nin virtualization right we get the roll\nback snapshots right once I'm done testing\n\n238\n00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:46.990\nsomething, If I need to put that\nvirtual machine in the state it was\n\n239\n00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.830\nprior to ever setting up the test\nenvironment, I can roll it back.\n\n240\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.438\nWell it is kind of along the same lines,\nright.\n\n241\n00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:56.119\nIf I am testing application A and I learn\nthat hey that whole entire environment\n\n242\n00:12:56.119 --> 00:12:58.906\nin fact the application is not\neven going to work that way and\n\n243\n00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:02.490\nI need to reconfigure everything,\njust roll back the template.\n\n244\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.083\nAnd start over again.\n>> So\n\n245\n00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:06.823\nwith paths we're really\nlooking at expedition.\n\n246\n00:13:06.823 --> 00:13:09.480\nRight?\nSay you're a programmer.\n\n247\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.180\nYou don't wanna have to say, oh I gotta\ncall sys admin and say, I need a server,\n\n248\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.580\nI need it to run Ruby.\n\n249\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.915\nI'm developing this Ruby application.\n\n250\n00:13:16.915 --> 00:13:19.420\nI also need a database.\n\n251\n00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.110\nDon't forget to add some storage for\nme in the sand.\n\n252\n00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.230\nThat all would have to\nbe done by somebody.\n\n253\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:30.010\nWith platform as service, I can just call\nmy provider, my client service provider,\n\n254\n00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.550\nand say hey, I need a Ruby platform.\n\n255\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.600\nOr, I log into the interface that I'm\nalready paying for and say, okay,\n\n256\n00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.790\nwhere's my Ruby environment, click that.\n\n257\n00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.800\nInstall, I'm good to go.\n\n258\n00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.790\nI don't have to install anything.\n\n259\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.520\nI don't have to know how\nto configure anything.\n\n260\n00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.980\nIt knows what Ruby needs to run and\nsurvive, and for\n\n261\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.770\nyou to be able to make your applications\nthat you're developing work on that.\n\n262\n00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.560\nAnd it's like a pre-built package.\n\n263\n00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.257\nIt's lovely,\nit's all encompassed into one thing.\n\n264\n00:13:53.257 --> 00:13:55.683\nI click go, and it does it.\n\n265\n00:13:55.683 --> 00:13:57.090\nI don't need to be a sysadmin.\n\n266\n00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.190\nI can be a DBA.\n\n267\n00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.867\nI can be a programmer, and I don't need\nto get them involved, take them away\n\n268\n00:14:01.867 --> 00:14:05.441\nfrom duties that they're currently\nworking on trying to be productive.\n\n269\n00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:08.540\nI'm now more productive,\nthey're now more productive.\n\n270\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.200\nWe're starting to see the benefit of\nusing something like cloud services,\n\n271\n00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.150\nespecially platform.\n\n272\n00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.040\n>> Definitely, Danny.\n\n273\n00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.380\nYou know you talk about\nthings like Ruby right?\n\n274\n00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.010\nCommon program languages.\n\n275\n00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.930\nWhat if I have somebody that\nknows something in C, but\n\n276\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.610\ndoesn't know something in MS?\n\n277\n00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.910\nThat may not be a limitation\nto your company but.\n\n278\n00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.320\nWell, now I've gotta build\nan environment that's ready for\n\n279\n00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.350\nthat particular programming language.\n\n280\n00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.921\nOne of the great things\nabout platform as a service,\n\n281\n00:14:30.921 --> 00:14:33.615\nsupports a lot of your common\nprogramming languages.\n\n282\n00:14:33.615 --> 00:14:38.278\nSo, if you have a diverse team that knows\nmany different programming languages,\n\n283\n00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:41.940\nit might not be something that's\nan obstacle for your company.\n\n284\n00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.690\nBut if you do have, you know, somebody\nthat maybe programs in a certain language.\n\n285\n00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.340\nWith those templates, the ability\nto just set that really quickly,\n\n286\n00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.180\nget it in gear,\nget the environment ready to go.\n\n287\n00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.700\nIt makes it a lot easier.\n\n288\n00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.490\nWhen we look at platform as a service, one\nof the great things about the platform as\n\n289\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.380\na service is that, when you look at\napplication testing, deployment,\n\n290\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.010\ndevelopment, I should say,\nlet's start that over again.\n\n291\n00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.380\nHow about development,\ntesting and deployment.\n\n292\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.590\nIt makes it a lot easier.\nAll right.\n\n293\n00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.440\nBeing able to roll back those changes and\nsay that test didn't work,\n\n294\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.440\nI don't have to bring down the system\nadministrator and say come\n\n295\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.290\ndown here we need to reset everything\nback and we gotta start form scratch.\n\n296\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.300\nNow I know you've built some virtual\nmachines before Dan yourself.\n\n297\n00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.956\nWhere you build the whole entire\nvirtualized environment, you make a test\n\n298\n00:15:26.956 --> 00:15:30.032\ntakes you four hours whatever just\nto set up the environment and\n\n299\n00:15:30.032 --> 00:15:33.745\nyou do one test on it it doesn't work\nnow you're back to doing four, eight,\n\n300\n00:15:33.745 --> 00:15:37.401\nten hours of reconfiguring your whole\nentire virtualized lab just to do one\n\n301\n00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:38.300\nfunctionality.\n\n302\n00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.493\nWell that's the same thing your dev,\nyour poor dev team's going through right,\n\n303\n00:15:42.493 --> 00:15:45.060\nthey test the functionality,\nit doesn't work.\n\n304\n00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.130\nYou've got to start from scratch.\n\n305\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.237\nNow you've got to build\neverything back up.\n\n306\n00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:48.680\nAll right.\n\n307\n00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.300\nBasically we can roll back and\nwe can, we can just expedite.\n\n308\n00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.610\nDevelopment, testing, and deployment.\n\n309\n00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.277\n>> Yeah even if I use something like\nsnapshot capabilities in a virtualized\n\n310\n00:15:59.277 --> 00:16:03.080\nenvironment I still had to build that\nenvironment that still took me time.\n\n311\n00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.522\nIs nice that I have that quick\nenduring reset button of a snapshot or\n\n312\n00:16:06.522 --> 00:16:10.220\nI forget what Microsoft calls it\nthey don't call it snapshot anymore.\n\n313\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.410\n>> Checkpoint.\n>> Checkpoint, there you go.\n\n314\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.000\nAnd I I've got that checkpoint\nfunctionality built into their software\n\n315\n00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.070\nbut again I still have to\nbuild that environment.\n\n316\n00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.670\nWith platform as a service I\ndidn't have to do any of that.\n\n317\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.920\nI could literally blow away\nthe whole testing environment and\n\n318\n00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.490\nthen within, and\nit's not a gross over-estimation,\n\n319\n00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.160\nwithin maybe ten minutes have\nthe entire environment back up.\n\n320\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.300\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n321\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.220\nIt's really just limited by your\nability to reset a template or\n\n322\n00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.720\njust implement a template.\n\n323\n00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.270\nAnd it can reduce the cost\nin that aspect right?\n\n324\n00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.090\nCost reduction in application development.\n\n325\n00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:49.310\nI don't have to have the systems\nadministration team constantly behind\n\n326\n00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.600\nthe dev team supporting every little\nconfiguration change that they need\n\n327\n00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.510\nlike Dan's already mentioned.\n\n328\n00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.010\nMost of the times,\nyour dev team can run it as well.\n\n329\n00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.140\nSo it does give you that benefit.\n\n330\n00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.910\nIt also allows, and\nthere's a recap remember, deployment,\n\n331\n00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.900\nwith the deployment teams or the dev\nteams, development teams, excuse me,\n\n332\n00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.430\ncan work with a lot of the common\nlanguages that they already know because\n\n333\n00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:15.340\na good majority of the service providers\nor cloud providers give you that ability\n\n334\n00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:19.530\nthat those languages work natively in\ntheir environment and what they do is they\n\n335\n00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:23.680\nprovide the API and the run time\nenvironment to execute those applications.\n\n336\n00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.640\nNow that's the the middle of the stack,\nright.\n\n337\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.240\nSo our software at the top,\nthat's what the users interact with,\n\n338\n00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.170\nthen the environment that that software\nruns in is where platform as a service\n\n339\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.454\ncomes in and also with things\nlike developing and coding.\n\n340\n00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:38.720\nBut now, we have the foundation.\n\n341\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.930\nThe base of the pyramid that\neverything kind of sits on top of.\n\n342\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:47.150\nThat is something known as\ninfrastructure as a service, all right?\n\n343\n00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.310\nInfrastructure as a service,\nnow we get down to things like hardware.\n\n344\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.660\nYou might say well wait a second Wes,\nwhen you say hardware here,\n\n345\n00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.090\nyou're telling me somebody is\ngoing to give me hardware?\n\n346\n00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.970\nWell, yes and no.\n\n347\n00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.930\nWhat it does is it provides things\nlike the computational power.\n\n348\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.840\nRemember one of things with on premise,\nif we're testing applications or\n\n349\n00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.030\nif we have applications that need to run,\nand we come to let's say a spot or\n\n350\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:14.820\na portion of the year where we know we're\ngoing to need a lot of CPU strength for\n\n351\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.410\nthat application that's running.\n\n352\n00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.520\nWell, if I'm gonna use, if I'm gonna have\nthis application that needs that computing\n\n353\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.310\npower, and I'm on premise.\n\n354\n00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.410\nWell, guess what?\nI have to go out and\n\n355\n00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.390\nI have to spend the money on the server.\n\n356\n00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.510\nHopefully, you've got some blank spots,\nCPU spots within your server.\n\n357\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.560\nYou're gonna have to do some\nhardware configuration.\n\n358\n00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.140\nWith infrastructure as a service and\nwhat's kinda interesting is for\n\n359\n00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.400\ninstance Windows Azure, it's kinda both.\n\n360\n00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.000\nIt's platform as a service and\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n361\n00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.830\nNow why are those really\nclosely tied together?\n\n362\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:45.760\nWell think about it.\n\n363\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.950\nIf you need an execution environment,\na run-time environment for an application,\n\n364\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.290\nyou're gonna need some resources.\n\n365\n00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.210\nSo the infrastructure as a service is more\nabout the computing resources that you\n\n366\n00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.680\nneed in order for\nthose applications to run.\n\n367\n00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.840\nSo, when we say computer resources, CPU\nstrength, that's what I mean when I say,\n\n368\n00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.220\nby the way, computational power.\n\n369\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.520\nWe need some CPU strength.\n\n370\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.550\nWe're not going to run this\non a little thin client,\n\n371\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.130\nwe're going to have to run\nthis on maybe one server.\n\n372\n00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.400\nMaybe multiple servers.\n\n373\n00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.240\nIf you think about it,\nhow about taking one intense process and\n\n374\n00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.469\nspreading it across a thousand servers?\n\n375\n00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.830\nNow you've got some what do they call it,\ncloud bursting,\n\n376\n00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.110\nright being able to really really expand\n\n377\n00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:34.860\nthe capabilities of what the application\ncan do right there at your fingertips.\n\n378\n00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.120\nMemory, right, we talk about memory,\n\n379\n00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.860\nmemory is everything in computing the more\nof it you have the more you can work with.\n\n380\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.550\nWell we're typically limited to\nthe amount of memory we have when we\n\n381\n00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.360\npurchase an object.\n\n382\n00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.230\nWe're limited by whatever that object,\nthat hardware, has in it.\n\n383\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.190\nWell, if you need to expand\nmemory resources as well\n\n384\n00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.540\ninside of infrastructures as\na service we call it scalability.\n\n385\n00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.940\nSaying, okay, well now I'm running\nmore of these resources at\n\n386\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.880\nleast at this portion of the day,\na peak hour.\n\n387\n00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.630\nPortion of the week.\n\n388\n00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:04.710\nPortion of the month.\n\n389\n00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.800\nSeasonal times throughout the year.\n\n390\n00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.090\nWe need to expand that capability, and\n\n391\n00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.850\nthat's where infrastructure as\na service also helps us out.\n\n392\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.620\nStorage, we talked about database storage.\n\n393\n00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.530\nLot of data, data needs to be stored.\n\n394\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.660\nWe need hard drives.\n\n395\n00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.460\nIf we're buying it,\nwe're in control of it, yes,\n\n396\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.190\nbut we're also in control of its failures.\n\n397\n00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:27.440\nWe're also in control of its upkeep,\nlife cycle management of the product,\n\n398\n00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.010\nthe hardware as well.\n\n399\n00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.167\nWe can scale up with infrastructure as\na service likewise with our storage.\n\n400\n00:20:32.167 --> 00:20:37.151\nWe can say, I have 500 gigs that\nI'm storing of crucial data but\n\n401\n00:20:37.151 --> 00:20:42.000\nnow we're going to the holiday season and\nit just doubled.\n\n402\n00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.870\nWell, what do I do?\n\n403\n00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:43.650\nDo I wait?\n\n404\n00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.910\nDo I go out and buy an expensive hard\ndrive to store that information when I'm\n\n405\n00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.230\nnot really gonna use that\nmuch storage after the fact?\n\n406\n00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.633\nInfrastructure as a service\nallows us to scale and\n\n407\n00:20:55.633 --> 00:20:58.650\nto reduce called elasticity, right?\n\n408\n00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.820\nIf I need more storage stretch it out.\n\n409\n00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.360\n>> With the traditional model\nyou really don't have an option.\n\n410\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.800\nIf I need that space,\nI have to buy that space.\n\n411\n00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.180\nI have to buy those drives.\n\n412\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.120\nI have to put them in so\n\n413\n00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.570\nthat it is available to my\ncustomers as they access my system.\n\n414\n00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.210\nBecause if it's not there,\nthey're going to get a big old error, and\n\n415\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.340\nthat customer experience\nis going to horrible.\n\n416\n00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.270\nMy business is going to decline,\n\n417\n00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.130\nand one day, I'm going to be filing\nsome sort of bankruptcy, right.\n\n418\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.980\nThat's what we want to avoid.\n\n419\n00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.400\nSo basically my hand is forced.\n\n420\n00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.560\nI have to purchase what I know I'm gonna\nneed and then when I'm not using it,\n\n421\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.490\neven though I need it for that short\namount of time I still had to buy it.\n\n422\n00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.090\nI still had to spent money on it and\nI still have to have it available.\n\n423\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.910\nEventually one day it will give me more\nof a return on my investment I'm sure\n\n424\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.780\nas my business grows and\nI need more storage.\n\n425\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.970\nAt a generalized state, but\n\n426\n00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.840\nwith infrastructure as a service,\nI'm accessing them.\n\n427\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.590\nI'm saying, well hey, I know I'm paying\nfor X-amount of storage right now, but\n\n428\n00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.340\nat this time, I'm gonna need more,\nand then they'll ramp it up.\n\n429\n00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.260\nBut when I'm done, I can say I don't need\nanymore, and they ramp it back down.\n\n430\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.510\nI pay for only what I use.\n\n431\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.280\n>> That's right.\nYou don't have to constantly scale up.\n\n432\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.820\nUpgrading, adding, upgrading, upgrading.\n\n433\n00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.710\nYou can scale out.\n\n434\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:10.840\nI need it, I just need more.\n\n435\n00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.230\nI'm going to add it and then once I\ndon't need it anymore I can reduce it.\n\n436\n00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.030\nNow, what does that mean for cost?\n\n437\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.560\nWell, it keeps your cost in check as well.\n\n438\n00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.940\nSo, when we talk about reducing\nthe amount of storage,\n\n439\n00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.200\nyou're paying for only what you use.\n\n440\n00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.410\nYou're paying for what you need,\nso that's a good thing too.\n\n441\n00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.730\nThe other part of infrastructure as\na service that we need to be aware of is\n\n442\n00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.160\nthings like your network and\ncommunications.\n\n443\n00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.450\nYou get the ability,\nall your networking hardware.\n\n444\n00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.600\nNow you say, well, networking\nhardware Wes, what are we gonna have?\n\n445\n00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.610\nSwitches and routers and all that.\n\n446\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.990\nWell, you're not gonna see that.\n\n447\n00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:43.840\nThat's gonna be on their end.\n\n448\n00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.750\nAnd they're gonna handle\nthe network communications,\n\n449\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.750\nthey're gonna handle the network devices.\n\n450\n00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.040\nWe also have the servers too.\n\n451\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.910\nSo what if you need a server\nto run this program on, well.\n\n452\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.800\nThat's where infrastructure\nas a service comes in.\n\n453\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.790\nAnd that's where virtualization\ntechnologies, and\n\n454\n00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.560\nreally we haven't touched base on\nvirtualization technologies but\n\n455\n00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.225\nthat's what's helping\nus basically perform or\n\n456\n00:23:06.225 --> 00:23:09.800\nuse this service is the fact that\nthey have one physical device and\n\n457\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.584\nyou say well I need a couple more\nservers for this portion of the year.\n\n458\n00:23:13.584 --> 00:23:17.490\nRight, again, I always take holidays here,\nright, as an example.\n\n459\n00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:22.210\nWell, I need a couple extra servers to\nsupport the workload that we have now,\n\n460\n00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.080\njust add a couple more servers, right.\n\n461\n00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.080\nYou don't have to go out and wait however\nmany days, 2,000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000,\n\n462\n00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:35.110\ndepending on how much your company\nhas to invest in these devices.\n\n463\n00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.070\nThat you're not gonna get the full\nbenefit for the next ten years.\n\n464\n00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:42.000\n>> And if you really look at the models,\nyou start with the traditional model,\n\n465\n00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.840\nthose on premise models.\n\n466\n00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.660\nWe talked about that on\nthe previous episode.\n\n467\n00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.830\nI've bought this pool of resources,\nand I use them for certain things.\n\n468\n00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.670\nWell, then we get into virtualization.\n\n469\n00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:54.317\nVirtualization comes along and\nnow I have a pool of resources that I put\n\n470\n00:23:54.317 --> 00:23:58.830\ntogether and I used my virtualization\nenvironment to say built it.\n\n471\n00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.697\nBuild a PC out of that,\nbuild a server out of this and\n\n472\n00:24:01.697 --> 00:24:06.127\njust Allocate the resources as we have but\nall those resources are still mine.\n\n473\n00:24:06.127 --> 00:24:07.884\nI still own them.\n\n474\n00:24:07.884 --> 00:24:12.240\nAnd if I want to expand it, I've got to\npurchase them and put them on the premise.\n\n475\n00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.440\nNow we're talking cloud, we're basically\ntaking that virtualization environment\n\n476\n00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.940\nthat we had on premise and\nmoving it out to someone else.\n\n477\n00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.930\nSo like, Microsoft,\nthey provide cloud services.\n\n478\n00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.707\nWho better, who's got the deeper pockets,\n\n479\n00:24:24.707 --> 00:24:26.783\nwho's gonna have the better hardware,\nthem or me?\n\n480\n00:24:26.783 --> 00:24:27.769\nWho's gonna be able to do that?\n\n481\n00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:32.126\nThey're a much larger company than\nmost out there, right, and for\n\n482\n00:24:32.126 --> 00:24:36.400\nthat reason even large companies\nuse them for cloud services.\n\n483\n00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.010\nSo now I'm accessing their resources,\nso when I say,\n\n484\n00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.440\nI need a PC, well, or\nI need a server, boom,\n\n485\n00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.050\nI go into my portal, I access,\nI create a server and it's good to go.\n\n486\n00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.240\nIf I need to scale up or\nscale out, I can do that too.\n\n487\n00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.261\nHey, this server it needs a little\nmore CPU, it needs a bit more RAM.\n\n488\n00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:55.340\nI add that, boom.\n\n489\n00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.616\nI have their resources to access from.\n\n490\n00:24:57.616 --> 00:25:01.648\nI don't have to go out and purchase and\nmake that available to my internal,\n\n491\n00:25:01.648 --> 00:25:04.592\neither, I guess you could\ncall it on-premise cloud,\n\n492\n00:25:04.592 --> 00:25:09.160\nwhich is a virtualization environment,\nor just on-premise physical equipment.\n\n493\n00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.150\nI don't need to do that.\n\n494\n00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.360\nI can access theirs.\n\n495\n00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.480\nThey give me the resources.\n\n496\n00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.128\nIt's a much better model.\n\n497\n00:25:14.128 --> 00:25:18.010\n>> Yeah and along that line of thought,\ntoo, when you talk about servers.\n\n498\n00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.780\nThink about a heavy workload that\nhits your servers during a certain\n\n499\n00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.330\npeak time of the year, all right?\n\n500\n00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.490\nWhere does load balancing come in, right?\n\n501\n00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:32.240\nIf I have this on premise, and I've had to\npay for this, and that server get hits and\n\n502\n00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.180\nit's constantly getting hit, well,\nwe need things like load balancing, right?\n\n503\n00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.150\nI wanna be able to distribute the workload\nevenly across multiple servers.\n\n504\n00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.870\nWell, if I've only got one server and\nthat's all I can afford,\n\n505\n00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.790\nI don't have that capability.\n\n506\n00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.350\nBut when you have somebody\nlike Microsoft who has\n\n507\n00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:51.700\nspent in the last few years billions of\ndollars on their cloud infrastructure,\n\n508\n00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.970\nthey can say,\nhow many servers do you need?\n\n509\n00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:54.868\nYou need a thousand?\n\n510\n00:25:54.868 --> 00:25:56.762\nJust like that,\nyou have a thousand servers.\n\n511\n00:25:56.762 --> 00:25:59.460\nYou can distribute that\nworkload across all of them.\n\n512\n00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.670\nWell, maybe you need 10 servers.\n\n513\n00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.207\nSo it's really up to you.\n\n514\n00:26:03.207 --> 00:26:03.751\nAnd that's one of the great things.\n\n515\n00:26:03.751 --> 00:26:06.665\nThey all work hand in hand.\n\n516\n00:26:06.665 --> 00:26:12.354\nComputational power, I need more CPU\nstrength, add another server, all right?\n\n517\n00:26:12.354 --> 00:26:16.354\nAdd multiple servers, add ten servers,\nhundred, thousand servers, and\n\n518\n00:26:16.354 --> 00:26:20.744\ndistribute everything across all of those\nservers, and you don't have to see it.\n\n519\n00:26:20.744 --> 00:26:23.550\nWell, you see the benefits of it,\nfor sure.\n\n520\n00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.340\nBut you don't have to see the back\nend work that it takes to do\n\n521\n00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.690\nthat because they're handling it for you.\n\n522\n00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.380\nAnd that's one of the things that makes\ninfrastructure as a service really\n\n523\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.490\nthe foundation that the runtime\nenvironment works in,\n\n524\n00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.740\nthat the software on top of that runs in.\n\n525\n00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.659\nAnd I think one of the last things I do\nwanna mention about infrastructure as\n\n526\n00:26:39.659 --> 00:26:42.625\na service, and this is kinda interesting\nthat I haven't mentioned this yet\n\n527\n00:26:42.625 --> 00:26:45.360\nis, well,\nwhat about the operating systems?\n\n528\n00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.260\nWell, I need an operating system.\n\n529\n00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:51.872\nWell, you need an operating system,\nyou can go out to Newegg or wherever,\n\n530\n00:26:51.872 --> 00:26:56.270\nwhatever third-party retailer is, and you\ncould buy your server operating system,\n\n531\n00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.580\nspend 800, 2,000, get into volume\nlicensing, however it works.\n\n532\n00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.450\nOr you can let the provider do it.\n\n533\n00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.600\nAll right?\nAnd we're not just talking Windows here.\n\n534\n00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.760\nI know we're talking about\nMicrosoft technologies.\n\n535\n00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:13.070\nIn fact, one of our other hosts there,\nDon Pezet, had mentioned that\n\n536\n00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:17.510\nhe was running something in Apache or, I\nthink it was a Red Hat or Cent box, right?\n\n537\n00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.800\nHe needed Linux.\n\n538\n00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.683\nOkay, well, guess what.\n\n539\n00:27:20.683 --> 00:27:22.670\nThey have that capability too.\n\n540\n00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:28.470\nYou can get the operating system running\non the machine that you need at that time.\n\n541\n00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.218\nOnce it's done, you don't need it anymore,\nrevert everything.\n\n542\n00:27:32.218 --> 00:27:34.848\nYou just say, okay,\nI'm done with this operating system, and\n\n543\n00:27:34.848 --> 00:27:36.220\nyou're no longer paying for it.\n\n544\n00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.270\nSo you don't have the long-term investment\nin things like licensing costs,\n\n545\n00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:45.310\nongoing support for the vendor,\noperating system that you need.\n\n546\n00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.150\nSo that's the other thing that we need\nto think about is the operating systems\n\n547\n00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:48.930\nthemselves as well.\n\n548\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.080\n>> Again, we're just paying for\nwhat we're using.\n\n549\n00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.760\nIf we're not using it,\nwe don't pay for it.\n\n550\n00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.750\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n551\n00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.120\nThey're letting somebody else use that,\n\n552\n00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.950\nand they are hoofing that cost,\nnot you and I.\n\n553\n00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.220\nSo it's nice to have that available.\n\n554\n00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.690\nIt's almost like an a la carte.\n\n555\n00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.710\nIf I want this, I want this,\nI might pay a little more.\n\n556\n00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:04.500\nIf I need a little less,\nI pay a little less.\n\n557\n00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.680\nIt's a very nice model.\n\n558\n00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.180\nNow Wes, we've been touting\nthe greatness of these cloud services.\n\n559\n00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.590\nObviously it's a very awesome thing,\nand it's quite trendy to do.\n\n560\n00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.830\nIt's a good trend,\nI think it is a good trend.\n\n561\n00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.340\nBut do we never need on-premise\nservices anymore, or?\n\n562\n00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.817\n>> No, tha-\n>> Are we going completely to the cloud?\n\n563\n00:28:19.817 --> 00:28:23.859\n>> No, and we're definitely gonna talk\nabout that some more as it relates to\n\n564\n00:28:23.859 --> 00:28:27.197\nsecurity, but we do have to\ntalk about that as well, right?\n\n565\n00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.730\nThere's a time when you need\na hybrid model, all right?\n\n566\n00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:34.040\nAnd hybrid model, guys,\ndon't think about electric cars,\n\n567\n00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.080\nthat's not what we're talking about\nwhen we say hybrid models, all right?\n\n568\n00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.720\nWhat we're talking about is the fact that\nthere is time, there are times, excuse me,\n\n569\n00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.310\nwhen you need to store your\ndata on premise, right?\n\n570\n00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:48.209\nMaybe you have some security concerns.\n\n571\n00:28:48.209 --> 00:28:51.596\nMaybe it just needs to be heavily\nmonitored and you need to,\n\n572\n00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:56.003\naccording to whatever your internal\ncompany security policy is, you need to\n\n573\n00:28:56.003 --> 00:29:01.430\nmeet that security requirement for\nwhatever guarantee that you're providing.\n\n574\n00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.430\nWell, that's where\nthe hybrid model comes in.\n\n575\n00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:06.930\nNow, if we look at the hybrid model,\nthere's other benefits to it as well.\n\n576\n00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.980\nHow about remote sites?\n\n577\n00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.211\nMaybe you've got remote sites, right?\n\n578\n00:29:10.211 --> 00:29:15.094\nWe talked about, in the first part of\nthis episode here, we talked about\n\n579\n00:29:15.094 --> 00:29:20.020\nDan having to go drive four hours down\njust to do some servicing, right?\n\n580\n00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.130\nWell, that's a lot of downtime for\n\n581\n00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.140\nthe person that's responsible for\nmaintaining the infrastructure.\n\n582\n00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:31.540\nBut if we've got the hybrid model\nin that remote site where we don't\n\n583\n00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.660\nhave the administrative capabilities,\nwe could push it off to the cloud.\n\n584\n00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.560\nAnd then in that site, it's the cloud\nprovider that is maintaining.\n\n585\n00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.650\nWe don't have to send Dan on\nsneakernet trip down to that location.\n\n586\n00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:46.270\nNow, I'm not saying that we're not gonna\nhave to put administrators in that\n\n587\n00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.450\nlocation, but it makes it easy.\n\n588\n00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.345\nEase of administration for remote sites.\n\n589\n00:29:51.345 --> 00:29:54.835\nAnother thing that it can help you do\nas well is maintaining consistency.\n\n590\n00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:56.935\nWhen you have multi-sites like this and\n\n591\n00:29:56.935 --> 00:30:00.675\nyou are using maybe something like\nActive Directory as an electronic software\n\n592\n00:30:00.675 --> 00:30:05.875\ndistribution technology as well,\nthen it's tough to maintain consistency.\n\n593\n00:30:05.875 --> 00:30:09.135\nWell, with the cloud applications,\nyou can maintain a consistency and\n\n594\n00:30:09.135 --> 00:30:10.530\nit doesn't matter the location they're in.\n\n595\n00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:14.020\nIt could be in the main office, it could\nbe an office halfway around the world.\n\n596\n00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.352\nYou know that when they launch\nup that web browser and\n\n597\n00:30:16.352 --> 00:30:20.168\nthey connect to that application, it's\nthe same application that you're seeing,\n\n598\n00:30:20.168 --> 00:30:21.288\nsitting at your office.\n\n599\n00:30:21.288 --> 00:30:24.307\nSo it also helps to maintain consistency.\n\n600\n00:30:24.307 --> 00:30:29.202\nIt also helps you to do something,\nhere's where our pockets come into play,\n\n601\n00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:33.966\nright, reduce the immediate cost for\nthose remote sites too, all right?\n\n602\n00:30:33.966 --> 00:30:36.696\nRather than having to deploy\nsoftware to manage and\n\n603\n00:30:36.696 --> 00:30:39.180\nmaintain the updates of\nthe software as well.\n\n604\n00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.503\nSo, there are times, and\nwe'll look at it when we go into\n\n605\n00:30:42.503 --> 00:30:46.542\nsecurity as some of the reasons you\nmay want to have the hybrid model.\n\n606\n00:30:46.542 --> 00:30:50.108\nBut the hybrid model just means portions\nof your company are held in the cloud,\n\n607\n00:30:50.108 --> 00:30:53.500\nportions of your data and your\ninfrastructure are maintained on-site.\n\n608\n00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.450\n>> Awesome stuff, Wes.\n\n609\n00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.920\nWell, we've covered a lot of different\ninformation when it comes to cloud\n\n610\n00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.839\nservices, and hopefully,\nwhen someone mentions the cloud,\n\n611\n00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:04.495\nsomeone says the cloud, it's now starting\nto make a little more sense to you.\n\n612\n00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:08.448\nAnd so we've demystified this\nenigma that is the cloud for\n\n613\n00:31:08.448 --> 00:31:11.120\nyou at least a little bit, hopefully.\n\n614\n00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.599\nIf you didn't get it, just watch these\nepisodes over and over again until you\n\n615\n00:31:14.599 --> 00:31:17.864\nfigure out exactly what we mean,\nespecially when it comes to things like\n\n616\n00:31:17.864 --> 00:31:21.476\ninfrastructure as a service or platform\nas a service and software as a service.\n\n617\n00:31:21.476 --> 00:31:25.351\nThose are big key ideas that you really\nneed to get ahold of and understand, so\n\n618\n00:31:25.351 --> 00:31:28.212\nthat when you're speaking\nabout cloud services you know\n\n619\n00:31:28.212 --> 00:31:30.075\nexactly what's being referenced.\n\n620\n00:31:30.075 --> 00:31:32.689\nWes, is there anything else that we\nneed to go over before we call it a day?\n\n621\n00:31:32.689 --> 00:31:35.021\n>> No.\nOne of the things I might say is that\n\n622\n00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:37.382\nif you are still a little confused,\n\n623\n00:31:37.382 --> 00:31:42.755\nMicrosoft does a good job at having\ndifferent experience level documentation.\n\n624\n00:31:42.755 --> 00:31:45.785\nIf you want the high-level overview,\nyou can go to Microsoft and\n\n625\n00:31:45.785 --> 00:31:50.120\nthey can say, this is infrastructure\nas a service, it does x, y, z, right?\n\n626\n00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.650\nIt doesn't get in-depth.\n\n627\n00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.730\nOr you can go to TechNet, and if you want\nthe white pages on it, you wanna get,\n\n628\n00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.800\nyou know, stereo instructions, you can\nget very, very in-depth on it as well.\n\n629\n00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.730\nI would recommend checking out things\nlike some of Microsoft's documentation,\n\n630\n00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:08.520\nbecause they really do a good job from the\nhigh level down to expert technical level\n\n631\n00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:13.660\non trying to, you know, just make you\nfamiliarize yourself with the concepts.\n\n632\n00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.430\n>> Excellent.\nThank you so\n\n633\n00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:15.220\nmuch, Wes-\n>> Yes, sir.\n\n634\n00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.053\n>> For walking us down this path.\n\n635\n00:32:17.053 --> 00:32:18.376\nAnd thank you so much for joining us.\n\n636\n00:32:18.376 --> 00:32:20.919\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncall it a day here at ITProTV.\n\n637\n00:32:20.919 --> 00:32:22.973\nSigning off, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n638\n00:32:22.973 --> 00:32:23.936\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n639\n00:32:23.936 --> 00:32:24.737\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n640\n00:32:24.737 --> 00:32:30.820\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Some of those policies include concepts like data ownership, data custodial responsibilities, and customer privacy measures, which is accomplished through customer controls and configuration, hardware/software design elements that prevent \"fence hopping\" through shared storage or resources, and extensive security auditing. They also explain compliance standards like HIPPA for cloud services.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.310\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.220\nin today's episode we're continuing on\nwith our MTA series on cloud fundamentals.\n\n5\n00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.460\nAnd joining we yet again in the studio\nto help us walk down this path\n\n6\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.950\nis none other than my good friend Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.440\nWes welcome to the show today,\nhow are you doing today, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.680\n>> I'm doing great man, it's great to\nbe here as always with ITProTV, and\n\n9\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.870\nthat's right we're moving along\ntalking more about the Cloud.\n\n10\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.860\nWhat we're going to be talking about today\nare some of the security requirements and\n\n11\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.540\npolicies.\n\n12\n00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.770\nNow, we're not going to be creating any\npolicies here, but we do have to find out,\n\n13\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.300\nif you're gonna be storing your\ninformation in the Cloud, and\n\n14\n00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.837\nyou're not gonna be on premise, does that\ninformation storage, or does the location\n\n15\n00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:59.240\nwhere you stored that information, does\nit maintain privacy, do you own the data?\n\n16\n00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.437\nIf you own the data,\nhow much of the data's yours?\n\n17\n00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.840\nThat's one of the things we've\ngot to think about in companies,\n\n18\n00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.870\ncorporations when you have customer data,\nat what point is the data,\n\n19\n00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.170\nthe private customer data,\nversus your intellectual property.\n\n20\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.020\nOne of the good things is that we'll\ntalk a little bit about the data itself.\n\n21\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.010\nWe're going to talk about how Microsoft,\nhow they manage and maintain it and\n\n22\n00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.700\nwe're also gonna look at\nthings like transparency.\n\n23\n00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.730\nDan, I think one of the first things that\nwe should jump in to is looking at how\n\n24\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.070\nMicrosoft manages privacy.\n\n25\n00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.150\nLet's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n26\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.670\nI've got this triangle here and\nthis triangle really,\n\n27\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.470\nyou have three major points when\nwe talk about Microsoft and\n\n28\n00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.590\nprivacy, that is\nthe ownership of the data.\n\n29\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.400\nYou have to have a clear\nestablished documentation\n\n30\n00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.260\nof what is user data versus, well, does\nMicrosoft own any of the information and\n\n31\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.850\nwe're gonna be looking at that as well, as\nwell as the processor of the information.\n\n32\n00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.770\nMicrosoft uses a couple\nof terms on this one.\n\n33\n00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.320\nI've labeled custodian on this\nbecause they'll use both terms.\n\n34\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.570\nThey're the processor of the information,\nthe custodian of the information they're\n\n35\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.310\ngonna be the ones that\nare holding the information.\n\n36\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.220\nThen finally, the last one is,\nhow are they managing some of the privacy?\n\n37\n00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.850\nDo they have access to your information or\n\n38\n00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.640\ndo you as the customer have\naccess to the information here?\n\n39\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.980\n>> So, Wes, this is kind of more of\na conceptual and best practices, or\n\n40\n00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.520\npractices that Microsoft and\nourselves are gonna be\n\n41\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.870\ndiving into to make sure that our\ndata stays private and secure.\n\n42\n00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.440\n>> That's right, and when we talk about\nthings like policies and procedures,\n\n43\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.520\nsometimes, this is where people say, well,\nI wanna see how you configure things.\n\n44\n00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.195\nI wanna see how you connect to Outlook or\nmaybe connect to Word online.\n\n45\n00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:48.065\nWell, unfortunately, we're gonna be doing\nthat, or fortunately I guess I should say,\n\n46\n00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.455\nin some upcoming episodes.\n\n47\n00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:53.600\nBut this is really about more of\na what I call the bureaucratic side of\n\n48\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.850\nCloud fundamentals.\n\n49\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.650\nLet's go ahead and\ntalk a little about data ownership.\n\n50\n00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.850\nWhen it comes to data ownership again,\none of the things that I've mentioned that\n\n51\n00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.830\nthere has to be a clear established\ndocumentation on who owns the information.\n\n52\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.090\nYou can actually go out to Microsoft's\nwebsites they do have something known as\n\n53\n00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.400\nthe Trust Center out there, so that you\ncan find out things like compliance,\n\n54\n00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.920\nthings like another concept that we're\ngonna mention coming up in this episode,\n\n55\n00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.670\ntransparency, and that Trust Center\ngives you a lot of great information.\n\n56\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.030\nLet's go and take a look at that.\n\n57\n00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.540\nOne of the first things that were\nlooking at is privacy by design.\n\n58\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.460\nPrivacy by design falls into\nthose three categories.\n\n59\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.306\nThey talk about who is\nthe owner of the information.\n\n60\n00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:42.680\nWhen you look at the owner of\nthe information, Microsoft, one of\n\n61\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.071\nthe things that they mention is that they\nare just the custodian of the information,\n\n62\n00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:52.390\nthat the customer maintains all rights,\nall titles,\n\n63\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.160\nand possession over this information,\nincluding when you are no longer,\n\n64\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.010\nmaybe, a customer of that service.\n\n65\n00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.760\nThe other great thing about this too,\n\n66\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.510\nis imagine all of this information that\nyou have in the Cloud, well, you can\n\n67\n00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.800\nimagine that some people might wanna run\nsome analytics across it, do data mining.\n\n68\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.140\nWell, one of the things that Microsoft\nsays right here on their website is\n\n69\n00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.490\nthey tell you exactly what\ndata ownership means for us.\n\n70\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.300\nYou are the owner of the data.\n\n71\n00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.200\nMicrosoft is just the custodian.\n\n72\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.080\nThey process the information.\n\n73\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.190\nThey also talk about it being your data so\n\n74\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.240\nif you do leave the service,\nyou can take your information with you.\n\n75\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.710\nYou can take your data with you.\n\n76\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.460\nNow, we've talked a lot about that.\n\n77\n00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.780\nI've mentioned that term.\n\n78\n00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.810\nWhat is the data?\n\n79\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.220\nWhat data are they talking about?\n\n80\n00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.860\nWell, there again, they make it real easy\nright here if you don't know what kind of\n\n81\n00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.880\ndata they're talking about, well,\nyou can always click this link here and\n\n82\n00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.070\nit'll take you over and you'll learn about\nthings like online or Exchange Online,\n\n83\n00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.830\nyour emails, even your calendar\nappointments, contacts, tasks.\n\n84\n00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.240\nYou can see, you can always download\na copy of your information.\n\n85\n00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.670\nNow This is during the service, when\nthe service is active, so it's not like\n\n86\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.120\nsaying, oh okay, well, you can't download\na copy until you quit the service.\n\n87\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.260\nIt just means that you always\nhave access to your information.\n\n88\n00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.250\nYour SharePoint documents,\nthey can be downloaded.\n\n89\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.080\nThey tell you that right there.\n\n90\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.270\nThey really label it or\nlay it out for you.\n\n91\n00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.090\nWhat happens if you're using,\nwe're going to show you in another episode\n\n92\n00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.860\nduring the series,\nhow to subscribe to the service,\n\n93\n00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.420\nhow to create your first tenant,\nhow to set up your domain.\n\n94\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.810\nWell when you setup that domain,\n\n95\n00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.090\nwhat happens if you're not\ngonna use the service?\n\n96\n00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.870\nWhat if you turn around and\n\n97\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.090\nfind out that maybe this service\ndoesn't have all the functionality.\n\n98\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.740\nYou're gonna see,\nthere's a lot of functionality in it so\n\n99\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.260\nI can't believe that, that'd be the case,\nbut for whatever reason,\n\n100\n00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.585\nmaybe you don't wanna\nuse the service anymore.\n\n101\n00:05:42.585 --> 00:05:46.380\nWell they also tell you domain\nremoval instructions here.\n\n102\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.465\nHow do I keep if I have my own\ndomain that I have connected to and\n\n103\n00:05:50.465 --> 00:05:53.430\nI'm no longer going to be\na part of Microsoft service,\n\n104\n00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.740\ndo I still retain the rights\nto my own domain or\n\n105\n00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.710\nis that part of Microsoft's databases now\nand is that part of their information?\n\n106\n00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.390\nAnd the good thing is they tell you right\naway that you domains can be removed and\n\n107\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.958\nthey give you the following process,\nand you guys can always check this out.\n\n108\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.960\nIn fact Dan, one of the things that we'll\ndo is we'll put all these links here that\n\n109\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.350\nwe're gonna look at for the Trust Center\nand some of the topics that we'll\n\n110\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.760\ntalk about, we're gonna put that in\nthe show notes, and make it easier for\n\n111\n00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.520\nthe customer, or you guys as\nthe viewers to get to that information.\n\n112\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.020\n>> Yeah, Wes it really sounds like\nwhat you're saying is that Microsoft\n\n113\n00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.946\nviews your data.\n\n114\n00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:26.670\nYou've come in to an agreement,\n\n115\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.670\nyou say okay Microsoft I want to work\nwith you and use your cloud services, and\n\n116\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.610\na lot of times that's going to involve you\nactually storing data on their systems.\n\n117\n00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.360\nBut they don't see that as them taking\nownership of that data, it sounds more\n\n118\n00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.390\nlike you're saying we're going to rent\nyou a space to put all your stuff.\n\n119\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.330\nThen, whenever you're done using that\nspace, you can remove your stuff and\n\n120\n00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.540\nwe'll take the space back.\n\n121\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.720\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n122\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.730\nIf you guys have ever had to rent storage.\n\n123\n00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.370\nI've lived in an apartment for a while and\n[LAUGH] I always learn when I move\n\n124\n00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.320\nhow much stuff I have and how much\nof it doesn't fit in the apartment.\n\n125\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.390\nSo what do you do?\nYou rent a storage location.\n\n126\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.220\nWell, you're renting that and\n\n127\n00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.630\nyou're paying a monthly subscription to\nkeep your, whatever it is, in the storage.\n\n128\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.500\nThen all of a sudden,\nyou say I don't need the storage anymore.\n\n129\n00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.740\nWell, what are they gonna do?\n\n130\n00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.590\nIf you're paying your bill, and\n\n131\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.790\nyou're not, I don't know,\nyou don't owe them money per se.\n\n132\n00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.540\nYou can go and they'll give you\nthe ability to take your stuff out of\n\n133\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.160\nthe storage location and\nhopefully close your contract down.\n\n134\n00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.650\nWell that's the same\nthing that happens here.\n\n135\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.230\nIn fact Microsoft says right\nhere at the bottom of your data.\n\n136\n00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.940\nThis is one thing that I really like and\nit really follows along the same concept.\n\n137\n00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.291\nIt says upon expiration or\ntermination, all right,\n\n138\n00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:44.138\nit says Microsoft provides you,\nby default, limited access for 90 days.\n\n139\n00:07:44.138 --> 00:07:48.194\nSo, I decide that I don't want, for\nwhatever reason, I don't want the service\n\n140\n00:07:48.194 --> 00:07:52.491\nanymore, whether this company decides it's\ntoo much money or maybe doesn't have,\n\n141\n00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:56.334\nthat plan doesn't have the functionality\nand the features that they need.\n\n142\n00:07:56.334 --> 00:08:01.620\nYou have 90 days, 90 days to get\nyour information out of there.\n\n143\n00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.340\nNow it goes even farther because\nyou can even integrate things like\n\n144\n00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.340\nPowerShell because we have data\nabout data, right, your meta data.\n\n145\n00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.500\nAnd they've got an easy way that you could\nexport all of that information out, so\n\n146\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.150\nthat you constantly have access to it.\n\n147\n00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.080\nSo that's one of the good\nthings to remember,\n\n148\n00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.350\nis that you are in control of your data.\n\n149\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.660\nIt is your data.\n\n150\n00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:29.650\nAnd they make a lot of attempts to let\nyou know that and be aware of that.\n\n151\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.460\nBecause if you think about it,\n\n152\n00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.270\none of the concerns today with\nCloud on a lot of companies'\n\n153\n00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.200\nparts that aren't familiar with the Cloud\nis the fact that is my data safe, right?\n\n154\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.350\nWe're basing our whole entire\nbusiness on storing the information\n\n155\n00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.470\nwith this provider and we wanna know,\nwell, is the data safe?\n\n156\n00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.770\nAnd if the data's up there Is\nit being sold to other people?\n\n157\n00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.060\nYou've probably heard before if you\nhave some kind of free account,\n\n158\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.260\nI say in the Cloud, but other services,\nsocial media and stuff like that, well,\n\n159\n00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.010\nthey're gonna tell you in their service\nagreement that this is our information.\n\n160\n00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:02.720\nRight?\n\n161\n00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.920\nThat's now that company's information\nbecause they're providing you with a free\n\n162\n00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.120\nservice.\n\n163\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.170\nAnything you put on their\nwebsite is gonna be now theirs.\n\n164\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.970\nIt's their intellectual property.\n\n165\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.660\nMicrosoft is not doing that here.\n\n166\n00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.650\nIn fact, they're being open, straight\nup with you before you even start, and\n\n167\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.430\nletting you know that yes, if you are a\ncorporation that's gonna store your data\n\n168\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.680\nwith us, and we're gonna be\nthe custodians when it comes time and\n\n169\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.570\nmaybe you pull the plug on this service,\nyou can get that information back.\n\n170\n00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.580\nIt was yours to begin with,\nand it stayed yours.\n\n171\n00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.510\n>> Very cool.\nSo\n\n172\n00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.830\nwhat else do we need to\nknow about ownership?\n\n173\n00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.251\nObviously, when we talk about data\nownership, what data do we have?\n\n174\n00:09:37.251 --> 00:09:40.713\nAnd you brought up that issue\nof is my data secure because\n\n175\n00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:44.774\nwe are putting our data out there\non somebody else's equipment.\n\n176\n00:09:44.774 --> 00:09:48.233\nWe're trusting them to make sure\nthat it is being secured up.\n\n177\n00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:50.273\nWe don't have the ability\nto go in there and\n\n178\n00:09:50.273 --> 00:09:53.732\nmake sure an antivirus system isn't\nbeing run on that exchange server or\n\n179\n00:09:53.732 --> 00:09:56.990\nany other thing for\nthat matter because it's their systems.\n\n180\n00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.890\nLike I said,\nwe're trusting them to do that for us.\n\n181\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.070\nNow one of the other concerns that we\nhave is that, is our data being mined?\n\n182\n00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.850\n>> Yes.\nAre they using it for\n\n183\n00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.860\ninformational purposes\nto advertise to people,\n\n184\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.570\nor collect data for other resources?\n\n185\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.310\n>> That's a very good point.\n\n186\n00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.650\nAnd it is definitely a concern that you're\ngoing to have for your corporation when\n\n187\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.890\nyou, you want to make the money off of\nyour own intellectual property, so.\n\n188\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.750\nOne of the things they say as\nthe custodians of the data, or\n\n189\n00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.020\nprocessors here.\n\n190\n00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.250\nIn fact, they mention it right here\non the same trust center part,\n\n191\n00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.450\nthey will let you know we\nonly use your data consistent\n\n192\n00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.840\nwith providing you the services\nthat you've paid for.\n\n193\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.090\nMicrosoft engineers, and I'll talk\na little more about this customer lockbox\n\n194\n00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.270\ncoming up here in a second.\n\n195\n00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.570\nMicrosoft engineers do not have standing\naccess to your data, all right.\n\n196\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.570\nIf you go,\nif you wanna learn more about this.\n\n197\n00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.790\nAnd I'm gonna click over to\nthis website here in a second.\n\n198\n00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:55.580\nBut I just want you to know that the\nengineers have to go through a extremely\n\n199\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:02.850\nstrict, supervised escalation process\nto even be able to access your data.\n\n200\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.080\nLet alone doing anything with your data.\n\n201\n00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.100\nAnd they let you know.\n\n202\n00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.830\nAnd in fact,\nthey talk more about the customer lockbox,\n\n203\n00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.920\nbasically a technology in implementation\nthat they have implemented so\n\n204\n00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.070\nthat the customer has complete\naccess over their information.\n\n205\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.030\nAnd if Microsoft does have to\naccess your information for\n\n206\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.310\nany reason you're notified, all right.\n\n207\n00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.530\nSo as the custodians and\nprocessor of the information,\n\n208\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:35.380\nif they need to access it outside of the\nrealm of providing you the service that\n\n209\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.340\nyou've signed on for, they're gonna\nhave to make a formal request.\n\n210\n00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.280\nAnd one of the good things about this is,\nthe formal request,\n\n211\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:47.710\nlet's say Dan's company needs to or\ngets that request that says hey,\n\n212\n00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.250\nthe engineer needs to access your data,\nDan's company says no.\n\n213\n00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:55.300\nWe've got a contact security policy\nthat says you cannot access that data.\n\n214\n00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.020\nWell guess what,\nMicrosoft will follow suit and\n\n215\n00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.240\ntheir engineers will not be\nable to access the information.\n\n216\n00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.390\nNow they also do some other things too\nwhen it comes to disclosure of law\n\n217\n00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.050\nenforcement, right.\n\n218\n00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.100\nThat's gonna have to happen.\n\n219\n00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.580\nThese major businesses for obvious\nreasons, they have to work for federal and\n\n220\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.370\nwhatever the local law enforcements\nare if they are subpoenaed for\n\n221\n00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.235\nany reason for access to your information.\n\n222\n00:12:18.235 --> 00:12:18.975\nWell, guess what?\n\n223\n00:12:18.975 --> 00:12:24.765\nOne of the things is they will\ndisclose law enforcement requests.\n\n224\n00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:26.765\nWe're gonna talk about\ntransparency coming up so\n\n225\n00:12:26.765 --> 00:12:29.555\nwe're not gonna touch on that right now,\nwe're gonna get back to the transparency.\n\n226\n00:12:29.555 --> 00:12:30.807\nBut the fact of the matter is,\n\n227\n00:12:30.807 --> 00:12:34.475\nthat your data does stay private\neven to law enforcement.\n\n228\n00:12:34.475 --> 00:12:35.535\nAll right.\n\n229\n00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:37.545\nIf the government,\nnotice it says, approaches us for\n\n230\n00:12:37.545 --> 00:12:41.040\ncustomer data we redirect\nthe inquiry to you.\n\n231\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.420\nIt doesn't go to them and\nthey don't have the final say so.\n\n232\n00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:49.090\nNow, there are, you have to pay\nattention to the fine print here,\n\n233\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.250\nbecause if they are subpoenaed in\na legal manner where they are required\n\n234\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.700\nunder federal law to give access to you,\nthey still let you know.\n\n235\n00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.880\nUnless whatever the security measure\nis that the government is coming\n\n236\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.340\nat them about your data for\n\n237\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.170\nsays no, you can't disclose this\nbecause they're under investigation.\n\n238\n00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:10.070\nThey make it very, very transparent.\n\n239\n00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.470\nThey make it open so\nthat you can see that.\n\n240\n00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.970\nSo again, their role as data processor,\ncustodian of the information, and\n\n241\n00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.490\neven they don't have access to it,\nand they don't use your information or\n\n242\n00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.420\nsell your information to third parties for\nadvertising purposes or even for\n\n243\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.900\ntheir own internal benefit,\nwhich is a good thing to have.\n\n244\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.250\n>> Now Wes,\ndoes Microsoft take any other steps or\n\n245\n00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.380\narrangements to make sure\nthat your data stays private?\n\n246\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.270\nCuz we understand the Cloud services,\n\n247\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.330\nyou are doing things like you're\nsharing hard drives, you're processors,\n\n248\n00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:45.310\nyou are sharing RAM space so it can be\na concern to some customers, thinking\n\n249\n00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.590\nI might be as secure as Fort Knox but\nthe guy that I'm sharing hard drive space\n\n250\n00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:56.850\nwith might not be and therefore allowing\nentry into my side of the world.\n\n251\n00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.170\nIs that a possibility?\n\n252\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.180\nDo they take measures to\nprevent that kind of thing?\n\n253\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.630\n>> They do, and in fact, they do mention\nthat here as well on the privacy policy.\n\n254\n00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.060\nCuz like Dan said, think about it, right?\n\n255\n00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.450\nYou've got access.\n\n256\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.990\nAnd one of the things that we really\nhaven't discussed and we're gonna throw\n\n257\n00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.520\ninto the series as we go through it\nis the whole virtualization aspect.\n\n258\n00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.220\nThat's what makes the Cloud happen.\n\n259\n00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.720\nThe fact that you have a data center and\n\n260\n00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.100\nyour servers are running side by side\nwith other companies' servers, right?\n\n261\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.750\nVirtualized servers, virtualized\nmachines are running in memory, and\n\n262\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.150\nyou think well, memory, right?\n\n263\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.650\nAnd they'll find access across all\nthe memory within that data center.\n\n264\n00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.870\nI don't want people having\naccess to my information.\n\n265\n00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:38.130\nSo their design elements and\nthey even put this in print right here.\n\n266\n00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.260\nThey tell you privacy controls,\nwell we'll get to that here in a second.\n\n267\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.280\nThe design elements,\nthat's the big one right here, right.\n\n268\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.470\nDesign elements prevent data mingling for\n\n269\n00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.840\nexactly some of the security\nconcerns that Dan has.\n\n270\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.480\nI don't want my information stored in RAM\n\n271\n00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.730\nnext to a somebody who says,\nyou know what?\n\n272\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.640\nWe don't do any security here,\nin fact we leave the front doors open,\n\n273\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.450\nwe open all the windows,\nanybody can come in.\n\n274\n00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.380\nBut then you've got a company that\nhas strict security policies,\n\n275\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.980\nstrict security compliance\nthat they need to follow.\n\n276\n00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.470\nThey want to make sure that beyond\na shadow of a doubt that their information\n\n277\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.610\nis safe when it's stored\non joint servers like that.\n\n278\n00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:19.400\nNow the other thing that's really\nreally interesting is the auditing.\n\n279\n00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.620\nAll right, now we're not talking about you\nas a customer being audited all right.\n\n280\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.190\nWe're talking about their employees right.\n\n281\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.700\nMicrosoft has spent billions of dollars\non their Cloud infrastructure right.\n\n282\n00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.940\nSo it's a pretty big infrastructure and\n\n283\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.900\nI'm sure there's a pretty big\nstaff behind it to maintain it.\n\n284\n00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.460\nWell they go through an auditing and\nsupervision process right.\n\n285\n00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.670\nPrevents administrators from getting\nunauthorized access to your data and\n\n286\n00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.290\nthen moving back to the customer\nlockbox side of this.\n\n287\n00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:51.178\nEven if they need access to your data,\nthey have a very very strict escalation\n\n288\n00:15:51.178 --> 00:15:53.968\nprocess, like it has to\ngo to the top right.\n\n289\n00:15:53.968 --> 00:15:57.834\nSo when I say escalation process,\nmaybe as fundamentals, Cloud fundamentals,\n\n290\n00:15:57.834 --> 00:15:59.738\nmaybe they haven't heard of that term so\n\n291\n00:15:59.738 --> 00:16:02.887\nlet me go ahead and tell you what\nthat term escalation means right.\n\n292\n00:16:02.887 --> 00:16:08.177\nWhen you have anything that needs to\nhappen that's important within a company,\n\n293\n00:16:08.177 --> 00:16:08.730\nright?\n\n294\n00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.910\nWe talk about, for instance, Dan, I know\nyou worked for a major company that maybe\n\n295\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.780\nyou had to create a user account or\nmaybe somebody needed\n\n296\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.380\nup at the higher ups needed a password\nchange and said, well, I'm the manager.\n\n297\n00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.390\nJust change that password cuz I told you.\n\n298\n00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.870\nWell, Dan, I can only imagine that you\nprobably had some strict procedure\n\n299\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.150\nthat you had to follow through before\nyou could just reset a password.\n\n300\n00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.460\nAnd this is just a password.\n\n301\n00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.860\nIt really doesn't even\nhave to do with the data.\n\n302\n00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.030\nDo you have to deal with them?\n\n303\n00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.500\n>> Oh, yeah,\nI've actually got dressed down for\n\n304\n00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.240\ngoing a little beyond what my\nroles were because one of our\n\n305\n00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:45.210\nusers was having problems with her\nemail and it was the head of HR, right?\n\n306\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.620\nSo she had multiple email inboxes.\n\n307\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.678\nI go in and try to help her.\n\n308\n00:16:48.678 --> 00:16:49.220\nAnd I'm like,\n\n309\n00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.980\nit'd be easier for me to be able to do\nthis from my desk with my resources.\n\n310\n00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.110\nSo what I'll do is I'll just open your\nInbox on my Outlook account, right?\n\n311\n00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.400\nI'll just put that in there, do what I\nneed to do, make the changes I need to\n\n312\n00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.590\nmake, and then when I'm done\nI'll close it and put it back.\n\n313\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:08.210\nBut I didn't follow the correct\nchain of procedure, right?\n\n314\n00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.780\nI didn't put in a change request\nto say do I have access to this.\n\n315\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.390\nGet written formal approval from her and\n\n316\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.420\nher boss that I would have\naccess to those emails.\n\n317\n00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.460\nAnd when they found out I did,\nthey said you can't do that.\n\n318\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.990\nIf you do that again,\nthat's a breach of policy.\n\n319\n00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.770\nDon't do that again.\n\n320\n00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.070\nI was just trying to expediate things.\n\n321\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.620\nShe seemed very under\nthe gun about something.\n\n322\n00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.780\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n323\n00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.855\nAfter that, I didn't go to\nthe bathroom without a work order.\n\n324\n00:17:31.855 --> 00:17:34.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, I made sure every, and\n\n325\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.210\nthis is just words of wisdom,\nit's there to protect you.\n\n326\n00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.480\nThese implementations that Microsoft\nhas made for Office 365, for Azure,\n\n327\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.520\nwhich is their Enterprise\nlevel cloud services,\n\n328\n00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.550\nthey're there to keep them\nout of hot water, right?\n\n329\n00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.660\nSo they need to follow those procedures.\n\n330\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.830\nThey need to escalate and\n\n331\n00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:57.980\nmake sure there's a very explicit\nchain of events that happens and\n\n332\n00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.540\napprovals that occur so that if something\nhas happened, they didn't misstep.\n\n333\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.160\nYou gave them access to it, you approved\nit, and they can go back, and there's\n\n334\n00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.100\na paper trail that says you allowed me\nto do that so that's why we did it.\n\n335\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.220\nYou can't say that there's\nany wrongdoing on our side.\n\n336\n00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.630\nAnd then, on the opposite hand, if they\ndo do that without your permission,\n\n337\n00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.800\nyou can say you didn't fill out this form.\n\n338\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.980\nYou never requested approval from us.\n\n339\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.230\nSo they put those checks and\nbalances in there.\n\n340\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.550\nTo keep them and you safe keeping\nthat data very private and secure.\n\n341\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.170\n>> That had happened to me once\nworking for a company as well.\n\n342\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:35.140\nI had a manager called me up and\nsaid, I've got this employee here.\n\n343\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.490\nHe's forgot his password.\n\n344\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.660\nOr, not forgot his password.\n\n345\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.210\nHe wanted me to log the person in.\n\n346\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.350\nI was an administrator.\n\n347\n00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.760\nHe wanted me to log the person\nin under my credentials.\n\n348\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.910\nNow, see, I didn't have access\nto resetting passwords.\n\n349\n00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.650\nMy role had nothing to do with that,\n\n350\n00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.810\nso even though I maybe potentially could,\nthat wasn't my role.\n\n351\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.280\nAnd he called me up basically and\n\n352\n00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.350\nsaid I want you to log him in as you so\nhe can get his job done and\n\n353\n00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.190\nwe will get his password reset\non beginning of the work week.\n\n354\n00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:11.020\nWell I did, and\nthen it was found out right, auditing and\n\n355\n00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.280\nthat's what we're coming back here,\nextensive auditing and supervision.\n\n356\n00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.490\nThey were doing auditing.\n\n357\n00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.300\nThey were doing supervised,\nchecking logs and stuff.\n\n358\n00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:24.500\nAnd they found out that my credentials,\nWes, had logged in on a Saturday\n\n359\n00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:29.530\nfrom a workstation that was on\na sales floor, an administrator.\n\n360\n00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.160\nSo that right there, like you said,\n\n361\n00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.360\nthrow you under the bus,\nthrew me right under the bus as well.\n\n362\n00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.340\nSo the next time it happened, I said no.\n\n363\n00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.290\nNot at all.\n\n364\n00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:44.580\nIn fact, if you are the manager,\nthen you need to talk to your boss,\n\n365\n00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.870\nand I need some kind of formal written\nstatement that says you can change this.\n\n366\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.020\nAnd it was just something\nas simple as logging in.\n\n367\n00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.480\nNow you might say,\nwell why is that such a big deal?\n\n368\n00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.230\nImagine here at Microsoft,\nif one of their, and this is not the case,\n\n369\n00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.040\nthis is an imaginary situation here.\n\n370\n00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.750\n>> All hypothetical.\n\n371\n00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:06.840\n>> All hypothetical but could you imagine\na supervisor that has high level access to\n\n372\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.455\ncorporate information,\nthat a company can make millions or\n\n373\n00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:13.660\nlose millions of dollars an hour\nif they don't have access for it.\n\n374\n00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.230\nThey go in there,\nunsupervised, undocumented, and\n\n375\n00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.340\nsomething happens to that information\nwhere a good portion of it's wiped out.\n\n376\n00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.680\nWe have no paper trail, right?\n\n377\n00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.400\nWe have no way,\nif we're not doing auditing, if we're not\n\n378\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.690\nfollowing those policies and procedures,\nof finding out what caused that problem.\n\n379\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.930\nSo escalation process.\n\n380\n00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.310\nKeep in mind, very important,\nthat what it says if that if they\n\n381\n00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.460\ndo need access to your information other\nthan just providing you your services,\n\n382\n00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.450\nthey're gonna have to go through that\nprocess before they can get to it, and\n\n383\n00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.880\nthen they're also gonna audit and\ntrack every bit of that process.\n\n384\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.310\nAnd if you say I don't want you to\nhave access to my data they have to,\n\n385\n00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.150\nby contract, and\nwe'll get into some more of the legalities\n\n386\n00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:58.320\nlike SLA service level agreements,\nthat they can't access your information.\n\n387\n00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.620\nSo, they do maintain a good deal of,\nwhite papers,\n\n388\n00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.960\nif you will, information here at the trust\ncenter that you can find out that your\n\n389\n00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.470\ndata is going to remain safe and\nit's gonna remain private.\n\n390\n00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.290\nNow that's on their side, all right.\n\n391\n00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.950\nWhat do you have to do on your side?\n\n392\n00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.910\nAll right, remember,\nkind of like Dan was mentioning,\n\n393\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:23.890\nif you've got your company is extremely\nsecure, all right, then you're good to go.\n\n394\n00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.850\nYou're following security policies,\nyou're doing well.\n\n395\n00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:31.220\nWhat if you're working for a company that\nlooks at all of this information and says,\n\n396\n00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.410\nokay good we're safe, we're secure.\n\n397\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.322\nBut we don't implement our own\nprivacy controls that the platform,\n\n398\n00:21:37.322 --> 00:21:42.520\nthe API, the interface that you work with\nallows you to do, well then that's on you.\n\n399\n00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.670\nThat's not on them.\n\n400\n00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:49.075\nSo there is two sides of the that\nwe have to be very careful on\n\n401\n00:21:49.075 --> 00:21:55.940\nthat you don't consider Microsoft liable\nfor a misconfiguration on your part.\n\n402\n00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.640\nOr lack of due diligence for\nsecurity on your end of the interface.\n\n403\n00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.130\nNot implementing permissions.\n\n404\n00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.390\nNot doing role separation, right?\n\n405\n00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.980\nYou don't just let the junior,\njust got hired,\n\n406\n00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.490\nperson give the global\nadministrative role, and\n\n407\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.320\nthen wonder why your whole entire\ninterface or infrastructure's down.\n\n408\n00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.900\nSo you also have to do your part, and\nthat's one of the things that they mention\n\n409\n00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.710\nhere, privacy and\ncontrols enable you to configure.\n\n410\n00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:21.280\nYou.\n\n411\n00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.500\n>> So Microsoft's responsibility\nultimately only goes so far and\n\n412\n00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.220\nthen it's up to us.\n\n413\n00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.990\nIt says, just because we're going to the\ncloud doesn't mean our responsibilities as\n\n414\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.830\nadministrators have left us.\n\n415\n00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.490\nWe still have to implement certain\nsecurity policies as well.\n\n416\n00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.190\n>> You better believe it.\n\n417\n00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.170\nIt's called liability capping.\n\n418\n00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.860\nNot cappeting, capping, liability capping.\n\n419\n00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:45.830\nThe liability that Microsoft has for\nsome of these security problems, right?\n\n420\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.960\nThere again, think about this.\n\n421\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:53.450\nIf you have a service-level agreement with\na security monitoring system, all right?\n\n422\n00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.240\nYou say my place got broken into,\nall right?\n\n423\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.650\nSome things got stolen.\n\n424\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.720\nIt's your fault.\n\n425\n00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.740\nI pay you a service to monitor\nmy building and keep it secure.\n\n426\n00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.260\nSo they start doing a little bit of\nan audit and what do they find out.\n\n427\n00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.780\nYeah you who have a security system,\nbut one of your employees forgot to\n\n428\n00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:16.240\ntake the rubber door kick out of\nthe door and left for the night.\n\n429\n00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.690\nWell that's not the security\ncompany's fault.\n\n430\n00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.280\nIt's not the security company's fault that\nyour employee left the front door open.\n\n431\n00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.270\nYou can have all the security,\n$100,000 security system and\n\n432\n00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.980\na little rubber door stop\ncan ruin the whole thing.\n\n433\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.908\nSo don't do the little rubber doorstop\n[LAUGH] computer configurations in\n\n434\n00:23:31.908 --> 00:23:32.808\nthe Cloud here.\n\n435\n00:23:32.808 --> 00:23:35.390\nMake sure that you implement\nyour privacy controls.\n\n436\n00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:41.240\nSo, Dan, when it comes down to it,\nmanaging privacy of the data, fairly easy.\n\n437\n00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.750\nThree concepts to remember.\n\n438\n00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:48.260\nData ownership, read the information,\nknow what data is yours.\n\n439\n00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.130\nMicrosoft doesn't leave it hidden.\n\n440\n00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.050\nYou can find it.\n\n441\n00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.844\nKnow how they treat the information and\n\n442\n00:23:55.844 --> 00:24:00.225\nalso know what your responsibility\nis when it comes to privacy.\n\n443\n00:24:00.225 --> 00:24:04.286\n>> Awesome, now,\nwe'd be remiss if we did not talk or\n\n444\n00:24:04.286 --> 00:24:07.029\njump into the idea of Compliance.\n\n445\n00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:08.387\nWe're talking about privacy here.\n\n446\n00:24:08.387 --> 00:24:10.210\nAnd compliance is a huge part of that.\n\n447\n00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.460\nAnd when we say compliance, I'm thinking\nof things like HIPAA or Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\n448\n00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:18.770\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> These major medical and\n\n449\n00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.660\nfinancial institutions,\nthey have very strict guidelines\n\n450\n00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.398\nto how things must be maintained and\nkept private.\n\n451\n00:24:27.398 --> 00:24:30.150\nIt's a very big deal here\nin the United States.\n\n452\n00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.360\nI'm sure other countries have\ntheir own level of securities or\n\n453\n00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.863\ncompliance service for them as well,\nbut for here that's HIPAA and Sarbanes,\n\n454\n00:24:37.863 --> 00:24:41.720\nthat's the two that come to\nmy head usually very quickly.\n\n455\n00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.230\n>> Yep.\n\n456\n00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:47.200\n>> Can I use Cloud services if I need to\nbe, if I need some sort of compliance?\n\n457\n00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.436\n>> Okay so, this is gonna be\nan answer that, Dan, I know you hate.\n\n458\n00:24:50.436 --> 00:24:51.414\nYes and no.\n\n459\n00:24:51.414 --> 00:24:54.360\n[LAUGH] Those are always the worst.\n\n460\n00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.390\n>> Yeah.\n\n461\n00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.120\n>> You know.\nSo what this means for us is that yes,\n\n462\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.840\nin certain instances.\n\n463\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.540\nLet me give you the no right away\nbecause the majority of it's yes.\n\n464\n00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.750\nThe no is payment card information.\n\n465\n00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.160\nIt's PCI, DSS, standard data,\nsecurity standard, right?\n\n466\n00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.010\nThey don't, and\nthere's different levels of that standard.\n\n467\n00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.278\nThey don't secure you on\nall levels of the standard.\n\n468\n00:25:16.278 --> 00:25:20.710\nThey have what's known as a PCI, payment,\nsorry about the alphabet soup here.\n\n469\n00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:25.030\nPayment Card Industry\ndata security standard.\n\n470\n00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:25.760\n>> Very good sir.\n\n471\n00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.290\n>> Level 1.\n\n472\n00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:31.280\nAll right, they say that when\nit's on our servers, it's secure.\n\n473\n00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.660\nWe don't recommend the in transit.\n\n474\n00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.890\nNow, we're gonna get into the fact\nthat it is secure in transit, but for\n\n475\n00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.850\nthat security standard it doesn't\nmeet the standard, all right?\n\n476\n00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.010\nNow, that's really just some of the nos.\n\n477\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.030\nThe majority of it is yes.\n\n478\n00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:51.320\nIt meets not only the U.S. standards, but\nit also meets European standards, too.\n\n479\n00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.850\nCuz think about it, it's the Cloud.\n\n480\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.470\nIt could be anywhere, and\nyou can have multi, and they do.\n\n481\n00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:59.810\nIn fact, we talked about this in the first\nepisode that there are multinational\n\n482\n00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.190\ncompanies, just international companies,\n\n483\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.040\nright, major companies and\nthey're all over the world.\n\n484\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.030\nSo not only does it protect us here in\nthe US, it also has to comply with some\n\n485\n00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.710\nof the standards that are in\nthe European nations as well.\n\n486\n00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.050\nSo let's go ahead and look at that.\n\n487\n00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.770\nSee, we're still here at the trust center.\n\n488\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.960\nAnd one of the great things is,\nthey have a continuous compliance.\n\n489\n00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.250\nNow before I hit you with\nsome of the acronyms and\n\n490\n00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.260\nsome of the standards that you can\nsee let's just understand that\n\n491\n00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.820\nthis is one of the benefits\nof using the Cloud.\n\n492\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.260\nWe have talked about some of the drawbacks\nbetween using on premise and\n\n493\n00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.950\nbenefits of on premise.\n\n494\n00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:41.815\nOne of the drawbacks to On premise\nis that your team of security gurus,\n\n495\n00:26:41.815 --> 00:26:45.260\nthey're gonna have to constantly monitor\nsecurity compliance standards, right?\n\n496\n00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.605\nYour CISSPs right, they're gonna have\nto be very very smart in this stuff and\n\n497\n00:26:49.605 --> 00:26:51.385\nthey're gonna have, it's cyclic right.\n\n498\n00:26:51.385 --> 00:26:55.205\nIt's a revolving door, security is not\na destination to be reached only a journey\n\n499\n00:26:55.205 --> 00:26:56.265\nto be travelled upon right.\n\n500\n00:26:56.265 --> 00:26:59.940\nSo it always is changing and\nthey're gonna have to stay up to date.\n\n501\n00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.610\nNow with using a platform like for\ninstance Azure, we've been talking about\n\n502\n00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:09.420\nAzure before we started here, platform is\na service, infrastructure is a service.\n\n503\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:14.590\nIf I off load that and even software as\na service to Microsoft then guess what?\n\n504\n00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:15.260\nMy staff,\n\n505\n00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.280\nour staff doesn't have to worry about\nthe ever-changing security standards.\n\n506\n00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.640\nNow, what we still have to worry about\nis an in-house security policy and\n\n507\n00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.715\nwe just have to make sure that our\nsecurity policy matches the standards that\n\n508\n00:27:26.715 --> 00:27:28.330\nwe're going to talk about right here.\n\n509\n00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.090\nAnd that's one of the great\nthings about this,\n\n510\n00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.560\nis that they do fall under compliance.\n\n511\n00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.860\nNow there are a few different\nways that they do this, okay?\n\n512\n00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:41.400\nOne of the things is\nthird-party verification.\n\n513\n00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.940\nMicrosoft goes to\nindependent verification.\n\n514\n00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.620\nNot why is the answer right?\n\n515\n00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.850\nBecause I told you it was right.\n\n516\n00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:49.720\nNot that.\n\n517\n00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.630\nWhy is it right?\n\n518\n00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.290\nWell, because we had three or four, five,\n\n519\n00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.600\nsix hundred individuals\nthat don't work for us.\n\n520\n00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.100\nConfirm it over and over.\n\n521\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.010\nAnd we can see that right here.\n\n522\n00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.880\nIf we check this out\nindependent verification.\n\n523\n00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.900\nAll right, there's some,\nyeah there's HIPAA there.\n\n524\n00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:04.980\nThe one that Dan mentioned.\n\n525\n00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:10.920\nAnd we've got some other ones,\nthe European Union, model clauses, ISO,\n\n526\n00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.670\nthe 27001 and\nthere's a whole bunch of them, 2 to 18 and\n\n527\n00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:20.750\nstuff, that is one of\nthe best worldwide industry\n\n528\n00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.870\nstandards set by the International\nOrganization for Standardization, right.\n\n529\n00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.710\nAt nine bodies, nine or\nten bodies that are a part of that.\n\n530\n00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.307\nThat's international.\n\n531\n00:28:29.307 --> 00:28:33.336\nSo it doesn't mean that if I, okay so\nwe've got HIPAA compliance here in\n\n532\n00:28:33.336 --> 00:28:37.169\nthe United States, so if i store my\ninformation on servers that are,\n\n533\n00:28:37.169 --> 00:28:40.180\ndata is located here on the U.S.\nI'm safe right?\n\n534\n00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.250\nBut then, well wait a second,\nwhat if my data is stored\n\n535\n00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.570\nin a location that's in another country,\non foreign soil,\n\n536\n00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.730\nand i mean foreign soil to us because\nwe're here in the United States,\n\n537\n00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.550\nif you're in another country the United\nStates might be foreign soil to you.\n\n538\n00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.410\nSo, now whose laws do we go by?\n\n539\n00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:59.170\nWell, we might not be following our\nhealth care information protection act,\n\n540\n00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.990\nI can't remember the whole\nacronym on that one.\n\n541\n00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.450\nBut now, we're going to be\nfollowing other models, right?\n\n542\n00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.670\nAnd that's where the ISO and the\nEuropean Union model clauses come in and\n\n543\n00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.770\nthey follow under that.\n\n544\n00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.460\nNow understand that when they talk about\ntheir data processing agreement, details,\n\n545\n00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.820\nprivacy, security handling, all right.\n\n546\n00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.840\nAll of that is controlled by them,\nall right.\n\n547\n00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.240\nNow they also take the,\nremember, I was talking about,\n\n548\n00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.220\nyour security staff is going to have to\nmaintain the upkeep, they're gonna have to\n\n549\n00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.900\nmaintain their knowledge and keep updating\nthat knowledge and security compliance.\n\n550\n00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:37.880\nWell they've got a proactive approach and\nyou know what, leave it to them.\n\n551\n00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.790\nThey tell you right here we've got\n900 controls in the Office compliance\n\n552\n00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:44.850\nframework right,\nthat enable them, not you,\n\n553\n00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:50.150\nnot your team to stay up to date with look\nat this, ever evolving industry standards.\n\n554\n00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:50.880\nRight?\n\n555\n00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.730\nIndustry standards change\nlike athletes change socks.\n\n556\n00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.040\nUnless they think dirty socks are lucky.\n\n557\n00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.453\nThen, maybe they don't change them.\n\n558\n00:29:57.453 --> 00:29:58.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n559\n00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:02.975\nThey have a specialist\ncompliance team that their whole\n\n560\n00:30:02.975 --> 00:30:07.755\nexistence is to track these standards and\nregulations and\n\n561\n00:30:07.755 --> 00:30:14.315\nthen come back as a Dev team, and develop\na control set to meet the compliance.\n\n562\n00:30:14.315 --> 00:30:15.595\nSo, very, very good here.\n\n563\n00:30:15.595 --> 00:30:19.035\nCustomer controls, well, you're not\nout of the water, either, right?\n\n564\n00:30:19.035 --> 00:30:22.800\nMicrosoft is doing due diligence,\nthey're taking care of their part.\n\n565\n00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.200\nYou still have to take care\nof your part too, all right.\n\n566\n00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.070\nSo they give you legal hold,\neDiscovery and stuff.\n\n567\n00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:33.710\nNow legal hold is, you guys probably,\nsome of you might be familiar with certain\n\n568\n00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.560\ndocuments have to be kept for\na while, right?\n\n569\n00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.960\nWell they've good ways\nthat you can do that.\n\n570\n00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.430\nYou can preserve and\nanalyze your data, you also have DLP.\n\n571\n00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.050\nAnd that's something that's really\ngood when it comes to organizational\n\n572\n00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:47.370\ncompliance, meeting these standards\nis having data loss protection.\n\n573\n00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.210\nMonitoring and\nprotecting sensitive information.\n\n574\n00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.360\nAll right, and what they do through\nthat deep content analysis.\n\n575\n00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.480\nSo you do have that.\n\n576\n00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:59.180\nOne of the things I do\nwant to show you here,\n\n577\n00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.880\nlet me see if I can find\nit fairly quickly here.\n\n578\n00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.860\nIs that, they have a good website.\n\n579\n00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.080\nIt's all linked to the trust center here.\n\n580\n00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.210\nAnd let me see where I put that.\n\n581\n00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:14.985\nThere we go, cuz I wanna show you some\nof the compliance standards that Dan was\n\n582\n00:31:14.985 --> 00:31:15.650\nmentioning.\n\n583\n00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:16.610\nAnd do they hit them?\n\n584\n00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.020\nWell, they do.\nAnd these are just,\n\n585\n00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.890\nthis is just the top of the stack,\ntop ten compliance standards.\n\n586\n00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.550\nThere are a bunch of them, guys.\n\n587\n00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.060\nAnd I don't wanna bore you with\nall the intricate details, but\n\n588\n00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.430\nI will put these links so\nthat you can look at them.\n\n589\n00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:34.420\nSo if that's something that you have\nto consider, is your company compliant?\n\n590\n00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.430\nCan I use this to keep\nhealthcare information?\n\n591\n00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.950\nThink about it.\n\n592\n00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.270\nIf you are developing an app and it's\nin the Cloud, you might be a contractor\n\n593\n00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:46.450\nworking with a medical facility, well you\nhave to find out is it HIPAA compliant?\n\n594\n00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:47.330\nWell it says there.\n\n595\n00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.340\nDOPs, data processing agreements.\n\n596\n00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:54.310\nThe other thing that I didn't mention\nabout Microsoft being a custodian is they\n\n597\n00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:59.620\nhave a clear cut data processing policy\nthat you read, you sign and agree to so\n\n598\n00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:03.770\nthat you can see transparent to you\nwhat they're gonna do with the data.\n\n599\n00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.020\nAnd then some, what was that\nother one that you mentioned Dan?\n\n600\n00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.350\n>> Sarbanes-Oxley\n>> Okay, okay.\n\n601\n00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.925\nGod bless you.\n\n602\n00:32:08.925 --> 00:32:11.090\n[LAUGH] But you can see,\n\n603\n00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.230\nyou could see that it's not\njust here on the stage right.\n\n604\n00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.780\nThere's the two right that I was talking\nabout, ISO which is international and\n\n605\n00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.970\nyou could see it's one of the best, Dave\nmentioned as this being the best security\n\n606\n00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.710\nbenchmark for standards internationally\nand then the European Union.\n\n607\n00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.370\nSo we do have, and there's,\nhere's one for Canada as well.\n\n608\n00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.480\nSo you know,\nif your own Canadian soil too.\n\n609\n00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.010\nOr maybe you've got a company\nthat again is international and\n\n610\n00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.440\nmaybe it's some here in the states.\n\n611\n00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.110\nEuropean nations and in Canada,\nyou're gonna be protected.\n\n612\n00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.990\nSo when it comes down to it,\nwith all the acronyms and\n\n613\n00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.170\nall the standards, Dan,\nyour data should meet the compliance.\n\n614\n00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:48.640\nNow that doesn't mean that your\ninternal policy meets that.\n\n615\n00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.920\nWhen you set an internal policy you might\nhave something that says we've gotta\n\n616\n00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.830\nkeep a portion of the data on site.\n\n617\n00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.270\nAnd that's gonna be up to you but\n\n618\n00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.850\non Microsoft's end they do\nmeet a lot of those standards.\n\n619\n00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:59.924\n>> Awesome.\nWell obviously Microsoft is,\n\n620\n00:32:59.924 --> 00:33:01.220\nwell they have our back, right?\n\n621\n00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.980\nThey're trying to make sure that their\nsystems, whatever you're accessing,\n\n622\n00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.570\nwhatever you're storing data on, whatever\nthey're giving you a service to, is\n\n623\n00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:13.620\nat least, on their end, meeting compliance\nfor many, many different things.\n\n624\n00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.140\nAnd keeping your data\nas private as possible.\n\n625\n00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.735\nWe thank you very much Mr. Bill Gates for\ncreating such a wonderful company.\n\n626\n00:33:19.735 --> 00:33:20.350\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> All right, Wes,\n\n627\n00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.360\nis there anything else we need\nto know before we call it a day?\n\n628\n00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.890\n>> Well, I tell you,\nwe've got a bunch more so, unfortunately,\n\n629\n00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:28.590\nwell fortunately,\nwe can't fit it all on this one.\n\n630\n00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.650\nI think we're going to have to go\nto a part two on this one Dan, so\n\n631\n00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.460\nI do have more, but\n\n632\n00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.220\nfor now just understand you own your data,\nyou can maintain the privacy,\n\n633\n00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:40.080\nMicrosoft has compliant standards\nas well as privacy policies.\n\n634\n00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.600\nCheck them out at\nthe Microsoft Office Trust Center.\n\n635\n00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.640\n>> Awesome, thank you so much for joining\nus today Wes, we look forward to part two.\n\n636\n00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.210\nHopefully you do as well.\n\n637\n00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.100\nThank you for watching, we're going\nto go ahead and sign off for

They start by explaining what level of trust you can have with Microsoft as your cloud service provider; maintaining the integrity of your data when in the hands of a third party and transparency of operations with said party. They also describe some of the security tactics used to protect your data when it is either sitting at rest on a server or traveling across the internet.",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.457\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:19.457 --> 00:00:22.740\nwe're continuing on with our\nseries on cloud fundamentals.\n\n5\n00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.150\nJoining me again, today,\nis none other than Mister Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.340\nWes, welcome to the show.\n\n7\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.160\nGlad to have you here.\n\n8\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.720\nHow you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.770\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.610\nIt's great to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.780\nAnd, we're moving into Part Two of\nthe Cloud Security and Principles.\n\n12\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.930\nYup, that's right, as always I talked\nway too much in the first one,\n\n13\n00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840\nand we didn't get through everything.\n\n14\n00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.370\n>> We were jabberjaws.\n\n15\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.520\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n16\n00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.540\nSo we're gonna be moving on into\nthe next portion of this now.\n\n17\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.400\nLet me take a second to recap what we had\ntalked about in the first portion of this\n\n18\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.590\nepisode, so that if you're not familiar\nwith it, we'll catch you up to speed.\n\n19\n00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.870\nAnd you can always go back and\nwatch that first portion.\n\n20\n00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.750\nRemember, one of the first things that\nwe had talked about was privacy, right?\n\n21\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.450\nPrivacy's very important when you're gonna\nbe storing data inside of the cloud.\n\n22\n00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.440\nWe also looked at things like Microsoft's,\nwhat Microsoft lays out for\n\n23\n00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.350\nthem being the custodians of\nthe information and then,\n\n24\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.830\nas well as what data is yours and\nthat's again, very, very important when\n\n25\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.200\nyou're gonna have information that's\ngonna be stored in the cloud.\n\n26\n00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200\nYou wanna make sure that\nit maintains privacy.\n\n27\n00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.997\nThen, we also talked about compliance and\n\n28\n00:01:25.997 --> 00:01:32.120\nsome of the international standards that\nthe Office 365 platform does support.\n\n29\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.750\nNow, one of the other things that goes\nalong with that is data transparency,\n\n30\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.500\noperations transparency, and they kinda\njust lump it all together, data and\n\n31\n00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.530\noperations transparency.\n\n32\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.050\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\n33\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.290\nWell, think about it this way.\n\n34\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.310\nYour data is your intellectual property,\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.380\nAnd when you store that\ninformation in their servers,\n\n36\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.410\none of the things that you might do\none of these days is come calling for\n\n37\n00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.960\nthat information, and\nwanna know where are they storing it?\n\n38\n00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.340\nAre they moving it around?\n\n39\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.650\nAnd if they're moving it around,\n\n40\n00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.700\nwell, I might have to be worried\nabout compliance standards.\n\n41\n00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.350\nI need to know, am I currently following,\nmaybe that EU Model Clause, or\n\n42\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.980\nare we following HIPAA?\n\n43\n00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.540\nBecause as it moves through\ndifferent locations,\n\n44\n00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.626\nyou wanna be aware of what standards\nthe data is falling under.\n\n45\n00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:22.520\nSo, they also give some\npretty good documentation\n\n46\n00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.060\non the Office 365 Trust Center on,\nand I say Office 365, it's all around.\n\n47\n00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.640\nIt's just the Office Trust Center\nthat you can go and look, and\n\n48\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.910\nyou can find this out as well.\n\n49\n00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.420\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n50\n00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.735\nLet's talk about some\ntransparent operations.\n\n51\n00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:42.050\nNow,one of the things that I\nknow that I might want to use or\n\n52\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.450\nbe able to verify is that\nare you working with my data?\n\n53\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.370\nAnd if you're working with my data,\ncan I call you up right now?\n\n54\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.420\nOr if I don't call you up, do you have\na platform or a method that I can look and\n\n55\n00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.620\nI want to know exactly what's going\non with my data right then and there?\n\n56\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.630\nAnd we can do that.\n\n57\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.110\nSo let's go ahead and look.\n\n58\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.420\nLet's talk about the transparent\noperations from Office 365.\n\n59\n00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.490\nAnd I've actually pulled\nthat up right here.\n\n60\n00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.660\nAnd they do give you, like we mentioned\nin the first portion of this episode,\n\n61\n00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.180\nplenty of documentation that you can find.\n\n62\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.190\nOne of the things that we might\nwanna look at is data location and\n\n63\n00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.330\nthat's one of the first\nthings that you can do here.\n\n64\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.824\nAll right, so one of the things that\nyou'll see is that they do manage things\n\n65\n00:03:24.824 --> 00:03:26.910\nlike multiple copies of your data.\n\n66\n00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.190\nThey do this obviously for\nfault tolerance and redundancy.\n\n67\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.010\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more\nabout that because they do have that\n\n68\n00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.300\nmultiple nine approach that we'll look at.\n\n69\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.820\nAnd that's the uptime,\nor what is the minimum\n\n70\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.270\nacceptable downtime in a single year that\nyou can expect from using their service.\n\n71\n00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.200\nNow, they also tell you we can tell\nyou who has access to your data and\n\n72\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.850\nunder what circumstances.\n\n73\n00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.300\nNow, we covered that pretty\nheavily in the first episode.\n\n74\n00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.218\nSo we don't have to really\ntouch too much on that one.\n\n75\n00:04:01.218 --> 00:04:05.577\nIf you want more information, though, they\ndo have, you can click on this link and\n\n76\n00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:09.754\nit will take you over to the Microsoft\nOnline Services documentation where they\n\n77\n00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:12.050\nreally break it down into lawyer speak.\n\n78\n00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.772\nI was gonna say geek speak.\n\n79\n00:04:12.772 --> 00:04:13.959\nWe love geek speak here.\n\n80\n00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.979\nBut lawyer speak,\nlot of conditional clauses and\n\n81\n00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.390\nstuff that you have to get through there.\n\n82\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.980\nAgain it is fairly open.\n\n83\n00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.890\nNow how about this.\n\n84\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.590\nI wanna know where my data is located.\n\n85\n00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.260\nNow you say, well I know where\nmy data is located, right?\n\n86\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.820\nIt's located in the cloud.\n\n87\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.860\nRight, well where is that\ndata physically located?\n\n88\n00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.350\nWell, we can see that here as well and\nthis one is actually a very,\n\n89\n00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.890\nvery cool website.\n\n90\n00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.700\nIf we click on this,\nit takes us out to hey, imagine that.\n\n91\n00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.300\nWhere's my data?\n\n92\n00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.650\nThis is a very neat,\nI kinda like this one, Dan.\n\n93\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.910\nAnd I think, we were talking off screen.\n\n94\n00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.100\nYou've actually seen this before when\nyou're doing Azure and everything.\n\n95\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.940\nOr Azure shows.\n\n96\n00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.850\nSelect Your Region.\n\n97\n00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.530\nI wanna know.\n\n98\n00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.610\nWell, before I do that, you can see\nright away all of the locations.\n\n99\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.860\nThis look is by country, really.\n\n100\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.860\nYou can see that yes, this is North\nAmerica here, this is the United States,\n\n101\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.700\nand South America and Brazil.\n\n102\n00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.850\nAlright, so you can see that these\ndata centers are spread out,\n\n103\n00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.360\nwith South Korea here.\n\n104\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.020\nHey, we got some down there in Australia,\nas well, and Malaysia.\n\n105\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.470\nSo, all over the place, Austria, Finland.\n\n106\n00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.350\nWell, I'm not located in Finland.\n\n107\n00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.230\nI wanna know where my data's located for\nmy region.\n\n108\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.570\nAnd that's one of the great things about\nthis website here is you can select\n\n109\n00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.650\nwhatever region is\npertinent to your network.\n\n110\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.070\n>> So Wes, with Office 365,\n\n111\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.810\nI don't have the ability to select\nwhich region my data is stored in.\n\n112\n00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.120\nI'm in a region, and\n\n113\n00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.180\nwhen I create an account that's\nthe region that that data goes into.\n\n114\n00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.130\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n115\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.690\nJust like coming up in this series,\n\n116\n00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.610\nwe're going to show you how to\nselect the location for your domain.\n\n117\n00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.520\nAll right, when you set up your account\nfor Office 365, you set up your attendant.\n\n118\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.110\nYou configure your administrators.\n\n119\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.040\nAnd which we are gonna show you\nall this and how to do this.\n\n120\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.580\nYou also set the location for your domain.\n\n121\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.720\nThe location that you set is going to be\ndirectly related to where it's located in\n\n122\n00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.900\nthe data centers across the world.\n\n123\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.970\nAll right, so if I select my region\nhere and we go to North America.\n\n124\n00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.490\nNotice that it's zoomed in,\neven though on that first introductory\n\n125\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.800\npage it looked like, hey, we're just\ntalking about one little data center\n\n126\n00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.220\ninside of North America, you can see\nthat's really far from of the truth here.\n\n127\n00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.830\nAnd one of the things that I like,\nDan, about this\n\n128\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.990\nwebsite here is that all I have to do\nis hover over one of the data centers.\n\n129\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.553\nI don't have to click anything,\njust hover over it.\n\n130\n00:06:35.553 --> 00:06:40.269\nAnd it tells me the location,\nbut more importantly for\n\n131\n00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:45.100\nme, what portion of the service\nis storing data there.\n\n132\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.882\nAll right, and you can see this down\nthe right-hand side here, like at the top.\n\n133\n00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:51.424\nWhat is this Washington, up here, Quincy.\n\n134\n00:06:51.424 --> 00:06:56.405\nIt tells me that there's Azure Active\nDirectory Services are stored in this data\n\n135\n00:06:56.405 --> 00:06:57.470\ncenter.\n\n136\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.490\nIt tells me Exchange Online,\nSharePoint, Skype for business.\n\n137\n00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.100\nSo, that's one thing to understand, that\nwhen you're using the Office 365 software\n\n138\n00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.900\nas a service, you're not just using,\npotentially, for your company,\n\n139\n00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.220\nwhatever your company purchases,\nyou're not just using a single service.\n\n140\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.260\nAnd there again, if you purchase Azure and\nyou're using that cloud based solution,\n\n141\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.630\nagain it's platform as a service, and\n\n142\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.850\ninfrastructure as a service\nall combined into one.\n\n143\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.032\nYou can see not every service is going to\nstore its information in the various data\n\n144\n00:07:28.032 --> 00:07:30.030\ncenters around North America here.\n\n145\n00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.270\nSo for instance,\nif I hover over, what is that?\n\n146\n00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.250\nDes Moines?\n\n147\n00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.860\n>> Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n148\n00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.080\n>> Des Moines.\n\n149\n00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.490\nI can see that Yammer's here.\n\n150\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.860\nI can see Skype for business, but I really\nwant to look at the one here in Virginia.\n\n151\n00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.511\nLet's see if I can get it.\n\n152\n00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.302\nThere we go, Harrisonburg.\n\n153\n00:07:47.302 --> 00:07:50.306\nNotice that the only thing that's\nstored in that data center,\n\n154\n00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:51.447\nnotice it says Yammer.\n\n155\n00:07:51.447 --> 00:07:54.856\nAll right, so\nyour data could be dispersed,\n\n156\n00:07:54.856 --> 00:07:58.184\nall right, across multiple data centers.\n\n157\n00:07:58.184 --> 00:08:02.293\nEven if you're just using, we only\nsee it through one single interface.\n\n158\n00:08:02.293 --> 00:08:05.803\nI know that I am using Office web apps,\nI know that I am using PowerPoint,\n\n159\n00:08:05.803 --> 00:08:09.350\nI know that I am using Skype, I know\nthat I am using the Embe potentially.\n\n160\n00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.270\nBut the data is not stored\nin a single location.\n\n161\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.890\nIt's spread out.\n\n162\n00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.760\nIt's very geographically dispersed\nhere and you can see that.\n\n163\n00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.720\nAnd you could see that sway here as well.\n\n164\n00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.240\nNow it also gives you\ninformation down here,\n\n165\n00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.130\nif you wanna know more\nspecific information.\n\n166\n00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:30.120\nI don't wanna just know\none single data center.\n\n167\n00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.490\nI wanna know all the data centers.\n\n168\n00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.810\nAnd I wanna know where they're located.\n\n169\n00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:34.460\nSo we can do that.\n\n170\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.720\nAnd again, you can switch to\nthe different regions here.\n\n171\n00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.110\nYou can also do Office\n365 Government Plans.\n\n172\n00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.700\nAs we get into talking about different\nplans that you have as well,\n\n173\n00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.550\nyou can you can rearrange this.\n\n174\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.285\nAnd notice that it does change it up.\n\n175\n00:08:49.285 --> 00:08:52.930\nSo this can even be used\n\n176\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.090\nmore in a government level as well,\nand you can see that information.\n\n177\n00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.460\nSo it's really good to know\nwhere the information is stored\n\n178\n00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.590\nat any time if you need to.\n\n179\n00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.580\n>> So my Skype for business data will\nnever be in that Virginia location\n\n180\n00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.250\nbecause that Virginia\nlocation only does Yammer.\n\n181\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.350\nSo, I can understand,\nwhy would I want to spread this out?\n\n182\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.410\nWhat's the benefit, I guess, Wes,\nis the idea that will come to the mind,\n\n183\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.890\nthe question that is being begged.\n\n184\n00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:26.150\nWhat's the benefit of spreading those\nservices out to different geolocations?\n\n185\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.630\n>> That's a good thing.\n\n186\n00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.720\nSo when we talk about on premise,\n\n187\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.850\none of the things that we did\nwhen we introduced this series,\n\n188\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.770\nwe talked about having to have things like\ndisaster recovery plans in place, right?\n\n189\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.100\nAnd one of the things you do with DRPs in\nyour disaster recovery policies is you\n\n190\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.200\ndictate on site, off site locations.\n\n191\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.970\nWell why do you have to have on site and\noff site locations?\n\n192\n00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.110\nWell I want you to think about this.\n\n193\n00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.300\nIn a disaster situation, if something goes\nwrong with your on premise data center,\n\n194\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.600\nwherever it's located,\n\n195\n00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.220\nthat data center goes offline\nyou lose all your information.\n\n196\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.580\nYour business is put to a halt, right?\n\n197\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.900\nUnless you've got another location, right?\n\n198\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.340\nIf you've got an offsite location for\n\n199\n00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.330\nthose, or they call it things like\nhot sites and warm sites, right?\n\n200\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:12.180\nI've got another location that is\nready to go either immediately,\n\n201\n00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.900\nor maybe with a little work, and\n\n202\n00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.050\nthat's what really differentiates the\ntemperatures there, I have to maintain it.\n\n203\n00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.950\nWell here in the cloud,\nkeep in mind that's one of the benefits of\n\n204\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.670\nusing platform and infrastructure and\nsoftware as a service.\n\n205\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.140\nThey're managing that redundancy, right?\n\n206\n00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.900\nThey wanna make sure that you have a\ncertain level of access according to your\n\n207\n00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.260\nservice level agreement to your data\nat any given time during the year.\n\n208\n00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:43.820\nSo that is one of the purposes of having\nit geographically dispersed like that,\n\n209\n00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.730\nso that if one of those data centers\nwere to go down, for whatever reason,\n\n210\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.600\nyou still have other locations that\nhave multiple copies of your data, so\n\n211\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.020\nthat the data still remains available.\n\n212\n00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.850\nRight?\nWe've been talking about security when it\n\n213\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.440\ncomes to this episode here.\n\n214\n00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.500\nAnd one of the things we always\nhave to remember in security,\n\n215\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.400\none of the basic principles is\na little acronym called CIA.\n\n216\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.450\nConfidentiality we talked about that\nthrough things like privacy policies,\n\n217\n00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.220\nand we'll look a little bit more at some\nof the physical security that you can go\n\n218\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.560\ninto as well.\n\n219\n00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.340\nIntegrity, maintaining, you know,\nthe data maintains its original state.\n\n220\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.980\nBut that last one, that A, right?\n\n221\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.310\nThe A is really important and\nthat's availability.\n\n222\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.740\nMicrosoft gives you\na high ability rating so\n\n223\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.420\nthat you have access to your information.\n\n224\n00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.080\nAnd you can actually see that\navailability rating right here.\n\n225\n00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.630\nNow let me be careful and\njust make sure I state this.\n\n226\n00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.290\nThese numbers are not what\nMicrosoft offers you.\n\n227\n00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.210\nYou say, well, wait a second here.\n\n228\n00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.760\nThat's a sleight of hand.\n\n229\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.900\nNo it's not.\n\n230\n00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.480\nThese numbers are higher than\nthe level that they guarantee you.\n\n231\n00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.884\nAll right, what they guarantee\nyou is a 39, I believe it is.\n\n232\n00:11:52.884 --> 00:11:56.553\nIt's a 99.9% uptime, all right.\n\n233\n00:11:56.553 --> 00:12:01.187\nThe highest level uptime any company can\nreally give you, and I haven't seen this,\n\n234\n00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:05.051\nand in fact I don't even think Amazon\ndoes it, is five nines, right?\n\n235\n00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:08.920\nFive nines means there's no more than five\nminutes, it's actually four minutes and\n\n236\n00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.647\nchange, just close to five minutes.\n\n237\n00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:14.290\nNo more than five minutes downtime\nin any given point in the year.\n\n238\n00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:19.350\nAlright well,\nthat's about the most they can ever,\n\n239\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.090\nany one company can ever give you.\n\n240\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.620\nYou add one more nine to that and\nit's seconds in a year and\n\n241\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.799\ncompanies just don't\nhave that availability.\n\n242\n00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:32.927\nSo what Microsoft is telling you here\nis that we give you 99.9% up time.\n\n243\n00:12:32.927 --> 00:12:34.422\nAll right.\nWe'll they're giving you four nines here.\n\n244\n00:12:34.422 --> 00:12:39.839\nThey're telling you that even though\nour service level agreement and\n\n245\n00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:45.160\nour guarantee to you is that\nyou're going to get 99.9% up time,\n\n246\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.024\nwe actually achieved in quarter\none 99.99% up times, so\n\n247\n00:12:50.024 --> 00:12:53.810\nthey've actually exceeded\nwhat their SLA is.\n\n248\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.526\n>> So they underpromse and\noverdeliver, really.\n\n249\n00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.720\n>> Very good.\nWell put, that's exactly what it it is.\n\n250\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.200\nWe're gonna tell you we're\ngonna give you this and\n\n251\n00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.993\nwe're gonna strive to give you much more.\n\n252\n00:13:01.993 --> 00:13:05.964\nYou know, as far to your access to\nyour information, and that's good.\n\n253\n00:13:05.964 --> 00:13:08.775\nAnd back to your original question,\nDan, and that's one of the reasons that\n\n254\n00:13:08.775 --> 00:13:11.560\ninformation's gonna be stored\nin multiple data centers.\n\n255\n00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.350\nTo make sure of that.\n\n256\n00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.520\nWe'll talk about the physical security\ncoming up as well, but they have\n\n257\n00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.790\na lot of checks and balances that go into\nplace into any one single data center.\n\n258\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.478\nLet alone all their data centers\nacross the entire world.\n\n259\n00:13:26.478 --> 00:13:29.890\n>> Yeah, I can't imagine Microsoft\ndoing a very good business if\n\n260\n00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.260\neverything goes down all the time.\n\n261\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.910\nPeople are gonna be like,\nhey, you know what?\n\n262\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.380\nI was gonna use Office 365,\n\n263\n00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.970\nbut it's not very reliable so\nI'm gonna use something else.\n\n264\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.130\nThat's why they strive for these levels\nof availability and durability, right?\n\n265\n00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.400\n>> It really is, too, and Dan,\n\n266\n00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.320\nyou had mentioned this in one of\nthe previous episodes in this series that\n\n267\n00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.650\nsaid, hey, MIcrosoft's one of\nthe big boys on the block, right?\n\n268\n00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.520\nJust rhetorically speaking, they're\na big company with a lot of capital.\n\n269\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.500\nWell, they're spending billions on\ntheir cloud infrastructure, and\n\n270\n00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:06.500\nyou don't spend billions to not get\na return on your investment, for sure.\n\n271\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.290\nSo they definitely do their job there.\n\n272\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.720\nAnd if they don't, we'll get into another\nportion of this series on what it means to\n\n273\n00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.490\nyou when they reimburse you for\ndowntime that's unexpected.\n\n274\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.460\nSo they have that in there too,\nso they protect you on that.\n\n275\n00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.770\nNow the other thing too is,\nI wanna know where my information is.\n\n276\n00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:26.410\nOK?\nWell, if you\n\n277\n00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.450\nwanna know where your information is,\nwho do we talk to?\n\n278\n00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.530\nAll right, now I could set myself up for\na bad 80s reference and say,\n\n279\n00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:37.230\nwho you gonna call, but I will do that.\n\n280\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.640\n[LAUGH] they give you\nthe ability to talk to a human.\n\n281\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.700\nAnd that's one of the things I\nlike about this second point here\n\n282\n00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.650\non transparency of operations here,\nis support with a human face.\n\n283\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.580\nNow, I don't know if they're\ndoing video conferencing.\n\n284\n00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.210\n>> Probably Skyping.\n\n285\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.240\n>> Or Skype, but most likely they're\ngoing to be doing that and it's 24/7.\n\n286\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:04.290\nIf you're a customer, their customer\nsupport is absolutely amazing,\n\n287\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:09.210\nand you can see some videos out there as\nwell where senior product developers will\n\n288\n00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:14.080\ntell you that they want you to\nbe happy with your service.\n\n289\n00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.900\nThey want you to know that as\npart of your service, in fact,\n\n290\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.700\nthey're gonna to try to give\nme some support right now.\n\n291\n00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.700\nThey want you to know that if you\ncall you're gonna to get a human,\n\n292\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:28.670\nyou're not going to get some\nautomated text or automated system\n\n293\n00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.590\nwhere you're gonna have to press one, then\npress two, then press the pound symbol.\n\n294\n00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.030\nAnd before you know it, you're\nreprogramming the whole entire software\n\n295\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.220\njust by how many buttons you\nhave to push on the phone.\n\n296\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.790\nThey also got development processes,\nand they talk about escalation that\n\n297\n00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:50.740\nthey will do with the development team if\nan issue can't be resolved over the phone.\n\n298\n00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.428\nWhen you're looking, hey you know\nI come calling where's my data?\n\n299\n00:15:55.428 --> 00:15:57.390\nWell we can't give you that\ninformation right now or\n\n300\n00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.046\nwe don't have access to that information.\n\n301\n00:15:59.046 --> 00:15:59.978\nYou can get support.\n\n302\n00:15:59.978 --> 00:16:01.444\nYou know somebody on the phone there.\n\n303\n00:16:01.444 --> 00:16:06.185\nAnd if they can't resolve it\nvia phone support they do have\n\n304\n00:16:06.185 --> 00:16:09.170\nan escalation process.\n\n305\n00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.550\nNow one of the great things here too\n\n306\n00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:15.850\nis not only are they gonna tell\nyou where your information is, one\n\n307\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.640\nof the things that they will do is they\nwill also hold themselves accountable.\n\n308\n00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.710\nAll right.\n\n309\n00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.930\nAnd this is where we get into that uptime\nmeasurement that I was just talking about.\n\n310\n00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.410\nAnd you can see down here\nthat it says 99%, you can see\n\n311\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.310\nthe various things that they've reported\nover the last couple years, and\n\n312\n00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.910\nthere are different quarters here.\n\n313\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.985\nBut notice what they commit to, all right?\n\n314\n00:16:35.985 --> 00:16:40.480\n99%, I keep saying that 99.9% up time and\n\n315\n00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.040\nit is financially backed.\n\n316\n00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.970\nAgain, we'll get into the guarantees\nbecause we do have to look at that as\n\n317\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.570\npart of the MTA Cloud fundamentals exam.\n\n318\n00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.220\nYou have to know about\nidentifying guarantees and\n\n319\n00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.830\nwhat the service level agreements mean for\nyou.\n\n320\n00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.830\nSo we can see that here as well.\n\n321\n00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:02.300\nNow one of the things I also wanna\nmention too, I had been talking, Dan,\n\n322\n00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.800\nabout hey you can go over and\nyou can check this out.\n\n323\n00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.520\nLet's go ahead and\n\n324\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.790\njust real briefly let me show you\nthe online services documentation.\n\n325\n00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.300\nIt's gonna read like stereo instructions,\nguys, but it's thoroughly documented so\n\n326\n00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.400\nyou're aware.\n\n327\n00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.920\nAnd if we look that up,\nwho has access to your data?\n\n328\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.450\nNow we talked about it a little bit but\n\n329\n00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:26.920\nwhat I didn't go into too much\nhere is the online services.\n\n330\n00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.800\nHere is that documentation.\n\n331\n00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.690\nAnd you can find this,\nit's www.microsoft.com/legal and then you\n\n332\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:38.880\ncan find full information, I mean and you\ncan see they really, really lay it out.\n\n333\n00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.640\nThe escalation process\naccessing your information so\n\n334\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.900\nthat's also good to have too.\n\n335\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.380\nAll right, so Microsoft tries to\nmaintain a transparent operation.\n\n336\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:52.680\nThey share with you where the information\nis located, what data centers are,\n\n337\n00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.070\nwhat the data centers are,\nwhere the data centers are located.\n\n338\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:03.170\nThe other thing that they'll do is\nthey'll give you a one month notice.\n\n339\n00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.000\nIf they're doing some kind of, for\ninstance, some maintenance on one of their\n\n340\n00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.170\ndata centers, or for any reason they\nhave to move your data out of region.\n\n341\n00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.840\nThat's one of the other things they'll\ntell you as a customer when you set your\n\n342\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.420\ndomain location.\n\n343\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.720\nThat's contingent on where\nyour data is stored.\n\n344\n00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.100\nThey say we maintain in region data.\n\n345\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.380\nThey give you one month and\n\n346\n00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.390\nif they're going to move your\ndata out of a region, right?\n\n347\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:32.130\nSo we're going from North America,\nwe're going to Australia, Europe, for\n\n348\n00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.540\nany reason, we're gonna give you a one\nmonth notice before that happens, so\n\n349\n00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.990\nthat you can take any kind of\nproactive measures that you have to.\n\n350\n00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.110\nLike I said, might be something that\ngoes contrary to whatever your internal\n\n351\n00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.600\ncorporate security policy is, so\nat least you have one month notice.\n\n352\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:54.880\nSo again, data location, support, human\nface like they say, and they hold their\n\n353\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.754\naccountability and they also give you\na certain level of uptime and availability\n\n354\n00:18:58.754 --> 00:19:02.090\nto your information and if that doesn't\nhappen, they will compensate you for it.\n\n355\n00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.820\n>> Yeah.\nSounds like they try to do a very good job\n\n356\n00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:08.160\nof making sure that you always know or\nhave the ability to find out\n\n357\n00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.120\nexactly at any given point in time\nwhere your data is being located.\n\n358\n00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.710\nCuz you gotta remember, these are big\ndata warehouses that they build.\n\n359\n00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:19.410\nAnd they're full of servers, and\nair conditioners, and all sorts of things.\n\n360\n00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.100\nAnd every now and then, they need to\nmaintenance those things, so your data\n\n361\n00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.700\nmight move to a different location at\nthat point in time while they do that.\n\n362\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.190\nOr they might have a complete outage.\n\n363\n00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.090\nOr they're gonna upgrade.\n\n364\n00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.610\nOr they've upgraded, and made a better\nlocation to store your data and\n\n365\n00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.170\nthey're gonna move it.\n\n366\n00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.740\nSo there's many different reasons\nwhy your data might move,\n\n367\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.780\nand they want to make sure\nthat you're aware of that.\n\n368\n00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.570\nThey want to make sure that no matter\nwhen it's moving, what time that happens,\n\n369\n00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.680\nthat you're aware of it.\n\n370\n00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.925\nAnd you can prepare for it, and\nyou're okay with it as well.\n\n371\n00:19:45.925 --> 00:19:47.000\n>> Mm-hm, that's right.\n\n372\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.080\nSo one of the next things that we\nhave to talk about if we're gonna\n\n373\n00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.640\ntalk about security is well,\nthe actual security of your information.\n\n374\n00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.970\nWhen we talk about location and\ndata centers.\n\n375\n00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:01.870\nAnd they use an approach that,\nmaybe you've heard about before and\n\n376\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:06.450\nif you're studying for other, maybe\nother exams, maybe you're gonna get into\n\n377\n00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.910\nMicrosoft World, you're gonna go for\na client or server administration.\n\n378\n00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.670\nYou're going to hear this\nconcept with Microsoft,\n\n379\n00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.770\nMicrosoft adopted it,\ncalled Defense and Depth.\n\n380\n00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.980\nIf you're a part of the military, right,\nyou already are familiar with this,\n\n381\n00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.680\nin fact that's where Microsoft adopted\nit from, I believe as a DOD standard.\n\n382\n00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.100\nThey adopted it right from\nthe United States military.\n\n383\n00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.230\nAnd this is a layer defense system, right?\n\n384\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:33.178\nIf you, again if you have\na $100,000 security system,\n\n385\n00:20:33.178 --> 00:20:36.831\nit can be bypassed with just\nsomebody holding a door open for\n\n386\n00:20:36.831 --> 00:20:40.210\nsomebody that's doing social engineering,\nright?\n\n387\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:44.640\nSo that one system by itself,\nthat security system isn't gonna really\n\n388\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.970\nensure you as a customer that your data's\nsecure, you have to have other mechanisms\n\n389\n00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.700\nthat compliment that security system and\nthat's what they do here.\n\n390\n00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.370\nThey make sure that you have\na layered defense system.\n\n391\n00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:58.120\nNow if you are familiar with Defense\nIn Depth and maybe you have seen it,\n\n392\n00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.900\nyou're going to notice that here at the\nOffice 365 website or the Office website\n\n393\n00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.230\nthey don't use, I believe it's\nalmost a seven layered approach,\n\n394\n00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.620\nthey use a five layered approach here too.\n\n395\n00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.930\nAnd we can actually see that.\n\n396\n00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:14.265\nThey break it down to physical security,\nlogical security, data security,\n\n397\n00:21:14.265 --> 00:21:18.718\nuser controls, and admin controls,\nand this are the five.\n\n398\n00:21:18.718 --> 00:21:24.350\nAgain, it's still a, the Defence in Depth\nprocess but they pulled what they need\n\n399\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:28.900\nout of that process for maintaining your\ninformation while is sits in the Cloud.\n\n400\n00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.570\nNow, so what do we have inside\nof the physical security?\n\n401\n00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.270\nWell, 24 hour monitoring\nof the data centers, right?\n\n402\n00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.686\nThey have, obviously they're not\ngonna go home for the night and\n\n403\n00:21:38.686 --> 00:21:41.990\nthey're gonna leave your data worth,\nwhatever it's worth to your company and\n\n404\n00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.360\nall the other companies that they're\nmonitoring and then go home for\n\n405\n00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.920\nthe night and\nleave that information just sitting there.\n\n406\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.400\nInside of their data centers they also\nmake sure that they implement things like\n\n407\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.860\nmulti factor authentication\nincluding biometrics for\n\n408\n00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.930\njust basic access into the data center.\n\n409\n00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.890\nSo notice that it's starting physical,\nright?\n\n410\n00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.310\nWe talk about that security lock.\n\n411\n00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.100\nThey're not just putting\nin a security system.\n\n412\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.360\nThey're making sure that every\n\n413\n00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.940\none of the data centers\nare constantly being monitored.\n\n414\n00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.210\nThat if you are going to access the data\ncenter that you have to be an employee.\n\n415\n00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.560\nAnd they're going to use biometrics and\n\n416\n00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.540\nwhatever multi-factor authentication\nthey're gonna implement.\n\n417\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.720\nThey also use things\nlike network segregation.\n\n418\n00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.530\nRight?\n\n419\n00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.690\nAnd this is important.\n\n420\n00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:33.700\nIn fact, Dan, you had a good question\nin the first portion of this episode.\n\n421\n00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.340\nSaid, well I know how memory works right,\n\n422\n00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.042\nif I've got some data stored in the server\nand memory and I've got multiple companies\n\n423\n00:22:40.042 --> 00:22:44.310\nwell, they're storing that data inside\nof you know, unified memory there so.\n\n424\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.200\nHow did they block it off to where\nwe don't have to worry about that,\n\n425\n00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.000\nthe lack of security,\nlet's say, from one company,\n\n426\n00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.660\naffecting one that has it\nlocked down like Fort Knox?\n\n427\n00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.360\nWell that's where the network\nsegregation comes in.\n\n428\n00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.820\nIs that if you are a company,\ncuz infrastructure's a service,\n\n429\n00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.830\nyou add networking,\nyou add virtual servers,\n\n430\n00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:08.270\nwhere they do separate that information,\nor separate that communication so\n\n431\n00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.270\nthat you know your data's secure\nregardless of the lack of security maybe\n\n432\n00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:15.850\nfrom another company that might be\nholding their information in the Cloud.\n\n433\n00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.620\nThe other thing is role separation.\n\n434\n00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.510\nNow, role separation is important when\nit comes to physical security and\n\n435\n00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.950\nthis is just very simple.\n\n436\n00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.840\nI had a military veteran set two\nkeys on the launch pad right?\n\n437\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.850\n>> Yep.\n>> Why do they do that?\n\n438\n00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.270\nWell you don't have, you don't want that\none person being able to make a major\n\n439\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.590\ndecision without somebody else being there\nis ultimately what it boils down to.\n\n440\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.290\nSo they also implement role separation,\nright?\n\n441\n00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.850\nI don't want the person that backs my data\nup also to be the restoration operator.\n\n442\n00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.760\nThat's a common thing to separate\nthose roles within a company.\n\n443\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.090\nThat person that backs up the information,\n\n444\n00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.970\nif they also can restore that\ninformation with virtualization,\n\n445\n00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.532\nwhat means that they can't just take\nthat information off of the machine.\n\n446\n00:23:52.532 --> 00:23:55.794\nBuild a virtual machine and restore it,\nand now they have access to your data.\n\n447\n00:23:55.794 --> 00:23:59.069\nSo they do role separation, and\nthat makes sure that anybody that's\n\n448\n00:23:59.069 --> 00:24:01.787\nin a key position or\nkey role inside of their data center.\n\n449\n00:24:01.787 --> 00:24:05.575\nDoesn't have too much.\n\n450\n00:24:05.575 --> 00:24:06.298\n>> Access?\n\n451\n00:24:06.298 --> 00:24:09.740\n>> Access power, yeah,\nyeah, access exactly.\n\n452\n00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.670\nOne of the last things in physical\nsecurity that's very important too is\n\n453\n00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.230\nwell, what happens when hardware fails?\n\n454\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.350\nIt's not a matter of if hardware fails, we\nall know here, very well, and I'm sure you\n\n455\n00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.570\nguys do out there and if you don't\nyou're getting into IT, look out there,\n\n456\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:29.020\nit's not a matter of if hardware fails,\nit's just a matter of when it fails.\n\n457\n00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.970\nWell, those drives, right?\n\n458\n00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.440\nWe talked about those drives,\nthose drives have data on them, right?\n\n459\n00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.690\nWell, do they dispose of\nthe information that's\n\n460\n00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.710\non those drives when\nthey're replacing them?\n\n461\n00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.980\nAnd they do.\nThey implement things like data wiping and\n\n462\n00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.840\ncomplete hardware destruction.\n\n463\n00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.740\nSo we don't have, well, I should say,\nfind your data out there somewhere.\n\n464\n00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.730\nNot on Microsoft's hands\non some recycled drive, and\n\n465\n00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.830\nthey start rebuilding the information.\n\n466\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.410\nSo faulty hardware drives,\nthey do wiping and destruction.\n\n467\n00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:04.420\nWe know that in security, and if you\ndon't know this, when it comes to data\n\n468\n00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.600\neradication, the ultimate data eradication\nis destruction of the hardware.\n\n469\n00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.720\nIt's one of the easiest ways\nto make sure that it's secure.\n\n470\n00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.870\nSo Dan, physical security here,\nthey really do their job.\n\n471\n00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:20.300\nThey let you know, and they implement\njust at the physical security level.\n\n472\n00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.620\nMultiple techniques there.\n\n473\n00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.650\n>> Yeah, all the best practices,\nwe're talking about Microsoft here,\n\n474\n00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:28.650\nthey've got the wherewithal,\nthe affluence necessary\n\n475\n00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:33.830\nto ensure that all of those procedures and\nbest practices are being put into place.\n\n476\n00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.810\nI'm sure that they have got armed guards,\nall the way down to you name it.\n\n477\n00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.410\nEvery kind of physical security,\n\n478\n00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.620\ndown to a lock on a door,\nis going to be implemented.\n\n479\n00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.870\nEverything they can think of is\ngoing to keep your data safe and\n\n480\n00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.860\nthat's a good thing.\n\n481\n00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.600\nNow we talk about physical security Wes,\n\n482\n00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.280\nthat leads us into what\nabout logical security?\n\n483\n00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.290\n>> The logical security.\n\n484\n00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.880\n>> A hacker trying to get at my stuff.\n\n485\n00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.810\n>> That's right, yeah.\n\n486\n00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.710\nAnd so, now we're talking about we can\ngive you an instance, servers running.\n\n487\n00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:58.440\nAll right?\n\n488\n00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.790\nWell if the hacker, like Dan says,\ncan put malicious code on that server,\n\n489\n00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.660\nremember if I can get that malicious\ncode into unchecked memory I can run\n\n490\n00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.620\nanything I want, right.\n\n491\n00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.690\nI can execute that code.\n\n492\n00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.820\nWell they implement server white listing,\nall right.\n\n493\n00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.630\nServer white listing has\na couple of terms, you know,\n\n494\n00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.570\nwhen it comes to do you want something to\nrun or do you not want something to run.\n\n495\n00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.460\nOr do you want something to not run,\nall right.\n\n496\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.760\nWell, white listing is saying basically,\n\n497\n00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.690\nthese processes are the only\nthing that can run.\n\n498\n00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:27.660\nEverything else is blocked.\n\n499\n00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.890\nThat's white listing.\n\n500\n00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.410\nBlack listing is the opposite of that.\n\n501\n00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:34.010\nThat just says,\nnothing can run until I tell it.\n\n502\n00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.290\nAll right.\nSo, it really depends on your company,\n\n503\n00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.940\non premise,\nyou can implement whichever one you want.\n\n504\n00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.880\nWhat this is gonna do is it's gonna say\nonly the processes that are on this\n\n505\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.770\nlist can run.\n\n506\n00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.190\nNothing else can run outside of that.\n\n507\n00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:49.660\nSo they do white listing on their servers.\n\n508\n00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:55.641\nThe other thing that they have too is\na dedicated threat management team.\n\n509\n00:26:55.641 --> 00:26:57.290\nAnd the threat management team,\n\n510\n00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:02.190\nthey are doing some pretty massive\nstuff when it comes to making sure that\n\n511\n00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.260\nyour data is ongoingly or proactively,\n\n512\n00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:12.380\nI guess is a better way to put it,\nthere to protect you.\n\n513\n00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.840\nThey prevent,\nthey mitigate malicious attacks,\n\n514\n00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.240\nthey even have ongoing things\nlike port scanning and perimeter.\n\n515\n00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.310\nThey said perimeter or vulnerability\ntests, I always think of pen testing.\n\n516\n00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:27.760\nSo they're constantly checking themselves,\nputting themselves in check.\n\n517\n00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.950\nNot putting anybody else in check, but\nsaying, where do we stand right now,\n\n518\n00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:31.750\nwith our security.\n\n519\n00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:35.860\nSo let's find out if the perimeter\nnetworks that you're going through to\n\n520\n00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.590\nstore your data,\nwithin their internal data centers.\n\n521\n00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:42.430\nDMZs is another thing that Microsoft\ncalls them, perimeter networks lot, DMZ,\n\n522\n00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.549\nmaking sure that the DMZ is good.\n\n523\n00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.360\nIntrusion prevention and detection,\nthey also run as well on their server.\n\n524\n00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.790\nOr not just on their servers but\nthrough the entire data center.\n\n525\n00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.200\nSo they do a really good job.\n\n526\n00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.810\nThe other thing too is\nthe customer lock box.\n\n527\n00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:00.900\nAnd I've already kinda mentioned that so I\ndon't wanna go too much into in again but\n\n528\n00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.940\nremember lock box processes just mean\nthe customer's data is locked down, and\n\n529\n00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.370\nthe customer is essentially\nthe one that has the key.\n\n530\n00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:12.781\nAnd they can say If our engineers\nhave to access your information,\n\n531\n00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:18.217\nthen you're gonna have to go to a process\ndirectly interacting with the company,\n\n532\n00:28:18.217 --> 00:28:22.388\nor the customer, I should say,\nto be able to access that data,\n\n533\n00:28:22.388 --> 00:28:25.260\nor proverbially unlocking the box there.\n\n534\n00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.447\nSo logical security, Dan, and\nthey also have a layered system, so\n\n535\n00:28:29.447 --> 00:28:31.890\nyou could see layers upon layers here.\n\n536\n00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.510\nAnd logical security,\nthey don't slack on that one either.\n\n537\n00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:35.110\n>> Awesome.\n\n538\n00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.130\nNow another thing we gotta think about is,\n\n539\n00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.900\none of the ways that companies tend\nto secure data is through encryption.\n\n540\n00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.530\nBasically taking the message,\ngarbling it up with a key that only\n\n541\n00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.190\nthe person with the key can\nread the message, right?\n\n542\n00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.475\nIt's something we did as kids.\n\n543\n00:28:50.475 --> 00:28:53.200\nI'm sure, you've done it as well so\nyou could pass notes in class.\n\n544\n00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.250\nIt's a lot of fun.\n\n545\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.990\nAnd we've just basically\ntaken our love for\n\n546\n00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:00.550\nthat kinda thing, put it into IT,\nand used that to secure data.\n\n547\n00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.250\nWe wanna be able to pass messages.\n\n548\n00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.340\nWanna be able to have\nthings that are secure so\n\n549\n00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.430\nthat only people with some sort\nof key is able to look at that.\n\n550\n00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:12.840\nAre we able to see that as well,\nwith Microsoft's cloud services?\n\n551\n00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.140\n>> Yes, you can absolutely.\n\n552\n00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.720\nI mean, it's important, right.\n\n553\n00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.190\nThink about going to a website,\nyour bank, right.\n\n554\n00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:23.500\nWe were talking about some banking\nterminology before we started this and\n\n555\n00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.190\nwent live here.\n\n556\n00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.760\nYou go to a banking website, you want\nto make sure that that server,first\n\n557\n00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.410\nof all the server that you're going\nto is the server it says it is.\n\n558\n00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:38.330\nAs well as making sure that the\ncommunications between your web browser,\n\n559\n00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.560\nwe'll make our own contributions\nto the English language, is safe.\n\n560\n00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.100\nI don't want to open a web browser,\nconnect to their server, and\n\n561\n00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.560\nthen everybody can eavesdrop\non my information.\n\n562\n00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:53.180\nSo they also go into protections making\nsure that that communication is secure.\n\n563\n00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.910\nAnd there's a couple different ways,\nright?\n\n564\n00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.840\nYou have to know for\nthe MTA cloud fundamentals is what\n\n565\n00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.760\nthe difference between the concept\nof at rest and over the wire.\n\n566\n00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.680\nNow, when we say over the wire, you might\nsay, well I got a wireless network.\n\n567\n00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.390\nWhat do you mean?\n\n568\n00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.680\nWell that's just figurative for\ncommunication that is traveling over or\n\n569\n00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.580\ntraversing the network.\n\n570\n00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.370\nRight?\n>> A virtual wire.\n\n571\n00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.130\n>> That's right, it's a virtual wire.\n\n572\n00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.280\nThat's exactly what it is.\n\n573\n00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.930\nSo the other one is at rest and\nat rest is what it sounds like.\n\n574\n00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.640\nYour data is not sleeping but\nit's being stored on a hard drive and\n\n575\n00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.920\nit's not moving, right?\n\n576\n00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.780\nIt's not being actively processed in\nmemory on one of their servers, or\n\n577\n00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.500\nit's not being delivered.\n\n578\n00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.140\nIt's sitting on a hard drive\nsomewhere in their data center.\n\n579\n00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.510\nAnd so there's a couple of things that you\nhave to worry about when it comes to your\n\n580\n00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.430\nsecurity.\n\n581\n00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.730\nNow what Dan mentioned, is how about\nconnecting to the web browser?\n\n582\n00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.200\nAnd they do that through SSL and TLS.\n\n583\n00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.420\nNow whichever one you use is really\ncontingent on the web browser that you're\n\n584\n00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.170\nusing to support.\n\n585\n00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.670\nSome web browsers will use SSL\nbecause maybe they don't support.\n\n586\n00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:58.030\nMost of the modern web\nbrowsers support TLS and\n\n587\n00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.850\nit's going to give you the best security.\n\n588\n00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.000\nAnd we can actually see that here too.\n\n589\n00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.890\nSo if I go in, for instance, and I go in\nto sign into the Office 365 portal, and\n\n590\n00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.810\nI'm not going to show you guys my dot,\ndot, dot password here.\n\n591\n00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:15.880\nBut this is for IT ProTV,\nwe use Office 365 as well.\n\n592\n00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.870\nAnd you might see that, well look right\nthere, we got that big green bar, and\n\n593\n00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.330\nit says HTTPS.\n\n594\n00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.250\nSo the answer is yes, Dan.\n\n595\n00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:29.220\nWhen you connect to the web page,\nyour web browser and the communication to\n\n596\n00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.690\nthe server is encrypted using secure\nsocket layer, or transport layer security.\n\n597\n00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.890\nAnd if you think that's in question,\n\n598\n00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.680\nyou can always come up here,\nclick on the little green bar here.\n\n599\n00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.450\nIt's gonna be different regardless\nof the web browser you're in.\n\n600\n00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.000\nIf you're in Internet Explorer,\n\n601\n00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.570\nthe whole entire address bar glows green,\nbut it still has that little lock there.\n\n602\n00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.037\nAnd, I can go to the connection and\nI can find out, is this information?\n\n603\n00:31:53.037 --> 00:31:54.178\nHas it been verified?\n\n604\n00:31:54.178 --> 00:31:57.850\nAnd, I can go as far, they use industry\nwide standards, and if I want to check out\n\n605\n00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:01.090\nthe certificate, All I gotta do is\nlook at certificate information and\n\n606\n00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.600\nI can see that this is a Semantic Class\nThree EV SLA Certificate Authority that\n\n607\n00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.020\nhas issued this certificate.\n\n608\n00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.530\nNow juggling inside, what does that mean,\nit means a company that backs their\n\n609\n00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:14.510\ncertificate, their encryption,\nat a high financial level is saying,\n\n610\n00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.730\nwe put the seal on approval that when you\nconnect to this website it's Office 365.\n\n611\n00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.640\nAnd that's definitely something\nthat we need to worry about.\n\n612\n00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.420\nNow, there are other things, too.\n\n613\n00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.020\nIt goes a little bit farther,\nwe need to talk about in transit, right?\n\n614\n00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:32.290\nThe in transit part is that encryption\nwith SSL and TLS, but also at rest means\n\n615\n00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:35.790\nthat they're gonna encrypt the information\nwhen it's on their server, so you have\n\n616\n00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.940\nthe benefit, if you start the first\ncommunication, even logging in, right?\n\n617\n00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:44.460\nThat very first point when you log in,\nthat login information's encrypted.\n\n618\n00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:48.380\nAnd then when the webpage renders its\nwebsites and you start interacting with\n\n619\n00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.160\nmaybe with let's say Word online and\nyou're sending information over\n\n620\n00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:56.220\nthe wire there it's going to be encrypted,\nso that's a good thing to have as well.\n\n621\n00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.680\nThey also reiterate the threat\nmanagement process that they have.\n\n622\n00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.030\nThey have implemented a constant security\nmonitoring and this is really cool too.\n\n623\n00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.590\nFile and data monitoring,\nconstant file and\n\n624\n00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.730\ndata monitoring for\nan integrity and prevention and\n\n625\n00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:14.010\ntampering with the information, and that's\nwhere that I in the CIA triad comes back.\n\n626\n00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.180\nSo you can kind of see\nthis all coming together.\n\n627\n00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.760\nWe've talked about the availability,\nright?\n\n628\n00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.801\nFor the data centers themselves,\nmaintaining a fault tolerance\n\n629\n00:33:20.801 --> 00:33:23.940\ncopy of information across\nthe data centers if they need to.\n\n630\n00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.990\nIntegrity, meaning we're constantly\nmonitoring your information,\n\n631\n00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.650\nmaking sure that it hasn't\nbeen tampered with and\n\n632\n00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:34.225\nthen finally we're using TLF so\nI kinda did that backwards.\n\n633\n00:33:34.225 --> 00:33:37.900\n[LAUGH] AIC but that's the CIA,\nConfidentiality, Integrity,\n\n634\n00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:38.490\nand Availability.\n\n635\n00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.490\nAnd then they also have things, like for\n\n636\n00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.646\ninstance, the exchange\nonline threat protection.\n\n637\n00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:47.357\nWe think about emails,\nwe think about spam protection,\n\n638\n00:33:47.357 --> 00:33:52.540\nwe think about malicious attachments,\nyou know it's just things like this.\n\n639\n00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.230\nThe Exchange Online threat management or\nthreat protection\n\n640\n00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:02.360\ndoes help protect things like your email\nfrom spam and just all types of malware.\n\n641\n00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.160\nI was gonna say adware, but\nthat falls under the umbrella of malware.\n\n642\n00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.650\nSo we can see a layered\ndefense system as well.\n\n643\n00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:12.578\nYou can go as far as user controls.\n\n644\n00:34:12.578 --> 00:34:17.470\nThey implement S/MIME as your rights\nmanagement, so if you're doing DRM,\n\n645\n00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:19.950\nDigital Rights Management,\nyou can implement that as well, and\n\n646\n00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:23.720\nyou can maintain what happens to your\ninformation once it leaves their networks.\n\n647\n00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.830\nIn fact, we had a great\ndiscussion off camera about that.\n\n648\n00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:30.700\nIs that you know okay, now the encryption\nhas happened between myself,\n\n649\n00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.700\nthe web browser, and Microsoft,\n\n650\n00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:36.450\nwhat happens when it leaves Microsoft's\nnetworks and goes to somebody else?\n\n651\n00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:39.350\nDo you lose your ability to maintain\nsecurity on your information\n\n652\n00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.450\nafter the fact?\n\n653\n00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:41.570\nAnd the answer is no.\n\n654\n00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:46.410\nThey do implement the secure\nmultimedia Internet mail extensions\n\n655\n00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:50.510\nas well as some additional technology so\nthat you can make sure the information is\n\n656\n00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.770\nstill secure and\nmaintained after it leaves their networks.\n\n657\n00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.980\nAnd then they also have admin controls,\nand we've already really covered that, so\n\n658\n00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.840\nI'm not gonna to go too much over that,\n\n659\n00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.930\nthat's back to that\nphysical security as well.\n\n660\n00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.590\nYou know, making sure those strict\nauditing processes, strong passwords,\n\n661\n00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:08.000\nbiometrics and\neven mobile management capabilities too.\n\n662\n00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.560\nSo they do, I think,\na really good job in this.\n\n663\n00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:16.170\nRemember it's a five layer approach and\n\n664\n00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:21.080\nif you want more information on that five\nlayered approach, not as it relates maybe\n\n665\n00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.120\nspecifically to this example, but for\nyour own benefit cuz it's good to know,\n\n666\n00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.710\nyou can always go to Microsoft's tech net\nand just type into the tech net search\n\n667\n00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:31.130\nengine, defense in depth and\nyou'll get a whole entire,\n\n668\n00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.400\nprobably more information than you really\nwant but you can really check it out.\n\n669\n00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.050\n>> Awesome.\nWell it sounds like Microsoft\n\n670\n00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:40.090\nis giving us a reasonable assurance of\nsecurity for the data that we are storing\n\n671\n00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:45.030\nwith them as we enter into a contract\nwith them really, to store our data.\n\n672\n00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.690\nThat's a good thing,\nthat's what we want and that allows us\n\n673\n00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:53.900\nto be a little more inclined maybe to\nmove to some sort of cloud services.\n\n674\n00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:57.070\nI know that I actually really like\ncloud services, it's awesome stuff.\n\n675\n00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:58.980\n>> You know, and Dan,\nI'm glad you mentioned that.\n\n676\n00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:03.630\nOn that note, just one more thing\nis that you know there is a big\n\n677\n00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.460\nscare in corporate environments as,\nhey, is the cloud safe?\n\n678\n00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:11.850\nDo we have these safety mechanisms and\nmeasures in place?\n\n679\n00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:15.730\nCan I trust the provider that I'm using?\n\n680\n00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:18.430\nWell, I can't speak for\nthe other providers, I'm not sure, but\n\n681\n00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:21.640\nI can tell you what,\nMicrosoft has done a really good job and\n\n682\n00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:26.000\nthey've got thorough documentation that\nif you do have, you know maybe you're\n\n683\n00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.220\nusing the MTA cloud fundamentals to\nmaybe get a foothold into the team.\n\n684\n00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.070\nMaybe you already have IT experience,\nright?\n\n685\n00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.450\nAnd you want to get a foothold\ninto the cloud team.\n\n686\n00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.830\nWell, you've got enough documentation\nright here that you can present it to\n\n687\n00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:39.900\nsomebody that maybe does\nmake those decisions, and\n\n688\n00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.350\nsay look, here's the documentation,\nand yes, you can trust it.\n\n689\n00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:43.870\n>> Awesome.\n\n690\n00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:47.765\nWell, Wes, thank you so much for\nfor joining us today and showing us\n\n691\n00:36:47.765 --> 00:36:51.735\nwhat we can do as far as security wise\nwhen it comes to Microsoft Cloud services.\n\n692\n00:36:51.735 --> 00:36:54.425\nThat being said it looks like we've\nwrapped up yet another episode.\n\n693\n00:36:54.425 --> 00:36:56.725\nThank you again and\nthank you for watching.\n\n694\n00:36:56.725 --> 00:36:57.915\nWe always enjoy our viewers.\n\n695\n00:36:57.915 --> 00:36:59.865\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n696\n00:36:59.865 --> 00:37:01.735\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n697\n00:37:01.735 --> 00:37:02.435\n>> And I'm Wes Ryan.\n\n698\n00:37:02.435 --> 00:37:03.777\n>> We'll see

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:18.140\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.280\nAnd in today's episode, well,\n\n5\n00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.420\nwe're continuing on with our\nMTA Cloud Fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.950\nJoining me in the studio today,\nwell, it's my good friend and\n\n7\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.810\nmaster of all that is cloud,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.030\nWelcome to the show, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.700\n>> Hey, how you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.670\nIt's great to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.330\nAnd that's right, today we're gonna be\ntalking about using cloud services.\n\n12\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.460\nWe've got a little bit more\ntheory to throw at you guys here,\n\n13\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.350\nbecause you do have to understand\nsome of the basic principles and\n\n14\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.930\nconcepts when you are going to make\na choice of using certain cloud services.\n\n15\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.320\nOne of the first things we are going\nto talk about is capacity.\n\n16\n00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.306\nThat's one of the thing on the exam\nyou're gonna have to be aware of,\n\n17\n00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:55.284\nis what does compassablity,\ner compassability.\n\n18\n00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:56.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's two words there.\n\n19\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.130\nThat's the combination of capacity and\nelasticity, capacity.\n\n20\n00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.908\n>> I like that.\n\n21\n00:01:01.908 --> 00:01:02.557\n>> We'll get it right, yeah?\n\n22\n00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:03.374\n[LAUGH]\n>> Good save there, Wes.\n\n23\n00:01:03.374 --> 00:01:03.954\nGood save.\n\n24\n00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:04.907\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, thank you.\n\n25\n00:01:04.907 --> 00:01:07.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So capacity is about storage, right?\n\n26\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.430\nWhen we talk about elasticity of\nthe cloud, what are we talking about?\n\n27\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.870\nWell, we're talking about the ability\nto add more storage as you need it.\n\n28\n00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.940\nNow, remember in some of the previous\nepisodes we set the stage for\n\n29\n00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.950\non premise, right?\n\n30\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.050\nWhen we talk about capacity on premise, we\nhave to add additional hard drives every\n\n31\n00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.470\ntime we accrue too much storage space or\nwe don't have enough storage space.\n\n32\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.410\nAnd that's going to be\na sizable investment.\n\n33\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.560\nAnd it's not only just a sizable\ninvestment, it takes time, right?\n\n34\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160\nIt's not going be something\nthat's gonna happen immediately.\n\n35\n00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.410\nAnd that is one of the benefits when it\ncomes to using the Cloud, is the ability,\n\n36\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.830\nfor instance, inside of OneDrive.\n\n37\n00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.890\nIf I add additional users to my\ninfrastructure inside of the Cloud,\n\n38\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.510\nthen OneDrive automatically scales up\nto ensure that I have plenty of access.\n\n39\n00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.150\nAnd let me go ahead and\nshow you that here.\n\n40\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.910\nI'm actually logged into the Office\n365 Administration Center.\n\n41\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.880\nIf I was to add additional users here,\nand I've got, let's see.\n\n42\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.360\nI think I've got just\nmyself in here right now.\n\n43\n00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.390\nAnd we'll add some users\ncoming up as well.\n\n44\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.050\nIf I needed to add, to scale out, right?\n\n45\n00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.150\nMaybe I've got 500 users that\nare coming in across my entire company.\n\n46\n00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.100\nWell, I'm gonna have to\nmake sure that beforehand\n\n47\n00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.100\nI made the plans to make sure that\nI have enough hard drive space,\n\n48\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.180\nwe have enough computers, we have\nto expand and be prepared for that.\n\n49\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.090\nHere in the cloud, capacity is just\nas easy as adding an end user.\n\n50\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.360\nAnd as you add the end user, it provisions\n\n51\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.370\ntheir location in OneDrive to ensure\nthat they can store their data as well.\n\n52\n00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.550\nSo when it comes to capacity,\nDan, I tell you,\n\n53\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.590\nit's a really good thing\ninside of the cloud.\n\n54\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.940\nBecause you can scale out,\nright, you can increase\n\n55\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.850\nthe storage capacity that you need just\nby simply adding an additional user.\n\n56\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.657\n>> Yeah, it's awesome.\n\n57\n00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:00.800\nWhen you're thinking of capacity,\nyou've gotta think of it as a container.\n\n58\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.970\nWhat does this container hold?\n\n59\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.240\nAnd Wes is making that\npoint very succinctly.\n\n60\n00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.160\nThat okay, I've got 500 users, right.\n\n61\n00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.827\nThat's my capacity right now.\n\n62\n00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:13.080\nAnd then he started talking\nabout that old scalability.\n\n63\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.690\nWhat happens when I go beyond 500 users?\n\n64\n00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.690\nWhat happens when I need more than that\ntwo terabyte drive that I've got in there?\n\n65\n00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.990\nHow do I scale it up?\n\n66\n00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.370\nAnd that really begs a good question, Wes.\n\n67\n00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.270\nHow does,\n\n68\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.010\ninside of the cloud, what are we talking\nabout when it comes to scalability?\n\n69\n00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.090\nHow well does this scale, what can I\nthink of when it comes to scalability?\n\n70\n00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.880\n>> Well, one of the big things that\nthat's really contingent on is\n\n71\n00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.280\nwhat size company do you have,\nversus what subscription plan do you have.\n\n72\n00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.390\nNow we're going to look really in depth\nat the subscription plans, coming up.\n\n73\n00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.584\nBut you have to know that\nwhen it comes to scalability,\n\n74\n00:03:43.584 --> 00:03:44.710\nthat's really what it's based on.\n\n75\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.690\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n76\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.650\nNow, when you need to consider,\nhow many users do I need?\n\n77\n00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.600\nHow big is my company gonna be?\n\n78\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.950\nWell, that's really gonna be based\non whatever plan you choose here.\n\n79\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.690\nSo for instance,\n\n80\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.579\nlet me show you just small business,\nthe small business plan options.\n\n81\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.110\nAnd like I said, we'll be taking\na look at this a little bit more.\n\n82\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.260\nIf I scroll all the way\ndown here to the bottom,\n\n83\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.400\nI can see that if I have this service,\nif I'm using it,\n\n84\n00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.700\nsubscribed to this service and paying that\nmonthly fee, then I only have 300 users.\n\n85\n00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.810\nSo now, in the scenario that I set and\nthrew at you, I said well,\n\n86\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.150\nwe've got 500 new users.\n\n87\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.080\nMaybe we got 50 users across 10 different\nlocations that are now starting,\n\n88\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.270\ncuz we're expanding our business.\n\n89\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.790\nWell, the problem is this plan\nisn't gonna be good for you, right.\n\n90\n00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.890\nIt's gonna scale up to around 300 users.\n\n91\n00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.920\nAnd then anything after that,\nwell, it's just not gonna work.\n\n92\n00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.580\nSo the good thing is,\nif that's not what you need, well,\n\n93\n00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.170\nthey've got other options here for you.\n\n94\n00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.990\nAnd on one of the main pages here,\nthey talk about the Enterprise level.\n\n95\n00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.707\nAnd if we scroll all the way down to the\nbottom, one of the things that I should\n\n96\n00:04:48.707 --> 00:04:53.277\nsee somewhere in here is the fact that\nthe users are, I'll tell you what,\n\n97\n00:04:53.277 --> 00:04:55.732\nlet me go ahead and select the E1 here.\n\n98\n00:04:55.732 --> 00:04:58.798\nAnd at the bottom of the E1 plan,\nI believe,\n\n99\n00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:02.930\nis where you'll see that there\nis unlimited users, right.\n\n100\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.580\nYou don't have a limit.\n\n101\n00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.020\nAnd I'm lying to you there, it doesn't\nseem to show it right there at the top.\n\n102\n00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.167\nSo, let me go ahead and\njust back up here just a second.\n\n103\n00:05:15.167 --> 00:05:16.620\nAnd it's probably right at the top.\n\n104\n00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.870\nYep, it is, so they switched it around.\n\n105\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.900\nIt's on the bottom of the first page,\nit's on the top of the second page here.\n\n106\n00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.010\nAnd notice, users maximum.\n\n107\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.000\nUnlimited, right?\n\n108\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.640\nSo when you get into things\nlike Enterprise level plans,\n\n109\n00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.710\nyou don't have a limit on how many users.\n\n110\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.660\nSo by association too, you don't really\nhave a limit on storage capacity.\n\n111\n00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.060\nNow pay attention to the plan\nthat you're gonna use,\n\n112\n00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.430\nbecause that will dictate exactly\nhow much storage you can use.\n\n113\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.720\nBut the good thing here is\nwhen it comes to scalability,\n\n114\n00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.200\nif I need to add those 500 users,\nI need to add 1000 users,\n\n115\n00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.810\nI need to add beyond 3000 users,\nI can do that very easy.\n\n116\n00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.830\nAnd it's just that simple as making sure\nthat you purchase the plan that you need.\n\n117\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.120\n>> Now, Wes, if I find out, let's say\nthat for whatever reasons my comany has\n\n118\n00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.390\nhit hard times and\nI've had to lay off half of my staff.\n\n119\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.670\nAnd hopefully that never happens, but\nsometimes that kind of thing does.\n\n120\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.250\nAm I able to scale the other way as well?\n\n121\n00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.290\nCan I change my plan to go to\nsomething smaller, reduce my costs?\n\n122\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.130\n>> Unfortunately, you can't do that.\n\n123\n00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.140\nOne of the things, and that's why\nthey say when you purchase a plan,\n\n124\n00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.120\nknow exactly what plan you're gonna\nbe purchasing based on your needs.\n\n125\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.950\nBecause once you set your tenant,\nyou can't change it, right.\n\n126\n00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.420\nYou're gonna turn around, and\n\n127\n00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.755\nwhat's gonna happen here is you're\ngonna have to start all over again.\n\n128\n00:06:36.755 --> 00:06:38.615\nYou're gonna have to rename a new tenant.\n\n129\n00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:42.915\nSo that's why it's very important that you\nneed to still do some planning, right.\n\n130\n00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:45.577\nI say scalability, we're not moving\nto the Cloud and all of the sudden,\n\n131\n00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:47.815\nwe moved to the Cloud here and\nwe don't have to plan anymore.\n\n132\n00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:51.395\nIt is not that way, you still have\nto plan just like on premise.\n\n133\n00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:54.825\nAnd you have to plan to what you\nthink you're company is gonna do.\n\n134\n00:06:54.825 --> 00:06:56.315\nMaybe you are gonna be a small business,\n\n135\n00:06:56.315 --> 00:07:00.360\nmaybe you don't think you're\ngonna ever grow passed 300 users.\n\n136\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.500\nWell, then you're okay.\n\n137\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.150\nBut if you know, and you have planned and\n\n138\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.250\nyou've the foresight that you're\ngonna go beyond 300 users,\n\n139\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.980\nthen what's gonna happen here is you're\ngonna have to rename that tenant.\n\n140\n00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.280\nNow the other thing to keep mind is\nthat if you do delete those users,\n\n141\n00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.220\none of the things you'll\nhave to just understand is,\n\n142\n00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.120\nyou just don't get charged anymore for\nthem.\n\n143\n00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.312\nAll right?\nSo even if you do scale down like that,\n\n144\n00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:24.776\nyou can scale down like that.\n\n145\n00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:28.115\nIf you do have to, and\nhopefully it doesn't happen that way, but\n\n146\n00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:30.110\nyou do have to lay off some people.\n\n147\n00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.140\nWell, you just don't get charged anymore,\nright.\n\n148\n00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.980\nYou can do things like soft deletes too,\nwhere they're still in your database, but\n\n149\n00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.440\nthey're inactive users.\n\n150\n00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.450\nSo, you do have some options like that.\n\n151\n00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.260\nSo make sure beforehand you do\nthe plan for the scalability.\n\n152\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.990\n>> So on each one of these plans I'm\ngetting charged by the user, and\n\n153\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.080\nnot by necessarily the plan, per se.\n\n154\n00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.901\n>> That's right.\n\n155\n00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:54.490\nNow I will say that one of the things,\ndepending on how much functionality\n\n156\n00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.731\nyou need, the per use or per user\namount does kind of increase there.\n\n157\n00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:01.171\nSo you have to watch that.\n\n158\n00:08:01.171 --> 00:08:04.811\nWhich, again, when we get into selecting\nthe right plan when we setup our tenant,\n\n159\n00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:08.310\nwe'll show you a little more about the\noptions that you have available for you.\n\n160\n00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.672\nBut as it relates to scalability,\ndefinitely plan ahead so you know that for\n\n161\n00:08:12.672 --> 00:08:15.533\none, that you're not wasting money,\nfor sure,\n\n162\n00:08:15.533 --> 00:08:19.280\nyou're getting all of the functionality,\nbut at the same time,\n\n163\n00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.170\nyou're also planning for\na potential increase.\n\n164\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.650\nBecause thats, what it's about, right?\n\n165\n00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.100\nI'm going to the cloud cuz\nwe want to be successful.\n\n166\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.780\nSo, plan for your success ahead of time,\nand you should be okay on that one.\n\n167\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.382\n>> Yeah, and that's just for\nOneDrive, right?\n\n168\n00:08:32.382 --> 00:08:35.870\nThis is just for one cloud service\nprovided by Microsoft, OneDrive.\n\n169\n00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.037\nIf you go to Office 365, they'll\nhave their own plans and pricing and\n\n170\n00:08:40.037 --> 00:08:41.380\nability to scale.\n\n171\n00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.310\nSo what we really want to get across to\nyou as the viewer, as someone who is new,\n\n172\n00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.610\nI need to know about cloud, I want to\ntake this MTA cloud fundamentals exam,\n\n173\n00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.650\nwhat do I need to know when\nit comes to scalability?\n\n174\n00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.170\nIt's gonna change per the service,\nwhatever cloud service you might be using.\n\n175\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.060\nYou just have to be aware\nwhat scalability is.\n\n176\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.920\nRight?\nI have the ability to go up or down,\n\n177\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.490\nleft or right, and change and conform\nto what my business is actually doing.\n\n178\n00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.830\nSo if that's users,\nif that's what it is, or\n\n179\n00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:13.600\nif it's drive space,\nif it's capacity for RAM or throughput,\n\n180\n00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.240\nwhatever the case may be, that's what\nwe mean when we say scalability.\n\n181\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.420\nAnd you gotta remember the good old terms,\ndo I scale up or do I scale out?\n\n182\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.850\nWhich means if I scale up, I'm gonna add\nresources to the resource I already have.\n\n183\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:28.100\nSo I'm using a service that\nprovides me hard drive space,\n\n184\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.510\nstorage space, right, something\nlike OneNote, something like that.\n\n185\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.240\nIf I need more, again, I say,\nokay, it's a one terabyte drive or\n\n186\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.040\nmake it a two terabyte drive.\n\n187\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.242\nThat's scaling up.\n\n188\n00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:40.200\nScaling out's gonna be,\ngive me another OneNote subscription\n\n189\n00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.610\nthat has another one terabyte\nthat's scaling out, and\n\n190\n00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.520\nnow I have two subscriptions\nto OneNote that's scaling out.\n\n191\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.780\n>> And, it allows you to do both too.\n\n192\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.040\nSo, I'm glad you mentioned that.\n\n193\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.177\nYou can do that, right?\n\n194\n00:09:49.177 --> 00:09:52.374\nIf I've got one user that's\naccruing a lot of space,\n\n195\n00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:57.360\nthey can keep accruing that space, again,\njust adding space to a single account.\n\n196\n00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.140\nAnd if you do need multiple accounts,\nyou can do that as well.\n\n197\n00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.680\nAnd now we've got multiple, separated\nlocations where each individual user can\n\n198\n00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.950\nstore their data as your business grows.\n\n199\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.700\nAnd that's a very good thing to have.\n\n200\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.980\nSo when it comes down to it, make sure\nthat you do get the plan that you need for\n\n201\n00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.730\nwhatever the functionality is that you\nexpect to have inside of the cloud.\n\n202\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.130\n>> That's awesome.\n\n203\n00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.400\nNow, another thing we need to\nhit upon is an idea that we've\n\n204\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.000\nactually already talked about\na little bit in previous episodes.\n\n205\n00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.532\nSo if this word I'm about to throw out\nhere sounds a little unfamiliar to you,\n\n206\n00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:36.870\ngo back and check those episodes out,\ncuz we do speak upon this just a bit.\n\n207\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.386\nEnough to where you would know what\nthe heck we're talking about right now.\n\n208\n00:10:39.386 --> 00:10:41.210\n[LAUGH] And\nthen it's the idea of redundancy, right?\n\n209\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:46.010\nSo, when I give Microsoft my data,\n\n210\n00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.520\nthey're going to ensure that it's there,\nright, Wes?\n\n211\n00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.350\n>> Yep, definitely, and that-\n>> And they do that through redundance.\n\n212\n00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.350\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n213\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.340\nKeep in mind that when we\ntalk about redundancy,\n\n214\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.420\nwe need to make sure that we\nhave availability for our data.\n\n215\n00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.600\nThat is important, right.\n\n216\n00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.630\nSo to make sure that that happens,\nthey do distribute multiple copies of your\n\n217\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:11.400\ninformation across different regional or\ngeographical locations within your region.\n\n218\n00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.710\nAnd again, go back and check out those\nepisodes that we've talked about it,\n\n219\n00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.040\nbecause they've got a pretty\nstrict policy about what they do,\n\n220\n00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.544\nas far as letting you know\nwhere your data is located.\n\n221\n00:11:20.544 --> 00:11:22.050\nAnd I can actually show you that here,\ntoo.\n\n222\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.510\nNow we've already touched\nbase on this before.\n\n223\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.850\nBut remember it is regional and\n\n224\n00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.160\nyou've got the different regions\nacross the entire world here.\n\n225\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.230\nWe're here in the states.\n\n226\n00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:36.010\nIf you're in one of these other locations,\ntoo, this could be foreign to you as well.\n\n227\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.170\nThe North America could be foreign to you,\nso pay attention to what your region is.\n\n228\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.900\nAnd you can actually see if\nI select the region here,\n\n229\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.460\nI can see the multiple centers\nacross the United States here.\n\n230\n00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.800\nSo we have multiple copies of your data,\nmaking sure that when it comes to hardware\n\n231\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.110\ndata, we were talking about this, it's\nnot a matter of if hardware's gonna fail,\n\n232\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.260\nit's just a matter of\nwhen it's gonna fail.\n\n233\n00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.030\nIt happens, right?\n\n234\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.760\nSo one of the things that Microsoft does\nreally good at, in all of the money that\n\n235\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.980\nthey've invested in their cloud-based\nservices, is to have these different\n\n236\n00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.552\ngeographical locations, which maybe\nyou've been familiar with this before.\n\n237\n00:12:14.552 --> 00:12:18.550\nIf there happens to be\na disaster in this one area,\n\n238\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.980\nyou still have access to your data and\nit still remains available to you.\n\n239\n00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.220\n>> Yeah, you actually bring up a really\ngood point, availability, right?\n\n240\n00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.430\nThat's something that's very\nimportant to us as consumers or\n\n241\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.660\ncustomers to a cloud service.\n\n242\n00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.480\nIs, okay, you're keeping my data, and\nyou're making sure that it is safe, and\n\n243\n00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.260\nthrough that redundancy, you're making\nsure that it's always available, or\n\n244\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.330\nat least as available as possible.\n\n245\n00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.660\nAnd that brings up another\nreally good question, Wes, is,\n\n246\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.550\nwhat kind of availability can I\nexpect when using a cloud service?\n\n247\n00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.574\n>> Yes.\n\n248\n00:12:51.574 --> 00:12:55.495\nWhen we talk about availability, I want\nyou to think about 100% available, right?\n\n249\n00:12:55.495 --> 00:13:00.640\n100% availability means every\nsingle second, every single minute,\n\n250\n00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.551\nhour, day, month throughout the year,\nyou have access to your data.\n\n251\n00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:08.051\nNow, 100% availability is\njust not even feasible,\n\n252\n00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:10.510\nno company is going to give\nyou 100% availability.\n\n253\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.770\nNow, moving down that list,\n\n254\n00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.810\nyou can see that there are some\nother availability scales.\n\n255\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:23.070\nThe one that Microsoft specifically calls\nout as this 99.9% availability there, Dan.\n\n256\n00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.867\n>> Now that sounds pretty good.\n\n257\n00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:27.890\n99.9, that's almost 100.\n\n258\n00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.674\n>> Almost 100.\n\n259\n00:13:28.674 --> 00:13:29.670\nNot quite 100.\n\n260\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.314\nThat is, what?\n\n261\n00:13:30.314 --> 00:13:33.239\n86.4 seconds per day,\n\n262\n00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:38.850\n43 minutes per month and\n8.77 hours per year.\n\n263\n00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.390\n>> Nice math you got going on there,\nMr. John Nash.\n\n264\n00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:41.940\n>> Oh yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n265\n00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.895\n>> Cuz that's a pretty impressive.\n\n266\n00:13:42.895 --> 00:13:44.660\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, well, I wish I could say that but\n\n267\n00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.570\nyou guys have,\nif you've watched some of my episodes,\n\n268\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.950\nyou know that the English language and\nmath are my two worst skills.\n\n269\n00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I've actually got a list, and\n\n270\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.275\nyou can go-\n>> You cheater!\n\n271\n00:13:54.275 --> 00:13:56.030\n[LAUGHS]\n>> I cheated, that's right.\n\n272\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.270\nI know the cheat codes on this one,\nso I got the unlimited lives on it.\n\n273\n00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.590\nIf you don't know that information,\n\n274\n00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:08.150\nI certainly don't either,\nMicrosoft has their TechNet website.\n\n275\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.600\nNow if you're not familiar with what\nthe TechNet website is, it has exhaustive\n\n276\n00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.500\npapers on just about every technology\nthat Microsoft puts on the block.\n\n277\n00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.190\nAnd they also have some\nconceptual information too.\n\n278\n00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:22.080\nLike, we were mentioning the ten immutable\nlaws of security in a previous episode.\n\n279\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.100\nThey're the ones that set the stage,\ndefense in-depth.\n\n280\n00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.240\nRight?\nWell, here's another one.\n\n281\n00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.240\nIt's called the high-availability chart.\n\n282\n00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.500\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n283\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.100\nSo if you do go to TechNet, and I can make\nthese links available to you guys, so\n\n284\n00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.920\nthat you'll have them.\n\n285\n00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.577\nWe'll put them in the show notes, so that\nif you're not familiar, you can always\n\n286\n00:14:37.577 --> 00:14:41.569\ndo a search out there, in a search engine,\nand just put high availability, Microsoft.\n\n287\n00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:42.871\nAnd it'll take you to this website.\n\n288\n00:14:42.871 --> 00:14:48.328\nNow with this website, you can see,\nabout the highest level that,\n\n289\n00:14:48.328 --> 00:14:53.132\nreally, anybody can give,\nis what's called five nines.\n\n290\n00:14:53.132 --> 00:14:56.490\nAll right, that's 99.999% up time.\n\n291\n00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.280\nNow, there's very few\ncompanies that do that.\n\n292\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.983\nThere was one company that,\na few years back that I seen, and\n\n293\n00:15:02.983 --> 00:15:04.520\nI think it was called Blue Planet.\n\n294\n00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.957\nHas nothing to do with, what,\nDiscover here or anything like that.\n\n295\n00:15:06.957 --> 00:15:11.877\nAnd they would give you\na five nine in their SLA, and\n\n296\n00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:15.430\nit's just a massive organization.\n\n297\n00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.860\nBut anyways, Microsoft doesn't do\nthat because it's just not realistic.\n\n298\n00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:25.243\nWhat they do is that they give\nyou this 99.9%, right here.\n\n299\n00:15:25.243 --> 00:15:29.277\nAnd with that, that lets you know that\nthose numbers [LAUGH] that I rattled off\n\n300\n00:15:29.277 --> 00:15:34.015\nlike I rattled them off from memory and\nyou can see it's eight hours down time.\n\n301\n00:15:34.015 --> 00:15:38.155\nYou can see, I will tell you though if you\nlook at some of their quarterly reports\n\n302\n00:15:38.155 --> 00:15:43.020\nand in fact we did this in a previous\nepisode where you can see according to\n\n303\n00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:48.910\ntheir service level agreement, they say,\nyeah, we're gonna give you 99.9% up time.\n\n304\n00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.650\nWhich, again, means per day.\n\n305\n00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:55.034\nYou're not gonna have anything\nmore than 86 and a half seconds,\n\n306\n00:15:55.034 --> 00:15:58.255\n43 minutes per months or\neight hours per year.\n\n307\n00:15:58.255 --> 00:16:01.115\n>> And looking at those numbers, that's\nnot really great, to be honest with you.\n\n308\n00:16:01.115 --> 00:16:02.555\n>> No, it really isn't [LAUGH].\n\n309\n00:16:02.555 --> 00:16:06.595\nEight hours, well,\nlet's just take 43 minutes, right.\n\n310\n00:16:06.595 --> 00:16:08.515\nImagine a company like British Airways.\n\n311\n00:16:08.515 --> 00:16:12.016\nBritish Airways is one of the companies\nthat uses Microsoft's cloud\n\n312\n00:16:12.016 --> 00:16:15.830\ninfrastructure, and obviously,\nBritish Airways a massive company.\n\n313\n00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.640\nThis is not, we're not talking\nabout small potatoes here,\n\n314\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.420\nwe're talking about\na gigantic organization.\n\n315\n00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.810\nImagine you're being on that airplane, for\n\n316\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.900\n43 minutes they don't have\naccess to any of their data.\n\n317\n00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.640\nHow bad do you think that would upset, or\n\n318\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.808\nthrow off their entire flight plans,\ntheir flight schedules,\n\n319\n00:16:36.808 --> 00:16:41.340\nevery single plane in their data base,\nall the customer information?\n\n320\n00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.200\n>> And\nthen how much money they are losing.\n\n321\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.981\n>> Exactly, so this is a major,\nmajor problem.\n\n322\n00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:53.089\nThat being said, Microsoft,\neven though they tell you 99.9%,\n\n323\n00:16:53.089 --> 00:16:57.082\nlet me make sure I get that right,\n99.9% uptime.\n\n324\n00:16:57.082 --> 00:17:01.642\nWhen they do their quarterly reviews,\nthey're hitting\n\n325\n00:17:01.642 --> 00:17:06.590\ncloser to 99.95, 98, or excuse me, 99.99%.\n\n326\n00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:10.110\nNow when you look at that number,\nit's a little more feasible.\n\n327\n00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.290\nStill not quite the greatest, but\nwhen you look at a cloud service,\n\n328\n00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.610\nnow you're talking about per month,\nfour minutes.\n\n329\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:22.920\nTalking about, we're just moving\nthe decimal point, 8.64 seconds per day.\n\n330\n00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:28.150\nNot too bad, not crazy good but-\n>> They're reasonable.\n\n331\n00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.280\n>> It's reasonable.\n\n332\n00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.125\nWhich I have to commend Microsoft,\nDan mentioned in an earlier episode\n\n333\n00:17:34.125 --> 00:17:38.579\nthat we did, what is it,\nyou under promise and you over deliver.\n\n334\n00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:40.240\n>> That's it.\n>> I think is what you had quoted, and\n\n335\n00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.045\nthat's exactly what they are doing here.\n\n336\n00:17:42.045 --> 00:17:45.940\nThey're saying we are going\nto give you 99.9%, but\n\n337\n00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.360\ndue to our transparency, and transparency\nof operations, we'll show you what our\n\n338\n00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.570\nquarterly reports say on what we actually\nhit, and when you look at those reports,\n\n339\n00:17:54.570 --> 00:18:00.780\nyou can see that they're actually hitting\na lot better, almost to that four nines.\n\n340\n00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.660\nWhich is really only one step below\na five nine, which like I said,\n\n341\n00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.700\nnot many companies out there are gonna\ngive you the five nine experience.\n\n342\n00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:13.170\nBecause it basically means that you have\naccess to your data almost all the time,\n\n343\n00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.550\nand if you don't have access, on\na monthly basis we're talking 26 seconds.\n\n344\n00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.950\nSo you might not even notice that.\n\n345\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.715\nI drop more ping packets in\n26 seconds than services.\n\n346\n00:18:22.715 --> 00:18:27.740\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> High availability, and one more thing,\n\n347\n00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:33.640\nyou can see what they call the level\nof availability, how do they market it,\n\n348\n00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.510\nwhat is more of the industry wide\nstandard of what they call it?\n\n349\n00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.820\nWell commercially they're over the mark,\nbut\n\n350\n00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.627\nthey call it highly available at 99.9%.\n\n351\n00:18:45.627 --> 00:18:51.730\nRemember continuous 100% it's not\ngonna happen, that does not happen.\n\n352\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:57.250\nFault tolerance, fault tolerant there,\nfive nines, five minutes downtime.\n\n353\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.760\nThey're sitting kinda like\nin the middle of the stack,\n\n354\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.750\nin the middle of the scale there.\n\n355\n00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:06.840\nFairly good amount of uptime and\nthey're not over promising and\n\n356\n00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.640\nthen under delivering,\nthey're actually doing it the other way.\n\n357\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.070\nWe do maintain a relative level of access,\nand remember availability is important,\n\n358\n00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:20.360\nbecause availability that crosses many\ndifferent concepts in technology.\n\n359\n00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.080\nOne of the first things I think of,\nand maybe you do, too, Dan, is, again,\n\n360\n00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.890\nsecurity related.\n\n361\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.580\nYour authorized users have to have access\nto their data for your company to succeed.\n\n362\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.830\nIf your authorized users don't\nhave access to their data,\n\n363\n00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.980\nyour business doesn't thrive.\n\n364\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.110\nIn fact, it can go under real quick.\n\n365\n00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:41.040\nSo availability is something that\neven from a security stance is gonna\n\n366\n00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.480\nbe very important, let alone\nproductivity inside of your company.\n\n367\n00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.330\n>> Awesome.\nNow Wes, would you say that Microsoft\n\n368\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.200\nwants you to know, like you did, you\nrattled off those numbers, and then their\n\n369\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.242\ndecimal points, and it was very impressive\nuntil we figured out you cheated.\n\n370\n00:19:54.242 --> 00:19:54.860\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n371\n00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.470\n>> But would you say that Microsoft wants\n\n372\n00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:01.820\nyou to know that, or they just want you to\nbe aware that 99.9 is a standard level,\n\n373\n00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.156\nand then as you go, and adding more nines,\nyou're getting more highly available.\n\n374\n00:20:05.156 --> 00:20:09.900\n>> That's right, you'll notice,\nI would say know the nines, like Dan said.\n\n375\n00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.170\nI think it would be more important to\nknow, what, according to their service\n\n376\n00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:17.440\nlevel agreement that they're offering you,\nand in this case it's that 99.9%.\n\n377\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.770\n>> I don't think you have to worry\non this exam about what they're\n\n378\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.940\nactually giving you, but I would\nknow the industry wide standards for\n\n379\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.760\nwhat they're gonna give you\naccording to their SLA.\n\n380\n00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.610\nBecause if you are, this whole episode\nis about using the cloud services, and\n\n381\n00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.470\nif you don't know what\nthey're offering you,\n\n382\n00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.080\nas far as the service that\nyou'll going to be using,\n\n383\n00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.690\nthen you might get that wrong on the exam,\nand we certainly don't want that.\n\n384\n00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.200\nDan, to answer your question\na little bit more straight there,\n\n385\n00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.317\nI think I would say, just know the 99.9%.\n\n386\n00:20:48.317 --> 00:20:48.900\n>> Gotcha.\n\n387\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.590\nAll right.\nWell, Wes,\n\n388\n00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:52.010\nwe've covered a lot of ground\nwhen it comes to cloud services.\n\n389\n00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:56.450\nIs there anything else that we would need\nto jump into, that we need to be aware of?\n\n390\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.660\nA concept, practice or anything like that?\n\n391\n00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:03.220\n>> Well, one of the big things here\nthat we have to talk about is, and\n\n392\n00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.100\nthey do call this out,\nso I would be aware of.\n\n393\n00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.972\nWhen we talk about this concept of\nconfiguration, we talk about things\n\n394\n00:21:10.972 --> 00:21:16.020\nbeing configurable, and then we also\ntalk about the term customization,\n\n395\n00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.810\nand when it comes to customization,\nwhat is the difference here?\n\n396\n00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:24.940\nWell, in the cloud-based services,\na lot of times, well not lot of times,\n\n397\n00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.420\nthe majority of the time, what we talk\nabout Is the term configurations.\n\n398\n00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.980\nWe can configure things, services.\n\n399\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.350\nWe can set them the way we want to set\nthem, but when it comes to customization,\n\n400\n00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:40.980\nthis typically is something that's\nmore on premise, and that being\n\n401\n00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.780\nthe fact that customization means I have\nto have access to the underlying code.\n\n402\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.610\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n403\n00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:52.282\nIf I'm in,\nlet's say that I'm in Services, and\n\n404\n00:21:52.282 --> 00:21:58.081\nlet me go ahead and open that up,\njust as soon as I find it here.\n\n405\n00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.179\nService Settings, there we go,\nand let's say, that for\n\n406\n00:22:05.179 --> 00:22:09.745\ninstance I wanna do some\nconfiguration on mail.\n\n407\n00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:14.695\nWell, I can configure this,\nI have access, the ability that if\n\n408\n00:22:14.695 --> 00:22:20.060\nI want to maybe set anti-malware policy\nhere, I can configure that policy.\n\n409\n00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:26.270\nSo, as far as this interface goes,\nI can adjust this the way I want.\n\n410\n00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.920\nAnd one of the great things is,\nis let's say Dan's company.\n\n411\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.340\nDan has an Office 365 account.\n\n412\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.800\nWell, when he logs into his account,\nhe's not gonna see my policies.\n\n413\n00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.750\nBecause I'm configuring the policies and\nthey only affect me.\n\n414\n00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:44.640\nHowever, what happens if I\nwanted add something to this?\n\n415\n00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.270\nIf I said I want a couple of links here,\nwell that's a little bit different.\n\n416\n00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.000\nThat would be something that I'll\nhave to have access to code, and\n\n417\n00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.937\nin having access to the code would mean\nthat I have to contact the developers, and\n\n418\n00:22:56.937 --> 00:23:02.020\nbasically, tell them hey, I'm gonna\nmodify your code here a little bit,\n\n419\n00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.230\nbecause I need another jump link.\n\n420\n00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.550\nNow, you typically can't do\nthat inside of the Cloud.\n\n421\n00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.350\nRight?\nIt's not gonna be available to you.\n\n422\n00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.660\nHowever, what if we bump on\nover to the ITProTV site.\n\n423\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:17.210\nWe bump over to the ITProTV site, and this\nis our site, and it's managed on premise.\n\n424\n00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.760\nThis is a little bit different.\n\n425\n00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.180\nImagine if I wanted to make\nmodifications to the ITProTV site.\n\n426\n00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:29.760\nWell, you as a customer, you're on\nthe consumer end of this, connecting\n\n427\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:35.570\nto our software, and what we have\navailable here for you, is what you get.\n\n428\n00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.990\nYou can maybe do some searches here,\n\n429\n00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.950\nyou can sort through the course\nhere by category or tag.\n\n430\n00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:47.275\nYou as a customer, you could make some,\nnot customizations,\n\n431\n00:23:47.275 --> 00:23:51.496\nexcuse me,\nyou could make some configurations,\n\n432\n00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:58.042\nbasic configurations here, but\nwhat you can't do is you can't add things.\n\n433\n00:23:58.042 --> 00:23:59.712\nDan if I was gonna add something to this,\n\n434\n00:23:59.712 --> 00:24:02.182\none of the things that I would\nhave to do is I'd have to what?\n\n435\n00:24:02.182 --> 00:24:06.225\nWe have to go to our dev team and we'd\nhave to say hey I need this functionality,\n\n436\n00:24:06.225 --> 00:24:09.781\nI need a button right here can you\nthink of a button maybe that you might\n\n437\n00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:10.410\nwanna add?\n\n438\n00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.198\n>> Yeah we were actually talking\nabout this a little bit and\n\n439\n00:24:14.198 --> 00:24:17.664\nI was like if we're talking\nabout making a change,\n\n440\n00:24:17.664 --> 00:24:22.661\nan actual customization to the site say\nI wanted to add a link that had all my\n\n441\n00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:27.132\nfavorites to every video on ITProTV\nthat I needed to watch right?\n\n442\n00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:30.170\nSay I'm going through Net Plus and\nI need to,\n\n443\n00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.740\nI really need to go over\nthese three videos.\n\n444\n00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.100\nBe nice if it showed up as soon as I\nlogged in, and those three videos were\n\n445\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.466\nright there, clickable,\nI have just a, like a quick link.\n\n446\n00:24:39.466 --> 00:24:42.030\nIt's not that it's not there, we don't\nhave that, or maybe it is I don't know.\n\n447\n00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.435\nBut it's not,\nI want it right on this page,\n\n448\n00:24:44.435 --> 00:24:48.260\nwhere you see course library\nright next to it, it's there.\n\n449\n00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.510\nWhat would I have to do\nto make that happen, Wes?\n\n450\n00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.600\n>> You have to have access to the code,\nright?\n\n451\n00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.170\nWe would have to, I mean,\n\n452\n00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.280\nyou'd have to be a part of our dev team,\nright, to make that happen.\n\n453\n00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.960\nSo Dan is a customer, he wouldn't\nbe able to have access to the code.\n\n454\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.760\nAnd the same thing goes here if I'm on,\nwell, the opposite, excuse me.\n\n455\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.420\nLet me make sure that\nI'm very clear on that.\n\n456\n00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.980\nI can't do that right,\nif I say you know what,\n\n457\n00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:16.360\nI want to put a,\nmy favorite policies right?\n\n458\n00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.200\nRight here.\nI've got an anti-malware policy,\n\n459\n00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.350\nI've got four that I need to use but\nI don't wanna have to go in,\n\n460\n00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.330\nthe whole entire list every time right.\n\n461\n00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:28.280\nSo, I would have to call up Microsoft and\nsay hey, I need access to your API hero,\n\n462\n00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.300\nI've got some code I\nwanna throw in there but\n\n463\n00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.180\nnow here's a little bit of different,\nright?\n\n464\n00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.370\nIf I'm configuring this,\n\n465\n00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:39.030\nremember Dan's Office 365 isn't gonna\nbe affected by my configurations.\n\n466\n00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:42.560\nBut if I was able to, and\nI'm not, able to modify the code,\n\n467\n00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.210\nnow when Dan logs in,\nnow he's got the jump link, right?\n\n468\n00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.890\nCuz you're adjusting\nthe underlying platform and\n\n469\n00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:53.750\nthat's the difference between\nconfigurations and customizations.\n\n470\n00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.830\nNow let me go ahead and\n\n471\n00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.830\nshow you some customizations that you\ncan do on my company profile here.\n\n472\n00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.510\nAnd hopefully it'll come up there, and\n\n473\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:07.000\nI can make some configurations\nright here on my profile.\n\n474\n00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.821\n>> Yeah you sure can and as I'm looking\nat the screen here I see the word custom.\n\n475\n00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:13.655\n>> Oh, no, now.\n\n476\n00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:14.450\n>> This could be confusing.\n\n477\n00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.450\n>> This could be very confusing.\n\n478\n00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.270\nNow, we got to be careful with this.\n\n479\n00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:18.980\nAll right?\n\n480\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.430\nWhat we are doing and here's where\nit starts to get a little tricky.\n\n481\n00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.040\nAll right?\n\n482\n00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.200\nWe are doing custom configurations.\n\n483\n00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.960\nThis is available to everybody.\n\n484\n00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.940\nIt is a part of the platform.\n\n485\n00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.600\nDon't let this term custom fool you here.\n\n486\n00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.450\nWhy is that?\n\n487\n00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.850\nBecause if I customize my theme, and\n\n488\n00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.850\nhere that's darn word,\nthat pesky word that's bothering us here.\n\n489\n00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:46.925\nIf I customize my theme and Dan logs\ninto a completely separate Office 365,\n\n490\n00:26:46.925 --> 00:26:49.895\nhis account,\nhe's not gonna see the customizations,\n\n491\n00:26:49.895 --> 00:26:52.635\nthe custom configurations that I'm doing.\n\n492\n00:26:52.635 --> 00:26:56.870\nI'm not modifying\nthe underlying platform to make\n\n493\n00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:01.038\nthis available to everybody across\nanybody that's got an Office 365.\n\n494\n00:27:01.038 --> 00:27:05.870\nSo here's where that term gets\na little confusing because you say,\n\n495\n00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.930\nwell, you can configure stuff but\nyou can't customize it.\n\n496\n00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.720\nWell, and then you turn around and\nsee custom theming.\n\n497\n00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.750\nSo it is a custom configuration.\n\n498\n00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:13.610\nI'll tell you what.\n\n499\n00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:14.860\nMaybe we should do a little bit of that?\n\n500\n00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.620\nYou wanna do a little bit of\ncustom configuration here?\n\n501\n00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.280\n>> Custom configuration.\n\n502\n00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.485\n>> So let's show you some of the services\nhere that you can configure.\n\n503\n00:27:20.485 --> 00:27:24.960\nMaybe the first thing that I wanna do, and\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna leave our\n\n504\n00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.260\ncompany information here the same and\nwe're gonna go to custom theming, right.\n\n505\n00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:35.310\nNow, if I want, maybe across the top\nof this, I want our company logo here.\n\n506\n00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.160\nWell, I can do that.\n\n507\n00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.561\nI can select an image.\n\n508\n00:27:37.561 --> 00:27:40.410\nAll right, and\nI've got an image ready to go here for us.\n\n509\n00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.050\nAnd wait for\n\n510\n00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.740\nit there, and now at the top of the screen\nhere I've got our company logo.\n\n511\n00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.660\nWell I can go a little bit\nfarther than that too.\n\n512\n00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.500\nMaybe I want to make sure that everybody,\nand again here's where that term,\n\n513\n00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.410\nlet's not get confused on that\nterm custom configuration.\n\n514\n00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:03.290\nEverybody within my company that has,\nis a user within this\n\n515\n00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:08.785\nOffice 365 account is going\nto see that ITProTV logo.\n\n516\n00:28:08.785 --> 00:28:09.345\nAll right.\n\n517\n00:28:09.345 --> 00:28:16.255\nMaybe Dan's company is working on the\nnext, latest and greatest game platform.\n\n518\n00:28:16.255 --> 00:28:19.015\nRight?\nOr gaming system or something like that.\n\n519\n00:28:19.015 --> 00:28:21.447\nWell, he's not gonna see that for\nhis company.\n\n520\n00:28:21.447 --> 00:28:22.427\nWhy?\n\n521\n00:28:22.427 --> 00:28:24.467\nIt's a custom configuration.\n\n522\n00:28:24.467 --> 00:28:26.307\nIt's not me modifying the code.\n\n523\n00:28:26.307 --> 00:28:27.857\nAnd I can go even farther than this too.\n\n524\n00:28:27.857 --> 00:28:29.497\nI could type in a link.\n\n525\n00:28:29.497 --> 00:28:31.527\nMaybe I want that to be clickable for\n\n526\n00:28:31.527 --> 00:28:36.357\neverybody who logs in\nto our platform here.\n\n527\n00:28:36.357 --> 00:28:40.327\nSo we'll go ahead and put ITPro.TV there.\n\n528\n00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:46.270\nAnd maybe I want to prevent users\nfrom overwriting this custom theming.\n\n529\n00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.592\nYou've got to love that word.\n\n530\n00:28:47.592 --> 00:28:51.860\nAll right and maybe we want to leave\nthat accent color the way it is, and\n\n531\n00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.580\nwe'll go more to what our company's\ncolor configurations are.\n\n532\n00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.970\nMaybe I want to make that orange.\n\n533\n00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.700\nRight.\nSo, I can change that.\n\n534\n00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.840\nNow, that's a great thing to have,\nand when I save this.\n\n535\n00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.860\nNow one of the things that\nyou'll see is if I go back to.\n\n536\n00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.435\nLet's say if I get out\nof the Admin Console.\n\n537\n00:29:08.435 --> 00:29:11.600\nI'm gonna get out of the Admin Console,\nwhat other users would see if they log\n\n538\n00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.970\ninto something like,\nfor instance, Outlook.\n\n539\n00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.870\nAll right.\n\n540\n00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.080\nIf I give it a second here.\n\n541\n00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:16.920\nOh, you know what?\n\n542\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.750\nI didn't save the customized theme.\n\n543\n00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.140\nGot to save your changes.\n\n544\n00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.398\n>> It does help.\n>> Ctrl+S is your friend.\n\n545\n00:29:21.398 --> 00:29:22.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just in case you guys don't\n\n546\n00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:23.290\nknow out there.\n\n547\n00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.695\nI can help you out with that.\n\n548\n00:29:27.854 --> 00:29:31.553\nAll right, now one other things that\nthey do say is it does take a second so\n\n549\n00:29:31.553 --> 00:29:34.820\nI was probably just a little\nbit too impatient with that.\n\n550\n00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.270\nI've said that many times, faster\ncomputers get the more impatient I get.\n\n551\n00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.940\nAll right, now and\n\n552\n00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:46.630\nwhat this does is it's a configurable\nsetting that everybody sees.\n\n553\n00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.190\nWe might have to give it\na little bit longer there but\n\n554\n00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.840\nwe'll try to see if we login to Word.\n\n555\n00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.150\nIt doesn't look like it's updated yet,\n\n556\n00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.810\nbut one of the good thing is\nthe logo shows up fairly fast here.\n\n557\n00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:00.410\nDoesn't look like it showed up so\njust have to wait a little bit longer.\n\n558\n00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:04.250\nNow the other cool thing that we\ncan do too is custom tiles right.\n\n559\n00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.210\nI can do a custom tile if I want to,\n\n560\n00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:10.765\nmaybe I wanna make sure that when\neverybody logs into the machine, or\n\n561\n00:30:10.765 --> 00:30:15.230\ninto Office 365, they've got a customized\ntile, well we can do that as well.\n\n562\n00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:20.295\nSo I can say, okay, let's say,\nwe'll just call ITPro.\n\n563\n00:30:25.194 --> 00:30:27.075\nTV.\n\n564\n00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:31.705\nAll right, and we'll take the the URL,\nso you'll notice it's\n\n565\n00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:36.351\npretty much close to the same thing\nas what we were doing before.\n\n566\n00:30:37.616 --> 00:30:42.900\nDot TV, description we'll\ncall this company website.\n\n567\n00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.510\nAnd then what I can do is, I actually\nhave over here on our SharePoint site,\n\n568\n00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.870\nI've set up a location for an image.\n\n569\n00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:58.530\nAnd I can copy that, paste that URL,\nand submit the changes.\n\n570\n00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:03.000\nAnd then once I submit those changes,\nthis is kinda cool,\n\n571\n00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.960\nI can go back to my app launcher,\nchoose view all apps,\n\n572\n00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:13.120\nand there's my customized tile,\n\n573\n00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.630\nas you can see I clicked on it,\ntook me right over to our website.\n\n574\n00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:22.000\nBut what I meant to do here is\nadd that to the app launcher.\n\n575\n00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.390\nSo now if I go back to my app launcher,\neverybody that logs into the,\n\n576\n00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.460\ninto Office 365 is gonna\nsee my customized tile.\n\n577\n00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:36.000\nNow I noticed I customized and\nadded a tile that I just made, right?\n\n578\n00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.750\nI can't change the tiles over here, right.\n\n579\n00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.670\nThat would be where\nthe customization comes in and\n\n580\n00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.000\nthe fact that I'd have to\nhave access to the code.\n\n581\n00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.750\nSo be careful with those terms here.\n\n582\n00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.380\nI know it does get confusing.\n\n583\n00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.660\nSo you do have the ability to make\nconfiguration changes to your service that\n\n584\n00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.770\ndoesn't affect another tenant that\nhas an Office 365, an account.\n\n585\n00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:00.040\nTo make a customization that's\ntypically on-premise, and\n\n586\n00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.270\nthat is something that, basically\nyou have to have access to the code.\n\n587\n00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:08.820\nWe here at ITProTV, we can make\ncustomizations to our platform,\n\n588\n00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.540\nour website, that you guys connect to,\nbut you guys can configure it.\n\n589\n00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:20.210\nYou can set a tag, change the way you\nsearch, maybe change your password.\n\n590\n00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.380\nRight?\nThose are configurable settings.\n\n591\n00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.730\nYou're not customizing anything.\n\n592\n00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:26.460\nSo I will say,\nI know that's a confusing term there.\n\n593\n00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.870\nJust be careful with that.\n\n594\n00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:31.620\nIt ultimately boils down to whether\nyou have access to the code or not.\n\n595\n00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.900\n>> Yeah, Wes.\nIt sounds like what you're saying is that\n\n596\n00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:39.370\nwith customization, I have the ability\nto actually affect the service.\n\n597\n00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.900\nI can change the service itself,\nunderlying in the way and\n\n598\n00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.960\nthe nature of it.\n\n599\n00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.840\nIt's where configuration is\nthere is an option inside\n\n600\n00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:53.050\nof the service that's already there and\nI can just modify it to my liking.\n\n601\n00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.280\nAnd that's the difference too, I'm not\nmaking an actual change to the service\n\n602\n00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.200\nitself, just a, a more like, and\nWes has red and I have blue.\n\n603\n00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.738\n>> Yep.\n>> The service is still the same,\n\n604\n00:33:02.738 --> 00:33:07.040\nit's just Wes' is red and\nmine is blue, that's configuration.\n\n605\n00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.650\nIt's a custom configuration\nbecause Wes chose red,\n\n606\n00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:12.120\nI chose blue, great that's nice.\n\n607\n00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.920\nBut we're not changing\nthe underlying service.\n\n608\n00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.080\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n609\n00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.220\nYou don't have access to change something\nthat ultimately will affect everybody,\n\n610\n00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.230\nevery customer that has\nan Office 365 account.\n\n611\n00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:22.060\n>> All right.\n\n612\n00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:22.860\nWell, Wes, this is.\n\n613\n00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.085\nI know it can sound a little confusing.\n\n614\n00:33:25.085 --> 00:33:26.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a little daunting.\n\n615\n00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.820\nDon't let it overwhelm you.\n\n616\n00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:28.790\nJust take in.\n\n617\n00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.670\nAs long as you understand\nthe basic concepts.\n\n618\n00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.980\nYou don't need to know how to change\ntiles or colors or anything like that.\n\n619\n00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.150\nWe just want you to make sure that\nyou know what the difference between\n\n620\n00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:42.260\ncustomization and configuration\nis when it comes to exam time.\n\n621\n00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.640\nWant to make sure you have\nthat differentiation down.\n\n622\n00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.750\nWes is there anything\nelse we need to go over?\n\n623\n00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:47.710\n>> No.\n>> Before we close the show.\n\n624\n00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.500\n>> No,\nI think we've covered it on that one.\n\n625\n00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.170\n>> All right, well thank you so\nmuch for explaining this to us.\n\n626\n00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.720\nCloud concepts can be very,\n\n627\n00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.680\nvery difficult to understand and\nI think you did a really good job.\n\n628\n00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.360\nI appreciate you showing up for this show.\n\n629\n00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.010\nWe definitely appreciate\nour viewers out there.\n\n630\n00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.440\nThank you so much for watching.\n\n631\n00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.940\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nclose it down, though.\n\n632\n00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.950\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n633\n00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:06.620\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n634\n00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.150\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n635\n00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:14.320\n[MUSIC].\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.073 --> 00:00:19.741\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:23.040\nwe're continuing on with our\nMTA Cloud Fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.570\nAnd joining me here in the studio yet\n\n6\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.550\nagain is none other than\nWes the Weatherman, Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.190\n[LAUGH] Welcome to the studio, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.750\n>> The weather's great today, Dan.\n\n9\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.620\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna\nbe talking about cloud updates and\n\n10\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.330\navailability.\n\n11\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.540\nAnd it's gonna be important,\nthese concepts, when we think about it,\n\n12\n00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.680\nbecause imagine this.\n\n13\n00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.760\nThey're gonna be rolling out\nupdates to your platforms.\n\n14\n00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.860\nYou're gonna, as a paying customer,\nwe've talked about availability and\n\n15\n00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.440\nhaving access to that information,\nyour different applications, and\n\n16\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.070\nthere is a way that you can monitor and\nmaintain that.\n\n17\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.750\nBut, we're gonna go ahead and\ntake a step back and we're gonna revisit.\n\n18\n00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.640\nWhen we talk about cloud services, what\ndo we mean when we say cloud services?\n\n19\n00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.809\nWell, we're gonna start at the bottom\nof the cloud computing stack, and\n\n20\n00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.040\nwe'll start with, remember,\nthe infrastructure as a service, right.\n\n21\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.432\nThis is where your VMs and your hardware\ncomes into place, as far as hey,\n\n22\n00:01:10.432 --> 00:01:13.384\nI need a virtual machine,\nI need it configured,\n\n23\n00:01:13.384 --> 00:01:16.128\nas well as things like\nplatform as a service.\n\n24\n00:01:16.128 --> 00:01:19.260\nRemember that platform as a service,\nwe need to develop things like\n\n25\n00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.060\napplications or\nyour company might need to.\n\n26\n00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.550\nAnd you need that run time and\nexecution environment in order for\n\n27\n00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.360\nthose applications to run.\n\n28\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.890\nThen finally one of the top\nof the cloud computing stack,\n\n29\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.140\nwhich is what your end users most commonly\nare going to be interacting with,\n\n30\n00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.790\nis the software of the service.\n\n31\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.390\nSo keep in mind those three services.\n\n32\n00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.160\nThe infrastructure as a service,\nplatform as a service, and\n\n33\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.600\nalso the software as a service.\n\n34\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.170\n>> Yeah, that's right,\nthat we have all three of those.\n\n35\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.211\nYou gotta make sure that you're\nunderstanding each one of those,\n\n36\n00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:50.480\nso it's a good idea\nthat we revisited that.\n\n37\n00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.450\nBut Wes, is there an order of operations\nwith which we should tackle this, or\n\n38\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.940\ndoes anything go?\n\n39\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.530\n>> Well, there really is a good\norder of operations, if you will,\n\n40\n00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.390\nbecause we gotta look at\na couple of concepts, right?\n\n41\n00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.190\nWe gotta look at responsibility.\n\n42\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.560\nThat's really what it comes down to.\n\n43\n00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.700\nAnd when I say a couple of concepts\nis customer responsibility,\n\n44\n00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.490\nthe person that is paying the monthly\nsubscription for the service versus what\n\n45\n00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.480\nthe provider's responsibility is to\nthe customer that you might be paying.\n\n46\n00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.108\nSo one of the first ones we gotta look\nat is infrastructure as a service and\n\n47\n00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:24.677\nthat meaning that there are some\nresponsibilities that are a little bit\n\n48\n00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.900\ndifferent than the other services\nthat are provided, right?\n\n49\n00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.280\nSo if you think about\ninfrastructure as a service, and\n\n50\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.400\nmaybe I need a web server,\nright, so what do I do?\n\n51\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.170\nWe go to something like\nthe Azure login page,\n\n52\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.650\nyour administration page, and\nyou spin up a virtual machine.\n\n53\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.920\nMaybe you have to put,\nwhat is it, IIS on it, or\n\n54\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.210\nmaybe you gotta spin up\nan Apache machine out there.\n\n55\n00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.910\nWell you do the configurations, right?\n\n56\n00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.540\nWell what is your responsibility?\n\n57\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.420\nWell when it comes to that as that\nportion of the cloud computing stack,\n\n58\n00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.500\nyou have to think about it this way.\n\n59\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.340\nWhat if you bring up a web server,\nright, and\n\n60\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.020\nyou've provisioned it basically to support\na certain amount of performance, right?\n\n61\n00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.320\nAnd then all of a sudden, you get just\na massive amount of traffic, right?\n\n62\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.680\nWe want success here.\n\n63\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.830\nWell, imagine your success is overnight.\n\n64\n00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.260\nWell, now I've got a web server out\nthere that maybe isn't performing\n\n65\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.260\nthe way I want it to.\n\n66\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.850\nIt can't service all of those individual\n\n67\n00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.200\nrequests from people\nconstantly visiting it.\n\n68\n00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.826\nWell, that's my\nresponsibility as a customer.\n\n69\n00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:34.243\nRight, the other thing that comes along\nwith that too, as the customer is,\n\n70\n00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:37.487\nimagine the operating system\nthat's running on that or\n\n71\n00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:42.269\nthe application that's running inside of\nthat server or even a modular add-on.\n\n72\n00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.828\nMaybe you've got a Windows 2012 Server R2,\nand\n\n73\n00:03:45.828 --> 00:03:49.190\nyou've got a role that you've configured.\n\n74\n00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.540\nWell, you need to make sure that,\nas a customer,\n\n75\n00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.920\nyou're configuring that right and\nthat's not the provider's problem.\n\n76\n00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.360\nAlso, when updates come out, right,\nyou guys, probably familiar,\n\n77\n00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.090\nthat computers, operating systems,\nare constantly updating.\n\n78\n00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.960\nWell, you've gotta worry about that, too.\n\n79\n00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.300\nThat's not the provider's job to\nupdate a certain functionality,\n\n80\n00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.680\nor even the operating system itself.\n\n81\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.600\nSo, you do have other things.\n\n82\n00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.020\nSo, you gotta, for instance,\npatches, right, security.\n\n83\n00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.240\nIt isn't gonna be Microsoft that is gonna\ncome in and run the security configuration\n\n84\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.750\nwizard inside of your server\nthat you've just configured,\n\n85\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.810\nmaking sure that it is secure.\n\n86\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.600\nThat's your responsibility.\n\n87\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.720\nNow, on the provider's side,\nnow the provider does\n\n88\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.320\nhave some kinda responsibility in\ninfrastructure as a service, right?\n\n89\n00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.230\nThe underlying hardware that you don't\nsee, they have to maintain, right?\n\n90\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.310\nThe servers that are running\nyour virtualized servers,\n\n91\n00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.180\nthey need to maintain.\n\n92\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.420\nThey need to maintain things\nlike the network connection so\n\n93\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.420\nthat you can connect to it.\n\n94\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.210\nSo when we look at the infrastructure\nas a service, that first one Dan,\n\n95\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.720\nthis is one of those types of\ncloud services that, well,\n\n96\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.810\nthere is something, a lot of it that's\nin the customer's side of the court.\n\n97\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.650\nThe basketball court if you will.\n\n98\n00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.730\nAt the same time,\n\n99\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.640\nthere's also some that's on the provider\nside of the basketball court as well.\n\n100\n00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.530\n>> Yeah, it's really interesting\nhow the two of us actually get to\n\n101\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.770\nwork together, right?\n\n102\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.620\nMe as a customer or you as a customer and\nthen the service provider themselves.\n\n103\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.120\nThey have the platform, right?\n\n104\n00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.070\nThey've got that hardware, if a hard drive\ngoes dead, I don't have to get up at 2 AM,\n\n105\n00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.640\nthank goodness, and\ngo replace a hard drive.\n\n106\n00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.520\nAnd for one thing, that would be very,\nvery difficult cuz my server is probably\n\n107\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.890\nin another state and\nmaybe even in another country.\n\n108\n00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.630\nThat would be a little bit difficult for\nme to maintain\n\n109\n00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.000\nsome level of availability through\nmaking sure the hardware's running.\n\n110\n00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.200\nThat's the service provider's\nresponsibility, right?\n\n111\n00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.990\nThat's what I'm paying for.\n\n112\n00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.490\nAnd I'm getting a crack team of highly\ntrained, highly skilled individuals\n\n113\n00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.360\nthat are making sure that those things\nremain available and up to date.\n\n114\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.330\nSo, if there's like, where Wes said,\n\n115\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.520\nwe got hypervisors that are running\nall of our virtual machines.\n\n116\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.510\nI might have a, so like you said,\na server 2012 R2 machine, but\n\n117\n00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.930\nthat's running on\na virtualized environment.\n\n118\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.500\nThat's a virtual server running\non top of a hypervisor.\n\n119\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.900\nThat's in a real, physical server\nsomewhere in this world happening.\n\n120\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.330\nWho takes care of the hypervisor?\n\n121\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.220\nThat isn't me,\nit's the service provider themself.\n\n122\n00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.630\nSo Microsoft's gonna handle that.\n\n123\n00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.960\nThose are the things\nthey're responsible for.\n\n124\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.870\nI am responsible though for\nmaintaining my software updates.\n\n125\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.540\nI've installed software,\nI've gotta make sure it stays up to date.\n\n126\n00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.150\nThat it runs correctly, that it's secure.\n\n127\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.010\nIf antivirus is needed,\nthat's gotta be done.\n\n128\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.180\nThat's on me as a customer.\n\n129\n00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.270\nSo we kind of work hand in hand with that.\n\n130\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.003\nAnd it's a good thing cuz I don't want\nthem making decisions about my environment\n\n131\n00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:39.529\nthat I don't think is right, maybe they\nhave a different velocity of design or\n\n132\n00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.400\nimplementation that I don't.\n\n133\n00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.955\nIt could be different, so\nit's good that you have that ability.\n\n134\n00:06:44.955 --> 00:06:48.385\nBut that's the whole nature of\ninfrastructure as a service\n\n135\n00:06:48.385 --> 00:06:51.155\nthat leads us into the other\nplatforms as well.\n\n136\n00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:52.035\n>> That's right.\n\n137\n00:06:52.035 --> 00:06:55.045\nThe second one, the middle of the stack,\nyou can see, platform as a service.\n\n138\n00:06:55.045 --> 00:06:57.215\nKeep in mind that we have our hardware.\n\n139\n00:06:57.215 --> 00:07:00.895\nWe have operating systems, but\nnow we have applications that need to run.\n\n140\n00:07:00.895 --> 00:07:05.090\nAnd platform as a service is one that when\nit really comes down to it, the majority\n\n141\n00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.920\nof the problems that might happen\nare really on the provider side, right?\n\n142\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.363\nThey need to make sure that the runtime\nenvironment is there and available.\n\n143\n00:07:14.363 --> 00:07:16.893\nBut there is a small portion of it,\nobviously,\n\n144\n00:07:16.893 --> 00:07:20.896\nthat is going to be customer driven,\nand the customer has to be aware of it.\n\n145\n00:07:20.896 --> 00:07:23.248\nLike for instance,\nMember Platform is a service,\n\n146\n00:07:23.248 --> 00:07:25.510\nhelps you to develop applications, right?\n\n147\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.090\nAnd your dev team doesn't wanna have to\nspend the time in building the environment\n\n148\n00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.120\nanytime they test an application,\nonly to test it to have it fail, and\n\n149\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.380\nthen have to rebuild it again.\n\n150\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.430\nWell, that doesn't really change too much\nin the cloud, the difference is you've got\n\n151\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.660\nthe benefit of templates and\nvirtualization, so you can roll it back.\n\n152\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.110\nSo there is some portion\nof it that is the customer.\n\n153\n00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.374\nApplications are developed wrong,\n\n154\n00:07:46.374 --> 00:07:48.289\nthat's not gonna be Microsoft's\nproblem to get in there.\n\n155\n00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:52.224\nTheir dev team gets in there and\nfigures out where your code went wrong and\n\n156\n00:07:52.224 --> 00:07:53.329\nwhat you did wrong.\n\n157\n00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:54.629\nThey're not gonna troubleshoot that for\nyou.\n\n158\n00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:56.266\nThat's up to you to troubleshoot.\n\n159\n00:07:56.266 --> 00:08:00.651\nOn their end, what they need to manage and\nmaintain is to make sure that execution\n\n160\n00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:05.293\nenvironment, regardless of the language,\nyou know, that their API that allows you\n\n161\n00:08:05.293 --> 00:08:10.090\nto connect to that run-time environment is\navailable and they manage and maintain it.\n\n162\n00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.000\nSo this is one of the ones\nwhere you look at it,\n\n163\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.700\nand it starts at the bottom of the stack,\nright,\n\n164\n00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.640\nmore responsibility on the customer's end,\nand this starts to reduce a little bit,\n\n165\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.130\nwhere there is some level of\ncustomer responsibility then, but\n\n166\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:28.400\nstill the responsibility lies more with\nthe provider when it comes to platform.\n\n167\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.530\n>> Yeah, it's a very little responsibility\nwhen it comes to the customer with PaaS,\n\n168\n00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.730\nright because what's provided by PaaS?\n\n169\n00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.170\nIt is the virtual machine,\nthe virtual environment on which\n\n170\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.940\nthe platform of whatever you're running,\nC++ or\n\n171\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.210\nJava or Ruby on Rails, or all of these\ndifferent environments that are available,\n\n172\n00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.570\nthat is provided by them so,\nthey're responsible for maintaining it.\n\n173\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.480\nNow, this can get confusing I know.\n\n174\n00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.400\nBecause if I'm running IaaS,\nI can provision a virtual machine,\n\n175\n00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.970\nput a server on there, install Python,\nand then start developing applications.\n\n176\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.280\nAnd you're thinking, great,\nnow it's basically platform as a service.\n\n177\n00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.530\nI can get them to maintain my server and,\nno that's now how it works.\n\n178\n00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.100\nSo don't get confused by that.\n\n179\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.924\nIf you're running\ninfrastructure as a service,\n\n180\n00:09:13.924 --> 00:09:18.163\nif you're provisioning virtual\nmachines and installing environments,\n\n181\n00:09:18.163 --> 00:09:22.534\nlike Wes said, run-time environments,\nthe APIs, the C++, the Javas,\n\n182\n00:09:22.534 --> 00:09:27.130\nthe Rubys, the Pythons, it's your job\nat that point to maintain those things.\n\n183\n00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.330\nKeep them up to date and\nmake sure they're operational.\n\n184\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.690\nIt's not Microsoft's job to do that,\nat that point.\n\n185\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.664\nIf you choose platform as a service where\nthey provide you a pre-built platform,\n\n186\n00:09:37.664 --> 00:09:40.320\nthen it does fall on their shoulders.\n\n187\n00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.004\nThey are responsible, at that point,\n\n188\n00:09:42.004 --> 00:09:44.923\nbecause all they do is providing you\nan area and which to develop on.\n\n189\n00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:48.059\nTheir developers are gonna go in and\ntheir gonna create an application.\n\n190\n00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:51.403\nNow, if the application goes crazy,\nit doesn't do what they expect it to do,\n\n191\n00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:53.170\nthat's customer end service, right?\n\n192\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.720\nThey need to check their code, need to\nfigure out where it went wrong, debug,\n\n193\n00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.850\ndo whatever they have to do, and then\nget their application to work correctly.\n\n194\n00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.210\nBut as long as the virtual\nmachine is working correctly and\n\n195\n00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.705\nthe platform that it's running\non is working correctly,\n\n196\n00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:08.565\nthe provider has done their job and\nthe rest is left up to you.\n\n197\n00:10:08.565 --> 00:10:10.965\n>> That's right, and\nyou know that bring us to well,\n\n198\n00:10:10.965 --> 00:10:14.765\nthe final portion of\nthe cloud computing stack.\n\n199\n00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:19.043\nAnd really we're focused in Office 365 and\nthings like Microsoft's Intune,\n\n200\n00:10:19.043 --> 00:10:20.850\nthe software as a service.\n\n201\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.870\nNow when you look, if you had to\nlook at it like a scale there,\n\n202\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:29.400\nyou're gonna see that the majority, all\nright, of the responsibility really lies\n\n203\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.240\nwithin the provider's network and within\nthe provider's infrastructure, right.\n\n204\n00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.670\nLet's go ahead and step back a second and\n\n205\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.690\ntalk about infrastructure\nas a service here.\n\n206\n00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:38.720\nIf I apply a patch,\n\n207\n00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.260\nif I apply an update to one of the virtual\nmachines that I'm running my software on\n\n208\n00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.050\nand that patch causes a problem,\nwhatever the functionality is.\n\n209\n00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.220\nWe went ahead and we did an update or\nwe did a security patch or\n\n210\n00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.070\nsomething like that, and\nit breaks the service that's running.\n\n211\n00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.760\nWell, the problem is,\nI can't call Microsoft and\n\n212\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.640\nsay, hey, I've got a problem\nwith my Apache server or\n\n213\n00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.050\nI applied an update or\nwhat I though was a fix to this program.\n\n214\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.000\nThey're going to say, well,\n\n215\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.990\nthat's gonna be probably something\nyou're gonna have to deal with.\n\n216\n00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:14.710\nBut on the other hand, that brings us\ninto the updating of the cloud itself.\n\n217\n00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.730\nNow, when we talk about\nupdates to Office 365,\n\n218\n00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.170\nthat's really a hands-off approach from\nthe customer's perspective, right?\n\n219\n00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.200\nFrom the customer's perspective, what\nwe're gonna do is just be notified, right?\n\n220\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.090\nAnd that's some of the things we\nwant to look at when we look at\n\n221\n00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.830\nhow the updates happen in the cloud and\nhow we can monitor and maintain or\n\n222\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.210\ntry to maintain in the availability.\n\n223\n00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:42.000\nSo let's go ahead, I think one of the\nfirst things we should do is tackle how\n\n224\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.400\nMicrosoft handles their updates or\nservice improvements.\n\n225\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.300\nBecause it's something\nthat's really good to know.\n\n226\n00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.400\nAnd you have a limited set of options\nwhen it comes to it, in Office 365,\n\n227\n00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.030\nas to what you can and can't do.\n\n228\n00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.090\nNow-\n>> Wes, do we have any responsibility,\n\n229\n00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.820\nas a customer,\nwhen it comes to updates and availability?\n\n230\n00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.860\n>> No.\nNo, when it comes to the updates and\n\n231\n00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:10.110\nthe availability, when you get to software\nas a service, that's really going to be\n\n232\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:15.120\nunder that high availability that\nwe talked about, that 99.9% uptime.\n\n233\n00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.524\nBecause what we're really doing\nis just configuring, right?\n\n234\n00:12:19.524 --> 00:12:24.890\nWe're configuring the software, why not\nupdating the entire Office365 platform?\n\n235\n00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.320\nBecause that affects everybody worldwide\nand that's where the provider,\n\n236\n00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.640\nthe development team that's part\nof the provider's organization,\n\n237\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.730\nthey're gonna manage and maintain that.\n\n238\n00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.720\nNow, if you need to be aware of how they\ndo updates, they make it fairly easy for\n\n239\n00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.230\nyou so that you're not left blind, right?\n\n240\n00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.930\nIf we're doing a patch\nmanagement system on-premise,\n\n241\n00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.010\nwe have a pretty strict process, right?\n\n242\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.614\nWe have to approve,\nfirst select the patches, right?\n\n243\n00:12:51.614 --> 00:12:54.400\nWe've gotta go through testing,\nthey've gotta be approved, and\n\n244\n00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.970\nthen we roll them to deployment.\n\n245\n00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.470\nWell, that doesn't change.\n\n246\n00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.100\nRight?\n\n247\n00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.550\nWe don't have,\ncuz we go magically to the cloud,\n\n248\n00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.620\nall of a sudden that that patch management\nand update process completely changes.\n\n249\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.010\nIt's just it's being\nmanaged by the provider.\n\n250\n00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.940\nAnd they do make it transparent so\nyou know what to expect.\n\n251\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.880\nSo I've gone ahead and\n\n252\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.790\nI've pulled up on TechNet the Office\n365 Service Updates section here.\n\n253\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.830\nAnd they've got some information\nhere about First Release.\n\n254\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:26.100\nBut one of the things that they\ndon't mention is that in Office 365,\n\n255\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:33.320\nyou have a few different formats for\nhow updates are released.\n\n256\n00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.762\nYou have two different kinds.\n\n257\n00:13:34.762 --> 00:13:38.150\nThey're called a standard release and\nthe first release they mention right here.\n\n258\n00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:43.690\nLet me go ahead and show you that\ninside of the Office 365 platform here.\n\n259\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:48.770\nNow, when it comes to updates, believe\nit or not, this is a service setting.\n\n260\n00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.530\nSo again, I'm not gonna actually\ndo the updates themselves but\n\n261\n00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:58.460\nI can make some configurations\n\n262\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.710\non how I want to receive those updates,\nbut I don't have to implement them.\n\n263\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:06.770\nSo if we go down to our service settings\nhere, notice that in the middle\n\n264\n00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.560\nof all these cloud based services,\nright, I've got Skype for business here,\n\n265\n00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.390\nif you're doing DRM, Digital Rights\nManagement, I've got updates.\n\n266\n00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.722\nWhen I go to updates,\nit gives me a couple of options here.\n\n267\n00:14:18.722 --> 00:14:22.050\nAnd I want to talk about\nthe different options that we have.\n\n268\n00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.420\nNow, you might have seen in the TechNet\narticle, they mentioned first release.\n\n269\n00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.650\nOkay, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust skip over that one for\n\n270\n00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.740\na second because this is the one\nthat you can see that I've chose for\n\n271\n00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.780\nthe organization that we've created here.\n\n272\n00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.550\nStandard release.\n\n273\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.540\nOkay.\n\n274\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.480\nEven if you're on-premise, when you do\npatch managements and updates like that,\n\n275\n00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.050\nagain it's a pretty big process, right?\n\n276\n00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:48.300\nYou have to take it to a patch\nmanagement team, they need to review and\n\n277\n00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.590\nfind out what is going to be released,\nand improve it, you have to test it, and\n\n278\n00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.710\nthen you have to deploy it\nafter it's been tested.\n\n279\n00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.890\nWell, that's pretty much what\nthe standard release process is.\n\n280\n00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.500\nBut you don't have to deal\nwith all that backend stuff.\n\n281\n00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.030\nIt says that when they release an update,\n\n282\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.530\nit's not pushed out to you immediately,\nright?\n\n283\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:11.310\nIt usually takes a week, so you can\nget some time, they say within a week.\n\n284\n00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.210\nA lot of times it's a few weeks.\n\n285\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.100\nWell, this gives your team\nthe chance to kind of review some of\n\n286\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.640\nthe documentation that\nthey're gonna push out.\n\n287\n00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.570\nAnd I'll show you where some of that\ndocumentation is on how they're going to\n\n288\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.950\npush this out to your end systems.\n\n289\n00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.790\nNow, if you're an early adopter, right?\n\n290\n00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.090\n[LAUGH] And\nyou gotta be very careful with this one,\n\n291\n00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.560\nyou can always choose the first release.\n\n292\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.090\nOkay, now the first release, you have\nto be careful with this one, right.\n\n293\n00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.840\nBecause sometimes they're still in,\nthey don't give you that week, that time,\n\n294\n00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.645\nthat couple of weeks\nbefore they push it out.\n\n295\n00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:48.885\nIt means the moment we release it, we're\ngonna push it right out to your system.\n\n296\n00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:50.197\nAnd there are other things there also.\n\n297\n00:15:50.197 --> 00:15:52.758\nSo keep in mind that when\nwe say first release,\n\n298\n00:15:52.758 --> 00:15:55.525\nyou're gonna get this\nbefore anybody else does.\n\n299\n00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:58.813\nNow, one of the things to keep\nin mind between both of these,\n\n300\n00:15:58.813 --> 00:16:02.681\nwhich ever one you choose is that,\nhow fast you receive those updates,\n\n301\n00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:06.893\nis really contingent on things like,\nwhat service plan do you have, right?\n\n302\n00:16:06.893 --> 00:16:08.628\nSo, what subscription plan do you have,\n\n303\n00:16:08.628 --> 00:16:11.130\nbecause maybe the subscription\nplan doesn't affect you.\n\n304\n00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:15.500\nMaybe whatever the release is\naffects this online web apps,\n\n305\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.000\nwell, or maybe it affects Skype for\nBusiness.\n\n306\n00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.470\nWell if your company's not using Skype for\n\n307\n00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.880\nBusiness, that's never gonna affect you,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n308\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.468\nIt also depends on things\nlike geographical region,\n\n309\n00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:29.983\nbecause they don't just push it out\nto the world collectively, right?\n\n310\n00:16:29.983 --> 00:16:31.957\nWe're gonna do different regions as and\n\n311\n00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:35.010\nthen they'll distribute\nit as they see fit.\n\n312\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.710\nNow, one of the things\nabout first releases is\n\n313\n00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:42.380\nthat you have to be careful with is doing\nan entire organization first release.\n\n314\n00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:44.550\nIt's up to you, but\n\n315\n00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:49.065\nI would kinda warn you on this one, but\nI would probably do a select people.\n\n316\n00:16:49.065 --> 00:16:52.875\nWhen it comes to select people,\nwe might wanna issue this out to, say,\n\n317\n00:16:52.875 --> 00:16:54.149\nour IT staff, right.\n\n318\n00:16:54.149 --> 00:16:58.195\nWe wanna issue this first release of this\nupdate to people that are technically\n\n319\n00:16:58.195 --> 00:17:02.722\nsavvy enough that if we have to ask\nthem questions, how's it going, right?\n\n320\n00:17:02.722 --> 00:17:03.756\nWe don't get answers like,\n\n321\n00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:06.430\nwell the doamahicky next to the thing\nthingamajiggers kinda blinking and\n\n322\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.952\nit's going blinking and blink, right.\n\n323\n00:17:07.952 --> 00:17:12.222\nWell, that really doesn't do anything for\nhow this release is so, you might say,\n\n324\n00:17:12.222 --> 00:17:14.362\nI'm gonna make a group.\n\n325\n00:17:14.362 --> 00:17:19.517\nAnd I'm gonna select that group of\npeople to receive that update first.\n\n326\n00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:26.880\nSo again, when you, be very careful\non the updates that you choose.\n\n327\n00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.690\nStandard release, like I said,\nis a little bit more\n\n328\n00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:33.670\nsafe just because it gives your\nteam a little bit of time to plan.\n\n329\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.780\nThey don't just push this update out and\nnot warn you,\n\n330\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.510\nthey'll let you know ahead of time.\n\n331\n00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.380\nAnd again,\nit gives you some time to prepare.\n\n332\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.570\nFirst release,\nthis is where you're the early adopter.\n\n333\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.310\nAnd the problem is, with the early\nadoption not only do you early adopt\n\n334\n00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.600\nthe update, you could adopt very\nearly all the problems that come\n\n335\n00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.390\nalong with the update if it hasn't\nbeen thoroughly tested yet.\n\n336\n00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.180\nThat's right.\n\n337\n00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.890\nPlus, it's nice that they\ngive you that leverage.\n\n338\n00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.560\nYou wanna be on the bleeding edge?\n\n339\n00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.560\nNot a problem, jump right in there.\n\n340\n00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.380\nI'm with Wes on using select people,\nbecause that's always a better way to go.\n\n341\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.020\nAlmost buy and large across the board.\n\n342\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.570\nBecause then you've got a few people\nthat are gonna give you some feed back.\n\n343\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.100\nAnd you're not interrupting\nthe entirety of your business model.\n\n344\n00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.810\nSo, working with that,\n\n345\n00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.750\nif you do wanna be on that bleeding edge,\nI would say go that way.\n\n346\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.520\nAnd keep everyone else on standard.\n\n347\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.659\nOther than that Wes,\nwe're talking about availability,\n\n348\n00:18:20.659 --> 00:18:22.080\nthat's one of the big things, right?\n\n349\n00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.980\nBecause this is a cloud service,\nthey have our stuff,\n\n350\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.760\nwe need to be able to get at it.\n\n351\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.820\nBut sometimes, the worst does happen,\nor things are happening and\n\n352\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.340\nmaybe I wanna stay on\ntop of what's going on.\n\n353\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.340\nMost of these types of systems,\nthe IAS, PAS, and\n\n354\n00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.680\nSAS systems have some sort of\nmonitoring feature built it.\n\n355\n00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.380\nSo, if something does go wrong,\n\n356\n00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.190\nor if there's even just\ninformation that I need to know.\n\n357\n00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.970\nI can see that, see what's going on, and\nthen plan and act accordingly, right?\n\n358\n00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:49.670\nThat's right.\n\n359\n00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.100\nThey do have, they've got what's\ncalled Service Health setting.\n\n360\n00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.680\nAll Right?\nOr feature, if you will,\n\n361\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.660\ninside of Office 365.\n\n362\n00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.340\nSo this is no exception to the rule here,\nit has it as well.\n\n363\n00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.710\nSo if we check this out,\nwe can go down to Service Health.\n\n364\n00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.510\nAnd then, let me kinda zoom in on that so,\nyou guys can see that a little bit better,\n\n365\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.980\nthat's kinda difficult to see there.\n\n366\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.040\nSo, Service Health does exactly that.\n\n367\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.670\nYou can also see Planned Maintenance,\nmaintenance that obviously,\n\n368\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.800\nwe know that it's coming up so that your\ncompany and corporation can prepare for.\n\n369\n00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.079\nBut, when it comes to\nmonitoring Service Health.\n\n370\n00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.340\nAll right, here's our Service Health.\n\n371\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.800\nAnd what this lets me know is,\nit lets me, well, I'll tell you what,\n\n372\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.860\nlet's go ahead and also zoom in on\nsome of these icons down here, right?\n\n373\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.690\nSo, I could see the green\ncheck marks here and\n\n374\n00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.700\nI could see that the service is online and\nit's healthy.\n\n375\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.300\nNow, it's, not just for Office365,\njust saying hey, how's Office365?\n\n376\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.340\nWell we've got a lot of components, right?\n\n377\n00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.080\nA lot of different applications that are\nall bundled together inside of Office 365.\n\n378\n00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.980\nAnd your company might not\nuse every one of them.\n\n379\n00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.620\nAll right, so\nthis is also gonna be something that's\n\n380\n00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.550\nmodified accordingly based on\nwhatever your subscription is.\n\n381\n00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.770\nNow notice that, and I'll tell you what,\nlet me spend a little bit more\n\n382\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.160\ntime here so\nwe can look at some of these icons, right?\n\n383\n00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.610\nI can see there's a service interruption.\n\n384\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:05.840\nI can see additional information.\n\n385\n00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.800\nWe'll look at that too, by the way,\ncuz you can see the Power, what is it,\n\n386\n00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.930\nPower BI here has got some information\nthat we might wanna check out if\n\n387\n00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.890\nwe're monitoring Service Health.\n\n388\n00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:18.070\nYou could see Service degradation there,\nand Service restored.\n\n389\n00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.760\nSo, yeah they do make it fairly easy so\n\n390\n00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.080\nyou can see what the icons\nmean right away.\n\n391\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.030\nBut let's go a little\nbit farther than that.\n\n392\n00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:30.800\nNotice that if I zoom in here, we've got\nPower BI, their analytical software here.\n\n393\n00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.780\nAnd notice we've got some\nexclamation points here.\n\n394\n00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:34.490\nLet's see what that means.\n\n395\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.440\nIn fact I'm going to go back\nto January 2nd here and\n\n396\n00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.656\nsee what one of the first one is.\n\n397\n00:20:38.656 --> 00:20:39.480\nAnd all I gotta do,\n\n398\n00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.000\none of the great things about this is, all\nI gotta do is click on that little icon.\n\n399\n00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.680\nAnd when I click on the icon here it\ntells me that we do have some incidents\n\n400\n00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.410\nthat are going on.\n\n401\n00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.620\nNotice that we've got\nincident numbers here.\n\n402\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.875\nAll right, I don't know what PB\nstands for, maybe peanut butter.\n\n403\n00:20:55.875 --> 00:20:57.170\n[LAUGH] But I can look down.\n\n404\n00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.800\nAnd if I scroll all the way\ndown to when this started,\n\n405\n00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.030\nwe see that they are investigating, right?\n\n406\n00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.300\nThat's pretty bad.\n\n407\n00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.990\n>> It's pretty bad,\nthat's what [INAUDIBLE].\n\n408\n00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.750\nNumber 43752.\nYeah, there we go, there we go.\n\n409\n00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.880\nSo we could see they're telling us,\nthey're letting us know that, hey look.\n\n410\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.910\nThe engineers are investigating\nan issue it says that some users\n\n411\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:15.810\nmay be experiencing.\n\n412\n00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.550\nAnd then they give us a timeline, right?\n\n413\n00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.020\nSo remember,\nwhen we talked about availability,\n\n414\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.890\nwe talked about how many literally,\ndown to the seconds,\n\n415\n00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.660\nminutes per month,\nhours per year that this is available.\n\n416\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.250\nWell guess what?\n\n417\n00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.200\nTime is ticking here for Microsoft.\n\n418\n00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.690\nAnd according to their financially backed\nSLA, they've gotta be on the ball,\n\n419\n00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.730\nand they've gotta get this back up and\nrunning.\n\n420\n00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.260\nAnd you can see right here that we've\nhaving intermittent issues, and\n\n421\n00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.499\nthis is for a half hour.\n\n422\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.530\nThen it looks like it even,\n\n423\n00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.840\nthey're restoring the service\nfinally the next day.\n\n424\n00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.170\nAnd they're still restoring the service.\n\n425\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:52.030\nAnd then finally here, what was that,\nyesterday in fact, we're the 6th here.\n\n426\n00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.990\nIt looks like service\nwas completely restored.\n\n427\n00:21:53.990 --> 00:22:00.000\nSo, I get this high-level overview of\nwhat's going on with the service itself.\n\n428\n00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.690\nNow Dan you had mentioned earlier,\nlike in some of those other interfaces,\n\n429\n00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.130\nthat you can monitor the health\nof your virtual machines.\n\n430\n00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.050\nWell, that's a little bit different,\nright?\n\n431\n00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:13.700\nIf I'm monitoring virtual machines, that's\nmy configurations that maybe went wrong.\n\n432\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.990\nAnd it let's me know that I have\nto get there and get in there and\n\n433\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:22.830\nreconfigure something so that you\nknow the problem's remediated here.\n\n434\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.510\nDan how much of this do you\nthink I can configure here?\n\n435\n00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.640\nWell I'm looking, you've got a lot\nof stuff going on there, but\n\n436\n00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.370\nit really looks like this is all in\nMicrosoft's court to be honest with you.\n\n437\n00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.710\nIt is, and that goes right along with\nwhat we're talking about with software\n\n438\n00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.130\nas a service.\n\n439\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.345\nThat it's configuration on\nthe customer side, right?\n\n440\n00:22:40.345 --> 00:22:44.590\nThat troubleshooting,\nthe maintenance if you will, updates and\n\n441\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:48.480\npatches, outages, all the responsibility.\n\n442\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.055\nIn this case,\nMicrosoft being being the provider.\n\n443\n00:22:51.055 --> 00:22:55.475\nSo we can see that as well, and\nthat is a good thing to have.\n\n444\n00:22:55.475 --> 00:22:59.085\nNow, the other thing that\ngoes along with that,\n\n445\n00:22:59.085 --> 00:23:01.765\nmonitoring Service Health\nas planned maintenance.\n\n446\n00:23:01.765 --> 00:23:07.055\nAnd I'm almost willing to bet that you\nwon't see any planned maintenance here.\n\n447\n00:23:07.055 --> 00:23:09.690\nYeah, there's not any planned\nmaintenance right now.\n\n448\n00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.840\nBut if it does come up,\nit's gonna let you know, so\n\n449\n00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.730\nyou have time, that hey, there might\nbe a little bit of downtime here.\n\n450\n00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.550\nMaybe you're not gonna see a downtime,\nright?\n\n451\n00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.600\nBecause they've got recovery or\nthey got high availability.\n\n452\n00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.410\nMaybe they're gonna shut\none data center down,\n\n453\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.750\nmove people's data to another center.\n\n454\n00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.570\nSo you really shouldn't see it,\ntoo much of an interruption.\n\n455\n00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.580\nBut at least your company\nis going to be aware of it.\n\n456\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.560\nSo that is a good thing to have, too.\n\n457\n00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:38.160\nNow also going along with\nthat is the Message Center.\n\n458\n00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:45.150\nWe have the Message Center here, and the\nMessage Center, it's kinda interesting.\n\n459\n00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.550\nIt's not talking about\neverything that's going wrong.\n\n460\n00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.903\nThis is like the 5 o'clock news.\n\n461\n00:23:49.903 --> 00:23:55.405\nThis is informing you of, hey, well it\nsays right there, stay informed, right?\n\n462\n00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:59.042\nBut there are some times where\nit's actually something that's\n\n463\n00:23:59.042 --> 00:24:02.213\ngonna be released that tries to prevent or\nfix an issue.\n\n464\n00:24:02.213 --> 00:24:03.966\nWell, let's see which one this was.\n\n465\n00:24:03.966 --> 00:24:09.500\nEnsure your device has the latest upgrade\nto prevent issues with Office 365.\n\n466\n00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.640\nPlans for a change, too, so\nupdating Internet Explorer.\n\n467\n00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:18.210\nThis is kinda off topic here,\nbut IE, what is it, 9?\n\n468\n00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.129\n8, 9 and\n10 they're pulling support for it, so\n\n469\n00:24:20.129 --> 00:24:23.040\nthis is gonna be a pretty big thing\nthat people have to be aware of.\n\n470\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.710\nAnd that goes back, so even though\nyou can't control the updates and\n\n471\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.360\npush out the patches,\nit still could affect your company.\n\n472\n00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.790\nAnd you need to be aware of that here.\n\n473\n00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.820\nSo that's a good thing to have here.\n\n474\n00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:40.490\nSo monitoring service health,\nyou can look at the service health here.\n\n475\n00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:45.256\nYou can see when something is not online,\nor is at reduced functionality.\n\n476\n00:24:45.256 --> 00:24:47.880\nWith the service maintenance here too,\n\n477\n00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.730\nwe could go to the Message center,\nwe can find out, are they doing anything?\n\n478\n00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.660\nWe can even categorize this, if we want,\ndown to what is just prevent or fix.\n\n479\n00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.360\nOr I just want to be informed,\nI want to know what's going on.\n\n480\n00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.180\nSo, it's a good way that you\ncan really rifle in on any of\n\n481\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.320\nthe specific issues that you\nmight have a concern on,\n\n482\n00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.990\nthat might interrupt the service\nthat you're being provided.\n\n483\n00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.820\n>> Now, am I seeing that getting this\ninformation is like okay, great.\n\n484\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.300\nYou're having an outage, or you're having\na trouble, you're making a change to\n\n485\n00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.010\nsomething, so availability\nmight be a little bit sketchy.\n\n486\n00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.110\nAnd you're thinking, okay,\nthat's nice to know,\n\n487\n00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.015\nbut what do I do with that information?\n\n488\n00:25:24.015 --> 00:25:26.010\nWes, that's a really good question.\n\n489\n00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.140\nWhat do we do with that information?\n\n490\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.500\n>> Well,\nthe information allows you the ability to\n\n491\n00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.290\nmake not so much changes,\njust to make preparations, right?\n\n492\n00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:42.194\nIf you know that maybe you rely on\na specific service that could have, and\n\n493\n00:25:42.194 --> 00:25:46.990\nit shouldn't, according to the SOA,\nit shouldn't have a lot of downtime there.\n\n494\n00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.910\nBut just so that you're aware,\nyou don't want at 12:30 or\n\n495\n00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:55.040\nwhatever AM the night before\nyou come in on a Monday,\n\n496\n00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.210\nto realize that all of a sudden you've\ngot some major downtime on your\n\n497\n00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.310\nnetworks because of some kind of a bug.\n\n498\n00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.500\nOr, you know,\nservice issue that they're trying to fix.\n\n499\n00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.940\nNow one of the great things is, is they\ndo put this information out for you.\n\n500\n00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.270\nSo that if you wanna find out, hey,\n\n501\n00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:19.175\nare there things that we can expect in the\nfuture, right, so that I can plan for it.\n\n502\n00:26:19.175 --> 00:26:23.470\nWell, that's where they got\na concept called roadmapping, right?\n\n503\n00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.600\nFuture roadmapping.\n\n504\n00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.650\nYou wanna be aware of some of the things\nthat might be in development.\n\n505\n00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.500\nThey might be working on things\nthat they've pushed out.\n\n506\n00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.220\nWell that's where the Roadmap\nfrom Office 365 comes in.\n\n507\n00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.120\nAnd I've actually got that pulled up.\n\n508\n00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.070\nAnd I love how they label this,\nthe Customer Success Center.\n\n509\n00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.450\nGotta keep in mind that they want\nyou to be successful, right?\n\n510\n00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.580\nWhen you're successful, providers, well,\nthey continue to provide a service and\n\n511\n00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.080\nyou continue to pay them.\n\n512\n00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.170\nSo that's always a good thing.\n\n513\n00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:54.030\nAnd what's really good about this is you\ncan also narrow your search down here.\n\n514\n00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.230\nWe could see some of the updates\nthat are already released, right?\n\n515\n00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.420\nIf I wanted to, I could expand\nthis out and I could say, and\n\n516\n00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.090\nwe're not gonna go through this list,\nthere's a ton of them.\n\n517\n00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.690\nBut there's a lot of things\nthat they've already released.\n\n518\n00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.480\nWell, I can also see\nadditional features and\n\n519\n00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.060\nupdates that are going to\nbe rolled out here, right?\n\n520\n00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.680\nThey're in the process, you can see, maybe\nthey're not available to all customers.\n\n521\n00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.750\nKeep in mind, in the update process,\nwhether you pick standard release or\n\n522\n00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.540\nfirst release,\njust because somebody else has\n\n523\n00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.730\nbeen released that update doesn't mean\nit's actually affected your company yet.\n\n524\n00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:29.640\nAnd we can see that too.\n\n525\n00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.930\nSo we can see, and again,\nit's a laundry list here, for sure, right?\n\n526\n00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.970\nOf the things that are in\nthe middle of being launched and\n\n527\n00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.780\nrolled out to the end users.\n\n528\n00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.320\nAnother one that I like too is, you can\nsee things that are in development.\n\n529\n00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.820\nThere was one that was really,\nreally cool here,\n\n530\n00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.500\nlet me see if I can find it real quick.\n\n531\n00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.540\nEvents from email,\nadding that functionality.\n\n532\n00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.620\nThere was another one here.\n\n533\n00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.650\nGroups in Office 365 for Yammer.\n\n534\n00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:03.700\nSo this is probably some\ninformation that they've gathered,\n\n535\n00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.608\nstatistical information\nthat they've gathered.\n\n536\n00:28:05.608 --> 00:28:09.500\nAnd somebody is saying hey, we want\nthese features, we don't have them,\n\n537\n00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.060\nwe want them.\n\n538\n00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.920\nWell, that's the difference between\ncustomization and configuration.\n\n539\n00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.500\nRemember, you don't have\naccess to their code, so\n\n540\n00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.240\nwhat they're doing is they're\nprobably gathering data,\n\n541\n00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.860\nand they're taking surveys, and\nthey're finding well, these are some\n\n542\n00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.270\nof the features that we're gonna add\ncoming up in the future, so it's good.\n\n543\n00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.870\nAnd then as well as the ones that\nare no longer being developed.\n\n544\n00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.480\nApparently maybe they didn't work, and\n\n545\n00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.372\nthey threw them overboard on the trip\nthere, and we'll never see them again.\n\n546\n00:28:30.372 --> 00:28:35.280\nSo, roadmapping is also very good so\nthat you have a look to\n\n547\n00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.300\nthe future on what you can expect to see,\nversus what is happening right now.\n\n548\n00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.030\n>> Awesome, well Wes we've\ncovered a lot of ground today.\n\n549\n00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.580\nMaking sure that we understand\nwhere responsibility lies\n\n550\n00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.930\nwhen it comes to things like IAS,\nSAAS, and PAAS.\n\n551\n00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.790\nAnd also making sure that we\nunderstand how things get updated,\n\n552\n00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:57.060\nwhose responsibility that is, how we\nmake sure things stay available for us.\n\n553\n00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.210\nIt's always a good thing to make\nsure that our data is available.\n\n554\n00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:00.050\n>> Yes.\n>> I know I like\n\n555\n00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.350\nbeing able to get to my data.\n\n556\n00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.400\nWes, is there anything else that we\nneed to cover before we close the show?\n\n557\n00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:10.646\n>> I think I have mentioned this\nterm to you guys [LAUGH] a lot.\n\n558\n00:29:10.646 --> 00:29:12.990\nAnd I haven't defined the term, SLA.\n\n559\n00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.960\nI haven't really mentioned, I keep saying\nthat's our Service Level Agreement.\n\n560\n00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.910\nWhat does that mean?\n\n561\n00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:20.120\nAll right, well for us,\nyou need to know that that's the minimum\n\n562\n00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.680\nlevel of acceptable service that\nthe provider is going to give you.\n\n563\n00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:29.800\nAnd according to, like for instance their\nDRPs, their data responsibility policies,\n\n564\n00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:34.440\nthey have a certain level that you're\ngonna enter into, a contract, and\n\n565\n00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.420\nthat they need to provide it for you.\n\n566\n00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.510\nSo, I wanna just take a second here and\nshow you that.\n\n567\n00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.810\nYou can find that information\nout here as well on TechNet, and\n\n568\n00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.373\nyou can find their Service Level\nAgreements if you really need to.\n\n569\n00:29:45.373 --> 00:29:48.366\nJust understand for\nthe exam, what is an SLA?\n\n570\n00:29:48.366 --> 00:29:53.020\nYou don't really have to know,\nI need that Subsection 52B, Clause A.\n\n571\n00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.410\nYou don't have to be a lawyer.\n\n572\n00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:57.030\nJust know what\nthe Service Level Agreement means, right?\n\n573\n00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:01.250\nAnd remember when it comes to the high\navailability that it's 99.9%.\n\n574\n00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.920\nI'll get it right here eventually.\n\n575\n00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:09.750\nOne of the last things you need to know\nfor the exam is liability, all right?\n\n576\n00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.470\nMicrosoft, and here's their\nonline subscription agreement, so\n\n577\n00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.224\nit ties all in,\nis the capping of the liability, right?\n\n578\n00:30:18.224 --> 00:30:24.275\nThere are industry-wide standards\nout there that they set that says\n\n579\n00:30:24.275 --> 00:30:30.040\na cloud service provider is only\nliable to such and such amount, right?\n\n580\n00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.850\nTwelve months or\n$5,000 is essentially what it is,\n\n581\n00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.780\nper customer, and\nit's called liability capping.\n\n582\n00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:40.970\nSo, you can see that here,\nas well, and and\n\n583\n00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:45.720\nwe scroll down here, warranties,\nlimitations, liability, right here.\n\n584\n00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.950\nAnd they talk about during 12 months\nbefore the cause of action and\n\n585\n00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:50.690\ndamages up to $5,000.\n\n586\n00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.810\nAnd this isn't something like\nMicrosoft just come up with and\n\n587\n00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.300\nsaid oh, we'll put the limit right here.\n\n588\n00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.700\nThat's actually an industry-wide standard\n\n589\n00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.810\nthat most of the cloud providers\nwill have to follow, and come under.\n\n590\n00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.520\nSo a couple of things,\nmore of the legalities, SLAs,\n\n591\n00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.430\nservice level agreements.\n\n592\n00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.330\nJust know what it is.\n\n593\n00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:11.870\nIt means minimal level of acceptable\nperformance that Microsoft can give you,\n\n594\n00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.670\nand then know that the liability capping\nas well, cuz it could show up on the exam.\n\n595\n00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.500\n>> Yes, just know that they are monetarily\nbacking up the claim that they\n\n596\n00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.180\nwill make your data available.\n\n597\n00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.500\nWhich is a good thing.\n\n598\n00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.800\nWes, thank you so much for\njoining us today and walking us through\n\n599\n00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.375\nwhat we can expect when it comes to\nmaking sure our updates are done, and\n\n600\n00:31:28.375 --> 00:31:30.820\nthat availability is there for our data.\n\n601\n00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.110\nAnd you know what we've come\nto the end of our show.\n\n602\n00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.460\nSo thank you all for watching.\n\n603\n00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.750\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n604\n00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.340\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n605\n00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.665\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n606\n00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:43.149\n[MUSIC]\n\n607\n00:31:43.149 --> 00:31:46.340\n[SOUND]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.200\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\ntoday we are continuing on our cloud\n\n4\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.000\nfundamentals series Joining me in\nthe studio today to help us out with that\n\n5\n00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.540\nis none other than my good friend,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.391\nWelcome to the show, Wes.\n\n7\n00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:28.131\nHow are you doing today sir?\n\n8\n00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:29.441\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing okay.\nIt's great to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:30.770\nThanks for having me back, and\n\n10\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.821\nthat's right we're gonna be talking\nabout enabling cloud services today.\n\n11\n00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:36.780\nWe're gonna be taking\na look at Office 365,\n\n12\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.090\nand one of the things that we have to\ndo before we even start to sign up for\n\n13\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.070\nOffice 365 is we have to go through\na little bit of the planning.\n\n14\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.290\nWe have to figure out what\nare our network capacity and\n\n15\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.300\nsome of the dependencies\nthat are going to you know,\n\n16\n00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.460\nwe have to have this information in\nplace before we just dive right in and\n\n17\n00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.360\nsign up because one of the things you have\nbe very careful is when you sign up for\n\n18\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.960\nOffice 365, you name your company,\nas you see coming up in this episode,\n\n19\n00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.990\nit really can't change certain aspects\n\n20\n00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.150\nof the Office 365 infrastructure\nafter you've set it in place.\n\n21\n00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.640\nThat's one of the reasons it's really\ngood to have this information ready\n\n22\n00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.050\nbefore we start off.\n\n23\n00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.520\nSo one of the first things that we\nhave to look at is your domains.\n\n24\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.990\nYou have to pay attention to how\nbig is your domain gonna be.\n\n25\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.450\nHow any users are you gonna have?\n\n26\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.630\nAnd where's the location\nof your company gonna be?\n\n27\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.660\nAre you gonna be a multi-site,\nare you gonna be an international company?\n\n28\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.080\nSo it's gonna be important.\n\n29\n00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.960\nimportant.\n\n30\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.680\nThe next thing we really have to look\nat are, for instance, firewalls.\n\n31\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.490\nRight?\nWhen you're going to be communicating out\n\n32\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.970\nthere with the internet,\nobviously you're going to want\n\n33\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.100\nto secure your infrastructure\non your internal network, so\n\n34\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.290\nit is gonna be important to understand\nhow you could communicate outbound and\n\n35\n00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.530\ninbound so that you don't have\nthings like, for instance,\n\n36\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.160\nservice interruptions when you go to\nlaunch your Office 365 deployment.\n\n37\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.820\nSo I've got the website pulled up\nright here, and one of the things that\n\n38\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.660\nwe really have to make sure is that\nwe have communication inbound and\n\n39\n00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.390\noutbound when you're planning\nyour Office 365 deployment here.\n\n40\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.690\nNow you can see right here\nit talks about some URLs and\n\n41\n00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.860\nsome IP address ranges that\nyou're gonna need to be aware of,\n\n42\n00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.330\nif you're gonna go ahead and\nset up your firewall rules.\n\n43\n00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.440\nSo Dan, here,\nI don't know if you can see this, but\n\n44\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.960\nwe've got a few URLs in the pipeline\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n45\n00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.700\nWe've got a few ports, and you can see\nthat this is an amazing list, right?\n\n46\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.060\nYou might not wanna do this too much.\n\n47\n00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.370\nRemember we're talking about\nsoftware as a service, but\n\n48\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.050\nit looks like you're doing all\nthe servicing with all this information.\n\n49\n00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.560\nNow what does this mean for us?\n\n50\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.000\nYeah, I could take,\ncertainly start my own list here and\n\n51\n00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.980\ntyping out all these URLs and\nall these port numbers, but\n\n52\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.540\none of the things I want you to pay\nattention to here is the fact that\n\n53\n00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.890\nthe majority of this is going over\nHTTP traffic and HTTPS traffic.\n\n54\n00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.490\nWell, why is that?\n\n55\n00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.510\nWell, it's software as a service,\nwe're connecting through a web browser.\n\n56\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.730\nSo the two major port values are 80 and\n443.\n\n57\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.170\nNow, what is this mean for us if we\nare not in a heavily managed environment?\n\n58\n00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.000\nAbsolutely nothing, and\nthat's one of the great things.\n\n59\n00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.800\nYou don't really need all\nof this information if\n\n60\n00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.380\nyou are going to just allow your computers\nto connect to the internet, right?\n\n61\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.950\nAt a certain point, right,\nif it's software as a service, and\n\n62\n00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.620\nyou're doing all of the servicing here,\nwell, what are they doing on their end?\n\n63\n00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.830\nSo, these values, understand that\nwhen you're planning your domains,\n\n64\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.910\nwhen you're planning your communication,\nreally boil down to,\n\n65\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.190\ndo you allow your computers to\nconnect outbound to the internet?\n\n66\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.950\nSo, for a heavily managed environment,\nif you've got some kind of security policy\n\n67\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.040\nthat says that everything has\nto go through the proxy, well,\n\n68\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.780\nthe proxy's gonna have to be configured so\nit recognizes this traffic.\n\n69\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.210\nFor us,\nwe don't really have to worry about it\n\n70\n00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.350\nif we don't need that\nheavily secured environment.\n\n71\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.040\nSo the good thing is, we really don't\nneed that information which is really,\n\n72\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.560\nreally good.\n\n73\n00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is really good cuz\nthat's a lot of information.\n\n74\n00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.850\nBut Wes, you did say that this\nis all TLS SSL encrypted traffic\n\n75\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.890\nmaking that connection.\n\n76\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.030\nSo even as an administrator\nwe would probably be okay\n\n77\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.260\nto just allow those connections and\neven bypass the proxy at that point.\n\n78\n00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.980\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, that would\nprobably be for some kind of strict\n\n79\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.600\ninside corporate policy, where for\nwhatever reason the company itself\n\n80\n00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.790\nhas some strict policy about\ncommunicating outbound with the internet.\n\n81\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.620\nBut that's right.\n\n82\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.030\n443 port 443.\nWe're using SSL and TLS communication,\n\n83\n00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.790\nencrypted communications, between our\nweb browsers and their data centers.\n\n84\n00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.640\nNow, speaking of that communication, some\nof the things we also have to worry about\n\n85\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.370\nare what are the bandwidth requirements\ninside for the communications.\n\n86\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.900\nThey also have some information here\non how you can fine tune Office 365 if\n\n87\n00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.620\nyou need performance levels\nto be where they need to be.\n\n88\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.360\nSo you can come in here, and one of\nthe things they do is they go through\n\n89\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.390\ngiving you some ideas on\nplanning your network capacity.\n\n90\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.280\nSee, if we're in a small environment,\nevery environment's gonna have to have,\n\n91\n00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.940\nis gonna have a certain amount of\nbandwidth that they're allocated by.\n\n92\n00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.300\nWhatever their internet service provider\nis you know, maybe even a data cap for\n\n93\n00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.810\nthat matter.\n\n94\n00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.800\nBut larger companies will definitely have\nto worry about this because you know\n\n95\n00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.620\nwhen we talk about a smaller company 300\nusers, depending on how your networks\n\n96\n00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.820\ninfrastructure is set up, you might not\nbe worried about this too much, right?\n\n97\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.770\nYou might have the performance on your\nnetwork that everything runs fine.\n\n98\n00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.680\nHowever when you start\nscaling up past 300 users.\n\n99\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.370\nYou get into that 3,000 users.\n\n100\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.820\nYou get beyond 3,000 users.\n\n101\n00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.220\nThen we start to, the entire company\nis geographically dispersed.\n\n102\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.270\nWell now we are not only worried\nabout an internal communication\n\n103\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.760\noutbound to the internet\nfrom one location.\n\n104\n00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.410\nNow we're worried about\nthings like WAN links right?\n\n105\n00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.350\nSo they also give you things to\ntell you about WAN accelerators to\n\n106\n00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.130\nensure that you have good communication,\nroute redundancy, making sure that if\n\n107\n00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.458\nyou are using multiple ISPs, if one\ngoes down you still have connectivity.\n\n108\n00:06:11.458 --> 00:06:17.320\nOne of the recommendations is\nthey say to monitor your network\n\n109\n00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.480\ncapacity and when you do this, if you see\nthat your company is currently using 75%\n\n110\n00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.240\nof your bandwidth capacity\nprior to going to Office 365,\n\n111\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.370\nthen there's a good chance\nyou're gonna have to upgrade.\n\n112\n00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.290\nYou're gonna have to scale out\nyour internal infrastructure to\n\n113\n00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.840\nmake sure that you don't get a diminished\nexperience when you're connecting from\n\n114\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.910\nyour local network out to\nMicrosoft data centers.\n\n115\n00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.790\nAnd that's something\nthat's very important.\n\n116\n00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can imagine this\nbeing quite bandwidth intensive,\n\n117\n00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.040\nto be honest with you.\n\n118\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.980\nYou've gotta think,\nemails going through this.\n\n119\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.130\nYou might have exchange information\ngoing through this system.\n\n120\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.980\nThat's a lot of data.\n\n121\n00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.900\nAnd then it's all encrypted\nthrough TLS and SSL.\n\n122\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.330\nSo that's adding overhead\nto the sending of the data.\n\n123\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.350\nYou're probably gonna need a pretty\ngood connection out to the internet.\n\n124\n00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good point too.\n\n125\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.830\nI didn't even mention that.\n\n126\n00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.350\nWhen you have things like encrypted\ncommunications we're talking about TCP\n\n127\n00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.760\ncommunications and that puts a lot\nof work on your network devices so\n\n128\n00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.120\nyou might even have to use things like\nload balancers because it's all over TCP.\n\n129\n00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.620\nAnd if you are not\nfamiliar with that right,\n\n130\n00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.240\nwe've got the breaking down of packets.\n\n131\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.970\nWe got the sequencing and numbering and\nall that information, all that logic that\n\n132\n00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.460\nhas to go through every packet that\nis sent between you and Microsoft.\n\n133\n00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.750\nSo, again you might have to go\nwith things like WAN accelerators,\n\n134\n00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.280\nyou might have to scale up your\ninternal network infrastructures and\n\n135\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.690\neven go with load balancers so\nthat if one network device can't\n\n136\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.280\nperform adequately in a very large\nnetwork, then you have more than one.\n\n137\n00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.940\nNow one of the things that we also\nhave to keep in mind is, well,\n\n138\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.350\nwhat are the client requirements, right?\n\n139\n00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.520\nWe've talked about some of\nthe network requirements.\n\n140\n00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.650\nWell, what about the client themselves?\n\n141\n00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.791\nWhat are they required to have?\n\n142\n00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:56.532\nWell, the good thing is, Microsoft also\nhas plenty of information out there on\n\n143\n00:07:56.532 --> 00:08:00.352\nwhat you need to do as an admin to\nprepare your client stations and\n\n144\n00:08:00.352 --> 00:08:02.716\nwhat those minimum requirements are.\n\n145\n00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:06.802\nSo I've actually got that pulled up here\nfor us and There are all kinds of plans.\n\n146\n00:08:06.802 --> 00:08:09.705\nWe're gonna get into some of\nthe subscription plans coming up.\n\n147\n00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:15.370\nBut I'm gonna just look at the business\neducation and government plans here.\n\n148\n00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.520\nActually, let's see here.\n\n149\n00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.385\nYeah, we'll do that.\n\n150\n00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:22.260\nWe'll just go ahead and\nlook at the business plans.\n\n151\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.090\nNow one of the great things is for\n\n152\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.400\nthe most part,\nthese requirements are really the same.\n\n153\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.400\nThe one thing that you have to consider\nis whether you're going to be using\n\n154\n00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.900\nonline web applications and\nonly Office online,\n\n155\n00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.370\nbecause if that's the case, you're not\nreally processing data locally, right?\n\n156\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.640\nYour web browser's connecting to their\nplatform like we've discussed in prior\n\n157\n00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.190\nepisodes.\n\n158\n00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.060\nAnd it's their machines that\nare using the computational power\n\n159\n00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.980\nto get whatever the job is done, whatever\nproductivity app that you're using.\n\n160\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.520\nHowever, if you're gonna do a full\ninstallation which some of the plans allow\n\n161\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.690\nyou, and you're gonna download Office,\nthe entire full Office Suite,\n\n162\n00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.620\nto your computer, well then now you\nhave a stand alone installation really.\n\n163\n00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.330\nYou could take your computer, you can\ndisconnect it from the internet, and\n\n164\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.270\nyou could work locally\nwith those applications.\n\n165\n00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.620\nSo now you do have to worry\nabout the clients themselves and\n\n166\n00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.830\nmake sure that the clients have\nthe horsepower that they need and\n\n167\n00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.930\nhave the RAM that they need\nin order to perform well.\n\n168\n00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.700\nNow you can see right here, I've got\nsome of this information pulled up.\n\n169\n00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.180\nAnd the first thing they talk about\nis the computer and processor.\n\n170\n00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.620\nAnd one of the things I like is they,\nit's not just PC.\n\n171\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.970\nThis also works on Mac as well.\n\n172\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.040\nYou can see that they talk\nabout a gigahertz processor.\n\n173\n00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.370\nDan, I think most of the processors\ntoday are probably a gigahertz.\n\n174\n00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.220\nHeck, we probably got more than\nthat on our phones, you know,\n\n175\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.110\nlet alone anything else.\n\n176\n00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.200\nThey do mention whether is gonna be x86,\nx64.\n\n177\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.270\nIf you're not familiar with those terms,\n\n178\n00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:58.630\nkeep in mind you have to make up your\nmind if you're going to do a download,\n\n179\n00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.300\na full installation, of the Office Suite\nto any of your local clients.\n\n180\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.380\nYou have to figure out are they\nrunning 32 bit operating systems?\n\n181\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.280\nCuz remember in a 32 bit operating system\nyou're limited to four gigs of RAM.\n\n182\n00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.300\nYou can't address more RAM than that.\n\n183\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.280\nBut that's not the minimum requirement.\n\n184\n00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.540\nSo even if you had just a little bit less,\nyou're okay.\n\n185\n00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.220\nBut it's very important when you're\nconsidering that for troubleshooting later\n\n186\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:27.520\non as well when it comes into whether it's\n32 bit or x64 is just 64 bit processor.\n\n187\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.818\nNow they do mention some other terms here.\n\n188\n00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:38.280\nAnd this SSE2 instruction set guys,\n\n189\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.500\nthat's just technical jargon for\nthe fact that these are, or\n\n190\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:49.010\nis an Intel technology that replaced\nthe earlier MMX, if I can get that right.\n\n191\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.545\nMMX instruction set inside\nof earlier Intel processors,\n\n192\n00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:55.300\nwhich are multimedia extensions,\nthat's all that means.\n\n193\n00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:00.281\nSo you have to make sure your processor\nhere supports this instruction set.\n\n194\n00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:01.876\nNow you might be saying,\n\n195\n00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:05.650\n\"Well, how do I know if my processor\nsupports these instruction sets?\".\n\n196\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.960\nWhen we talk about that, what we're\ntalking about is Pentium 4 processors and\n\n197\n00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.290\non supported.\n\n198\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.560\nSo if you've got a Pentium\n3 it's time to upgrade.\n\n199\n00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.595\nLive in the now.\n\n200\n00:11:15.595 --> 00:11:18.890\n[LAUGH] You need to get a newer\ncomputer so it's not gonna work.\n\n201\n00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.400\nBut if you've got something like a Pentium\n4 class and beyond you should be okay.\n\n202\n00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.090\nNow when it comes to the Mac side of this,\n\n203\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.930\nwe have to just make sure\nthat it's an Intel processor.\n\n204\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.160\nAnd again, that technology\nright there is Intel based so\n\n205\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.080\nif you've got an Intel processor,\nyou should be okay.\n\n206\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.995\nSome of the other standards that\nwe need to worry about too or\n\n207\n00:11:40.995 --> 00:11:43.920\npre-req's there is the memory.\n\n208\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.280\nTwo gigs of ram.\n\n209\n00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.110\nMost of your systems today\ntypically have two gigs of RAM.\n\n210\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.290\nEven your 32 bit systems a lot\nof times come stacked with four.\n\n211\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.560\nIf you've got some older machines,\nkeep in mind that\n\n212\n00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.460\nmaybe your company does have a series of\nmachines that are a little bit older, or\n\n213\n00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.040\nmaybe you even have some laptops.\n\n214\n00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.440\nMaybe you've got people that\nare traveling around the country, and\n\n215\n00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.970\nthat's the benefit of\nthe software as a service.\n\n216\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.730\nI can connect to the internet anywhere\nI've got an internet connection,\n\n217\n00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.170\nI should say, and\nthen I can connect to Office 365.\n\n218\n00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.660\nNow, what's kind of interesting\nis the hard drive space.\n\n219\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.790\nIt's actually double on\nMac than it is on PC.\n\n220\n00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.160\nAnd you got 3GB of available disk space.\n\n221\n00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.260\nProbably gonna have that.\n\n222\n00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.710\nMost of your, even your average\ndrives today have 250 and\n\n223\n00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.760\nbeyond 256 GB and beyond.\n\n224\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.370\nSo, that really shouldn't be a problem.\n\n225\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.050\nLike I said, if you're running some legacy\nhardware out there, which can happen.\n\n226\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:45.040\nCompanies don't just always have money to\njust invest in the brand new, latest and\n\n227\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.670\ngreatest stuff, keep that in mind too,\ncuz it could come into play.\n\n228\n00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.737\nNext thing we have is well,\nthe Mac Requirements.\n\n229\n00:12:56.737 --> 00:12:59.570\n6 GB of hard drive space here.\n\n230\n00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.290\nThey do mention that you have to\nhave what is it, the Mac OS extended\n\n231\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:09.160\nhard drive format or hierarchical\nfile system plus hard disk format.\n\n232\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.450\nSo you do need to make sure\nthat your drives are prepared.\n\n233\n00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.920\nNow on Mac, typically today your hard\ndrives are going to be the OS extended, so\n\n234\n00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.780\nyou really don't have to worry about that.\n\n235\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.120\nBut they do point that out and\nmake sure that you have that likewise.\n\n236\n00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.810\nAll right, one of the next things\nthat we gotta look at is the display,\n\n237\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.460\ndisplay information.\n\n238\n00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.900\nYou can see that PC and\nMac are both the same,\n\n239\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:37.410\n1280 by 800 screen resolution and then\nthe graphics driver here is interesting.\n\n240\n00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.555\nIt's DirectX 10.\n\n241\n00:13:38.555 --> 00:13:43.005\nIf you guys aren't familiar with\nDirectX 10 and why we would need that,\n\n242\n00:13:43.005 --> 00:13:46.105\nthat's basically the graphic subsystem for\nPC.\n\n243\n00:13:46.105 --> 00:13:48.695\nIt's where we get the term Xbox from,\nright?\n\n244\n00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:51.165\nIt's all of the graphics\ntechnology inside a PC.\n\n245\n00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:55.585\nNow, Hugh, what's interesting again,\nI'd noticed,\n\n246\n00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.745\nand I think this is\na typo on their website.\n\n247\n00:13:58.745 --> 00:14:02.850\nCan you tell me have you ever\nseen a Window server a 10 Server?\n\n248\n00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.090\n&gt;&gt; That's a negative on that.\n\n249\n00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Last time\n\n250\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.130\nI checked they don't create that part.\n\n251\n00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.480\n&gt;&gt; No, they don't create that.\n\n252\n00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.610\nIn fact,\nI actually did a Google search because I'm\n\n253\n00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.410\nfairly familiar with the server operating\nsystems, at least that they have out.\n\n254\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.970\nNot that I work with every one of them.\n\n255\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:23.030\nAnd, when I typed into the search engine,\nWindows 10 server, it came up with\n\n256\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.820\nthe trial edition of 2016 server,\nthat hasn't even been released yet.\n\n257\n00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.240\nSo, apparently,\nmaybe they're ahead of the game.\n\n258\n00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:29.740\nI'm not sure.\n\n259\n00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.250\nBut, that's definitely\na typo on their part.\n\n260\n00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.030\nI'm not so\nworried about the server side of this.\n\n261\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.400\nAnd, on the NTA exam,\n\n262\n00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.890\nthe cloud fundamentals exam,\nI wouldn't be worried about\n\n263\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.100\nthe whole server side of this because what\nthey really call out of the client side.\n\n264\n00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.150\nAnd when you think about it Dan,\n\n265\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.050\nwhen's the last time you made\na PowerPoint up on your server?\n\n266\n00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:49.990\n&gt;&gt; Zero times.\n\n267\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.620\nI couldn't tell you.\n\n268\n00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.295\nForever ago.\n\n269\n00:14:52.295 --> 00:14:53.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n270\n00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.580\nWe typically don't.\n\n271\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.330\nYou don't do that kind of\nstuff on your servers.\n\n272\n00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.870\nYour servers, you reduce the footprint.\n\n273\n00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.660\nYou don't work with them, so\neasiest way to remember this on the exam\n\n274\n00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.540\nWindows seven service pack one and\nabove for the client operating systems.\n\n275\n00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.430\nMake it easier on yourselves.\n\n276\n00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.220\nI love when you can memorize one thing and\n\n277\n00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.290\nyou don't have to memorize three or\nfour different operating systems.\n\n278\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.560\nStart with the first one and\n\n279\n00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.360\nif you can remember everything\nelse after that counts too.\n\n280\n00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.310\nMake it a lot easier on\nyourself with the exam.\n\n281\n00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.070\nEspecially when we hit you with\na ton of alphabet soup and\n\n282\n00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.400\na whole bunch of acronyms here.\n\n283\n00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.380\nNow the browser is interesting.\n\n284\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.110\nOkay, so since this is softwares and\nservices it's probably one of the most\n\n285\n00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.970\nimportant things when\nit comes to support for\n\n286\n00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:40.810\nOffice 365 because this is the direct\nconnection mechanism, right?\n\n287\n00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:47.200\nThis is our life line between our local\nnetwork and Microsoft's Office 365.\n\n288\n00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.535\nSo you can get some more information here.\n\n289\n00:15:50.535 --> 00:15:53.482\nI can really just sum up all\nthis information for you.\n\n290\n00:15:53.482 --> 00:15:56.455\nIf you wanna look at it,\nby all means, check it out.\n\n291\n00:15:56.455 --> 00:16:00.947\nThey say that in Windows Or\nexcuse me Internet Explorer 8 and\n\n292\n00:16:00.947 --> 00:16:03.073\n9 diminished experience.\n\n293\n00:16:03.073 --> 00:16:07.362\nIn fact like Yammer they say completely\nunstable or no not even unstable,\n\n294\n00:16:07.362 --> 00:16:08.350\nunusable.\n\n295\n00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.570\nSo in some of the older\nbrowsers it's made to work\n\n296\n00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.580\nwith at least Internet Explorer 10.\n\n297\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.520\nAnd I would recommend if you're\ngonna use IE to Connect,\n\n298\n00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.770\nyou use Internet Explorer 11.\n\n299\n00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.190\nAnd they're going to tell you that.\n\n300\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.310\nThey're going to say use\nthe latest browsers.\n\n301\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.752\nNow one of the great things,\ntoo is it's not just Internet Explorer.\n\n302\n00:16:24.752 --> 00:16:27.390\nI know we're in a Microsoft\ntraining course here,\n\n303\n00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.740\nso of course we want to let you\nknow about Internet Explorer.\n\n304\n00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.670\nBut a lot of the other\nbrowsers are fully supported.\n\n305\n00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:38.300\nIn fact, they'll let you know here If you\ngo into the get more details then hey,\n\n306\n00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.170\nFirefox is fully supported.\n\n307\n00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.750\nChrome is fully supported and\nSafari is fully supported.\n\n308\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.610\nAnd they don't really have a lot of\nlimitations like they do in some of\n\n309\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.650\nthe earlier Internet Explorer versions so\nmake sure that you have that.\n\n310\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.180\n&gt;&gt; I see they've covered\nthe edge browser as well.\n\n311\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.650\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n312\n00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.450\nNow I'm glad you mentioned that too,\nbecause the Edge browser, being new, and\n\n313\n00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.888\nbeing the latest and greatest,\nis still not fully supported.\n\n314\n00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:06.388\n[LAUGH] And so, if you feel into-\n&gt;&gt; Supported, but not supported, right?\n\n315\n00:17:06.388 --> 00:17:09.032\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nit's kinda like being supported, only not.\n\n316\n00:17:09.032 --> 00:17:10.800\n[LAUGH] So you do have to watch that.\n\n317\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.470\nThere are some of the, some of the general\nlimitations to the newest browser here\n\n318\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.080\nin Windows 10 and beyond.\n\n319\n00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.970\nPay attention, again based on the plan and\nthe technologies you need\n\n320\n00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.410\nto use will really dictate which web\nbrowser that you should be using.\n\n321\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.775\nI will tell you that because\nInternet Explorer is built in,\n\n322\n00:17:27.775 --> 00:17:29.158\nuse Internet Explorer if you can.\n\n323\n00:17:29.158 --> 00:17:32.140\nIf you're like me, I also use,\nlike to use Chrome.\n\n324\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.150\nChrome's another good one.\n\n325\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:37.280\nI'm actually using Chrome a lot to connect\nto Office 365, and for the most part,\n\n326\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.700\nI really haven't had any problems.\n\n327\n00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.560\nNow you do have some .NET framework,\nright?\n\n328\n00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.320\nThe framework that Windows applications\nare built in that has to be here.\n\n329\n00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.670\nIt has to be supported.\n\n330\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.240\nIt has to be installed, excuse me.\n\n331\n00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.070\nThis is only in PC.\n\n332\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.330\nIt's not something you have\nto worry about on Mac.\n\n333\n00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.760\nBecause again, it's a framework for\nWindows application programming.\n\n334\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.100\nAnd do pay attention that 3.5 is required.\n\n335\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.300\nIf you have a more\nmodern operating system.\n\n336\n00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.240\nIf you have Windows 8.1,\n\n337\n00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.570\nif you have Windows 10 These are actually\nfeatures that you can turn on\n\n338\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.790\ninside of Windows that come bundled in\nby default, but they're not enabled.\n\n339\n00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.050\nSo you can always go out\nto the internet there and\n\n340\n00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.290\nyou can find out how to enable .NET 3.5.\n\n341\n00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:30.660\nI believe Windows 10 comes with .NET\n4.0 and may be 4.5, so you can see.\n\n342\n00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.980\nAnd then they got 4.6 CLR in there, too.\n\n343\n00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.250\nOther, you need an Internet connection,\nimagine that.\n\n344\n00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.070\nWe have software's a service, and\nwe need an Internet connection.\n\n345\n00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.356\n&gt;&gt; I thought we used witchcraft.\n\n346\n00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:45.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, [LAUGH] that's right.\n\n347\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.900\nSmoke signals.\n\n348\n00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.980\nThe client applications,\nwell, just pay attention.\n\n349\n00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.850\nLike I said, whatever's for your company,\n\n350\n00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.840\nwhatever you're gonna use,\nwe're not really gonna get into this.\n\n351\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.540\nYou can see it's a bunch of\nindividual information, and\n\n352\n00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.830\nit's really based on what\napplications you're gonna be running.\n\n353\n00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.140\nSo there are some considerations,\n\n354\n00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.450\nwe do have things that we have to\nconsider when it comes down to it.\n\n355\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:12.430\nRemember, you plan your networking,\nyour network, excuse me,\n\n356\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:17.640\nmaking sure that your network capacity can\nmeet the requirements for the Office 365.\n\n357\n00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.390\nIf you are in a heavily\nmanaged environment,\n\n358\n00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.300\nyou've got your work cut out for\nyou because you've got a lot of URLs and\n\n359\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.945\nI IP addresses, and maybe any firewall\nrules you have to set in place.\n\n360\n00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:32.112\nLike Dan mentioned earlier, if you're\nnot in a heavily managed environment,\n\n361\n00:19:32.112 --> 00:19:33.492\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n362\n00:19:33.492 --> 00:19:38.810\nIt's port 80, port 443 and\nyou should be able to connect just fine.\n\n363\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.640\nBandwidth implications, keep in mind.\n\n364\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.180\nThings like monitoring your bandwidth,\nif you're at 75% of your bandwidth\n\n365\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.500\ncapacity when you're monitoring it you\nhave to scale up a little bit more.\n\n366\n00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:55.690\nYou can use things like WAN accelerators\nand even hardware and software based,\n\n367\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.700\nload balancers too will make that work for\nyou.\n\n368\n00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.270\nAnd hopefully get a better experience\nout of your Office experience.\n\n369\n00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:10.845\nOne of the last things I would say that\nwe have to worry about is well DNS.\n\n370\n00:20:10.845 --> 00:20:12.345\nWe have to have some name resolutions.\n\n371\n00:20:12.345 --> 00:20:16.365\nSo DNS is a required bit for\njust about any communication that goes on.\n\n372\n00:20:16.365 --> 00:20:19.365\nThey do call it out on the objectives.\n\n373\n00:20:19.365 --> 00:20:22.695\nIt shouldn't really be\nsomething that surprises us\n\n374\n00:20:22.695 --> 00:20:27.325\nif you're not aware of DNS we've got MTA,\nfundamentals.\n\n375\n00:20:27.325 --> 00:20:30.340\nNetwork fundamentals courses\ntoo that you can kinda figure\n\n376\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.840\nout the domain name system.\n\n377\n00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.370\nRemember, when I send\na request to go to Office 365,\n\n378\n00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.160\nI need to be able to resolve\nthat to an IP address.\n\n379\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.850\nIf I don't have that, well,\nunfortunately I won't be able to connect.\n\n380\n00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's gonna be a little bit difficult.\n\n381\n00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.580\nWe said to use Human Readable Format.\n\n382\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.180\nI know it makes my life a whole lot easier\nto be able to type in office365.com or\n\n383\n00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.360\nwhatever the URL is, I can't remember\nit off the top of my head, but\n\n384\n00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.140\nusing that human readable format,\nother than the IP address,\n\n385\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.780\nwhich we saw that list of IP addresses\nThat goes along with Office 365.\n\n386\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.170\nIt's quite extensive, so it might be a\nlittle bit of a bear to try to do it that\n\n387\n00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.170\nway, so I'm glad DNS is around.\n\n388\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.960\nAnd it's not too bad to configure, or you\ncan also let Office do it itself, right?\n\n389\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we'll show you when\nyou're setting up your tenant.\n\n390\n00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.740\nAs far as the client side,\nthis is just what we'd say,\n\n391\n00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.100\nlike Dan's talking about,\nthis is normal DNS name resolution,\n\n392\n00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.550\nwhich means your local network adapter\nhas to have a DNS server, right.\n\n393\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.900\nAnd like I said, that shouldn't surprise\nyou, because every network communication,\n\n394\n00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.560\nthat's part of the TCP IP protocol stack.\n\n395\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.890\nYou don't have a DNS server\nsigned to the network adapter,\n\n396\n00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.620\nyou're not gonna communicate with the\nInternet unless you know every single IP\n\n397\n00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.680\naddress to every web server out\nthere that you ever wanna visit.\n\n398\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.490\nAnd that is not the least\nadministrative effort,\n\n399\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.700\nlike Microsoft likes to\ncall out on many occasions.\n\n400\n00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.940\nNow when we get to\nthe platform side of DNS,\n\n401\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.130\nthere will be some setup that\nwe have to do there too.\n\n402\n00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.860\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n403\n00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.825\nWell Wes, anything else we need\nto know about setting up or\n\n404\n00:21:52.825 --> 00:21:55.940\npre-planning when it comes\nto implementing Office 365?\n\n405\n00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.630\n&gt;&gt; Boy, we've got a bunch,\nthat's for sure.\n\n406\n00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:02.560\nYou've gotta know some of\nthe plans behind Office 365, and\n\n407\n00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.840\nyou really have to understand\nthe benefits over one versus the other.\n\n408\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.120\nAnd keep in mind things like scalability.\n\n409\n00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.610\nNow, I've actually got this pulled up,\n\n410\n00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.450\nsome of the different\nplans that they have here.\n\n411\n00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.324\nAnd I wanna just be,\nas a word of caution right away, and\n\n412\n00:22:17.324 --> 00:22:22.106\nyou're gonna see coming up in this\nepisode that we're gonna set up or\n\n413\n00:22:22.106 --> 00:22:27.713\ntenant right we're gonna create and\nconnect to Office 365 setting this up and\n\n414\n00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:32.166\nyou have to make sure that you\nchoose your plan wisely because one\n\n415\n00:22:32.166 --> 00:22:36.468\nof the things that they cannot\ndo after you set up your tenant.\n\n416\n00:22:36.468 --> 00:22:40.140\nNow define tenant,\nyour company name, right.\n\n417\n00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.030\nWhat are people gonna see you as\nwhen you send things like emails.\n\n418\n00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.890\nWhat is your domain's name going to be\nthat you connect to when you connect to\n\n419\n00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:47.440\nOffice 365.\n\n420\n00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.200\nIt can't be changed after the fact, so\ndo your research and do your homework and\n\n421\n00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.690\nhopefully we can brush a little of the\nmysticism here off of some of these plans,\n\n422\n00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.240\nand you can see what's going on here.\n\n423\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.190\nNow one of the first things I will say\nis that we're gonna look at some of\n\n424\n00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.420\nthe business plans, and\nthere's many different ones.\n\n425\n00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:09.270\nIn fact, yeah, I don't see it on the site,\nso I'll go ahead and\n\n426\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:14.220\nlet you guys know, there's quite\na few classes of plans, right?\n\n427\n00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.469\nHere, what we're gonna look at is more\nwhat I would believe that they're gonna be\n\n428\n00:23:17.469 --> 00:23:20.407\nlooking at for on the MTA are the business\nclass and the enterprise class.\n\n429\n00:23:20.407 --> 00:23:21.427\nBut there are more.\n\n430\n00:23:21.427 --> 00:23:26.089\nThere's a government plan,\nthere's educational plan,\n\n431\n00:23:26.089 --> 00:23:31.040\nthere's non-profit plans too,\nas well as even a kiosk plan.\n\n432\n00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.470\nSo if you're a company that\njust needs maybe just a few\n\n433\n00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:39.320\nonline applications you can do that\nif you just have company kiosks, or\n\n434\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.750\nthings like thin client, so\nit's a good thing to have.\n\n435\n00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.690\nThe other thing too is on the business\nplans you'll see here that there is,\n\n436\n00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.640\nthere are, excuse me.\n\n437\n00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.570\nTwo different types of\ncommitments that you can make.\n\n438\n00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.869\nThere is a yearly commitment and a monthly\nor an annually and a monthly subscription,\n\n439\n00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:59.590\nand you can see here that there's\na little bit of a price difference here.\n\n440\n00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:03.968\nSo if you say, hey I'm gonna commit to an\nannual contract, and you go right into it\n\n441\n00:24:03.968 --> 00:24:07.915\nas a annual contract You're gonna get\na slightly reduced price per user.\n\n442\n00:24:07.915 --> 00:24:12.017\nIf you're doing this on a month\nby month basis now, well,\n\n443\n00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:15.040\nyou'll have to pay a little bit more.\n\n444\n00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.330\nAnd one of the benefits I\ncan see from that really,\n\n445\n00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.130\nis well,\nit maybe you're just gonna test this.\n\n446\n00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:24.160\nMaybe you don't know if you're truly\ngonna go to Office 365 completely, and\n\n447\n00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:28.560\nyou just wanna test it out for\na few months, well it might benefit you.\n\n448\n00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:35.260\nIt might benefit you to go to the monthly\nplan versus the yearly subscription.\n\n449\n00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.490\nNow moving into some of\nthe offerings with this plan,\n\n450\n00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:45.440\nwe have the very first one which is\nthe just the business essentials plan.\n\n451\n00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.150\nNow the business essentials plan,\nthere's a whole laundry list here, right?\n\n452\n00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.000\nThere's a whole list of different\nthings that it does for you,\n\n453\n00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.510\nbut if I could just help out.\n\n454\n00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.823\nWe'll help the users out here and\nkinda sum up what this plan does.\n\n455\n00:24:57.823 --> 00:25:01.772\nWe're talking about 300 users,\nwe're talking about, you can see,\n\n456\n00:25:01.772 --> 00:25:03.056\n$5 to $6 per month.\n\n457\n00:25:03.056 --> 00:25:04.816\n&gt;&gt; Do I have to have 300 users?\n\n458\n00:25:04.816 --> 00:25:06.336\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n459\n00:25:06.336 --> 00:25:09.140\n[LAUGH] Maximum is 300 users.\n\n460\n00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.368\nThank you there for that.\n\n461\n00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:12.916\nYou can scale up to 300 users on this one.\n\n462\n00:25:12.916 --> 00:25:15.520\nAgain, it's $5 to $6 per month.\n\n463\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.669\nIt includes email with about 50 gigs per\nuser, so you have your online Outlook.\n\n464\n00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.240\nIt's interesting on this one,\none terabyte of storage per user.\n\n465\n00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.108\nNow that's pretty interesting.\n\n466\n00:25:28.108 --> 00:25:30.416\nCan you imagine if you did have 300 users?\n\n467\n00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:36.468\n300 terabytes of data is what they offer\nyou for that price, which is kinda cool.\n\n468\n00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:41.870\nThe other thing is HD video conferencing,\nyou also have that ability too.\n\n469\n00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:46.770\nSo if you're a smaller company and\nyou can't afford, we've got some HD\n\n470\n00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:50.130\nconferencing systems and I've seen\nthe cameras on those things alone.\n\n471\n00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:54.590\nThe cameras are $7,000 and\nthen that's one and\n\n472\n00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.200\nif you do video conferencing\nwhat usually do you require?\n\n473\n00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.260\nSomebody on the other end?\n\n474\n00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.116\nWell, now you're into $14,000 just for\nthe two cameras that can attach to these.\n\n475\n00:26:03.116 --> 00:26:08.058\nSo that's a good way that you can offload\nthis infrastructure to Microsoft.\n\n476\n00:26:08.058 --> 00:26:11.374\nAnd you can say, well, just give us\nthat functionality and feature, and\n\n477\n00:26:11.374 --> 00:26:12.926\nthen we don't have to maintain and\n\n478\n00:26:12.926 --> 00:26:17.080\nmanage all of the high definition\nvideo conferencing system behind it.\n\n479\n00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.998\nNow, one of the things that this\nincludes is the Office Online,\n\n480\n00:26:21.998 --> 00:26:26.290\nthis is where we get into\nthe true software as a service.\n\n481\n00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:30.515\nYou aren't gonna have the ability to do\nany local installations of Office and\n\n482\n00:26:30.515 --> 00:26:34.340\nyou're gonna have to connect\nthrough the web browser.\n\n483\n00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.210\nSo there again, this might be something\nyou can use with a thin client.\n\n484\n00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.070\nMaybe I've got thin clients.\n\n485\n00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.847\nWe don't have a lot of money to purchase\nI7 processors and stuff in our machines,\n\n486\n00:26:43.847 --> 00:26:46.146\nand the graphics cards,\nand the hard drives, but\n\n487\n00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:47.808\nyou can connect with a thin client.\n\n488\n00:26:47.808 --> 00:26:49.012\nYou don't need much power here,\n\n489\n00:26:49.012 --> 00:26:51.590\nbecause everything's gonna be done\nthrough the web browser itself.\n\n490\n00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.410\nSo, if you do use this plan,\n\n491\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.820\nmake sure you got a good internet\nconnection on whatever the device is,\n\n492\n00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.840\nbecause everything is gonna be handled\nthrough that internet connection.\n\n493\n00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:04.950\nNow, the next one,\nis the Office 365 Business.\n\n494\n00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.749\nNow, there's no email in this one.\n\n495\n00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.560\nI found that interesting.\n\n496\n00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.390\n&gt;&gt; That is very interesting,\n\n497\n00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:14.850\ncuz you would think that if I move up to,\nyou've got essentials.\n\n498\n00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.648\nThat makes sense, it's a stripped\ndown version of Office 365.\n\n499\n00:27:18.648 --> 00:27:21.983\nAnd then you move to business, not\nbusiness essentials that you wouldn't lose\n\n500\n00:27:21.983 --> 00:27:24.236\nthings like,\nthe most important thing, the email.\n\n501\n00:27:24.236 --> 00:27:27.618\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and, [LAUGH] that is confusing,\nvery confusing.\n\n502\n00:27:27.618 --> 00:27:33.250\nSo, make sure you know these plans\ngoing into the MTA cloud fundamentals.\n\n503\n00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.720\nNow, that doesn't mean you have\nto know every single jot and\n\n504\n00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.191\ntotal here in the plan itself,\nbut just realize something,\n\n505\n00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:44.568\nif they set up with a question and\nthey say okay, you need email, all right.\n\n506\n00:27:44.568 --> 00:27:49.878\nKnow that business by itself\nisn't gonna give you that.\n\n507\n00:27:49.878 --> 00:27:53.202\nMy only thought on that Dan\nis maybe they say, okay,\n\n508\n00:27:53.202 --> 00:27:57.448\nthis business is managing its own\ninternal mail infrastructure.\n\n509\n00:27:57.448 --> 00:28:03.888\nNow, they get a lot of the same\nthings that you get in the business,\n\n510\n00:28:03.888 --> 00:28:07.860\nyou still get the 300 users, right?\n\n511\n00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.059\nBut one of the differences, you could see\nthe price difference for instance, well,\n\n512\n00:28:12.059 --> 00:28:13.938\nnow you can see the price difference.\n\n513\n00:28:13.938 --> 00:28:17.254\nWhen we look at yearly versus monthly,\n\n514\n00:28:17.254 --> 00:28:21.678\nwe're talking $8.25 versus $10 per user.\n\n515\n00:28:21.678 --> 00:28:25.974\nBut one of the big things that does\ndiffer between these two is a full\n\n516\n00:28:25.974 --> 00:28:28.300\ninstallation of the Office Suite.\n\n517\n00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.460\nSo, Office 2016, if you wanna\ndownload it to your computers,\n\n518\n00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.240\nnow you have the full entire Office Suite.\n\n519\n00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.950\nNow, is that beneficial?\n\n520\n00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:40.270\nWell, maybe, I do have computers and\nmaybe I do have laptops, right?\n\n521\n00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:46.080\nAs we get to maybe a larger company, maybe\nI want the ability that if the internet\n\n522\n00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.680\nconnection goes down, I don't lose all\nproductivity with inside of my business.\n\n523\n00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.140\nWell, if I have the full Office Suite,\nthen that means it's downloaded locally,\n\n524\n00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.380\nand I can also redirect\nthat information if I want.\n\n525\n00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.460\nNot only to the cloud like\nthe OneDrive online, but\n\n526\n00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.930\nwe can even direct it just like we do\nif we didn't even use the cloud, right?\n\n527\n00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.320\nWe can manage some of that\ninformation on premise, too.\n\n528\n00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.360\nSo this is good also for a scenario where\nmaybe you have a hybrid scenario where you\n\n529\n00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.690\nneed to use on premise and\nyou need to use Cloud.\n\n530\n00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.570\nOne of the last ones in the Business\nPremium, Dan, for this one, sums up.\n\n531\n00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.970\nAnd let me just mention one more\nthing on the Business plan,\n\n532\n00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.620\nyou get the mobile support.\n\n533\n00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.695\nThat's one of the things that you\ndon't get in the Business Essentials.\n\n534\n00:29:25.695 --> 00:29:28.215\nYou get tablet and\nphone support and that's important.\n\n535\n00:29:28.215 --> 00:29:30.315\nOne of the last ones is\nthe Business Premium.\n\n536\n00:29:30.315 --> 00:29:33.455\nIt's a little bit more expensive $12.50,\n\n537\n00:29:33.455 --> 00:29:36.655\n$15 if you're doing\na monthly subscription.\n\n538\n00:29:36.655 --> 00:29:37.955\nAnd what this one does, basically,\n\n539\n00:29:37.955 --> 00:29:40.615\nis combines the features\nof both plans together.\n\n540\n00:29:40.615 --> 00:29:41.255\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n541\n00:29:41.255 --> 00:29:45.705\nNow, Wes I know you have a little bit\nmore to go over as far as some plans and\n\n542\n00:29:45.705 --> 00:29:48.200\npricings and\nthe differences between those.\n\n543\n00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.720\nI'm willing to let the show go a little\nlong as long as we're not gonna go crazy.\n\n544\n00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, that might be something\nthat we have save for a part two.\n\n545\n00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:54.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we're gonna go part two,\nokay that's fine.\n\n546\n00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.460\n&gt;&gt; Cuz, yeah,\nwhen you get into the enterprise stuff,\n\n547\n00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.370\nthere's a lot more than just\nthe basic business stuff.\n\n548\n00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:03.820\nSo I think it probably be better for\nall of us if we save that for a part two.\n\n549\n00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.230\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWell, that's what we'll do then and\n\n550\n00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.200\nthat sounds great.\n\n551\n00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.490\nWhat you showed us so far is something\nnot only is it practical, right, but\n\n552\n00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:10.390\nit's gonna be great for us.\n\n553\n00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.440\nSay if something comes up at\nthe exam what would be the pricing\n\n554\n00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.072\nplan you wanna go with?\n\n555\n00:30:14.072 --> 00:30:16.540\nWhat kinda plan would you need if\nyou were this type of business?\n\n556\n00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.420\nYou can field those questions\nwith out much issue there.\n\n557\n00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.470\nWe're gonna continue that in part two.\n\n558\n00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.328\nLook forward to seeing you there.\n\n559\n00:30:23.328 --> 00:30:26.600\nThanks for joining us today Wes and\nthank you for joining us as well.\n\n560\n00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.200\nWe're gonna go ahead and\n\n561\n00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.230\nsign off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n562\n00:30:30.230 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.640\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.810\nwe are continuing on with\nour MTA cloud fundamentals.\n\n5\n00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.680\nAnd joining me yet again for this part\ntwo is my good friend and colleague, and\n\n6\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.405\nthe man that knows all about these pricing\nplans we're gonna take a look at, is Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:30.020\nWes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.670\nWes, welcome back to the show,\nhow you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.540\n>> I'm doing great and\nthanks for having me back again.\n\n10\n00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.340\nThat's right, we are moving through\nenabling cloud services here,\n\n11\n00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.630\nso it looks like I'm an enabler today.\n\n12\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.379\nAnd we get to plan the plans\nthat we're gonna plan here so-\n\n13\n00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.080\n>> Plan the plan, to make a plan.\n\n14\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.378\n>> To make a plan,\nsounds real bureaucratic, right?\n\n15\n00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:52.049\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, in the previous episode,\n\n16\n00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.020\nwe ended on the business plans.\n\n17\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.460\nAnd the business plans, for\nthe most part, are smaller businesses.\n\n18\n00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.890\nAnd remember one of the capacity, the\nlimitations is it scales up to 300 users.\n\n19\n00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.254\nBut maybe you are a large organization.\n\n20\n00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:07.680\nOr maybe you work for\na large organization, and\n\n21\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.940\nthey're considering moving some of their\ninfrastructure into the cloud as well.\n\n22\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.200\nAnd maybe they want to have some of\nthe Office 365 available to them.\n\n23\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.660\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n24\n00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.671\nThese Enterprise plans have\nan interesting classification here.\n\n25\n00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:30.410\nAnd I'm not really too worried about\nthings like your Office ProPlus here.\n\n26\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.390\nAnd we're not really getting into some of\nthe other ones here like the education,\n\n27\n00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.560\ngovernment, nonprofit, and home.\n\n28\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.490\nWe're gonna look at the enterprise level\ncuz I think that's gonna be more common,\n\n29\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.120\nand probably most likely what\nthey're gonna ask you on the exam.\n\n30\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.450\nThe very first one that we look\nat here is E1, the E1 plan.\n\n31\n00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.900\nNow, with the E1 plan, one of the things\nthat you might remember, and if you don't,\n\n32\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.180\ngo back and check it out.\n\n33\n00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.340\nFrom the first part of this episode,\nis the fact that we had monthly and\n\n34\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.890\nwe had annual subscriptions.\n\n35\n00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.990\nNotice that there's no drop-down here.\n\n36\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.850\nIn the enterprise level plans,\n\n37\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.150\nthey don't give you the option to\nsubscribe on a month-by-month basis.\n\n38\n00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.730\nIf you're going to move\ninto enterprise level\n\n39\n00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.240\nplans then your company is gonna be\nrequired to enter into an annual contract.\n\n40\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.590\nSo, that is something that you have\nto consider if you want to do this,\n\n41\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.210\nmaybe temporarily,\nmaybe you're trying this out.\n\n42\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.460\nAgain, keep in mind that once\nyou enter into this contract,\n\n43\n00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.880\nyou're gonna be stuck with it for a year.\n\n44\n00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.950\nSo, whatever your business model is,\n\n45\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.100\nand your pricing,\nyou'll have to plan accordingly for that.\n\n46\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.930\n>> Yeah, Wes, and that really makes sense.\n\n47\n00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.990\nIf you've ever worked in enterprise level\nand you've been a part of budget meetings,\n\n48\n00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.440\nyou'll say, well yeah,\nthat's just how we do things.\n\n49\n00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.930\nBecause that's how we do things\nat the enterprise level.\n\n50\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.360\nWe have a budget meeting for\nthe rest of the year, or for\n\n51\n00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.880\nthe next year should I say.\n\n52\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.480\nAnd what do you want to put in there?\n\n53\n00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.150\nWell, we need a pricing for our\nOffice Suite Solution, so we go ahead and\n\n54\n00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.130\nmake that year long commitment.\n\n55\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.120\nWe're gonna pay that money anyway,\n\n56\n00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.200\nmight as well go ahead, and\ncorrect me if I'm wrong here, Wesley.\n\n57\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.020\nBut they give you a bit of a,\n\n58\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.500\ndo they give you a price break on\npaying for that whole year or is it\n\n59\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.940\nthey're just giving you the breakdown\non what it will cost you monthly?\n\n60\n00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.036\n>> Well, in the business plans,\nif you pay month-by-month,\n\n61\n00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:10.712\nyou have to pay a little bit more.\n\n62\n00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:14.930\nIf you pay the annual contract,\nthen you are gonna get a price break.\n\n63\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.921\nHere in the enterprise level though,\nyou do have the option.\n\n64\n00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.534\nYou can pay month-by-month or you can pay\none lump sum and you can pay the whole\n\n65\n00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:25.173\nthing for the year, but you don't really\nget a price break in the Enterprise.\n\n66\n00:03:25.173 --> 00:03:27.921\nSo, in a smaller business, they do\nkinda cut you a little bit of a break.\n\n67\n00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:31.120\nIn the Enterprise,\nit's pretty much a fixed fee.\n\n68\n00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.770\nAnd you could still pay it by the month,\nor you can go ahead and\n\n69\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.280\nsay, you know what?\n\n70\n00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.110\nI'm gonna fork the check over and I'll\ngive you a whole entire year right here.\n\n71\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.504\nThey don't care how much you've\nbudgeted for this, they want all that.\n\n72\n00:03:40.504 --> 00:03:42.546\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, they want all that, yeah.\n\n73\n00:03:42.546 --> 00:03:43.338\n>> Gotcha.\n\n74\n00:03:43.338 --> 00:03:44.720\n>> So, yeah, definitely keep that in mind.\n\n75\n00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.360\nAnd that's another reason you\nreally have to consider your plan.\n\n76\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.900\nNow, $8 a month here is for\nthe E1 level subscription here.\n\n77\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.510\nYou don't get the full installation\nof the Office Suite here.\n\n78\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.150\nBut you do have unlimited users, and\nthat's one of the big differences between\n\n79\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.010\nthe business plans and\nthe enterprise level plans.\n\n80\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.438\nNow, you also get your\n50 gigs of email per\n\n81\n00:04:13.438 --> 00:04:18.879\nuser just like we got\nin the business plans.\n\n82\n00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.979\nNow, the other thing\nthat it kind of helps for\n\n83\n00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.970\nthe enterprise level is that they\ndon't cap you on your intranet sites.\n\n84\n00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.460\nYou get unlimited intranet sites,\nyou get unlimited online meeting.\n\n85\n00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.120\nNow, one of the things that's interesting\nis that you don't get access.\n\n86\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.530\nNow, I've always thought that's funny.\n\n87\n00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.160\nThis is software as a service,\n\n88\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.610\nyou need a web browser to access\nthe Internet to access this service.\n\n89\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.231\nAnd then they tell you right here at\nthe plan, no Access or plus Access.\n\n90\n00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:48.379\nWhat are they talking about there?\n\n91\n00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.762\nThey're actually talking about\nthe application that's part of\n\n92\n00:04:50.762 --> 00:04:51.461\nthe Office Suite.\n\n93\n00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:55.971\nThey're not telling you, sign up,\ngive us $25 a month per user and\n\n94\n00:04:55.971 --> 00:04:57.500\nwe give you no access.\n\n95\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.820\nSo, they don't really mean it that way.\n\n96\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.950\nThe other that we have again,\nnote on the E1 level,\n\n97\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.470\nthere isn't any mobile support, so\nyou also have to keep that in mind.\n\n98\n00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.630\nDo you have tablets,\ndo you have mobile phones?\n\n99\n00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.872\nIf you do and you need to support them,\n\n100\n00:05:12.872 --> 00:05:16.930\nwell this is not going to be or\nisn't going to be the plan for you.\n\n101\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.800\nThe other thing that we also have to look\nat is enterprise level app management.\n\n102\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.480\nYou don't get those features\nin the E1 level either,\n\n103\n00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.420\nso-\n>> Now, Wes,\n\n104\n00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.640\nI'm sitting here looking at the plan,\n\n105\n00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.760\nand some of the details\nthat are involved with it.\n\n106\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.809\nAnd really it strikes me that,\ndepending on your environment,\n\n107\n00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.338\nyou may not want to go with this.\n\n108\n00:05:35.338 --> 00:05:39.981\nBecause a lot of the stuff that they\noffer you with this E1 plan is also\n\n109\n00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:43.921\navailable in the Office,\nwhat is it, the business plan?\n\n110\n00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:44.860\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n>> The Business Essentials?\n\n111\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.570\n>> That's right, so\nwhy would we want one over the other?\n\n112\n00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.770\nThat's a great question.\n\n113\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.950\nFirst of all is the cap on users,\nthat's one of the things that we have to\n\n114\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.480\nthink about, 300 users in the business\nplan versus unlimited users.\n\n115\n00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.388\nThe other thing is,\nas far as your SharePoint sites, I mean,\n\n116\n00:05:59.388 --> 00:06:03.010\nthey just blow the lid off of this one,\nit's unlimited.\n\n117\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.600\nYou don't have a restriction or\na cap on how many sites that you can set.\n\n118\n00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.050\nAnd as far as your online meetings,\nthink about any time you have some kinda\n\n119\n00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.570\nhigh definition conferencing, your online\nmeetings, that's taking resources, right?\n\n120\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.720\nSo, in the enterprise level\nthey don't tell you well,\n\n121\n00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.970\nyou're limited to a certain\namount of online meetings and\n\n122\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.410\nwe'll cap you at that like they\ndo in some of the business plans.\n\n123\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.200\nThey say you have as many as you want.\n\n124\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.030\nYou need 4 or 500 of these meetings,\n\n125\n00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.550\nwell go ahead, we've got the bandwidth and\nthat's part of your subscription.\n\n126\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.710\nSo, keep in mind that\nthe Enterprise level 1\n\n127\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.830\ndoes have some of its limitations, right,\nI don't get the full install of Office.\n\n128\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.240\nNow, just like we talked about\nin some of the business plans,\n\n129\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.390\nthat might be a problem for my company.\n\n130\n00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.740\nWhy?\nWell,\n\n131\n00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.260\nbecause if you think about it, if you\ndon't have an Internet connection, right.\n\n132\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.140\nIf you don't have an internet\nconnection in all of this,\n\n133\n00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.540\nyou're not gonna be able\nto connect to Office 365.\n\n134\n00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.030\nBut think of it from\na productivity stance, right.\n\n135\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.500\nIf I lose Internet connectivity, I lose\naccess, all access to the online web app.\n\n136\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.580\nSo, that's where you might want\nto move into something like\n\n137\n00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.250\ntheir E3 subscription or their E3 tier.\n\n138\n00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.870\nThat's funny now, now you get Access.\n\n139\n00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.710\nYou didn't get Access before,\nnow you get Access.\n\n140\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.250\nAnd again, joking aside, they're talking\nabout a application inside of Office 365.\n\n141\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.260\nThis is quite pricey.\n\n142\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.800\nYou look at the jump here and\nwe're going from, on average,\n\n143\n00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.810\nthe highest price subscription in the\nbusiness plan was the Business Premium.\n\n144\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.153\nAnd that was $15 per user if\nyou were doing it per month.\n\n145\n00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:41.750\nThis is $20, this is $5 per user,\nand we don't have any breaks here.\n\n146\n00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.970\nSo, what are some of the things\nthat we have to look at here?\n\n147\n00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.830\nYou get all the features that\nyou see inside of the E1 plan.\n\n148\n00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.450\nSo, now they're starting\nto compound on each other.\n\n149\n00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.336\nYou get all the features of the E1 plan.\n\n150\n00:07:52.336 --> 00:07:56.440\nBut now you get Access, right,\nbecause maybe you're a larger company.\n\n151\n00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.780\nMaybe you have some users\nconnecting to databases,\n\n152\n00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:05.470\nyou got a lot of need for\nthe Access application.\n\n153\n00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.046\nWell then,\nyou have access to Access [LAUGH].\n\n154\n00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:12.296\nThe other thing is the email.\n\n155\n00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:15.960\nThe first one does have 50 gigs\nper user when it comes to email.\n\n156\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.410\nWhen you get into the E3 tier,\nit's an unlimited, unlimited inbox size.\n\n157\n00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.799\nSo, if you've got somebody that is\nhitting that 50 gigs, first of all,\n\n158\n00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:28.087\nthey need to clean up their\ninbox if email's just text.\n\n159\n00:08:28.087 --> 00:08:29.537\nBut it's-\n>> Good luck with that, Wes.\n\n160\n00:08:29.537 --> 00:08:31.144\n>> That's right.\n>> I've been down that road with people\n\n161\n00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:34.212\nwith large inboxes, and they just look\nat you and go, I need that email.\n\n162\n00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:36.954\n>> You need that email now-\n>> I need those spam mails that I got that\n\n163\n00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:38.853\nare sitting in my deleted [LAUGH] inbox.\n\n164\n00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:43.060\n>> Yeah, that's right, and all those\nPDFs from five years ago, of course.\n\n165\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.760\nYou never know, one day,\nyou're gonna need it.\n\n166\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.300\nSo, that'd be a good thing for you,\nand that'd probably saved you a lot of\n\n167\n00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.590\nheadache too there, Dan,\nis an unlimited email inbox size.\n\n168\n00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.650\nNow, we start moving into the support for\nmobile devices.\n\n169\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.850\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat does set this apart here.\n\n170\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.350\nYou can see Office on tablets and\nphones here.\n\n171\n00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.110\nAnd what's really interesting here is 5\ntablets and 5 phones per user, right?\n\n172\n00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:14.532\nSo, we're really talking about scaling up,\nwe're not just saying, okay, if you've\n\n173\n00:09:14.532 --> 00:09:19.254\ngot five phones within your network,\nyou get five installations of Office.\n\n174\n00:09:19.254 --> 00:09:20.760\nNo, we're talking per user.\n\n175\n00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.840\nYou get five different instances of the\ninstallation based on your licensing here.\n\n176\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.890\nThe other thing that you start to get\ntoo is Enterprise app management,\n\n177\n00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.810\na consolidated view of your applications.\n\n178\n00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:37.576\nWe're not just talking about logging into\nOffice 365 Administration Center and\n\n179\n00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:39.463\nmanaging your infrastructure.\n\n180\n00:09:39.463 --> 00:09:44.307\nBut we're talking about managing the\napplications themselves from an enterprise\n\n181\n00:09:44.307 --> 00:09:46.254\nlevel, which is a nice feature.\n\n182\n00:09:46.254 --> 00:09:50.690\nNow, a lot of the companies have to worry\nabout things like legalities, rightk,\n\n183\n00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.410\nwe've talked about that.\n\n184\n00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.740\nThings like compliance, and\nwe've mentioned the compliance\n\n185\n00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.070\nthat Office 365 will meet in other\nepisodes, go back and check them out.\n\n186\n00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.547\nBut what if you want your\ncompany to be protected, right?\n\n187\n00:10:02.547 --> 00:10:07.167\nOne of the benefits of using software as\na service is that the security team is on\n\n188\n00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:09.140\nthe Microsoft's side, right?\n\n189\n00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.070\nThey're the ones\nresearching the standards,\n\n190\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.320\nthey're the ones making sure\nthat they're up to date.\n\n191\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.620\nWell, when you get into the E3 plan,\n\n192\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.455\nyou get the option to have your\ncompliance and information protection.\n\n193\n00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:22.501\nThey back it.\n\n194\n00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:25.795\nThey say okay, well we're gonna take\ncare and we'll monitor the compliance\n\n195\n00:10:25.795 --> 00:10:28.905\nregulations and that we'll make\nsure that you are in compliance.\n\n196\n00:10:28.905 --> 00:10:32.980\nAnd if you're not, we're gonna\nfinancially back you with that so\n\n197\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.640\nthat you don't have to worry about it.\n\n198\n00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.788\nSo, it's another good thing when\nyou use software as a service.\n\n199\n00:10:37.788 --> 00:10:40.910\nIs that you're really\njust alleviating yourself\n\n200\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.870\nfrom a large compliance team that you\nmight have to hire in order to make sure\n\n201\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.520\nthat you remain legal with whatever local,\nfederal, state regulations, or\n\n202\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.300\neven country regulations if\nyou're on international soil.\n\n203\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:00.670\nThat is really what kinda\nmakes the E3 plan stand out.\n\n204\n00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.640\nThe last one is the E5 plan, and this is a\nnewer plan that was set out for Microsoft.\n\n205\n00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.640\nAnd this combines all the functionality\nand features, just kinda like we've\n\n206\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.870\nseen in the Business Premium, right,\nof the E1 plan and the E3 plan.\n\n207\n00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:21.300\nBut now we're getting features like\nadvanced malware protection, right?\n\n208\n00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.700\nWe can look down here and\nwe've got, yep, here we go.\n\n209\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.070\nSo, advanced security that\nhelps protect your data.\n\n210\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.862\nYou can see they don't offer that\nin the three lower tier plans.\n\n211\n00:11:32.862 --> 00:11:38.330\nZero-day viruses, malware, so you get that\nthreat mitigation, that threat protection.\n\n212\n00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.580\nWhich is, I mean, it's good for\n\n213\n00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.740\nany business but now they're saying hey,\nwe're gonna manage this for you.\n\n214\n00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.390\nWe're gonna manage your security\ninfrastructure as far as malware goes and\n\n215\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.540\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n216\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.754\n>> Just another thing you\ncan chuck onto their plates.\n\n217\n00:11:50.754 --> 00:11:51.505\n>> That's right.\n\n218\n00:11:51.505 --> 00:11:52.712\n>> And take it off of your own, right?\n\n219\n00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.178\n>> Absolutely,\nnot having to worry about it.\n\n220\n00:11:55.178 --> 00:11:57.950\nAgain, if your capital,\n\n221\n00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:03.680\nyour finances can't really justify having\nthat kinda team on site, on premise.\n\n222\n00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.630\nAnd you certainly don't\nwanna outsource it and\n\n223\n00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.260\nhave a complete third party come in\non premise and take care of this.\n\n224\n00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.025\nYou can say, well you know what,\nMicrosoft, we'll go ahead and\n\n225\n00:12:12.025 --> 00:12:14.756\npay you a subscription fee, and\nyou can take care of that for us.\n\n226\n00:12:14.756 --> 00:12:16.932\nNow, the big thing that really,\n\n227\n00:12:16.932 --> 00:12:21.069\nreally sets the E5 apart is\nthe voice over IP infrastructure.\n\n228\n00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.120\nYou get Skype Online for\nBusiness in a lot of these plans.\n\n229\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.970\nBut one of the big\ndifferences between E5 plan\n\n230\n00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:34.560\nis we're talking online web\nconnections through the web interface.\n\n231\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.185\nYou probably have been a part of an online\nconferencing system where you've been able\n\n232\n00:12:39.185 --> 00:12:40.550\nto pull out your phone, right?\n\n233\n00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:45.210\nYou dial in the number and\nyou connect to whatever the conference is,\n\n234\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.510\nwhether it's mobile phone or\nmaybe it's land line.\n\n235\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.850\nMaybe you need to pick up a land line and\nyou need to call and\n\n236\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.060\ndial in to an online conferencing meeting.\n\n237\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.460\nWell, in the lower tiers, you don't\nget the dial in conferencing option.\n\n238\n00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:01.970\nThat is something that is strictly limited\nto the E5 plan that you get that dial in.\n\n239\n00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.010\nThey call it here on their\nsites there if you'll see,\n\n240\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.560\nthey talk about PSTN conferencing.\n\n241\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.990\nBut that's really what they mean there,\nthey mean the dial in.\n\n242\n00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.450\nIt's the fact that you can\nset up a Microsoft bridge.\n\n243\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:17.630\nThey'll take care of it, they've plenty\nof numbers for whatever your region is.\n\n244\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.590\nYou can set that number, you can call\nthat number, and you dial into any of\n\n245\n00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:26.470\nthe online conferences from any kind\nof mobile phone or even land line.\n\n246\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.140\nAnd one of the last things, again,\n\n247\n00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.800\nthat really sets this E5\nsupport apart is the Cloud PBX.\n\n248\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.540\nIf you're not familiar with the term PBX,\n\n249\n00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.870\nI would definitely recommend checking out\nthe acronym, checking out the definition.\n\n250\n00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.610\nThat's private branch exchange.\n\n251\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:47.030\nAs far as Cloud PBX means,\nthat means it's inside of the cloud,\n\n252\n00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.180\nthey're gonna manage\nthe private branch exchange.\n\n253\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.004\nYou don't have to have\nall the infrastructure.\n\n254\n00:13:50.004 --> 00:13:51.895\nIf you're using voice over IP phones,\n\n255\n00:13:51.895 --> 00:13:55.360\nyou're probably familiar with\nthis inside of your own company.\n\n256\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.546\nThat SIP communications, it takes a lot,\nright, we have to manage.\n\n257\n00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:02.537\nI say we [LAUGH], Don Pezet here has\nto manage a lot of the voice over IP\n\n258\n00:14:02.537 --> 00:14:05.337\ncommunications that we\nhave on this network.\n\n259\n00:14:05.337 --> 00:14:08.640\nAnd it can be very complex and\ntime consuming.\n\n260\n00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.720\nAnd if you don't have that infrastructure,\nyou don't have the know how, or\n\n261\n00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.360\nmaybe you don't want to hire the team.\n\n262\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.609\nYou can say, you know what,\nwe're gonna let the cloud PBX,\n\n263\n00:14:17.609 --> 00:14:20.046\nwe'll let that part of\nthat go to Microsoft.\n\n264\n00:14:20.046 --> 00:14:24.690\nAnd they'll manage routing those phone\ncalls as they come into your corporation.\n\n265\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:25.672\nAnd we don't have to worry about it.\n\n266\n00:14:25.672 --> 00:14:29.060\nAnd the great thing too with\ncloud PBX is in general,\n\n267\n00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.865\nas a standard you have what's\ncalled a PBX parachute.\n\n268\n00:14:32.865 --> 00:14:35.955\nWhich means if the private branch\nexchange that they're using goes offline,\n\n269\n00:14:35.955 --> 00:14:37.585\nthey've got another one that comes online.\n\n270\n00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:38.935\nSo you've got redundancy there,\n\n271\n00:14:38.935 --> 00:14:41.672\nas we've talked about in some\nof the previous episodes.\n\n272\n00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:47.572\nBecause as you know, you certainly don't\nwant to have that type of subscription.\n\n273\n00:14:47.572 --> 00:14:51.882\nCall into some very important meeting\nwhere hopefully you're gonna land the next\n\n274\n00:14:51.882 --> 00:14:56.596\nbig million dollar contract and,\neverything's lost.\n\n275\n00:14:56.596 --> 00:14:59.231\n[LAUGH] So, it's good to have\nthe cloud parachutes too, and\n\n276\n00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:00.911\nit's all part of that infrastructure.\n\n277\n00:15:00.911 --> 00:15:03.231\n>> Yeah, it's a really nice\nthing to have that Skype for\n\n278\n00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:08.011\nbusiness, that PBX side of\nthe Office Suite there for you.\n\n279\n00:15:08.011 --> 00:15:13.111\nBecause, I was with Don, we were trying\nto vet out what system do we wanna go to?\n\n280\n00:15:13.111 --> 00:15:16.128\nBecause, we wanted to A,\nnot have to manage the thing.\n\n281\n00:15:16.128 --> 00:15:18.696\nRight, we have enough on our\nplates here in the show,\n\n282\n00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:20.970\ntrying to just give you\nguys great content.\n\n283\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.750\nIt's one less thing that\nwe have to worry about.\n\n284\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.610\nThis was a great solution for us, right?\n\n285\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.100\nThey take care of everything.\n\n286\n00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.900\nAnd the phones that we already had, or\n\n287\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.870\nwe could get other phones,\njust about any kind of phone we wanted.\n\n288\n00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.230\nWe could use that as well.\n\n289\n00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.340\nSo, that was a very great benefit for\nus to go to this system.\n\n290\n00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.070\nThen when Don started to set it up,\nit was an easy setup.\n\n291\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:42.060\nHe said this thing is so butter smooth,\nthis is the way we're gonna go.\n\n292\n00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.610\nAnd the pricing was competitive\nwith every other thing.\n\n293\n00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.146\nNot to mention the fact that\nwe already had Office 365, and\n\n294\n00:15:49.146 --> 00:15:52.004\nthe tier that we were using\noffered this service.\n\n295\n00:15:52.004 --> 00:15:54.505\nSo, we were using another provider,\nwe said hey,\n\n296\n00:15:54.505 --> 00:15:57.980\nwe're already actually paying for\nthis inside of what we're using.\n\n297\n00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.840\nMight as well go ahead and\njust tack this on and use all in one.\n\n298\n00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.370\nSo, it becomes a one point of contact,\nright.\n\n299\n00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.600\nI no longer have 16\nvendors I gotta work with.\n\n300\n00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.340\nI got one vendor,\nMicrosoft, I go with them.\n\n301\n00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.690\nI got them for my Office suite,\nnow I've got them for my PBX as well.\n\n302\n00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.420\nConsolidates all that and\nmakes my life as a manager or\n\n303\n00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.150\nas an admin a whole lot easier, and\nwe're a big fan of the system so far.\n\n304\n00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.079\n>> Definitely, and I remember you going\nthrough some of the studying you had to\n\n305\n00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:23.560\ndo, cuz you have to do your research.\n\n306\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:30.220\nYou have to find out what's competitive,\ncompetitive pricing, and then, what works.\n\n307\n00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.879\nDo you have to add all these\nlittle add-ons to make it work?\n\n308\n00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:37.126\nAnd do you have to pay for each little\n[LAUGH] add on and functionality and\n\n309\n00:16:37.126 --> 00:16:37.970\nfeature?\n\n310\n00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.810\nAnd it's good to see here,\nand thank you too for that,\n\n311\n00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.750\nDan, to see that you have\nit all here in Office 365.\n\n312\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.880\nSo, you can see that,\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n313\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.940\nif you are an organization that can\nafford a price point like this,\n\n314\n00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.000\nyou really can integrate the entire\ninfrastructure into a single package.\n\n315\n00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.460\nAnd your paying one bill instead of five\nor six little, well maybe not little,\n\n316\n00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.870\nmaybe expensive modular little\nbills across the board.\n\n317\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:06.910\nSo, when it comes to the plans, Dan,\nI would know what's not involved\n\n318\n00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:11.712\nin one plan over the other,\nversus knowing everything in the plan.\n\n319\n00:17:11.712 --> 00:17:14.230\nSo, for instance,\njust as a real quick little recap.\n\n320\n00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.337\nRemember in the E1 you don't get email.\n\n321\n00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:20.500\nLet me make sure I'm saying that right.\n\n322\n00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:25.270\nNo, no I apologize,\nyou get 50 gigs of email in the E1 plan.\n\n323\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.463\nWell, if 50 gigs might seem like a cap,\nknow that you can't go over 50 gigs.\n\n324\n00:17:29.463 --> 00:17:34.082\nAnd they might ask you a question that\nsays you have a user that, on average,\n\n325\n00:17:34.082 --> 00:17:39.410\naverages about 65 gigs in their inboxes,\ncould the E1 plan work for them?\n\n326\n00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.370\nWell, it wouldn't, they'd have to up\nto something like the E3 where they\n\n327\n00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.390\nbust the cap off of that and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n328\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.140\nSo, know the plans.\n\n329\n00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.870\nYou don't have to know every\nindividual specific point, but\n\n330\n00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.940\ndefinitely know some of\nthe highlight features and\n\n331\n00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.120\nI think you'll be doing really good\non the MTA Cloud Fundamentals exam.\n\n332\n00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.380\n>> Awesome, well Wes,\nI know that you have more.\n\n333\n00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.440\nNow, that we've figured out the plan,\nwe made a plan to make a plan.\n\n334\n00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.837\nAnd now-\n>> To make a plan.\n\n335\n00:18:01.837 --> 00:18:03.270\n>> Now we've made a plan.\n\n336\n00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.090\nNow, it's about time to implement\nthat plan, am I correct?\n\n337\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.754\n>> That's right.\n\n338\n00:18:05.754 --> 00:18:10.710\n>> So, that is a little more than what\ntime is going to allow for us today.\n\n339\n00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.394\nSo Wes, I say we make a part 3 to\nthis guy and we round it out and\n\n340\n00:18:13.394 --> 00:18:15.795\nwe actually implement our\nplan that we have in place.\n\n341\n00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:16.504\n>> Sounds good.\n\n342\n00:18:16.504 --> 00:18:19.310\n>> All right, so\nhopefully that's all gonna go smoothly.\n\n343\n00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.670\nI know Wes is gonna be back with us.\n\n344\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.850\nHopefully you'll be back with us as well.\n\n345\n00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:22.860\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n346\n00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.950\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n347\n00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.270\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n348\n00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.000\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n349\n00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.211\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n350\n00:18:29.211 --> 00:18:33.679\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.340\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.420\nIn today's episode, we're continuing on\nwith a little bit of a miniseries we have\n\n5\n00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.110\ngoing here with our MCA\ncloud fundamentals.\n\n6\n00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.350\nJoining me to help us understand\nthis a little bit better\n\n7\n00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.070\nis none other than my good friend,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.080\nWes, welcome to the show again.\n\n9\n00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.740\nHow are you, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.280\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.060\nIt's great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.440\nAnd, that's right, we're going into\na part three of enabling cloud services.\n\n13\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.400\nAnd, guess what?\n\n14\n00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.790\nWe get to the enabling part now.\n\n15\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.330\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nset up our tenant.\n\n16\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.980\nSo, I'll tell you what,\nlet's go ahead and dive right in here.\n\n17\n00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.000\nIf you haven't seen some of the previous\nepisodes that led us up to this point,\n\n18\n00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.220\ndefinitely check them out because\nplanning is always important.\n\n19\n00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.342\nBut we've done our planning now, and\n\n20\n00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:54.726\nnow it's time to setup one of the Office\n365 plans and get our tenant going.\n\n21\n00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:56.129\nSo let's go ahead and do that now.\n\n22\n00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.435\nWhat I've got here is I've\ngot the E5 plan setup.\n\n23\n00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.056\nFairly expensive plan.\n\n24\n00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:06.620\nYou can see, $35 per user per month.\n\n25\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.020\nThis is a fairly expensive plan,\n\n26\n00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.350\nbut what I really wanna see here is\nthis free trial that they've got.\n\n27\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.190\nSo if you're considering taking this exam,\nmaybe you want to get used to some of\n\n28\n00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.130\nthe Office 365 infrastructure, you can\ndo it and it's not gonna charge you.\n\n29\n00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.850\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose the free trial here.\n\n30\n00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.340\nAnd it's gonna wanna get to\nknow us a little better here so\n\n31\n00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.860\nwe can all hold hands after it's done.\n\n32\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.240\nSo a couple of steps that you gotta do,\nguys.\n\n33\n00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.780\nIt's fairly simplistic setting this up.\n\n34\n00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.030\nBut when we get into some\nof the later set up you're\n\n35\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.440\nreally gonna have to plan accordingly.\n\n36\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.090\nSo first name, who are we gonna do?\n\n37\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.250\nWe're gonna do, maybe we'll do,\nlet's say say Jimi Hendrix here.\n\n38\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.560\n>> He's back from the dead,\nbetter than ever.\n\n39\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.290\n>> He is.\nAnd\n\n40\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.200\nwe'll spell it a little bit\ndifferent out of, Hender.\n\n41\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.215\nOh yeah, we'll spell it completely\ndifferent, not even close.\n\n42\n00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:59.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n43\n00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.490\nwe're going to go ahead\nto your business email.\n\n44\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.130\nKeep in mind,\nwhen you use your business email,\n\n45\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.040\nmake sure you use the appropriate\none because this is\n\n46\n00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.320\nhow they're going to keep you up to date\non any information you need to know.\n\n47\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.690\nIncluding things like your users and\nstuff,\n\n48\n00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.730\nwhen users are created and\nwhen passwords are reset.\n\n49\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.096\nSo it is important here.\n\n50\n00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:21.901\nSo I'll go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:28.345\nput my nameheretoo@outlook.com, right?\n\n52\n00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:30.139\nThat looks like a good number.\n\n53\n00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.668\nAnd then of course we're gonna\nput our legendary number here,\n\n54\n00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:38.093\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.\n\n55\n00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:40.635\nI think that's probably got enough, right?\n\n56\n00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:41.580\n1, 3.\n\n57\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.890\nOkay, we're gonna put another zero here.\n\n58\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.270\nNow, your company name.\n\n59\n00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.280\nWhatever the company name is,\nthat's what we're gonna put here.\n\n60\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.250\nFairly simplistic here, and\nI'll go ahead and put ITProTV.\n\n61\n00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.810\nNow, this isn't gonna be\nwhat your domain's gonna be,\n\n62\n00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.590\nthey just want to know some little\npreliminary information here.\n\n63\n00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.170\nYou know, I don't think I can put\ndashes in here, so we'll put 002.\n\n64\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.810\nAnd now your organization size.\n\n65\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.100\nAnd keep in mind, this is what sets the\ndifference between the business plans and\n\n66\n00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.630\nthe enterprise plans because\nthere's a 300 user maximum.\n\n67\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.610\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and put 301 to 1000.\n\n68\n00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.210\nAnd we're going to choose next.\n\n69\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.160\nNow, this is where your tenant name\nis going to come into play here.\n\n70\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.570\nYou have to be very careful\nwith your tenant name.\n\n71\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.330\nThere's a couple of different\nthings that I've read out there.\n\n72\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.538\nIf you're going to use a trial\nsubscription then maybe you don't want to\n\n73\n00:03:32.538 --> 00:03:33.808\nname it after your company.\n\n74\n00:03:33.808 --> 00:03:38.772\nHowever, Dan and I were talking prior\nto coming live on the show here,\n\n75\n00:03:38.772 --> 00:03:43.402\nthat you really should name this\naccording to what your company is\n\n76\n00:03:43.402 --> 00:03:47.964\nbecause let's say that you do\nname it something weird, right?\n\n77\n00:03:47.964 --> 00:03:50.971\nOff the wall at on microsoft.com.\n\n78\n00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:53.647\nWell, now the problem is\nwhen you do deploy this,\n\n79\n00:03:53.647 --> 00:03:56.388\nnow you've got that crazy\nname as your tenant, and\n\n80\n00:03:56.388 --> 00:03:59.797\nit certainly doesn't reflect\nyour business' name, right?\n\n81\n00:03:59.797 --> 00:04:01.796\nAnd it doesn't look\nprofessional by any means.\n\n82\n00:04:01.796 --> 00:04:05.710\nSo it's probably one of\nthe best pieces of advice.\n\n83\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.200\nIf you are going to, if you do believe\nyou're gonna use this, use your company's\n\n84\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.320\nname so that when you do decide to go live\nwith this you don't have to worry about\n\n85\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.160\nsetting everything up again because\nit's a lot of infrastructure setup.\n\n86\n00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.960\nAnd you finally get it to where you want,\nand\n\n87\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.798\nthen you have to throw out all your work\nbecause you didn't name it appropriately.\n\n88\n00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:28.460\nSo consider the name, your company's name\nis what they call the tenant name, and\n\n89\n00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.570\nyou can not change it after the fact,\nso it is important here.\n\n90\n00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.290\nWe'll create our user name here.\n\n91\n00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.060\nWe'll call this, get that caps lock\noff there, we'll call this Jim.\n\n92\n00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.360\nAnd what are we gonna call our company?\n\n93\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.460\nWe'll call it ITProTV and I'll use\n002 here and see if that's available.\n\n94\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.360\nAl lright.\nLooks like it's available.\n\n95\n00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.890\nNow, you could see for\ninstance if I change this,\n\n96\n00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.710\nbecause I've got another trial\naccount kind of testing these out.\n\n97\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.840\nAnd if I decide that I want to use that\none you can see it's not available.\n\n98\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.350\nSo the good thing about it is if\nthe domain name isn't available,\n\n99\n00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.400\nyou won't be able to register.\n\n100\n00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.470\nIt's gonna tell you to change it.\n\n101\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.310\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n102\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.210\nAll right.\n\n103\n00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.222\nAnd then we're going to use one of our\ncrazy, super secret passwords here.\n\n104\n00:05:14.222 --> 00:05:19.140\nWe've gotta have our super secret\nMicrosoft password that nobody\n\n105\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.320\nis aware of and\nnobody has ever seen in their life.\n\n106\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.320\nYou know dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.\n\n107\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.050\nAnd we'll choose next.\n\n108\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.930\nAll right, now the next thing that we're\ngonna do here is we're going to have to\n\n109\n00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.890\nprove that we're a human and not a robot.\n\n110\n00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.216\nAs you can see,\nI don't know what gave that away.\n\n111\n00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:40.530\nThey obviously don't want\nbots coming through here and\n\n112\n00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.730\ncreating phony accounts here,\nso we're gonna go ahead and\n\n113\n00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.250\nwe're gonna put a phone number in here and\nwe're gonna let it send us a text message.\n\n114\n00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.060\nNow, it could take a second to\nget that verification number.\n\n115\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.530\nIt's fairly fast, here, and I've\nalready got the verification number, so\n\n116\n00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.260\nlet's go ahead and\nplug that in and show you that.\n\n117\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.090\nSo once the number comes in,\nit's, like I said, fairly fast.\n\n118\n00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.980\nYou can plug that in here and\n\n119\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.970\nit's going to verify that hopefully\nyou're human and not a robot.\n\n120\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.760\nResistance is futile.\n\n121\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.790\nNow, this is some important information.\n\n122\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.250\nIt lets you know where you're\ngonna be logging into Office 365.\n\n123\n00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.810\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n124\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.590\nAnd then, also, what your username is.\n\n125\n00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.160\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and write that\ndown, just so I know that for my benefit.\n\n126\n00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:30.054\nAll right.\n\n127\n00:06:30.054 --> 00:06:36.015\nNow, notice that it's .onmicrosoft.com, so\nthat becomes what our tenant's name is.\n\n128\n00:06:36.015 --> 00:06:39.685\nITProTV002.onmicrosoft.com, and\n\n129\n00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:44.375\nwe can choose ready to go.\n\n130\n00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.460\nAll right.\n\n131\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.100\nNow, here is the Office 365 interface.\n\n132\n00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.780\nSo it looks like we're pretty close\nto being ready to go here but\n\n133\n00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.280\nwe just still have a couple\nthings that we have to do.\n\n134\n00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.070\nYou can see that it's still\nsetting up everything.\n\n135\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.200\nIt's basically going to now allocate\nthose resources to you in the cloud,\n\n136\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.320\ninto their infrastructure.\n\n137\n00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.540\nSo it's not ready to go right out of\nthe gate as they're still doing some\n\n138\n00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.900\nconfigurations, but what is ready to go\nthe moment you set up is this admin tile.\n\n139\n00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.570\nAnd that takes us the Office365\nadministration page\n\n140\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.300\nwhere we can configure.\n\n141\n00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.840\nWell, the first thing that we're gonna do,\nand you need to know this for\n\n142\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.350\nthe exam is setting up\nyour first administrator.\n\n143\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.450\nNow, to do it's fairly easy to provision.\n\n144\n00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.975\nWe're gonna go a couple different ways.\n\n145\n00:07:31.975 --> 00:07:36.763\nOver here on the upper right-hand side,\nyou can see add new users here.\n\n146\n00:07:36.763 --> 00:07:40.320\nWell, if I click that, which, use your\ndashboard, your dashboard's there.\n\n147\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.170\nIt's a handy feature.\n\n148\n00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.160\nIt's gonna turn around and\ntake you right back to user.\n\n149\n00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.800\nSo you can use that, that's just fine.\n\n150\n00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.320\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\njust switch over to the user so\n\n151\n00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.830\nwe can show you that section here too.\n\n152\n00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.335\nAnd you'll see that we have\nactive users and deleted users.\n\n153\n00:07:53.335 --> 00:07:58.114\nAnd we'll tell you a little bit in another\nepisode what the difference is between\n\n154\n00:07:58.114 --> 00:08:03.045\na soft delete and then finally deleting\nthose users completely from the database.\n\n155\n00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:05.260\nGotta be careful with that,\nand we'll show you that.\n\n156\n00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.100\nCouple different ways\nthat we can add users.\n\n157\n00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.839\nI'm gonna do it very basically here,\na single user, or\n\n158\n00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:13.200\nwe can do bulk user adds too.\n\n159\n00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.930\nWe're gonna do some bulk user adds with\nsome comma separated value files in\n\n160\n00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.000\nanother episode, so you'll have to\nstick around and check that out.\n\n161\n00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.670\nAll right, now what I'm doing here,\nour first user account,\n\n162\n00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.240\nthe one that I just created.\n\n163\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.250\nThat is the tenant administrator across\nall subscriptions and everything, but\n\n164\n00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.950\nI don't have an administrator yet,\nset up that I can say,\n\n165\n00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.020\nokay Dan, Dan's my senior engineer.\n\n166\n00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.180\nHe's gonna be the administrator for\nmy company, right?\n\n167\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.990\nWell, I need to be able to give\nhim access to this interface so\n\n168\n00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.630\nthat he can manage this interface for\nme once it's set up.\n\n169\n00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.080\nAnd that's essentially\nwhat we're doing here.\n\n170\n00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.070\nSo, first name,\nwe're just gonna call this user01,\n\n171\n00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.907\nand we'll leave it fairly simplistic here,\nhopefully for me [LAUGH].\n\n172\n00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.222\nAnd user01 again, let me take that capital\nout there, I'm a little OCD like that.\n\n173\n00:09:00.222 --> 00:09:01.082\n>> Who would name it like that?\n\n174\n00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.266\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n175\n00:09:02.266 --> 00:09:04.850\n[LAUGH] I called him user01.\n\n176\n00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.020\nYes, so\n\n177\n00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.990\nnow what we're doing here is you get\nthe ability to autogenerate a password.\n\n178\n00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.770\nThis is up to you, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.910\nIt depends on whatever your\npractice is in your company.\n\n180\n00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.710\nAutogenerate is probably one of the more\nsecure ways because it gives just a crazy\n\n181\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.470\ntemporary password.\n\n182\n00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.880\nBut if you have some kind of onboarding\nprocess, maybe onboarding documentation,\n\n183\n00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.000\nmaybe you wanna do like I'm gonna do right\nhere and I'm gonna type the password.\n\n184\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.529\nAnd then you could type whatever\nyour generic password is.\n\n185\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.700\nAnd this is gonna send an email out to\n\n186\n00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.980\nwhoever we decide that we\nwanna send this email to.\n\n187\n00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.710\nIn fact, I'm just gonna leave it as\nour tenant administrator here and\n\n188\n00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.080\nI'll send it to myself cuz we're\nnot really gonna log in with it.\n\n189\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.600\nBut notice that it says,\n\n190\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.480\nmake this person change their\npassword the next time they sign in.\n\n191\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.690\nI'm sure some of you that are watching\nhave maybe done this before.\n\n192\n00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.790\nMaybe inside of Active Directory, right?\n\n193\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.056\nWhere you create a user account, you know\nthe password, a little check mark that\n\n194\n00:10:02.056 --> 00:10:04.601\nsays they're gonna have to change\nit the next time they log in,\n\n195\n00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:05.870\nsame principle here, right?\n\n196\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.460\nAdministrators don't need username or\nusers' passwords, right?\n\n197\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.260\nWe can reset them.\n\n198\n00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.020\nSo it's not like we need to know this.\n\n199\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.017\nAll right, and we'll choose create.\n\n200\n00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:19.290\nAnd we have some success here.\n\n201\n00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.595\nThat's a great thing here.\n\n202\n00:10:20.595 --> 00:10:23.280\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and\nwe'll close this down.\n\n203\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.540\nAll right, now you can't really see it\nright now cuz I haven't selected it and\n\n204\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.620\nmy head's gonna be here in the way.\n\n205\n00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.310\nBut when I select user01,\nyou'll see down here in the bottom, it\n\n206\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.690\ngives me some options, and we'll look into\nthings like resetting the password later,\n\n207\n00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.500\nbut what I want is to\nedit user roles here.\n\n208\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.090\nAnd when I choose edit user roles,\nall right,\n\n209\n00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.070\nit's gonna ask me, do I wanna give\nthis person administrative access?\n\n210\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.370\nNotice that by default it says\nno administrative access.\n\n211\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.140\nAnd then I can make him\na global administrator and\n\n212\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.980\nthe fact that this is the very\nfirst administrator, right.\n\n213\n00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.630\nLike I was given the scenario,\nDan's the senior administrator here.\n\n214\n00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.630\nI need him to have full access to this.\n\n215\n00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.600\nI need him to be a global administrator,\nI just wanna show you we do have other\n\n216\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.050\nlimited administrative capabilities\nthat we can delegate to other people.\n\n217\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.330\nIn this case, I don't want a limitation,\nI want him to have access so I can say,\n\n218\n00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.830\nhey, I'm going on vacation, Dan.\n\n219\n00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.570\nYou take care of the IT infrastructure.\n\n220\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.400\n>> Yeah, Wes really quickly, what is the\ndifference between this administrator that\n\n221\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.030\nyou're creating right here, this role\nas an administrator, versus the tenant?\n\n222\n00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.290\n>> That's a great question.\n\n223\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.077\nNow tenants can sign up for more\nservices for your entire company, right.\n\n224\n00:11:31.077 --> 00:11:34.884\nThey can manage the Office\n365 subscription, okay.\n\n225\n00:11:34.884 --> 00:11:39.596\nThe global administrator has global\naccess over Office 365, right,\n\n226\n00:11:39.596 --> 00:11:43.624\nthey're not gonna be managing\nmy subscriptions if we say, for\n\n227\n00:11:43.624 --> 00:11:48.184\ninstance, we were talking about\nAzure yesterday off camera, right.\n\n228\n00:11:48.184 --> 00:11:51.125\nThe global administrator is not\ngonna sign up for Azure, that,\n\n229\n00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:53.802\nme as a tenant administrator,\nI have to make that choice.\n\n230\n00:11:53.802 --> 00:11:56.621\nDo I wanna spend the company's\nmoney on going to another cloud\n\n231\n00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:58.423\nbased product that Microsoft offers?\n\n232\n00:11:58.423 --> 00:12:02.210\nWell, that's gonna be a decision I make,\nright.\n\n233\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:07.170\nAs far as Office 365 goes,\nI wanna make Dan a global administrator,\n\n234\n00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.170\nor in this case, user01,\nnot that that's your name.\n\n235\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.090\nI wanna make user01 a global\nadministrator so he or\n\n236\n00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.940\nshe can administer to the Office\n365 admin console here.\n\n237\n00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.920\n>> Important extension.\n\n238\n00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.440\n>> That's right, absolutely,\nit's a great question.\n\n239\n00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.600\nSo let's go ahead and I'm gonna have to\nsave it to an alternative email, and I'm\n\n240\n00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.960\njust gonna go ahead and what we're gonna\ndo is just use my tenant administrator.\n\n241\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.460\nMake it easier here.\n\n242\n00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:37.451\nAnd definitely for my typing skills.\n\n243\n00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:42.590\nDot com.\n\n244\n00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.400\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose okay.\n\n245\n00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.180\nOh, and\nI probably configured something wrong, so\n\n246\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.040\nlet's just check that one more time.\n\n247\n00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.765\nEdit user role.\n\n248\n00:12:53.093 --> 00:12:54.962\nI'll tell you what.\n\n249\n00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:59.281\nWe can use another email address,\nlet's see.\n\n250\n00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:08.940\nAnd we'll try this here.\n\n251\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.270\nHopefully that will work\na little bit better.\n\n252\n00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:16.620\nAnd is it not giving that person,\nokay, no, it's saved.\n\n253\n00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.060\nSo when I come back in here and I edit it,\nI would have to figure out what that error\n\n254\n00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.070\nis, but it does let me know that when I\ncome back to the properties of the user,\n\n255\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.260\nnotice that the radio button's no longer\nstuck on user, no administrative access.\n\n256\n00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.320\nSo I would have to figure out\nwhat that error message is.\n\n257\n00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.790\nMaybe it doesn't like my email address,\nso we'll see.\n\n258\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.520\nBut it does look like\nthe global administrator role\n\n259\n00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.570\nhas been applied to this end user,\nuser01, which is what we need here.\n\n260\n00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.180\n>> All right, so now that we have\nan administrator set up, we've built them.\n\n261\n00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.410\nWe have that role in place,\nwhere do we go to next?\n\n262\n00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.310\n>> Okay, now one of the big things\nthat they'll call out on the exam\n\n263\n00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.470\nis determining your tenant location.\n\n264\n00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.210\nNow your tenant location is\nquite easy to figure out.\n\n265\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:58.390\nAnd one of the ways that you can set that\nis just by, I don't see Outlook yet.\n\n266\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.260\nI was hoping that Outlook\nwould be ready for us, but\n\n267\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.550\nit doesn't look like it's ready yet.\n\n268\n00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.400\nBut you can go in and you can set your\ntenant location inside of the Outlook,\n\n269\n00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.150\nOffice 365 but it looks like\nit's still being set up here.\n\n270\n00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.660\nSo might have to wait\na second on that one.\n\n271\n00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.030\nYeah, so the next thing that we're\ngonna have to do is setup our services.\n\n272\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.590\nAnd this is part of verifying your\ndomain and registering your domain.\n\n273\n00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.870\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n274\n00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.230\nNow we can do this from the dashboard,\nright?\n\n275\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.520\nWe have this little jumpling, and\nI know it's kinda hard to see that says,\n\n276\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.050\nset up your services.\n\n277\n00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.980\nBut you can also go the setting\nright under dashboard here.\n\n278\n00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.050\nAnd it's gonna take you\nto the same interface.\n\n279\n00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:38.298\nSo the dashboard's a nice feature there\nthat it'll take you to a lot of the common\n\n280\n00:14:38.298 --> 00:14:41.999\nlocations that you need to get up and\nrunning here with Office 365.\n\n281\n00:14:41.999 --> 00:14:45.790\nNow there's a few things that\nit wants to ask us to do here.\n\n282\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.370\nWe're gonna verify our domain,\nadd users, copy data, and\n\n283\n00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.600\nthen start our mail delivery.\n\n284\n00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.460\nSo let's go ahead and dive into that.\n\n285\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:56.440\nAnd it takes a second here as\nit gathers some information.\n\n286\n00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.370\nNow the first part of this\nwizard is about data migration.\n\n287\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.730\nAnd we're not gonna go into the data\nmigration cuz that's something more\n\n288\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.010\nleft for like an NCSA level.\n\n289\n00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.990\nAnd on the exam, they're not gonna be\nasking you, or the MTA cloud fundamentals,\n\n290\n00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.780\nthey're not gonna be asking you\nto perform data migrations.\n\n291\n00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.590\nIt's really not mentioned\nin the objectives here.\n\n292\n00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.614\nSo I'm gonna say no, we don't have\nany data to copy to Office 365.\n\n293\n00:15:18.614 --> 00:15:23.676\nIf you did, then obviously, this process\nis gonna take a little bit longer.\n\n294\n00:15:23.676 --> 00:15:28.210\nBut what we really wanna just see\nis the setting up of the domain.\n\n295\n00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.910\nNow, the next part here,\nwhen we talk about setting up the domain,\n\n296\n00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.140\nis adding what's known as a txt record,\ninside of DNS.\n\n297\n00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:41.460\nAnd what this is gonna allow Microsoft\nto do is connect to the domain service.\n\n298\n00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.168\nOr excuse me, the DNS server,\n\n299\n00:15:43.168 --> 00:15:47.590\nwhere our domain is being hosted to verify\nthat we are in control of that domain.\n\n300\n00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:52.669\nSo we'll go ahead and choose let's\n\n301\n00:15:52.669 --> 00:15:57.579\nget started, and I'm gonna put,\n\n302\n00:15:57.579 --> 00:16:02.670\nlet's see, spacerooster.net.\n\n303\n00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.342\nBecause that's a great domain name.\n\n304\n00:16:04.342 --> 00:16:05.050\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:05.926\n>> All right and\n\n306\n00:16:05.926 --> 00:16:09.827\none of the things it's gonna do,\nit's gonna reach out and\n\n307\n00:16:09.827 --> 00:16:13.568\nit's gonna try to do a DNS\nlookup against this domain and\n\n308\n00:16:13.568 --> 00:16:17.000\nit's gonna ask us,\ndo you really own that domain?\n\n309\n00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.460\nAnd it can tell right now that it says,\nhey, GoDaddy's in charge of that domain.\n\n310\n00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.460\nWhat you need to do is you need to take\nthese values and you need to copy them\n\n311\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:30.480\ninto the domain records,\nthe DNS zone file within your domain.\n\n312\n00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.420\nNow this could take a bit as far as\ngetting the domain registered as part of\n\n313\n00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.630\nDNS.\n\n314\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:41.460\nKeep in mind that they say 48\nhours on your provider side.\n\n315\n00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.430\nThey say, they could typically\nfind it within a minute but\n\n316\n00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.620\nsometimes it can take up to two hours.\n\n317\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.930\nSo, I've actually got a machine\nready that is in some,\n\n318\n00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:55.330\nis in the same location that I know\nthat the TXT records are already there.\n\n319\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.640\nLet me go ahead and show you that.\n\n320\n00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.050\nSo same domain for me here.\n\n321\n00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:05.740\nIf I go down to,\nwell if I log in first that always helps.\n\n322\n00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:12.978\nThen if I scroll down to where my\nzone file is you'll see that we have,\n\n323\n00:17:12.978 --> 00:17:17.740\nwell I don't have a TXT record here, and\nthis is where I would add that record.\n\n324\n00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.300\nSo I can choose Add Record, and\ntypically what they want is they want you,\n\n325\n00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.290\nyour host is gonna be the @ symbol,\nand then it's gonna be ms=, right,\n\n326\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.650\nand there's gonna be\ntypically a numerical value.\n\n327\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:37.830\nI've seen some of them like 2016,\nand then 9541.\n\n328\n00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.320\nSo, I've already got this done.\n\n329\n00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.510\nThis is where you enter that record.\n\n330\n00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:46.520\nAnd then the next thing you do is you\nwill click go on that and click next.\n\n331\n00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.852\nSo, let me go ahead and log into that one.\n\n332\n00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:54.971\nI wanna make sure I\nremember that name there.\n\n333\n00:17:58.709 --> 00:18:01.796\nCuz you can never have too many log ons,\nright?\n\n334\n00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:07.662\n>> That's actually not a true statement.\n\n335\n00:18:07.662 --> 00:18:09.660\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's true.\n\n336\n00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.210\nThere are a bunch.\n\n337\n00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.134\nRight?\n>> That's right.\n\n338\n00:18:24.259 --> 00:18:25.583\n>> Well, how about this.\n\n339\n00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:33.570\nHow about I actually type\nthe right name and here we go.\n\n340\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.560\nSo it's telling me the same setup.\n\n341\n00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.290\nIt's saying, hey, no I don't wanna\ncopy anything up to Office 365.\n\n342\n00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:43.290\nSo it could take a little bit for\n\n343\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.580\nthe interface to get connected and\nget started up.\n\n344\n00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.320\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n345\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.490\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna put in that domain.\n\n346\n00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.400\nAnd I used a slightly different one for\nthis one here.\n\n347\n00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.570\nAnd make sure I couldn't remember if\nit was the .us or nope that's not it.\n\n348\n00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:08.850\nSo let me go back here and\nchange that to .us, there we go.\n\n349\n00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.350\nWe got a couple of domain names here, just\nto make sure that we have what we need.\n\n350\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.980\nAnd it takes a second to notice that\nit says, it verifies, that hey yes,\n\n351\n00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.550\nyou do own this domain.\n\n352\n00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.790\nLike I said, same process.\n\n353\n00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:22.980\nProcess is no different.\n\n354\n00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.180\nUpdating those TXT records.\n\n355\n00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.840\nAnd now it's gonna ask us\nto go through this again.\n\n356\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.650\nNow what we need to do is we need to\nfigure out do we wanna change the name\n\n357\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:39.440\nspace here from on Microsoft.com\nto well Jimmy@spacerooster.us.\n\n358\n00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.570\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nleave that, leave it where it is.\n\n359\n00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.030\nI'm gonna go ahead and skip that for now.\n\n360\n00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.490\nAll right, we verified.\n\n361\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.910\nNow, we can also add new users if we want.\n\n362\n00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.810\nNow, we're gonna show you exactly how to\nadd individual users in another episode.\n\n363\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.680\nSo, I'm gonna skip it here cuz we've\nalready showed you how to add a single\n\n364\n00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.290\nuser, right, and\nturn it into a global administrator.\n\n365\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.790\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nwe will skip this step for\n\n366\n00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.920\nnow cuz I really wanna show\nyou guys some bulk add here.\n\n367\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:15.180\nAll right and now because we're on the E5\nsubscription, I do have the option that\n\n368\n00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.720\nif I wanna download and install Office\ncompletely to this computer I can.\n\n369\n00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.110\nWe're not gonna do that and\ntake a lot of time there.\n\n370\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:27.070\nSo we could do that In\nanother series here.\n\n371\n00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.760\nWe'll choose next.\n\n372\n00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.580\nNow here's the point where we\nhave to figure out DNS records.\n\n373\n00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:38.185\nDo I want Microsoft to manage my\n\n374\n00:20:38.185 --> 00:20:43.945\nDNS records or\ndo I want to manage them myself?\n\n375\n00:20:43.945 --> 00:20:47.715\nAnd I'm gonna say for instance, just for\nnow, no I have an existing website or\n\n376\n00:20:47.715 --> 00:20:49.395\nprefer to manage my own DNS.\n\n377\n00:20:49.395 --> 00:20:54.115\nAnd that's important on the exam\nbecause they want you to know what\n\n378\n00:20:54.115 --> 00:20:57.999\nare the DNS record types that you would\nneed if you were gonna support this.\n\n379\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.450\nSo we'll choose Next.\n\n380\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:01.800\nAnd then what it's gonna do,\n\n381\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.690\nnow this is what's known as\nthe domain purpose, all right?\n\n382\n00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:09.390\nAnd this is what really sets the stage for\nthe services that we're going to enter\n\n383\n00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:14.900\ninto and you really have to\nknow what services you want.\n\n384\n00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.820\nWe'll just keep the defaults and\nwe're gonna choose Next.\n\n385\n00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:24.600\nAnd here are all the different\nrecords that you would have to add.\n\n386\n00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.240\nNow I don't believe that\nthey're gonna call you out on\n\n387\n00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.795\neach individual specific record, but\nthe type of record is what they call out.\n\n388\n00:21:31.795 --> 00:21:35.763\nYou'll see that you have to have\nyour mail exchanger records, right?\n\n389\n00:21:35.763 --> 00:21:36.395\nMX records.\n\n390\n00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:39.155\nYour canonical names or alias records.\n\n391\n00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:40.885\nThat txt record.\n\n392\n00:21:40.885 --> 00:21:45.815\nAnd you have some SRV, or service locator\nrecords here that you need to use.\n\n393\n00:21:45.815 --> 00:21:49.805\nAnd what I'm gonna do is, they don't\nreally call out adding these in, so\n\n394\n00:21:49.805 --> 00:21:51.250\nI'm gonna go ahead and choose back.\n\n395\n00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.110\nAnd I'm gonna choose back one more\ntime and I'm gonna let them manage it.\n\n396\n00:21:55.110 --> 00:22:00.570\nSo I'm gonna say, yes I want to transfer\nDNS management in the next step.\n\n397\n00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.270\nWe'll choose next, and\n\n398\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.690\nnow what it's gonna do is it's gonna say\nthere's a another type of record, right?\n\n399\n00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.980\nThere's another type of record\nthat you need to add, and\n\n400\n00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.560\nthese are the name server records.\n\n401\n00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.190\nAnd Dan, what I think is interesting\non this is they've actually contacted,\n\n402\n00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.520\nmine's hosted by GoDaddy,\nthey've actually contacted GoDaddy and\n\n403\n00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.650\nthey can say your current nameservers,\nwe already know what they are.\n\n404\n00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.480\nWe queried DNS and this is what we found.\n\n405\n00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.790\nBut this is what it needs to be.\n\n406\n00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:30.440\nSo we need to take these records,\nthese name server records and\n\n407\n00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.800\nI'll go ahead and copy these.\n\n408\n00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:36.800\nAnd what you have to do, this is a little\nbit different and the interface is,\n\n409\n00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.380\nI'm using GoDaddy, it's gonna be up\nto whatever interface you're using.\n\n410\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.930\nFor me I have to change this because\nthese are internally managed by GoDaddy.\n\n411\n00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.020\nWhat I'm saying is, no GoDaddy I\ndon't want you to manage it anymore.\n\n412\n00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.760\nWhat I want is Microsoft to manage it.\n\n413\n00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.430\nSo what I'm going to do here is,\n\n414\n00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.700\nI'm going to do custom and\nI'm going to add a name server.\n\n415\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.940\nAnd it's going to make\nme add two by default.\n\n416\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.205\nDan got any idea of why I might\nwant to add two name servers?\n\n417\n00:23:03.205 --> 00:23:06.165\n>> Maybe in case one goes down,\nthere might be a backup.\n\n418\n00:23:06.165 --> 00:23:09.825\n>> You got it, that was almost too easy,\nright, yeah, absolutely.\n\n419\n00:23:09.825 --> 00:23:11.085\nAnd he's exactly right.\n\n420\n00:23:11.085 --> 00:23:11.805\nThat's why we want it.\n\n421\n00:23:11.805 --> 00:23:15.765\nWe want redundancy cuz remember,\nDNS is important for finding any website.\n\n422\n00:23:15.765 --> 00:23:20.510\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nchoose Okay and then choose Save.\n\n423\n00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:25.030\nNow, like I said, the specific steps that\nyou have here could take a little while.\n\n424\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:30.950\nIn fact, this could take\nup to 48 hours to complete.\n\n425\n00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.275\nHopefully, we're gonna cross our fingers\nand hopefully it doesn't take that long.\n\n426\n00:23:35.275 --> 00:23:39.455\nHopefully they turn around and they find\nit, and they say oh yeah, we verified.\n\n427\n00:23:39.455 --> 00:23:41.465\nAnd you might notice\nthat it's going to try.\n\n428\n00:23:41.465 --> 00:23:42.995\nAnd it did it, look at that.\n\n429\n00:23:42.995 --> 00:23:45.305\nNow I've had it a couple of\ntimes where it comes back and\n\n430\n00:23:45.305 --> 00:23:47.455\nit gives us the same exact answer.\n\n431\n00:23:47.455 --> 00:23:51.605\nIt says we've contacted your DNS server,\nand we couldn't verify it.\n\n432\n00:23:51.605 --> 00:23:53.250\nIt gives you this red X.\n\n433\n00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.090\nGuys, that's just the DNS System\ntaking a little bit to propagate.\n\n434\n00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.370\nThere's nothing you can do on your end,\nnor can Microsoft,\n\n435\n00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.520\nby that matter, that you guys\ncan do to speed up that process.\n\n436\n00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.940\nAll right, so when it comes down to\nit now, we'll say you're all set up.\n\n437\n00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:09.750\nRate your experience.\n\n438\n00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.030\nWhat do you say?\n\n439\n00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:11.970\n>> I'd give it five stars.\n\n440\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.420\nThat was pretty simple,\npretty straightforward.\n\n441\n00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.480\n>> It was pretty simple.\n\n442\n00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.340\nThey didn't do too bad.\n\n443\n00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.620\nGets a little more complex if you\nhave to add your own records in.\n\n444\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.580\nWhat we've shown you is the records\nthat you need to know for the exam.\n\n445\n00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.050\nRemember MX records,\ncanonical or C name records.\n\n446\n00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:28.620\nHave to know the SRV records and\nthe TXT records, and\n\n447\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.130\nin this case they pull out another\nrecord that I want you to know.\n\n448\n00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.330\nThat's the NS record,\nwhich is a name server record.\n\n449\n00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.630\nIt just means in my DNS zone,\nput the name server for Microsoft.\n\n450\n00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:43.130\nSo when you come to my DNS server for\nspacerooster.us, I'm gonna turn around and\n\n451\n00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:44.260\nredirect you to Microsoft.\n\n452\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.260\nRemember, software is a service.\n\n453\n00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.400\nLet them manage it for you.\n\n454\n00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.690\n>> It's all about passing the buck today.\n\n455\n00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:49.345\n>> That's right.\n\n456\n00:24:49.345 --> 00:24:50.240\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n457\n00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.640\n>> Let somebody else take care of that.\n\n458\n00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.190\nI don't want to do it.\n\n459\n00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.840\nI gotta watch IT Pro TV next.\n\n460\n00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.090\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n461\n00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:55.640\n>> All right, Wes,\n\n462\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.140\nis there anything else we need to\ncover before we close the show today?\n\n463\n00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.150\n>> No, just pay attention,\nyou know pay attention to step by steps.\n\n464\n00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.000\nThere's a lot of good information there.\n\n465\n00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.600\nThere's a lot of built in information\nas you're going through this process.\n\n466\n00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.010\nIf any of this gets confusing, or\nmaybe you're just tuning in to this and\n\n467\n00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.910\nyou don't know what those records are, or\nmaybe you don't even know what some of\n\n468\n00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.410\nthe concepts are, go back and watch these\nepisodes and definitely part one and\n\n469\n00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.182\npart two of this and you should be good.\n\n470\n00:25:19.182 --> 00:25:22.850\n>> All right, well thank you so much Wes\nfor walking us down this little path of\n\n471\n00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.280\nsetting up our Office 365\nwith our own custom domains.\n\n472\n00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.000\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and close the show.\n\n473\n00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.400\nThank you for watching and\nsigning off for IT Pro TV,\n\n474\n00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.190\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n475\n00:25:32.190 -->

another great\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.490\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery,\nand in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.530\nwe're continuing on our\nMTA Cloud fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.220\nJoining me in the studio again today\nis none other than our good friend,\n\n7\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.080\nyou know him, you love him, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.570\nWes, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.600\nHow the heck are you today, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.160\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.060\nThanks for having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.260\nThat's right,\nwe are moving through part four.\n\n13\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.300\nYes, that's right,\nthe episode that never ends.\n\n14\n00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.070\nPart four of enabling cloud services and\n\n15\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.960\nin the first few parts of this episode\nhere, we've talked about Office 365.\n\n16\n00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.230\nNaming your tenant,\nhow to get Office 365 up and running.\n\n17\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.100\nNow one of the things that\nthe also call out on the MTA\n\n18\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.600\ncloud fundamentals exam is knowing\na little bit about Microsoft Intune.\n\n19\n00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.450\nSo we wouldn't be doing you any justice\nif we didn't at least show you some of\n\n20\n00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.960\nwhat you can expect to see about Windows\nIntune or Microsoft Intune as it's called.\n\n21\n00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.220\nIt's got had a little name change\nover the last couple of years.\n\n22\n00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.820\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in and\n\n23\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.158\nshow you how you can set\nthat up with your company.\n\n24\n00:01:06.158 --> 00:01:09.500\nNow your gonna notice there,\nDan you might even notice this,\n\n25\n00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.840\nwhen we set up our Office 365 tenant,\nright?\n\n26\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.670\nIt's almost the same identical interface.\n\n27\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.130\nSo If you're just setting\nup Microsoft Intune you're\n\n28\n00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.880\ngonna know how to do that right away,\nbecause if you\n\n29\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.320\nreview some of the earlier parts within\nthis episode you're gonna see that.\n\n30\n00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.770\nBut one of the great things that you\ncan do, cloud-based services right?\n\n31\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.090\nThis is the platform that allows\nyou to integrate it right into\n\n32\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.640\nOffice 365 if you've already\ngot an existing subscription.\n\n33\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.430\nSo, if you haven't seen\nhow to enable your tenant,\n\n34\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.200\ndetermine tenant location for\nOffice 365, go back and\n\n35\n00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.940\nwatch the first part of this episode,\nbecause it´ll be identical.\n\n36\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.500\nHowever, what we wanna show you is how to\ntake Microsoft Intune and go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.780\nintegrate it with an already\nexisting Office 365 account and\n\n38\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.980\nthe good thing is they give\nus this option right here.\n\n39\n00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.620\nDo you want to add it to\nan existing subscription?\n\n40\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.270\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose to sign in here.\n\n41\n00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.100\nAnd hopefully we will be able to.\n\n42\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.750\nAll right, so let me go ahead and\nget signed in.\n\n43\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.320\nIf I can remember that Tenant name there.\n\n44\n00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.818\nAnd, we'll use our super\nsecret password here.\n\n45\n00:02:31.154 --> 00:02:34.390\nAnd let me try to type that\npassword one more time.\n\n46\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.310\nPasswords can be challenging, right?\n\n47\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.996\n>> If you type the wrong one, it usually\ndoesn't let you log in very well.\n\n48\n00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:43.020\n>> [LAUGH] And there we go, and notice\nthat right now, right away it says, hey,\n\n49\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.770\ndo you wanna confirm your order?\n\n50\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.730\nNow I logged in, even though it\nstarted us out in the Office 365, or\n\n51\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.960\nexcuse me, the Microsoft Intune interface,\none of the things that I want you\n\n52\n00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.030\nto notice is right here at the top, oops,\nnotice that Office 365 is right there.\n\n53\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.910\nSo what we're doing is confirming\nthat yes we do wanna go ahead and\n\n54\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.260\nstart a subscription, trial\nsubscription of Microsoft In Tune, and\n\n55\n00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.850\nwe're gonna go ahead and just integrate\nthat with our existing technology.\n\n56\n00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.900\nNow they give you a confirmation number,\nthis is gonna be your temporary license.\n\n57\n00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.720\nSo you're gonna wanna go ahead,\nthey give you the ability to print this,\n\n58\n00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.420\nyeah there we go,\na little print icon if you wanna print it.\n\n59\n00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.770\nYou should save your license\ninformation just so if you decide,\n\n60\n00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.470\nhey I think I want to go with\na paid subscription after my trial,\n\n61\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.510\nyou can have that information\nready to go for you.\n\n62\n00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.260\nSo we'll go ahead and\nchoose continue here.\n\n63\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.710\nNow one of the great things here is when\nyou do integrate your Office 365 here,\n\n64\n00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.140\nyou should see and it takes a little bit\nto integrate, it's actually merging.\n\n65\n00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.980\nThe two consoles right\nnow they are merging.\n\n66\n00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.700\nIf you've got an Office 365 subscription,\n\n67\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.800\nthey really don't want you to\nhave the two of these interfaces.\n\n68\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.130\nThey want you to use it all\nthrough a single interface.\n\n69\n00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.310\nIf you don't have Office 365,\n\n70\n00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.560\nthey really want you to integrate\nyour Microsoft Intune into SCCM,\n\n71\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.430\nthe System Center Configuration Manager\nand that's what you're gonna see here.\n\n72\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.400\nSo if I go back to now the account portal,\nit hasn't merged yet, so\n\n73\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.290\nyou still have two interfaces\nthat you gotta go to.\n\n74\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.920\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n75\n00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.920\nAnd there are two different locations.\n\n76\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.800\nThe first one we want to type in our\nsearch engine is just to type out\n\n77\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.290\nMicrosoft Intune and then account portal.\n\n78\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.090\nAll right, so the account portal is where\nthe global administrator's gonna log in\n\n79\n00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.440\nand imagine this, manage the accounts.\n\n80\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.990\nSo now that we're logged in to\nthe Microsoft Intune platform,\n\n81\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.860\nwhat we can do is we can set\nup our first administrator.\n\n82\n00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.160\nNow the process is really close\nto the same that we've seen in\n\n83\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.120\nOffice 365 when we set up our\nfirst administrator there.\n\n84\n00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.000\nYou're gonna go over to the left-hand\nside here and you're gonna choose Users.\n\n85\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.130\nAnd one of things that's interesting is,\nI haven't set a single user up yet and\n\n86\n00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.950\nI've got these users that\nready to go already in Intune.\n\n87\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.180\nThat's what's called\na synchronized identity.\n\n88\n00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.670\nSince I've already got\nthem there in Office 365,\n\n89\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:12.380\nthe moment I attached the Microsoft In\nTune subscription to Office 365 it imports\n\n90\n00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.550\nto Azure in the background and goes ahead\nand import those identities for me.\n\n91\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.440\nSo they're ready to go and\n\n92\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.630\nI don't have to choose two different\nlocations to create my user's here.\n\n93\n00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.270\nNow, it's really easy,\n\n94\n00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.440\nwhen you wanna set up your administrator\ninside the Microsoft In Tune platform,\n\n95\n00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.260\nall you have to do is select\nthe user's themselves.\n\n96\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.080\nAnd you just choose edit.\n\n97\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.730\nNow, once you choose edit, it doesn't\nlook like there's a lot to do here, but\n\n98\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.520\nwe can go to settings.\n\n99\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.360\nAnd you're going to notice,\nand Dan you probably remember,\n\n100\n00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.530\nwe're seeing almost the same set up for\nOffice 365, right?\n\n101\n00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.640\nYou get the option to choose\na global administrator, and\n\n102\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.680\nthe different various administrators here.\n\n103\n00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.370\nYou gotta be careful when you're setting\nthis up for the first time because you\n\n104\n00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.240\ncould run into a little bit of\na data loss on that computer, or\n\n105\n00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.410\non that user if they happen to be\nattached to the other platform.\n\n106\n00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.040\nSo if I set this to\nglobal administrator and\n\n107\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.700\nchange User01 into global administrator,\nit talks about the license assignment.\n\n108\n00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.290\nYou gotta be careful\nwith your license here.\n\n109\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.940\nWe've got plenty of licenses, so\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n110\n00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.560\n>> So Wes really quickly, just because\nyou might be a global administrator\n\n111\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.300\nin Office 365 doesn't necessarily mean\nyou're a global administrator in Intune.\n\n112\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.880\n>> That is an excellent question.\n\n113\n00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.430\nThe answer to that is no.\n\n114\n00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.100\nif you're a global\nadministrator in Office 365,\n\n115\n00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.210\nyou are not a global administrator\ninside of Microsoft Intune.\n\n116\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.500\nYou had a great question in the first part\nof this episode here where you had asked\n\n117\n00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.620\nabout as far as, what is the difference\nbetween the tenant administrator and\n\n118\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.870\nthe global administrator.\n\n119\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.690\nThe global administrator is specific\nto the platform that they're managing.\n\n120\n00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.120\nMe or myself,\nas a tentative administrator,\n\n121\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.680\nI can control across both of\nthese platforms and obviously,\n\n122\n00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.840\nI don't have any permissions issues,\nso top of the stack on that one is\n\n123\n00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.014\nthe tentative administrator\nacross all your cloud services.\n\n124\n00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:05.460\nNow and that's simple, when you need to\nset up your global administrator inside of\n\n125\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.850\nMicrosoft Intune you will, you really\nwon´t have too much of a problem here.\n\n126\n00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.660\nNow one of the things that they also want\nyou to know about the Microsoft Intune,\n\n127\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.100\nplatform is calling out those DNS records.\n\n128\n00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.130\nWhat are the DNS records that\nsupport this infrastructure?\n\n129\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.640\nWell the great thing is because this\nis using Azure Active Directory in\n\n130\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.230\nthe background which is connected\nto the Office 365 platform,\n\n131\n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.880\nthe ports are the same.\n\n132\n00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.500\nThat's a great thing.\n\n133\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.300\nIf you've set up in Office 365,\nyour managed DNS or\n\n134\n00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.260\nMicrosoft is managing DNS through setting\nup the NS records in whatever your\n\n135\n00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.930\nhosting domain is then You're already\nready to go here in Microsoft Intuit,\n\n136\n00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.700\nand you don't have to set it again.\n\n137\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.840\nSo this is one of the great\nthings that we talk about and\n\n138\n00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.890\nhave talked about in this series,\nwhen it comes to software as a service,\n\n139\n00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:02.360\nwe're setting up DNS on one side and then\nit's good for all of the cloud services.\n\n140\n00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.250\nSo I do want to make mention of that too\n\n141\n00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.520\nbecause you can find that information\nout on Tech Net and Azure's website.\n\n142\n00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.180\nThat when you're setting up your active\ndirectory infrastructure in Azure,\n\n143\n00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.690\nyou'll get about halfway\ndown that page and\n\n144\n00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:20.560\nit'll say if you're using Microsoft's\nIntune, you don't need to worry about DNS.\n\n145\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.950\nBecause it's gonna use the same DNS\ninfrastructure as your entire platform is.\n\n146\n00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.430\nSo makes it a lot easier to get set up and\nrunning.\n\n147\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.180\nAnd again, for the most part,\nwe don't really have\n\n148\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.660\ntoo much problem here when it comes\nto getting our infrastructure up.\n\n149\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.370\nNow to go a little bit farther on this,\nnotice that I have just a single user\n\n150\n00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.660\nhere, I might wanna\ncreate a security group.\n\n151\n00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.210\nRemember role based administration\nis something that you're gonna wanna\n\n152\n00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.490\nperform in this.\n\n153\n00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.310\nAnd I might want to say, for instance,\ncreate a new group real quick.\n\n154\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.610\nBut we're gonna do more of this when we\nget into some of the later episodes here.\n\n155\n00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:59.860\nBut I might want to have, let's say for\ninstance, ITProTV Admin Group right?\n\n156\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.105\nIt´s a good idea to do role based\nadministration so, now that I know that\n\n157\n00:09:04.105 --> 00:09:07.680\nUser01 is an administrator,\nwell what happens if somebody,\n\n158\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.540\nanother administrator comes in here and\nhas to deal with this.\n\n159\n00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.330\nAnd has to look at our infrastructure.\n\n160\n00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.160\nFrom this list,\n\n161\n00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.720\nuser list by themselves, they can´t really\ntell which ones the administrator, so\n\n162\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.630\nif I just select the user here, choose\nadd, you'll see them on this side here.\n\n163\n00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.760\nI choose save and close.\n\n164\n00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.350\nNow it's a little bit different.\n\n165\n00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.990\nNow I've got my security groups here and\n\n166\n00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.230\nI can put a staff security group and\nlike I said, we're gonna go into that\n\n167\n00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.720\na little bit more in another episode on\ncreating and managing users and groups,\n\n168\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.090\nbut it is a good thing and\nyou really wanna do this ahead of time.\n\n169\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.340\nAt least for that first administrator so\nthat it's easy to identify and\n\n170\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.750\nit eases the burden of administration,\nespecially if you're gonna assign\n\n171\n00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.090\nadditional administrators and they're\ngonna jump right into the platform.\n\n172\n00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.780\nThey can look in here and\nsee some kind of logical\n\n173\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.890\nstructure to the way that you're\ngonna set up your infrastructure.\n\n174\n00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.520\nIt'll be up to you, but\nit is a best practice there Dan.\n\n175\n00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.160\n>> Awesome.\nI really the fact that because it's all\n\n176\n00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.420\nbuilt on Microsoft cloud\nplatforms that if you have a lot,\n\n177\n00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.300\nif you've done all the leg work for\none a lot of the leg work for\n\n178\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.940\nthe other platforms are kinda done for\nyou as well.\n\n179\n00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.550\nThat was a.\n\n180\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.390\nThat was a really smart\nmove on their part.\n\n181\n00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.220\nWes, is there anything else about Intune,\nand establishing a connection with that?\n\n182\n00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.900\n>> You know, that right there,\nit's as simplistic as that.\n\n183\n00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.390\nWe definitely need to be aware of that for\nthe MTA cloud fundamentals.\n\n184\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.980\nAnd we're gonna have more in\ntune coming up in some of\n\n185\n00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.660\nthe configurations that you can do.\n\n186\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.590\nBut as far as naming your tenant,\nsetting tenant location,\n\n187\n00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.910\none of the great things is it\nis no different than Office 365.\n\n188\n00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.050\nAnd it's even easier if you already have\nan Office 365 account because then you can\n\n189\n00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.920\ndo what we just did there,\nyou merge the two platforms together.\n\n190\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.030\nAnd I will give you a heads up for the\nfuture, in fact I don't have the alert.\n\n191\n00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.980\nI think if I go to the admin console,\nI can show you this alert here real quick.\n\n192\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.280\nOh, it's gonna make me log back in.\n\n193\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.300\nThey're letting you know, and I don't see\nthe security alerts there, they're letting\n\n194\n00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.990\nyou know that the Office 365 and the\nMicrosoft Intune platform here very soon,\n\n195\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.470\nin fact they're in the process of\nmerging it right now as we speak.\n\n196\n00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.460\nSo here in a, you know, I don't know\nthe timeline here, but let's say,\n\n197\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.750\na couple months, you're not going\nto see two different platforms.\n\n198\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.120\nYou're going to see it kinda\nlike in Office 365 over here.\n\n199\n00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.860\nDown here where we've got Exchange,\nSkype for Business and\n\n200\n00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.400\nsome of the other services that we're\ngonna see here Azure AD and then Bing.\n\n201\n00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.010\nThen it'll be in the list too.\n\n202\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.340\nI will tell you that if you\nthat if you setup a stand-alone\n\n203\n00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.170\nMicrosoft Intune account, the services\nthat you'll see here on the side,\n\n204\n00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.080\nwithout Office 365 being involved,\nis gonna be Azure AD.\n\n205\n00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.370\nAnd you will see an Intune location there,\nand that's what you're gonna see within\n\n206\n00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.240\na couple of months, even if you\nalready have an existing Office 365.\n\n207\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.350\nBlending of the two platforms\nmakes it a lot more simplistic,\n\n208\n00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.080\nsingle interface, and\nthat's what they're really striving for,\n\n209\n00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.350\nis that unified interface\nacross multiple platforms.\n\n210\n00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:55.210\n>> Excellent stuff Wes.\n\n211\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.500\nThank you so much for\nshowing us what we can do.\n\n212\n00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.360\nHow we can get Intune working cuz\nthat is something they do call out\n\n213\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.380\nas an exam objective.\n\n214\n00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.340\nSo we wanted to make sure you guys\nwere up on and aware of that.\n\n215\n00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.450\nIt is a short and sweet episode,\nbut it was a good one.\n\n216\n00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:08.540\nDefinitely necessary.\n\n217\n00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.890\nThanks for joining us Wes and\nthank you for watching.\n\n218\n00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.770\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n219\n00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.220\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n220\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:14.930\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n221\n00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.231\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n222\n00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:22.129\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.970\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.980\nin today's episode we are continuing on\nwith out MTA cloud fundamentals series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.110\nAnd joining me yet again is the man, the\nmyth, the legend, that is my good friend,\n\n6\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.940\nWes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.660\nWes, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.570\nGlad to have you back.\n\n9\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.320\nHow the heck are you?\n\n10\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.620\nOh, I'm doing good, and\nit's good to be here, as always.\n\n11\n00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.170\nAnd we're gonna be moving into\nadministering cloud services.\n\n12\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.970\nAnd one of the first things you have\nto know when it comes to any kind of\n\n13\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.970\ncloud service is a little\nbit about the identities and\n\n14\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.000\nthe accounts that you can create.\n\n15\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.100\nNow, Let's understand what an identity is,\n\n16\n00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.360\nbecause it does mean a couple different\nthings across the different platforms.\n\n17\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.360\nIdentities for us in Office 365 and\n\n18\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.670\nthe Microsoft Intune really boils down to\ntwo different types of identities, right?\n\n19\n00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.150\nIt's either going to be a user or\nit's going to be a computer.\n\n20\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.730\nNow if you're in Active Directory you can\nalso have things like services can be\n\n21\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.160\nidentified as like an identity if you\nneed to set up an account for that but\n\n22\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.130\nwhat we're really looking at here is\nusers and computers, or even groups.\n\n23\n00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.270\nI gotta include the groups there, too.\n\n24\n00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.970\nUsers, groups, and computers.\n\n25\n00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.770\nNow there are some different types of\nidentities when it comes to users,\n\n26\n00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.350\ngroups, or computers.\n\n27\n00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.780\nOne of the first ones we have is what\nis known as the online identity.\n\n28\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.810\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n29\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.310\nOnline identities are ones that,\nimagine this.\n\n30\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.610\nYou create them online.\n\n31\n00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.970\nWe've got the Office\n365 platform here open.\n\n32\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.980\nAnd you can see I have a couple\nof identities ready to go.\n\n33\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.860\nNow these are ones that were\ncreated in the cloud, right.\n\n34\n00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.430\nSoftware as a service is one of\nthe things that we've really been focused\n\n35\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.180\non more than anything out of\nthe cloud computing stack.\n\n36\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.120\nWell, I created these right here right,\nI didn't create these on premise,\n\n37\n00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.850\non a server and\n\n38\n00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.800\nthen, have them synchronized up to the\ncloud, they started here in the cloud and\n\n39\n00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.890\nfor the most part of staying here in\nthe cloud and that's an online identity.\n\n40\n00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.380\nThe other type of identity we have is\nwhat's known as a synchronized identity.\n\n41\n00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.750\nSynchronized identities, you can\ntypically see here in your Azure AD.\n\n42\n00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.010\nSynchronized identities, right?\n\n43\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.900\nWhen we talk about a synchronization, we\ncan have them synchronize from on premise,\n\n44\n00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.660\nup to the cloud, right,\n\n45\n00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.610\nbecause you might have an existing Active\nDirectory infrastructure in place, and\n\n46\n00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.410\nyou're considering moving\nto software as a service.\n\n47\n00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.300\nWell those identities that\nare already on premise\n\n48\n00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.980\nneed to make it up to the cloud, right?\n\n49\n00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.600\nSo what you do,\nyou connect your Active Directory\n\n50\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.820\nto the cloud through an Active Directory\nsynchronization process and\n\n51\n00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.170\nall those identities get\nmoved up into the cloud.\n\n52\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.020\nNow what does that do for\nthe on premise IDs?\n\n53\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.010\nWell, nothing.\n\n54\n00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.240\nThey're still there as well but\n\n55\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.350\nnow you get the ability to use\nexisting infrastructure or\n\n56\n00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.160\nexisting identities that you already have\non premise and synchronize them across\n\n57\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.910\nall of the web platforms and\nthe cloud platforms that we have.\n\n58\n00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.900\n>> Yeah, Wes,\nwhen you synchronize identities,\n\n59\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.740\nI always think of the spies on a TV\nshows or the black ops guys and\n\n60\n00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.090\nthey're gonna go in and\ndo some sort of mission.\n\n61\n00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.700\nAnd what do they do?\n\n62\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.340\nThey say, let's synchronize watches and\nwhat does that mean?\n\n63\n00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.460\nIt means let's make all of our\nwatches on the exact same time, so\n\n64\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.980\nthat when I'm ready to make a move,\nyou're ready to make a move.\n\n65\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.970\nIt's the same idea when it comes\nto synchronized identities.\n\n66\n00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.750\nYou have some on premise identities,\nand now we want\n\n67\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.695\nto have our cloud services be able to work\nwith those together at the same time,\n\n68\n00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:25.475\nno matter where you go those\nusers are there, right Wes?\n\n69\n00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:26.185\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n70\n00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:29.335\nYou know what's funny, is it kinda reminds\nme of a bad 80s reference here, right?\n\n71\n00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:30.505\nThe synchronized Swatch watches?\n\n72\n00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:32.115\nYou remember the Swatch watch commercials-\n>> Oh yes, I do.\n\n73\n00:03:32.115 --> 00:03:34.755\n>> Where they'd all put their watches out\nand that's all you'd see is the hands, and\n\n74\n00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:38.390\nthe synchronize Swatches, right,\nIs all about time synchronization.\n\n75\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.740\nAnd this isn't about time synchronization,\nthis is more like Dan said,\n\n76\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.760\nthat we need that synchronization\nacross multiple platforms here.\n\n77\n00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.080\nNow, the other type of identity we have\nis what is called a federated identity.\n\n78\n00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.860\nNow, we're not talking about\nthe federation coming in and\n\n79\n00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.480\nbuilding a blockade, and you can't leave\nyour planet type federation here but\n\n80\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.100\nwhat we're talking about is a single\nidentity across multiple platforms.\n\n81\n00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.380\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean on that one as well.\n\n82\n00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.130\nNotice that I'm logged in to\nthe Office 365 interface here and\n\n83\n00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.500\nyou could see we've old Jimmy Hendriks\nhere is logged in to the Office 365.\n\n84\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.530\nWell what if I go over new tab here and\nwe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna type\n\n85\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.310\nMicrosoft, oh, maybe we'll type Microsoft,\nsomething close to it, right?\n\n86\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.340\nAnd then it's gonna be the Intune\naccount portal, that's what we need.\n\n87\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.650\nAnd, remember, this is where,\nas an administrator,\n\n88\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.550\nI can manage the accounts that I\nhave inside of the Microsoft Intune.\n\n89\n00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.750\nNotice that it tells me right away.\n\n90\n00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.200\nIf I look right here Notice that there,\nDan?\n\n91\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.790\nIt says I'm already signed in.\n\n92\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.660\nWell, how did it recognize me?\n\n93\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.080\nHow does it recognize me\non two different platforms?\n\n94\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.300\nWell, that is the purpose of federation,\nright?\n\n95\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.220\nWhen we talk about federation on premise,\nwhat we typically mean is,\n\n96\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.210\nyou got some kind of\nweb-aware application, right?\n\n97\n00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.360\nAnd you also have your\nActive Directory interface.\n\n98\n00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.420\nWell, wouldn't it be nice to\nlog into the web interface and\n\n99\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.190\nnot have to put in a separate\nuser account, right?\n\n100\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.441\nIt's a way we can implement something\nknown as SSO, Single Sign On and\n\n101\n00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:13.781\nif I click this username here and\nlet's see if it will let me, I've been\n\n102\n00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:20.120\nhaving trouble typing dot dot dot out here\nlet's see how well that goes for me today.\n\n103\n00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.290\nOh, see, well we'll try that again.\n\n104\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.570\n>> It's a very difficult password.\n\n105\n00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.290\n>> My grandpa used to say\nwhen I would be fishing and\n\n106\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.140\neverybody else would be catching fish,\nand I would not be catching fish,\n\n107\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.400\nof course he'd say, boy,\nare you holding your mouth right?\n\n108\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.610\nCuz I'd be doing\neverything that they were.\n\n109\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.890\nAnd it looks like it's giving me\na hard time, we'll try it again there.\n\n110\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.780\nNow with the federated identity, we should\njust be able to click the link here and\n\n111\n00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.200\nit's gonna log us in.\n\n112\n00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.230\nAnd like that, now we see that one\naccount we logged into Office,\n\n113\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.690\nwell, we're already\nlogged into Office 365.\n\n114\n00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.590\nI go to the Microsoft Intune and\nit logs me right in.\n\n115\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.920\nSo that's a nice way to implement\nsomething like a single sign on so\n\n116\n00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.500\nthat you remember one password and\nyou can log in to multiple services there.\n\n117\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.670\n>> Yeah, now Wes, this does bring up an\ninteresting question, at least in my mind.\n\n118\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.860\nIs we have federated identity,\nwhich is cool, right?\n\n119\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.990\nIt says as a single sign on I've got\none user account, one password, and\n\n120\n00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.600\nI can access multiple different platforms.\n\n121\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.056\nAnd I noticed that when you clicked on it,\nyou went straight into Intune.\n\n122\n00:06:19.056 --> 00:06:22.370\nThere was, notice that If I've never set\nup Intune before or I've never touched\n\n123\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.910\nIntune before, and I've got a federated\nID, am I able to do the same thing?\n\n124\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.080\nCan I just click on that link and\n\n125\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.730\nit takes me in and\nI can just start doing stuff to it?\n\n126\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.705\n>> Well unfortunately, the answer is no.\n\n127\n00:06:31.705 --> 00:06:36.240\n[LAUGH] What you do have to do is you\nhave to set up the Intune platform first.\n\n128\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.470\nOnce the Intune platform is already set\nup, this is where the identity now becomes\n\n129\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.340\nfederated between your tenant\nadministrator across multiple services.\n\n130\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.607\nNow you might say,\nI'm not familiar with Office 365,\n\n131\n00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:51.741\nI'm not familiar with the Intune yet, but\n\n132\n00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:56.723\ndo you have maybe an example that I\ncan see, and maybe I already use?\n\n133\n00:06:56.723 --> 00:06:59.450\nWell yes, we've got what's\nknown as the Microsoft account.\n\n134\n00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.460\nNow some of you guys have probably had\na Microsoft account for a long time.\n\n135\n00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.010\nYou say, I've never even\nstarted a Microsoft account.\n\n136\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.330\nDid you ever have a Windows Live ID?\n\n137\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.760\nThat was renamed after a certain bit of\ntime, a couple of years back I believe,\n\n138\n00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.580\nwhere they no longer called\nit the Windows Live ID.\n\n139\n00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.020\nThey called it the Microsoft account.\n\n140\n00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.240\nAnd if we check that out right here,\nyou can see that they even\n\n141\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.370\nadvertise it as one account,\nand you can log in to\n\n142\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.480\nall of these different Microsoft\ncloud-based services that we have here.\n\n143\n00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.540\nNotice that I can use this one\naccount to log into Outlook.\n\n144\n00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:40.440\nWe can use this for OneDrive, Office,\nWindows, Skype, and even Xbox Live.\n\n145\n00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.350\nThen you, MSN, Bing, and all the different\ncloud-based services that we have.\n\n146\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.957\nSo that's an example of a federated\nservice that maybe you've already seen\n\n147\n00:07:47.957 --> 00:07:51.014\nbefore and didn't realize what's\ngoing on in the background.\n\n148\n00:07:51.014 --> 00:07:53.593\nWhich if you ever pay\nattention to the link,\n\n149\n00:07:53.593 --> 00:07:58.126\nyou can tell it's federated because\nthere'll be, just for a brief second,\n\n150\n00:07:58.126 --> 00:08:02.870\nYou'll either see federated and then a\nforward slash version one or something or\n\n151\n00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.754\nyou'll see ADFS, that's the Active\nDirector Federated Services that Microsoft\n\n152\n00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:13.030\nis running in the background, in order to\ndo federated services for your account.\n\n153\n00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.530\nWhether you're in the IT environment or\nnot.\n\n154\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.990\nSo this is one that you\ncan see beforehand.\n\n155\n00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.010\nSo federated identities,\nkeep in mind as a quick recap.\n\n156\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.550\nOnline identities, they start in\nthe Cloud they stay in the Cloud.\n\n157\n00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.460\nSynchronized can be on premise or they\ncan be the ones that start in the Cloud,\n\n158\n00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.730\nstay in the Cloud, and\n\n159\n00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.990\nthey synchronize across the different\nsubscriptions that your company has.\n\n160\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.000\nYou can also see federated identities\ndoing the same thing as well as even\n\n161\n00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.390\non an individual consumer level, you could\nsee that your Microsoft account, the MC or\n\n162\n00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.860\nthe MSA as they sometimes abbreviate it.\n\n163\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.070\nFormerly known as the Windows Live ID,\nallows you to log in to\n\n164\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.740\nall Microsoft's cloud based services\nfrom the consumer standpoint as well.\n\n165\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.340\n>> Awesome.\n\n166\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.690\nNow, Wes, now that we know what an ID is,\nand the difference between the different\n\n167\n00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.870\nkinds of identities that are out there for\nus, what do we do?\n\n168\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.210\nWhere do we take that information and\n\n169\n00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.670\nhow do we start administering\nour Cloud services?\n\n170\n00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.300\n>> Very good.\nNow,\n\n171\n00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.660\none of the first things you're gonna do\nis you're gonna have to create users.\n\n172\n00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.750\nNow, I've already gone ahead and\n\n173\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.080\nset up some of the users and you've\nprobably seen us do this in the earlier\n\n174\n00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.400\nepisodes because we needed to\nset up a global administrator.\n\n175\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.340\nSo I do have all ready, ready to go user.\n\n176\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.360\nBut let's go ahead and show you how\nyou could do, you can create a user.\n\n177\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.040\nNow it's very easy here\ninside of Office 365.\n\n178\n00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.370\nYou'll see a little plus button here or\nyou'll see what's known as a bulk edit.\n\n179\n00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.220\nLet me make it a little easier for\nyou guys to see out there.\n\n180\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.150\nSo the plus is gonna be single user.\n\n181\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.620\nIf you're in a large organization\nwe'll show you this button coming up,\n\n182\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.920\nthis is where you can do bulk importing so\nif you have like a comma separated value\n\n183\n00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.080\nfile, CSV file you can just put into that\nand if you have the field in Excel already\n\n184\n00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.860\nIn your columns, it'll look at that comma\nseparated value file or CSV file and\n\n185\n00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.330\nit'll import all those and then you\ncan import basically create a whole\n\n186\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:59.270\nbunch of end users, reduce the burden of\nadministration and the complexity because,\n\n187\n00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:04.210\none file could create multiple users, I\ndon't know how many lines Excel supports,\n\n188\n00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.590\nbut, it'll definitely be\nbased on your subscription so\n\n189\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.750\nyou can do this all at one time.\n\n190\n00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.193\nLet's go ahead and show you how\nyou can create a single user here.\n\n191\n00:10:15.278 --> 00:10:18.577\nAll right, now the first thing it does\nis it takes me into the active user,\n\n192\n00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:21.040\nlooks like it wanted to refresh the page,\nthere we go.\n\n193\n00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.910\nAll right, and\nwe'll just name our user here,\n\n194\n00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.880\nand I'll keep this one relatively\neasy here for Wes's typing abilities.\n\n195\n00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.870\nUser01.\nWe'll call this User01 as well.\n\n196\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.600\nAnd User01 again.\n\n197\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.890\nAnd I'm just gonna change this,\n\n198\n00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:43.050\nI'm not gonna make the person change\ntheir password when they log in.\n\n199\n00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.940\nNow keep in mind that what happens is,\n\n200\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.830\nif you set this up, you can do two\ntypes of password generation, right?\n\n201\n00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:55.910\nWe can do an auto generation,\nan automatically generated password,\n\n202\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.600\nand what it does is it'll send to this\nemail address that you put in here,\n\n203\n00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.400\nit'll send the username and then the\ntemporary password that's put in place.\n\n204\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.160\nBut if you have some kind of onboard\npolicy, onboarding policy you might\n\n205\n00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.120\nhave a default password that you set\nall of your user names to or your user\n\n206\n00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.080\naccounts to when they first get hired on\nto the company and they can change them.\n\n207\n00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.000\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna say that, for instance,\n\n208\n00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.120\nwe have an onboarding process here.\n\n209\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.919\nSo we've got a default password\nthat we want everybody to have.\n\n210\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.770\nAll right, and I'll tell you what.\n\n211\n00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:30.830\nWe will go ahead and\n\n212\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.180\nkeep this just like we you would\ndo in a corporate environment.\n\n213\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.080\nWe'll make em change their\npassword when they log in.\n\n214\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.720\nNow here is something that's interesting.\n\n215\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.830\nOne of the great things is in a single\nlocation, notice that I can manage my\n\n216\n00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:46.790\nOffice 365 account license as well\nas my Microsoft InTune license.\n\n217\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:51.580\nIf I say, maybe I say right now that\nperson, I don't have any reason for\n\n218\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.860\nthem to chew-up one of my InTune licenses,\nso\n\n219\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.700\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust create him here in Office365.\n\n220\n00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:07.160\nAll right, now, you can always configure\nthis, oh, oh, I already created a User01.\n\n221\n00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.760\nYeah, so no duplicate user names,\nno duplicate addresses.\n\n222\n00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.610\nLet me go ahead and put User02 here.\n\n223\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.820\n>> Everyone's gotta be unique.\n\n224\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.340\n>> Why do we, we've gotta have\nour own unique identities.\n\n225\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.530\nI wanna stand out from the rest.\n\n226\n00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.480\nAll right, and then it gives you, it\nlest you know that here's the user name,\n\n227\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.030\nthere's the password, and\nthe license ability, or\n\n228\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.430\nthe license that's been applied to it.\n\n229\n00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.989\nAnd it is good to know that.\n\n230\n00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.380\nAll right then the user comes up here.\n\n231\n00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.350\nNow if we wanna manage this user,\nall we have to do is select the user and\n\n232\n00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.240\nmy head is kinda covered it up here but\n\n233\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.275\nyou can see down here in the lower right\nhand corner that we've got the ability\n\n234\n00:12:42.275 --> 00:12:46.775\nthat if somebody forgets their password or\nis like me and\n\n235\n00:12:46.775 --> 00:12:49.625\ndoesn't know how to type a password right,\nyou can always reset the password.\n\n236\n00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:51.965\nWe could do complete management here.\n\n237\n00:12:51.965 --> 00:12:53.525\nWe can delete the user.\n\n238\n00:12:53.525 --> 00:12:55.585\nI don't know why we'd want to do that.\n\n239\n00:12:55.585 --> 00:12:57.655\nWe can also add them to a group.\n\n240\n00:12:57.655 --> 00:13:01.235\nAnd that is something that\nyou want to make sure-\n\n241\n00:13:01.235 --> 00:13:02.615\n>> You usually delete users that don't\n\n242\n00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.165\nexist anymore.\n\n243\n00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:03.814\n>> That's right.\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n244\n00:13:03.814 --> 00:13:05.425\n>> [LAUGH] Maybe they don't work for\nyour company,\n\n245\n00:13:05.425 --> 00:13:07.330\nor there just not apart of you're system.\n\n246\n00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.960\n>> Well you know, that's interesting that\nyou mentioned that too Dan because that\n\n247\n00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.530\nbrings us into one of the next concepts\nthat you have to be aware of for\n\n248\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.460\nthe MTA exam.\n\n249\n00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.520\nAnd that it's deleting those users\nthrough what is known as a soft delete.\n\n250\n00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.610\nNow, if you've ever been familiar with\nlike active directory, you know that their\n\n251\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.120\nis a process called a tombstonning process\nthat you're users go through, right.\n\n252\n00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.720\nIf I delete a user, that's an identity and\nthat identity is attached to all of\n\n253\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.690\nthe documentation, all of the files and\nthe resources, the emails that a person\n\n254\n00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.330\nhas been using with that identity, and\nunfortunately, if I delete that identity,\n\n255\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:44.210\nthen I delete access to all of\nthe resources that user had access to.\n\n256\n00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.420\nSo this kinda protects,\nin active directory,\n\n257\n00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.020\nyou kinda protect yourself from that.\n\n258\n00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.550\n>> Because it doesn't take it out\nof the active directory database.\n\n259\n00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.850\nWell, let me show you something here, too.\n\n260\n00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:58.970\nNotice that the, over here, it says,\nin this note, it says active users.\n\n261\n00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.949\nNotice that there is also\na deleted user location.\n\n262\n00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.670\n>> All right, and\nI do have a deleted user.\n\n263\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.160\nNow what is,\nwhat's up with this user here?\n\n264\n00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.700\nWell, I can always, if I choose to,\nI can restore the user.\n\n265\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:18.200\nLet's say for instance, what I thought,\nsomebody was maybe leaving the company and\n\n266\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.940\nthey realize that, hey, they wanna be\nwith us, they don't wanna leave, right.\n\n267\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.430\nWell I've deleted their account\nbecause I don't want them to have\n\n268\n00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.800\naccess to my infrastructure if\nthey're not gonna work for me anymore.\n\n269\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.130\nSo what this does is it temporarily\ndisables it for a 30 day period, and\n\n270\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.880\nyou get the ability to restore the user.\n\n271\n00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.370\nAnd let me go ahead and\nshow you that deleting an active user.\n\n272\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.410\nAll right, so\nover here on the lower right hand side.\n\n273\n00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.490\nYou'll see the delete option,\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n274\n00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.260\nAnd notice that it says,\nwhen you delete the user and\n\n275\n00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.140\ntheir license, the license can\nbe assign to other users but\n\n276\n00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.470\nyou can restore the user for\nup to 30 days which is a good process.\n\n277\n00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.730\nBecause let me give this in contacts,\n\n278\n00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.480\nmaybe this user that I'm deleting has been\nworking on sensitive patent information,\n\n279\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.340\nfor whatever reason they don't work for\nour company.\n\n280\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.360\nIf I delete this identity then I\ndelete the identity that was used to\n\n281\n00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.330\naccess that sensitive\npatented information.\n\n282\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.100\nSo as an administrator this would\ngive me the ability to go in and\n\n283\n00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.830\nreset the password,\ntake control over all of those resources.\n\n284\n00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.420\nOnce I've assigned those resources to\nsomebody else and I know they have\n\n285\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.730\naccess to them then I can come in here and\npermanently delete their account.\n\n286\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:32.810\nSo when we delete them it takes them\nout of the active user location,\n\n287\n00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.570\nnotice it's gone here.\n\n288\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.180\nWe go over to the deleted user here and\ngive it a second to refresh it, and\n\n289\n00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.109\nwe should, there it goes,\nit shows up right there.\n\n290\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.568\nNow on the Microsoft Intune side,\nadmin page.\n\n291\n00:15:45.568 --> 00:15:48.508\nWhen you're creating\nusers you can create them\n\n292\n00:15:48.508 --> 00:15:51.163\ndirectly from the Intune console itself.\n\n293\n00:15:51.163 --> 00:15:57.070\nBut one of the great things is Is your\nusers inside here will synchronize.\n\n294\n00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.881\nYou'll notice that right\nthere is old Janis Joplin,\n\n295\n00:15:59.881 --> 00:16:03.830\nalready been synchronized over and\nI didn't need to create the user here.\n\n296\n00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.090\nSo that's where we get a combination of\n\n297\n00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:13.030\nthe synchronized identitie, and\nyou can see that right here so.\n\n298\n00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.730\nIf I wanted to create a user, notice that\nthe process is pretty much the same.\n\n299\n00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.090\nYou can also do a bulk ad here,\nor an individual user,\n\n300\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.130\nuser by user basis if you wanted to.\n\n301\n00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.240\nWe'll just go ahead and\nshow you creating a user here.\n\n302\n00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.370\nNow this user is going to be directly\ntied to you're Intune accounts.\n\n303\n00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.970\nI'll just do User 10 here.\n\n304\n00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.730\nDisplay name, and we'll do User 10 again.\n\n305\n00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.480\nAnd here we go.\n\n306\n00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.460\nAnd I'm not gonna assign a role.\n\n307\n00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:47.900\nYou have to assign the location, because\nthe location, really is important for\n\n308\n00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.979\nwhat services are being delivered, and\nwhere they're being delivered from.\n\n309\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.330\nRemember, as we've talked about in\nother episodes, keep in in mind\n\n310\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.470\nthat with in some of those other episodes,\nwe talked about the data centers,\n\n311\n00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.340\nand where the data's stored and its\ngeographically dispersed across the world.\n\n312\n00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.080\nSo the location that you\npick here is important.\n\n313\n00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.180\nYou wanna make sure that you're\npicking the location for\n\n314\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.409\nwhere this user really does live or\nreside.\n\n315\n00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.410\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n316\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.250\nAnd it's gonna send me an email.\n\n317\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.960\nIt's gonna let me know that\nthat user was created.\n\n318\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.150\nAll right, so fairly easy to do.\n\n319\n00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:26.260\nIf we need to create things like groups,\nwe can do that here as well.\n\n320\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.819\nGroups are just as easy to create.\n\n321\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.470\nI'll tell you what,\nlet me go over to the Intune site.\n\n322\n00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.240\nWe've been spending a lot of time\ninside instead of Office 365,\n\n323\n00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.840\nlet me go ahead and show you.\n\n324\n00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.960\nSecurity groups, very easy to create,\nyou might just say,\n\n325\n00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:48.560\nmaybe this is the ITProTV Staff.\n\n326\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.710\nAnd we choose Save.\n\n327\n00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.720\nAnd now we can manage the group\nall from this interface too.\n\n328\n00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.670\nI can have that User\n10 in there if I want.\n\n329\n00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.590\nChoose add and then save and close.\n\n330\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.400\nAnd now I've got a second group created,\nI can look inside of that group and\n\n331\n00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.240\nif I want to, I can see the members.\n\n332\n00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.620\nAnd if I need to manage it from here,\nI can also manage it from here too.\n\n333\n00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.140\nSo fairly straightforward process.\n\n334\n00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.460\nNot too difficult there.\n\n335\n00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.500\nOne of the things I will mention,\nis the license that we were talking about.\n\n336\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.840\nOne of the things it'll let you know.\n\n337\n00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.380\nAnd let me go ahead and\nrestore this user here real quick.\n\n338\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:32.010\nSo I can show you the assigning and\nthe revoking of the license.\n\n339\n00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.910\nNotice that one thing that we did\nwhen we created that user too, Dan.\n\n340\n00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.730\nIn Microsoft Intune is we\ndetermined its location.\n\n341\n00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.550\nThat is very, very important to make\nsure that the location is determined.\n\n342\n00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.980\nCuz like I said,\nit really matters what the service is.\n\n343\n00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.770\nWe go back to the active user and\nsee if it'll give us that warning.\n\n344\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.620\nNotice User 10's already showed up.\n\n345\n00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.200\nWe created that in Intune.\n\n346\n00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.069\nIf you remember,\nI just created that in Intune here.\n\n347\n00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.810\nDidn't created over there in Office 365,\nand yet it's already synchronized and it's\n\n348\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:04.530\nshowing up in Office 365 as an identity,\nso that's really a good thing here.\n\n349\n00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.290\nI tell you what, let's go ahead and delete\nthis user again, and see if that warning\n\n350\n00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:16.040\nwill come back up, now notice this\nis also, revoking of the license.\n\n351\n00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:22.190\nWhen you create a user, notice that\nit gave me the option, excuse me,\n\n352\n00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.560\nto tie an Office 365 E-5 license to\nthat user or the Intune license.\n\n353\n00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.920\nNow, when I delete the user,\nit just does the opposite.\n\n354\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.960\nIt says if you delete this user,\nyou can take their license.\n\n355\n00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.060\nAnd now, it's not counted against you,\n\n356\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.570\nand that license can be now allocated to\nan addition user that's either created,\n\n357\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.080\nor will be created, so\nit's a good thing, there.\n\n358\n00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.220\nSo you're not wasting a whole bunch of\nyour license on users that are sitting on\n\n359\n00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.050\nthat deleted user, but they haven't been\ncompletely removed from your interface.\n\n360\n00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.470\nSo we can choose close,\nso for the most part,\n\n361\n00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:58.760\nfairly straightforward process when\nit comes to managing your users,\n\n362\n00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.290\nmanaging your groups, assigning licenses\nand revoking those licenses as well.\n\n363\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.530\n>> Yeah it's a very simple process.\n\n364\n00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:08.990\nI like how they've made it very intuitive,\nvery easy to follow, it doesn't take\n\n365\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:14.430\na lot of reading or trying to figure out,\nwhat is it they want me to do here.\n\n366\n00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.290\nSo, very straightforward.\n\n367\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.850\nAnd that's what we like when it\ncomes to user administration.\n\n368\n00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:22.330\nNow, speaking of user administration,\nyou cannot talk about user and\n\n369\n00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.310\ngroup administration,\nwithout talking about permissions.\n\n370\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.740\nBecause the whole purpose\nof having a user is so\n\n371\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.660\nthat I can differentiate between\nthis user and that user.\n\n372\n00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.120\nSo they've got their own user account, and\n\n373\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.890\nthis other person has\ntheir own user account.\n\n374\n00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.120\nSo that I can differentiate\nwho has access to what.\n\n375\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.480\nAnd that should be our logical next step,\nright West?\n\n376\n00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.150\nIs assigning permissions\nto either users or groups.\n\n377\n00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.850\nSo when it comes to permissions, what we\ntypically think about assigning groups and\n\n378\n00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.700\npermissions is gonna be something that\nwe're really not doing right here.\n\n379\n00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:54.700\nWhat we're doing inside of the Office\n365 interface, is actually assigning\n\n380\n00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.480\nwhen they say permission,\nthe roles to the administrator.\n\n381\n00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.400\nSo that's important to keep in mind.\n\n382\n00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.530\nWhen it comes to the permissions,\nDan, like you and\n\n383\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.770\nI are thinking of,\nyou know like setting things like ACLs and\n\n384\n00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.220\nstuff, it's really specific to\nthe service that you're using.\n\n385\n00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.690\nFor instance if you're\ncreating a Share Point site,\n\n386\n00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.570\nwho do you want to allow to view that?\n\n387\n00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:16.930\nWell that's going to be something that\nyou do inside of this Share Point admin\n\n388\n00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.930\ncenter or exchange.\n\n389\n00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.245\nWhat we wanna show you here is\nhow to assign and revoke roles,\n\n390\n00:21:22.245 --> 00:21:26.850\nstill a permission, right, that you\ncan do in the Office 365 interface.\n\n391\n00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.960\nSo pretty simplistic to do, right?\n\n392\n00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.060\nAll we have to do is select the end user.\n\n393\n00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.350\nAnd we come over here.\n\n394\n00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.370\nMy head's kind of blocking it there.\n\n395\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:38.410\nAnd we can choose edit user roles, and\n\n396\n00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:43.090\nI can assign whichever\ncustomized role I want.\n\n397\n00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.090\nIf it's a global administrator,\nI can sign that.\n\n398\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.980\nBut let's say we don't want somebody\nto be the password administrator.\n\n399\n00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.190\nLet's say maybe I want to revoke\nthe password administrator role, and\n\n400\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.100\nturn it around and\nassign the exchange administrator role.\n\n401\n00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:00.210\nI can choose Save, and\nin a second here, just like that,\n\n402\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.560\nit will assign one role and\nit will revoke another one.\n\n403\n00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:09.080\nSo you keep in mind, fairly easy to\nmanage those administrative roles.\n\n404\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.950\nNow I say easy to manage,\nbecause it's a click of a button.\n\n405\n00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.700\nIt doesn't mean that it's easy to plan for\nright?\n\n406\n00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.435\nYou always have to do your planning.\n\n407\n00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:20.610\nYou'll remember if you're gonna set for\ninstance, a password administrator, or\n\n408\n00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.940\na billing administrator, or\ndefinitely a global administrator,\n\n409\n00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:28.110\nyou're gonna wanna entrust that to\nsomebody that is know within the company,\n\n410\n00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.580\na trusted user, a trusted identity.\n\n411\n00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.380\nNow the other thing that you\ncan do inside of Office 365,\n\n412\n00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.050\nis you can do what's known as\ndelegation of administration.\n\n413\n00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.890\nNow this is a little bit different than\nmaybe some of the concepts maybe you've\n\n414\n00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:43.610\nseen inside of Active Directory, right?\n\n415\n00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.670\nWhere I take a certain location within the\nActive Directory infrastructure and I say,\n\n416\n00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.570\nyou know what Dan, this organizational\nunit, you're in charge of and everything\n\n417\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.630\nunder it, and I just hand that over in\nthe Active Directory infrastructure.\n\n418\n00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.620\nI delegate it to him and\nnow he can administer to it.\n\n419\n00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.990\nThis is a little bit different,\n\n420\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.615\nwhen we talk about delegating\nadministration in the cloud.\n\n421\n00:23:03.615 --> 00:23:08.885\nWhat you're talking about is allowing\na authorized Microsoft partner\n\n422\n00:23:08.885 --> 00:23:10.795\nto manage your infrastructure.\n\n423\n00:23:10.795 --> 00:23:12.815\nSo the concepts are just\na little bit different.\n\n424\n00:23:12.815 --> 00:23:17.002\nSo if you're used to delegation of\nadministration inside of a product\n\n425\n00:23:17.002 --> 00:23:18.292\nlike Active Directory,\n\n426\n00:23:18.292 --> 00:23:22.992\nwhile the concept is close, we are not\ntalking about something in house, right?\n\n427\n00:23:22.992 --> 00:23:24.792\nWe're talking about a third party outside.\n\n428\n00:23:24.792 --> 00:23:28.000\nLet me go ahead and show you how\nyou would do something like that.\n\n429\n00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.230\nUnder our active users, our deleted users.\n\n430\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.050\nRemember the soft deletes\nwe've talked about.\n\n431\n00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.290\nWe also have partner relationships here.\n\n432\n00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.410\nAnd I can choose partner relationship.\n\n433\n00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:42.713\nAnd notice that I don't have right now,\nany delegated administrators.\n\n434\n00:23:42.713 --> 00:23:46.880\nThe reason being here, is you have to go\nto what is known as Microsoft Pinpoint.\n\n435\n00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.386\nAnd with Microsoft Pinpoint you put your\norganization's information there, and\n\n436\n00:23:50.386 --> 00:23:52.000\nyou're kind of marketing yourself.\n\n437\n00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.360\nAnd you're letting the other\nauthorized partners know that hey,\n\n438\n00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.649\nI need somebody to come in here and\nI want you.\n\n439\n00:23:57.649 --> 00:24:01.926\nI'm gonna delegate that administration\non my transfer administration over to\n\n440\n00:24:01.926 --> 00:24:04.940\nan authorized partner and\nthat they can do it for you.\n\n441\n00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.246\n>> Kind of outsourcing.\n\n442\n00:24:06.246 --> 00:24:09.690\n>> It really is, they think about that\nwe do outsourcing on premise we say we\n\n443\n00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.450\nwant the security team to come in here and\nmake sure that we're in compliance but,\n\n444\n00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.760\nwe're not handling it.\n\n445\n00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.492\nIt's the exact same concept Danny.\n\n446\n00:24:15.492 --> 00:24:19.125\nIt's saying hey I'm gonna transfer this\nadministration to a third party that\n\n447\n00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:21.448\nwe can trust and\nthey have to go through a process.\n\n448\n00:24:21.448 --> 00:24:24.454\nThey have to be recognized as\nan authorized Microsoft partner.\n\n449\n00:24:24.454 --> 00:24:27.375\nYou're not just authorizing this to,\nI don't know,\n\n450\n00:24:27.375 --> 00:24:29.795\nBill's computer warehouse\nout back [LAUGH].\n\n451\n00:24:29.795 --> 00:24:33.823\nSo they have to go through\na process to be able to do that.\n\n452\n00:24:33.823 --> 00:24:38.690\nThe other thing that we can do is we can\nalso manage subscriptions from here if\n\n453\n00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.460\nwe need to.\n\n454\n00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.050\nSo, for instance, billing.\n\n455\n00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.790\nIf I go over to the billing side and\nI'll show you guys this both in\n\n456\n00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:48.080\nthe Office 365 and\nthey also have it in the Microsoft Intune.\n\n457\n00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.270\nNotice that if I've got, if I want\nto manage the subscriptions here,\n\n458\n00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.019\nyou can do this all through\nthis interface right here.\n\n459\n00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.540\nLicense, I can see what license I have.\n\n460\n00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.390\nNotice that it's showing me right now,\nit's showing me that\n\n461\n00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.895\nwhen it comes to Intune and\nOffice 365 E5 level subscription,\n\n462\n00:25:05.895 --> 00:25:10.345\nnotice that it's telling me right\nthere where my licenses are.\n\n463\n00:25:10.345 --> 00:25:11.865\nAre they assigned?\n\n464\n00:25:11.865 --> 00:25:13.495\nAre they expired, right?\n\n465\n00:25:13.495 --> 00:25:17.072\nWe wanna know if the license expired or\nnot because what good does a license do if\n\n466\n00:25:17.072 --> 00:25:19.522\nyou can't use the software\nthat's being licensed?\n\n467\n00:25:19.522 --> 00:25:23.160\nSo, it is a good way to be proactive.\n\n468\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.490\nLet me go ahead and\njump over and show you the same,\n\n469\n00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:31.150\npretty much the same concept over here\nin the Microsoft Intune interface.\n\n470\n00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.860\nWhen it comes to managing subscriptions,\nwe can do that all through this interface.\n\n471\n00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.720\nYou'll notice it's, even on the layouts\njust a little bit different.\n\n472\n00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.200\nNot too complex here.\n\n473\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.500\nAnd you can see under manage here,\nI've got my window or excuse me,\n\n474\n00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.830\nmy Microsoft Intune.\n\n475\n00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.980\nBad habit because I used to really\nwork with this when it was called\n\n476\n00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.490\nWindows Intune, so just rebranding\nof the same technology here.\n\n477\n00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.940\nBut I can see there's Microsoft Intune,\nhow many licences do I have and\n\n478\n00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.680\nit's a trial account.\n\n479\n00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.532\nAnd it even lets me know when\nthat license expires too,\n\n480\n00:26:01.532 --> 00:26:05.290\nso that's good to find out\nthat licensing information.\n\n481\n00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.660\nAnd remember, if you wanna purchase\nlicense, you can do that as well.\n\n482\n00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.772\nYou could purchase additional software,\nso not really too difficult here.\n\n483\n00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:17.710\nOne of the things that you might wanna\ndo in your infrastructure as well,\n\n484\n00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:21.220\nis you might want to manage\nthings like password policies.\n\n485\n00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.250\nWell, can I manage a password\npolicy through Intune console?\n\n486\n00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.640\nWell you can so far and\n\n487\n00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.710\nlet me be very clear with this\nbecause this gets a little confusing.\n\n488\n00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.720\nYou might think that this is where\nI manage the Windows Intune,\n\n489\n00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.590\nthe Microsoft Intune settings here,\nbut it's not.\n\n490\n00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.480\nThis is the account portal, and\nwith the account portal that's\n\n491\n00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.040\nall you manage are the accounts,\nthe license, the subscriptions.\n\n492\n00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.210\nRight here in the middle,\nyou'll see Admin Console.\n\n493\n00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.270\nWe're gonna look at the Company Portal\nwhen it comes to the installation of\n\n494\n00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:56.808\na client here on the client side, but I\nneed to switch over to the console itself.\n\n495\n00:26:56.808 --> 00:27:01.840\nAnd it might have me log back in\nbecause again for security purposes,\n\n496\n00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.040\nif you've timed out there,\nit definitely want you to reauthenticate.\n\n497\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.990\nSo let's go ahead,\nlet it go ahead and reauthenticate.\n\n498\n00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:15.570\nAnd now we're getting into\nthe admin console where you manage.\n\n499\n00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:19.630\nYou do manage your devices,\nyou manage your computers.\n\n500\n00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.590\nYou take your identities and\nyou link them to computers,\n\n501\n00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:27.250\nwhich we'll show you some of\nthat in another episode here.\n\n502\n00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.550\nBut there's a policy section down here in\nthe left hand side towards the bottom,\n\n503\n00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.230\nright there.\n\n504\n00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.390\nAnd I can set password policies here.\n\n505\n00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.720\nAnd depending on what kind\nof device that I might have,\n\n506\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.050\nI can set mobile device\nmanagement policies.\n\n507\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.750\nI can set policies that not\nonly affect mobile devices,\n\n508\n00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.440\nthey affect RT tablets as well\nas client computers here.\n\n509\n00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.770\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you that real quick.\n\n510\n00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.440\nAll right, policies,\nthe one that we're really looking for\n\n511\n00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.190\nright now is just a password.\n\n512\n00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:00.730\nHow can we modify or the criteria\nthat we need for our passwords?\n\n513\n00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.879\nAnd you do that under\nconfiguration policies.\n\n514\n00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.340\nAll right, and\nI'm going to go ahead and add a policy.\n\n515\n00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.400\nAnd it is, one of the reasons\nthey switched the name from\n\n516\n00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.120\nWindows Intune to Microsoft Intune,\nbecause it was a little confusing.\n\n517\n00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.380\nYou say Windows Intune, so\nit only manages Windows?\n\n518\n00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.970\nNo that's not the case,\nit manages a lot of the devices.\n\n519\n00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.380\nSo that's one of the reasons\nthey took the Windows off and\n\n520\n00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.590\nput the Microsoft in there.\n\n521\n00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:28.280\nBecause it doesn't just\nmanage Microsoft devices.\n\n522\n00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:33.230\nSo if I look for Windows, make sure\nthat if you're configuring the password\n\n523\n00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.430\npolicy you pay attention to the devices\nthat you're configuring cuz you could see\n\n524\n00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:41.600\nthere are a bunch of configurations\nin here and you can notice, for\n\n525\n00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.850\ninstance this one says 8.1 and later.\n\n526\n00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.680\nThis wouldn't be a policy that obviously,\nyou guys are smart out there.\n\n527\n00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.060\nI could apply this to a Windows\n10 machine and have it work.\n\n528\n00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.830\nSo again, little bit of planning.\n\n529\n00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.890\nWe'll do a custom configuration and\nsome of these policies,\n\n530\n00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:57.560\nwe'll get more into the policy\ncreation a little bit later, but\n\n531\n00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.710\nyou can see a template versus a custom.\n\n532\n00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.070\nThis one only allows you\nto customize policy and\n\n533\n00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.880\nwhat we want to focus in\non is a password policy.\n\n534\n00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.590\nSo I'll just go ahead and do Password.\n\n535\n00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:15.310\nAnd we'll call this Description, we'll say\nWindows 10 machines, we'll say Windows 10.\n\n536\n00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:19.963\nAnd maybe even, maybe we've got\nsome Windows 10 RT tablets, or\n\n537\n00:29:19.963 --> 00:29:22.690\nyeah, Windows 10 RT.\n\n538\n00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:27.359\nSo maybe we'll wanna do some\nmobile devices as well.\n\n539\n00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:28.532\nAnd.\n\n540\n00:29:30.773 --> 00:29:31.736\nLet's see here.\n\n541\n00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:33.100\nWe'll go ahead and save the policy.\n\n542\n00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:39.460\nAnd we'll deploy this later, cuz we've got\nan episode on deploying the policies, too.\n\n543\n00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.160\nAnd we'll choose edit.\n\n544\n00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.860\nNow, let me be clear on this one.\n\n545\n00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.390\nCustom Configuration Policy\nyou'll see is one that\n\n546\n00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:46.900\ndoesn't actually set the passwords.\n\n547\n00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.140\nWhat you need is\nthe General Configuration Policy.\n\n548\n00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.860\nAnd when you create the general\nconfiguration policy,\n\n549\n00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.610\nnotice that I've just named it password,\nI'll put password2 here so\n\n550\n00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:59.370\nthere's no conflicts with the password,\nor the policy that I misconfigured.\n\n551\n00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.660\nThat doesn't have the settings\nin it that you need.\n\n552\n00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.600\nBut when you do the general configuration,\nwhether it's Windows 8.1 and\n\n553\n00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.940\nabove or Windows 10, I chose one for\n\n554\n00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.530\nWindows 10 here like I did in the first\none that was the wrong policy.\n\n555\n00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.700\nYou'll notice that I can scroll down and\nI know these are kinda hard to see so\n\n556\n00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.080\nlet me try to make them\na little bit easier to see,\n\n557\n00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.710\nnotice that I can manage the different\ncharacteristics of the policy.\n\n558\n00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.170\nNow this will affect your devices\ndifferently keep in mind,\n\n559\n00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:26.880\nmaybe you don't want your computers and\n\n560\n00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:31.130\nWindows 10 may allow you to do\nthe quick pin passwords to log in.\n\n561\n00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:35.550\nWell I might want to say you\nknow I don't wanna quick pin so,\n\n562\n00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.850\nI might tell it you know,\nallow pin or picture passwords right,\n\n563\n00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.570\nthat's specific to Windows 8.1 or\nWindows 10.\n\n564\n00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:45.520\nWell, guess what, maybe I don;t\nwanna do that so, notice it's not,\n\n565\n00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.640\nit isn't defined by default so,\nI could have turn allow.\n\n566\n00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.442\nAnd kind of like group policy,\nthis is where it gets confusing,\n\n567\n00:30:54.442 --> 00:30:56.845\nyou enable something to disable it, right?\n\n568\n00:30:56.845 --> 00:30:59.929\nSo notice it says,\nbe careful on the wording here,\n\n569\n00:30:59.929 --> 00:31:02.673\nallow the PIN and picture password, right?\n\n570\n00:31:02.673 --> 00:31:04.927\nAnd it says no or yes.\n\n571\n00:31:04.927 --> 00:31:06.450\nAnd what I can do is just say that.\n\n572\n00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.810\nMaybe that's just going to\nbe the simplicity of it.\n\n573\n00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.080\nMaybe I wanna choose\nremember password history.\n\n574\n00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.140\nAnd I say, yes, and how many attempts.\n\n575\n00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.940\nNow, Dan, you might be asking yourself,\nwell wait a second,\n\n576\n00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.350\ncan't we do this with Active Directory?\n\n577\n00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.930\n>> Well, wait a second,\ncan't we do this Active Directory?\n\n578\n00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:20.620\n>> Well, we sure can.\n\n579\n00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.390\nWe sure can do this with\nActive Directory but\n\n580\n00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:26.910\nwhat if you have a Windows 10 machine\nthat isn't professional or enterprise?\n\n581\n00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.760\nNo password policies there and\nwe know that we have a lot of people.\n\n582\n00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.400\nYou might have people in\nyour organization, right,\n\n583\n00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.260\nthat are connecting from home.\n\n584\n00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:37.230\nMaybe they don't have an enterprise or\nprofessional level Windows operating\n\n585\n00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.560\nsystem at home but\nyou still want them to be able to work and\n\n586\n00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.790\nyou wanna be able to reach out across\nthe Internet And maintain some kind\n\n587\n00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:48.410\nof security, even though it can't be\nformally a part of your corporate domain.\n\n588\n00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:49.550\nWhat about Windows RT?\n\n589\n00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.920\nWindows RT tablets, doesn't matter\nif it's 8, 8.1 or Windows 10,\n\n590\n00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.450\nthey can't join a domain.\n\n591\n00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.240\nSo you can have all these tablets,\neven buying them for\n\n592\n00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.910\nan enterprise purpose, but\nyou can't join them to your domain.\n\n593\n00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:02.670\nSo how do you manage these devices?\n\n594\n00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:06.060\nAnd that's where these mobile device\nmanagement policies come in that\n\n595\n00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.130\nalso can apply to client\nworkstations as well.\n\n596\n00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:16.720\nAnd I can choose save the policy here, and\nmake sure I named everything accordingly.\n\n597\n00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.060\nAnd we're not gonna deploy it now because\nI wanna show you that in another episode,\n\n598\n00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.600\nbut cuz we're really,\nreally just focused on password policies,\n\n599\n00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.390\nI do just wanna make one clarification.\n\n600\n00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.210\nLike I said, this policy was\nthe custom configuration guys and\n\n601\n00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.460\nI'm gonna have to delete that one.\n\n602\n00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.520\nThat wasn't the right policy.\n\n603\n00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.830\nWhat you need is just\na generalized configuration.\n\n604\n00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.070\nSo just like this,\nwe can delete the policy.\n\n605\n00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:45.800\nAnd we can say yep, I meant to delete\nthe policy, and we should be good to go.\n\n606\n00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.490\nSo, fairly straightforward process for\nmanaging your passwords, here.\n\n607\n00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:55.130\nNot too complex, and you can start to\nget your infrastructure, Office365, and\n\n608\n00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.250\nthe Microsoft Intune platform\nready to go there, Dan.\n\n609\n00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:59.260\n>> Yeah, very cool stuff.\n\n610\n00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.666\nIt's obviously these are the kinda things\nthat you're going to be doing if you're\n\n611\n00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:05.230\nworking with an Office 365 or\nIntune environment.\n\n612\n00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.180\nSo the things that we wanna make\nsure that you are aware of,\n\n613\n00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.090\nnot too difficult as\nyou've seen with Wes here.\n\n614\n00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.600\nVery straightforward,\nintuitive interface, so we like it.\n\n615\n00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.530\nWes, I know you have a little bit\nmore that you need to show us.\n\n616\n00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.650\nBut we are sorely out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n617\n00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:20.230\nWe'll have to come back and do a part two.\n\n618\n00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:22.070\nI can't wait to have you back and\nsee what you have left.\n\n619\n00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.610\n>> Thank you.\n\n620\n00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.520\n>> For everybody else.\n\n621\n00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.860\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nclose down this show.\n\n622\n00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.570\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n623\n00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:29.440\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n624\n00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.309\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n625\n00:33:30.309 --> 00:33:31.730\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:13.752\nexciting episode of ITProTV I'm your host,\nDaniel Lowrie,\n\n4\n00:00:13.752 --> 00:00:21.710\nand in today's episode we are continuing\non our MTA cloud fundamental series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.450\nActually this is a part two of\nadministering cloud services.\n\n6\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.140\nSo we're jumping right back in there, and\n\n7\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.760\njoining me again today is none other\nthan my good friend, Mr. Wes Brian.\n\n8\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.980\nWes, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.480\nI know we've got a lot of\ncool stuff to go over.\n\n10\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.615\nHow are you first?\n\n11\n00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:37.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> I've been doing great and thanks for\n\n12\n00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.920\nhaving me here, and\nthat's why we're gonna be looking at some\n\n13\n00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.450\nof the stuff that we couldn't quite fit\ninto the first part of this episode.\n\n14\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.670\nIf you haven't seen that episode,\ngo back and check out the first part.\n\n15\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.170\nWe talked about the different types\nof identities and how to create and\n\n16\n00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.180\nmanage our users as well.\n\n17\n00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.190\nAs well assigning\n\n18\n00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.880\nthose roles to your administrators as well\nas managing subscriptions and license.\n\n19\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.660\nA lot of good stuff in\nthe first part here, but\n\n20\n00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.430\nwhat we didn't get to\nfit in is the service.\n\n21\n00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.330\nThe services that we have.\n\n22\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.180\nWe need to make sure that\nthe services are available,\n\n23\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.290\nand there might not be much that we can\ndo with software as a service as we've\n\n24\n00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.420\ntouched base in some of the previous\nepisodes here, but at least we get\n\n25\n00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.120\nthe ability to see what the current status\nis for the service that we have, and\n\n26\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.250\nsome of the services that go along with\nOffice 365 as well as Microsoft Intune.\n\n27\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.170\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n28\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.760\nWe'll jump right in, and the first one\nI'm in here is the Microsoft Intune\n\n29\n00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.920\nplatform here, and\nwith this Fairly easy here.\n\n30\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.120\nWe look down,\nyou'll see a couple of options here.\n\n31\n00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.200\nSupport, service requests and\nservice health.\n\n32\n00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.470\nWell, we want, specifically,\nwe wanna look at that service health, and\n\n33\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.960\nwe wanna find out,\nwell how is Microsoft Intune doing today.\n\n34\n00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.360\nNow this is a really\ngood thing here as well.\n\n35\n00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.430\nNotice that it's telling me all of\nthe different service instances\n\n36\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.500\nthat are spread out across the world,\nreally, North America here, too.\n\n37\n00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.590\nNotice that it says everything\nis operational and functional.\n\n38\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.470\nThey do have things like planned\nmaintenance schedules here and\n\n39\n00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.070\nyou can see that the instance will\nbe going through some maintenance.\n\n40\n00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.380\nSo that's good to know that hey if they\nare gonna do some kind of peaks and\n\n41\n00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.995\ntweaks in the background which, it's\ngreat that we We don't have to do this.\n\n42\n00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:24.485\nWe're paying them to do this for us, but\nit's also good that we know about that.\n\n43\n00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:28.515\nSo, seeing the service health,\nas well as what the plans,\n\n44\n00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:32.555\nmaintenance schedule is always good to\nhave, and another thing that's really,\n\n45\n00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:38.930\nreally cool too about this is If I wanted\nto subscribe for an RSS feed, maybe I know\n\n46\n00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.420\nthat a lot of my instances are in\nthe North American region.\n\n47\n00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.350\nWell I can always just take one of\nthese these RSS feeds here, and\n\n48\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.940\nI can subscribe to them.\n\n49\n00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.760\nOpen the RSS feed here,\n\n50\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.930\ntakes you to a traditional really\nsimple syndication webpage.\n\n51\n00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.380\nWe can choose subscribe.\n\n52\n00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.100\nPut's it right there in internet explorer,\n\n53\n00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.360\nand now when we need to\nfind out what's going on.\n\n54\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.460\nWhat's going on with\nthat location where maybe\n\n55\n00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.500\nmy tenant might have it's data stored.\n\n56\n00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.170\nI can find out what is the service health,\nso fairly easy on that,\n\n57\n00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.840\nand again with the plan maintenance\nwe can also see the history.\n\n58\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.580\nMaybe we're looking for reliablility.\n\n59\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.030\nMaybe with the Office, and\nthe Office 365, and the Microsoft Intune.\n\n60\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.220\nRemember you get into this SLA,\nthis service level agreement, and\n\n61\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.510\nthey've got a guarantee of 99.9% up time.\n\n62\n00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.810\nMaybe I wanna see if they're putting\ntheir money where their mouth is so\n\n63\n00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.130\nI can look at a service history and\nfind out if everything is good.\n\n64\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.650\nWe can also do this in\nthe Office 365 interface, and\n\n65\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.630\nwe touched base just a little bit\non this in a previous episode, but\n\n66\n00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.420\nwe definitely want to look at it here for\nthe MTA Cloud Fundamentals exam that\n\n67\n00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.510\nyou'll be taking, and\nService Health, notice that,\n\n68\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.930\nwell, they don't make it too cryptographic\nhere, you can tell it right up front.\n\n69\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.030\nWe can go to Service Health, and what's\nkinda interesting here is we have noticed\n\n70\n00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.050\na couple of intermittent issues over\nthe last couple of days with Office 365.\n\n71\n00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.870\nI mean it affected us here at IT Pro TV\n\n72\n00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.130\nwhere some of our users\ncouldn't even log on.\n\n73\n00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.960\nI know that we had another instance\nyou know of a show running and\n\n74\n00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.660\nOffice 365 was offline.\n\n75\n00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.080\nWell We can actually come in here and\nwe can look at the service health, and\n\n76\n00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.020\nI can see that the portal here,\nOffice 365 portal, right?\n\n77\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.210\nThat's where you login.\n\n78\n00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.800\nI can see with this little exclamation\npoint, means additional information right?\n\n79\n00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.680\nHow do I know that means\nadditional information and\n\n80\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.680\nthat these green check marks\nmeans the status is good?\n\n81\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.390\nWell, they again, kind of make it easy for\n\n82\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.760\nyou, if you wanna know what\nthe different icons I mean,\n\n83\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.870\nyou can get, look right down at the bottom\nof the list, you could say okay,\n\n84\n00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.300\nsomething's going wrong here or services\nrestored or like we could see that.\n\n85\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.610\nToday they're in the middle of restoring\na certain service as we speak, and\n\n86\n00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.600\nthat's that Power BI.\n\n87\n00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.310\nIn fact, they've been having a little\nbit problems over the last week or\n\n88\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.260\nso with that analytical platform that\nthey have, but it looks fairly good that\n\n89\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.720\nthey can, they've seemed to be able\nto restore it fairly quickly here.\n\n90\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.160\n>> Yeah.\nNow an interesting thing about the fact.\n\n91\n00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.690\nWes was talking about how Office 365 Kind\nof was having a little issue the other day\n\n92\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.010\nand we were experiencing those issues.\n\n93\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.380\nWe were unable to get to the site to be\nable to see because what you have to do,\n\n94\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.060\nyou have to login the Office 365 portal to\nactually be able to monitor the health.\n\n95\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.400\nThere is that one of you,\n\n96\n00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.420\nyou know if anyone asking you Well just\ngo to the monitoring page on the portal.\n\n97\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.960\nWell if you can't get to the portal\nyou're not gonna be able to see\n\n98\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.110\nthe monitoring page.\n\n99\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.320\nNow I've heard of people doing this,\nand I think Don has actually done this,\n\n100\n00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.430\nwhere he'll set up a VPN connection or\nuser proxy server in a different region.\n\n101\n00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.140\n>> Yes.\n>> Because usually\n\n102\n00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.010\noutages don't happen-\n>> Worldwide.\n\n103\n00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.890\n>> Company wide, or worldwide, right.\n\n104\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.810\nSo it's happening once a.\n\n105\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.290\nYou can kinda VPN to a different region,\nor use a proxy server to jump over to\n\n106\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.140\nanother region, and then check and\nsee, is that server section running?\n\n107\n00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.410\nAnd then there are websites as\nwell that help monitor whether or\n\n108\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.490\nnot certain business-type websites or\nentertainment websites are up or down.\n\n109\n00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.570\nThat can also help you so\njust not part of the exam but\n\n110\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.120\njust to help you out there in real life\nland, you are trying to practically work\n\n111\n00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.030\nout some monitoring, see if things are up\noor down, that could help you out.\n\n112\n00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.800\n>> Definitely and\n\n113\n00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.180\nit's really good information to have so\nif we wanted to look and see what was\n\n114\n00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.170\nthe problem, or maybe what they\n>> Think might have been the problem with\n\n115\n00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.490\nall it was 365 the other day, very simple.\n\n116\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.360\nAll we have to do, is click on the little\ninformation icon, little exclamation point\n\n117\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.420\nand we can basically go\nthrough some information,\n\n118\n00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.720\nit says investigating right now, their\nengineers are looking at it then they\n\n119\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.180\nLet us know when the service is restored.\n\n120\n00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.580\nWell, there's additional information\nthat we can gather as well.\n\n121\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.360\nFor instance, maybe you know that,\n\n122\n00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.980\nmaybe you wanna find out if a,\nan update's gonna happen.\n\n123\n00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.370\nWell, there's something known\nas the message center and\n\n124\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.330\nif I want, I can go just scroll\ndown to message center And\n\n125\n00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.290\nthe message center's I think really\nis kind of a cool feature because it\n\n126\n00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.510\ndoesn't necessarily mean that\nthere's a problem with your service.\n\n127\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.440\nIt just let's you know, kind of like we've\nseen with plan maintenance on the Intune\n\n128\n00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.980\nside, that they're gonna take\na portion of the platform and\n\n129\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.080\nmaybe they're gonna do something to it.\n\n130\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.970\nMaybe they're gonna roll out a fix, maybe\nthey're gonna roll out a new feature, and\n\n131\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.150\nthey wanna keep you up to\ndate on what's going on.\n\n132\n00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.010\nLet me give you one that does\nAffect your computers or\n\n133\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.030\naffects your devices, and more\nspecifically, it's Windows Handheld 6.5,\n\n134\n00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:34.130\nbut this is something we have\nto watch out for, right?\n\n135\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.160\nSo if I click this one, and\n\n136\n00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.800\nlat me just kinda give you an idea of some\nof the categories so you can see those.\n\n137\n00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.640\nNotice stay informed,\nwe're just giving you information, right?\n\n138\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.670\nPlan for a change, That might be the one\nthat we wanna pay attention to, but\n\n139\n00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.720\nhere's the one that I really\nwanna look at, prevent or\n\n140\n00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.580\nfix issues, notice it says ensure\n\n141\n00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.980\nthat your device has the latest upgrade to\nprevent issues with the Office365 service.\n\n142\n00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.050\nWell, what are they talking about here?\n\n143\n00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.620\nWell I can find out that if I go into\nthis message center, that we're they're\n\n144\n00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.570\ndoing is they're talking about changing\nthe encryption level from SHA1 to SHA2.\n\n145\n00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.580\nNow, how this has affect us?\n\n146\n00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.355\nWell, if you understand that SHA,\nsecure hashing algorithm for\n\n147\n00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:15.105\nintegrity checks and stuff like that.\n\n148\n00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:17.965\nWe're moving to a larger bit length,\nright.\n\n149\n00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:20.075\nSo SHA1, 160 bits.\n\n150\n00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:22.415\nNow we're going and moving into\nthings like 224 or 256 and 514.\n\n151\n00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:27.035\nNow, I don't want you to worry\ntoo much about the secured\n\n152\n00:08:27.035 --> 00:08:30.845\nhashing algorithm other then to know\nthat when they roll this update or\n\n153\n00:08:30.845 --> 00:08:33.620\nfix out If you've got- and\nthey let you know this, here.\n\n154\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.920\nIf you've got some older devices that\ndon't support higher encryption levels,\n\n155\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.940\nthose devices aren't going\nto be able to connect.\n\n156\n00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.160\nSo that might be something\nthat you have to plan for, and\n\n157\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.580\nthey even tell you that it's\nwindows mobile 6.5, and\n\n158\n00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.600\nthey talk about handheld 6.5,\ntoo, So, it might be a portion.\n\n159\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.240\nWhen you see this, that it's coming out,\nthat they're gonna roll it out, and\n\n160\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.980\nif you happen to have that technology,\nyou might find out that hey,\n\n161\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.590\nmaybe it's time to upgrade to a newer\ntechnology, or a newer platform.\n\n162\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.670\nNot Office 365, but another mobile\nplatform that does support the higher\n\n163\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.820\nlevels of encryption so\nthat this [INAUDIBLE].\n\n164\n00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:12.400\nThis prevention or fix isn't gonna\naffect you and cause any down time.\n\n165\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.240\nSo it is really good to have.\n\n166\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.750\nNow, what about things\nlike service requests?\n\n167\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.040\nIf I do find that there's\na problem in here, and\n\n168\n00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.190\nI want to maybe communicate with somebody,\nAbout that fact.\n\n169\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.470\nWell they also have,\nfor instance, support.\n\n170\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:35.130\nIf I look under the support location\nhere in Office 365, and I decide to,\n\n171\n00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.600\nwe'll go ahead and expand this out,\nnotice that I've got service requests.\n\n172\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.190\nI've got overview, service requests,\nand that customer lock box request.\n\n173\n00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.130\nIf an engineer from Microsoft\nhas to access your data,\n\n174\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.750\nthey're gonna contact you, and that's\nwhere you would see something like that,\n\n175\n00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.700\nbut service requests, I don't have\nany service requests here, but\n\n176\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.700\nif I needed to make one, and I don't wanna\nsend one out to Microsoft that's not real,\n\n177\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.520\nbut I could create a service request here.\n\n178\n00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.150\nAnd one of the great things here,\nCuz they give you some categories.\n\n179\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.450\nRight?\nSo if you ever have to dial in and\n\n180\n00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.860\nyou have to play button\npushing on the phone for\n\n181\n00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.910\na half an hour to get\nto the right category.\n\n182\n00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:11.990\nThey kinda make it a little easier.\n\n183\n00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.410\nSays okay,\nwhat are you requesting service about, and\n\n184\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.490\nyou've got categories to do that as well.\n\n185\n00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:24.140\nNow we can also do this On\nthe Intune side, likewise.\n\n186\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.030\nSo you'll see service requests over here.\n\n187\n00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.880\nAgain, fairly straightforward process and\nif we needed to,\n\n188\n00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.240\nif we needed to fill out a service\nrequest we would have that ability.\n\n189\n00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.070\nIt looks like it's just linking\nme back to an Intune site.\n\n190\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.100\nOr excuse me a TechNet site, and it's\ninteresting because it points us back to\n\n191\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.520\nthe first location that we just looked at.\n\n192\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.730\nIt's saying, if you're gonna requests,\nsome kind of service request in Intune,\n\n193\n00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.860\ngo ahead and fill it out in Office 365,\nbecause remember, consolidation\n\n194\n00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.180\nof the two platforms there, that's\nthe good thing about the integration.\n\n195\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.760\n>> No reason to reinvent the wheel\nhere unless you have to, right?\n\n196\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.570\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n197\n00:10:58.570 --> 00:10:59.450\nExactly it.\n\n198\n00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.350\nNow There's also a way, too,\nthat if you want to manage and\n\n199\n00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.840\nmaintain alerts, you can do that.\n\n200\n00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:10.270\nIn fact, let me get to service help,\nhere, one more time.\n\n201\n00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.490\nLet's go ahead and look at service help.\n\n202\n00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.530\nIf I want, I can configure my phone.\n\n203\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.510\nMy mobile devices, right,\nand it doesn't matter.\n\n204\n00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.680\nYou can do this through any one\nof the major platforms, right?\n\n205\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.940\nApple, Android, Windows Mobile here,\nand I can download the app.\n\n206\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.290\nNow as an administrator\n\n207\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.290\nalong with all the emails that I'm\ngetting when the service goes down.\n\n208\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.620\nNow I get a bunch of emails about\nwhat the problem is with the service.\n\n209\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.360\nSo you can set up Mobile\nalerts if you need to.\n\n210\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.410\nSo if you happen to be traveling, right,\nyou're not in front of a computer right\n\n211\n00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.720\nnow, you're not at the hotel\nof where you're staying,\n\n212\n00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.750\nyou can just pull out your phone, and if\nthere's a problem, you can see that alert.\n\n213\n00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.040\nThat alert's gonna come straight\nto your mobile device and\n\n214\n00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.250\nyou're gonna be aware of what is going on.\n\n215\n00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.630\nSo definitely a good way to keep\nan overall view of your infrastructure.\n\n216\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.810\nOne of the things I showed you\nguys is subscribing to an RSS feed\n\n217\n00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.250\ninside of Microsoft Intune.\n\n218\n00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.820\nLet's go and show you that right here.\n\n219\n00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.030\nWe can do the same thing for\nour service status,\n\n220\n00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.720\nour service health,\ninside of the Office 365,\n\n221\n00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.880\nand then we've shown you both platforms\non how to do this, and it's no different.\n\n222\n00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.430\nThey make it really easy.\n\n223\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:21.760\nTakes you to the traditional\nMicrosoft-based RSS web page.\n\n224\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.810\nSubscribe to this feed,\nputs it right there in my feeds.\n\n225\n00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.400\nOh, and it already exists.\n\n226\n00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.990\nIt's tied to the same thing, there again.\n\n227\n00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.100\nRemember, since I subscribed to\nthe RSS feed inside of InTune,\n\n228\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.920\nit says, well,\nthese are gonna be one in the same, right?\n\n229\n00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:39.020\nSo now I'm already subscribed to Office\n365 And I don't have to subscribe twice,\n\n230\n00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.230\nwhich is even better because now I\ndon't have a hundred RSS feeds for\n\n231\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.950\nthe same platform.\n\n232\n00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.150\n>> Awesome.\nNow is there anything else that we need to\n\n233\n00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:50.230\ncover when it comes to administering or\nworking with Intune or Office 365?\n\n234\n00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:54.450\n>> If we were going for maybe one\nof the higher level certifications,\n\n235\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.380\nthere would be plenty.\n\n236\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.190\nThere would be plenty to go through,\nbut for the MTA exams,\n\n237\n00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.770\none of the things I would know is,\nbe able to identify these locations.\n\n238\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:08.570\nYou don't have to go into, and\nall the individual details.\n\n239\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:12.430\nKnow that some of the technology, some of\nthe locations that we've talked about,\n\n240\n00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.740\nI would be able to recognize them as\nfar as a scenario on the exam, and\n\n241\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.390\nif you can do that,\nI think you're gonna be fine.\n\n242\n00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.870\n>> Awesome, well thank you so much, Wes.\n\n243\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.800\nI know this was a bit of a short episode,\nbut it was really good information that\n\n244\n00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.010\nwe wanted to get in there for you, make\nsure it was available for you as well.\n\n245\n00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.620\nThat being said, it looks like we've come\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n246\n00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.200\n>> That's right.\n\n247\n00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.460\n>> Thank you for joining us Mr. Wes Brian.\n\n248\n00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:30.980\n>> Thank you.\n\n249\n00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.990\n>> And thank you for watching.\n\n250\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.520\nWe're gonna sign off for ITProTV.\n\n251\n00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.080\nBeen your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n252\n00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.740\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n253\n00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.150\n>> And we'll see you

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:17.422\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:21.760\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with our MTA Cloud Fundamentals series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.790\nJoining me in the studio again today\nis none other than my good friend Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.720\nWes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.670\nWes, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.450\nHow you doing today, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.070\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.410\nThank you as always for\nhaving me back here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.420\nWe're gonna be moving on into\nconfiguring cloud services.\n\n13\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.120\nAnd up until this point, what we've been\ntalking about largely is just Office 365.\n\n14\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.490\nAnd well, Microsoft Intune, but\nwe really haven't shown you some of\n\n15\n00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.040\nthe other administrative functionalities\nand features that you can perform, and\n\n16\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.750\nsome of the technologies that you can\nmanage from the Office 365 center.\n\n17\n00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.080\nSee, when we think of Office, I don't know\nabout you, Dan, but one of the things I\n\n18\n00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.940\ninstantly think of is just a line of\nbusiness productivity apps, right?\n\n19\n00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.170\nWell, Office 365 can definitely help you\nmanage those, but it can do that and so\n\n20\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.690\nmuch more.\n\n21\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.550\nAnd that's some of the services that\nwe're gonna take a look at here so\n\n22\n00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.660\nthat you can get an idea for\nthe MTA Cloud Fundamentals.\n\n23\n00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.580\nIf they ask you any questions\nabout some of these services,\n\n24\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.770\nyou'll be able to answer them.\n\n25\n00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.610\nOne of the first ones that we wanna look\nat is, well, something known as Exchange,\n\n26\n00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.690\nExchange Online.\n\n27\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.770\nNow, maybe you've heard of\nExchange before, right?\n\n28\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.090\nThis is the email service,\nand up until Office 365,\n\n29\n00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.050\nit's been an on-premise\nemail technology for us.\n\n30\n00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.200\nBut now, we can integrate this.\n\n31\n00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.488\nI say we integrate it, Microsoft\nhas put it in the cloud there, and\n\n32\n00:01:33.488 --> 00:01:36.661\nwe can pay them to manage things\nlike your Exchange servers, and\n\n33\n00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:40.462\nall we have to do is configure them on\nour end to suit the needs of our company.\n\n34\n00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:44.462\nSo let's show you a little bit\nabout that Exchange software.\n\n35\n00:01:44.462 --> 00:01:49.690\nNow from the Office 365 admin center\nhere down at the bottom left hand side\n\n36\n00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.775\nbefore I even scroll you'll see theres\nthis little Admin section here.\n\n37\n00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:56.795\nWell when we expand that out,\n\n38\n00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:59.025\nthis is where we're gonna\nbe working in this episode.\n\n39\n00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:01.837\nWe're gonna be working with\nsome of these services.\n\n40\n00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:07.046\nOne of the first ones we're gonna look at,\nright here, top of the list, is Exchange.\n\n41\n00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:10.455\nNow what this does is, this takes you to,\nwell, an acronym, right?\n\n42\n00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:14.355\nYou might see documentation,\nthey say the EAC, that's just short for\n\n43\n00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:15.760\nExchange Admin Center.\n\n44\n00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.510\nSo if you go out to TechNet,\nyou're looking up any information,\n\n45\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.750\nmaybe studying it, and you see this\nabbreviation that says you can do this in\n\n46\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.020\noffice 365, or you can see this in EAC,\n\n47\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.570\nwhat they're telling you basically\nit's almost one and the same.\n\n48\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.925\nFrom Office 365 you can launch\nthe Exchange admin center, and\n\n49\n00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:32.095\nthat's what this is right here.\n\n50\n00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:35.015\nNow, there's a few things\nthat you might need to do.\n\n51\n00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:38.195\nAnd, definitely, a couple of things\nthat they call out on the exam.\n\n52\n00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:41.125\nAnd one of the first things they talk\nabout is managing your recipients,\n\n53\n00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:42.940\nand that's what we're gonna look at here.\n\n54\n00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.510\nOne of the first things, mailboxes, right?\n\n55\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.280\nWell, one of the great things is,\nfor the software as a service, and\n\n56\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.500\nlet me differentiate this before\nwe say why this is so beneficial.\n\n57\n00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.440\nIf you think about your on premise\nExchange server, you don't just\n\n58\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.200\nautomatically, just because you joined\nsomebody to an Active Directory domain.\n\n59\n00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.910\nIt doesn't set them up a mailbox,\nit doesn't create that forum.\n\n60\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.910\nDoesn't give them permissions to see any\nof, even use the mail service, right?\n\n61\n00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.750\nAn administrator's gotta go\nin there after the fact, and\n\n62\n00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.300\nthey've gotta create the mailbox.\n\n63\n00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.730\nSo now, not only do we have somebody\nin our Active Directory database,\n\n64\n00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.570\nbut now they've got an email as part of\nthat service, basically, integration.\n\n65\n00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.750\nBut it doesn't happen automatically.\n\n66\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.400\nHere on the other hand,\nnotice when I go to mailboxes.\n\n67\n00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.510\nI already have my users ready to go,\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.180\nYou can see the users that\nwe've been working with.\n\n69\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.600\nSo once you create an identity\nin Office 365, and\n\n70\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.410\nhere's where the benefit comes in, I don't\nhave to go to my Exchange server and\n\n71\n00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.540\nturn around and set up somebody's mailbox.\n\n72\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.630\nWell, to a point, right?\n\n73\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.590\nWe'd still need to do a little\nbit of configuration for it.\n\n74\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.010\nBut for the most part,\nonce I create that identity in Office 365,\n\n75\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.270\nI launch the Exchange admin center.\n\n76\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.740\nAnd, you can see that\nidentity's ready to go here.\n\n77\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.530\nNow there are a couple of\nthings that we can do.\n\n78\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.890\nIf I want to make any modifications or\nmanage the mailbox,\n\n79\n00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.080\nonce the user's name is selected here,\na lot of the icons across these interfaces\n\n80\n00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.510\nare gonna be the same things, and\nthe edit icon is this pencil right here.\n\n81\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.230\nSo, if we choose the pencil,\nIt'll open up another dialogue box here.\n\n82\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.330\nAnd when this dialogue box\nrenders we've got a lot\n\n83\n00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.940\nof different things that we can configure.\n\n84\n00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.280\nNow on the MTA exam,\nthey're not really looking for\n\n85\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.920\nyou to be able to configure every\none of these individual settings.\n\n86\n00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.570\nJust knowing that you can configure them.\n\n87\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.880\nMailbox, usage, contact information,\nyou've got metadata that you can add here.\n\n88\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.350\nYou can add alternate email addresses.\n\n89\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.630\nSo notice that you can manage\nthe recipients mail boxes all from just\n\n90\n00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.878\na little pen or pencils, I would say pen\nbut pencil icon right here on your screen.\n\n91\n00:04:55.878 --> 00:05:00.230\nSome of the other things that you might\nwanna do here inside of your Exchange\n\n92\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.810\nadmin center, and something that they\ndefinitely call out via the objectives,\n\n93\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.000\nis managing shared resources.\n\n94\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.600\nAll right, now, resources\nare an interesting concept because\n\n95\n00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.450\nwhat we usually do when we create\na mailbox right, it's tied to an identity.\n\n96\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.070\nIn this case,\none of the users within my network.\n\n97\n00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.722\nBut what if you have, and\n\n98\n00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:25.462\nwe do have inside of Office 365\nthe ability to have online meetings.\n\n99\n00:05:25.462 --> 00:05:30.754\nSo you wanna assign maybe a mailbox\nto a location specific mailbox right?\n\n100\n00:05:30.754 --> 00:05:32.916\nMaybe I've got a conference room and\nwe've got 10,\n\n101\n00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.800\n20 people coming into\nthis conference room.\n\n102\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.180\nAnd they're gonna have some\nkind of mass conference.\n\n103\n00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.757\nAnd what we want the person that\nhas maybe delegated the meeting, or\n\n104\n00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.644\nwe give the delegation of\nthat meeting to that person,\n\n105\n00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:47.500\nwe want them to be able to request\na mailbox that everybody can use.\n\n106\n00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.080\nAnd it's gonna be based on its location.\n\n107\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.730\nSo we can actually do that here.\n\n108\n00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.920\nWe can create what's\nknown as a room mailbox.\n\n109\n00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.400\nAnd then if somebody's\nrequesting a room for a meeting,\n\n110\n00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.680\nthey can attach within that request,\nthey can attach the room mailbox too.\n\n111\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.080\nAnd then everybody that's in that meeting\ncan all collectively use that mailbox.\n\n112\n00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.650\nRather than having maybe to setup five or\nsix individual emails.\n\n113\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.590\nAnd this can go in your\nglobal address list.\n\n114\n00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.860\nAnd you can see it just like\nall the other emails there.\n\n115\n00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.170\nSo I might do something like this\nwhere I've got a couple of them here.\n\n116\n00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.570\nI might say, conference room and\n\n117\n00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.930\nnotice just remember with\nyour naming convention.\n\n118\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.380\nYou know, follow a naming convention and\nwhatever is going to be relevant for\n\n119\n00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.300\nyour company.\n\n120\n00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.250\nJust try to stick with it because anytime\nwe talk about creating a computer name,\n\n121\n00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.490\ncreating a user name, or any identity.\n\n122\n00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.690\nYou want it to be easily recognizable,\neasily identifiable.\n\n123\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.960\nSo, it's got to be something\nthat your administrators,\n\n124\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.480\nwhen they open the console up,\nthey know what it means.\n\n125\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.920\nSee, I could name this Saturn, right?\n\n126\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.660\nWell I don't really think anybody's going\nto be requesting a meeting on Saturn\n\n127\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.570\nat any point.\n\n128\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.940\nWell, not in the near future,\n\n129\n00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.900\nso it's not going to make much sense\nto the admin that's looking at this.\n\n130\n00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.950\nSo I might say conference room, and\nI might say, I don't know, 4-33.\n\n131\n00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.360\nRight, maybe that's conference\nroom four in building 33.\n\n132\n00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.890\nNow again, that's up to you.\n\n133\n00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.020\nAnd I might wanna go ahead and\nkeep it consistent.\n\n134\n00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.190\nAnd I might say conference room and\nthen maybe do a 4-33\n\n135\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.580\nhere, and that's what's going to be tied\nto the email address that everybody's\n\n136\n00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.890\ngoing to use when this resource is\nrequested inside of a room meeting.\n\n137\n00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.530\nI can put location, maybe we say ITProTV\n\n138\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.080\nhere, and maybe we say building 33, right?\n\n139\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.390\nAnd then what this means here is now\nit's tied to a physical location and\n\n140\n00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.550\nnot an identity.\n\n141\n00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.268\nAnd I could put some more\nmetadata if I want in here.\n\n142\n00:07:47.268 --> 00:07:53.454\nWe can put our good Hollywood phone\nnumbers here and I can set the capacity.\n\n143\n00:07:53.454 --> 00:07:54.876\nAnd choose save.\n\n144\n00:07:54.876 --> 00:07:58.787\nIt will create the mailbox here like I\nsaid I have a couple already, and you can\n\n145\n00:07:58.787 --> 00:08:02.939\nsee them in the background there, and once\nit sets it up now somebody requests that\n\n146\n00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:06.610\nroom we've got a shared mailbox every\nbody shares a single mailbox, and\n\n147\n00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.403\nwe don't have to manage each individual\nmailbox just for maybe a temporary\n\n148\n00:08:10.403 --> 00:08:14.180\nconference that's going on, or\nmaybe you regularly hold conferences.\n\n149\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.860\nMaybe out of three or four conference\nrooms and you know every month or so\n\n150\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.730\nyou're gonna have somebody\nneed to request that room,\n\n151\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.280\nand they're gonna need to be\nable to share emails and stuff.\n\n152\n00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.400\nSo you don't wanna have to, like Dan said\nearlier you know, go back and re-invent\n\n153\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.510\nthe wheel any time you need to send emails\nthrough some kind of conference room, and\n\n154\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.890\nnow I've got a couple of em here.\n\n155\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.630\nLooks like I actually deviated a little\nbit from my naming convention so\n\n156\n00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.000\nLooks like my OCD's gonna kick in here,\nand\n\n157\n00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.200\nI think I do wanna fix that, and one of\nthe great things is, hope I can fix it,\n\n158\n00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.890\nI might not be able to\nfix it after the fact.\n\n159\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.180\nNope, it's not gonna let me fix it.\n\n160\n00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.119\nSo, case in point,\nbe careful with your naming system there.\n\n161\n00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.010\nNow the next thing we have are contacts,\nand with contacts, these are for\n\n162\n00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.460\npeople that are outside of your company,\nright.\n\n163\n00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.750\nYou might want to,\nmaybe you work with third-party,\n\n164\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.270\nmaybe some kind of distributor or\nsome kind of vendor, and\n\n165\n00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:15.820\nyou want to have it show up inside\nof your email infrastructure.\n\n166\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.750\nWell I can go to contacts here,\nAnd you can see that I've got\n\n167\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.090\na couple of them here, right,\nmajor distributor, parts manufacturer.\n\n168\n00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.150\nWell I can also create\nan additional contact here, and\n\n169\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.470\nI could say, we got parts manufacturer,\nmaybe we just got vendor.\n\n170\n00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.445\nWe'll just keep it generic.\n\n171\n00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:34.055\nGeneric here, and\nwe'll say Vendor Initials.\n\n172\n00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:36.815\nI'm gonna leave the display name,\nand the alias.\n\n173\n00:09:36.815 --> 00:09:41.115\nNow be careful too with the alias because\nthe alias is directly a tie to what\n\n174\n00:09:41.115 --> 00:09:45.775\nthe external email address is gonna\nlook like when you're sending emails.\n\n175\n00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:53.180\nSo I'm gonna do vendor, and\nwe'll do @ Spacerooster.net and\n\n176\n00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.550\nwe'll choose save, and\nwhen we do this we now have an external\n\n177\n00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.570\ncontact which might be\nsomething that you want to do.\n\n178\n00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:09.020\nNow the other concept that you should be\naware of for the exam is creating groups.\n\n179\n00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.600\nNow I'm gonna show you one of them that\nhas been a traditional way that we create\n\n180\n00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.805\nthe type of groups Group I should say,\ninside of email system, right?\n\n181\n00:10:16.805 --> 00:10:18.345\nThat's called a distribution list, right?\n\n182\n00:10:18.345 --> 00:10:23.945\nA distribution list is where you could\nput a certain group of people on a single\n\n183\n00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:28.430\nlist, that if you send out an email blast,\nit goes out to everybody In that team.\n\n184\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.710\nFor instance, sales teams,\ndev teams, if you have managers,\n\n185\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.120\nmaybe, marketing, and I know sometimes\nthe lines blur between the roles,\n\n186\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.305\nbut I can send out one email and it goes\nout to everybody on the distribution list,\n\n187\n00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:41.730\nathat's one of the traditional ways.\n\n188\n00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.980\nSo we can go over to groups.\n\n189\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.580\nYou can see I've got a couple\nof groups already set here, Dan.\n\n190\n00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.270\nI've got dev team and I've got managers.\n\n191\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:55.440\nMaybe I wanna set another distribution\ngroup, and we can call this ITProTV,\n\n192\n00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.910\nand maybe we just call it Sales.\n\n193\n00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.050\nAll right, and\nthis is where the alias does,\n\n194\n00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.160\nI believe set the name to the group here.\n\n195\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.980\nSo, let me go ahead, and\nI'll call that sales.\n\n196\n00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.310\nAnd there we go.\nWhen we click it,\n\n197\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.690\nit's directly tied to the email.\n\n198\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.460\nNow when you're creating one of\nthese distribution groups like this,\n\n199\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.880\nyou have to have an owner, and by default,\nyour tenant administrator becomes\n\n200\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.000\nthe owner of the group, and the owner\nof the group's the one that manages and\n\n201\n00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.180\ndelegates, and so\nif I have a global administrator,\n\n202\n00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.730\nI could always put the,really, you could\nput anybody, any owner of the group, and\n\n203\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.560\nthen they can manage it, and\nthat's really up to you, and\n\n204\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.090\nwhen we create it,\nnow we've got a few distribution groups.\n\n205\n00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.170\nNow, I'll tell you one thing\nthat's a little bit new here, and\n\n206\n00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.790\nI'd really like to show you this, and\njust in case it comes up on the exam\n\n207\n00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.300\nIs there's another way that you can\ncreate a newer type of group, and\n\n208\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.370\nthat's actually straight out\nof Outlook itself online.\n\n209\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:56.390\nSo notice I'm gonna be navigating\naway from the admin tile here, and\n\n210\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.900\nI'm going to be going right to mail.\n\n211\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.910\nSo that's gong to take\nme directly to outlook.\n\n212\n00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:04.030\nIt takes me out of the admin page,\nwith this, this is kind of cool here,\n\n213\n00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.240\nand personally, I'll tell you what,\nI really like this concept.\n\n214\n00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.530\nNotice that I have a group down here.\n\n215\n00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.990\nWe've already got a group\nthat I've created, so\n\n216\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.260\nyou can see one that's here beforehand.\n\n217\n00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.250\nNow, I'm going to go ahead and\ncreate another group, so\n\n218\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.680\nyou can kind of see what's going on here,\nand one of the best benefits.\n\n219\n00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.990\nSee, the distribution group is a way I can\nsend an e-mail blast out to everybody.\n\n220\n00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.190\nThis group here can do a lot more.\n\n221\n00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.580\nIt ties in with SharePoint and\nOutlook to do a lot more.\n\n222\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.460\nSo maybe we've got Admins.\n\n223\n00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.990\nAll right, and you can notice\nthat the Group ID is directly\n\n224\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.970\nrelated to what you've\ntyped into the group name.\n\n225\n00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.070\nYou can modify it, but\nI'm not going to, and description,\n\n226\n00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.920\nwell we'll just put admins.\n\n227\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.980\n>> Now Wes, really quickly,\nif you're not an Exchange administrator or\n\n228\n00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.630\nsome sort of level admin\ninside of Office 365,\n\n229\n00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.550\nwhen you create a group inside of Outlook,\ndoes that show up in Exchange, or\n\n230\n00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.490\nis that only for\nthe user that's creating that group?\n\n231\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.050\nIs it like their own personal groups?\n\n232\n00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.390\n>> Well, it depends on membership, and\nwe're gonna see that here in a second.\n\n233\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:06.530\nSo for instance, I could do Public And\nif I do public, that means that anyone\n\n234\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:11.610\ncan see what's inside of this group,\nand I can also subscribe new members.\n\n235\n00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.870\nI can make this private, and\nnow it's going to be myself.\n\n236\n00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.070\nI'm the only one, as the creator of\nthis group, who can add anybody.\n\n237\n00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.950\nAt the same time, the people that are in\nthe group are the only ones that can see\n\n238\n00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.740\nthe information that's\ngoing to come up here.\n\n239\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.120\nLike I said,\nI really like this feature here.\n\n240\n00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.370\nSo we'll scroll down.\n\n241\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.110\n>> So if you do public,\nit shows up in the global address space?\n\n242\n00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.370\n>> They yes, and the information\nalso shows up on SharePoint too.\n\n243\n00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.630\nSo it goes a little bit farther than\njust your basic distribution list which\n\n244\n00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.480\ntraditionally has been\non your email servers.\n\n245\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.600\nIt's in your Active Directory, but for\n\n246\n00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.790\nthe most part your admins see it\nup there on the Exchange Server.\n\n247\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.480\nNow I can add people as I want.\n\n248\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:56.700\nSo we'll add old Janice here, and it adds\nthe members, and then it creates it.\n\n249\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.820\nAll right, now it takes\na little bit to create it, but\n\n250\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.880\nwhat's really cool about this is notice\nthat we don't just get the ability to send\n\n251\n00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.890\nAn email to a person in this group, right?\n\n252\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.060\nWe get conversations that we can start,\nmaybe again, we're a development team and\n\n253\n00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.720\nwe wanna have ideas that everybody\ncan see that's in the team.\n\n254\n00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.260\nWell, I don't wanna have to send emails\nout to everyone individually, so\n\n255\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.170\nI post a comment here and\n\n256\n00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:22.370\neverybody sees it that's in this group\nWe have a shared calendar, right?\n\n257\n00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:26.370\nSo maybe when we have a project that's\ngoing on, and we wanna make sure that\n\n258\n00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.530\neverybody knows what the expectations are,\nand what days within that project.\n\n259\n00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:35.140\nWe can see it right here, and\nnotice, everybody's gonna see it.\n\n260\n00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.679\nNow, since I'm a member of the dev group,\n\n261\n00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.450\nAnd the admin group,\nin this case, the user is,\n\n262\n00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.770\nnotice that I can see my personal\ncalendar, I can see this group's calendar,\n\n263\n00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.060\nthe dev calendar, and now the admin\ncalendar that I've just added myself to.\n\n264\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.850\nNow, I'm not really going to really\nclick on files, and let me tell you why.\n\n265\n00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.470\nIt takes a second,\n\n266\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.400\nSharePoint is still setting this up in\nthe background, let's see how fast it is.\n\n267\n00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.890\nIt'll probably say giving this time.\n\n268\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.650\nYep, we're setting it up.\n\n269\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:06.210\nSo It's gotta create it inside of\nSharePoint, but now the great thing is,\n\n270\n00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.130\nlet's say that Dan and I are both in this\ndev team, and Dan says, you know what,\n\n271\n00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.320\nI've just finished this project.\n\n272\n00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.400\nI need to give you this file.\n\n273\n00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:16.370\nWell, he'd have to attach it and\nhe'd have a, maybe dial in\n\n274\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:22.010\neverybody's address, email address\nin the to field, right Not that way.\n\n275\n00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.801\nHere in the group, if he's part of it,\nhe post it to this group,\n\n276\n00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:29.473\nit stores it in SharePoint, and\neverybody can see that work.\n\n277\n00:15:29.473 --> 00:15:33.559\nSo it's really good for collaboration,\nright, and that's really\n\n278\n00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:38.420\nwhat SharePoint's about here, but this is\na newer type of group that is a really,\n\n279\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.788\nreally good way that you can have\neverybody come together, share ideas,\n\n280\n00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:46.780\nsee the same calendars, and\nit makes it very, very efficient.\n\n281\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.215\n>> Yeah, I've had to do my fair share of\nworking with groups, and the exchange and\n\n282\n00:15:50.215 --> 00:15:52.280\ngeneral DId a lot of\nExchange administration.\n\n283\n00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.400\nAnd this is, really,\nthe power behind Office 365.\n\n284\n00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.610\nNow that they have these public and\nprivate groups,\n\n285\n00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.780\nand you can start to\ncollaborate a whole lot easier,\n\n286\n00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.930\nthis is the benefit of going to\nthis type of cloud solution.\n\n287\n00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.200\nNot that you can't download and\n\n288\n00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.530\ninstall and go old fashioned on us,\nbut really the wave of the future.\n\n289\n00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.580\nFor me,\nI'm gonna start learning Office 365.\n\n290\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.290\nExchange inside of Office 365.\n\n291\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.310\nBecause that, in my estimation,\nis gonna be where it goes.\n\n292\n00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.300\n>> Sure, and I know Don is another\none of our hosts here, and\n\n293\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.100\nhe is an expert in Exchange migrations and\nstuff.\n\n294\n00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.940\nI know that you as an administrator\nhave had to deal with\n\n295\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.060\nthe complexities behind it.\n\n296\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.650\nIt's not by any means,\nI'm not saying it's a bad product,\n\n297\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:33.920\nit has nothing to do with that.\n\n298\n00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.664\nIt's just very complex and a lot of\ninfrastructure and it's one of those,\n\n299\n00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:40.590\nthe burdens of IT when you have\nto start doing migrations.\n\n300\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.000\nSo, what better to have something\nthat's already in the cloud,\n\n301\n00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.170\nthat's easy to manage to begin with.\n\n302\n00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.810\nSo, a really good thing to have.\n\n303\n00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.390\nNow one of the other things that\nyou might be wondering, you know,\n\n304\n00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.370\nas far as Exchange Online goes.\n\n305\n00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.410\nYou might say, well, Wes,\nI know inside of our company,\n\n306\n00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:00.600\nwe have things like email spam\nconcentrators, right, to protect.\n\n307\n00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.060\nIt may be on our internet gateway,\nthere may be something host,\n\n308\n00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.764\nrunning on the server itself.\n\n309\n00:17:05.764 --> 00:17:08.040\nWell, now I'm worried about that.\n\n310\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.960\nDo I get that kind of protection since\nI'm using the cloud based solution?\n\n311\n00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.840\nI know we have that on premise because\nI had my hands on the physical device.\n\n312\n00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.860\nI configured it.\n\n313\n00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.040\nDo we have that in the cloud?\n\n314\n00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.640\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n315\n00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.630\nYou can go over here to protection.\n\n316\n00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.270\nAnd you can see, and\nlet me kind of zoom in here for you guys,\n\n317\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.140\nyou can see things like malware filters.\n\n318\n00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.830\nYou can see connection filters and\nspam filters.\n\n319\n00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.480\nSo, for instance,\nif I want to do a malware filter,\n\n320\n00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.820\nI can hit the plus symbol here.\n\n321\n00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.700\nAnd I can define,\nI can do any malware policy.\n\n322\n00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:44.940\nI'm gonna be very, very unique on this one\nand I'm gonna call it AnyMalware Policy.\n\n323\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:50.560\nAnd then I could say well what do\nI want to do with the message?\n\n324\n00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.850\nIf I see that there is detection of\nmalware, do I wanna just discard it?\n\n325\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.850\nI don't even want it to come\nin to the network at all.\n\n326\n00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:56.550\nWe can do that.\n\n327\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.440\nDo I wanna delete the attachments and\nthen alert the user?\n\n328\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.300\nAnd you can see that.\n\n329\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.090\nOr I can have a customized alert that\nsays who you receive an email from.\n\n330\n00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:07.824\nYou might need to stop.\n\n331\n00:18:07.824 --> 00:18:11.032\nNo, we wouldn't do that, but you can\ngo a little bit farther than that, too.\n\n332\n00:18:11.032 --> 00:18:16.157\nI can do notifications to internal\nsenders as well as external senders.\n\n333\n00:18:16.157 --> 00:18:19.779\nAnd we can also make custom\nnotifications and alerts that go from,\n\n334\n00:18:19.779 --> 00:18:23.142\nif it's an undelivered message\nbecause you are blocking it,\n\n335\n00:18:23.142 --> 00:18:25.740\nwe can send like a text message,\nfor instance.\n\n336\n00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.740\nDan's the administrator.\n\n337\n00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.130\nIt sends him a text message and\n\n338\n00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.660\nsays hey, you've got some kind\nof threat that was detected.\n\n339\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.790\nNow, you might say well,\n\n340\n00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.060\nhow would that help Dan out if\nhe received one text message?\n\n341\n00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.400\nWell that one text message\nmight not do him any good.\n\n342\n00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.830\nBut if he sees ten or\n\n343\n00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.270\n15 coming from the same person,\nwell, now we kinda got a trend here.\n\n344\n00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.360\nWe're kind of auditing it, and we can\nmaybe go ask the person what's going on.\n\n345\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.490\nSo, fairly easy to set this up.\n\n346\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:57.820\nI might just do a notification of,\nnotification of that.\n\n347\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.910\nMake sure they're, oh,\nand down at the bottom,\n\n348\n00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.850\nlet me make sure that\nI also point this out.\n\n349\n00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.400\nIf you're gonna make one of\nthe any anti-malware policies,\n\n350\n00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.180\nyou have to add conditions to it.\n\n351\n00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:12.340\nSo, if this is what, all right,\nif the recipient is,\n\n352\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.970\nif the recipient domain is and\nthen could say Recipient Member is.\n\n353\n00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.320\nAnd I'll do a Member.\n\n354\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.700\nAnd then it asks me,\n\n355\n00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.140\nokay well which of these groups in here\ndo you want to add the condition to?\n\n356\n00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.884\nAnd I might do something like sales,\nmaybe, our sales team,\n\n357\n00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:28.324\nwe wanna protect them.\n\n358\n00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:33.510\nAnd we go ahead and choose that.\n\n359\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.810\nAnd now we've got an anti-malware\npolicy ready to go.\n\n360\n00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.110\nOne of the next things that they call out\nis something known as your spam filter.\n\n361\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.670\nNow with your spam filters you can\nalso set spam filter policies as well.\n\n362\n00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.810\nAnd I'm gonna call this\n\n363\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:55.350\nSpam Filter Policy, of course,\ncuz it's creative, right?\n\n364\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.640\nAnd we're gonna talk about, well,\ndo I wanna move this to the junk mail?\n\n365\n00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.950\nAnd depending on the level,\nwe can also do this for\n\n366\n00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:09.130\nmark bulk email as spam, and\nhow long do I wanna retain it for.\n\n367\n00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.990\nAnd once that is set in place.\n\n368\n00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.360\nOh, and let me see, which area did I miss?\n\n369\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.700\nI missed one of the fields here.\n\n370\n00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.600\nOh, and that's the condition again.\n\n371\n00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.280\nYou always have to enter the condition,\ndown at the bottom, and again,\n\n372\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.240\nyou've got to say, well,\nwhat is the criteria, here?\n\n373\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.120\nAnd I'll do the same thing.\n\n374\n00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.890\nMaybe I'll do spam filter, for\nthe Dev team, and you'll probably do this,\n\n375\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.010\nmost likely, for\neverybody in your organization.\n\n376\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:36.450\nI can't see why you would maybe just do\nthis for one team and not do this for\n\n377\n00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.150\nthe rest of the teams that\nyou have within your company.\n\n378\n00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:45.550\nSo, Dan, all very straight forward when\nit comes to, you know, managing Exchange.\n\n379\n00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.890\nAnd there's a lot more you can do\nwith the Exchange admin center.\n\n380\n00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.200\nThose are some of the things that\nthey specifically call out and\n\n381\n00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.315\nsome of the things that I would be aware\nof, if you decide to set the booth and\n\n382\n00:20:55.315 --> 00:20:58.830\nyou're gonna go in and\ntake that MTA cloud fundamentals.\n\n383\n00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.482\n>> Oh, very cool.\n\n384\n00:20:59.482 --> 00:21:02.490\nNow, Wes, I know we got a whole lot\nmore features we wanna go over.\n\n385\n00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.630\nWhat's the next item off our lists?\n\n386\n00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.630\n>> That's right and\nthis one is about collaboration.\n\n387\n00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.050\nMaybe you haven't heard about this before.\n\n388\n00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.520\nThis is called SharePoint.\n\n389\n00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.400\nNow SharePoint, when it comes down to it,\n\n390\n00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.630\nreally I want you to get your\nmind into team collaboration and\n\n391\n00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:23.550\nmix that concept up with what you think of\nas an intranet, an intranet site, right.\n\n392\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:27.340\nNow we're gonna see that we can make\nthis available to external users.\n\n393\n00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.450\nBut you don't have to.\n\n394\n00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:32.390\nThis is about your teams being able\nto get together and communicate.\n\n395\n00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.100\nShare files, share ideas,\n\n396\n00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.910\nshare things like newsfeeds and\nhence the name, SharePoint.\n\n397\n00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.280\nSo let's go ahead and we'll look at that.\n\n398\n00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.030\nNow gotta back out of\nthe Exchange admin center and\n\n399\n00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.220\nnow we're gonna go to SharePoint.\n\n400\n00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.320\nNow one of the things that you\nneed to know how to do is to\n\n401\n00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.630\nset up what's known as a Team Site.\n\n402\n00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:58.050\nNow when you do that,\nfairly easy to do this as well.\n\n403\n00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.140\nAll right.\n\n404\n00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.810\nAnd one of the things,\n\n405\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:05.460\nwhen I say fairly easy, you'll see that\nthere's almost like a unified interface.\n\n406\n00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.710\nThere's a consistency, that when you see a\nribbon much like you've seen in the Office\n\n407\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.530\nline of business applications,\nit really doesn't change too much here.\n\n408\n00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:19.660\nSo if I want to create a new site,\nI first have to create a site collection.\n\n409\n00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.330\nRight?\nIt's really about the name space.\n\n410\n00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.450\nAnd once I create that site collection,\n\n411\n00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.960\nthen your users can create their\nown individual sites under it.\n\n412\n00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.510\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and choose New.\n\n413\n00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.770\nAnd this is a private site collection.\n\n414\n00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.500\nAnd by the way,\nthey do call out external sharing.\n\n415\n00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.840\nWe'll show you that here in a second.\n\n416\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.990\nBut by default,\nthey start out as private, right.\n\n417\n00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.790\nThink intranet, not internet,\nnot publicly accessible but\n\n418\n00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.729\nprivately accessible\nthrough the web interface.\n\n419\n00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.660\nAll right.\n\n420\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.755\nAnd the title I might\ncall this Team Site 2.\n\n421\n00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.390\nAll right, and\nthen we're gonna this all one word.\n\n422\n00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.010\nWe'll say teamsite2.\n\n423\n00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.860\nActually I'll just call it team2 cuz I\nthink I already got one called team.\n\n424\n00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.630\nAnd now it gives the ability to choose.\n\n425\n00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.840\nWhat type of site do you wanna create?\n\n426\n00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.660\nAnd what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna create a Team Site.\n\n427\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.580\nAnd we'll set our timezone.\n\n428\n00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.445\nAll right, and then I can select\nthe people that I want to be\n\n429\n00:23:21.445 --> 00:23:24.158\nan administrator over the site.\n\n430\n00:23:24.158 --> 00:23:27.115\nAnd let's see, all users per tenant.\n\n431\n00:23:30.032 --> 00:23:31.408\nAnd I did not find him.\n\n432\n00:23:31.408 --> 00:23:32.760\nLet's see Janice.\n\n433\n00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.720\nIs she in here?\n\n434\n00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.560\nThere and we can add her to that.\n\n435\n00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.190\nAll right, and\nnow she is the manager over the site.\n\n436\n00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.890\nAnd I can set a storage quota here.\n\n437\n00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.286\nI wanted, we need see quotas but\n\n438\n00:23:46.286 --> 00:23:48.935\nI wanna show another place that\nyou could set quotas as well.\n\n439\n00:23:48.935 --> 00:23:51.559\nSo I'm gonna leave this just blank for\nnow and choose OK.\n\n440\n00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:54.199\nOh, it's gonna require\nme to set a disk quota.\n\n441\n00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:57.722\nAll right, we'll do I pity\nthe fool that don't set no quotas.\n\n442\n00:23:57.722 --> 00:23:58.698\n>> That's right.\nThat's right.\n\n443\n00:23:58.698 --> 00:24:00.040\nBetter put your quotas there.\n\n444\n00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.190\nAnd now it's set.\n\n445\n00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:06.210\nNow, I did want to show you the other\nbutton on the ribbon that you can do.\n\n446\n00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.940\nYou can't really see it right now, but\n\n447\n00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.070\nI do have a site that\nwas created beforehand.\n\n448\n00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:16.020\nSo if I decided, hey, that quota\nright there, It's not gonna help me.\n\n449\n00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.710\nI need more, or I need less.\n\n450\n00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.190\nWell, I can go in here and check the site.\n\n451\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.420\nThis one's already been created.\n\n452\n00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.040\nAnd you'll see that that same option\nis right here, Storage Quota.\n\n453\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.020\nThe difference is you're not\nsetting it in the Wizard.\n\n454\n00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.400\nYou can set it here after the fact if\nyou need to come back and do that.\n\n455\n00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.680\nSo we can choose Storage Quota.\n\n456\n00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.890\nAll right, and you can see well, that's\none terabyte storage quota on that site.\n\n457\n00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.830\nI might say, wait a second,\nslow down there, and\n\n458\n00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:46.150\nwe might do something\nlike maybe 500 gigabytes.\n\n459\n00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.950\nAnd then, we can also send\nan email you know, the alerts,\n\n460\n00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:52.330\nsend the alert to the administrator that\nwe just configured, we could say okay.\n\n461\n00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.720\nWhen you're, giving me a percentage there,\n\n462\n00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.410\nwhat would you want to be\nwarned at as far as storage?\n\n463\n00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:02.250\n>> Well I guess it depends on is it\nwarning me when I'm 95% full, or\n\n464\n00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:03.130\nwhen I have 5% less?\n\n465\n00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:07.810\n>> That's right, when it reaches\n80% would mean you have 20% left.\n\n466\n00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.440\n>> Right so which one does it grab?\n\n467\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.120\n>> It grabs, it tells you,\n\n468\n00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.266\nit says when the storage reached 80%,\nwe're gonna send you the email.\n\n469\n00:25:15.266 --> 00:25:16.090\n>> 80% sound good.\n\n470\n00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:17.090\n>> 80% sound good.\n\n471\n00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.480\nAll right, very good.\n\n472\n00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:24.270\nAll right and it also shows you\nwhat's currently being used too.\n\n473\n00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:28.730\nAll right, so we got our 80% in, and\nwe'll go ahead and click save here, and\n\n474\n00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.180\nwe give it a second to save that,\nand there we go.\n\n475\n00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.220\nSo now we've adjusted the quota,\nand we basically\n\n476\n00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:40.940\nset the resource limit that says, hey,\nwhen you get 80% of your storage capacity,\n\n477\n00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.770\nit's gonna fire off an email\nto the administrator.\n\n478\n00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.170\nSo that's good, but\neven though this is more of an intranet,\n\n479\n00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.060\nteam collaboration inside of your company,\n\n480\n00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.240\nit also has the ability that maybe\nyou wanna give some of your external,\n\n481\n00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.950\nmaybe again vendors, or distributors\nneed access to this information as well.\n\n482\n00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:04.180\nWell you can do that, all you have to is\ncheck the site that is in question here.\n\n483\n00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.860\nAnd we can choose sharing.\n\n484\n00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:10.230\nAnd then when the sharing options come up,\nthey give us, you can see, by default.\n\n485\n00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.070\n>> It's private, right?\n\n486\n00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.750\nNobody outside of the organization\ncan see anything.\n\n487\n00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.810\nWe can allow external users who\naccept sharing invitations,\n\n488\n00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:23.110\nbut then they have to turn around and they\nhave to sign in as authenticated users.\n\n489\n00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:27.210\nOr we could say allow sharing\nby using anonymous access links.\n\n490\n00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.499\nThen we'll go ahead and save that.\n\n491\n00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:35.330\nAnd once it gets saved, what we should\nhave here, is the fact that it is going\n\n492\n00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:40.430\nto now allow somebody that is\noutside of my organization,\n\n493\n00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.990\ngo ahead and access this site.\n\n494\n00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.430\nNow what if we wanted to set up a blog,\nand\n\n495\n00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.140\nwe wanted people to be able to\nsubscribe to that type of site?\n\n496\n00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.720\nWell guess what, we can make not only\na team site, but we can also make it where\n\n497\n00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.670\neverybody can see, for instance, the news\nand the information that's going on.\n\n498\n00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:04.170\nSo we'll go ahead and\nnow we'll create a new site collection.\n\n499\n00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.740\nAnd we're gonna call this,\nwe're gonna call this, blog.\n\n500\n00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.530\nRight?\n\n501\n00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:14.740\nAnd I'll just call the end of the site,\nthe name space, their Blog.\n\n502\n00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.980\nI can change this from team site.\n\n503\n00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.510\nNotice there's a couple options, Developer\nSite, Project Site, Community Site.\n\n504\n00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.600\nHere we can set an Administrator.\n\n505\n00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.300\nLet's see, can I set Jimmy there?\n\n506\n00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.991\nNo exact match, no.\n\n507\n00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.370\nThere we go, and we'll set old\nJimmy Hendrix here as the administrator.\n\n508\n00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.510\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nset the storage quota this one, and\n\n509\n00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:45.690\nwe'll start this one out at 500 and\nchoose okay, all right.\n\n510\n00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.310\nNow, just like any other\nblogging system that you have,\n\n511\n00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:52.990\nour team now can set up their own blogs,\nand everybody can see those.\n\n512\n00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:57.840\nOne of the last things you might\nwant to do with your SharePoint,\n\n513\n00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.570\nis set things like resource limits,\nall right?\n\n514\n00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:05.490\nAnd by Default, it's automatic, and\nyou don't have to configure anything.\n\n515\n00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:10.150\nBut if you want to control it manually,\nwhat you can do is you can go down here,\n\n516\n00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:14.779\nwe're still in the SharePoint admin\nconsole by the way, and choose settings.\n\n517\n00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:22.740\nAll right, now notice that we have\nsite collection storage management.\n\n518\n00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.490\nAll right, if this is set to automatic,\nthose resource,\n\n519\n00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.740\nserver resource limits that I'm setting,\nthey would've been grayed out.\n\n520\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.500\nAnd SharePoint would be managing this for\nyou in the background.\n\n521\n00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.620\nMaybe you need a little more flexibility,\n\n522\n00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.810\nand you wanna customize it\non a site by site basis.\n\n523\n00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:43.870\nAll you would change is the radio button\nfrom Automatic to Manual, and you now have\n\n524\n00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:49.210\nthe ability to set that yourself,\nto ensure that whatever your purposes,\n\n525\n00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.230\nwhatever your needs are, it's not just\nsaying hey, I'll figure it out for you.\n\n526\n00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.560\nCuz again, it's about customization or\n\n527\n00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.950\nabout configuring it to\nwhatever your company needs.\n\n528\n00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:59.740\n>> Very, very awesome.\n\n529\n00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.610\nSo obviously they're trying\nto give you some play.\n\n530\n00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.590\nSome leeway.\n\n531\n00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:07.580\nSome ways for you to make it to where it's\ngoing to work for you in your environment.\n\n532\n00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.670\nGive you a little bit of, like Wes was\ntrying to say, either customization or\n\n533\n00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:12.830\nconfiguration.\n\n534\n00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.626\nConfigurization, that's not a word.\n\n535\n00:29:15.626 --> 00:29:16.297\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's good.\n\n536\n00:29:16.297 --> 00:29:19.722\n[CROSSTALK] That's right we love messing\naround with the English language.\n\n537\n00:29:19.722 --> 00:29:20.510\nThat's right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n538\n00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.480\n>> Wesley, I'm looking at our clock here.\n\n539\n00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.320\nWe are just well out of time.\n\n540\n00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.800\nI know you've got some more stuff\nthat we were gonna go over, but\n\n541\n00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.350\nI guess that will have to wait for\npart two.\n\n542\n00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.930\n>> Sounds good.\n>> So, look forward to seeing you there,\n\n543\n00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.910\nand hopefully, we look forward\nto seeing you there as well.\n\n544\n00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.520\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nclose this show down.\n\n545\n00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.490\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n546\n00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:37.260\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n547\n00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.390\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.250\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we\n\n4\n00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.520\nare continuing on with our cloud\nfundamentals for the MTA exam.\n\n5\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.550\nGoing into a part 2 of configuring\ncloud services is a lot of fun.\n\n6\n00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.400\nJoining me again in the studio\ntoday is my good friend, Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.650\nWes Bryan, to help finish\nthis little topic up for us.\n\n8\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.480\nWes, welcome back to the show,\nhow you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.710\n>> I'm doing great,\nit's great to be here, as always.\n\n10\n00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.190\nAnd that's right, part 2.\n\n11\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.730\nWe couldn't fit everything into\nthe first part of this episode, so\n\n12\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.990\nwe're gonna go ahead and tackle, well,\nnone other than Skype for Business.\n\n13\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.000\nIt is one of the communication\ntechnologies.\n\n14\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.120\nYou might have heard of Lynx before,\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.090\nLynx, prior to Microsoft buying out Skype,\nLynx was their\n\n16\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.400\ninternal communication software, if you're\nstill seeing documentation out there,\n\n17\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.740\nif you're studying for\nthe MTA, Lynx this, Lynx that.\n\n18\n00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.230\nWell, it's been replaced today and\nthe name is Skype, so\n\n19\n00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.855\nit is important to know that.\n\n20\n00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:10.375\nLet's go ahead and dive right in and\nshow you what I'm talking about here.\n\n21\n00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:11.615\nWe have Skype for business.\n\n22\n00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:15.355\nSo we got the Office\n365 Admin center open.\n\n23\n00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:17.965\nAnd, just like all the other services,\n\n24\n00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:20.515\nright under Exchange,\nyou have Skype for Business.\n\n25\n00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:25.921\nAnd this will launch you into\nthe Skype for Business Admin Center.\n\n26\n00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:29.224\nAll right now you're gonna notice\nsomething about all of these interfaces\n\n27\n00:01:29.224 --> 00:01:31.284\nthat we have used up until this point,\nright?\n\n28\n00:01:31.284 --> 00:01:35.562\nThey're all pretty much the same, which is\ngreat because if you get familiar with one\n\n29\n00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:39.440\ninterface, then for the most part\nthe layout doesn't change too much\n\n30\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.083\nas you cross over the different\nservices that you can manage.\n\n31\n00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:45.690\nOne of the first things that we need\nto do is, well manage Skype for\n\n32\n00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.020\nBusiness user options.\n\n33\n00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.660\nSo let's show you how you can do that.\n\n34\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.410\nIf I choose users,\nyou're gonna see there again,\n\n35\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.280\ngotta love that cloud synchronization.\n\n36\n00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.190\nI don't have to create any users here.\n\n37\n00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.810\nI opened it up and my two users\nthat we have created in Office 365.\n\n38\n00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.400\nWell, guess what?\n\n39\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.460\nThey joined us today as well.\n\n40\n00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.260\nSo, not very difficult.\n\n41\n00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.510\nNow, when I select a user right away,\nthis is a little bit different,\n\n42\n00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.230\njust a minor variation.\n\n43\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.180\nNotice that, so far in the interfaces\nthat we've seen, right, Dan,\n\n44\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.880\nthere's usually that little pen icon or\npencil icon right there at the top,\n\n45\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.890\nwell they have it cleverly have it\nover here on the right hand side.\n\n46\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.010\nSo follow the pencil there for\nany editing you have to do in configuring\n\n47\n00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.010\nattributes on your users, and\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n48\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.546\n>> I love Microsoft's consistency\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yes, that's right.\n\n49\n00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:31.690\n>> and\nin place one of their editing tools.\n\n50\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.349\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n51\n00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.894\nthat kind of reminds me of that little\njoke that was going around in the late\n\n52\n00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:38.237\n90s, early 2000s, and it was written and\n\n53\n00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:41.403\nwas just a little VB script that\nyou could get onto your computer.\n\n54\n00:02:41.403 --> 00:02:42.383\nIt wasn't really malware.\n\n55\n00:02:42.383 --> 00:02:44.380\nIt was more grayware.\n\n56\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.740\nThe nuisance or annoying ware.\n\n57\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.950\nAnd there's a little message dialogue box\nthat said how do you keep a moron busy for\n\n58\n00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.480\nhours?\n\n59\n00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.780\nPush okay to find out.\n\n60\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.820\nAnd it would disappear and it would\nreappear on another portion of the screen.\n\n61\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.410\nAnd you just keep pushing okay and\nit would never disappear.\n\n62\n00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.640\nUnfortunately you know which.\n\n63\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.990\n>> You spent three days\non that didn't you.\n\n64\n00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.380\n>> Yeah wash, rinse, repeat.\n\n65\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.530\nUnfortunately nobody ever told me to stop.\n\n66\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.610\nSo.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n67\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.580\n>> You know which boat I'm in.\n\n68\n00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n69\n00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.600\n>> So, what are some of those\nconfigurations that we can do?\n\n70\n00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.180\nWell the options that we can\nconfigure are related to audio only.\n\n71\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.420\nThey're related to audio and\nvideo, and audio and HD video.\n\n72\n00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.130\nAnd you can see, if you wanna record\nconversations, anonymous attendees, and\n\n73\n00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.260\nthen compliance, for instance,\n\n74\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.460\nif you don't want to be archiving any of\nthis information, you can turn that off.\n\n75\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.590\nNow, one of the other things that\nthey call out here on the exam, and\n\n76\n00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.850\nI'm going to show you\ntwo different locations,\n\n77\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.990\njust so whichever one that they ask you on\nthe exam, you'll be prepared for, right?\n\n78\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.280\nWe like to have all those\nbases covered at IT Pro TV.\n\n79\n00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.190\nIf you're doing this on a user by user\nbasis, your external communications.\n\n80\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.380\nWe can allow external Skype for\nBusiness users.\n\n81\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.160\nI can turn this on or\noff and it means exactly,\n\n82\n00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.530\ncan I call for an outside location?\n\n83\n00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.510\nBut that's gonna also be directly\nrelated to your dial and conferencing.\n\n84\n00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.680\nNow, the dial-in conferencing is\nactually the configuration that's\n\n85\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.890\ndone on a user-by-user basis\nversus globally across everybody,\n\n86\n00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.890\nevery one of your users that is\nusing the Skype for Business online.\n\n87\n00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.070\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n88\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.850\nIf you want them to be able to use\nyour traditional PSTN lines right,\n\n89\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.960\nmobile phones, land lines.\n\n90\n00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.920\nWell, you're gonna have to have some\nkind of public phone that they can,\n\n91\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.960\npublic number that they can dial in on.\n\n92\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.560\nAnd that is based on whatever the bridge,\nthe bridge provider is.\n\n93\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.300\nIn this case,\n\n94\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.420\nif you have the E5 subscription,\nMicrosoft is your dial-in provider.\n\n95\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.610\nThey offer that as a service and it's\none of the things that sets the E5 plan\n\n96\n00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.500\napart from the lower tier E3 and\nE1, which doesn't have it at all.\n\n97\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.510\nAnd notice if I choose Microsoft,\n\n98\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.040\nright away it gives me a default number\nbased on whatever my location is.\n\n99\n00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.900\nAnd we can pick some here\nin the United States.\n\n100\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.570\nWe can do Dallas here.\n\n101\n00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.140\nAnd I can do New York city,\nand then I can save this, and\n\n102\n00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.580\nthis becomes what the users can use for\ntheir dial in line.\n\n103\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.860\nYou have to have a toll number and\nyou have to have a toll free number here.\n\n104\n00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.450\nYou can see the conference ID and\nthe pin number, and now you're set.\n\n105\n00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.160\nBut that's a user by user basis, I do want\nto take you back to where you can set this\n\n106\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.350\nglobally and have a globally default dial\nin number based on the bridge provider.\n\n107\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.340\nSo let me go ahead here and, tell you\nwhat, we'll get back to the admin center,\n\n108\n00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.990\nwe're going to kind of jump back and\nforth here.\n\n109\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.090\nSometimes a refresh of the page, it's just\neasier to jump back to the admin center,\n\n110\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.860\nand then jump right back,\nyou can see that 's fairly fast here.\n\n111\n00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.310\nDial in conferencing here,\nnotice the bridge settings.\n\n112\n00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.870\nThese are the same numbers that\nwe'd just seen in that list.\n\n113\n00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.780\nBut when I set it here,\nit sets it as a default for\n\n114\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.800\nevery one of the users that's inside.\n\n115\n00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.980\nSo I could set that same number here,\n\n116\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.935\nNew York City, if that's what I'm doing,\nprimary language English.\n\n117\n00:05:56.935 --> 00:06:00.365\nSecondary language would be Spanish here,\nand we can configure that.\n\n118\n00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:03.305\nBut that sets it globally for everybody.\n\n119\n00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:06.775\nNow that is something that they\ndefinitely want you to know.\n\n120\n00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:09.505\nThe other thing that they want you\nto know is meeting invitations.\n\n121\n00:06:09.505 --> 00:06:13.015\nRight?\nIf I have a meeting that I want people to\n\n122\n00:06:13.015 --> 00:06:16.520\njoin, do I have a message that\nI want to go out to everybody?\n\n123\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.070\nAnd that's something that we can do,\n\n124\n00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.840\nwe can do URL logo, we can set\nthis information right here, and\n\n125\n00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.600\nif we wanna customize an invitation\nmeeting, we can do that.\n\n126\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.960\nSo all real straightforward process,\n\n127\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.500\nnot too difficult when it comes\nto the invitations itself.\n\n128\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.540\nNow.\n[LAUGH] Another thing that they call out\n\n129\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.510\nis knowing your DNS, all right,\nknowing the DNS configurations for\n\n130\n00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.110\nSkype for Business Online here.\n\n131\n00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.050\nOne of the great things is,\nif you are set up for DNS already, for\n\n132\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.440\nOffice 365, well guess what?\n\n133\n00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.940\nJust like Exchange, I don't have to\nworry about some of these records.\n\n134\n00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.300\nI don't have to go in,\nI don't have to configure them.\n\n135\n00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.820\nThey're already there for me.\n\n136\n00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:03.460\nAnd if I'm using Microsoft and I'm using\ntheir name servers then it's even more so\n\n137\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.740\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n138\n00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.720\nNow if you do want to set this up,\nyou're going to have to set up some SRV\n\n139\n00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.195\nrecords inside of your DNS zone file,\nremember that for the exam.\n\n140\n00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:14.895\nIf they ask you, you know what\nkind of records, if anything,\n\n141\n00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:17.355\nthat they're gonna ask\nyou is an SRV record.\n\n142\n00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:20.215\nAnd remember since it's voice over ID,\n\n143\n00:07:20.215 --> 00:07:23.345\nit's gonna be using that\nsession initiation protocol.\n\n144\n00:07:23.345 --> 00:07:27.922\nSo then when it comes to Skype for\nBusiness Online, like we've seen,\n\n145\n00:07:27.922 --> 00:07:32.332\nit really isn't too difficult once you\nknow where you're going obviously.\n\n146\n00:07:32.332 --> 00:07:33.992\nAnd the other thing too is,\n\n147\n00:07:33.992 --> 00:07:37.732\nthe interfaces, they're really\nmaintaining a consistency here.\n\n148\n00:07:37.732 --> 00:07:40.802\nIt didn't matter if it was Exchange,\nit didn't matter if it was SharePoint.\n\n149\n00:07:40.802 --> 00:07:41.672\nWe can see now,\n\n150\n00:07:41.672 --> 00:07:45.520\nit really doesn't even matter if it\ncomes down to something like Skype.\n\n151\n00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.050\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n152\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.710\nA lot of cool flexibility\nwhen it comes to Office 365.\n\n153\n00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.133\nThey try to make it\nan all-in-one package so\n\n154\n00:07:51.133 --> 00:07:54.770\nthat you're easily moved into\ncloud services with Microsoft, and\n\n155\n00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.491\nthey're probably hoping one day that if\nyou like Office 365, you'll probably even\n\n156\n00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:03.292\nmove into their big dog, the Azure Cloud\nservices that they provide.\n\n157\n00:08:03.292 --> 00:08:07.582\nJust get all your on premises into\nthe cloud, go with Microsoft,\n\n158\n00:08:07.582 --> 00:08:13.150\nthat's what they want, and really they\nare making it hard to resist that pull.\n\n159\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.030\nThat being said, to get our feet wet,\nwe kind of mentioned Azure there.\n\n160\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.480\nI brought that up, and\n\n161\n00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.430\nthere's another thing called\nMicrosoft System Center, right?\n\n162\n00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.010\n>> That's right.\n\n163\n00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.740\n>> This is a very popular\npiece of software.\n\n164\n00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.230\nSuper big admin stuff.\n\n165\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.900\nThis is for\nyour top tier admins that are out there.\n\n166\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.510\nBut you might wanna be able\nto get involved with it.\n\n167\n00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.830\nYou might wanna start at least\ndipping your toe into the pool\n\n168\n00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.680\nof the idea of what that means.\n\n169\n00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.990\nIntune is kind of its little brother,\nright?\n\n170\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.730\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n171\n00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.560\n>> And\nthey do call Intune out on your exam.\n\n172\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.110\n>> They absolutely do and that's right.\n\n173\n00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.060\nThis is for\nmanaging those devices that have\n\n174\n00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.550\na couple of restrictions from what we\ncall traditional management, right?\n\n175\n00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.420\nFor one,\nif I've got a device that can connect or\n\n176\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.650\njoin to my domain, not connect to\nmy network, but join to my domain,\n\n177\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.280\nwell then we can manage it through\ntraditional management features, right?\n\n178\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.000\nLike through active directory.\n\n179\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.880\nBut if your device doesn't have\nthat ability or your device,\n\n180\n00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.160\nthe device is already gonna be\nconnected to your internal network,\n\n181\n00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.720\nthen how can you reach out and\nmanage and maintain them?\n\n182\n00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.590\nAnd that is definitely something\nthat you're gonna need to know\n\n183\n00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.620\nwhen it comes to the MTA\ncloud fundamentals.\n\n184\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.860\nAnd what we're gonna show you is\nsomething known as client installation.\n\n185\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.220\nIt is a very important part if\nyou're going to manage the devices.\n\n186\n00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.940\nFirst you have to install what is\nknown as the Microsoft Intune Agent.\n\n187\n00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.500\nAnd it is what manages the communication\nbetween your device and\n\n188\n00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.990\nthe Intune platform, applies updates that\nhave been approved and deployed, policies.\n\n189\n00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.770\nSo that's a great place to start.\n\n190\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.840\nLet's show you how you would do that.\n\n191\n00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.760\nNow, if I want to deploy software,\nyou might look right away,\n\n192\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.310\nand say, well, I don't really see\nanywhere I can deploy anything.\n\n193\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.400\nWell, this is down in the bottom, here.\n\n194\n00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.840\nAnd this is another one in\nthe Microsoft Intune that's under Admin.\n\n195\n00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.300\nAnd when I choose Admin you'll\nsee here on the left hand side,\n\n196\n00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.200\nlet's see here and\nClient Software Download.\n\n197\n00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.700\nThey make it fairly easy to tell\nwhere you should be on that one and\n\n198\n00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.739\nwe can download this.\n\n199\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.480\nAll right,\nnotice it says Download Client Software.\n\n200\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.930\nAnd I'm downloading it right now,\nand I'll go ahead and save that.\n\n201\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.310\nAnd it is recommended to\nsave it to a shared location\n\n202\n00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.630\nif you're gonna deploy\nthis internally first.\n\n203\n00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.540\nMaybe you have some Windows RT tablets and\nthey're inside of your network, right?\n\n204\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.140\nThey can't join the domain, so it doesn't\nmatter if they're connected to your\n\n205\n00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.450\nnetwork on premise or\nthey're anywhere else.\n\n206\n00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.770\nYou won't be able to manage them.\n\n207\n00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.610\nSo, make sure that you have this\nsoftware deployed to a share so\n\n208\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.940\nthose devices can connect to them,\npull them down to the device locally, and\n\n209\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.800\nthey'll be able to install the software.\n\n210\n00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.010\nNow, I've already gone ahead and\nI've got that ready for us.\n\n211\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.230\nJust gotta switch on over here and\nmake sure this is the one.\n\n212\n00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.650\nOh, no,\nthat's the one we already got ready.\n\n213\n00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.860\nAnd I've got that shared map drive\nhere where that software is.\n\n214\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.290\nNow, I wanna kinda talk about the software\nfor a second because it's important.\n\n215\n00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.880\nThere are a couple of concepts\nhere that you need to know.\n\n216\n00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.260\nAnd this is a zipped folder.\n\n217\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.600\nAnd let me also be specific on this too.\n\n218\n00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.410\nLet's say Dan's got his\nIntune subscription, right?\n\n219\n00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.040\nThese are unique to each\ninstance of Intune, right?\n\n220\n00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.640\nIf I wanna manage Dan's devices,\n\n221\n00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.540\nall right, I can't through my Intune\ninterface load up software into\n\n222\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.430\nhis devices that he's also gonna\nmanage from his Intune interface.\n\n223\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.420\nWhy is that?\n\n224\n00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.750\nCuz it's gonna be directly tied to,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n225\n00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.010\nextract this folder and I'll show you.\n\n226\n00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.600\nIt's gonna be directly tied to\na certificate that is inside and\n\n227\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.020\nconnected to or\nassociated with the Intune agent setup.\n\n228\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.500\nNow, one of the thing's that's\nkinda cool is, and fairly new.\n\n229\n00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.640\nI say fairly new.\n\n230\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.940\nIt started in Windows 8.1 and up.\n\n231\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.170\nYou no longer need this certificate.\n\n232\n00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.170\nThis certificate used\nto have to be present.\n\n233\n00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.440\nAnd if you were gonna manage the device,\nand if you launched the installer and it\n\n234\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.130\nlooks for that certificate and it doesn't\nfind it then it would stop the install.\n\n235\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.900\nWell, you don't really need\nthe certificate today.\n\n236\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.530\nSo you could just take the MSI file,\nthe application installer and\n\n237\n00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.572\nyou could use that by itself and\nwe'll give it a chance here.\n\n238\n00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:21.510\nWe'll see, I'm gonna pull that\nout of the folder here and\n\n239\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.110\nwhat it's gonna do is it's going to\nconnect right there to the internet and\n\n240\n00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:30.120\nit's gonna say, hey, you know what,\nI don't need the certificate anymore.\n\n241\n00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.380\nIf you don't have that certificate right\nhere, go ahead and just log into office,\n\n242\n00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.880\nor Microsoft Intune, and\nyou're going to prove, by your account,\n\n243\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.600\nthat this must have been something\nthat came from your Intune platform.\n\n244\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.160\nSo that's a good feature.\n\n245\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.830\nNow, I mentioned that, and\nI also wanna mention something else.\n\n246\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:54.350\nYou can automate these installations and\nyou do that through group policy,\n\n247\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.030\nand that'll perfect for devices if\nyou want that can join the domain,\n\n248\n00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.190\na normal ESD or\nelectronic software distribution.\n\n249\n00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.360\nBut if you do that,\nthen to automate the process,\n\n250\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.708\nthe certificate does have to be there.\n\n251\n00:13:06.708 --> 00:13:11.520\nBecause in automation, what's the purpose\nof pulling software that people have to\n\n252\n00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.000\nclick on, and then sign in something\nthat's not automation, right?\n\n253\n00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.030\nThat's a light touch at best.\n\n254\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.810\nIf you're going to deploy this,\nit's an MSI file.\n\n255\n00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.370\nYou can push this out in group policy.\n\n256\n00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.680\nBut then the certificate\ndoes have to be there.\n\n257\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.720\nAnd when we start the installer,\nit's going to look and\n\n258\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.390\nverify that that certificate is present.\n\n259\n00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.720\nAnd you can see right here it finds it.\n\n260\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.180\nIt isn't giving me a hard time.\n\n261\n00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.130\nAnd oh, and you know what?\n\n262\n00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.970\nIt's seeing that I've already moved\nthat out, so just give me one moment.\n\n263\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.250\nI'll show you an easy way to do this.\n\n264\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.330\nIf that happens, that certain\ninstance is looking for it and\n\n265\n00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.880\nit's just on that extracted folder.\n\n266\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.870\nSo if that happens and\n\n267\n00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:54.480\nyou have that problem, notice that all I'm\ndoing is deleting the extracted folder.\n\n268\n00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.330\nIf I go back to the ZIP And\nI extract it one more time,\n\n269\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.170\nand I'll go ahead and close this down,\nand we start the install over.\n\n270\n00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.860\nWe'll try this one more time.\n\n271\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.160\nNotice it didn't give me a hard time.\n\n272\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.390\nSo if that does happen, you got\na little troubleshooting there too.\n\n273\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.160\nIf that does happen, let's say somebody\nsays oh, I moved that folder or\n\n274\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.080\nthat certificate, but I put it back,\nand it doesn't install, that's okay.\n\n275\n00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.530\nIf you're on the phone with them, tell\nthem just delete the extracted folder and\n\n276\n00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.600\nthen, re-extract the zip and if for some\nreason, it kinda resets the instance and\n\n277\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.570\nyou shouldn't have any problem there.\n\n278\n00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:33.690\nSo, we'll go ahead and Dan, it looks\nlike this thing tried to install, right?\n\n279\n00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:38.680\nIt is installing here but, notice it\nsaid completing the Intune setup, right?\n\n280\n00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.689\nWell, I choose finish.\n\n281\n00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.440\nAnd let's see how much\nit finished the set up.\n\n282\n00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.090\nI don't really see the software in here.\n\n283\n00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.625\nSo let me, my head's kinda covering\nthis up here, but down here,\n\n284\n00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:54.995\nit's kinda hard to see there.\n\n285\n00:14:54.995 --> 00:14:58.335\nThere's the installing\nMicrosoft Intune Client Software.\n\n286\n00:14:58.335 --> 00:15:03.235\nSo, it's a click to run technology where\nit means, it's actually streaming this\n\n287\n00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:07.580\napplication down and it's installing\nit vIa your network connection.\n\n288\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.430\nAnd we can actually take a look at that.\n\n289\n00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.110\nIf you notice, here,\nI've got the same file, as a folder,\n\n290\n00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.460\nexcuse me, and that's got to be\nconsistent with deploying your client.\n\n291\n00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.130\nIt's got to be the same certificate,\nthe same MSI file,\n\n292\n00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:24.520\nbecause it's directly tired to\nyour instance of Microsoft Intune.\n\n293\n00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.380\nAnd if I go down here to the bottom,\n\n294\n00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.920\nI can see that the Microsoft Intune\nsoftware is there.\n\n295\n00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.320\nAnd if I was to right click on\nthis I can see, well here we go.\n\n296\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.200\nWe have deployed the Intune software and\nif I wanted,\n\n297\n00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.780\nyou could see that it's already deploying\nupdates for us, so we're ready to go.\n\n298\n00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.770\nWe've got endpoint protection,\nwe've also go the company portal.\n\n299\n00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.735\nNow we'll talk about some of those other\nfeatures inside another series here\n\n300\n00:15:48.735 --> 00:15:52.761\ncuz keep in mind what they just want you\nto know, they don't want you on this MTA\n\n301\n00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:55.883\nexam to be able to configure\nall these individual settings.\n\n302\n00:15:55.883 --> 00:16:00.413\nBut they do want you to know The ins and\nouts about the installation.\n\n303\n00:16:00.413 --> 00:16:05.333\nSo remember the certificate, know that\nthere is something new in Windows 8.1 and\n\n304\n00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:09.489\nabove that if the certificate is or\nisn't there, when you click on it,\n\n305\n00:16:09.489 --> 00:16:12.770\nit will connect out to\nMicrosoft Intune online for you.\n\n306\n00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:18.360\nYou type in the username of\na valid user and it will install.\n\n307\n00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.090\nNow that does bring me\nto one point though.\n\n308\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.430\nThe user even though\nyou connect them to and\n\n309\n00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.425\nyou connect the Microsoft into then\ngenres that use your account control?\n\n310\n00:16:28.425 --> 00:16:32.690\n>> I did yeah, it's asking you hey,\ndo you really wanna do this kind of thing?\n\n311\n00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.430\n>> That's absolutely correct,\nso be careful.\n\n312\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.770\nJust because you have a valid\naccount inside of Intune,\n\n313\n00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.000\nyou still need to be the local\nadministrator on the machine.\n\n314\n00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.790\nSo if you're not the local administrator,\n\n315\n00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.670\ndoesn't matter if you have\nan account in Intune.\n\n316\n00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.540\nIt's gonna block out you, the user account\ncontrol is gonna block that access.\n\n317\n00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:53.510\nSo that might be something that maybe\ncauses more of a help desk ticket than you\n\n318\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.040\nwant to deal with.\n\n319\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.620\nNow so what's the end result,\nwhat do we see back here in Intune?\n\n320\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.900\nwell I can come back up here and\nif I go to Groups, groups are a little bit\n\n321\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.640\ndifferent remember in Intune what we're\ndoing is we are managing devices, it's not\n\n322\n00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.820\nreally about managing your users other\nthan the fact than you take a user and\n\n323\n00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.440\nlink them to a device and then they\nare now associated with the device.\n\n324\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.660\nIf I wanna find the computers,\nfairly easy to do.\n\n325\n00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.080\nWe can find mobile devices,\nwe can find workstations.\n\n326\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.180\nWhat I have is a couple\nof workstations here.\n\n327\n00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:30.200\nAnd in general it tells me hey there is\nstill a pending update that I've got to,\n\n328\n00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.570\nI need to approve it before it can happen.\n\n329\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.340\nBut then when I wanna do it, again try to\nzoom in to make it a little easier for\n\n330\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.350\nyou guys to see there.\n\n331\n00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.560\nI've got the devices, right?\n\n332\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.650\nAnd I can click on Devices And it takes\na second here to refresh the page.\n\n333\n00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.280\nAnd now, I can see, I've got my\nWindows 10 test here and I've got the,\n\n334\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.310\napparently, I didn't rename this when\nI installed the operating system,\n\n335\n00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.980\nso lovely naming convention there,\ndesktop, blah, blah, blah.\n\n336\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.930\nSo-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n337\n00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.300\n>> Make sure that you rename your\n\n338\n00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.750\ncomputers before you join them to\nWindows Intune, or you'll have a mess and\n\n339\n00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.070\na nightmare of a naming convention.\n\n340\n00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:10.650\nNow, some of the other things that they\ncall out on the MTA exam is creating and\n\n341\n00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.270\ndeploying policies.\n\n342\n00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.850\nNow, this really isn't too difficult.\n\n343\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.190\nIn fact, we've kinda briefly touched\non deploying the policies here.\n\n344\n00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.400\nBut this is another section in here.\n\n345\n00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.740\nIt's under policies.\n\n346\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.760\nAll right.\n\n347\n00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.270\nAnd when we select this-\n>> Now Wes, what exactly is a policy?\n\n348\n00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.440\n>> Very good, good question there.\n\n349\n00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.630\nSo let's look at what we\nwould do on premise, right?\n\n350\n00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:37.750\nIf we're on-premise we would use something\nlike group policy objects, GPOs, and\n\n351\n00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.430\nwhat are these?\n\n352\n00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:44.410\nThose are objects in your directory\nservice that configure settings.\n\n353\n00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.660\nSettings for users,\nsettings for computers.\n\n354\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.990\nNow we're not configuring users here so\nthis is a little bit different.\n\n355\n00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.590\nRemember that the point of these policies\n\n356\n00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.440\nare the fact that you can't\ncontrol them through GPOs.\n\n357\n00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.990\nSo what this does is it kind\nof bridges the gap between\n\n358\n00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.180\nthe traditional management system\nthat we would use on premise and\n\n359\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.740\nsomething that we can use across\nthe internet to devices that\n\n360\n00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.910\nfirst aren't going to be inside\nof our Active Directory domain.\n\n361\n00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.650\nOr even more so\n\n362\n00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:12.200\nhave a limitation that they can't join\nthe domain even if they are on premise.\n\n363\n00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.140\nAnd great question too.\n\n364\n00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.500\nSo I can go in here and\nthere's different types of policies.\n\n365\n00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.240\nCompliance policies,\nI'm not going to worry about them too much\n\n366\n00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.830\nbecause these are ways that you can\ncontrol things like Samsung devices.\n\n367\n00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.570\nThese aren't for your Windows devices.\n\n368\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.570\nBut what we want\nare configuration policies.\n\n369\n00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.870\nAnd the configuration policies can\nconfigure a lot of different things and\n\n370\n00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.560\na lot of different devices.\n\n371\n00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.240\nSo for instance, one of the reasons\nit's no longer named Windows Intune,\n\n372\n00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.070\nbecause it was kind of confusing,\nwe got Windows Intune.\n\n373\n00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.320\nSo, it manages just windows, right?\n\n374\n00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.140\nNo, it manages a lot of different devices,\nyou can see even Mac is in here as well.\n\n375\n00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.640\nSo, we're going to open Windows.\n\n376\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.580\nAll right.\n\n377\n00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.150\nAnd we're kinda reiterate on something\nthat I had mentioned before.\n\n378\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.600\nYou have to pay attention to the policies\n\n379\n00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.500\nbecause the policies tell you what\noperating system is supported.\n\n380\n00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.270\nAnd notice that some of these\nare specific to Windows 10, right,\n\n381\n00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.590\nthey don;t say Windows 8.1 or later so\nyou have to be careful with that.\n\n382\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.690\nSo the other thing I want you to know too\nis pay attention to whether it's mobile\n\n383\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:15.230\nor not, right?\n\n384\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.030\nYou can see that this is Windows 10.\n\n385\n00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.740\nAnd you'll see it now that I zoom in here.\n\n386\n00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.620\nNotice it says desktop and mobile.\n\n387\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.140\nBut notice that this says phone only,\nright.\n\n388\n00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.490\nSo pay attention.\n\n389\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.032\nAre you doing MDM?\n\n390\n00:20:27.032 --> 00:20:28.766\nMobile device management?\n\n391\n00:20:28.766 --> 00:20:33.720\nIf you're doing mobile device management,\nthen this'll work with the phones.\n\n392\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.330\nIf you're looking for\nsomething that's desktop and mobile,\n\n393\n00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.330\nyou have to pay attention to\nthe policy that you're gonna implement.\n\n394\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.450\nSo we'll go ahead and create the policy.\n\n395\n00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.530\nSome of the policies We'll give you\na template, and they'll say hey,\n\n396\n00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.520\nit's kinda like a best practice analysis.\n\n397\n00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.730\nThis is some of the common settings that\nwe've seen, and we'll make it easier for\n\n398\n00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.880\nyou, and we'll just have a template.\n\n399\n00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.500\nAnd if you want, it puts the template\nin place and you can come back and\n\n400\n00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.470\nmake some modifications to it.\n\n401\n00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.160\nThis one, obviously, as you can see,\nthe radio button's grayed out.\n\n402\n00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.460\nIt doesn't come with a template.\n\n403\n00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.431\nSo, we'll go ahead and create this policy.\n\n404\n00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:12.260\nAll right, now it sets\nthe policy up to be configured.\n\n405\n00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.920\nWe actually haven't created it,\nit's kind of like a list that says,\n\n406\n00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.265\nall right, what type of policy\nare you looking for first.\n\n407\n00:21:20.265 --> 00:21:24.915\nFor instance, when I find a group\npolicy inside of Active Directory,\n\n408\n00:21:24.915 --> 00:21:27.445\nI found the policy setting, but\nI still haven't configured it.\n\n409\n00:21:27.445 --> 00:21:29.745\nSo that's one of the things\nthat we have to do here.\n\n410\n00:21:29.745 --> 00:21:34.586\nSo we'll call this My Policy.\n\n411\n00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:37.625\nAnd this is something kinda interesting.\n\n412\n00:21:37.625 --> 00:21:44.350\nNow if I scroll here, Dan, and I keep\nscrolling It looks like I'm still where?\n\n413\n00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:44.990\n>> In the general.\n\n414\n00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.900\n>> In the general location.\n\n415\n00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.360\nNow watch this, if I scroll all the way\nback up and I go to Security and\n\n416\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.530\nCloud, it's just scrolling.\n\n417\n00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.260\nIt's just taking me to\nthe different locations.\n\n418\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.390\nSo don't let that confuse\nyou out there guys.\n\n419\n00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.660\nIf you see me scrolling here, well,\nwhat we got here are applications.\n\n420\n00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.450\nAnd that's a category in this list.\n\n421\n00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.650\nSo I could say,\nallow web browser not configured.\n\n422\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.770\nI could turn this on and say, allow the\nweb browser, and this is for mobile only.\n\n423\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.320\nAnd that's one of the great things I\nlove about the Intune platform here.\n\n424\n00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.740\nIf you're not sure what a setting does,\nsee the information bar here,\n\n425\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.700\nour little information icon?\n\n426\n00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.830\nIt gives you, just like the explain\ntab does in a group policy object,\n\n427\n00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.660\nwhere if you don't know what the setting\ndoes, you hit the explain tab,\n\n428\n00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.570\nit gives you the dissertation, or\nexplanation I should say, on what it does.\n\n429\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.880\nSo if you're not sure,\nalways check it out.\n\n430\n00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.960\nRemember that some of these,\nwhen you turn it on,\n\n431\n00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.990\ndoesn't necessarily mean it enforces it.\n\n432\n00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.560\nNotice it says, Require a password\nto unlock devices, and I said No.\n\n433\n00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.756\nWell, by default, if it's disabled, right,\n\n434\n00:22:45.756 --> 00:22:49.230\nwell then I don't care about it.\n\n435\n00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.470\nSo just be careful there.\n\n436\n00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.180\nAnd what I can do is, I'll turn this\none on, and I'll save the policy.\n\n437\n00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.380\nAll right, and now this is the point\nwhere it deploys the policy.\n\n438\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.500\nAnd what happens here is there's a\ncommunication between the Intune platform\n\n439\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.980\nand the agent you just\nseen us install there.\n\n440\n00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.220\nAnd what's going to happen is at\nthe next update, it's gonna look for\n\n441\n00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.380\na couple things, the agent is.\n\n442\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.530\nOne of the things the agent is gonna\nlook for is are there any updates.\n\n443\n00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.700\nAnd then it's also going to look for\n\n444\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.540\nthose policies, and it'll pull those\npolicies down, and it will configure them.\n\n445\n00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.970\nNow inside of an on premise\nActive Directory solution, right,\n\n446\n00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.690\nwe do those with something called CSEs on\nthe computers, the Client Side Extensions.\n\n447\n00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.180\nThey're what connect to\nthe domain controller and\n\n448\n00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.430\nsay hey, are those policy settings there?\n\n449\n00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.470\nDo I need to make any\nconfiguration changes?\n\n450\n00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.380\nAnd if I do, I'm gonna go ahead and\nrifle off and change all the settings\n\n451\n00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.030\naccordingly, according to\nthe policy in Active Directory.\n\n452\n00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.560\nThe agent here in InTune\nis what does that, right?\n\n453\n00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.730\nAlmost the same concept,\nit connects to the Intune platform.\n\n454\n00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.760\nAnd it says are there any new policies\nthat I need to look at and if they do.\n\n455\n00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.800\nHold on a second.\n\n456\n00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.550\nI see a change.\n\n457\n00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:56.250\nLet me go ahead and I'll apply them to\nthe machine, so the machine is compliant.\n\n458\n00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.337\nWe'll go ahead and deploy this.\n\n459\n00:23:57.337 --> 00:23:59.935\nAnd it asks us, well,\nwhat do you want to deploy this?\n\n460\n00:23:59.935 --> 00:24:03.164\nWhat group of devices do\nyou want to Deploy this to.\n\n461\n00:24:03.164 --> 00:24:06.600\nAnd I can select all\ncomputers if I want to,\n\n462\n00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.480\nI can choose OK, and\nit will process the request for me.\n\n463\n00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.990\nSo again another one that isn't really\ntoo difficult when it comes down to it.\n\n464\n00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.400\nNow, I can also set up notifications\nif I want as well, and\n\n465\n00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.380\nthis is through alerts here.\n\n466\n00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.380\nAnd let me mention the dashboard,\n\n467\n00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.650\nthe dashboard sometimes doesn't get\nsome of the recognition that it should.\n\n468\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.870\nNotice the dashboard is\nthe jump link right here and\n\n469\n00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.660\nI can see right away I've got some alerts.\n\n470\n00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:39.840\nSo notice the tile interface, when I\nlog in, I see those alerts right away.\n\n471\n00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.050\nNow if I click ALERTS,\nnotice that here on the left-hand side,\n\n472\n00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.350\ncontextual pane, takes me right\ndown to what I just clicked.\n\n473\n00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.860\nAnd I can see some of the alerts\nif I want to, I can review these,\n\n474\n00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.959\nI can also set them to alert me\nas an administrator if I want.\n\n475\n00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.470\nAll right, and then one of the last things\nI think that you should really know\n\n476\n00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.490\nare some of the different mobile\npolicies that you have here.\n\n477\n00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.778\nAnd when it comes to the mobile policies,\nagain one of the things that I would pay\n\n478\n00:25:07.778 --> 00:25:10.466\nattention to is when you\nlook at these policies and\n\n479\n00:25:10.466 --> 00:25:14.882\nthe policies that you wanna add, find out\nwhich ones are based on mobile devices,\n\n480\n00:25:14.882 --> 00:25:16.808\nmobile operating systems, okay?\n\n481\n00:25:16.808 --> 00:25:21.420\nSo with Windows you really have\nto kinda look, you gotta search.\n\n482\n00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.080\nLike we've seen one setting that was for\nWindows 10 mobile only.\n\n483\n00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.940\nOne that was for Windows phone 8, right?\n\n484\n00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.180\nSo that's mix and\nmingled with the desktops, right,\n\n485\n00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:34.260\nthe work stations as well, client based\noperating systems and not just mobile.\n\n486\n00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.780\nWell it's kinda easy to tell\nif it's an Android device,\n\n487\n00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.490\nit's gonna be some kind of mobile device,\nright?\n\n488\n00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:43.022\nIf it happens to be iOS,\nwell we know that iOS is gonna be what?\n\n489\n00:25:43.022 --> 00:25:46.380\nIt's gonna be an iPhone or\nit's gonna be an iPad.\n\n490\n00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:53.450\nSo we can do mobile policies for what\nthey call MDM, Mobile Device Management.\n\n491\n00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:58.273\nSee the Windows Intune software is based\non an industry wide standard out there\n\n492\n00:25:58.273 --> 00:26:01.721\nthat is maintain by\nthe Open Mobile Alliance, the OMA.\n\n493\n00:26:01.721 --> 00:26:06.511\nAnd it's just a consortium that\nmanages the client server protocol\n\n494\n00:26:06.511 --> 00:26:10.881\ncalled the Open Mobile Device\nManagement Infrastructure and\n\n495\n00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:12.994\nthis falls right under that.\n\n496\n00:26:12.994 --> 00:26:16.963\nSo what you have to do in order to set\nthese policies in place is that whatever\n\n497\n00:26:16.963 --> 00:26:18.223\nthat mobile device is,\n\n498\n00:26:18.223 --> 00:26:22.381\nyou've gotta set Windows Intune as\nthe mobile device management authority,\n\n499\n00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:26.431\nand what you're saying is, I give you\nthe authority to manage this device.\n\n500\n00:26:26.431 --> 00:26:28.869\nBut once that's set up you\ncan deploy these policies,\n\n501\n00:26:28.869 --> 00:26:31.480\nthen you can control your\nmobile devices as well.\n\n502\n00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.400\n>> Awesome.\nWell obviously there's a lot to Intune,\n\n503\n00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.290\nbut it's also, once you get it down, once\nyou understand all of the concepts, all\n\n504\n00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.730\nthe practical ways in which you can use\nit, it can become a very powerful tool.\n\n505\n00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.831\nAnd especially necessary if you're gonna\nbe working in a very blended environment\n\n506\n00:26:45.831 --> 00:26:48.478\nwith devices that are unable\nto be joined to a domain.\n\n507\n00:26:48.478 --> 00:26:49.877\nOr if you don't have a domain, but\n\n508\n00:26:49.877 --> 00:26:53.261\nyou still wanna have some control over the\ncomputers that connect to your network,\n\n509\n00:26:53.261 --> 00:26:56.140\nor devices that connect to your network,\nIntune's the way to go.\n\n510\n00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.810\nSo Wes, a lot of cool information.\n\n511\n00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:58.980\n>> Yeah man.\n>> Is there anything else that we need to\n\n512\n00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.740\nknow about Intune, specifically for\nthis exam or this show?\n\n513\n00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:07.400\n>> No, I would say not, but I would like\nto reiterate what Dan has stated earlier.\n\n514\n00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.710\nWhen it comes down to it, ultimately if\nyou're doing this in an enterprise level\n\n515\n00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.630\nenvironment, he was right,\nthey do want you to integrate this console\n\n516\n00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.820\nwith the System Center\nConfiguration Manager.\n\n517\n00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:19.630\nBut it is not something that you\nhave to worry about on this exam.\n\n518\n00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:24.170\nBut keep that in mind if you're gonna go\non to more of the higher level cloud based\n\n519\n00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.650\ncertifications because you\nmight need to know that fact.\n\n520\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.320\nBut for\nMTA Cloud fundamentals you should be okay.\n\n521\n00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.690\n>> Awesome, well thank you so much for\n\n522\n00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.850\nshowing us this and\nexplaining this out for us.\n\n523\n00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.730\nIntune's not so much of a mystery,\nhopefully, any longer for you.\n\n524\n00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.890\nThat being said, we thank you for\njoining us today.\n\n525\n00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.700\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV,\n\n526\n00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.410\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n527\n00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:42.230\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n528\n00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.606\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

00:00:20.550\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our MTA Cloud Fundamentals.\n\n4\n00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.298\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.298 --> 00:00:24.875\nwe're gonna be going over\nsupporting our cloud users.\n\n6\n00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.640\nOur users are obviously\nimportant part of our business.\n\n7\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.200\nWe've got to make sure that they can\naccess what they need to do their job,\n\n8\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.558\nto make organization money.\n\n9\n00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:35.550\nSo we've gotta be able to help\nthem out when they have trouble\n\n10\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.630\naccessing these cloud services we provide.\n\n11\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.350\nAnd here to help us figure out how\nto do all that is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.140\nHow's it going, Wes?\n\n13\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.080\n>> Oh, it's going great, Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.760\nAs always, thank you for\nhaving me back here.\n\n15\n00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.930\nThat's right, we're gonna be talking\nabout how we can keep those end users\n\n16\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.040\nconnected and if they can't get connected,\n\n17\n00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.740\nsome of the things that we can do to\nfind out maybe what the issue might be.\n\n18\n00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.036\nRemember, that when it comes to\nsupporting your end users, it is a very,\n\n19\n00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:00.548\nvery important thing,\nat least from an IT stand point.\n\n20\n00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:04.610\nAnd up until this point, we've really been\ntalking about, a lot of the fundamentals.\n\n21\n00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.599\nWe've shown you around things like\nExchange Online, SharePoint Online,\n\n22\n00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:09.730\nSkype for Business.\n\n23\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.280\nWell, each one of those has\ntheir own communication channels\n\n24\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.410\neven though it's collectively Office 365.\n\n25\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.070\nAnd there are gonna be some\nsteps that you're gonna take\n\n26\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.550\nto remedy some of the issues\nin each Individual platform.\n\n27\n00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.300\nOne of the first things that we need\nto look at is, well, the sign in right?\n\n28\n00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.710\nDoesn't matter what service we have,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.310\nIf we can't sign in,\ndoesn't matter if have an Exchange set up,\n\n30\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.670\ndoesn't matter if I have SharePoint,\ncertainly not Skype for business, right?\n\n31\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.924\nVoice over IP, everything's gonna\nrevolve around a connection there, so\n\n32\n00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:40.125\nwe gotta start a software as a service.\n\n33\n00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.870\nRemember that our major platform, right,\n\n34\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.960\nour major connectivity application\nis gonna be the web browser.\n\n35\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.980\nSo, we've gotta figure out,\nis it basic network communications or\n\n36\n00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.488\nis the web browser that might have issues.\n\n37\n00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:57.715\nMike, one of the things,\nI know you're very security-centric there.\n\n38\n00:01:57.715 --> 00:01:59.518\nI think of things like firewalls and\n\n39\n00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:03.545\nwe're just gonna kinda show you a way\naround the Windows operating system, and\n\n40\n00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:07.227\nsome of the steps that you can take to\nensure that your users can connect.\n\n41\n00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:10.440\n>> All right, now Wes, I would assume\nthat the first thing that we need to do,\n\n42\n00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.756\nif we're going to sign in to any type of\napplication or a cloud based service,\n\n43\n00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:16.180\nwell, I need to be able to\nget to the logon page, right?\n\n44\n00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.805\nI need somewhere to type in\nmy username and password.\n\n45\n00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.430\nIf I can't get there, then I'm not\ngonna be very successful at logging in.\n\n46\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.580\nSo, let's look at some of the issues\nthat we might have just connecting to\n\n47\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.890\nthe log-on page.\n\n48\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.020\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n49\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.560\nSo one of the first things that\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna look,\n\n50\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.900\nstarting very basic, right, the URL.\n\n51\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.085\nAre you typing the URL right?\n\n52\n00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:37.270\nNow, some of this might\nseem a little simplistic.\n\n53\n00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.749\nBut it's interesting that when\nusers get frustrated it's easy for\n\n54\n00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:41.975\nthem to overlook this.\n\n55\n00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:45.956\nThink about if you've gone to a service,\nwhatever.\n\n56\n00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:49.687\nYou go to a restaurant and you have to\nwait in line forever to get a table, and\n\n57\n00:02:49.687 --> 00:02:51.597\nthen they mess up your order, right?\n\n58\n00:02:51.597 --> 00:02:54.610\nYou start getting frustrated and you can\noverlook some of the simplest things.\n\n59\n00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.230\nSo, you wanna make sure that you're\nalways going to the right location.\n\n60\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.512\nNow, let's go ahead and show you.\n\n61\n00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:06.960\nFairly easy, all I'm gonna do here is\nI'm gonna look up Office 365 login.\n\n62\n00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.525\nAnd when we connect we just make sure\nthat we have the right login page,\n\n63\n00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:14.275\nthe right screen.\n\n64\n00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:17.455\nBecause there's a few different locations,\nand especially as admins,\n\n65\n00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:21.900\nthat we use in order to login\nto our Office 365 platforms.\n\n66\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.403\nSo for instance, right now I can\ntell that I can login to Office 365.\n\n67\n00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:31.127\nSo let's imagine a scenario here,\nMike, where maybe somebody called me,\n\n68\n00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:34.964\none of our users called, we've got\na helpdesk ticketing system, right, and\n\n69\n00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.260\nthey're saying, we can't get connection.\n\n70\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.797\nOr, I can't get connection\ninto the Office 365.\n\n71\n00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:43.320\nWell, what's the first thing\nyou have to do as helpdesk?\n\n72\n00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.480\nOne of the biggest things that we have\nto do is we have to first determine,\n\n73\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.120\ncan we use admins,\ncan we log in Office 365?\n\n74\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.310\nAnd then at this point, if we can,\nnow we gotta start scoping the problem.\n\n75\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.378\nWe gotta figure out were\nthe problem might lie.\n\n76\n00:03:56.378 --> 00:03:59.648\nAnd one of the things that I can think of,\noff the top of my head, Mike,\n\n77\n00:03:59.648 --> 00:04:03.308\nand just some of the basic things are some\nof the services that surround network\n\n78\n00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:06.550\ncommunications, regardless of\nthe platform you're using.\n\n79\n00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.220\n>> Absolutely, right?\n\n80\n00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.700\nWe've gotta be able to\ncommunicate on the network.\n\n81\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.390\nThat means I need the proper\nTCP/IP configuration.\n\n82\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.920\nIf I'm gonna be typing in a URL,\n\n83\n00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.710\nmost likely my end users are not typing\nthe IP address of that login page, right.\n\n84\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:20.330\nThey're using a name.\n\n85\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.088\nSo I need to be able to resolve\nthat name into an IP address, so\n\n86\n00:04:24.088 --> 00:04:26.027\nI can see DNS coming into play.\n\n87\n00:04:26.027 --> 00:04:28.670\nI have to able to get outside\nof whatever network I'm on,\n\n88\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.490\ncuz I'm not sitting on\nMicrosoft's network, right.\n\n89\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.430\nSo I'm on an internal LAN,\nI've gotta have a gateway,\n\n90\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.060\na way to get out to the Internet and\naccess those cloud based services.\n\n91\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.660\nSo these are things that I would\nthink of that would help me\n\n92\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.450\nstart that troubleshooting process.\n\n93\n00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.420\n>> That's right, and one of the things\nthat we do in that troubleshooting process\n\n94\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.580\nis we start locally, right.\n\n95\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.690\nNow see, as an admin myself, I can say,\n\n96\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.880\nwell, I just got logged into Office\n365 and I didn't have a problem.\n\n97\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.999\nBut we gotta think about this.\n\n98\n00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:55.431\nAs software as a service,\n\n99\n00:04:55.431 --> 00:04:59.798\nwe're not really sure where this\ninformation's being sent to login, right.\n\n100\n00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:03.718\nThere's gonna have multiple locations,\nmultiple URLs across the entire world,\n\n101\n00:05:03.718 --> 00:05:07.638\nlet alone just your geographical region,\nlike we're in here, in North America,\n\n102\n00:05:07.638 --> 00:05:11.010\nwhere the majority of the data centers,\nthat we're connected to are.\n\n103\n00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.780\nSo we wanna start very simple.\n\n104\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.790\nFor instance, DNS, Domain Name System.\n\n105\n00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.640\nNow, if you're not familiar with Domain\nName System, just understand that it\n\n106\n00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.830\nis a way that I don't have to\nremember hundreds, if not thousands,\n\n107\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.500\nof IP addresses to all of the websites\nthat we wanna visit across the Internet.\n\n108\n00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.175\nAnd it is one of the most important\nservices for network communications and\n\n109\n00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:34.930\nin ensuring that your end users\ncan maintain connectivity.\n\n110\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.520\nSee, we don't wanna have to write\ndown all of those IP addresses,\n\n111\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.220\nso thank goodness we've got\nthe Domain Name System.\n\n112\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.297\nAnd that Domain Name System just takes any\nname that we type into the web browser.\n\n113\n00:05:44.297 --> 00:05:49.850\nFor instance, just like that HTTPS\nportal.Office365.com, right?\n\n114\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.750\nWell, that's It's just a name.\n\n115\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.633\nAnd the problem is if\nthe DNS isn't working right,\n\n116\n00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:58.440\nit's not gonna take that name and\nit's not gonna map it, right?\n\n117\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.170\nIt's not gonna associate\nit with an IP address.\n\n118\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.445\nAnd when that happens, or I should say,\nwhen that doesn't happen,\n\n119\n00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:07.220\nunfortunately, we're not\ngonna get any connectivity.\n\n120\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.150\nSo let's go ahead and show you some of\nthe things that you can do to ensure\n\n121\n00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.090\nthat your DNS is working properly.\n\n122\n00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.570\nOne of the first things you have to\ndo is make sure that you do have\n\n123\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.160\na DNS server set up.\n\n124\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.540\nNow, there's a couple of different\nways that this can happen.\n\n125\n00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.580\nOne of the first things that I might wanna\nto do is I might wanna look at the TCP/IP\n\n126\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.512\nproperties of the network adapter and\n\n127\n00:06:25.512 --> 00:06:29.397\nverify that I do have an IP address\nthat's gonna use some kind of DNS server.\n\n128\n00:06:29.397 --> 00:06:30.600\nSo we can go ahead and do that, Mike.\n\n129\n00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.047\nHere I'm gonna type my ipconfig /all.\n\n130\n00:06:34.047 --> 00:06:35.950\nAnd one of the first\nthings that I can see, and\n\n131\n00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.467\nI know a lot of information in here.\n\n132\n00:06:37.467 --> 00:06:41.061\nGot a lot of Bluetooth adapters and IPv6\ninformation that you can kind of gloss\n\n133\n00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:44.560\nover, cuz it's not really what\nwe're looking at, at this point.\n\n134\n00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.640\nBut what we really do wanna\nsee is do I have a DNS server?\n\n135\n00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.290\nNow I can see I have a DNS server here,\nMike, but it's an interesting DNS server,\n\n136\n00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.610\nfor that matter.\n\n137\n00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.410\nIf you'll notice that I also\nhave a default gateway.\n\n138\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.970\nRemember, Mike mentioned that default\ngateway, and that's gonna be important.\n\n139\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.250\nRemember, when in basic\nTCPIP communications,\n\n140\n00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.990\nyou can communicate on your local network\nwithout having anything like a router\n\n141\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.800\nto send communications\nacross the Internet.\n\n142\n00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.880\nAll right, but the problem is even\nif I'm not sending information\n\n143\n00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.710\nto a default gateway, then I can't\ncommunicate past the Internet.\n\n144\n00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.090\nSo one of the things I can see, here,\nis it's kinda interesting, that my DHCP\n\n145\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:30.300\nserver, my WINS server,\nmy DNS server, it's on my gateway.\n\n146\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.410\nThe same IP address to the gateway.\n\n147\n00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.610\nSo what does that mean,\nif I've got one IP address for\n\n148\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.260\nall these different technologies?\n\n149\n00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.553\nThen it typically means\nthat probably my router,\n\n150\n00:07:39.553 --> 00:07:42.953\nthat I'm sending the information to,\nis doing a few things for me right?\n\n151\n00:07:42.953 --> 00:07:47.948\nNot only is it making sure that I have\nan IP address, not only is it making sure\n\n152\n00:07:47.948 --> 00:07:52.629\nthat I have, if we were using the old\nWin servers, that I would be able to\n\n153\n00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:57.574\nresolve them names, but it's also\npassing through to another location.\n\n154\n00:07:57.574 --> 00:07:58.915\nMy DNS traffic.\n\n155\n00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:02.485\nSo this tells me that I have a DNS,\nat least an IP address, but\n\n156\n00:08:02.485 --> 00:08:06.755\nit doesn't really tell me that my\nrouter's able to pass that DNS traffic\n\n157\n00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:08.930\nthrough itself out to the internet.\n\n158\n00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.650\nSo, Mike,\nthat's gonna be something important.\n\n159\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.490\nThat's gonna be something that we have\nto test out when it comes to DNS.\n\n160\n00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.990\n>> .Right, So we've got some methods\nwe can use to test that out?\n\n161\n00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.870\n>> Yes, definitely.\n\n162\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:22.070\nOne of the first things that we're\ngoing to use is a technology or\n\n163\n00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.820\nutility called NS look up.\n\n164\n00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.880\nIt's one of the first things\nyou might wanna use to see\n\n165\n00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.360\nif you can resolve names out there.\n\n166\n00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.100\nAnd we can actually type that.\n\n167\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.530\nWe do an NS lookup here, and here's\nanother thing that you can do that's very,\n\n168\n00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.538\nvery handy.\n\n169\n00:08:35.538 --> 00:08:39.570\nAnd I've shown you in previous episodes\nwhere you can out to TechNet or\n\n170\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.160\nthe Office 365 support site, and\nyou can see the different URL's and\n\n171\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.650\nIP addresses that the Office\n365 platform uses.\n\n172\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.640\nWell I've actually got some\nof those IP addresses here.\n\n173\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.440\nLet me go ahead and zoom in,\nmake it a little easier to see.\n\n174\n00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.799\nYou can see some of the different URLs\nthat Office 365 is using right here,\n\n175\n00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:01.187\nso for instance outlook.office365.com.\n\n176\n00:09:01.187 --> 00:09:04.563\nWell, if I wanna make sure\ndo I have connectivity, or\n\n177\n00:09:04.563 --> 00:09:06.896\nI should say can I resolve that name?\n\n178\n00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:13.561\nThen what I can do is use NS lookup and\nwe can type outlook.office365 or\n\n179\n00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:17.646\nI'll get close to that Mike,\nmaybe not, and\n\n180\n00:09:17.646 --> 00:09:24.417\none of the things that I can see right\nhere is that I have resolved that name,\n\n181\n00:09:24.417 --> 00:09:29.791\nand you can see the IP address\nhere that it's resolving to,\n\n182\n00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:32.516\nit's 40.96.8.2.\n\n183\n00:09:32.516 --> 00:09:35.552\nSo what it's letting me know\ngoing out the gate that,\n\n184\n00:09:35.552 --> 00:09:39.200\nyes, I do have name resolution,\nbecause, what did I do here?\n\n185\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.466\nWell, I asked,\ncan you resolve this name for me?\n\n186\n00:09:42.466 --> 00:09:45.568\nNS lookup, name server lookup\nutility is a way that I can\n\n187\n00:09:45.568 --> 00:09:49.205\ntest the DNS by sending this question\nright out to the DNS server.\n\n188\n00:09:49.205 --> 00:09:53.820\nSee DNS goes through this hierarchical,\nif I can say that,\n\n189\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.418\nhierarchical Name resolution.\n\n190\n00:09:56.418 --> 00:09:57.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's a tough one.\n\n191\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.570\n>> That was a difficult one, right?\n\n192\n00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.250\nAnd it's got the top of the stack,\n\n193\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.230\nwhich is something known\nas your root hen servers.\n\n194\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.530\nAnd your root hen servers they\ndon't really resolve names.\n\n195\n00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.530\nWhat they do is they just look at\nthe question that you're asking.\n\n196\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.240\nIn this case where is\nOutlook.Office365.com.\n\n197\n00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.795\nAnd they're gonna say\nwell wait a second here,\n\n198\n00:10:12.795 --> 00:10:16.000\nI'm the top part of the hierarchy\nwho am I in control of?\n\n199\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.203\nWell all of the top level domains under\nthat, .com, .net, .tv, .org, .edu,\n\n200\n00:10:22.203 --> 00:10:26.370\n.mil, for some of our military vets out\nthere, probably familiar with that one.\n\n201\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.690\nAnd it says, okay, I see .com and\n\n202\n00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.400\nI know I'm the authority over .com,\nwhy don't you go talk to .com?\n\n203\n00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.130\nAnd then it goes through this process\nthrough the lower, the second level\n\n204\n00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.870\ndomains until it finally goes back to\nMicrosoft's network and it looks for\n\n205\n00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:46.876\na computer that in this case is probably,\nin fact, it says it right here, the alias,\n\n206\n00:10:46.876 --> 00:10:51.160\noutlook-nameast.office365.\n\n207\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.110\nIt's letting me know that this server is\nprobably somewhere on the eastern seaboard\n\n208\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.950\nas well, just based on its name.\n\n209\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.930\nIt did resolve it to an IP address.\n\n210\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.460\nOne of the first things that\nI can see is that Mike,\n\n211\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.510\nit looks like we've got\nsome name resolution here.\n\n212\n00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.390\n>> Yeah, so that's good.\n\n213\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.900\nThat tells me that I could take that\nname and type it into a browser, and\n\n214\n00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.990\nmy computer in the background is basically\ngonna do what Wes just showed us.\n\n215\n00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:15.030\nIt's gonna resolve that\nname into an IP address,\n\n216\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.920\nfeed that IP address back into my browser,\nand now I can go out and\n\n217\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.080\ndo that HTTP Get request, and\npull that log in page back.\n\n218\n00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.040\nSo that's a good start.\n\n219\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.800\n>> Yup.\n>> I know I can resolve the name.\n\n220\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.880\nWe should be good to go there.\n\n221\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.910\n>> Definitely, definitely.\n\n222\n00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:31.850\nSo you know, and one of the other services\nthat we use a lot commonly on our clients.\n\n223\n00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.770\nNow I realize that if some of you\nguys are administrators here,\n\n224\n00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.310\nmaybe you're going to say well on\nsome of the machines we don't.\n\n225\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.800\nAnd that's something known as DHCP.\n\n226\n00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.250\nRight, we talked about\nthe domain name system.\n\n227\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.610\nWell two of the most\nimportant services and\n\n228\n00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.440\nmost of the services are important\nout there in TCPI, but\n\n229\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.590\nthese definitely have to be the two\nthat you really have to worry about.\n\n230\n00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.673\nIs DHCP,\nsee when have thousands of clients,\n\n231\n00:11:53.673 --> 00:11:59.370\nyou don't wanna have to go systematically\nto each individual client workstation and\n\n232\n00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:03.264\nassign it its TCP/IP properties\nto its network adapter.\n\n233\n00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:07.793\nSo thank goodness, we've got something for\nlike lazy admins like Wes who wouldn't\n\n234\n00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:12.082\nwanna do that, unless you paid hourly\nthen I guess it wouldn't really matter.\n\n235\n00:12:12.082 --> 00:12:15.431\nThis service,\ndynamic host configuration protocol,\n\n236\n00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:19.634\nallows us to assign IP addresses,\nsubnet masks, default gateways so\n\n237\n00:12:19.634 --> 00:12:23.910\nthat we automatically get an IP address\nfor the router that we're gonna\n\n238\n00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.280\nsend information to, to make sure that\nit gets off of our local network.\n\n239\n00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.320\nAnd this is when the ipconfig command\ncome in very handy just like before.\n\n240\n00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.760\nIn fact, we can do this here.\n\n241\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:41.650\nIf we go ahead and type ipconfig space\nforward slash all, I can see that.\n\n242\n00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.090\nWe did see already that\nwe do have a datp server.\n\n243\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.460\nI can see that I have\nan active lease here.\n\n244\n00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.450\nSee if I can highlight that.\n\n245\n00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:55.200\nLease means when my client\ncommunicates with the DHCP server,\n\n246\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.180\nit says, Hey, I need an IP address.\n\n247\n00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.860\nThe DHCP server makes an offer back and\nsays, okay, I've got an IP address and\n\n248\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.820\nthese series of configuration parameters,\nwhich there are a ton of them.\n\n249\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.950\nBut we really worry about three or\nfour of them, the really main ones, right?\n\n250\n00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.500\nOur IP address, subnet mask,\nrouter, DNS servers, and\n\n251\n00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.880\nthings like your domain names, too.\n\n252\n00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.660\nSo I can see that, well, I've got one of\nthe most important here, the IP address.\n\n253\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.880\nI want you to think about the fact that if\nyou've got a cell phone in your hand, but\n\n254\n00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.450\nyou don't have a number.\n\n255\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.360\nYou don't have a number to dial.\n\n256\n00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.660\nWell nobody can get ahold of you.\n\n257\n00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.880\nYou can't call out, people can't call\nyou so you need to get a phone number\n\n258\n00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.350\nfrom some kind of provider so that you can\nconnect to their network and make calls.\n\n259\n00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.330\nWell, to make communications across\nany network you need an IP address,\n\n260\n00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.240\nwithout an IP address no\nlog in's gonna happen.\n\n261\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.510\nSo you have to make sure that\nyou have an IP address and\n\n262\n00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.770\nthat it is valid, but\nwe really don't stop there.\n\n263\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.720\nRight, just because we have an IP\naddress doesn't necessarily mean\n\n264\n00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.250\nthat we can communicate.\n\n265\n00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.380\nYou might say, well wait a second Wes,\n\n266\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.330\ndidn't you just tell me if I have\nan IP address I can communicate?\n\n267\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.580\nWell, yes.\n\n268\n00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.110\nIt doesn't mean you can communicate with\nthe right set of computers, so you have to\n\n269\n00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.420\nmake sure things like you're on the right\nnetwork, make sure that things like\n\n270\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.490\nthe subnet mask are appropriate for the IP\naddress and the network that you're on.\n\n271\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.930\nSo there are other things to consider\nwhen it comes to the IP address,\n\n272\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:17.040\nbut If you wanna test your communications,\n\n273\n00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.000\nyou wanna verify your communications,\nthen you can also use,\n\n274\n00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.070\nin combination with finding out your\nIP address, a command called ping.\n\n275\n00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.580\nPing's been around for a while.\n\n276\n00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.300\nIt's got a name, packet internet groper.\n\n277\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.130\nI love these names.\n\n278\n00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:29.714\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n279\n00:14:29.714 --> 00:14:30.691\n>> I don't know how they\n\n280\n00:14:30.691 --> 00:14:32.210\ncame up with these names, Mike,\n\n281\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.523\nbut, probably somebody sitting in\nan office drinking too much coffee,\n\n282\n00:14:35.523 --> 00:14:39.300\nstaring in front of a computer too much,\ncame up with something hilarious there.\n\n283\n00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.540\nSo we can use the ping\ncommand to send a little bit\n\n284\n00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.940\nof communication endpoints to different\ncomputers out there on our network.\n\n285\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.710\nSo if we wanna test do\nI have communication,\n\n286\n00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.010\nremember, let's jump back a little bit,\nright.\n\n287\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:53.800\nLet's step back a few.\n\n288\n00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.660\nWe're narrowing down the scope.\n\n289\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.330\nIf a user tell me that they can't\ncommunicate with Office 365 and they've\n\n290\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.940\ntried to log in, we've gotta verify\nthat it's only happening to that user.\n\n291\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.980\nIs it happening to multiple users?\n\n292\n00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.150\nHave we isolated it down\nto a specific network?\n\n293\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.860\nRight.\nYou might work for\n\n294\n00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.610\na large enterprise company that has a\nheavily internally routed infrastructure.\n\n295\n00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.430\nMaybe your subnet mask is wrong right.\n\n296\n00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.320\nMaybe you can't communicate.\n\n297\n00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.080\nSo the ping command is a very good\ncommand to use that, let's go ahead and\n\n298\n00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.084\nshow you how you can use that too.\n\n299\n00:15:24.084 --> 00:15:29.250\nNow I did an NS lookup earlier, name\nresolution right, test on Office 365 and\n\n300\n00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.600\nit's kinda interesting they're\ndoing load balancing here or\n\n301\n00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.200\nsome kind of round robin, you know, you\ncan see it came up with a different name.\n\n302\n00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.700\nIt was like 40 dot here, now it's a 132.\n\n303\n00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.430\nWell I can always, and\nI will tell you one thing.\n\n304\n00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.136\nWhen you use the ping command,\n\n305\n00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:47.465\nkeep in mind that not every company's\ngonna allow you to send an ICMP request,\n\n306\n00:15:47.465 --> 00:15:51.487\nwhich is what ping is, against their\nservers, for security purposes.\n\n307\n00:15:51.487 --> 00:15:54.214\nSo this is why I'm gonna show you\nwhen you use the ping utility,\n\n308\n00:15:54.214 --> 00:15:56.181\nping a couple different endpoints, right.\n\n309\n00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:58.700\nDon't just stop, ping one.\n\n310\n00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.121\nYou don't get replies back.\n\n311\n00:16:00.121 --> 00:16:03.650\nAnd then all of a sudden you figure,\nI don't have any communication at all.\n\n312\n00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.680\nSo one of the first things I do\nis I start by making sure that\n\n313\n00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.780\nTCPIP is recognized inside\nof my operating system.\n\n314\n00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.410\nWe commonly call this test\npinging the loop back address.\n\n315\n00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.970\nNow it's called loop back address\nbecause it isn't sending any electrical\n\n316\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.330\ncommunications out of my network adapter.\n\n317\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.010\nBut if you're familiar with the OSI model,\nit sends it down to the application layer,\n\n318\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.400\nit loops it back from the network\nlayer back up the old OSI model.\n\n319\n00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.008\nAnd we see the output,\n\n320\n00:16:32.008 --> 00:16:36.750\nand what is verifies is that\nthe operating system knows how to speak\n\n321\n00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:41.678\nthe language of transmission of\ntroll protocol Internet protocol.\n\n322\n00:16:41.678 --> 00:16:43.382\nSo, let's go ahead and\nsee if that works there.\n\n323\n00:16:43.382 --> 00:16:50.984\nSo, we're gonna ping 127.0.0.1.\n\n324\n00:16:50.984 --> 00:16:52.160\nAll right, Mike.\n\n325\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.880\nNow it does look like I am\ngetting some replies back.\n\n326\n00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.600\nWe're gonna make that a persistent ping\nhere as we talk about a little bit\n\n327\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.990\nabout what's going on here.\n\n328\n00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.940\nSee I know that sending\na protocol communication\n\n329\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.300\ninside of this operating system\nthat I'm getting responses back.\n\n330\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.220\nSo it's letting me know that\nfrom Windows' standpoint,\n\n331\n00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.050\nit understands the language of TCP/IP.\n\n332\n00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:21.050\nIt's enabled inside of the operating\nsystem and it can communicate.\n\n333\n00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:26.930\nSo when we say using the ping utility, we\ntalk about using it starting locally and\n\n334\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.500\nthen working your way out to\nthe edge of your network.\n\n335\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.510\nSo the next thing that I wanna do is I\nwanna verify does my network adapter and\n\n336\n00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:39.340\nmy operating system, cuz they\nhardware software they work together,\n\n337\n00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.110\ncan it respond to itself\nwhen it's called on?\n\n338\n00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.420\nOr can it respond when it's called upon?\n\n339\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.350\nSo it's essentially what an IP address is.\n\n340\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.110\nIt identifies you as an end point.\n\n341\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.420\nSo I need to verify can it communicate.\n\n342\n00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.700\nSo one of the next things I will do is\nI'll wanna ping my own local IP address.\n\n343\n00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.295\nThey call it pinging the local host.\n\n344\n00:17:57.295 --> 00:18:01.225\nAnd you can use the all parameter\nat the end of IP config.\n\n345\n00:18:01.225 --> 00:18:05.125\nBut if you're just trying to look for\na very quick IP address on a computer,\n\n346\n00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:06.685\nyou don't have to do the all, and\n\n347\n00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:09.097\nit will get you to the information\nyou need right away.\n\n348\n00:18:09.097 --> 00:18:10.847\nNow, kinda interesting.\n\n349\n00:18:10.847 --> 00:18:15.797\nIt's not really a show about Windows 10,\nbut one of the things that's new\n\n350\n00:18:15.797 --> 00:18:18.937\nin the command prompt today is\nthe fact that you can copy and paste.\n\n351\n00:18:18.937 --> 00:18:21.907\nAnd that's something that\nyou couldn't do before.\n\n352\n00:18:21.907 --> 00:18:25.567\nYou go to do your Control-V and you'd\nget a couple little v's in there today.\n\n353\n00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:27.810\nWell, we don't have to\nworry about that any more.\n\n354\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.480\nThey've actually added this\nfunctionality to command.\n\n355\n00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.860\nSo I can do my control v,\nand you can see, boom,\n\n356\n00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.030\nit puts the IP address right in there.\n\n357\n00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:39.030\nI can do a ping, and\nnow what do we got going on?\n\n358\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.070\nNow notice that I've sent four packets.\n\n359\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.418\nReceived four packets.\n\n360\n00:18:43.418 --> 00:18:45.060\n0% lost, right?\n\n361\n00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.420\nSo what ping's telling me is that\nwhen I ping the local IP address\n\n362\n00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.320\nmy network adapter goes oh,\nyou're calling on me?\n\n363\n00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.940\nWell here I am, I can talk back to you.\n\n364\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.060\nSo that's always a good thing.\n\n365\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.010\nNow one of the other things that I\nmight want to do is verify that I have\n\n366\n00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.860\ncommunication with other\ncomputers inside of my network.\n\n367\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.080\nSee you might say well wait a second,\nwe're just troubleshooting sign in issues.\n\n368\n00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:11.040\nWell, if you can't communicate from your\ncomputer, to another computer inside of\n\n369\n00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.390\nyour network, then you're definitely not\ngonna be able to communicate to your\n\n370\n00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.895\nrouter, out there too, wherever\nthe computer is that's hosting, or\n\n371\n00:19:17.895 --> 00:19:20.745\nmultiple computers, data centers,\nthat are hosting things like Office 365.\n\n372\n00:19:20.745 --> 00:19:24.225\nSo that'll be the next thing we'll do.\n\n373\n00:19:24.225 --> 00:19:26.815\nSo now what I need to do is,\nI need to find another IP\n\n374\n00:19:26.815 --> 00:19:29.355\naddress to another device\nthat might have communicated.\n\n375\n00:19:29.355 --> 00:19:33.415\nSo I'm gonna kinda cheat here and\nI'm gonna use my good old arc command.\n\n376\n00:19:33.415 --> 00:19:35.985\nAnd that shows me that there's\nan IP address in this table.\n\n377\n00:19:35.985 --> 00:19:41.220\nIt's another computer on this local\nnetwork and I'm gonna go ahead,\n\n378\n00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.370\nand what will we do?\n\n379\n00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:44.830\nWell, we'll go ahead and just ping that.\n\n380\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.960\nThank goodness for that copy and\npaste functionality that they've added.\n\n381\n00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.220\nOh, and it looks like maybe\nthat might not be computing.\n\n382\n00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.430\nOkay, so well, this is a good thing to\nshow you guys, troubleshooting here.\n\n383\n00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.040\nLet's say that I am\nusing this ping utility.\n\n384\n00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.760\nAnd I'm pinging a device in my network.\n\n385\n00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.010\nAnd you can see right now that this\ncomputer hasn't been turned off,\n\n386\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.160\nso the IP address that\nI'm pinging right here,\n\n387\n00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.965\nthat computer actually might\nbe turned off right now.\n\n388\n00:20:07.965 --> 00:20:09.090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n389\n00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.060\n>> And this lets you know, and\nit's good to see this information.\n\n390\n00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.430\nRequest timed out means\nI can't communicate.\n\n391\n00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.370\nNow I have to figure out, is that\na communication problem on this end,\n\n392\n00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.440\nor is it a communication problem on that,\n\n393\n00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.940\nthe end of the computer that\nyou're trying to communicate with.\n\n394\n00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.590\nSo maybe I want to go a little\nbit further than that, right?\n\n395\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.740\nIf you can't communicate with\nanother computer on your network,\n\n396\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:35.050\ntry another computer on your network\nuntil you can find one that replies back.\n\n397\n00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.340\n>> I'll tell you then,\nI always like to use my default gateway.\n\n398\n00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.560\nBecause it's gonna be, right,\n\n399\n00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.210\nyour default gateway has to be\non the same network as you.\n\n400\n00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.900\nAnd it should always be up and running so\nthat people can get out of the network and\n\n401\n00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.620\ncommunicate with other\nsub-nets and/or the Internet.\n\n402\n00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.310\nSo that's usually one I like to try.\n\n403\n00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.530\nCuz if you try your buddy's computer in\nthe cubicle next door as Wes showed you,\n\n404\n00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.370\nif they happen to turn their computer\noff while they went to lunch,\n\n405\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.100\nyou might be banging your head against\nthe desk going, why can't I talk to it?\n\n406\n00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.760\nBut really he just disconnected or\nhe shut it down.\n\n407\n00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.800\n>> Mike that's a great idea.\n\n408\n00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.680\nLet's go ahead and let's ping the default\ngateway to see if we can at least reach\n\n409\n00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.280\nthe edge of our network and communicate\nwith the device that's gonna take that\n\n410\n00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.130\ninformation and take it off of our local\nnetwork and put it out there in the cloud\n\n411\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.920\nor the Internet, and\nroute it across those networks.\n\n412\n00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.870\nNow I can see right here that I'm getting\nreplies back, this is the default gateway,\n\n413\n00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.350\nyou guys have seen now how to use\nipconfig space forward slash all,\n\n414\n00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.370\nI kind of memorized it as we were there.\n\n415\n00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.610\nRemember, if you wanna\nfind your default gateway,\n\n416\n00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:37.490\nit's in the information with the DHCP\nserver, your DNS server there, too.\n\n417\n00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.020\nAll right, and\nI can see that I've got communication.\n\n418\n00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.520\nWe've verified that we can communicate,\nat least on our local network.\n\n419\n00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.440\nNow, this is just to\nthe edge of our network.\n\n420\n00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.500\nNow we've gotta go a little\nbit farther than that.\n\n421\n00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.370\nWe've gotta find out can I send traffic,\n\n422\n00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:58.440\nagain remember this all centers around\nnot being able to log into Office 365,\n\n423\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.460\nnow I gotta see if I can\ncommunicate with the Internet.\n\n424\n00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.430\nAnd Mike it's interesting.\n\n425\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.650\nYou told me quite a few quite a few\nyears ago now when we were working with\n\n426\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:07.640\na different company.\n\n427\n00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.630\nThere's a handful of addresses\nout there guys that typically\n\n428\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.060\nwill return replies back if you need to\nuse them and I'm going to go ahead and use\n\n429\n00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:18.760\none of those ones that an old mentor of\nmine showed me and it's never failed me.\n\n430\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.400\nAnd we're going to go ahead and ping and\n\n431\n00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.650\nI'm going to ping just\na public IP address here.\n\n432\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.000\nAnd maybe, if I can.\n\n433\n00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.295\nCan you phrase that in the form\nof an IP address, Wes?\n\n434\n00:22:28.295 --> 00:22:30.815\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll just ping here and\n\n435\n00:22:30.815 --> 00:22:33.630\nnotice that I'm getting communications.\n\n436\n00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:39.560\nSo not being able to log in to Office 365,\nat least from the standpoint of this\n\n437\n00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:44.430\ncomputer, doesn't seem to have anything to\ndo with the network communications, right?\n\n438\n00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.680\nSo let's kind of step back.\n\n439\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.600\nMike, we've verified DHCP servers and\ngot an IP address, I verified that I do\n\n440\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.155\nhave some kind of DNS name resolution,\nwe resolved that name to office.\n\n441\n00:22:55.155 --> 00:22:59.270\nOutlook.office365.com.\n\n442\n00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.550\nWe've verified that we have a gateway, and\n\n443\n00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:05.550\nnow I can at least communicate with\nit the router, and pass the router.\n\n444\n00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.395\nSo, looks like Mike so far,\n\n445\n00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:10.745\nwe at least have network communication\nfrom the standpoint of this computer.\n\n446\n00:23:10.745 --> 00:23:12.015\n>> Yeah, I like your logic there.\n\n447\n00:23:12.015 --> 00:23:16.025\nI'm a big fan of starting local and\nworking my way out, and there are other\n\n448\n00:23:16.025 --> 00:23:19.955\npeople that like to divide things in\nhalf and kind of drill down that way.\n\n449\n00:23:19.955 --> 00:23:24.275\nBut starting with that loop back address,\ntesting that internal TCP IP stack,\n\n450\n00:23:24.275 --> 00:23:28.475\nreally inside your machine, and\nthen moving into your IP address itself.\n\n451\n00:23:28.475 --> 00:23:30.510\nSo now you're on the the edge\nof your computer.\n\n452\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.070\nDoes your computer know\nwhat it's address is?\n\n453\n00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.720\nAnd will it respond if anybody tries\nto communicate with that address?\n\n454\n00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.969\nAnd then moving a little bit further\nout onto your local area network,\n\n455\n00:23:39.969 --> 00:23:41.908\ncan I ping that default gateway, right?\n\n456\n00:23:41.908 --> 00:23:46.752\nAnd then taking that next step out beyond\nyour default gateway, out to the WAN or\n\n457\n00:23:46.752 --> 00:23:50.872\nout to the world wide web or\nthe Internet and seeing if I can ping, and\n\n458\n00:23:50.872 --> 00:23:52.270\nget responses there.\n\n459\n00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.616\nSo as Wes said, you know,\n\n460\n00:23:53.616 --> 00:23:56.881\nI've checked that electrical\nconnectivity from my machine.\n\n461\n00:23:56.881 --> 00:23:58.486\nAll the way out to the Internet.\n\n462\n00:23:58.486 --> 00:24:02.689\nI know that's good, and then with the name\nresolution test that he showed us,\n\n463\n00:24:02.689 --> 00:24:05.120\nI know I can resolve\nnames into IP addresses.\n\n464\n00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.270\nSo if I can resolve the name\ninto an IP address and\n\n465\n00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.880\nI can send the packet out there\nto the Internet and back,\n\n466\n00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.690\nthen there's definitely no\nconnectivity issues on my end.\n\n467\n00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.550\nIt doesn't tell me if\ntheir servers are up,\n\n468\n00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.010\nif they're having issues on their end,\nor any other log on issues, but\n\n469\n00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:24.290\nas far as electrical connectivity,\nwe've verified that we have that.\n\n470\n00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.740\n>> That's right, you know.\n\n471\n00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.885\nAnd keeping that line of thought there,\nMike, I'm gonna change it up a little bit,\n\n472\n00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:31.470\ncuz we're gonna get into the password\naspect here in a second.\n\n473\n00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:34.920\nBut since we're talking about connections,\nwe might as well just stay in that area,\n\n474\n00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.770\ncuz Mike mentioned\nelectrical communications,\n\n475\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.410\nelectrical connections, right?\n\n476\n00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.300\nAnd you always wanna think\nof simple fixes first.\n\n477\n00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.990\nWe got another host here that you\nmight have seen before, Ronnie Wong.\n\n478\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.982\nI don't know how many times I've gone to\ntroubleshoot something and I ask Ronnie,\n\n479\n00:24:47.982 --> 00:24:49.320\nI said Ronnie, can you help me here?\n\n480\n00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.038\nAnd Ronnie says, Wes,\ndid you check the cable?\n\n481\n00:24:51.038 --> 00:24:54.289\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I can tell you, I wish I couldn't.\n\n482\n00:24:54.289 --> 00:24:56.541\nI wish the answer wasn't the case.\n\n483\n00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:58.640\nI don't know how many times\nhe's actually been right.\n\n484\n00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.250\nYou'll walk over and plug the cable in and\nyou've got communication, right?\n\n485\n00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.560\nSome of you guys have probably\nsat at a desk before, and\n\n486\n00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.270\nthe cables are in the back\nof the desk there.\n\n487\n00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.310\nAnd you stretch out, and you accidentally\nhit one of the cables, and guess what?\n\n488\n00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:15.590\nYou've popped the ethernet cable out\nof the back of the network adapter.\n\n489\n00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.860\nSo we wanna kinda talk\na little bit about that.\n\n490\n00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.650\nSince we're talking about the services,\n\n491\n00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.920\nwe might as well talk about things that\ndirectly affect a network adapter itself.\n\n492\n00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.310\nAnd its communications,\nwhether the services are available or not.\n\n493\n00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:32.470\nAnd that's where we start with something\nvery simple, physical connection.\n\n494\n00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.060\nAll right?\n\n495\n00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.800\nIf I look on the back of the computer,\nif I look at the device.\n\n496\n00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.660\nIf it happens to be a laptop,\nmaybe you're not gonna have a connection.\n\n497\n00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.480\nMaybe it's gonna be a wireless connection.\n\n498\n00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:47.280\nSo again, whether it's physical bounded\nmedia, or bounded media, excuse me.\n\n499\n00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.920\nOr whether it's a radiated connection,\na lot of the troubleshooting methods\n\n500\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.120\nare gonna be the same, it just depends on\nwhat type of media you're gonna be using.\n\n501\n00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.670\nSo, if it happens to be a wired\nconnection, check the back of\n\n502\n00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:03.660\nthe computer, check the network adapter\nand look for link lights, right?\n\n503\n00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.280\nVery simply, you've got a series of link\nlights, and if there's activity on them,\n\n504\n00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.520\nthen chances are,\nyou've got a communication.\n\n505\n00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.710\nIf you look back there I know, in fact\nI've got one computer that I've had\n\n506\n00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:18.220\na problem with the driver as it's gone\nthrough different Windows versions,\n\n507\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.100\nand I honestly, I can't say that\nit's the driver within Windows.\n\n508\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.878\nI think the network adapter might be\nfailing, and I'll go back there and I'll\n\n509\n00:26:23.878 --> 00:26:28.470\nplug it in, it's got a solid light, and\nI can tell that there's a problem with it.\n\n510\n00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.530\nIt's not communicating.\n\n511\n00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.352\nSo that could be a telltale sign\nthat there's some kind of problem,\n\n512\n00:26:33.352 --> 00:26:35.220\nsomething's problematic.\n\n513\n00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.336\nNow, just as simple as that,\nis your network adapter enabled?\n\n514\n00:26:40.336 --> 00:26:43.076\nLet me show you that inside\nof the operating system here.\n\n515\n00:26:43.076 --> 00:26:48.863\nNow my head's kinda covering it up here,\nbut if you were to get into the little\n\n516\n00:26:48.863 --> 00:26:53.939\nmonitor icon in the lower right-hand\ncorner of your taskbar here,\n\n517\n00:26:53.939 --> 00:26:58.052\nwill allow you to open the Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n518\n00:26:58.052 --> 00:27:01.458\nAnd this is kind of your one-stop shop\nwhen you're troubleshooting things\n\n519\n00:27:01.458 --> 00:27:04.544\nlike your network connections inside\nof your operating system, and\n\n520\n00:27:04.544 --> 00:27:06.165\nit's a good place to know.\n\n521\n00:27:06.165 --> 00:27:10.780\nAnd if I look right away, I can see that\nI am connected to a private network.\n\n522\n00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.200\nAll right, and\nI can see the connections here, Ethernet0.\n\n523\n00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.302\nNow, I can click this task link, they've\ngot these little task links all over\n\n524\n00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:19.289\nthe place, and I have to say,\nI really like them.\n\n525\n00:27:19.289 --> 00:27:20.620\nAt first, I was like,\n\n526\n00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:25.117\nyou give me a link that leads me to a door\nthat leads me to another closed door.\n\n527\n00:27:25.117 --> 00:27:29.369\nAnd in Office 365, I have to tell you,\nsome of those jump links as much\n\n528\n00:27:29.369 --> 00:27:32.942\nI'm putting my foot in my mouth here,\nI actually like them.\n\n529\n00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:35.859\nThey take you to some of\nthe common locations, so\n\n530\n00:27:35.859 --> 00:27:40.845\nI could go to connections here or\nI could go to change adapter settings.\n\n531\n00:27:40.845 --> 00:27:41.645\nAnd let me show you that.\n\n532\n00:27:41.645 --> 00:27:43.685\nSo Ethernet0 you'll see here.\n\n533\n00:27:43.685 --> 00:27:47.445\nIf I decide to choose Ethernet0,\nit just takes me to the properties.\n\n534\n00:27:47.445 --> 00:27:52.095\nNow I wanna go ahead and kinda show\nyou the change adapter settings, and\n\n535\n00:27:52.095 --> 00:27:56.308\nnotice that Ethernet0 here as well,\nand I could choose the status.\n\n536\n00:27:56.308 --> 00:27:59.740\nNow, it's as simple as enabling and\ndisabling the network adapter here, so\n\n537\n00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.060\nlet me go ahead and just disable it and\nsee what would you find if you\n\n538\n00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.730\ndetermined that, hey,\nwe don't have network communications.\n\n539\n00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:09.740\nI've tried the services,\nI've tried ping, nothing seems to work.\n\n540\n00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.140\nCould be quite as simple as just\nright-clicking on that network icon for\n\n541\n00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.320\nyour local area connection and\nchoosing enable, right?\n\n542\n00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.310\nIf I've got [LAUGH] the power turned off,\nor at least the communication on\n\n543\n00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.170\nthe network adapter, it doesn't matter\nwhat your operating system knows.\n\n544\n00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.542\nThe one thing that it knows is\nyour network adapter's sleeping.\n\n545\n00:28:25.542 --> 00:28:29.460\n>> Absolutely, and this one's bitten me\na couple of times, especially on wireless,\n\n546\n00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.460\non the radios, cuz a lot of these laptops\nnowadays, we'll want them to go to sleep.\n\n547\n00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.706\nWe want them to reduce the power\nconsumption to save that battery life, so\n\n548\n00:28:37.706 --> 00:28:41.062\nit will have some kind of key or\ncombination function key,\n\n549\n00:28:41.062 --> 00:28:45.648\nor like on my Alienware, it's actually\na softkey that can turn that radio on and\n\n550\n00:28:45.648 --> 00:28:46.964\noff for the wireless.\n\n551\n00:28:46.964 --> 00:28:49.301\nAnd the problem is,\nI'll hit it accidentally and\n\n552\n00:28:49.301 --> 00:28:51.637\nnot realize that I've\nturned that radio off, and\n\n553\n00:28:51.637 --> 00:28:54.487\nyou'll wonder why all of\na sudden I've lost connectivity.\n\n554\n00:28:54.487 --> 00:28:56.652\nYou start doing some troubleshooting,\n\n555\n00:28:56.652 --> 00:29:00.036\noh, I accidentally turned\nthe wireless network adapter off.\n\n556\n00:29:00.036 --> 00:29:04.920\nI remember an old ThinkPad that\nactually had a switch on the bottom.\n\n557\n00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.310\nSo you had to flip the laptop over and\nthere was a little tiny switch down there,\n\n558\n00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:10.410\nand I remember this person\nbrought me that laptop.\n\n559\n00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.160\nAnd I'm troubleshooting and I'm going,\nwhy can I not get this to work?\n\n560\n00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.400\nCome to find out there's a physical\nswitch to power up that wireless adapter.\n\n561\n00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.276\n>> Yeah, yeah, definitely, as many times\nas I've fat-fingered the keyboard,\n\n562\n00:29:20.276 --> 00:29:21.811\nI've done it a couple of times too myself.\n\n563\n00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:24.275\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was only trying to adjust\n\n564\n00:29:24.275 --> 00:29:26.940\nthe brightness, but\nnow apparently, I'm not so\n\n565\n00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.868\nbright because I can't\ncommunicate to the Internet.\n\n566\n00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:33.110\n[LAUGH] All right, so good, good advice.\n\n567\n00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:36.750\nThe other thing that you might wanna do,\nwe talked about enabling or\n\n568\n00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.555\ndisabling the network adapter.\n\n569\n00:29:38.555 --> 00:29:40.320\nWe've talked about\nthe physical connection, and\n\n570\n00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.080\nkeep in mind that the physical\nconnection can be a physical wire,\n\n571\n00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.790\nor just like Mike said, radiated energy.\n\n572\n00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.540\nIt doesn't matter,\n\n573\n00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.790\nthe difference in that one is,\nwhat are you using to send the signal?\n\n574\n00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.730\nWhen it comes down to it,\n\n575\n00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.710\nthe properties in your network\nadapter are gonna really be the same.\n\n576\n00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.320\nSo, the next thing that we, hey, and\nwe've talked about link lights too.\n\n577\n00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.630\nLet me also show where\nyou can manually set\n\n578\n00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.140\nthe TCP/IP properties of your network\nadapter cuz it's gonna be important.\n\n579\n00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.775\nAll right, if I'm here in,\nsame location by the way guys,\n\n580\n00:30:06.775 --> 00:30:09.641\nwe're in the network connection,\nwe haven't gone anywhere.\n\n581\n00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:14.058\nAnd I can choose status,\nwe've seen the ipconfig, right,\n\n582\n00:30:14.058 --> 00:30:17.187\nand it's showed us our information here.\n\n583\n00:30:17.187 --> 00:30:21.794\nAnd I could choose details, and I can get\nthe same GUI based information inside of\n\n584\n00:30:21.794 --> 00:30:25.407\nthe status dialogue box that\nyou've seen inside of ipconfig.\n\n585\n00:30:25.407 --> 00:30:29.424\nBut what I really want is this little\nproperties icon right here, right?\n\n586\n00:30:29.424 --> 00:30:31.851\nSee this little properties button,\nand keep in mind,\n\n587\n00:30:31.851 --> 00:30:33.290\nstandard users can't do this.\n\n588\n00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.300\nNotice a little shield there,\n\n589\n00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.020\nthat's directly related to something\nknown as the user account control,\n\n590\n00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.070\nwhich means standard users\nwill not be able to do this.\n\n591\n00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:43.424\nSo if you're on a help desk ticket, you\ngot a standard user sitting at the desk,\n\n592\n00:30:43.424 --> 00:30:46.999\nthey can look at stuff all they want, but\nthey're not gonna be able to configure it.\n\n593\n00:30:46.999 --> 00:30:50.226\nSo you might need to use a remote\ndesktop or sneaker note at that point.\n\n594\n00:30:50.226 --> 00:30:55.460\nSo I'll choose properties here and\na few of the different\n\n595\n00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:00.049\nnetwork protocols that\nare bound to the adaptor.\n\n596\n00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:03.841\nBut the one I really want is just\nInternet Protocol Version 4, TCP IPV4 and\n\n597\n00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:05.389\nI can choose properties here.\n\n598\n00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:09.736\nAnd I can see that this is set up for\nDHCP, which is in this case,\n\n599\n00:31:09.736 --> 00:31:12.541\nfrom a client standpoint is what I want.\n\n600\n00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:17.097\nLike I said, you might have a few handful\nof work stations that maybe are gonna be\n\n601\n00:31:17.097 --> 00:31:18.462\nmanually configured.\n\n602\n00:31:18.462 --> 00:31:21.506\nA lot of times, we save that for\nthings like our servers and\n\n603\n00:31:21.506 --> 00:31:24.242\ndevices that are providing services and\nprinters,\n\n604\n00:31:24.242 --> 00:31:28.423\nbut at least I can check this information,\nI can verify that it is set up to DHCP.\n\n605\n00:31:28.423 --> 00:31:29.978\nSo when it comes down to it, Mike.\n\n606\n00:31:29.978 --> 00:31:30.489\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n607\n00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:33.856\n>> As long as know of a few different\nlocations, again, remember,\n\n608\n00:31:33.856 --> 00:31:37.176\ncheck your services, DHCP and\nDNS are gonna be very important.\n\n609\n00:31:37.176 --> 00:31:39.514\nRouting information off\nof your local network,\n\n610\n00:31:39.514 --> 00:31:41.940\nthat default gateway is important as well.\n\n611\n00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.300\nAnd then it comes down to things\nlike physical connections and\n\n612\n00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.070\nthen the properties of the IP address or\nthe network adapter themselves.\n\n613\n00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.430\nIf you check a handful of these things\nnow, then we can go into more, and\n\n614\n00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.278\nnot necessarily advanced things, but\n\n615\n00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:57.256\nthen we can start to troubleshoot things\nlike software from a software standpoint.\n\n616\n00:31:57.256 --> 00:31:59.717\nBut looks like we're gonna have\nto do that in another episode.\n\n617\n00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:03.045\n>> We are, Wes, I was gonna have to cut\nyou off there, cuz I know you got a little\n\n618\n00:32:03.045 --> 00:32:05.905\nmore information to help us\ntroubleshooting our connectivity or\n\n619\n00:32:05.905 --> 00:32:08.141\nsupporting our cloud users,\nbut unfortunately,\n\n620\n00:32:08.141 --> 00:32:09.655\nwe are out of time on this episode.\n\n621\n00:32:09.655 --> 00:32:12.755\nGood look at some of those\nbasic TCPIP troubleshooting,\n\n622\n00:32:12.755 --> 00:32:15.090\nwhich is really where we've gotta start.\n\n623\n00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:19.380\nCloud based or not, we've gotta be able\nto connect to our local area network so\n\n624\n00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.710\nwe can get out to the rest of our network\nand then hopefully out to the cloud.\n\n625\n00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:23.620\nSo great information there.\n\n626\n00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.790\nThank you for that, Wes,\ngreat demonstrations.\n\n627\n00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.840\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n628\n00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.320\nSigning off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n629\n00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:29.896\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n630\n00:32:29.896 --> 00:32:30.825\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n631\n00:32:30.825

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.980\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.150\nToday we're doing our\nMTA cloud fundamentals.\n\n5\n00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.090\nAnd in this episode we're\nactually doing a continuation of\n\n6\n00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.230\nour supporting cloud users.\n\n7\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.750\nSo far we've taken a look at\ndoing some basic troubleshooting.\n\n8\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.640\nIf I've got a user or users that\nare having trouble connecting out there to\n\n9\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.370\nthese cloud services, where do we start?\n\n10\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.800\nA lot of it really is basic trouble\nshooting that we've learned\n\n11\n00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.500\nin say courses like network plus.\n\n12\n00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.210\nLooking at our TCPIP settings,\nusing IP config, Ping,\n\n13\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.590\nNS look up, those kind of things to\nverify our network connectivity.\n\n14\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.190\nWhether it's a local resource, or\nwhether it's a cloud based resource.\n\n15\n00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.120\nAnd there's still a few more things\nthat we need to go through to make\n\n16\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.590\nsure that I can get out there to the\ninternet and get to those cloud services.\n\n17\n00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.140\nAnd here to help us with\nthat as always is Wes Bryan.\n\n18\n00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.950\nHow's it going, Wes?\n\n19\n00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.600\n>> Going great, man.\n\n20\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.500\nIt's great to be back here\nagain as always with IT ProTV.\n\n21\n00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.590\nAnd that's right, a few of the extra\nthings that you know we just\n\n22\n00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.660\nquite didn't get to fit\nin the last episode, and\n\n23\n00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.910\none of the first ones we have\nto think about is the firewalls.\n\n24\n00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.900\nFirewall issues.\n\n25\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.890\nCould the firewalls be\ncausing the problem?\n\n26\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.050\nWell, we need to find find\nout if that's the case.\n\n27\n00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.130\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.420\ntouch base on the one that you'll have to\nhave administrative, well I guess you'll\n\n29\n00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.620\nhave to have administrative\naccess to get to either one.\n\n30\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.700\nBut you might not have easy access\nto a network based firewall.\n\n31\n00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.720\nSo that's gonna be the one that\nstands out on your network there.\n\n32\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.635\nAnd it's screening all the traffic\nthat's coming into your network.\n\n33\n00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:45.990\nAnd going to any user\ninside of the network.\n\n34\n00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.190\nAnd then likewise, outbound\ncommunications are being scrutinized,\n\n35\n00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.780\ncould be allowed, or could be blocked.\n\n36\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.470\nThat one right there again,\n\n37\n00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.670\nis not going to be something that's so\neasy for you to tell.\n\n38\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.100\nHowever, there are some some steps\nyou can take Inside of the operating\n\n39\n00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.150\nsystem to ensure that it's not\na firewall that's causing your issue.\n\n40\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.120\nSo we just kinda wanna look around at what\nis known as a software based firewall.\n\n41\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.300\nThe software based firewall is\nalso called a host based firewall.\n\n42\n00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.650\nThat is screening the traffic that's\ncoming to and from the workstation.\n\n43\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.080\nSo if you get an end user that calls up\nand says, well hey, I can't communicate\n\n44\n00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.910\noutbound, or I'm not receiving emails,\nwell we might have to find out\n\n45\n00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.080\nif there's a firewall configuration\nthat might be causing the problem.\n\n46\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.980\nWhether it's a small business or\nwhether it's an enterprise business,\n\n47\n00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.050\na lot of times you're gonna control this\nthrough something like group policy, and\n\n48\n00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.760\nyour administrators are gonna set out\ngroup policy objects that will configure\n\n49\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.370\nthose settings.\n\n50\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.045\nBut we want to make sure those\nsettings are configured.\n\n51\n00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:44.680\nCuz I can tell you what, Mike.\n\n52\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.245\n>> The admins never make mistakes.\n\n53\n00:02:46.245 --> 00:02:47.080\n[LAUGH] no never.\n\n54\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.320\n>> And we never configure\nthings without our glasses.\n\n55\n00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.271\nYou know, that's not a bad thing, right?\n\n56\n00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:55.887\n[LAUGH] make standard end users\nenterprise administrators.\n\n57\n00:02:55.887 --> 00:02:58.070\nWe've never seen that happen before.\n\n58\n00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.020\n>> Guilty as charged.\n\n59\n00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.120\n>> [LAUGH] so you guys,\nlet's let you in on the joke here.\n\n60\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.660\nMike and I worked for\n\n61\n00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.150\na company before and I needed some\nfunctionality I needed to perform, and\n\n62\n00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.160\nit really wasn't something that needed\na lot of administrative functionality.\n\n63\n00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.530\nMike accidentally made\nme the enterprise admin.\n\n64\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.329\nNow I'm in charge of the whole domain and\nI locked him out, right?\n\n65\n00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> The principle of lease privilege?\n\n66\n00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.850\nWhat the heck.\n>> [LAUGH] yeah, there you go.\n\n67\n00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.050\nSo, this is one of the reasons that you\nmight wanna be checking your firewalls.\n\n68\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.820\nHopefully your admins can\nconfigure this for you.\n\n69\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.620\nLet's go ahead and show you that.\n\n70\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.600\nA couple of different ways\nthat you can do this.\n\n71\n00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.990\nThis is inside of Windows 10 here that\nwe're looking at, latest and greatest.\n\n72\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.760\nAnd we can go the traditional way.\n\n73\n00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.870\nOne of the things to keep in\nmind is that with Windows 8.1,\n\n74\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.120\nWindows 8, Windows 7, the way I'm\nshowing you at first is gonna be one of\n\n75\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.710\nthe easiest ways to get there and it works\nacross all of those operating systems.\n\n76\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.410\nAnd then I'll come back and\n\n77\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.940\nshow you one that's a little more\nspecific to Windows 10 and its interface.\n\n78\n00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.090\nSo starting with Windows 8,\n8.1 actually it was Windows 8.\n\n79\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.260\nThey started with the administrative\nlittle quicklings menu here just by right\n\n80\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.050\nclicking on your little windows tile.\n\n81\n00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.100\nAnd I can tell you it's\na very handy thing to have.\n\n82\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.570\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna go to control panel here.\n\n83\n00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.320\nWe bring up the Control Panel.\n\n84\n00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.390\nThis really hasn't changed too much.\n\n85\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.860\nA couple of naming conventions\nhave changed just slightly,\n\n86\n00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.190\na traditional control panel.\n\n87\n00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.720\nSo again, Windows 7, Windows 8, 8.1,\nand you can see here in Windows 10.\n\n88\n00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.740\nSo good universal way to get there.\n\n89\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.390\nNow we're gonna be under System and\nSecurity.\n\n90\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.380\nAnd then we have the Windows\nfirewall right here.\n\n91\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.880\nNow when we look at the basic firewall,\n\n92\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.540\nwe gotta figure out is the firewall\nturned on or is it turned off?\n\n93\n00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.490\nAnd whether we need to\nallow applications through.\n\n94\n00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.050\nOne of the great things about this is\nwhen it comes to the Windows firewall,\n\n95\n00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.130\nyou're gonna see that there are a lot\nof what they call exceptions.\n\n96\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.850\nNow these exceptions are built in and\n\n97\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.560\nit does require administrative\naccess to get to this.\n\n98\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.330\nBut I can come in here if I want, and I\ncan look at some of the various settings.\n\n99\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.990\nI can see Email and Accounts, we've got\n\n100\n00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.380\nApplications are allowed to communicate,\nand we'll look at the different profiles.\n\n101\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.790\nNow the profiles are important.\n\n102\n00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.470\nThese are directly related to\nsomething called network locations.\n\n103\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.633\nAnd Windows support something known as\nNLA, sorry to throw an acronym at you, but\n\n104\n00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:21.640\nthat's network location awareness.\n\n105\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.770\nAnd what this means is, depending\non what network location I choose,\n\n106\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.620\nit's gonna set the firewall\nprofile accordingly.\n\n107\n00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.090\nAnd if some people don't really check,\nthey just click a button, they might\n\n108\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.670\nset their firewall profile to the public\nprofile and its the most restrictive.\n\n109\n00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.490\nIt doesn't allow things like file sharing,\n\n110\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.590\nit doesn't allow network\ndiscovery to be turned on.\n\n111\n00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.870\nSo it could be a little\nbit more restrictive.\n\n112\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.622\nNow if you're in a wi fi hotspot,\nand you happen to be doing work,\n\n113\n00:05:52.622 --> 00:05:54.960\nwhich is probably not a good thing to do.\n\n114\n00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.230\nBut if you do, you might be on\nthe public profile setting.\n\n115\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.840\nBut I just kinda wanna show you\nhere that if you needed to you\n\n116\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.410\ncould open up the firewall by enabling\nsome of these different rules.\n\n117\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.990\nLooks like we seem to be good here.\n\n118\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.740\nLooks like the edge,\nif you happen to use the edge browser,\n\n119\n00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.990\ndoesn't seem like it's\nbeing blocked at all.\n\n120\n00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.240\nI believe Internet Explorer's\nin this list too.\n\n121\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.900\nIt doesn't look to be in here.\n\n122\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.580\nNo, it's not in here.\n\n123\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.420\nI can see OneNote can communicate, so\nyou can see that we don't seem to have any\n\n124\n00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.310\nfirewall rules that are blocking\nit in the basic editor.\n\n125\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.430\nNow, keep in mind that this is the host\nbased firewall system that's running\n\n126\n00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.550\non Windows.\n\n127\n00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.590\nIt's a built in Windows firewall.\n\n128\n00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.680\nIt won't be as easy to check if you\nhave a network based firewall because\n\n129\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.710\nthat's a separate device.\n\n130\n00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.610\nThat's what we call\na hardware based firewall,\n\n131\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.550\nand that's going to be\nsomething completely separate.\n\n132\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.610\nIt'd be another device, security device,\n\n133\n00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.250\nthat's screening all of the information\ncoming in and outbound of your network.\n\n134\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.770\n>> Yeah, very good.\n\n135\n00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.160\nSo we've gotta deal with both maybe.\n\n136\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.080\nYou might have a network based\nfirewall that you've gotta adjust\n\n137\n00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.245\nas well as that host base.\n\n138\n00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:05.000\nCuz you adjust one and not the other, your\ntraffic's still gonna get blocked, right?\n\n139\n00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.530\n>> That's right.\n\n140\n00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.040\nThat's right.\n\n141\n00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.520\nAnd this could go a little bit farther.\n\n142\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.760\nNow, I wouldn't worry too much\nabout things like IPsec, you know,\n\n143\n00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.180\nbeing on this exam.\n\n144\n00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.160\nYou know, worrying about\ntroubleshooting IPsec communications.\n\n145\n00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.950\nBut, If your computer, if you're in\na heavily managed environment, and\n\n146\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.330\nit's requiring things like authentication\nand secure encryption with your\n\n147\n00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330\ncommunications, that very well\ncould cause a problem too.\n\n148\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.020\nAnd if you need to see that information,\nyou have to go to a different firewall.\n\n149\n00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.680\nNow, you might say, well, wait, Wes,\nthere's two different firewalls?\n\n150\n00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.190\nWell, yes and no.\n\n151\n00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.570\nIt's kinda tricky on how they word it.\n\n152\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.670\nIt's really the same firewall, but\nit's just the amount of settings that you\n\n153\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.720\nsee and the amount of settings\nthat you can configure.\n\n154\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.187\nSo the next one that we're gonna\nwant to go to is what's called\n\n155\n00:07:46.187 --> 00:07:49.389\nthe Windows Firewall with\nAdvanced Security, and what I\n\n156\n00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:53.408\nlike about this is it is the shortest\nrun line command that Windows has.\n\n157\n00:07:53.408 --> 00:07:58.548\nAnd that's wf.msc, and they've actually\nmade it even easier in Windows 10.\n\n158\n00:07:58.548 --> 00:08:02.893\nNow I don't even have to type\n.msc anymore, so it's just wf, or\n\n159\n00:08:02.893 --> 00:08:04.560\nwhiskey foxtrot there.\n\n160\n00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.770\nAnd I could launch up the Windows\nfirewall with advanced security.\n\n161\n00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.660\nNow, this gives me the ability\nto see things like inbound and\n\n162\n00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.800\noutbound connection rules, right?\n\n163\n00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.290\nIf I can receive a communication but I\ncan't send the communication, I might find\n\n164\n00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.700\nthat there's an outbound rule that was\nmisconfigured for whatever reason.\n\n165\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.630\nCould be doing some kind\nof port blocking here, and\n\n166\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.920\nwe'll get a little bit into\nthe ports coming up here.\n\n167\n00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.820\nBut if a specific port's being\nblocked that we're trying to send\n\n168\n00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.550\ninformation out on,\nIt's gonna block the communication too.\n\n169\n00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.130\nSo inbound and outbound,\nI could check too.\n\n170\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.210\nIf you have any kinda IPsec communications\nthat are going on right here,\n\n171\n00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.790\nyou could find these\nconnection security rules.\n\n172\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.130\nAnd it might be causing the problem,\nit might not be.\n\n173\n00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.720\nBut at least you would have\nthe ability to To check that.\n\n174\n00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.380\nSo Mike I've got, some of the ports,\nlike I mentioned, are pulled up here, and\n\n175\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.850\nyou can get this information\nout to support.office365.com.\n\n176\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:04.460\nThis is a short list of the ports,\nit's not all of the ports.\n\n177\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.220\nBut these a couple of the major\nones that we wanna mention.\n\n178\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.460\nNotice we have SMTP here,\nthe simple mail transfer protocol, well\n\n179\n00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.690\nsome of you guys out there might know,\nin fact Mike, I'm gonna test you here.\n\n180\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.480\n>> Oh.\n>> What port is SMTP?\n\n181\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.290\n>> 25.\n\n182\n00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.310\n>> Port 25, all right.\n\n183\n00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.272\n>> [CROSSTALK] That was close.\n\n184\n00:09:22.272 --> 00:09:23.455\n>> [LAUGH] Very good.\n\n185\n00:09:23.455 --> 00:09:24.155\nVery good.\n\n186\n00:09:24.155 --> 00:09:29.815\nSo maybe, if I'm talking about supporting\ncommunications,maybe I wanna test for\n\n187\n00:09:29.815 --> 00:09:31.895\ninstance, SMTP over Port 25.\n\n188\n00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:34.910\nWell, we can do that.\n\n189\n00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.530\nBut when it comes to logging in and\n\n190\n00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.250\nwe're going to get to the smtp\ncoming up here in a second but\n\n191\n00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.060\nwhen it comes to login, these are the\nprimary ports that you see here, right.\n\n192\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.660\nPort 80 and Port 443 because\nthis is using http and https.\n\n193\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:53.000\nBut we can use a oldie but goodie type\ncommands, It's been around since the days\n\n194\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.590\nof the ARPANET, before it was even called\nthe Internet, and that's good old Telnet.\n\n195\n00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.380\nWe're gonna get into\nusing the Telnet client\n\n196\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.520\nin order to test ports that\nwe're trying to connect to.\n\n197\n00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.840\nNow, you might way, now wait a second,\nTelnet that's an old one there and\n\n198\n00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.780\nI know that we should stay away from\nit right, cuz it's not too secure.\n\n199\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.880\nWell, we're not going to use it to\nactually, for a terminal emulation right,\n\n200\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.850\nwe're not going to make\na remote connection.\n\n201\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.850\nWe're just going to use it to see\nif we can connect to the ports\n\n202\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.160\nthat we're looking for\n\n203\n00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.590\nto make sure that's not a reason that\nmaybe we can't get a communication.\n\n204\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.210\nRemember, I told you, your network\nFirewall's gonna be something that you\n\n205\n00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.130\nmight not be able to be right into and\nconfiguring.\n\n206\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.700\nBut you can at least see,\n\n207\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.930\nfrom your local machine, whether you could\ncommunicate past that network firewall,\n\n208\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.500\nor past that gateway, and\nconnect to those ports out there.\n\n209\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.510\n>> Very good.\n\n210\n00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.740\n>> All right, so\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n211\n00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.480\nFirst thing you have to do, guys, is we're\ngonna turn on the telnet client here.\n\n212\n00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.030\nSo we're gonna go to Programs and\nFeatures,\n\n213\n00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:54.440\nand what I did guys here is just a little\nright click on the Windows logo.\n\n214\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.300\nLet's use Programs and Features, and\n\n215\n00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.820\nthen there's the turn\nWindows features on or off.\n\n216\n00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.770\nAnd we're gonna scroll down.\n\n217\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.760\nAnd you'll see right here\nthere's this telnet client.\n\n218\n00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.320\nAnd we'll choose Okay.\n\n219\n00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.270\nAnd then what it's gonna do, it's gonna\nfind out, do I have all the information,\n\n220\n00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.750\nall the files,\nlocally to make this change.\n\n221\n00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.870\nThank goodness this isn't\nlike the Hyper-V console.\n\n222\n00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.980\nIt doesn't require a restart.\n\n223\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.748\nSome of the features that you turn on-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:11:21.748 --> 00:11:22.783\n>> do require a restart,\n\n225\n00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:23.847\nso it could take a bit.\n\n226\n00:11:23.847 --> 00:11:27.150\nNow the next thing that I'm gonna\ndo here is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n227\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.660\nwhat we're gonna do is\ntest some of these ports.\n\n228\n00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.750\nNow, the information\nthat I have here guys,\n\n229\n00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.260\nis just like when we were using\nthe NS lookup to do name resolution.\n\n230\n00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.120\nThis is the same thing.\n\n231\n00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:44.950\nYou can go out to support.office365.com\nand you can find the communication ports,\n\n232\n00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.520\nor the URL's that Office365 uses, they\nkeep this information up there because if\n\n233\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.240\nyou're a heavily managed environment where\nyour company doesn't allow the computers\n\n234\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.450\nto connect directly to the Internet and\nthey're connecting to a proxy.\n\n235\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.230\nYou would have to have this information,\nthank goodness for\n\n236\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.745\nus it's It's also useful information for\nus in testing communications to see\n\n237\n00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:06.595\nif we maybe have a firewall that\nmight be blocking a certain port and\n\n238\n00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:09.255\nnot letting it communicate\noutbound of our network here.\n\n239\n00:12:09.255 --> 00:12:14.345\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwhat we'll do is we'll do a telnet.\n\n240\n00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:14.955\nAll right.\n\n241\n00:12:14.955 --> 00:12:19.050\nAnd we're gonna use,\nwe'll use a couple of these port here,\n\n242\n00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:19.930\nwe'll show you what it looks like.\n\n243\n00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.160\nSo we'll telnet here and we're gonna do\noutlook.office365.com and we're gonna\n\n244\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.000\ntest port 80.\n\n245\n00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.370\nSo we'll just put an 80 after this and\nwe'll see what we get.\n\n246\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.280\nNow Mike, isn't that absolutely amazing?\n\n247\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.840\nCan you tell me what that mean?\n\n248\n00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.230\n>> That means that your browser is broken.\n\n249\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.862\nNo.\n[LAUGH]\n\n250\n00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:44.220\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n251\n00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.310\n>> I'm kidding.\n\n252\n00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.040\nIt looks like you've established\na connection to port 80.\n\n253\n00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.640\n>> That's right.\n\n254\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.724\nWhen I first used this to test it,\nI was like, okay, that's interesting.\n\n255\n00:12:51.724 --> 00:12:53.169\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What did it do?\n\n256\n00:12:53.169 --> 00:12:56.550\nGuys, if you look at your documentation,\nit's exactly like what Mike said.\n\n257\n00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.490\nIt means that I've made the connection\n\n258\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.580\nvia the telnet client to\nthis machine over that port.\n\n259\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.270\nSo, we've verified that\nport 80 is working.\n\n260\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:10.480\nNow, remember port 80 is\nthe common http port, right?\n\n261\n00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.210\nAnd, software as a service,\nwhat are we using to connect to\n\n262\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.080\nthat platform is the web browser\nthat's communicating over HTTP.\n\n263\n00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.860\nSo, another service in the background.\n\n264\n00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.050\nWe didn't really lump it under services,\nbut it is an important service when you're\n\n265\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:27.100\nusing a web interface to connect to\nthe internet, cuz that is what we need.\n\n266\n00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.790\nNow, let me go ahead and\njust leave this one here.\n\n267\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.714\nWe notice that we do have\nthe connection over port 80.\n\n268\n00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.440\nAll right, i'm gonna do the same thing but\n\n269\n00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.100\nI kinda wanna show you guys what it would\nlook like if you can't communicate.\n\n270\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.230\nRight, it's easy to see\nthe little blinking cursor here.\n\n271\n00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:47.100\nI know that I made a connect,\nwhat would it look like, if I chose to,\n\n272\n00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:53.359\nit didn't connect, so I can do a telnet,\n\n273\n00:13:53.359 --> 00:13:56.010\nI can do an Outlook.office365.com.\n\n274\n00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.990\nMike, give me some random port that you'd\nsay no way in heck should I be able\n\n275\n00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.130\nto connect there.\n\n276\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:02.850\n>> 56.\n>> 56, all right.\n\n277\n00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.530\nAll right, and that's good choice there,\ntoo, cuz it's not connecting.\n\n278\n00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.250\nAnd that's what we wanna see, right?\n\n279\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.200\nBecause the only verification\nthat you even get that\n\n280\n00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.830\nyou are connected is that little\nblinking cursor right there.\n\n281\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.220\nMike got it right off the bat.\n\n282\n00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.160\nAnd I can tell you when I first started\nusing it, I'd go back to TechNet and say,\n\n283\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:20.910\nwhat is it doing?\n\n284\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.810\nIs it working or not?\n\n285\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.550\nSo we're gonna let this one sit here and\nconnect here.\n\n286\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.080\nThe other one that's important\nis hypertext transfer protocol,\n\n287\n00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.600\nhttps, so over secure socket layer and\nI believe they're using TLS.\n\n288\n00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.090\nBut whether it's SSL or\n\n289\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.860\nit's TLS it's still the https protocol and\ngoes over port 443.\n\n290\n00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.880\nSo we also have to verify that one, right.\n\n291\n00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.710\nEvery time you connect to the portal\ndot Office.com, I had to check\n\n292\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:51.020\nmyself on that one, it's https, so it's\ngonna be an important protocol or port to\n\n293\n00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.870\nbe able to connect to when you're trying\nto troubleshoot online connectivity.\n\n294\n00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.340\nLet's go ahead and do that here.\n\n295\n00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:04.190\nWe'll do telnet office and,\nthen we'll do the 365 again, dot com.\n\n296\n00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.570\nOh, no, that's Outlook, excuse me.\n\n297\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.856\nYeah, over redundant Office there.\n\n298\n00:15:12.482 --> 00:15:15.775\nIt doesn't help, it's not redundancy\nif you type it incorrectly.\n\n299\n00:15:15.775 --> 00:15:18.105\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No matter how many times.\n\n300\n00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:21.345\nAll right, we'll do 443, and there we go.\n\n301\n00:15:21.345 --> 00:15:26.195\nSo notice that we've got a couple\nof them going on here, and\n\n302\n00:15:26.195 --> 00:15:28.735\n56 there Mike does it look\nlike it's connecting here.\n\n303\n00:15:28.735 --> 00:15:32.655\nSo I've got, this one you can't really\ntell, this is port 80, right, and\n\n304\n00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:33.315\nthis is port 443.\n\n305\n00:15:33.315 --> 00:15:36.313\nAnd we're getting our little\nblinking cursor there, so\n\n306\n00:15:36.313 --> 00:15:39.809\nit's letting me know that those\nports aren't being blocked, and\n\n307\n00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:44.075\nbecause those ports aren't being blocked,\nI know outbound I can communicate.\n\n308\n00:15:44.075 --> 00:15:47.699\nSo at this point, we've checked\nsome of the major services, right?\n\n309\n00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:51.438\nWe've checked DNS,\nwe've checked the DHCP server,\n\n310\n00:15:51.438 --> 00:15:55.021\nour default gateway We run\nname resolution checks.\n\n311\n00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:58.465\nRight, so if we're still not getting\nconnectivity the next thing that we went\n\n312\n00:15:58.465 --> 00:16:01.282\ninto is just double check the firewall and\nsome of the settings,\n\n313\n00:16:01.282 --> 00:16:03.340\nwhether it's inbound, outbound settings.\n\n314\n00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.560\nMaking sure you don't have things\nlike encryption requirements\n\n315\n00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.370\non your communications, right?\n\n316\n00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.680\nAnd now what we've done is said,\nwell let's look at the ports themselves.\n\n317\n00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.920\nAre the ports being blocked\nat the firewall level?\n\n318\n00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.360\nI can see something locally here, right,\nI can see the Window's firewall, but\n\n319\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.940\nwhat I can't do is connect to that\nnetwork-based firewall to ensure\n\n320\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.060\nthat it's not causing the problem too.\n\n321\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.470\nSo looks like we've got\nour communications,\n\n322\n00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:25.890\nlooks like our ports are running good.\n\n323\n00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.460\nSo we move along in\nthe troubleshooting process.\n\n324\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:35.607\n>> Absolutely, and notice that all\nthese tools we've been using to test,\n\n325\n00:16:35.607 --> 00:16:40.360\nping are a lot of stuff from\nthe command prompt, right?\n\n326\n00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.206\nWe did IP config, NS look up, we used\nTelNet to connect to some ports, so\n\n327\n00:16:44.206 --> 00:16:45.908\nall that looks really good, but\n\n328\n00:16:45.908 --> 00:16:49.333\nin the end, how does my user\nactually connect to Office 365?\n\n329\n00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:50.901\nWe use an application, right?\n\n330\n00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:54.834\nThey use their web browser, and then they\nopen up their favorite browser of choice\n\n331\n00:16:54.834 --> 00:16:57.123\nand they type in that URL and\nthey go to connect.\n\n332\n00:16:57.123 --> 00:16:59.700\nAnd even if all the other\nsettings are correct,\n\n333\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.902\nmy browser itself could have some\nsettings that cause problems, right Wes?\n\n334\n00:17:03.902 --> 00:17:07.815\n>> That's exactly right because\nagain from a managed standpoint,\n\n335\n00:17:07.815 --> 00:17:11.880\nnow you might say, well Wes,\nwhat do you mean managed standpoint?\n\n336\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.580\nIsn't everything in IT managed?\n\n337\n00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.885\nYou're right, the answer's right, but what\nI mean heavily managed you might have some\n\n338\n00:17:16.885 --> 00:17:20.680\nkinda security compliance,\nyou might be under, what is it,\n\n339\n00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:25.010\nthe Federal Information Security Act,\nFISMA, or something like that.\n\n340\n00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.400\nYou might be on foreign soils,\nnow I say foreign soils you guys,\n\n341\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.580\nit's cuz we're here in the States.\n\n342\n00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.950\nIf you're in the UK,\nwe might be foreign soils to you, but\n\n343\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.300\nit might be the EU model clause or\nsomething that you're under.\n\n344\n00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.130\nAnd you got some kinda security\ncompliance that says, hey,\n\n345\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.330\nyour internal workstations cannot connect\ndirectly the the Internet, right?\n\n346\n00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.290\nWe have to screen ever process which means\nthat they have to go through a proxy.\n\n347\n00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.438\nSo, misconfigured proxy settings\ncould cause a problem as well, and\n\n348\n00:17:49.438 --> 00:17:52.380\nlet me show you where you can find\nthose inside of Internet Explorer here.\n\n349\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.980\nSo I just got Internet Explorer opened up.\n\n350\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.350\nIf it comes to the browser that you're\nusing, whether you're using Chrome,\n\n351\n00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.570\nwhether you're using Firefox, if you\nhappen to be using Microsoft's Edge,\n\n352\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:02.802\npay attention to those settings here.\n\n353\n00:18:02.802 --> 00:18:06.180\nWe're gonna look at Internet Explorer\nhere, cuz it's one of the most heavily\n\n354\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:12.310\nsupported web browsers when it comes\nto using it to connect to Office 365,\n\n355\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.770\nand it's MTA so we're going to\nuse Microsoft's technology here.\n\n356\n00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.660\nBut again, it does support\nthings like Chrome and Firefox.\n\n357\n00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.092\nAnd we can go to the Internet options and\nI kinda jumped around there real quick,\n\n358\n00:18:22.092 --> 00:18:23.250\nlet me make sure you guys see that.\n\n359\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.530\nLittle gear icon, there's a few\ndifferent ways you can get to this,\n\n360\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.038\nif I right, oops, or you can leave it.\n\n361\n00:18:31.038 --> 00:18:34.870\nIf I right-click on\nthe little menu bar icon or\n\n362\n00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.230\nlocation here, I can choose menu bar.\n\n363\n00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:41.790\nAnd some of you maybe have been\naround since IE7, 8, and 9.\n\n364\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.020\nMaybe you like this little menu bar,\nand I can get to Internet options here.\n\n365\n00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:50.990\nI like it fast, a fast way to get\nthere is just a little gear icon,\n\n366\n00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.250\nwe can go to Internet options.\n\n367\n00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.690\nAnd then the next thing I can do\nis I can check my connections.\n\n368\n00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:00.400\nAll right, if I'm setting up different\ntypes of connections for instance,\n\n369\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.400\nconnecting to the Internet here,\nI can set this up.\n\n370\n00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.560\nAnd this is no different then what you\nwould do in the, oop, the Setwork and\n\n371\n00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.260\nSharing Center.\n\n372\n00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.440\nLet me close that down,\ndecided to disappear on me.\n\n373\n00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.880\nAll right, so\nif you do end up having issues,\n\n374\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.990\nif you have VPN connections,\nyou can set that here as well.\n\n375\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.820\nAnd then you also have your LAN Settings\nand LAN Settings are things\n\n376\n00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.630\nautomatic configuration under\nyour proxy settings here.\n\n377\n00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.710\nNow the proxy settings\nare important because\n\n378\n00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.980\nnotice that by default it says port 80.\n\n379\n00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.140\nWell you might have multiple web\nservers that I might've said\n\n380\n00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.670\nthe proxy port number might have\nbeen a little bit different.\n\n381\n00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.465\nMike, I think they use\nonly 8080 sometimes.\n\n382\n00:19:37.465 --> 00:19:40.850\n>> 8080 is a common one but a lot of\npeople wanna change that to something\n\n383\n00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.670\nthat's unique to their environment\njust as a security reason.\n\n384\n00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.735\nAnd remember, if your company\nis running a proxy as Wes said,\n\n385\n00:19:47.735 --> 00:19:52.581\nall traffic flows I should say,\nthrough that proxy out to the Internet and\n\n386\n00:19:52.581 --> 00:19:54.868\nback so they can do whatever it is.\n\n387\n00:19:54.868 --> 00:19:57.894\nThey can analyze it, they can control\nwhat protocols are allowed, and\n\n388\n00:19:57.894 --> 00:19:58.710\nthings like that.\n\n389\n00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.273\nSo, if you've misconfigured your proxy\nsettings everything else could be working\n\n390\n00:20:02.273 --> 00:20:04.581\njust fine, but\nwhen you go to send that data outbound,\n\n391\n00:20:04.581 --> 00:20:07.208\nif it doesn't go through the proxy,\nit's got nowhere to go.\n\n392\n00:20:07.208 --> 00:20:09.860\nSo you've gotta make sure\nthese settings are correct.\n\n393\n00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.740\n>> Yeah, it's setting a call-out\nto a device that, well,\n\n394\n00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.510\nit's not listening in that direction,\nso no communication, so.\n\n395\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.335\nPay attention to\nthe Internet Explorer browser and\n\n396\n00:20:19.335 --> 00:20:23.410\nagain I should say the Internet\noptions within Internet Explorer and\n\n397\n00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.295\nmake sure that that's\nnot causing a problem.\n\n398\n00:20:26.295 --> 00:20:28.770\nAgain, if you have in a managed\nenvironment like this,\n\n399\n00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.260\nyou might also have to worry about some of\nthose URLs that we were talking about, and\n\n400\n00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:38.020\nI know I keep going back to\nthat URL list guys, a lot here.\n\n401\n00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.750\nBut it is important and let me bring\nthat back up so we can look at that.\n\n402\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.710\nThese URLs might be blocked.\n\n403\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:50.371\nAgain, some corporate security policy\nmight be standing, the bureaucracy,\n\n404\n00:20:50.371 --> 00:20:52.470\n[LAUGH] if you will,\nis standing in the way.\n\n405\n00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.500\nNot necessarily the network communication,\nso\n\n406\n00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.350\nwhat we would have to do is\nwe'd have to get the URLs and\n\n407\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.630\nwe could go to a location inside\nof Internet options, yet again.\n\n408\n00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:06.350\nAnd then we would go\nto our security zones.\n\n409\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.540\nOur security zones, just in case that\nmaybe, again, you've got a very strict\n\n410\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.200\npolicy that's got these settings up on\nhigh and it is blocking communications.\n\n411\n00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:21.216\nWell at this point what I could do is I\ncould take these URLs that we have here,\n\n412\n00:21:21.216 --> 00:21:25.549\nso for\ninstance maybe Outlook.Office365.com.\n\n413\n00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:30.596\nAnd I can put this in my Trusted sites and\nwe'll go ahead and do that, and\n\n414\n00:21:30.596 --> 00:21:35.563\nI'm gonna uncheck the Require server\nverification, and then I can do\n\n415\n00:21:35.563 --> 00:21:40.978\nsomething like this where I do https,\nremember it does connect over HTTPS.\n\n416\n00:21:40.978 --> 00:21:47.687\nAnd then I can I believe put\nthe wildcard there, office365.com.\n\n417\n00:21:47.687 --> 00:21:49.415\nAnd once I add that,\n\n418\n00:21:49.415 --> 00:21:54.706\nthen what it's telling me is that\nthis is the parent domain and\n\n419\n00:21:54.706 --> 00:22:00.330\nanything say below the parent\ndomain now is going to be accepted.\n\n420\n00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:06.169\nNotice that I don't have to worry about\nis it SMTP, Office, or .office365.com.\n\n421\n00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:11.036\nI don't have to worry about is it\noutllook.office365.com, cuz what I've said\n\n422\n00:22:11.036 --> 00:22:15.971\nis we're using office365.com and I don't\ncare about the various services here,\n\n423\n00:22:15.971 --> 00:22:20.159\nI just wanna make sure that that domain\nis now trusted so that the browser if\n\n424\n00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:24.510\nit's trying for security purposes to\nblock things like ActiveX controls.\n\n425\n00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:29.065\nAnd you don't really I don't think have to\nworry about things like Java Scriptlets,\n\n426\n00:22:29.065 --> 00:22:33.179\nbut anything that might for security\npurposes be blocked or maybe even reduce\n\n427\n00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:37.840\nthe functionality of the experience inside\nof Office 365, is no longer the case.\n\n428\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.600\nAnd it could be one of the reasons that\nyou're not getting any connection,\n\n429\n00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.710\nso pay attention to your URLs out there.\n\n430\n00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.480\nRemember, just go out to\nsupport.office365.com,\n\n431\n00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:52.090\nthey've got an entire database of\nthe office365 URLs, and IP addresses,\n\n432\n00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.040\nso that if this is the case, you'll have\nthe ability to take that information,\n\n433\n00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.420\ncome back, put these in your\nbrowsers in the Trusted sites.\n\n434\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.798\nNow, I did this more of\na decentralized method.\n\n435\n00:23:03.798 --> 00:23:08.640\nMost likely, [LAUGH] well I can't say\nmost likely, you will not be doing\n\n436\n00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.288\nthis 300 times, 1,000, times,\n3,000, times to all the browsers.\n\n437\n00:23:13.288 --> 00:23:17.870\nYou're probably gonna be using some\nkind of configuration technology,\n\n438\n00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.980\nmost likely it's gonna be something like\nActive Directory because you can set it\n\n439\n00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.460\none time in the policy.\n\n440\n00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.150\nYou can divide it up according\nto geographical location, and\n\n441\n00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.700\nyou can make sure and\nensure that those settings are pushed out\n\n442\n00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.530\nto multiple end users and\nyou get the centralized administration.\n\n443\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:36.240\nBut at least you know where\nthe settings are, and for the MTA exam\n\n444\n00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.920\nI would know the fact that maybe\nthe Trusted sites might come into play.\n\n445\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.990\nInternet options as well as some of\nthe configurations via the proxy\n\n446\n00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.190\nmight come into play as well.\n\n447\n00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:49.065\nI wouldn't worry too much about the Active\nDirectory side of it, but we wouldn't\n\n448\n00:23:49.065 --> 00:23:52.595\nbe doing you any justice if you thought\nyou had to do this 30,000 times.\n\n449\n00:23:52.595 --> 00:23:54.725\nYou'd be using Active Directory policy,\nright?\n\n450\n00:23:54.725 --> 00:23:55.233\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n451\n00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:58.551\nAll right, Wes,\na lot of great information there,\n\n452\n00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:03.382\ncontinuing that look at troubleshooting or\nsupporting those cloud users,\n\n453\n00:24:03.382 --> 00:24:07.382\nmaking sure that from their\nmachine that they're sitting at,\n\n454\n00:24:07.382 --> 00:24:11.474\nthey can reach out and\ntalk to that Office 365, in this case.\n\n455\n00:24:11.474 --> 00:24:13.656\nSo, and I know we got a few more\nthings we're gonna go over,\n\n456\n00:24:13.656 --> 00:24:16.716\nwe gotta start looking at the applications\nthemselves, if they're running, and\n\n457\n00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:19.951\na few are a higher level troubleshooting\nmethodologies, but unfortunately we're out\n\n458\n00:24:19.951 --> 00:24:23.360\nof time in this particular episode, so\nwe're gonna have to call it there, Wes.\n\n459\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.675\nHopefully you'll come back and\nhelp us the rest of the way.\n\n460\n00:24:25.675 --> 00:24:28.185\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n461\n00:24:28.185 --> 00:24:29.715\nSigning off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n462\n00:24:29.715 --> 00:24:31.267\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n463\n00:24:31.267 --> 00:24:33.634\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n464\n00:24:33.634 --> 00:24:37.110\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.440\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.060\nToday we're doing our\nMTA Cloud Fundamentals and\n\n5\n00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.550\nspecifically in this episode, we're gonna\nbe looking at supporting our cloud users.\n\n6\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.820\nNow, if you missed the other episodes,\nthis is a part three.\n\n7\n00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.700\nThis is a continuation\nof our conversation.\n\n8\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.260\nAnd in this one we're gonna head into,\n\n9\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.610\nwe've looked at some basic network\nconnectivity cuz, obviously, if we're\n\n10\n00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.980\ngonna connect to cloud services, we've\ngotta be able to connect to the network.\n\n11\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.360\nWe've gotta be able to connect\nout there to the internet.\n\n12\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.820\nBut once we've got all that,\n\n13\n00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.490\nthere's still some more things\nwe need to troubleshoot, right?\n\n14\n00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.090\nThe applications themselves, whether\nthey're running out there in the cloud or\n\n15\n00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.100\nwhether we want to install them locally.\n\n16\n00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.320\nAnd here to help us with that of course\nis, the Office 365 master, Mr. Wes Brian.\n\n17\n00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.910\nHow's it going Wes?\n\n18\n00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.570\n>> It's going great.\n\n19\n00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.520\nAnd it's great to be here.\n\n20\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.250\nAnd that's right,\nwe're gonna be moving on and\n\n21\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.950\nwe do have to make sure we're\ngonna differentiate whether\n\n22\n00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.460\nyou're using the online Office apps or,\nwhether you're using a local installation.\n\n23\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.580\nNow when we talk about the online web\ninterface, go back and look at the first\n\n24\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.560\ncouple parts of this episode here because\nwe talk about some of the basic connection\n\n25\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.790\nissues that you have to worry about, and\neven troubleshooting the web browser.\n\n26\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.950\nWhen you're using the online apps,\n\n27\n00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.760\nthis is really where you're\ntroubleshooting's gonna lie.\n\n28\n00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.760\nIt's going to be basic connectivity\nissues, it's gonna be the web browser.\n\n29\n00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.730\nBut it is a little bit different when\nyou start talking about installing\n\n30\n00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.230\nthem locally, like Mike mentioned.\n\n31\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.767\nWell, what's Mike talking about\nwhen he says local installation?\n\n32\n00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:40.353\nWell, that's gonna be no different\nthan any traditional installation\n\n33\n00:01:40.353 --> 00:01:43.187\nin the Office Suite that you\nmaybe you used it in the past.\n\n34\n00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:50.205\nMaybe you've used the older 2003,\nthe 2007, 2010, 2013, and wow, now 2016.\n\n35\n00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:52.035\n>> Yeah.\n>> My goodness, how time flies.\n\n36\n00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:54.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And really, this is no difference.\n\n37\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.251\nBecause the only difference is,\nis you're gonna connect to Office\n\n38\n00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:03.390\n365 to download the applications,\nand that's where we have to start.\n\n39\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.017\nSo if we're having a problem\nduring the local installation,\n\n40\n00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:09.257\ncheck connection problems, right?\n\n41\n00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:10.879\nBecause even though I told you,\n\n42\n00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.916\nreally your connection problems are where\nthe online web apps are going to lie.\n\n43\n00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:17.654\nWell, you still have to make\na connection to Office 365,\n\n44\n00:02:17.654 --> 00:02:20.284\nyou have to log in first and\nthen you have to install it, and\n\n45\n00:02:20.284 --> 00:02:22.506\nits going to download\nlocally to your computer.\n\n46\n00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:25.129\nSo always start with those\nconnection problems and\n\n47\n00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.606\ndefinitely go back and check the first\npart of this episode out cuz we\n\n48\n00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.778\nreally looked at some of the different\nthings that you could do\n\n49\n00:02:31.778 --> 00:02:35.077\nthat with those connection\nproblems to troubleshooting them.\n\n50\n00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:39.520\nNow, the other thing that we have\nto look at too are the media.\n\n51\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.850\nWe have to look at the media, and\nwe have to look at product keys, and\n\n52\n00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.050\nthat's gonna be important, right?\n\n53\n00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.980\nWhen you install your software locally,\nyou typically have to activate it, right?\n\n54\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.965\nWell, the first thing that we need\nto do if we're gonna troubleshoot\n\n55\n00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:53.612\nthe installation of an application,\n\n56\n00:02:53.612 --> 00:02:56.866\nwe have to make sure that we have\nthe right installation going out the gate.\n\n57\n00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:02.200\nIf you have a 32-bit platform and you try\nto download a 64-bit operating system,\n\n58\n00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.398\nnot operating system, excuse me.\n\n59\n00:03:04.398 --> 00:03:07.827\n64-bit edition of\nthe Office Professional Plus,\n\n60\n00:03:07.827 --> 00:03:12.704\nwell the problem is it doesn't install,\n64-bit isn't gonna install on\n\n61\n00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:16.758\na 32-bit operating system, so\nwe do have to pay attention.\n\n62\n00:03:16.758 --> 00:03:18.882\nNow, it can work the other way,\n\n63\n00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:24.256\nyou can install a 32-bit instance of\nthe Office Suite on a 64-bit machine.\n\n64\n00:03:24.256 --> 00:03:28.630\nAnd we'll look at some of the benefits and\nthe pros and cons of that coming up.\n\n65\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.410\nSo make sure that it's architectural.\n\n66\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.360\nYou know, or what the CPU or\nthe competing architecture is.\n\n67\n00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.790\nWhether it's 32-bit or 64-bit because\nthat's gonna be where you have to start.\n\n68\n00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.480\nThe next thing that we have to, once we\ndetermine what the media is we have to\n\n69\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.650\nmake sure that we have\nthe right product key.\n\n70\n00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.128\nAll right, the product key can cause\nproblems when it comes to activation.\n\n71\n00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:53.295\nRemember that part of your license is an\nongoing activation to those applications,\n\n72\n00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:56.933\nand if they're not activated they could\neven go into things like a reduced\n\n73\n00:03:56.933 --> 00:03:57.827\nfunctionality.\n\n74\n00:03:57.827 --> 00:04:01.370\nSo let's show you where\nyou can troubleshoot that.\n\n75\n00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.320\nAnd even put that into place.\n\n76\n00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.520\nTo do this,\nonce you've installed it locally,\n\n77\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.860\nyou can go up to your Programs location.\n\n78\n00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.360\nSo I'm just gonna right-click\non the Windows icon here.\n\n79\n00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.889\nChoose Programs and Features.\n\n80\n00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.140\nAll right, and then we are going to look\nfor our Office Professional Plus 2013,\n\n81\n00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.360\nand I want you to pay attention, cuz we've\ngot a couple of options here, right?\n\n82\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.060\nWe've got Organize, we've got Install, and\n\n83\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.490\nthen Change the installation\nof this program.\n\n84\n00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.710\nWell, you might be thinking,\nwait a second, I don't really wanna change\n\n85\n00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.760\nthe installation, I just wanna\nactivate the application itself.\n\n86\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.100\nSo don't let that confuse you.\n\n87\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.500\nAnd especially on the MTA exam, if they\nask you what buttons do you have to click.\n\n88\n00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.650\nYeah, cuz they could ask you that.\n\n89\n00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.880\nThey could give you a text-based question\nthat's a, with text-based answers.\n\n90\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.263\nThey're all text-based questions.\n\n91\n00:04:54.263 --> 00:04:59.150\n[LAUGH] Text-based answer that says you\nneed to go to Programs and Features.\n\n92\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.810\nYou need to click the Change button.\n\n93\n00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.490\nKnow that that's where we're gonna start.\n\n94\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.049\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n95\n00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.846\nAl right.\nAnd now a couple different options.\n\n96\n00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:11.013\nWe'll look at some of the,\nwe'll look at this repair coming up,\n\n97\n00:05:11.013 --> 00:05:15.278\ncuz that's gonna be important too when it\ncomes to troubleshooting the Office 365,\n\n98\n00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:18.770\nor in this case,\nOffice Professional Plus installation.\n\n99\n00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.610\nAnd I can choose enter a product key\nright here, and I can choose continue.\n\n100\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.230\nNow if you got the wrong product key,\nyou won't be able to activate and\n\n101\n00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.110\nwe can actually show you that,\nI've got the product key back here.\n\n102\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.229\nAll right, all those crazy long, what is\nit, 25-character key that you'll love to\n\n103\n00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.367\nenter, don't worry, this puts the dashes\nfor you and we'll go ahead and\n\n104\n00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:43.660\nwe're gonna use our paste option here.\n\n105\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.230\nNow, notice that we have an issue.\n\n106\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.330\nAll right, it's telling me right away\nthat this product key isn't valid for\n\n107\n00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.690\nOffice 2013.\n\n108\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.860\nWell, that's gonna be a problem for\nme, right?\n\n109\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.180\nSo when you talk about activation,\nyou have to make sure that you\n\n110\n00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.040\nhave the right key, and the key is\ndirectly related to your subscription.\n\n111\n00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.665\nSo let's say that Mike has a tenant and\nI have a tenant in Office 365,\n\n112\n00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:10.147\nMike just happens to have Contoso,\nI have Fabrikam.\n\n113\n00:06:10.147 --> 00:06:14.826\nNow, the problem is, or\nwhere the issue could reside, is if I,\n\n114\n00:06:14.826 --> 00:06:19.611\nlet's say I let him use one of my\nlaptops for his company, right?\n\n115\n00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:23.688\nAnd he installs Office 365,\nI forget that he, hey, thanks,\n\n116\n00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:28.657\nyou've installed Office 365,\nI see 365 Office Professional Plus, and\n\n117\n00:06:28.657 --> 00:06:32.270\nthen I use one of my keys,\njust like this right here.\n\n118\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.580\nI used one of my activation keys.\n\n119\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.300\nAnd it's gonna tell me that's not valid.\n\n120\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.580\nWell, why isn't it valid?\n\n121\n00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.262\nKeep in mind that your\nsubscription status, your tenant,\n\n122\n00:06:41.262 --> 00:06:46.105\nall your license,\nthey are unique to your company.\n\n123\n00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:49.145\nMike's tenant, he's not gonna be able\nto use his subscription license within\n\n124\n00:06:49.145 --> 00:06:50.895\nmy tenant, and vice versa.\n\n125\n00:06:50.895 --> 00:06:56.295\nSo it is specific to whatever your\ncompany is, you can't just mix and\n\n126\n00:06:56.295 --> 00:07:00.385\nmatch them, it does cause problems as you\ncan see here, I would get an error and\n\n127\n00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:04.975\nI would not be able to activate\nOffice Professional Plus here.\n\n128\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.610\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna cancel this setup.\n\n129\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.790\nAll right, now we've talked about basic\nconnection problems already, right?\n\n130\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.410\nYeah, you're internet connection problem,\nthat could be an issue too.\n\n131\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.670\nThe other thing that I want you to pay\nattention to is license exhaustion.\n\n132\n00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.130\nIn fact, and Mikey,\nyou know you and I have worked for\n\n133\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.840\na company in the past\nthat had this problem.\n\n134\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.510\nWe were doing deployment with WSUS and\n\n135\n00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.630\none of the things, I believe you were\nthe administrator that set this up.\n\n136\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.680\nWe were using the volume activation\nmanagement toolkit, vamped and\n\n137\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.150\nit was connected to our WSUS server.\n\n138\n00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:47.070\nAnd, it would, what would end up happening\nis all of our machines were activating,\n\n139\n00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.390\nwe were trying to get it set up.\n\n140\n00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.066\nThey were supposed to connect to the vamp\nserver, and we didn't have to worry about\n\n141\n00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:55.704\nthem individually going out\nto Microsoft and activating.\n\n142\n00:07:55.704 --> 00:08:00.402\nWell the problem is, with using something\nlike a multiple activation key like that,\n\n143\n00:08:00.402 --> 00:08:04.725\nwe ended up exhausting all those keys and\nwe weren't even aware of it, right?\n\n144\n00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:05.654\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n145\n00:08:05.654 --> 00:08:08.654\nBut I mean the individual\nactivations that we had,\n\n146\n00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:12.300\nwe just chewed right through them and\nwe didn't even know it.\n\n147\n00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.790\nBefore we knew it all these machines were\nactivating, and then we would reimage them\n\n148\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.760\nin a week, and that's potential for\nabout up to 100 activations that could be\n\n149\n00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.120\ncompletely wasted because the fact that we\nturned around and reimaged the machines.\n\n150\n00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.140\nNow you have to worry about a license\nexhaustion here in Office 365,\n\n151\n00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.250\nand let me show you what\nI mean here by that.\n\n152\n00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.500\nIf I go ahead and decide, you know what,\n\n153\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.006\nI think I'm gonna create\nan additional user, all right?\n\n154\n00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:41.720\nSo I've already got my\nusers in place here, right?\n\n155\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.604\nWe've got Janis Joplin here, Jimi Hendrix,\nwe've got some conference rooms,\n\n156\n00:08:46.604 --> 00:08:50.513\nbut I'm gonna go ahead and\nwhat I'm gonna do is add another user.\n\n157\n00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:55.266\nAnd I see I've got User 10 down there,\nwe'll call this User 20 and\n\n158\n00:08:55.266 --> 00:09:00.100\nwe'll say same thing here, User 20,\nusername's gonna be, well,\n\n159\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.103\nUser 20 again because I am that creative.\n\n160\n00:09:03.103 --> 00:09:03.998\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And,\n\n161\n00:09:03.998 --> 00:09:08.261\nremember we said that we've got\nan onboarding process, so we're gonna go\n\n162\n00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:12.202\nahead and set a generic password\nwithout Microsoft naming it for us.\n\n163\n00:09:12.202 --> 00:09:17.441\nBut what I really care about and\nespecially as it pertains to this episode,\n\n164\n00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:20.863\nnotice that we've got\nlicense available here.\n\n165\n00:09:20.863 --> 00:09:25.297\nAll right, see what was happening to us at\nthat company is that we were setting it up\n\n166\n00:09:25.297 --> 00:09:28.854\nto where we could manage these\nactivations internally, right?\n\n167\n00:09:28.854 --> 00:09:32.193\nBut what happened was, the computers\nwere connecting out to Microsoft and\n\n168\n00:09:32.193 --> 00:09:33.736\nwe didn't realize this, right?\n\n169\n00:09:33.736 --> 00:09:38.844\nSo before we knew it, we had lost and\nexpended all of those activations,\n\n170\n00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:43.562\nand we didn't have any additional\nlicenses or activations left.\n\n171\n00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:48.351\nWell you have to understand that your\nlicense status is based on how many users\n\n172\n00:09:48.351 --> 00:09:52.847\nhave downloaded Office and then\nactivated them inside of your company,\n\n173\n00:09:52.847 --> 00:09:55.516\nnow we've got to try a license here, too.\n\n174\n00:09:55.516 --> 00:09:58.250\nSo it starts off with 25 and\nthat's the maximum, but\n\n175\n00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.125\nif you've got something like, for\ninstance, the business plans, right?\n\n176\n00:10:02.125 --> 00:10:07.123\nYou have a maximum of 300 users, you\ndon't really have to worry about this too\n\n177\n00:10:07.123 --> 00:10:11.094\nmuch in the enterprise level plans,\nE1E,Three, and E five,\n\n178\n00:10:11.094 --> 00:10:15.090\nthey're all unlimited users, so\nyour license are good there.\n\n179\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:19.196\nBut If you're in a smaller\nbusiness plan or in like this,\n\n180\n00:10:19.196 --> 00:10:24.671\nwhere your in a trial plan here, notice\nthat I can expend this license very,\n\n181\n00:10:24.671 --> 00:10:27.947\nvery quick, 25 and I don't have any more.\n\n182\n00:10:27.947 --> 00:10:30.215\nNow Intune's a little bit different but,\nat the same time,\n\n183\n00:10:30.215 --> 00:10:31.691\nwe do have to worry about this, right?\n\n184\n00:10:31.691 --> 00:10:36.031\nIf we have mobile devices, the exponential\ngrowth of BYOD today, I mean I've got five\n\n185\n00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:40.490\ndevices myself that could potentially need\nlicense, and that's just on a single user,\n\n186\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:45.143\nyou multiply that by 300, now you got 1500\nlicense that could be gone just like that.\n\n187\n00:10:45.143 --> 00:10:49.699\nSo you definitely have to look at your\nlicense, make sure that you have available\n\n188\n00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:52.848\nlicense because if you're\nnot being able to activate,\n\n189\n00:10:52.848 --> 00:10:54.733\nthat could be one of the reasons.\n\n190\n00:10:54.733 --> 00:11:01.701\nNow another way that this could\nhappen too is your users, right?\n\n191\n00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:04.897\nOne of the good things is that\nwhen you delete your users,\n\n192\n00:11:04.897 --> 00:11:09.491\nkind of like an active directory where it\ntombstones a user, it keeps them there so\n\n193\n00:11:09.491 --> 00:11:12.822\nyou don't just delete the identity\nout of your database and\n\n194\n00:11:12.822 --> 00:11:16.450\nthen lose all access to everything\nthat that identity created.\n\n195\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.630\nIt does the same thing here in Office 365,\nso notice my User 10 here,\n\n196\n00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.880\nif I decide that User 10 is no\nlonger going to be in my network and\n\n197\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.620\nI don't want that license\nto get chewed up, right?\n\n198\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.450\nMaybe I'm down to five license and\n\n199\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.130\nI want to accrue that license back because\nUser 10's no longer a part of my company,\n\n200\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:40.500\nwell then what I do is I go in here and\nI delete the user, all right?\n\n201\n00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.530\nAnd here they tell us right\naway when you delete the users,\n\n202\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.700\ntheir data is deleted, and their\nlicense can be assigned to other users.\n\n203\n00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.509\nAll right, now gives me a period of time,\n\n204\n00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:53.525\nlike we've talked about in other\nepisodes on user management here.\n\n205\n00:11:53.525 --> 00:11:57.199\nBut it gives me a period of time if I\nsay okay, well User 10 came back and\n\n206\n00:11:57.199 --> 00:12:01.271\nI want to reactivate, reinstate,\nreactivate this account, I'll be okay.\n\n207\n00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:06.019\nBut the important thing here is,\nmake sure, especially if you're in a trial\n\n208\n00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:11.356\nsituation, that you don't inadvertently\nexhaust these licenses because you forgot\n\n209\n00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:17.272\nto delete the users and move them from the\nactive location to the deleted location.\n\n210\n00:12:17.272 --> 00:12:19.789\nAll right and\nI can see User 2 here, laptop,\n\n211\n00:12:19.789 --> 00:12:23.433\nnow I didn't follow through with that so\nthat wouldn't be good,\n\n212\n00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:26.561\nlet me follow through with this so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n213\n00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:31.119\nSo I'm gonna delete and I'm gonna\ngo ahead and say yeah, go ahead and\n\n214\n00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:33.172\ndelete that user, all right?\n\n215\n00:12:33.172 --> 00:12:38.362\nAnd we choose close, and now I'm gonna\ngo back and I'm gonna recreate a user.\n\n216\n00:12:38.362 --> 00:12:42.614\nI know we're kinda jumping back and\nforth here on the user interface.\n\n217\n00:12:42.614 --> 00:12:47.602\nAnd what that will do is that will\nput back in that pool of license,\n\n218\n00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:51.332\nan additional license for\nOffice that I can use.\n\n219\n00:12:51.332 --> 00:12:54.220\nNow it might not happen right away\nbecause this is a Cloud service,\n\n220\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.862\nyou gotta update the database,\nit's fairly quick though.\n\n221\n00:12:56.862 --> 00:12:59.956\nBut then I accrue that license back and\n\n222\n00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:05.659\nI don't have to worry about it like\nI did when they had that software and\n\n223\n00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:10.315\nit was licensed to them, so\nthat's a good thing to have.\n\n224\n00:13:10.315 --> 00:13:13.656\nAs far as subscription goes,\nI do what to make mention of that,\n\n225\n00:13:13.656 --> 00:13:18.019\npay attention to your subscription status\nas well, that's gonna be important.\n\n226\n00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:23.127\nYou need to know how long\nyour subscription is,\n\n227\n00:13:23.127 --> 00:13:27.594\nit is valid for, and let me get down here,\n\n228\n00:13:27.594 --> 00:13:33.083\npurchase services, and\nI can see that in my trial,\n\n229\n00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:36.418\nright, I have 25 days left.\n\n230\n00:13:36.418 --> 00:13:39.903\nIf you are paying on the business plan,\nremember you can pay monthly versus\n\n231\n00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:43.664\nannually, which is something that,\nit's gonna be some ongoing maintenance,\n\n232\n00:13:43.664 --> 00:13:46.229\nyou gotta pay attention to\nthat subscription status.\n\n233\n00:13:46.229 --> 00:13:50.593\nIf you subscribe to the business annual,\nthen it's a little bit easier, it's once\n\n234\n00:13:50.593 --> 00:13:54.895\na year, and then remember the enterprise\nlevel business plans are only annually so\n\n235\n00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:57.685\nyou really only have to check\nthat status once a year.\n\n236\n00:13:57.685 --> 00:14:00.770\nSo a couple of things that we gotta pay\nattention to is why applications won't\n\n237\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.820\nactivate, and\nwhy applications won't install.\n\n238\n00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.410\nCheck your media, make sure that you've\ngot the right media for what you need,\n\n239\n00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.140\narchitecture wise, also make sure\nthat you have the right product key,\n\n240\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.490\nlicense exhaustion, and\nsubscription status.\n\n241\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.038\nThe other thing that I would mention,\ntoo, is the user account control.\n\n242\n00:14:20.038 --> 00:14:23.332\nThe other thing, just like any\ninstallation of software, you might see\n\n243\n00:14:23.332 --> 00:14:26.788\nthat the screen's gonna lock up,\nit darkens up and puts that little UAC, or\n\n244\n00:14:26.788 --> 00:14:30.028\nuser account control dialogue box,\nnow if you're an administrator,\n\n245\n00:14:30.028 --> 00:14:32.469\nas administrators we don't worry about it,\nright?\n\n246\n00:14:32.469 --> 00:14:35.954\nWe just click continue to complete\nthe task, but if it's an end user that's\n\n247\n00:14:35.954 --> 00:14:39.438\ntrying to install this for the first time,\nit's gonna give them a prompt for\n\n248\n00:14:39.438 --> 00:14:42.054\nadministrative credentials and\nif they don't have it,\n\n249\n00:14:42.054 --> 00:14:45.779\nthat's where your remote desktop's gonna\ncome in handy, or even Sneakernet.\n\n250\n00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:49.109\nSo keep in mind that standard users\ncan install applications as well, so\n\n251\n00:14:49.109 --> 00:14:50.760\nyou could run into problems there.\n\n252\n00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.748\nSo, Mike, if you know where to look, it's\nnot to difficult in order to troubleshoot\n\n253\n00:14:55.748 --> 00:15:00.391\nthese, it just comes down to things\nlike your license, Internet connection,\n\n254\n00:15:00.391 --> 00:15:04.377\nand making sure that your subscription\nstatus is still available.\n\n255\n00:15:04.377 --> 00:15:07.431\n>> Very good, all right, Wes,\na lot of great information there again.\n\n256\n00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:11.993\nSome more key troubleshooting tips\nwhen it comes to installing Office.\n\n257\n00:15:11.993 --> 00:15:14.431\nNow, are we gonna dive into\nour mobile devices yet, or\n\n258\n00:15:14.431 --> 00:15:15.708\ndo you want to save that one?\n\n259\n00:15:15.708 --> 00:15:18.860\n>> No, I think this is a really\ngood spot to just go ahead and\n\n260\n00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.415\ndive into mobile devices.\n\n261\n00:15:20.415 --> 00:15:24.377\nOne of the things,\nanother thing that they call out,\n\n262\n00:15:24.377 --> 00:15:27.635\nI should say,\non the MTA exam is difficult or\n\n263\n00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:33.027\ntroubleshooting connections to\nmobile devices and mobile platforms.\n\n264\n00:15:33.027 --> 00:15:37.558\nOne of the first things that you have to\nconsider is the operating system that's\n\n265\n00:15:37.558 --> 00:15:42.090\nrunning on these mobile devices because\nwhen it comes to the operating system,\n\n266\n00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.675\nthat's gonna be contingent on why\nit might not be installing or\n\n267\n00:15:45.675 --> 00:15:47.181\nallowing you to connect.\n\n268\n00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:50.486\nFirst thing to know is Android,\nwhen it comes to Android,\n\n269\n00:15:50.486 --> 00:15:52.784\nyou have to have KitKat 4.4 or later.\n\n270\n00:15:52.784 --> 00:15:56.514\nIf you have anything earlier than that,\nthen you're not going to be able to use\n\n271\n00:15:56.514 --> 00:16:00.185\nthe Office 365, and you might get an end\nuser that calls and says I'm doing\n\n272\n00:16:00.185 --> 00:16:04.116\nthe steps that you're telling me to do,\nbut the problem is it's not connecting.\n\n273\n00:16:04.116 --> 00:16:07.823\nRemember it is version specific,\nand when I say KitKat,\n\n274\n00:16:07.823 --> 00:16:11.543\nlet me be even more specific,\nAndroid-based devices.\n\n275\n00:16:11.543 --> 00:16:13.680\nWindows devices 8.1.\n\n276\n00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.950\nWindows 8, 8.1, and then the RT versions\nand up, you shouldn't have an issue.\n\n277\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.280\nAnd then we also have to worry about\nthings like iOS devices, right.\n\n278\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.090\nWe got our iPhones.\n\n279\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.330\nWe got our iPads.\n\n280\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.530\nAnd that's one of like I\nsaid in a previous episode,\n\n281\n00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.890\nwhy did they change the name from\nWindows Intune to Microsoft Intune?\n\n282\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.670\nWell it's kind of a misnomer right?\n\n283\n00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.350\nWe think of Intune, we say Windows Intune,\nwell it's got to be\n\n284\n00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.460\njust maintaining Windows devices, and\nthat's the furthest from the truth today.\n\n285\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.390\nIt really does a lot of devices, so that's\nwhy it's called Microsoft Intune today.\n\n286\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:47.740\nFor your iOS devices Your older iPads and\niPhones,\n\n287\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:53.950\nyou need to be running your iOS 8.0 or\nlater, or higher as they say.\n\n288\n00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:57.650\niPad Pro, it takes iOS 9.0 or higher.\n\n289\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.400\nSo keep that in mind, again,\nwith your mobile devices.\n\n290\n00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.940\nThe other thing to understand,\ntoo, is your Android devices,\n\n291\n00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.160\nyour iOS devices, they have to trust,\nfor instance, Windows Intune.\n\n292\n00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.755\nThere I go again, making the bad mistake.\n\n293\n00:17:10.755 --> 00:17:12.810\n[LAUGH] Microsoft Intune,\njust made all of that and\n\n294\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.320\njust called it something different.\n\n295\n00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:20.790\nMicrosoft Intune uses a certificate to\ninstall itself, its clients, on the mobile\n\n296\n00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.310\ndevices, and there's a couple things you\nhave to verify and make sure Make sure\n\n297\n00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.430\nthat the device trusts the certificate\nthat Intune is presenting to it.\n\n298\n00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.020\nIf it's not trusted, then it's not\ngonna let you install the applications,\n\n299\n00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.510\nand that's just with any software\nyou don't want that to happen,\n\n300\n00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:35.950\nyou want to make sure\nthere's a valid certificate,\n\n301\n00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.280\nbecause you want to make sure\nthat you don't get hacked.\n\n302\n00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.550\nSo make sure that the certificate\nis trusted by the device\n\n303\n00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.700\nthat you're gonna install.\n\n304\n00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.470\nThe other thing that we need to worry\nabout is you need to make sure that you\n\n305\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.640\ncan set the mobile device as an mdm,\nthe mobile device management authority.\n\n306\n00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.760\nAnd that allows the Microsoft Intune\nplatform to manage the device.\n\n307\n00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.170\nAnd then just verifying the connection\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n308\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.215\nVerify, just like anything.\n\n309\n00:18:01.215 --> 00:18:05.775\nAny other troubleshooting methodology that\nyou're gonna use, verify that you do have\n\n310\n00:18:05.775 --> 00:18:10.285\nconnection, make sure that you're\nconnected to the wireless network and\n\n311\n00:18:10.285 --> 00:18:11.135\nyou're not being blocked.\n\n312\n00:18:11.135 --> 00:18:13.875\nBut use those basic troubleshooting\nsteps there, and for\n\n313\n00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:15.565\nthe mobile devices you should be good.\n\n314\n00:18:15.565 --> 00:18:16.735\n>> Very good.\nAll right Wes,\n\n315\n00:18:16.735 --> 00:18:19.655\nnow let's say we've got this installed and\nit's been working,\n\n316\n00:18:19.655 --> 00:18:21.645\nbut all of the sudden it stops working.\n\n317\n00:18:21.645 --> 00:18:26.100\nI know sometimes applications,\nmaybe some important files get deleted or\n\n318\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.890\nsomething happens in the background.\n\n319\n00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.560\nAll of a sudden,\nthat application won't launch anymore.\n\n320\n00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.980\nAnything we can do about that?\n\n321\n00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.860\n>> Yeah, there is, and the other\none to add to that, too, I think,\n\n322\n00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.775\nI think you said viruses, didn't you.\n\n323\n00:18:37.775 --> 00:18:38.710\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Malware.\n\n324\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.610\nMalware's another one that\nmight cause those problems.\n\n325\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.000\nThose files that we need,\nwe're not messing with them,\n\n326\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.050\nbut something else takes them out, yeah.\n\n327\n00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.590\nA few things that you can do, sometimes\nyou might get things like system hangs, or\n\n328\n00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.010\nyou might get application hangs.\n\n329\n00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:54.020\nOne of the things that Microsoft\nrecommends out there on their website\n\n330\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.430\nis the legendary reboot.\n\n331\n00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.960\nReboots, and I do mean for\nthings like application hangs.\n\n332\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.440\nFor instance, if there's a profile\nthat's giving you a problem,\n\n333\n00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.290\njust restart the application.\n\n334\n00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.010\nShut it down, restart it.\n\n335\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:13.040\nIf you need to restart the device,\nor restart the computer that's on.\n\n336\n00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.480\nA lot of times that'll fix the problem.\n\n337\n00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.900\nAnd like I said, if you go out to\nMicrosoft their support documentation for\n\n338\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.760\noffice 365.\n\n339\n00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.380\nThey say start there and some of the other\nconcepts that we teach we say try\n\n340\n00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.840\nthe least invasive method first.\n\n341\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.370\nBecause a lot of times, the least\ninvasive method will work, right?\n\n342\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:33.100\nWhat do we talk?\n\n343\n00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.670\nWe talk about rebooting, right?\n\n344\n00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.720\nBefore you do a repair, right?\n\n345\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.210\nYou do a restore, you do a repair, and\n\n346\n00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.950\nthen maybe even do an uninstall and\nreinstall.\n\n347\n00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:48.950\nSo there's a few steps\nthat you could take.\n\n348\n00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.320\nStart simple.\n\n349\n00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.400\nJust restart the application.\n\n350\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.290\nIf that doesn't fix your problem,\nthen you might have to repair\n\n351\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.800\nyour office installation, and\nthere's very easy way to do that.\n\n352\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.850\nRemember earlier,\nwe were looking at the product key, and\n\n353\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.820\nI told you that there's\na repair radio button there.\n\n354\n00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.650\nLet's go ahead and go back to that\nreal quick and show you that.\n\n355\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.030\nSo if I go back into, and again,\nI know I'm doing this kind of fast,\n\n356\n00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.470\nlet me slow down here a little bit.\n\n357\n00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.980\nSo right click on the Start icon or\nthe Windows icon and choose Programs and\n\n358\n00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.440\nFeatures.\n\n359\n00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.350\nAll right.\n\n360\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.420\nAnd then there is this change option.\n\n361\n00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.290\nNotice that I'm selecting\nOffice Professional Plus 2013.\n\n362\n00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.550\nAnd I'm going back to that Change button.\n\n363\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.830\nAnd give it a second there and\n\n364\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.770\nthen what it's gonna do is we can\nperform what's known as a repair.\n\n365\n00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.570\nThis is the second.\n\n366\n00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:42.060\nFirst, least invasive, just reboot\nthe application, see if that fixes it.\n\n367\n00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.840\nSecond thing you're gonna do is\nyou're gonna try to do a repair.\n\n368\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.280\nIf you do a repair,\nyou can choose continue and\n\n369\n00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.210\nit's going to configure the operate,\nnot the operating system.\n\n370\n00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.890\nIt's gonna query the operating system,\nit's gonna query the registry,\n\n371\n00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.770\nfind out what the current settings are.\n\n372\n00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:00.270\nAnd then it's going to apply it to\nwhatever Microsoft's support database is,\n\n373\n00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:04.190\nso they can compare what they see\nhere with what they have on hand,\n\n374\n00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.440\nand then they'll go through the process\nof trying to repair the Office suite.\n\n375\n00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.910\nSo a good automated process to do this.\n\n376\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.320\nMike, I would say this could\ntake a little bit here.\n\n377\n00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.060\nThe last one I would say is that if this\ndoesn't work you can go with this is\n\n378\n00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.835\na little bit more invasive is\nuninstalling the software.\n\n379\n00:21:21.835 --> 00:21:23.560\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then reinstalling it.\n\n380\n00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:29.000\nNow be careful with that one guys\nbecause if you have any unsaved data.\n\n381\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.690\nYou could lose data, so just make sure\nthat you've run your backups, right?\n\n382\n00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.070\nBackups are important.\n\n383\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.280\nA lot of times your admins, are gonna\nset up things like folder redirection.\n\n384\n00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.680\nSo you're not using the local\nmachine to store your data.\n\n385\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.580\nBut if you are,\nmake sure you're running a backup,\n\n386\n00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.210\ncuz that is probably\nthe most invasive method.\n\n387\n00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:50.830\nAnd it is one that you run the risk of\npotentially permanently losing your data,\n\n388\n00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.380\nand you certainly don't want to do\nthat cuz that's a productivity sweep.\n\n389\n00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.580\nIf you lose your data you're\nnot too productivity.\n\n390\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.370\n>> I would think it's the opposite\nof productivity, right?\n\n391\n00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.396\n>> Yeah. Yeah.\n[LAUGH] you're not too productive there.\n\n392\n00:22:02.396 --> 00:22:03.844\n>> The opposite of productivity there.\n\n393\n00:22:03.844 --> 00:22:04.430\n>> That's right.\n\n394\n00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.610\nThat's right.\nSo like I said,\n\n395\n00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.150\ntry the least invasive method.\n\n396\n00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.870\nIf the restart doesn't work that's\nwhen you're probably gonna want to try\n\n397\n00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.020\nthe repair.\n\n398\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.140\nIf the repair doesn't work, then it very\nwell could just be user settings that\n\n399\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.490\nyou need to work with an administrator.\n\n400\n00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.880\nAnd it could be more on the user end\nthan it is really on the Office.\n\n401\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.450\nAnd or even Windows for that matter.\n\n402\n00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.020\nOr Mac if you're running Mac.\n\n403\n00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.027\n>> Now we talked a little bit about some\nof the requirements as far as our OS's go\n\n404\n00:22:29.027 --> 00:22:30.780\nwe have on our mobile devices.\n\n405\n00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.400\nI think KitKat 4.4 if I remember right.\n\n406\n00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.150\n>> Yep, 4.4.\n>> On your Android devices, on your iPads,\n\n407\n00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:41.710\niPhones, iOS 8,\non the new iPad pro, iOS 9.\n\n408\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.990\nWhat about on my Windows operating system?\n\n409\n00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.645\nAny requirements,\nthere if I wanna install it locally?\n\n410\n00:22:45.645 --> 00:22:46.335\n>> That's right.\n\n411\n00:22:46.335 --> 00:22:53.910\nIf you wanna run Office 365,\nmake it easier for yourselves on the exam.\n\n412\n00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:58.330\nOne of the things, when I'm instructing\nsomebody or was instructing somebody in\n\n413\n00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.710\na company that I was worked for, I would\ntry to teach them ways that you could\n\n414\n00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:08.870\nremember a whole bulk of information,\nand you only had to remember one thing.\n\n415\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.900\nWindows service pack one and up.\n\n416\n00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.070\nYou don't have to go into the exam\nbooth saying, hey, do I have to have,\n\n417\n00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.060\nwhat was it?\n\n418\n00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:22.090\nIt was Windows 7, Service Pack One,\nit was Windows 8, 8.1, Windows 10.\n\n419\n00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.770\nJust remember the first one.\n\n420\n00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:30.470\nIf you remember the first one, go ahead\nand you just remember that first one and\n\n421\n00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.690\neverything else after that\nwill fit into place for you.\n\n422\n00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:36.380\nIt's also supported on Mac as well so\nkeep that in mind,\n\n423\n00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:40.380\nthey do have Mac installations that\nyou can use for the operating system.\n\n424\n00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.820\nSo yeah, fairly straightforward and\n\n425\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.050\nnot too difficult there, you can also find\nthat out there at Office 365 as well, too.\n\n426\n00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.440\n>> All right Wes,\na lot of great information there.\n\n427\n00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.100\nWe looked at troubleshooting all the way\nfrom basic network connectivity,\n\n428\n00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.580\nif I can get that out.\n\n429\n00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.640\nUp to the applications itself and\nconnecting those and\n\n430\n00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.440\neven installing on locally\non our hardware or\n\n431\n00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.850\nour mobile devices, anything else\nyou wanna throw in for our users?\n\n432\n00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.790\n>> Yeah one last thing that's very\nimportant because we're talking\n\n433\n00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.470\nabout software as a service, we gotta talk\njust briefly about the mechanism that we\n\n434\n00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.900\nused to connect to that platform,\nand that's your browser.\n\n435\n00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:19.060\nThis is kind of easy to remember as well,\nit works on Internet Explorer,\n\n436\n00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.790\nand specifically they want you\ngo to Internet Explorer 11,\n\n437\n00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.770\nso if you guys in your company out\nthere are have taken a little bit of\n\n438\n00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.670\ntime moving into the later editions or\nthe newer editions of Internet Explorer,\n\n439\n00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:35.710\nnow's the time because they've pulled\nsupport for, what was it, Windows 8 or-\n\n440\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.460\n>> Seven.\n\n441\n00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.070\n>> excuse me, Internet Explorer 7,\n8, 9, and even 10.\n\n442\n00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:44.410\nAnd they'll tell you on the website,\ntoo, that even if you're still\n\n443\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.580\nusing those browsers, you have a very,\nvery diminished experience.\n\n444\n00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.590\nIn fact, Yammer, they'll tell you,\nit doesn't say unstable,\n\n445\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.910\nit says completely unusable.\n\n446\n00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.390\nSo you're gonna wanna\nuse the latest browser\n\n447\n00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.660\nthat Internet Explorer has out there.\n\n448\n00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.080\nIt's supported in Chrome, and\nit's supported in Firefox,\n\n449\n00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.800\nas well as Safari too.\n\n450\n00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.910\nThe big ones there is just making\nsure that you're not using some\n\n451\n00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.680\nof the older editions\nof Internet Explorer.\n\n452\n00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.130\nWhen it comes down to it,\nfor security purposes,\n\n453\n00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:13.970\nwe can definitely get off onto a whole\ncomplete different subject alone on that.\n\n454\n00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.820\nMove to the newer Internet Explorer.\n\n455\n00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.290\nAgain, keep in mind that Edge is\nthere Chrome, Firefox, and Safari,\n\n456\n00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.450\nso again, another straightforward process,\njust know which ones you're using.\n\n457\n00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.300\n>> All right, Wes, again,\nthanks for all that information.\n\n458\n00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.580\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n459\n00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.040\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n460\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:31.790\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n461\n00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.215\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n462\n00:25:34.215 --> 00:25:38.510\n[NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:17.280\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.610\nToday we're doing our\nMTA cloud fundamentals.\n\n5\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.920\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be getting into something that we,\n\n6\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.440\n[LAUGH] is always fun to deal with,\nand supporting Exchange Online.\n\n7\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.450\nRight, we know that email in a corporate\nenvironment is a very important process,\n\n8\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.340\na very important part of our day to\nday activities for my end users.\n\n9\n00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.660\nSo making sure that they can connect,\nstay connected, and\n\n10\n00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.090\ntake advantage of those services,\nextremely important.\n\n11\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.410\nSo here to help us with all that is Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.030\nHow's it going, Wes?\n\n13\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.010\n>> It's going great, Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.810\nAnd thanks.\nAs always, it's good to be back here.\n\n15\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.325\nAnd that's right, we're going to be\nlooking at some of the things that you\n\n16\n00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.295\ncan do to help troubleshoot your\nExchange Online connections.\n\n17\n00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:59.355\nNow, one of the things that\nwe've been really discussing\n\n18\n00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:02.305\nas we've gone through this series,\nwe've been discussing cloud computing, but\n\n19\n00:01:02.305 --> 00:01:05.755\nwe really been focused, if you think\nabout it, on software as a service.\n\n20\n00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:09.340\nSo, this is just another one of those\nservices that doesn't require us to\n\n21\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.280\nhave an on-premise Exchange Server,\nand that's great for\n\n22\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.820\nsmall businesses that maybe don't have\nthe capital to afford a dedicated\n\n23\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.680\nteam to manage their Exchange on-site.\n\n24\n00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.760\nSo one of the things that we need\nto look at, is how can we keep our\n\n25\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.470\nusers connected, and if there are problems\nwhat are some of the things that might be\n\n26\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.500\ncausing the problems, and then some of the\nthings we can do to look at the symptoms.\n\n27\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.315\nSo one of the first things that we wanna\ndo, and they call this out on the exam,\n\n28\n00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:41.842\nas well as on Office 365 Support Center.\n\n29\n00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:46.021\nAnd, in fact, Mike we talk about this a\nlot in not just supporting something like\n\n30\n00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:50.138\na cloud base solution but really when it\ncomes support of the operating system in\n\n31\n00:01:50.138 --> 00:01:54.193\ngeneral, one of the first things that\nthey say take a look at is whether you're\n\n32\n00:01:54.193 --> 00:01:55.864\nrunning your Windows updates.\n\n33\n00:01:55.864 --> 00:02:00.276\n>> I was gonna say reboot but-\n>> Reboot, yeah, and that would be what,\n\n34\n00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:01.451\nthe four R's.\n\n35\n00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:02.101\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n36\n00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.659\n>> You reboot, you repair, restore, and\n\n37\n00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.815\nreinstall.\n\n38\n00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:07.323\n>> There you go.\n\n39\n00:02:07.323 --> 00:02:08.969\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, so- [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:09.518\n>> And well,\n\n41\n00:02:09.518 --> 00:02:12.084\nwe're gonna be looking at\nsome of that coming up.\n\n42\n00:02:12.084 --> 00:02:15.060\nThe first thing that we wanna look\nat though are Windows updates.\n\n43\n00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.450\nAnd I really kind of wanna, if you\nhaven't been familiar with Windows 10,\n\n44\n00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.440\nmaybe you've seen Windows 7, or\nmaybe you're not familiar with either,\n\n45\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.042\nand it's good that you're here with us.\n\n46\n00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:30.960\nI wanna show you how to do Windows updates\ninside of Windows 7, as well as in Windows\n\n47\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.940\n10, because Windows 7 updates,\nWindows 8, Windows 8.1 updates.\n\n48\n00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.050\nThey've all been really\nfrom the same location.\n\n49\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.280\nBut in Windows 10,\nthings change a little bit.\n\n50\n00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.630\nWindows 10 has gone to a completely\nnew type of update model,\n\n51\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.260\nand we definitely want to look at that.\n\n52\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.540\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in here.\n\n53\n00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.940\nI've got a Windows 7 machine here,\nand we're gonna go ahead and\n\n54\n00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.590\nwe're going to look at how you can\nmaintain your updates inside of Windows 7,\n\n55\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.620\nbecause it could be something\nthat might be causing you not,\n\n56\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.530\nthe lack of connection to your Exchange\nOnline, if you have an outdated system.\n\n57\n00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.320\nSo one of the first things that we can do,\nhere, is go to our Start button.\n\n58\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.450\nAnd we can go to Control Panel, and one of\nthe great things is the Control Panel, for\n\n59\n00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.918\nthe most part, hasn't changed too\nmuch since the days of Vista.\n\n60\n00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:18.220\nSome names change a little bit, but\n\n61\n00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.750\nit really, this category view has\nreally just maintained itself.\n\n62\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.389\nIt hasn't really changed too much, so\nwe're gonna be under System and Security\n\n63\n00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.919\nhere in Windows 7, and the one that I'm\nlooking for right here in the middle of\n\n64\n00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.686\nthe list is gonna be Windows Update, and\nthat's really gonna be important for us.\n\n65\n00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:35.979\nNow, you're gonna notice\nsomething here that,\n\n66\n00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.990\nwell doesn't seem that I'm checking for\nany updates right now.\n\n67\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.987\n>> Shame, shame.\n\n68\n00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:40.981\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n69\n00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:44.065\nSo, certainly not following\nmy advice right here, but\n\n70\n00:03:44.065 --> 00:03:48.263\nI went ahead on this machine, I didn't\nwanna have the updates prepared, so\n\n71\n00:03:48.263 --> 00:03:50.380\nthat you could see what it looks like.\n\n72\n00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.938\nAnd that's my story,\nand I'm sticking to it.\n\n73\n00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:53.971\n>> [LAUGH] We'll take your word for it.\n\n74\n00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:55.413\n>> All right, very good.\n\n75\n00:03:55.413 --> 00:03:57.093\nAnd so we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n76\n00:03:57.093 --> 00:03:59.860\nwhat we wanna do is we wanna\nchange the settings first.\n\n77\n00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.930\nAs you can see it says check for\nupdates for your computer.\n\n78\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.505\nI'm gonna go in here,\nI'm gonna change the settings.\n\n79\n00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:10.951\nNow if you're in a domain environment,\nplease understand that most likely this is\n\n80\n00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:15.159\ngonna be managed by, it's some kind of\nformalized patch management system.\n\n81\n00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.170\nMost often your administrators\nare gonna wanna control this,\n\n82\n00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.349\nbecause as you go through patch\nmanagement, in a small business,\n\n83\n00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.300\nwe really a lot of times you can just do\nupdates, you don't have to worry about it.\n\n84\n00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.380\nBut in a larger environment where it's\nheavily managed, we don't just deploy\n\n85\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.420\nupdates to systems, and potentially\nbring down the production network.\n\n86\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.950\nSo one of the things I do wanna mention\nis if you see a little information bar\n\n87\n00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.880\nacross the top that says some settings\nare managed by your administrator and\n\n88\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.470\nthen these are grayed out, typically,\nwhat that means is you've got\n\n89\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.330\na domain computer, it's attached\nto an active directory domain,\n\n90\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.130\nand they're managing it\nthrough Group Policy,\n\n91\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.940\nwhich I have to say is much more\nefficient than what I'm showing you here.\n\n92\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.339\nBut if you are in a small environment\nwhere you only have 5 or 6 license,\n\n93\n00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:00.360\n10 license, maybe you're not gonna\nbe scaling up to the 300 users and\n\n94\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.500\nthen beyond, which Office 365 can support,\nthen you might be doing it the traditional\n\n95\n00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.870\nSneakernet, decentralized model,\nbut in a large environment,\n\n96\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.970\nI can tell you this won't be\nthe way that you wanna do this.\n\n97\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.960\nAll right, so,\ncouple different ways that we can do this.\n\n98\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.860\nWe can do the recommended install updates\nautomatically, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n99\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.270\nleave it at that, because that really is\nthe way you should be installing updates,\n\n100\n00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.230\nwhether we're talking\nabout Exchange Online,\n\n101\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.650\nwhether we're talking about Office 365.\n\n102\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.950\nReally, just for\nWindows security in general,\n\n103\n00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.760\nmake sure that you have the latest\nsecurity patches, bug fixes, if you will.\n\n104\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.340\nAll right, we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose okay to this.\n\n105\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.920\nAnd in the background it's gonna\ngo ahead and check for my updates.\n\n106\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.250\nNow I also have the ability that if I want\nto, and I wanna verify that I do have some\n\n107\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.170\nupdates that have been installed, I can\nalways go to View Update History, and\n\n108\n00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.600\nyou can see that we do have\nsome updates installed.\n\n109\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.420\nSo if there's ever an update,\nif you're troubleshooting,\n\n110\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.890\nyou go out to the Office,\nSupport.Office365.com.\n\n111\n00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.040\nAnd they say well, look for\nsuch and such update.\n\n112\n00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.222\nWell you can find that information\nright here and it is important to have.\n\n113\n00:06:05.222 --> 00:06:08.844\nJust to ensure that if they\ncall out a specific update,\n\n114\n00:06:08.844 --> 00:06:12.963\nthat you can find it here in\nthe list to verify that it is there.\n\n115\n00:06:12.963 --> 00:06:15.722\n>> Very good.\nYeah I've always found that computers can\n\n116\n00:06:15.722 --> 00:06:18.845\nget a little quirky when\nthey've got updates pending,\n\n117\n00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.850\nwhen there's updates available.\n\n118\n00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.560\nWeird things happen.\n\n119\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.370\nYou hate to say that.\n\n120\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.720\nThat's the technical term, right?\n\n121\n00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.584\nWeird things happen.\n\n122\n00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:29.139\nBut honestly, Windows systems can get\na little quirky when they've got updates\n\n123\n00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.909\npending, and you really need\nwhen you're trouble shooting,\n\n124\n00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:34.835\nshould be one of the first things\nyou do is let's see if there are any\n\n125\n00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:37.830\nupdates available, or\nany updates waiting to be being installed.\n\n126\n00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.470\nLet me go ahead and get those done,\nthey might fix the problem.\n\n127\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.300\nThey might fix the erratic\nbehavior that you're experiencing,\n\n128\n00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.910\nthe connectivity issues.\n\n129\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.020\nIt could be something's changed on\nthe remote end out there in the cloud,\n\n130\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.460\nand without this update your computer\nis now unable to connect any more.\n\n131\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.020\nOnce you get that update done,\nit fixes everything and\n\n132\n00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.350\nall of a sudden you can connect again, so\nit really does need to be that first step.\n\n133\n00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.430\n>> It certainly does, and\nthen from a security standpoint,\n\n134\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.390\ntoo, a lot of times when these hot\nfixes come out, these updates,\n\n135\n00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.500\nthey can fix things like\nremote code exploitations,\n\n136\n00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.120\na lot of times people getting in and\nbeing able to take over your computer,\n\n137\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.090\nso I would definitely have them up to\ndate, regardless if you're talking about\n\n138\n00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.100\ncloud fundamentals,\njust in a Windows environment.\n\n139\n00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.790\nWe say that for\nall of our connectivity devices too.\n\n140\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.740\nKeep patches and firmware up-to-date.\n\n141\n00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.210\nNow it has changed inside of\nthe Windows 10 operating system.\n\n142\n00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.660\nWhat you just seen for Windows 7,\nWindows 8, 8.1's really gonna be the same.\n\n143\n00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.780\nBut in Windows 10,\nthey changed the update model.\n\n144\n00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.150\nThey've gone to a different\ntype of model here.\n\n145\n00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.960\nAnd, let's go ahead and check that out.\n\n146\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.180\nI've actually switched over to\nmy Windows 10 machine here, and\n\n147\n00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.110\nI'm gonna go to the same\nlocation that we were before.\n\n148\n00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.860\nI'm gonna right-click this time,\nthough, on the Windows tile here.\n\n149\n00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.313\nAnd I'm gonna choose Control Panel.\n\n150\n00:07:51.313 --> 00:07:54.847\nAnd then notice Mike,\nit really has changed too much, right,\n\n151\n00:07:54.847 --> 00:07:58.996\nyou can see the Control Panel,\nthe category view, it all looks the same.\n\n152\n00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:01.954\nBut, if I go to system and\nsecurity this time, you're going to see,\n\n153\n00:08:01.954 --> 00:08:04.540\nwell, I guess it will be\nthe lack of what you see here.\n\n154\n00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.530\nThere's something missing\ntoday in Windows 10,\n\n155\n00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.650\nthat was inside of your Windows 7 machine.\n\n156\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.500\nSo, let's just look here real quick,\nand then let's just switch\n\n157\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.440\nback over to our Windows 7 machine and\nlook at that control panel again.\n\n158\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.410\nAnd Mike,\nI'm gonna challenge you here sir.\n\n159\n00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.810\nWhat do you see that is missing?\n\n160\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.130\nSo here's our Windows 7 list and\nI'll give you a hint.\n\n161\n00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.336\nIt's within the first five.\n\n162\n00:08:25.336 --> 00:08:28.723\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> And\n\n163\n00:08:28.723 --> 00:08:31.087\nnotice here's our Windows 10 machine.\n\n164\n00:08:31.087 --> 00:08:33.067\n[CROSSTALK] Windows updates.\n\n165\n00:08:33.067 --> 00:08:35.800\n>> Windows updates is not in the list.\n\n166\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.510\n>> And we just got through saying how\nimportant it was to do Windows updates,\n\n167\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.650\nand now they've taken it away from me.\n\n168\n00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.350\nWhere'd it go, Wes?\n\n169\n00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.760\n>> That's right we got some\nconsolation prizes for Mike.\n\n170\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.994\nHe can get them on the way\nout the door there.\n\n171\n00:08:45.994 --> 00:08:47.800\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n172\n00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.970\nWindows or I should say Microsoft is no\nlonger giving you the option of whether\n\n173\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:52.805\nyou're gonna update.\n\n174\n00:08:52.805 --> 00:08:55.910\nAbout the only thing that you can do\ntoday is defer the updates a little bit,\n\n175\n00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.580\nbut, they're going to happen.\n\n176\n00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.530\nAgain, this is something\nnewer in Windows 10.\n\n177\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.870\nSo, if you are used to doing your\nWindows updates, scheduling them,\n\n178\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.400\nsetting them in place, well today,\nit's really going to be done for you.\n\n179\n00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.080\nAnd let me show you that.\n\n180\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.190\nNow.\nA couple of different ways you can get\n\n181\n00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.250\nhere, one on the ways that I get here\nis through the new settings menu, and\n\n182\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.070\nmy head's actually kind of\ncovering it up right now.\n\n183\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.270\nIf I go to the action center.\n\n184\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.630\nA little icon down here and\nI can launch this.\n\n185\n00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.680\nThe action center is a very good location.\n\n186\n00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.670\nNow, action center's been inside of\nWindows 7, it's been inside of Windows 8\n\n187\n00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.970\nand 8.1, but they changed it up a little\nbit and I really like this interface, and\n\n188\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.250\nI'm gonna go down to this little tile that\nyou see here that says all settings and\n\n189\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.470\nwe're gonna go ahead and click on that.\n\n190\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.640\nAnd when we choose that it\nbrings up the new menu.\n\n191\n00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.490\nAll right.\n\n192\n00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.910\nThis new menu is completely redefined.\n\n193\n00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.520\nIt's got a new look and what I'm looking\nfor specifically here is the update and\n\n194\n00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.160\nsecurity.\n\n195\n00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.100\nWe'll go ahead and choose that.\n\n196\n00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.790\nAnd notice that I have\nWindows Updates here and it says,\n\n197\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:02.395\nyour device is up to date, so\nI can say I'm on top of on this one right?\n\n198\n00:10:02.395 --> 00:10:04.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And thank you.\n\n199\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.660\nThank you.\nAnd\n\n200\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.150\nnow I wanna look at the advanced options,\n\n201\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.560\nit'd be very easy to just go ahead and\nsay hey, check for updates.\n\n202\n00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.244\nBut I really want you to kinda\nsee what's going on here.\n\n203\n00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:13.970\nSo task links, this is no different.\n\n204\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.460\nTask links all over the place,\n\n205\n00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.630\nand these task links are,\nhonestly I really like them.\n\n206\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:24.300\nAll right, so now it's gonna ask us\nchoose how updates are installed,\n\n207\n00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.960\nautomatic, recommended,\nnotify to schedule restart.\n\n208\n00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.950\nNotice you don't have any\nother options than that.\n\n209\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:32.706\n>> Where's my do not update?\n\n210\n00:10:32.706 --> 00:10:33.860\n[LAUGH]\n>> Do not update, never install,\n\n211\n00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.700\nwell that's gone.\n\n212\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.486\nAnd again, it's a new model here.\n\n213\n00:10:36.486 --> 00:10:38.200\nYou could defer the updates but\n\n214\n00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.070\nwhat this is gonna do is\nexactly what it sounds like.\n\n215\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.020\nIt's gonna say okay we're\ngonna update in two days.\n\n216\n00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.830\nThere is a pending restart so\nit gives you the time to you know save,\n\n217\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.920\ncontrol S is your friend, right?\n\n218\n00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.100\nGives you the time to save your work.\n\n219\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.430\nBut one of the things you\nwanna keep in mind is,\n\n220\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.245\nyou will not be able to stop the updates.\n\n221\n00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:57.590\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n222\n00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.090\nSo, next thing we wanna see here is,\nchoose how updates are delivered.\n\n223\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.730\nAnd notice that they can be updated from\nmore than one place, which is kinda cool.\n\n224\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.170\nPCs on my local network.\n\n225\n00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.540\nThis is something that's kind of new.\n\n226\n00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:16.890\nIf you're familiar with WSUS,\nor not WSUS, the BranchCache.\n\n227\n00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.810\n>> Yes.\n>> I'm trying\n\n228\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.425\nto think of the technology, right?\n\n229\n00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:21.745\nBranchCache has something known as,\nnot hosted mode,\n\n230\n00:11:21.745 --> 00:11:25.915\nDistributed Cache Mode where your local\nclients keep copies of your data.\n\n231\n00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:27.835\nAnd rather than going\nout to your main office,\n\n232\n00:11:27.835 --> 00:11:32.810\nyou can check on your local network if\nthese computers have a copy of that data.\n\n233\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.390\nSo it saves your bandwidth, right.\n\n234\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.850\nIt saves any latency over WAN lengths,.\n\n235\n00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.100\nWell, they've kind of taken that concepts,\nnot the technology, but they taken\n\n236\n00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.730\nthe concept and applied that to updates\nnow, which I think is kind of cool.\n\n237\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.670\nRather than go all the way out to\nthe Windows update servers and\n\n238\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.780\nhold down any updates across\nmaybe a slow WAN lane.\n\n239\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.990\nNow I can look and say okay,\ndoes PC A have it?\n\n240\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:12:00.340\nWell if PC A doesn't have it, does PC B,\nor PC 01, Client 01, Client 02,\n\n241\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.320\nwhatever machines I have on my network,\ndo they have that update available?\n\n242\n00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.380\nAnd if they do,\nI can connect right to them,\n\n243\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.530\nalmost like that distributive cash mode,\nand I can download it locally.\n\n244\n00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.229\nSo good thing to have there.\n\n245\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.070\nBut really it's not really\na show on Windows updates.\n\n246\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:19.380\nBut it is one of the things that could\nrun into some problems when it comes to\n\n247\n00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.970\nconnecting to exchange online.\n\n248\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.280\nSo know where those settings are,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n249\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.880\nleave it to the automatic.\n\n250\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.710\nIf I wanted to, I could check for updates.\n\n251\n00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.680\nIt tells me I'm up to date,\nbut well, that changes.\n\n252\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.390\nRemember, second Tuesday of every month.\n\n253\n00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:37.040\nIt's patch Tuesday for Microsoft out\nthere so well, today is Tuesday.\n\n254\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.590\n>> Yeah, it's Tuesday.\n\n255\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.740\nIs it the second or the third?\n\n256\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.440\nIs it the second?\n\n257\n00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.070\n>> I think it might be\nthe second one here.\n\n258\n00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.250\nSo I think we might actually,\n\n259\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.360\ntoday's date, where it might actually be\nthe second Tuesday of the month here so\n\n260\n00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.220\ntomorrow I'm probably gonna\nsee a bunch of these.\n\n261\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.280\nAnyhow, make sure that your\nsystems are up to date.\n\n262\n00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.740\nIt is important.\n\n263\n00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:59.360\nNow, the other thing that you could do is\nyou could repair the profile of the user.\n\n264\n00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.070\nNow we've kind of shown you how you\ncan do that in past episodes but,\n\n265\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:09.600\nand it's really just repairing\nthe Office 365 interface.\n\n266\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.690\nAnd you can do this just by going to\nthe programs and features option.\n\n267\n00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:19.040\nFairly easy to get to here, if you right\nclick on Windows tile here in Windows 10,\n\n268\n00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.760\ngo to programs and features.\n\n269\n00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.360\nAnd then I could look through the list.\n\n270\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.070\nI can find the Office installation\nthat's in question, and\n\n271\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.500\nif I need to I could do a repair.\n\n272\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.660\nSo that you can see.\n\n273\n00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.940\nLet's kind of zoom in on there.\n\n274\n00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.780\nYou can see that I could\ndo a repair right there and\n\n275\n00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.880\nI can repair the Office installation.\n\n276\n00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.940\nAnd that's another thing that they tell\nyou that if you're trouble-shooting it,\n\n277\n00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.670\nat least from client's perspective\nwhere you can actually start,\n\n278\n00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.050\nlet me go ahead and\nclose this down here real quick.\n\n279\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:48.880\nAll right.\n\n280\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.770\nSo, couple of real easy ways Mike,\nnothing too difficult here.\n\n281\n00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.360\nMake sure that your updates are there,\n\n282\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.930\nmake sure that you know\nthat they're being applied,\n\n283\n00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:02.510\nif they're not being applied, make sure\nthat you apply them in Windows 10.\n\n284\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.660\nKeep in mind you don't get\nthe option to say don't install.\n\n285\n00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.000\nSo you really should be\ngood to go on that one.\n\n286\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.840\n>> Right.\nVery good.\n\n287\n00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.955\nAnd as we always say,\ntry to keep it simple right?\n\n288\n00:14:11.955 --> 00:14:13.330\nTry the easy stuff first.\n\n289\n00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.290\nThe stuff that's local to that machine.\n\n290\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.670\nDepending, it might be something we can\nwalk the user through, let them do it,\n\n291\n00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:24.120\nand maybe help them fix their\nsystem themselves, before we move\n\n292\n00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.860\non to a little more complex solutions,\nwhich is where we're headed next.\n\n293\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.650\n>> That's right.\n\n294\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.610\nSo there's other things, too.\n\n295\n00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.390\nRight now, we're focused on Exchange.\n\n296\n00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.980\nAnd there are plenty of utilities.\n\n297\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.290\nIn fact, we've got an episode coming up\nwhere we're gonna take all the tools and\n\n298\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.150\nbundle them into a single episode.\n\n299\n00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.920\nBut we really wanna look in this episode,\n\n300\n00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.240\non what we have to do more\nspecifically for Exchange.\n\n301\n00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.690\nSo let's go ahead and check that out.\n\n302\n00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:51.000\nNow I've got the Office 365\nAdmin center pulled up here, and\n\n303\n00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.760\nI'm default view, here's the dashboard.\n\n304\n00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.900\nBut I also have this tools dashboard and\n\n305\n00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.040\nI know that it's a little\nbit difficult to see here.\n\n306\n00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.480\nLet's see if we can zoom in on\nthat just a little bit there.\n\n307\n00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.550\nSo now I have the tools dashboard, and\n\n308\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.050\nthe tools dashboard you can well\nimagine what's there right?\n\n309\n00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:12.440\nSome tools and\nthey got a great set of built in tools.\n\n310\n00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.240\nNow I say built in tools, you're going to\nhave to install them, but at least from\n\n311\n00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:22.330\nyour admin consult,\nyou get the ability to download these.\n\n312\n00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.810\nI was gonna say one of the first ones that\nwe have that we really wanna look at,\n\n313\n00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:31.630\nthis is called the ECPA if you guys didn't\nhave enough acronyms in IT out here.\n\n314\n00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.090\nWe'll throw another one at you.\n\n315\n00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.820\nAnd that's just quite simple\nthe Exchange Client Performance Analyzer.\n\n316\n00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:37.620\nRight?\n\n317\n00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.220\nNow when you run this, it's an MSI file.\n\n318\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.810\nSo if I was to click on this,\nall right, you can see, oop.\n\n319\n00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.980\nMaybe you can see it, there we go.\n\n320\n00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.130\nYou can see that it's an MSI file and\nthat I can download it and install it, and\n\n321\n00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.840\nI've already got this done.\n\n322\n00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.506\nSo we'll take a,\nit won't take too much of our time here.\n\n323\n00:15:55.506 --> 00:15:59.028\nBecause this is a really,\nreally cool feature that I wanna show you.\n\n324\n00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:02.121\nSo let me go ahead and show you on\na machine that has already got that\n\n325\n00:16:02.121 --> 00:16:06.185\ninstalled, so we don't have to wait for\nthe download and the installation process.\n\n326\n00:16:06.185 --> 00:16:10.061\nNow once it's installed on\nyour Windows 10 machines here,\n\n327\n00:16:10.061 --> 00:16:14.604\nI'm going to all apps, and if I want\nI can use the search functionality,\n\n328\n00:16:14.604 --> 00:16:18.140\nI can just type client and\nit comes up in the list.\n\n329\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.420\nIf you're looking and searching for\nit, it's fairly easy to find here.\n\n330\n00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.100\nI believe it's Microsoft.\n\n331\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.130\nThat's the other one we'll look at.\n\n332\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.280\nThere we go office 365,\nclient performance analyzer.\n\n333\n00:16:30.652 --> 00:16:34.610\nAll right, now, we've got the ability\nto test a couple of things here, right.\n\n334\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:38.718\nWe've got the ability that we\ncan test SharePoint if you will.\n\n335\n00:16:38.718 --> 00:16:42.060\nAnd we're gonna show that in another\nepisode when we look at SharePoint.\n\n336\n00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.240\nBut we can run this\nexchange analyzer here and\n\n337\n00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.480\nit's going to run it against\nthe Mailbox that we want.\n\n338\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.200\nSo let's give you a scenario right?\n\n339\n00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.930\nMike has called me up and is an end user.\n\n340\n00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.060\nAnd said hey Wes, I've tried to\nconnect to my Exchange online.\n\n341\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.680\nI can't connect.\n\n342\n00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.280\nAnd we go through some of the other\ntechniques, or tips if you will,\n\n343\n00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.220\nwe've talked about in a previous episode,\nverifying things like connectivity,\n\n344\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.520\nmaking sure well, Mike,\nis your cable plugged in, network adapter.\n\n345\n00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.960\nLet's look at some of the simple things\nfirst and then once that's done,\n\n346\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.160\nI can distribute this MSI file,\nhave Mike install it,\n\n347\n00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.980\nhave him put his mailbox,\nhis email address in there and choose OK.\n\n348\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:26.950\nAnd then what it does is,\nit's going to run a test, all right?\n\n349\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.230\nAnd you'll see this is\nkind of interesting here,\n\n350\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:33.670\nit will take and shoot an email\nout to Mike to verify that hey,\n\n351\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:38.080\nat least Microsoft's utility\ncould connect to Outlook, right?\n\n352\n00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.820\nAnd if it connects to Outlook,\n\n353\n00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.880\nat this point I can say well Mike\nyou're probably doing what Wes does,\n\n354\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.360\nyou've learned to type for me, maybe\nyou need to retype the password, right?\n\n355\n00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.925\nVery easy to do, in fact, you guys can\nprobably seen it through this series where\n\n356\n00:17:49.925 --> 00:17:52.960\nI've got a password that I have typed and\nI have to type it three or four times,\n\n357\n00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.420\nbecause, well,\ntyping seems to be challenging to me.\n\n358\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.439\nSo that can happen to you guys as well if\n\n359\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.810\nthe email ends up showing\nin the user's inbox.\n\n360\n00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:13.370\nSo, very nice little utility to have,\nand very easy to run.\n\n361\n00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.630\nAnd we'll see some of the results here,\ncoming up.\n\n362\n00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.140\nI won't make you guys wait forever.\n\n363\n00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.660\nNow, the other thing that\nwe have access to and\n\n364\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:27.170\nwe just switch back over here\nto our Office 365 admin center.\n\n365\n00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.780\nThis is really, really cool.\n\n366\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.930\nI like this, because what this does\nis this helps me to test out things\n\n367\n00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:35.405\nlike the protocol surrounding Outlook,\nright.\n\n368\n00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:38.410\nMaybe I think it's a protocol that\nmight be causing the problem.\n\n369\n00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.980\nAnd we'll look at telnet coming up, but\n\n370\n00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.720\nwe wanna look at this built-in\nutility that we have.\n\n371\n00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.290\nNow this is kinda interesting, because\nyou're not gonna be in the tools location.\n\n372\n00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.960\nAnd this is one of\nthe reasons I mention this\n\n373\n00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.420\nis some of the tools that you\nmight use might be obvious okay?\n\n374\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.930\nI'm testing Exchange, Mike where do\nyou think I might find that tool?\n\n375\n00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.880\n>> I would say under Tools.\n\n376\n00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.750\n>> Or Exchange, right?\n\n377\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:59.300\n>> Or Exchange, yes.\n\n378\n00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.985\n>> Okay, so we're gonna be testing\nExchange through Skype for Business.\n\n379\n00:19:03.985 --> 00:19:05.790\n>> [LAUGH] That makes total sense.\n\n380\n00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:06.630\n>> That makes sense right?\n\n381\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.990\nSo, all joking aside.\n\n382\n00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.700\nFrom the admin center here I'm just\ngonna go ahead and what I'm gonna do is,\n\n383\n00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.820\nnotice that we've got Skype for business.\n\n384\n00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.430\nAll right, so we get in here to Skype for\n\n385\n00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:22.400\nBusiness's admin console,\nand we wait for it.\n\n386\n00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.410\nAnd we wait for it, and I tell you what.\n\n387\n00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.610\nLet's see how our test\nis running over here.\n\n388\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.460\nOkay, yeah, I'll tell you what,\nthat's finished.\n\n389\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.430\nLet's go ahead and look at this, and\n\n390\n00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.230\nthen we'll go back to\nthe Remote Connectivity Analyzer.\n\n391\n00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.000\nNow, notice what it did here.\n\n392\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.900\nNotice that it told me the application\ntype, right, Exchange.\n\n393\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.950\nAnd it let me know, hey, you're running\nWindows 10 Ten Enterprise, right?\n\n394\n00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:45.440\nIt even tells me how much memory is in the\noperating system because it needs to make\n\n395\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.390\nsure that you have what?\n\n396\n00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.720\nThe minimum requirements.\n\n397\n00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.890\nIf you're not getting a good experience,\ncould it be because maybe your\n\n398\n00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.590\nprocessor isn't where it needs\nto be as far as its strength.\n\n399\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.701\nMaybe your RAM isn't where it needs to be.\n\n400\n00:19:55.701 --> 00:19:59.672\nIt could be a perform,\na diminished experience is what they call\n\n401\n00:19:59.672 --> 00:20:04.810\nit up on their websites when you\nlook at their support documentation.\n\n402\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:05.840\nBut what did it do?\n\n403\n00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.760\nIt went through and\n\n404\n00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.920\nit tests the ports that Exchange uses\nto see can I make a connection right?\n\n405\n00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.090\nWe have port 80, HTTP traffic.\n\n406\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.350\nLooks like it's open, ready to go.\n\n407\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.940\nYou see 443 there, HTTPS.\n\n408\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.970\nSMTP there for SMTP relay is the 587.\n\n409\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.300\niMap there you can see and then POP3.\n\n410\n00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:31.040\nNotice that it talks about the Office\n365 service endpoint out of region.\n\n411\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.980\nDon't have to worry about that and\nsome other information.\n\n412\n00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:40.676\nSo latency, now this HTTP latency to CND,\nthere's another acronym, gotta love that.\n\n413\n00:20:40.676 --> 00:20:42.990\nContent delivery network,\na content delivery network\n\n414\n00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.990\ncan help you if you've got a large\nOffice deployment, you've got a couple\n\n415\n00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.380\nof different types of content right,\nyou got generic content like icons,\n\n416\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:59.420\nimages, information that's not so business\ncritical versus the business information.\n\n417\n00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.670\nSo, it doesn't makes sense in a very\nlarge network to waste your bandwidth or\n\n418\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:08.000\nat least your performance,\ntrying to go all the way out to Microsoft,\n\n419\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.270\ngrab some of that generic information and\nthen pull it back down to your network, so\n\n420\n00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.700\nwhat you can do is you can integrate\na third party using a content delivery\n\n421\n00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:21.290\nnetwork and they will host the generic\ndata and it's usually region specific.\n\n422\n00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.100\nSo, geographically, it'll be close,\n\n423\n00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.660\nthe CND of the content delivery network's\ngonna be closer to where your LAN is, and\n\n424\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.470\nyou'll go to them to grab the generic\ninformation with your business critical\n\n425\n00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.410\ndata, you go out to Microsoft,\nin this case, exchange and\n\n426\n00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.950\nyou pull down you business critical data\nthat's being stored in their data centers.\n\n427\n00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.010\nSo, it's letting you know\nthat the latency, here,\n\n428\n00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.995\nis not really too bad right?\n\n429\n00:21:41.995 --> 00:21:43.490\n66.3 miliseconds.\n\n430\n00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.570\nThat's not too horrible.\n\n431\n00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.580\n>> Not too bad.\n\n432\n00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.560\n>> Right?\nAnd then just some little\n\n433\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.150\nmore information.\n\n434\n00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:50.770\nAnd there we go.\n\n435\n00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:56.170\nAgain, we could change this if\nwe need to run again SharePoint.\n\n436\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:00.370\nSo, the client performance analyzer,\n\n437\n00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.260\nif I can say that right is\na nice utility to have here.\n\n438\n00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.010\nAll right, and then they give you\nthe ability to use some feedback too.\n\n439\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:15.825\nNow we're gonna test\nExchange from Skype [LAUGH].\n\n440\n00:22:15.825 --> 00:22:20.675\nAnd Skype for Business Admin Center here,\nit also has a tools section.\n\n441\n00:22:20.675 --> 00:22:25.265\nAnd in this tools section it's\ngot a really really cool one, and\n\n442\n00:22:25.265 --> 00:22:28.165\nit's called\nMicrosoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer.\n\n443\n00:22:28.165 --> 00:22:30.620\nNow guys I'm kinda picking on it and\njoking.\n\n444\n00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.280\nThis is a really cool utility.\n\n445\n00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.370\nIt's just the location to me is kind of\noff here because we're gonna be testing\n\n446\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.750\nExchange there.\n\n447\n00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.120\nBut check it out if you\nget the ability to.\n\n448\n00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.040\nYou can always go out to TechNet and just\ntype in remote connectivity analyzer or\n\n449\n00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.191\nyou could just watch us and\nI'll show you exactly what's it about.\n\n450\n00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:46.113\n>> That's what I'm doing.\n\n451\n00:22:46.113 --> 00:22:51.120\n>> That's right, so his is a web site so\nit's all web based web interface here.\n\n452\n00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.500\nAnd it allows you to run some basic tests.\n\n453\n00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.260\nIf you want to troubleshoot\nwhy you might not be able to\n\n454\n00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.320\nconnect to the Exchange online platform.\n\n455\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.511\nSo we can start right\nhere with Office 365.\n\n456\n00:23:02.511 --> 00:23:09.120\nAnd notice that I can do Office 365\nExchange DNS server connectivity test.\n\n457\n00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.280\nWhich is really, like I said,\nI really like this active sync.\n\n458\n00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.760\nIf you've got mobile devices and\none of the things I'm really looking for\n\n459\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.550\nis look at these Internet Email Tests.\n\n460\n00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.220\nMike, I really think this is cool.\n\n461\n00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:26.250\nI can do an inbound SMTP test to see\nif I'm not receiving information right?\n\n462\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.180\nIs that because it's an inbound\nport that's being blocked?\n\n463\n00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.640\nI don't know, right?\n\n464\n00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.310\nAnd you might not be\nthe administrator that can get your\n\n465\n00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.900\nhands on the firewall, right?\n\n466\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.180\nThat might be a network engineer or\n\n467\n00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.920\nsomething that does any\nwork with a firewall and\n\n468\n00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.790\nyou need a real quick test to find out is\nit the firewall that might be blocking it,\n\n469\n00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:47.650\nis the router on your network, your\ngateway may be blocking this information.\n\n470\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:51.180\nAnd what I can do is I can\njust select inbound test.\n\n471\n00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.296\nAnd it gives you really\ngood information there too.\n\n472\n00:23:53.296 --> 00:23:56.575\nSo it just kind of lets you know\nwhat's going on with this test.\n\n473\n00:23:56.575 --> 00:23:58.200\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n474\n00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.187\nAnd now it's gonna ask me for\nthat email address.\n\n475\n00:24:01.187 --> 00:24:05.565\nAnd here's where you guys get to see\nwhat I was talking about my typing\n\n476\n00:24:05.565 --> 00:24:06.716\nabilities here.\n\n477\n00:24:06.716 --> 00:24:12.172\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And they really need to build\n\n478\n00:24:12.172 --> 00:24:18.737\na word processor that is built in any\ndata field I ever have to type in.\n\n479\n00:24:18.737 --> 00:24:21.580\n>> I could probably make a lot of money\nif I can figure out how to do that.\n\n480\n00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.455\n>> Right?\n[LAUGH] Or they'd just say learn to type.\n\n481\n00:24:24.455 --> 00:24:26.880\nAll right, so\nlets put out our little capture.\n\n482\n00:24:28.415 --> 00:24:29.300\n>> Gotta make sure you're human.\n\n483\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.200\n>> Yes, yes verify that we're human.\n\n484\n00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.081\nI am now verified,\n\n485\n00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:36.450\nand one of the great things is,\nI don't have to keep doing this.\n\n486\n00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.680\nLet me see if I can get here so\nyou can see that there.\n\n487\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.000\nWe might not be just\nrunning a single test.\n\n488\n00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.750\nIn fact, here on the show,\nwe're not gonna be running a single test.\n\n489\n00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.660\nWe're gonna go back and\nwe're gonna try the outbound SMTP as well.\n\n490\n00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.809\nWell the great thing is, when you're\nin this browser, once you've verified,\n\n491\n00:24:50.809 --> 00:24:52.492\nlike Mike said, that you're not a robot.\n\n492\n00:24:52.492 --> 00:24:55.772\nWith a capture test,\nit will leave you verified for\n\n493\n00:24:55.772 --> 00:24:59.140\n30 minutes in the session,\nor up to 30 minutes.\n\n494\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.460\nNow that doesn't mean it's gonna store\nyour session cuz if you disconnect and\n\n495\n00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.050\nreconnect, then you'll\nhave to do it again, but\n\n496\n00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.970\nit's nice if you have\nto run multiple tests.\n\n497\n00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:10.300\nYou don't have to keep typing\nthe capture fields in over and over.\n\n498\n00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.230\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nperform the test.\n\n499\n00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.110\nAll right, and you can see that it\nis performing the test right now.\n\n500\n00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:22.040\nAnd it tells you SMTP flow and then it\ngives you the domain or in this case,\n\n501\n00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.470\nthe email address that they're testing.\n\n502\n00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.200\nAll right and\nit gives you some information.\n\n503\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.250\nIt says testing outbound SMPT.\n\n504\n00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.400\nNow Mike, here's another thing\nthat I think is really cool.\n\n505\n00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.860\nThey give you the details\nof what the test is doing.\n\n506\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.530\nRight.\nSome of those troubleshooters that you use\n\n507\n00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.210\ninside of Windows,\nthey don't just randomly say hey this is,\n\n508\n00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:42.260\nit works on the network\ndiagnostics framework.\n\n509\n00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.840\nAn automated approach, right?\n\n510\n00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.580\nYou click a button.\n\n511\n00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.570\nIt says, we didn't solve the problem,\nor we did solve the problem.\n\n512\n00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.300\nIn this case, you can figure out\nwhat the test is actually doing.\n\n513\n00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.220\n>> Nice.\n\n514\n00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.810\n>> All right, so\nthey tell you the test steps here.\n\n515\n00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.410\nWe got to scroll down to that.\n\n516\n00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.783\nMake it a little bit easier there.\n\n517\n00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.360\nAll right, there we go.\n\n518\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.850\nLet me go ahead and just.\n\n519\n00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.801\nThere we go.\nSo, and\n\n520\n00:26:05.801 --> 00:26:09.072\nsome of the additional details that\nyou'll see here is the Time Elapsed, and\n\n521\n00:26:09.072 --> 00:26:10.750\nit'll tell you a delay and stuff.\n\n522\n00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.210\nBut you'll see that it's testing\nthe Mail Exchanger Record.\n\n523\n00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.290\nRight?\n\n524\n00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:17.790\nResolving the names that\nare gonna be used to deliver mail.\n\n525\n00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:18.450\nRight?\n\n526\n00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:23.340\nAnd it says, attempting to send a test\nemail message to such and such.\n\n527\n00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.570\nLet's go ahead and I'll tell you what,\n\n528\n00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:31.170\nlet's look at what it says\ninside of my mail box.\n\n529\n00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.630\nOpen this in a new tab, and\n\n530\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:39.460\nwe'll see if we got a test email in\nthere that was sent by Microsoft.\n\n531\n00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.020\nOkay, there we go.\n\n532\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:44.290\nAnd this is, again,\nyou can see Admin Test Exchange.\n\n533\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:52.270\nAnd then we'll get some information inside\nof this email as to what went on and\n\n534\n00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.810\nthe test that was done.\n\n535\n00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.000\nAnd it just tells you\nthat it was used here.\n\n536\n00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.580\nAnd notice it lets you know Exchange\nServer Remote Connectivity test is a web\n\n537\n00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.110\nsite and exactly what we're looking at.\n\n538\n00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:06.260\nSo it lets me know that\nit can resolve the name.\n\n539\n00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.636\nIt founds the MX records that point back\nto my domain as well as the email address.\n\n540\n00:27:10.636 --> 00:27:15.679\nSo fairly easy tool to use, and\nI tell you Mike, I really like it.\n\n541\n00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:20.080\nOnce you know where it is, there's\na lot of different tests you can do.\n\n542\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.340\nWe could turn around and\n\n543\n00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:25.380\nwe can come back, we can start over if\nwe wanna do things like outbound SMTP.\n\n544\n00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.291\nMaybe I can't send me an emails,\nthat's one of the things that they\n\n545\n00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:31.420\nwant you to know how to do,\ntroubleshoot sending and receiving emails.\n\n546\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:37.400\nWell, if I'm gonna send outbound SMTP,\nwell can I do that?\n\n547\n00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.290\nWe can do the same thing.\n\n548\n00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.930\nAnd I'm not going to go through the test,\n\n549\n00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.320\nthe process is pretty\nmuch the same thing here.\n\n550\n00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.240\nJust what is the outbound IP address\nof where you're going to send\n\n551\n00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.300\nthe email address you tested?\n\n552\n00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.520\nYou don't have to redo the capture\nlike we were talking about.\n\n553\n00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.872\nRun that test and then you will\nsee the results of it as well.\n\n554\n00:27:52.872 --> 00:27:55.050\n>> That's fantastic, they don't\nleave you out there on your own.\n\n555\n00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.970\nThey give you a bunch of tests that you\ncan use to try to do some troubleshooting,\n\n556\n00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.120\nwithout having to come up with\nyou're own ways of testing,\n\n557\n00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.260\nnot that you can't, and\nrun additional tests.\n\n558\n00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.969\nBut this is a great starting point.\n\n559\n00:28:04.969 --> 00:28:05.725\nIt might find.\n\n560\n00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:07.600\nRemember, we like to keep it simple.\n\n561\n00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.350\nSo let's try these built in tools first.\n\n562\n00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.420\nAnd, they look really good, Wes, like\nthey're gonna give us a lot of information\n\n563\n00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.495\nand lead us to where\nthat trouble might be.\n\n564\n00:28:16.495 --> 00:28:17.960\n>> Yes, and it's nice to have.\n\n565\n00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.930\nWe've looked at some of the tools\nthat you use for basic connectivity,\n\n566\n00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:25.910\nlike ipconfig which, like I said, we're\ngonna bundle every all the tools into one\n\n567\n00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.770\nepisode there, but those are some\nbasic tools that you can have.\n\n568\n00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:33.100\nThese task links and I'm really becoming\na fan of a task link, and like I said,\n\n569\n00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:37.060\nI have to kinda take some steps back from\nmy position of a few years back when this\n\n570\n00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.940\nthat came out right ahead.\n\n571\n00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.920\nTask links all over the place and\nI was like, this links just take me here,\n\n572\n00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.500\ntake me to another place that\ntakes me to another place.\n\n573\n00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.950\nI can get there so\nmuch faster going another route.\n\n574\n00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:47.700\nRight?\n\n575\n00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.500\nWell, these links, I have to tell you,\nthey really help you\n\n576\n00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.500\nto test your infrastructure, especially\nif you're having outages or problems.\n\n577\n00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.770\nThe other thing that I want\nto make mention of too,\n\n578\n00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:01.290\nis some called\nthe Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer.\n\n579\n00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:07.460\nIt is another tool that you\ncan use inside of Office,\n\n580\n00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.630\nand if we look here at the Office\n365 interface, you're going to see\n\n581\n00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:17.140\nthat there is this connectivity analyzer.\n\n582\n00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.740\nSo check your Office,\n\n583\n00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.670\nor Office 365 connectivity with\nthe Connectivity Analyzer.\n\n584\n00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:27.420\nDo keep in mind, though,\nthe require and the .NET framework.\n\n585\n00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.820\nWindows 10, I believe,\nhas 4.5 installed by default, but\n\n586\n00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:35.087\nsome of the earlier operating systems you\nmight have to update your .NET framework.\n\n587\n00:29:35.087 --> 00:29:36.390\nAnd, going back to updates,\n\n588\n00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.560\nif you're keeping yourself up to date,\nyou should have those.\n\n589\n00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.250\nIf not,\nyou might have to do a separate download.\n\n590\n00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:45.030\nNow, the next thing that we wanna\nlook at is, I've gone ahead and\n\n591\n00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.690\nalready downloaded this so\nwe don't have to wait.\n\n592\n00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.330\nIf I click on that link, it's gonna do\nthe same thing that the one did before.\n\n593\n00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.830\nIt's gonna give me,\nlike the performance analyzer did.\n\n594\n00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:56.700\nIt's gives me a little MSI file and\nthen I have to install it.\n\n595\n00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.680\nNow on Windows 10 it's\nunder my app section.\n\n596\n00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.860\nAnd we scroll down here,\nit should be Microsoft Corporation.\n\n597\n00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.720\nAnd we have this\nMicrosoft Connectivity Analyzer.\n\n598\n00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:08.600\nAll right.\n\n599\n00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:13.340\nAnd connectivity diagnostics you can see\nsome of the options in here, for instance,\n\n600\n00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.650\nI can't log In with Office Outlook.\n\n601\n00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.270\nSo if I have a problem,\nwhat I can do here is same thing.\n\n602\n00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.453\nI can type the email.\n\n603\n00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.200\nAnd so let's go ahead and\ndo that real quick.\n\n604\n00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.920\nWe'll type our email out.\n\n605\n00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:34.410\nAnd just another one if I type\na valid email format there.\n\n606\n00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:41.610\nThis is another one of those tests that,\nagain, ca be automated for you.\n\n607\n00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:45.460\nAnd email address, we'll just go ahead and\nput that as the, and\n\n608\n00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.581\nI'll do my password here,\ndot, dot, dot, dot, dot.\n\n609\n00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.410\nAnd single sign on where I could\ndo specific settings here.\n\n610\n00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.540\nAnd then what it's gonna do, you can see\nit's gonna do a series of tests, gonna do\n\n611\n00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:01.150\nauto discovery and it's gonna be very\nclose to the one that we've seen before.\n\n612\n00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.830\nIt's going to automate it\nall on the system here.\n\n613\n00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.630\nSo I can actually deploy this out\nto my end users if I need to.\n\n614\n00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.490\nRather than doing just\na web-based interface, right?\n\n615\n00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.990\nI'm connecting to a web-based\ninterface to do the last test,\n\n616\n00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.130\nthis test is actually running\nlocally on the machine.\n\n617\n00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.337\nSo this is something that you\ncan integrate like with, for\n\n618\n00:31:16.337 --> 00:31:17.832\ninstance with your Active Directory.\n\n619\n00:31:17.832 --> 00:31:22.455\nif you wanted to deploy the MSI file and\nthen provision it out to your computers,\n\n620\n00:31:22.455 --> 00:31:26.680\nit would be available and be handy,\nverses a web interface, a website.\n\n621\n00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.890\nSo could take a little bit here\nto show some information here.\n\n622\n00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:34.590\nBut once it's done, we can take\na look at that information and see,\n\n623\n00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.310\nwell some of the data\nthat would be inside it.\n\n624\n00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.920\n>> Absolutely,\n\n625\n00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.450\nI can definitely see making this part\nof my published application sets.\n\n626\n00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.900\nSo that maybe it wouldn't\ninstall on every system, but\n\n627\n00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.630\nif I needed it I can go into\nControl Panel, have it remove programs,\n\n628\n00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.150\nfire that thing up and\ndo some good testing.\n\n629\n00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:50.970\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n630\n00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.330\nSo all great things, Mike, here.\n\n631\n00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:57.410\nWe've got a handful of\ntest that we can run.\n\n632\n00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.680\nWe could couple this with\nbasic troubleshooting skills.\n\n633\n00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:06.010\nUsing built in utilities,\nnetwork troubleshooting utilities here.\n\n634\n00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.650\nAnd here's something that's interesting.\n\n635\n00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.210\nLook here, it tells me unable to log on.\n\n636\n00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.370\nWe failed to authenticate.\n\n637\n00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.450\nNow I can give you one reason that is.\n\n638\n00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.895\n>> [LAUGH] I'm gonna say\nthe password might be incorrect.\n\n639\n00:32:15.895 --> 00:32:19.245\n>> Oh, my password typing\ncapabilities are impeccable.\n\n640\n00:32:19.245 --> 00:32:21.415\nSo, might have to run the test again.\n\n641\n00:32:21.415 --> 00:32:23.185\nSo it says, view detailed results.\n\n642\n00:32:23.185 --> 00:32:26.745\nAnd this'll give you a chance to\nsee what they're doing here, right?\n\n643\n00:32:26.745 --> 00:32:31.470\nAutoDiscovery, and there should be\na Outlook Anywhere connectivity here.\n\n644\n00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.810\nAll right, so they discovered\nthe domain and so that's fine.\n\n645\n00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.190\nThey discovered the target email address.\n\n646\n00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.952\nSo their information is right.\n\n647\n00:32:37.952 --> 00:32:40.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's my information that was wrong,\n\n648\n00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.930\nand that's typically the password,\n\n649\n00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.370\nwhich I can tell you, might be\nsomething that you're troubleshooting.\n\n650\n00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.160\nI was picking on Mike here at\nthe beginning of the episode, but\n\n651\n00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.490\nnow it looks like I'm throwing\nthat one back at myself here.\n\n652\n00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:56.573\nAnd it looks like it's me that's\nhaving the problem typing a password,\n\n653\n00:32:56.573 --> 00:33:00.170\nso Mike again those are some\nof the cool utilities.\n\n654\n00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:03.240\nWe've still got some more to look at,\nbut, a lot of built-in stuff.\n\n655\n00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.440\nAnd the GUI, it can make\na convenient way to troubleshoot\n\n656\n00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.410\nconnecting to your online exchange.\n\n657\n00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:09.920\n>> All right.\n\n658\n00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.860\nFantastic, Wes.\n\n659\n00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.860\nAnother great episode,\na lot of good demos in there.\n\n660\n00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.270\nSome of those tools that\nMicrosoft makes freely available\n\n661\n00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:20.770\nto help us test connecting our users\nout there to our exchange online setup.\n\n662\n00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:21.550\nThank you for that, Wes.\n\n663\n00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.190\n>> Yeah.\n>> We appreciate it.\n\n664\n00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.050\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n665\n00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:24.850\nThat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n666\n00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:27.100\nWe got more to go, but\nwe're gonna have to sign off for this one.\n\n667\n00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.280\nWe'll come back, and\nshow you a little more.\n\n668\n00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.870\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n669\n00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:31.630\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n670\n00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:32.972\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n671\n00:33:32.972 --> 00:33:37.980\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.160\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.440\nToday, we're doing our\nMTA Cloud Fundamentals and\n\n5\n00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.360\nspecifically in this episode we're\nlooking at supporting Exchange online.\n\n6\n00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.570\nNow this is Part Two so\nin Part One we've already looked at\n\n7\n00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.280\na couple of troubleshooting, if I can get\nthat out, methodologies that we might use.\n\n8\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.010\nIncluding some things that we might\ndo on the client end as well as some\n\n9\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.400\nonline testing tools that\nMicrosoft provides for us.\n\n10\n00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.033\nWe're gonna continue on with that theme\nhere and take a look at a few more things\n\n11\n00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:46.132\nthat we might have to troubleshoot,\nlike delegating mailboxes.\n\n12\n00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:50.995\nA lot of times we have to give somebody\nelse the ability to monitor our mailbox,\n\n13\n00:00:50.995 --> 00:00:55.125\nmaybe while we're out of the office or\nwe're an upper level exec or\n\n14\n00:00:55.125 --> 00:01:00.400\nwe might be the person that needs to\nmonitor somebody else's mailbox for them.\n\n15\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.460\nRespond to emails while their out\nof the office or what have you and\n\n16\n00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.930\nwe need to get access and\nwe can't get access to their mailbox.\n\n17\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.410\nWe're gonna look a couple of things like\nthat as well as throw in some PowerShell.\n\n18\n00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.340\nI mean, what would troubleshooting\nbe without a little PowerShell?\n\n19\n00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.490\nTo help us walk through all of that,\nwe have Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n20\n00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.230\nHow's it going, Wes?\n\n21\n00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.140\n>> Going good and thanks for\nhaving me back here.\n\n22\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.320\nAs always, great to be here with ITProTV.\n\n23\n00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.210\nAnd that's one of the first\nthings we are going to look at.\n\n24\n00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.410\nAnd that's the delegation of access or\ndelegation, I should say,\n\n25\n00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.310\nover a mailbox inside of Outlook,.\n\n26\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.760\nNow we've been really dealing with the web\ninterfaces, the online applications more\n\n27\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.780\nthan we've been dealing with\nsome of the local applications.\n\n28\n00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.720\nBut since we are talking about Exchange,\nwe're gonna have to go loco.\n\n29\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.323\nLoco?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n30\n00:01:42.323 --> 00:01:44.063\n>> [LAUGH] We're gonna have to go local\n\n31\n00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:45.170\nhere not loco [LAUGH].\n\n32\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.074\n>> Muy loco, muy loco.\n\n33\n00:01:46.074 --> 00:01:49.794\n>> That's right and we're gonna have to\nlook at one of the locally installed apps,\n\n34\n00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:51.500\nin this case it's gonna be Outlook.\n\n35\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.080\nSo let's show you what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n36\n00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.680\nI've got my Outlook\nalready pulled up here.\n\n37\n00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.953\nAnd when you are gonna delegate\naccess to a mailbox like Mike said,\n\n38\n00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:04.683\nthe scenario that I've actually set up\nis an IT assistant that maybe the IT\n\n39\n00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:07.223\nmanager is gone on vacation for a week.\n\n40\n00:02:07.223 --> 00:02:11.154\nBut looking for a couple of those\nimportant emails to come in and we need to\n\n41\n00:02:11.154 --> 00:02:15.480\nleave somebody with access so that they\ncan do certain things with the mailbox.\n\n42\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.970\nNow when you're troubleshooting access,\nyou have to know what the permissions\n\n43\n00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.480\nare and you have to know how\nto set them accordingly.\n\n44\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.450\nAnd if you don't, unfortunately, when you\ngo on vacation the person that you've\n\n45\n00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.750\ngiven access or delegated access to that\nmailbox cannot perform the actions or\n\n46\n00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.820\nthe functionalities that you\nthink they might be able to.\n\n47\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.850\nSo let's go ahead and look right here.\n\n48\n00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.910\nSo inside of Outlook\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n49\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.490\ngo to File, and\nwe are going to Account Settings here.\n\n50\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.900\nAlmost thought it was\non the main page there.\n\n51\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.050\nAnd it's halfway down\nthe Account Settings.\n\n52\n00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.410\nYou'll see this Delegate Access.\n\n53\n00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.449\nAnd that's something that\nwe need to look at here.\n\n54\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.530\nAll right now,\n\n55\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.080\nonce this comes up you'll see that I do\nhave an IT Assistance account in here.\n\n56\n00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.890\nLet me go ahead and just show you here,\nlet say, let's remove that account.\n\n57\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.525\nWe'll start from scratch and\n\n58\n00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:06.235\nyou can see this from beginning\nto end on how you set it up.\n\n59\n00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:09.255\nAnd it will also help you when it comes\nto troubleshooting in showing that those\n\n60\n00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.835\nsettings are what we're\ngonna show you here.\n\n61\n00:03:11.835 --> 00:03:15.355\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\ntake this identity and\n\n62\n00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:16.165\nwe're gonna remove them.\n\n63\n00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:22.095\nAll right, and you might set up some kind\nof shared mailbox or shared account for\n\n64\n00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:26.980\nthis, it's really gonna be how\nyour infrastructure's set up.\n\n65\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.130\nYou might have a dedicated\nperson username,\n\n66\n00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.700\nand you're gonna allow that person.\n\n67\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.690\nI made a generic account called\nIT Assistance just for this purpose here.\n\n68\n00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.920\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and choose Add, and\n\n69\n00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.830\nthen it's gonna connect to my\nuser accounts in Azure AD.\n\n70\n00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.280\nAnd you can see here that I do,\n\n71\n00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.710\nin this list, you can see that\nI do have this identity here,\n\n72\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.920\nIT Assistant and we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna add this.\n\n73\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.860\nAll right, and I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose OK, and\n\n74\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.845\nnow here's where\nthe permissions come into play.\n\n75\n00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:06.805\nNotice that there's a lot of things that\nthey can do when it comes to this mailbox.\n\n76\n00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:10.185\nIt really isn't just\nthe emails themselves, right?\n\n77\n00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:12.595\nTasks, inbox, contacts, notes.\n\n78\n00:04:12.595 --> 00:04:15.880\nWell we kinda have to look\nat the permissions here.\n\n79\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.840\nAnd we want to zoom in here and talk\nabout these for a little bit there Mike.\n\n80\n00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.250\nReviewer, notice what they can do.\n\n81\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.210\nThey can see the information.\n\n82\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.180\nA reviewer has read-only access, but\n\n83\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.120\nthis doesn't allow them\nthe ability to send an email.\n\n84\n00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.300\nSo in a situation where maybe\nyou want that IT assistant\n\n85\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.708\nto just see if the email came in, right?\n\n86\n00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.981\nI'm on vacation this week, I just\nneed to know did that email come in,\n\n87\n00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:41.920\nI don't need you to modify it I\ndon't need you to respond to it,\n\n88\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.259\nI just need to be aware of it.\n\n89\n00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.712\nNow, obviously they probably gonna\nhave a cellphone on them but,\n\n90\n00:04:46.712 --> 00:04:50.781\nit at least gives them the ability to look\ninside of the email and the calendar,\n\n91\n00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:53.265\ncuz you might have somebody\nthat needs to know.\n\n92\n00:04:53.265 --> 00:04:55.145\nWell, when you coming back from vacation?\n\n93\n00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:57.695\nOr, when's the next\ngreatest meeting coming up?\n\n94\n00:04:57.695 --> 00:05:00.090\nAnd I might need to see that information.\n\n95\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.980\nNow I can set that.\n\n96\n00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.040\nMaybe that's all I want.\n\n97\n00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.360\nMaybe the calendar here,\nI just want them to be able to review it.\n\n98\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.980\nWell, then I can just set it to reviewer,\nthey can read the items.\n\n99\n00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.180\nBut maybe I wanna go a little\nbit farther than that.\n\n100\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.100\nMaybe we have that assistant that\nis actually helping us schedule\n\n101\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.220\nan appointment with customers,\nwith clients,\n\n102\n00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.000\nwith other employees, if you will.\n\n103\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.540\nVendors.\n\n104\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.839\nWell, I can change it to author.\n\n105\n00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:26.260\nAnd author gives them a little\nmore capabilities, right?\n\n106\n00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.630\nThe permission level, the tasks that they\ncan perform is not only just reading,\n\n107\n00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.880\nit's kinda like we would say\nin the NTFS permissions.\n\n108\n00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.490\nRead and write.\n\n109\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.390\nNot only can I read the information but\n\n110\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.860\nI can make changes to\nthe information as well.\n\n111\n00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.560\nNot changes let's be\ncareful with that one.\n\n112\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.260\nI can create.\n\n113\n00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.960\n>> Create new objects.\n\n114\n00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.340\n>> New objects, yeah, thank you,\nlet me be careful on that one here.\n\n115\n00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.860\nSo maybe I'll leave that to author.\n\n116\n00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.830\nAll right.\n\n117\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.656\nNow, when it goes to tasks, your inbox,\n\n118\n00:05:54.656 --> 00:05:57.530\nremember that's what we're\nreally looking at here.\n\n119\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.220\nMaybe I want them to be able to\nnot only read the information,\n\n120\n00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.540\nto create additional objects, but\nmaybe now, when an email comes in.\n\n121\n00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.710\nMaybe I want them to\nhave almost full control.\n\n122\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.740\nLimited full control I should say,\nover the mailbox itself.\n\n123\n00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.350\nWell this is where the editor comes in.\n\n124\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.340\nThe editor can read,\ncan create new objects, and\n\n125\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.750\ncan even make modifications\nto existing objects.\n\n126\n00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.450\nNow, make sure that whoever you\n\n127\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.160\ndelegate this to is obviously\ngonna be a trusted employee.\n\n128\n00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.660\nWe don't just delegate this to anybody.\n\n129\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.490\nSo, you're gonna have to implement\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n130\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.250\nSo I might want to, let's say, put editor.\n\n131\n00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.940\nWell, Mike, let's go ahead and we'll push\nOK and we'll assign the permissions here.\n\n132\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.470\nAnd takes a little bit of a second and\nonce this is done you should see\n\n133\n00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.570\nthat once the permissions have been set,\nchoose OK, dialogue box should disappear.\n\n134\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.420\nAnd that let's me know that I've now\ndelegated the access over that mailbox.\n\n135\n00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.260\nSo one of the things to keep in mind for\nthe exam is that if the person cannot\n\n136\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.040\nview the email and they should be\nable to at least view the email.\n\n137\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.562\nRemember the reviewer permission,\nthat is important.\n\n138\n00:07:05.562 --> 00:07:09.340\nThe reviewer permission can read items,\nremember the author can not\n\n139\n00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.720\nonly read those items they can also\ncreate we aid an item, or an object.\n\n140\n00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.500\nAnd then the editor is the one\nthat can read, can create, and\n\n141\n00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.510\neven modify existing objects.\n\n142\n00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.538\nSo if they ask you on that exam,\non the MTA Cloud Fundamentals exam,\n\n143\n00:07:23.538 --> 00:07:27.000\nmost likely what they're\ngonna test you on is,\n\n144\n00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.940\ndo you know what the permissions are,\nand do you know where to set it.\n\n145\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.925\nSo that's something that I\nwould definitely be aware of.\n\n146\n00:07:33.925 --> 00:07:35.140\n>> Very good, all right.\n\n147\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.840\nSo easy enough, we're good in there,\nwe can delegate those permissions,\n\n148\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.400\nwe can give somebody else access.\n\n149\n00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.300\nI like the way they've\ngot it broken down too.\n\n150\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.809\nIt's not like you're giving\nsomebody access to everything,\n\n151\n00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:45.860\nyou can be very specific.\n\n152\n00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.294\nI want them to be able to read my calendar\nso that if somebody calls up and they're\n\n153\n00:07:49.294 --> 00:07:52.524\ntalking to my assistant they can tell\nthem that Mike's out of the office for\n\n154\n00:07:52.524 --> 00:07:54.550\nthis meeting or\nthat meeting or what have you.\n\n155\n00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.229\nOr if i need them to be able to Input new\nentries or create a new email, right?\n\n156\n00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:02.320\nI can choose that editor option.\n\n157\n00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.600\nOr the author, if they just need to create\nnew, or the editor if they need to modify\n\n158\n00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.470\nexisting appointments, or\nwhatever they need to do in their task,\n\n159\n00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.890\nif they need to update tasks and\nthings like that.\n\n160\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.990\nThey would need that modify permission\nbecause these are objects that already\n\n161\n00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.760\nexist so they're not creating,\nthey need that change permission.\n\n162\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.689\nFantastic, and relatively straightforward.\n\n163\n00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:21.804\nNice little dropdown list there.\n\n164\n00:08:21.804 --> 00:08:24.167\n>> Yeah, so we've looked at in the whole,\n\n165\n00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:27.713\nin the troubleshooting process\nwe've looked at a handful of\n\n166\n00:08:27.713 --> 00:08:32.830\ntools in the first episode here that you\ncan use to test your connectivity, right?\n\n167\n00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.630\nWe want to start locally, remember,\nbasic tools, your edit S lookup,\n\n168\n00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.850\nyour ping utilities, IP config, but\nthen remember we moved into the online\n\n169\n00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.490\nconnection analyzers, the client\nperformance analyzer that lets me know.\n\n170\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.800\nAre the ports being blocked?\n\n171\n00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.000\nAre the ports available?\n\n172\n00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.994\nAre they open and can they be reached?\n\n173\n00:08:53.994 --> 00:08:58.957\nWe looked at the remote connectivity\nassistant that lets us know can we send\n\n174\n00:08:58.957 --> 00:09:02.120\ninbound and outbound email, SMTP email.\n\n175\n00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.220\nAnd so testing it.\n\n176\n00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.840\nBut one of the things that we've\nbeen really just focused on in this\n\n177\n00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.870\ntroubleshooting process,\nis it's really just a GUI, right.\n\n178\n00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.210\nSo now it's time to get into\nthe PowerShell a little bit more.\n\n179\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.790\nAnd you do have the ability to connect\nto your Office, or I should say,\n\n180\n00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.060\nuse PowerShell to connect to Office 365\nand do some additional troubleshooting.\n\n181\n00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.900\nSo let's go ahead and show you that.\n\n182\n00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.837\nYou can find this website again\nSupport.Office.com here and\n\n183\n00:09:27.837 --> 00:09:31.848\nthey got a pretty good article\nhere on managing Office 365 and\n\n184\n00:09:31.848 --> 00:09:34.531\nExchange online was Windows PowerShell.\n\n185\n00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:39.546\nI do wanna just take a second and\nshow this really quick is the Connect to\n\n186\n00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:44.395\nOffice 365 PowerShell does require\na couple of installations.\n\n187\n00:09:44.395 --> 00:09:47.453\nPieces of software, so let me go and\njust click on this and\n\n188\n00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.317\nwe can just take a real brief look.\n\n189\n00:09:49.317 --> 00:09:52.634\nI've gone ahead and\nI've already installed it ahead of time so\n\n190\n00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.950\nthat we can see\nthe connections being made,\n\n191\n00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.221\nnotice that when it talks about\nConnecting to Office 365.\n\n192\n00:09:58.221 --> 00:10:00.074\nThe topics are the same there,\n\n193\n00:10:00.074 --> 00:10:03.850\nthat they say is managing your\nAzure AD with PowerShell.\n\n194\n00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.760\nSo you're gonna wanna\nclick on this link and\n\n195\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.400\nwhen you click on this link,\nyou know door, in front of a door here.\n\n196\n00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.964\n[LAUGH] It's gonna take you to\nthe two things that you need to\n\n197\n00:10:13.964 --> 00:10:15.559\ninstall to do this.\n\n198\n00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:20.483\nAnd you can see it's the Microsoft\nOnline Services Sign-In Assistant and\n\n199\n00:10:20.483 --> 00:10:23.776\nthen the Active Directory,\nPowerShell Module.\n\n200\n00:10:23.776 --> 00:10:27.573\nYou're going to need both of\nthose in order to do this.\n\n201\n00:10:27.573 --> 00:10:31.382\nNow like I've said, I've gone ahead and\nwent ahead and took the time to do\n\n202\n00:10:31.382 --> 00:10:35.650\nthis ahead of time so that we wouldn't\nhave to worry about waiting here.\n\n203\n00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.500\nAnd you'll see that there's an icon here.\n\n204\n00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.570\nThe icon is the Azure Active Directory\nModule for Windows PowerShell.\n\n205\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.930\nAnd when we open this up, Mike, you're\ngonna see, and let me go ahead and just\n\n206\n00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.850\ntake a real quick second and adjust this\nfont so you guys can see it out there too.\n\n207\n00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.550\nYou're gonna see I mean it's\njust a basic PowerShell, right?\n\n208\n00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.360\nThere's not really anything that's too\ndrastically different than any other\n\n209\n00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.590\nCommand line interface that you would\nsee right, this is your PowerShell.\n\n210\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:03.000\nSo some of the first things that we're\ngonna do here we're gonna run a couple of\n\n211\n00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.770\ncommands to get this connected, one of the\nfirst things that we're gonna do we'll set\n\n212\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.330\na little variable here\nwe'll do user credential,\n\n213\n00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.880\nand then we'll do an equals here,\nremember your spaces there, and\n\n214\n00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.600\nthis is going to be a get dash credential.\n\n215\n00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.730\nAnd I'm going to use the tab\nfunctionality, guys.\n\n216\n00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.740\nYou've seen my typing abilities,\nand I love this in PowerShell where\n\n217\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.570\nif it understands with this\nintellisense that's built in.\n\n218\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.980\nIf it understands enough\nof the command and\n\n219\n00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.050\nyou can cycle through it you\ndon't have to type them all out.\n\n220\n00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.160\nNow this is one of those at what\nit's going to do is it's gonna\n\n221\n00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.380\nsay okay what credentials do you\nwant to put in this variable?\n\n222\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.140\nAll right so what I'm going to do here and\nthis will be challenging for\n\n223\n00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:50.510\nme [LAUGH] is,\ntype our good old credentials.\n\n224\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.030\nSo we'll get that done real quick here.\n\n225\n00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.950\nAnd it's gonna store those credentials\ninside of that variable that we're\n\n226\n00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:04.960\ncreating, so that we can turn around and\nuse that to connect to the online service.\n\n227\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.845\n>> And we could do this without\nthe variable stuff right,\n\n228\n00:12:07.845 --> 00:12:11.050\nwe could just type in\nthe credentials in that command.\n\n229\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.679\n>> Yeah, yes you most definitely could and\n\n230\n00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:18.705\nyou can see how amazing this is right,\nso when you are storing these variables\n\n231\n00:12:18.705 --> 00:12:23.340\nit doesn't look like it really did\nanything so you gotta love that.\n\n232\n00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:23.850\nAll right so\n\n233\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.230\nthe next thing that we are gonna do is\nwe're gonna take this interface and\n\n234\n00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.450\nwe're gonna do a Connect Dash, and\n\n235\n00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:34.950\nthen this is MSOL service, and\nI'm going to tab on this one, alright.\n\n236\n00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.150\nAnd then we're going to use\nour credential parameter.\n\n237\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.010\nAnd then that variable\nthat we just created.\n\n238\n00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:45.090\nNow Mike, I really like this too\nbecause it tabs two variables too.\n\n239\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.820\n>> I know, it is hard.\n\n240\n00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.080\n>> It is a,\ndefinitely a powerful shell, you know,\n\n241\n00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.860\nall pun intended here and we'll enter\nthis and it's gonna tell us, well,\n\n242\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.180\nall right,\nhopefully you're connected here.\n\n243\n00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.200\nThe next thing I'm gonna do is type out,\nsee,\n\n244\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.000\nthat's some good typing\nskills there right.\n\n245\n00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.234\nWe're gonna create another variable and\nwrap this up here too and like I said,\n\n246\n00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:08.008\nall these documentation, if you're looking\nfor some of the PowerShell command, what's\n\n247\n00:13:08.008 --> 00:13:12.030\nin order to do this, it's thoroughly\ndocumented on that web site I showed you.\n\n248\n00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.329\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll store that.\n\n249\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.470\nAll right, so next thing we have we've\ngot, now what we have to do is we actually\n\n250\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.960\nhave to import our exchange session so\nthat's what we're gonna do here.\n\n251\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.530\nWe're gonna do an import and\nthis is gonna be -PSSession and we're\n\n252\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:35.692\ngonna use that variable that we just wrap\nup there right, $Session and it finds it.\n\n253\n00:13:35.692 --> 00:13:39.310\nAll right now notice what it's doing\nis it's taking this little script and\n\n254\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.490\nit's downloading it to\nour local machine and\n\n255\n00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.400\nyou can see it running\nthrough here as it's doing.\n\n256\n00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.030\nBut we've got a red line here.\n\n257\n00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.430\nAll right, so let's look at the red\nline here and see what it means.\n\n258\n00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.900\nFiles cannot be loaded because running\nscripts is disabled on the system.\n\n259\n00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.690\nAnd then it's gonna say over here to\nthe side, kind of hard to see there,\n\n260\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.300\nis the provide a valid certificate\nin which to sign the files.\n\n261\n00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:09.140\nNow you might be asking yourself\nwhat's going on here, all right.\n\n262\n00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.790\nAnd one of the things that you\nhave to keep in mind is that by\n\n263\n00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:16.230\ndefault your Windows machines do\nnot allow scripts to be run, right.\n\n264\n00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.620\nWe don't want just anybody to be\nable to connect to our machine and\n\n265\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.780\nstart running scripts on it.\n\n266\n00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.840\nSo let me show you how we can verify that.\n\n267\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.820\nWe're going to do a Get-ExecutionPolicy\nand we're going to run this,\n\n268\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.820\nand if you notice here,\nMike notice how that says Restricted.\n\n269\n00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.700\nSo that's the reason we're\ngetting the red line, and\n\n270\n00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.335\nsince this is troubleshooting Online\nExchange maybe you're trying to connect to\n\n271\n00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:42.662\nit to verify what's going on with your\nExchange Online Service at the time and\n\n272\n00:14:42.662 --> 00:14:46.785\nyou're getting this error, that's because\nyou have to change the execution policy\n\n273\n00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:50.530\nand by default weather we're\ntalking about really any scripts\n\n274\n00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.290\nthat you might be running whether you're\ndoing things like remoting, PS remoting,\n\n275\n00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.700\nremote administration you need\nto change the scripts here.\n\n276\n00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.150\nSo we can remember your verb noun\nsyntax that we're getting at\n\n277\n00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.420\ndash execution policy.\n\n278\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:08.780\nNow we're gonna do a set dash execution\npolicy and this is gonna be a space.\n\n279\n00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.870\nNow, there's a couple different\nthings that we could do here.\n\n280\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.810\nWe could do all signed.\n\n281\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.940\nWe could do remote signed.\n\n282\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.170\nWe could do unrestricted.\n\n283\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.130\nRight?\nUnrestricted means let everything run,\n\n284\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.092\nand that's not the way you wanna go.\n\n285\n00:15:20.092 --> 00:15:20.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n286\n00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.600\nWe don't wanna let every script run.\n\n287\n00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.430\nRemember, principle of\nleast privilege here.\n\n288\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:29.960\nSo what Microsoft recommends, since their\ndigital certificates are trusted by,\n\n289\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.090\nwell, their operating system,\nwhat we can do here is do a remote sign.\n\n290\n00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.890\nAnd when we enter this it's gonna\nask us a few questions, and\n\n291\n00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.840\nask us if we want to answer these more\nthan once, and I'm gonna chose A.\n\n292\n00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.180\nOh, guess what, here's the other thing.\n\n293\n00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.105\nYou have an idea of why I\ncannot access a registry key?\n\n294\n00:15:50.105 --> 00:15:52.750\n>> PowerShell looks like it need\nsome administrative access.\n\n295\n00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.250\n>> It need administrative access.\n\n296\n00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:54.890\n>> To make changes.\n\n297\n00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:55.810\n>> That's right.\n\n298\n00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.770\nSo let's go ahead and do that there.\n\n299\n00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.870\nSo notice that in this session.\n\n300\n00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.470\nI did not run this as administrator.\n\n301\n00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.860\nSo let's go ahead and change that again.\n\n302\n00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.802\nNow, now we should be able to do a set,\nand\n\n303\n00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:13.352\nlet me adjust the font here for\nyou guys out there.\n\n304\n00:16:13.352 --> 00:16:15.640\n>> Yeah, cuz I was getting\na headache trying to read that.\n\n305\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.830\n>> Oh, I bet.\nOh, my goodness.\n\n306\n00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.844\n>> [LAUGH] While he's fixing that,\n\n307\n00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:19.240\na couple of things that\nwe want to point out.\n\n308\n00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.953\nOne of the first things,\nI want to make sure you realize is,\n\n309\n00:16:21.953 --> 00:16:24.180\nthose scripts are running locally, right?\n\n310\n00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.150\nSo instead of, you think that you're\nconnecting to this online tool,\n\n311\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:32.930\nyou're grabbing that session information,\njust keep in mind the scripts are getting\n\n312\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.450\ndownloaded and\nran locally on your machine.\n\n313\n00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.390\nAnd that's why we've got to change\nthat execution policy cuz as Wes said,\n\n314\n00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.790\nby default,\nall of those scripts are gonna be blocked,\n\n315\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.180\nwhether they are local scripts or\nthey are downloaded scripts.\n\n316\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.810\nAnd that's to keep your machine safe,\nright.\n\n317\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.620\nPowerShell, extremely powerful,\nhas access to everything.\n\n318\n00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.020\nRight.\nYour entire operating system,\n\n319\n00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.892\nthe registry, your hard drive, all your\nfiles, so scripts can be malicious.\n\n320\n00:16:54.892 --> 00:16:57.820\nSo, it's reason that we want to make\nsure we keep ourselves protected.\n\n321\n00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.980\n>> Definitely, and the other thing that\nyou also want to keep in mind too,\n\n322\n00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.610\nis PowerShell connecting to your\nonline exchanges, it's got built in,\n\n323\n00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:08.720\non their end, it's got built in DOS,\nDenial of Service protection, so\n\n324\n00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.060\nyou're only allowed three active\nremoting sessions from your,\n\n325\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.850\ninto your exchange online.\n\n326\n00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:19.286\nSo, one of the things that you want to\nremember is that, if you're going to,\n\n327\n00:17:19.286 --> 00:17:20.022\nif you just close down, like I did,\n\n328\n00:17:20.022 --> 00:17:24.880\nif you just close down PowerShell,\nthat doesn't disconnect,\n\n329\n00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.630\nthat disconnects you from your session,\nbut it doesn't close the session open.\n\n330\n00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.640\nIt's still open,\nyou're just no longer connected to it.\n\n331\n00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.010\nSo, if you end up having\nthree connections, and\n\n332\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.650\nthen you try to connect again and\nit doesn't allow you, you're gonna have to\n\n333\n00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:40.480\nwait until one of those sessions\nthat you've got connected expires.\n\n334\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.660\nSo, we'll go ahead and set this.\n\n335\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.800\nWe'll try this again with\nadministrative level privileges.\n\n336\n00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.930\nAnd notice it didn't give me a hard\ntime but now what we wanna do is,\n\n337\n00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.210\nwe always wanna verify\nthat you have set that.\n\n338\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.000\nAnd if you notice now,\nwe have the RemoteSigned here,\n\n339\n00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.880\nso hopefully we're gonna be good.\n\n340\n00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:04.311\nAnd I do want to now do what is\nknown as the import-PSsession.\n\n341\n00:18:08.051 --> 00:18:10.410\nAnd let me try that again.\n\n342\n00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.590\nImport-PSSession.\n\n343\n00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:17.770\nLooks like I might have to start that\nsession over again real quick, so\n\n344\n00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:23.140\nlet me just rerun that big\nold long session again.\n\n345\n00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.265\nAnd, let's see here.\n\n346\n00:18:27.265 --> 00:18:29.346\n[SOUND] Oh, oh, okay, so\n\n347\n00:18:29.346 --> 00:18:34.513\ngood thing about this is we do\nhave to just rerun it real quick.\n\n348\n00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:36.100\nSo let me go ahead and do that.\n\n349\n00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.990\nLet me, when in doubt,\nwe'll trouble shoot it real quick.\n\n350\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:44.010\nWe'll go ahead and\njust set a variable again.\n\n351\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:49.680\nI think it might have, lost it there.\n\n352\n00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.126\n>> Yeah, once you restarted that session.\n\n353\n00:18:51.126 --> 00:18:53.722\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah, it says I don't\nknow what you are talking about.\n\n354\n00:18:53.722 --> 00:19:00.410\n[LAUGH] And we'll go ahead and hey,\ngreat thing to troubleshoot here.\n\n355\n00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.350\n>> Great exercise on scope of\nvariables when using PowerShell.\n\n356\n00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.030\n>> That's right.\n\n357\n00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.690\nAll right.\n\n358\n00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:11.290\nAnd Guido asking you echo dollar sign, and\nI believe for any, if like you want to\n\n359\n00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.830\nsee that output on the screen,\ncuz PowerShell's not very forthcoming with\n\n360\n00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.990\ninformation, if you type it in correctly,\nit doesn't show you anything.\n\n361\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.290\nThe only time it spits out a bunch of info\nis when it's red and you've got a problem.\n\n362\n00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.750\nYou can do a pass through, typically,\n\n363\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:29.700\non most commands, will let you see what\nthe command is doing in the background.\n\n364\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.950\n>> All right, so we got our service here,\nwe're gonna do our credential parameter,\n\n365\n00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.700\nand like I said, thank goodness for\nthe tab functionality.\n\n366\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.380\nIt's amazing.\n\n367\n00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.110\nAnd now what it's gonna do is,\nit's gonna take that, sorry,\n\n368\n00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:47.740\nit's gonna connect me to the Office\n365 platform, all right.\n\n369\n00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.390\nHopefully, I've typed the password in.\n\n370\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.240\nIf I get no information, no red lines,\n\n371\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.080\nthat typically means\nthat you have connected.\n\n372\n00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.870\nAll right.\n\n373\n00:19:54.870 --> 00:20:03.015\nAnd now what we'll do is\nour import PSSession here.\n\n374\n00:20:03.015 --> 00:20:05.810\nWe gotta use that variable that\nwe started out with, right?\n\n375\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.440\nSo $Session, it's there.\n\n376\n00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.410\nAnd now we'll see if it will run that\nscript again, and when it runs the script\n\n377\n00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:16.370\nhere, one of the things that you'll\nnotice is that It shouldn't redline.\n\n378\n00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.250\nAnd while that's finishing here,\noh okay, there we go.\n\n379\n00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.220\nSo we see the script now.\n\n380\n00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:26.120\nThose of you that are aware of PowerShell,\nwe've talked about the verb-noun syntax.\n\n381\n00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.960\nWhen you connect to the Office Exchange,\nor excuse me, Exchange Online, it lets you\n\n382\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.520\nknow right away that it's not following\nthe traditional verb structure there.\n\n383\n00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.430\nAnd if you want to get more information\non it, you can always download it.\n\n384\n00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:44.132\nBut what I really want to see is\na contrast between a machine that\n\n385\n00:20:44.132 --> 00:20:49.186\ndoes not have,\nit looks like it went to sleep here on me,\n\n386\n00:20:49.186 --> 00:20:57.550\nthat doesn't have any of the Exchange\nOnline PowerShell options built-in, right.\n\n387\n00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.820\nPowerShell, you add the modules\nthat you need, right.\n\n388\n00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.340\nAnd when you add\nthe modules that you need,\n\n389\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.910\nthis is what gives you the ability\nto perform that functionality.\n\n390\n00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:12.250\nSame thing in Active Directory here,\nand so\n\n391\n00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.050\nif I was to do, for instance, inside of\nPowerShell, let's see if I can do this in\n\n392\n00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:21.370\nanother instance of PowerShell that\nis not connected directly, and\n\n393\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.080\noh, that is a really difficult to see,\nMike.\n\n394\n00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:30.540\nWe'll put that up a little bit more than\nlike 10,000 by 5,000 resolution in there.\n\n395\n00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.160\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n396\n00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.337\nAnd let me go ahead and\ntype a get-mailbox, all right.\n\n397\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.470\nAnd notice that it says\nthe term get-mailbox,\n\n398\n00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.470\nnot a recognized name of commandlet.\n\n399\n00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.300\nWell, I know that's\nan exchange commandlet, right?\n\n400\n00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.500\nIf I've got an exchange server 2013,\nand I do a get-mailbox, it does that.\n\n401\n00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.330\nIt's because, it's not,\nthe modules aren't imported.\n\n402\n00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.340\nBut let's see what it does now that\nwe've connected to the Office or\n\n403\n00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.870\nthe Exchange Online.\n\n404\n00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.958\nIf I turn around and I run that same\ncommandlet here, we'll do our clear,\n\n405\n00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:06.580\nmake that a little easier to see for\nyou guys out there.\n\n406\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.510\nAnd I do a Get-Mailbox.\n\n407\n00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:12.440\nI can tab, right, and notice that it\nfilled that commandlet in right away.\n\n408\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.730\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna connect out there, and\n\n409\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:20.460\nI can see all of the mailboxes\nthat we have set up.\n\n410\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.085\nNow, that let's me know right away that I\nhave connected the Exchange Online through\n\n411\n00:22:25.085 --> 00:22:25.790\nPowerShell, right.\n\n412\n00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:29.150\nI now have those commandlets\navailable cuz there\n\n413\n00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:33.760\nthe module is inside of this\nAzure Active Directory with PowerShell.\n\n414\n00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.760\nNow, some of the things that might cause\nproblems, you might have, for instance,\n\n415\n00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.330\nmalware filter policies in place and you\ncan always check these out if you want to,\n\n416\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:47.255\nyou can do a get-malware, put a little bit\nmore information in there, there we go.\n\n417\n00:22:47.255 --> 00:22:51.210\nGet-MalwareFilterPolicy and\nyou can see if you've\n\n418\n00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.270\ngot an antimalware policy that's in place,\nyou typically have a default policy.\n\n419\n00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.200\nI can go further than this,\ntoo, again because of some of\n\n420\n00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.500\nthe policies that you might put in\nplace might cause problems, so I could\n\n421\n00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:07.479\ndo Get-HostedConnectionFilterPolicy and\nyou can see the default is in place there.\n\n422\n00:23:08.692 --> 00:23:13.200\nAll right, we can also do,\nfor instance, Get-- and\n\n423\n00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.090\nthe next one is the hosted\ncontent filter policy.\n\n424\n00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.570\nMake sure I get that hosted in there.\n\n425\n00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.520\nAnd I can see if we've got spam filter\nright in place here, so next thing\n\n426\n00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.920\nI might want to do is maybe the hosted\noutbound, so I can do that likewise.\n\n427\n00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.595\nSo all these different little commandlets\nyou can do to check your policies,\n\n428\n00:23:37.595 --> 00:23:42.675\nmake sure that it's not your policies\nthat are causing the problem.\n\n429\n00:23:42.675 --> 00:23:47.342\nI typed that wrong,\nthat's Get-HostedOutboundSpamFilterPolicy.\n\n430\n00:23:47.342 --> 00:23:50.930\nAll right, and I can see if I've got\nmultiples of these in place that maybe\n\n431\n00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.450\nare causing a problem for\nsending and receiving emails.\n\n432\n00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:58.020\nBut fairly easy to connect\nto the Exchange Online,\n\n433\n00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.090\njust keep in mind that it\nis the same process and\n\n434\n00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.540\nthe same two applications that you have\nto install, if you're gonna connect\n\n435\n00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:09.540\nto Azure Active Directory,\nwhich is is the online service there.\n\n436\n00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.820\nSo follow those steps and then what you\ncan do is you can just bump right on over\n\n437\n00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.220\nto the Office 365 support website, and\n\n438\n00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:20.470\nthey'll show the exact commandlets that\nyou run in order to get connected and\n\n439\n00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:23.170\nthen you can verify and\ntest Exchange Online, at\n\n440\n00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:27.320\nleast from an administrative standpoint to\nverify whether you've got a configuration,\n\n441\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.380\nmaybe that you've set in place that's\ncausing the connection outage.\n\n442\n00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.440\n>> Fantastic, Wes.\n\n443\n00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.920\nA lot of great information and\nsome really cool demos there.\n\n444\n00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.960\nWe took a look at delegation of mailbox,\ncalendars, tasks, things like that,\n\n445\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.670\nthe different permissions that\nwe have to be familiar with\n\n446\n00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:45.450\nin order to delegate just what we need to,\nto whomever we're delegating to.\n\n447\n00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.380\nAs well as some look at Powershell,\nhow we can take Powershell and\n\n448\n00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:54.180\nconnect out to our cloud services, and\nthen use Powershell, if I can say that,\n\n449\n00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.260\nlocally, and to start troubleshooting,\nor working with, our Exchange Online.\n\n450\n00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.990\nThanks Wes, appreciate all that.\n\n451\n00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.140\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n452\n00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.750\nSigning off I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n453\n00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.720\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n>> And we'll see ya next time.\n\n454\n00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.600\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.423\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:20.449\nToday, we're doing our\nMTA Cloud Fundamentals and\n\n5\n00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.288\nspecifically in this episode we're gonna\nbe looking at SharePoint and OneDrive.\n\n6\n00:00:25.288 --> 00:00:29.120\nAnd how we can troubleshoot connectivity\nto those types of services, right?\n\n7\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.940\nVery important services, fantastic,\n\n8\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.140\nwe get to, one of the great benefits\nof going to the Cloud as the ability\n\n9\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.730\nto put information out there whether\nit's documents or whatever we need to.\n\n10\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.390\nAnd then access it from anywhere we are,\nanywhere with internet access, right?\n\n11\n00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.980\nThat's a great thing.\n\n12\n00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.320\nIf I can connect to it.\n\n13\n00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.420\nSo here to help us to make sure we can\nstay connected to our online resources,\n\n14\n00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.080\nWes Bryan.\n\n15\n00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.770\nHow's it going, Wes?\n\n16\n00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.230\n>> It's going great, Mike, and as always,\nthanks for having me back here.\n\n17\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.870\nAnd that's right.\n\n18\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.480\nWe're gonna be looking\nat SharePoint today, and\n\n19\n00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.620\nsome of the things that we need to look\nat when it comes to troubleshooting.\n\n20\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.490\nWhether it'd be a connectivity issue or\nmaybe somebody even logging in.\n\n21\n00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.280\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in here.\n\n22\n00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.720\nOne of the first things you need to do for\nthe MTA Cloud fundamentals exam\n\n23\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.570\nis to identify the storage\nlimits with inside the platform.\n\n24\n00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.490\nWe need to figure out what is the limit\nwhen it comes to synchronizing information\n\n25\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.000\nup to the Cloud because they\ndo have some limitations.\n\n26\n00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.270\nNow I've actually pulled\nup a website here and\n\n27\n00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.710\nthere's a lot of good\ndocumentation out there guys.\n\n28\n00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.270\nSo you can use this information and\nit talks about some of the limitations in\n\n29\n00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.220\nthe Office Online 365 plans and for the\nmost part there's subtle differences but\n\n30\n00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.710\nthe ones that we're looking at is more for\nthe business and the enterprise.\n\n31\n00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.170\nIf I scroll down a little bit here,\nI believe you'll see they have\n\n32\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.140\nlike the kiosk plans, and\nthen the government plans.\n\n33\n00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.700\nBut for the most part,\n\n34\n00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.700\nnot too much difference here\nwhen it comes to these plans.\n\n35\n00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.080\nSome of the first things we\nneed to look at is, well,\n\n36\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.635\nhow do you identify what you can\nexpect as far as the storage itself?\n\n37\n00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:07.535\nAnd there's an easy way to calculate this.\n\n38\n00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:11.095\nOne of the things to keep in mind is that\nyou start out with ten gigabytes and\n\n39\n00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:13.505\nthen the formula here,\nit really is simple, right.\n\n40\n00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:19.025\nYou have ten gigabytes and\nthen it's 500 megabytes per user.\n\n41\n00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.420\nRight, now that doesn't seem like a lot,\nbut when you look at it here,\n\n42\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.990\nlet's just imagine we've got 10,000\nusers in our network, right.\n\n43\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.330\nWe're an enterprise level network,\nwe've got a lot of users, so\n\n44\n00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.610\nif we were going to figure this out,\nwe got 10,000 users, right.\n\n45\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.026\nSo what would that be?\n\n46\n00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:43.525\nThat would be ten gigabytes and\nthen it'd be plus\n\n47\n00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:48.037\n500 megabytes, and\nthat what would that be?\n\n48\n00:02:48.037 --> 00:02:51.500\nTimes the 10,000 users here.\n\n49\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.492\nWell, when you look at that,\nwhat does that workout to?\n\n50\n00:02:54.492 --> 00:02:58.065\nAbout 5 million megabytes, I think,\nif my math's correct here.\n\n51\n00:02:58.065 --> 00:02:58.673\n>> You're beyond me.\n\n52\n00:02:58.673 --> 00:03:02.075\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was ready to get my calculator\n\n53\n00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:02.735\nfor that one.\n\n54\n00:03:02.735 --> 00:03:05.815\n>> That's right or if we want the quick,\n\n55\n00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:10.392\nshortened version here that would\nbe around five terabytes of data.\n\n56\n00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:16.082\nSo at first, it doesn't seem like\na lot of storage here, but we're\n\n57\n00:03:16.082 --> 00:03:22.710\nreally talking about what you can store\ninside of your, in SharePoint itself.\n\n58\n00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.120\nSo, again keep that in mind you are given\nten gigabytes and then 500 megabytes per\n\n59\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.190\nuser and as you scale up you're definitely\ngonna accrue more storage space.\n\n60\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.172\nKeep in mind that SharePoint and\nOneDrive were kind of,\n\n61\n00:03:35.172 --> 00:03:40.060\nSharePoint is more of the front end\nwhere the, OneDrive is where we're gonna\n\n62\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.430\nstore all that data and SharePoint's\nhow we can access that information.\n\n63\n00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.730\nSo it is good to know.\n\n64\n00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.630\nThe other thing that we also wanna keep\nin mind is a per site collection, or\n\n65\n00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.810\na per site I should say,\nper site collection.\n\n66\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.030\nThat's a site collection here is what you\ndo when you setup your first sites inside\n\n67\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.950\nof SharePoint and\nit basically becomes this hierarchy.\n\n68\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.170\nAnd then additional users can\ncreate their sites under that\n\n69\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.460\nwhile per site collection, we're looking\nat about one terabyte per site collection.\n\n70\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.380\nAnd you can have multiple\nsite collections as well.\n\n71\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.280\nNow, I say that,\nthat's for the exam, okay.\n\n72\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.080\nWhen you start a trial subscription like\nyou've seen here that we've been using\n\n73\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.500\nthroughout this series.\n\n74\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.170\nYou don't get that one terabyte for\na trial subscription.\n\n75\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.300\nThat's a paid subscription,\n\n76\n00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.120\nso your trial subscription is gonna\nonly really be 25 gigs to start with.\n\n77\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.660\nAnd let's just really think about it,\n\n78\n00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.820\nyou're not jumping into the deep end of\nthe pool, you're kinda testing the water\n\n79\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.510\nout, seeing how cool it is, or\nif it's gonna work for you.\n\n80\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.730\nSo they don't really give you those\nlarger storage amounts until you get into\n\n81\n00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.600\na paid subscription.\n\n82\n00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.370\nNow, personal sites, right?\n\n83\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.430\nPersonal site storage is\nalso a terabyte as well.\n\n84\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.590\nThe other ones we have\nare the Office 365 group storage.\n\n85\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.320\nNow this is something that's a little bit\ndifferent, new, when we talked about for\n\n86\n00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.650\ninstance, we talked about Exchange online.\n\n87\n00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.540\nWe've talked about creating things\nlike distribution groups, right?\n\n88\n00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.652\nTraditional way to send out\nemail blasts to multiple people.\n\n89\n00:05:07.652 --> 00:05:11.750\nAnd Office 365 brought in that\nnew feature, that groups feature,\n\n90\n00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.328\nthat integrates with the SharePoint site.\n\n91\n00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:18.603\nSo I can do things like have a group\nof people sharing documents,\n\n92\n00:05:18.603 --> 00:05:20.991\nsharing the same calendar as well.\n\n93\n00:05:20.991 --> 00:05:25.279\nSo that's what we're talking about when we\nsay those group sites now we've got one\n\n94\n00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:27.249\nterabyte of group storage there too.\n\n95\n00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:29.867\nNow you've got a fairly decent amount,\n\n96\n00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:34.080\ndepending on what you gonna\ndo with your public websites.\n\n97\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.219\nYour public websites in SharePoint are\ngonna be allocated five gigs and, Mike,\n\n98\n00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:43.220\nwe were actually talking about this\nyesterday, when you look at a webpage and\n\n99\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.410\nMike, I know you've been around webpages\nbefore, for sure, and even made some.\n\n100\n00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.090\nI was like, well, five gigs,\n\n101\n00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.520\nthat really doesn't sound like\nyou've got a lot of storage.\n\n102\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.900\nBut, you had pointed out well,\nit's just text.\n\n103\n00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.569\nSure, if you're storing things\nlike high definition video.\n\n104\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.730\nYou can accrue a lot of space, but\ntypically this is not gonna be.\n\n105\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.070\nRemember what SharePoint is?\n\n106\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.140\nSharePoint's more about\nteam collaboration, and\n\n107\n00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.240\neven collaboration with\nan external organization.\n\n108\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.120\nSo, you're probably not gonna be\nstoring things like your videos.\n\n109\n00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.340\nSo, they do give you,\nallocate you a little bit of space for\n\n110\n00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.470\nyour public websites there.\n\n111\n00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.360\n>> Nice.\nVery nice and\n\n112\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.960\nthen of course all these\nnumbers are influx?\n\n113\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.272\n>> Yep.\n>> As plans change and\n\n114\n00:06:21.272 --> 00:06:24.945\nas Microsoft changes what\nthey want to limit to you.\n\n115\n00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:28.410\nSo you got to kinda study these\nnumbers for the exam, but\n\n116\n00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.580\nthen in the real world make sure\nyou go out and do your research,\n\n117\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.440\ncuz it's very dependent on what plan\nyou're getting and when it occurs.\n\n118\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.080\n>> That's right, yeah, definitely.\n\n119\n00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.630\nNow the other thing that they do call out\non the exam is troubleshooting something\n\n120\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.300\nknown as open with explorer.\n\n121\n00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.070\nYou have the ability to basically\nto connect to your SharePoint site,\n\n122\n00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.410\nfor instance, your team site,\nfirst site that you create.\n\n123\n00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.260\nAnd if you wanna view the files that you\nhave inside of SharePoint, they give you\n\n124\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.020\nthe ability rather than just looking at it\nin the web browser is synchronizing that\n\n125\n00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.490\ninformation with File Explorer so\nyou can see the more traditional fashion.\n\n126\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.440\nGuys who are seeing File Explorer\nout there remember that\n\n127\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.450\nWindows Explorer has been what's\ncalled for the last 30 years or\n\n128\n00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.395\nso and when Windows 8 came\nout they just renamed it,\n\n129\n00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:16.790\nre-branding of an older technology\nincluding some additional features.\n\n130\n00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.780\nSo, if you're not used to that term,\nFile Explorer, no guys,\n\n131\n00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.800\nwe're really not talking about anything\nother than Windows Explorer that you've\n\n132\n00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:30.080\nused to view your files and\nfolders on any Windows system.\n\n133\n00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.660\nNow, let's go ahead and\nshow you what I mean by that.\n\n134\n00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.140\nNow, I've gone ahead and I've logged\ninto the Office 365 admin center, and\n\n135\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.860\nthen from there we've launched into\nfrom the SharePoint admin center, and\n\n136\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.100\nyou can see some of the storage\nlimitations here Mike.\n\n137\n00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.310\nSo there's terabyte limits that we\nsee here, you can see them here,\n\n138\n00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.830\nit says right there storage limitations.\n\n139\n00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.146\nBut what we want to see is\nconnecting to the site itself, so\n\n140\n00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:54.460\nI can do this in a couple different ways.\n\n141\n00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.832\nIf I'm an admin I could turn around and\nI can select the link itself and\n\n142\n00:07:57.832 --> 00:08:01.050\nit'll show me the site\ncollection properties.\n\n143\n00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.320\nOr.\n\n144\n00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.240\nIt's good to see that, so I'm glad you\nguys could take a second to see that.\n\n145\n00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.860\nBut I can also do this\njust by going to Sites.\n\n146\n00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.390\nSo if I go to the app launcher, for\n\n147\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.690\ninstance, and I choose Sites,\nI can launch Sites this way as well.\n\n148\n00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.150\nNow, this takes me right to the main\nwebsite, or SharePoint site,\n\n149\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.960\nthat all your other viewer or\nyour users would see.\n\n150\n00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.030\nNow what I get the ability to do,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n151\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.950\nnavigate into my team\nsite that I have here.\n\n152\n00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.490\nOne that we created in the prior episode.\n\n153\n00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.890\nAnd notice that I've got\nthese documents here.\n\n154\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:37.120\nNow I could, if I wanted to, I could view\nall of those documents just individually\n\n155\n00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.540\nright here in the web interface and\nI'd be just fine.\n\n156\n00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.550\nBut like I said, you might wanna view\nthis in a more traditional explorer like\n\n157\n00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.620\nWindows Explorer,\nthey call it File Explorer today.\n\n158\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.750\nSo what I could do here is\nI can go over to documents,\n\n159\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.560\nnotice that we're on the left hand side\nhere, we go to the documents dashboard.\n\n160\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.350\nAnd then also notice at the top you'll\nsee a couple of different options.\n\n161\n00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.940\nWe'll see browse, we'll see files,\nand then we'll see library.\n\n162\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.050\nLibrary is the one that I want here,\nso we're going to go to the library.\n\n163\n00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.590\nBe quiet we're in the library now.\n\n164\n00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.080\n>> Shh.\n\n165\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.676\n>> Shh [LAUGH].\n\n166\n00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:15.260\nAnd we've got this option\nthat says open with explorer.\n\n167\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.980\nNow, when I choose that, what it will do,\nand it'll take a second here.\n\n168\n00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.130\nBut when you click on that, what that\ndoes is it should take your documents,\n\n169\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.110\nsynchronize them to file explorer, and\n\n170\n00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:31.830\nthen open them up in a traditional\nway that we're used to seeing.\n\n171\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.926\nAnd SharePoint has,\napparently, stopped working.\n\n172\n00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:38.211\n>> [LAUGH] Of, course.\n\n173\n00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:39.946\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just temporarily, though.\n\n174\n00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:42.216\n>> Just temporarily there.\n\n175\n00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.350\n[LAUGH] All right,\n\n176\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.640\nlet's try that again, and\ngood thing we're trouble shooting this.\n\n177\n00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.700\n>> Yes [LAUGH]\n>> Now, one of the things you can also\n\n178\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.960\nmake sure, too, is that your\nclient web service is running.\n\n179\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.890\nAnd we're gonna check\nthat out here coming up.\n\n180\n00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.070\nAgain, with the open with explorer\noption here, when we click this,\n\n181\n00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.510\none of the things that you're gonna\nnotice is that it does bring up there,\n\n182\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.470\nMike, the file explorer.\n\n183\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:10.750\nSo now I can see my documents here in a,\nlike I said, more traditional manner.\n\n184\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.210\nIt doesn't really matter if you wanna use\nit on the web interface, it's just fine,\n\n185\n00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.770\nbut people might be more fluent, they\nmight be a little bit more productive,\n\n186\n00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.610\nworking inside of the graphical\nuser interface here that's based,\n\n187\n00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.550\nthat's built into Windows.\n\n188\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.260\nNow, there are a couple of things here,\nMike, that might cause the problem.\n\n189\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.770\nOne of the first,\nif this isn't working, and\n\n190\n00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.590\nthey do call this out on the exam, they\nwant you to know how to troubleshoot this.\n\n191\n00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.150\nSo, one of the first things that you need\nto do is there is a web client service\n\n192\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.970\nthat you need to make sure is running.\n\n193\n00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.890\nNow, it has a manual startup type,\n\n194\n00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:48.630\nwhich means that it isn't\nturned on until you need it.\n\n195\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.260\nBut, we've probably seen, and\nif you're not aware of this,\n\n196\n00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.110\nyou'll start to become more aware\nof this as you get into IT.\n\n197\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.280\nThat sometimes even if these\nservices are manual and\n\n198\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.560\nthey're suppose to be triggered,\nsometimes they don't trigger too well.\n\n199\n00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.690\nThey're sleeping, you need them, the\noperating system is calling on them and\n\n200\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.630\nthey're just not working.\n\n201\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.440\nSo let me show you how you can\nvery easy way to fix this.\n\n202\n00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:15.200\nIf you right click on your Windows charm\nhere, you will see computer management.\n\n203\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.410\nAll right and then we'll let\ncomputer management come up here and\n\n204\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.410\non the left hand side\ndown at the bottom here,\n\n205\n00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.900\nthe last node here you'll see services and\napplications.\n\n206\n00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.300\nWe'll expand that out and we'll kinda\nzoom in here so you can see it.\n\n207\n00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.160\nSo what I want is the services\nnode here in computer management.\n\n208\n00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.670\nThere's quite a few different\nways to get to services, and\n\n209\n00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.230\nI wanna call that out just in\ncase they ask you on the exam.\n\n210\n00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.800\nBecause one of the things I've seen on\nthese MTA exams is they're gonna ask you,\n\n211\n00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.660\nokay, you need to troubleshoot\nthe web service client for SharePoint,\n\n212\n00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.680\nwhich utility that you use, they might\nnot have computer management up there.\n\n213\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.370\nWhat might they have?\n\n214\n00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:57.670\nThe traditional run line command, and\nthat's services.mike sierra charlie there,\n\n215\n00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.360\nthe .msc, and you can see.\n\n216\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.430\nOr, service, not services.\n\n217\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.230\nIt isn't plural here.\n\n218\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.600\nAnd then when you run that,\noh it doesn't like,\n\n219\n00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.637\nit is services, excuse me,\nI thought it was services, plural.\n\n220\n00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.870\nMake sure that I have this right,\nall right, so services.msc and\n\n221\n00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.199\nyou can see the desktop app here and\nwe wanna go ahead and launch that.\n\n222\n00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.960\nNow fairly easy to find,\nit is alphabetic, or\n\n223\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.466\nalphabetical order here\nof all of the services.\n\n224\n00:12:29.466 --> 00:12:35.520\nIf you want a quick easy way to the one\nthat you're looking for, you can\n\n225\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.540\njust choose the type of the name column\ntype the letter w for web services and\n\n226\n00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.810\nthen we can scroll down here and\nyou're gonna see this web client service.\n\n227\n00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.320\nNow notice that it does say that it is\nrunning but more important than that what\n\n228\n00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.050\nI want you guys to see here is what\nit says that this service does.\n\n229\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.020\nAnd this is a good thing to know.\n\n230\n00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:00.600\nEnables Windows-based programs to create,\naccess and modify internet based files.\n\n231\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.230\nKeep in mind what we're talking here,\nwe're talking about SharePoint,\n\n232\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.180\nwe're talking about opening it in Internet\nExplorer, which is the graphical user\n\n233\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.580\ninterface to view and\nmanage your files and folders on Windows.\n\n234\n00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.410\nAnd it's telling you that this service\nis needed, and it's needed to be running\n\n235\n00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:19.110\nin order for that to happen here in\nthis case in the context of Share Point.\n\n236\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.850\nNow if you double click this service if\nthere's ever a question of whether it's\n\n237\n00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.930\nworking or not, you can always start and\nstop the service.\n\n238\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.190\nNow, I can see that it is running here,\nso I don't really have to worry about it.\n\n239\n00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.235\nBut, that's the first point in figuring\nout why that opened with explorer.\n\n240\n00:13:34.235 --> 00:13:35.695\nIt might not be synchronizing.\n\n241\n00:13:35.695 --> 00:13:37.170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n242\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:42.650\n>> Now, there's another reason the open\nwith explorer might not be working,\n\n243\n00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:43.990\nand let me show you that.\n\n244\n00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.290\nThat really boils down to\nthe fact that you're using,\n\n245\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.218\nwell, Microsoft's Edge browser.\n\n246\n00:13:48.218 --> 00:13:50.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] If you look at\n\n247\n00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.720\nthe documentation here, one of the things\nthat you'll see is that currently that\n\n248\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:01.340\nfeature is completely unsupported\ninside of the Edge browser.\n\n249\n00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.950\nDon't be using the Edge\nbrowser in order to do this.\n\n250\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.680\nI'm not telling you don't use the Edge\nbrowser at all, but at least not for\n\n251\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.750\nthis functionality.\n\n252\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:14.010\nYou're not gonna want it,\nit doesn't support it at this point.\n\n253\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.870\nNow there are some other things\nthat we need to worry about.\n\n254\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.130\nOne of the things that has recently\ncome about is the fact that Microsoft is\n\n255\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:28.280\npulling the plug for support on certain\nolder editions of the Internet Explorer.\n\n256\n00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.670\nSo for instance, you might still\nbe running Windows 7 machines,\n\n257\n00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.380\nand running Windows 8 and 8.1 machines.\n\n258\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.780\nSo, Windows 7 more, I would say more\n\n259\n00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:42.450\ncorrectly is gonna be where you\ncould see things like IE7 and IE8.\n\n260\n00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.960\nIf you are gona try to\nuse this functionality\n\n261\n00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.010\nin some of those older Internet Explorer\nbrowsers, you're gonna need a Hotfix.\n\n262\n00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.830\nAnd that includes Windows or\nInternet Explorer 10,\n\n263\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.720\nwhich is running in Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n264\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:59.110\nAnd they do have a good\nlittle website out there.\n\n265\n00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.070\nSo when we say Hotfixes,\nusually you can download those.\n\n266\n00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.900\nIn fact patch Tuesday, first patch Tuesday\nof 2016 just recently passed yesterday.\n\n267\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.690\n>> Yeah, yesterday.\n\n268\n00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.985\n>> And a lot of times you'll see these\nHotfixes that'll be released out.\n\n269\n00:15:10.985 --> 00:15:12.395\nThis is a little bit different.\n\n270\n00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:18.115\nYou can go down to this website here,\nand one of the things that you can do,\n\n271\n00:15:18.115 --> 00:15:21.345\nI believe if you scroll all the way\ndown to the bottom of this.\n\n272\n00:15:22.365 --> 00:15:23.515\nOh, where is that Hotfix?\n\n273\n00:15:23.515 --> 00:15:25.765\nIt's in here.\nIt's in the documentation here somewhere,\n\n274\n00:15:25.765 --> 00:15:26.885\nI'll find it here in a second.\n\n275\n00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.480\nThere we go.\n\n276\n00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.210\nNotice that it says,\nthey've got a knowledge base article so\n\n277\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.030\nthis is a KB article, and\nif I click this link, it,\n\n278\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.790\nnotice it says that there is\na Hotfix available for download.\n\n279\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:44.210\nAnd then what this does is it automates\nthe process of fixing it for you.\n\n280\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:49.204\nNow, I'll tell you that is kind of\na workaround more than anything.\n\n281\n00:15:49.204 --> 00:15:52.023\nWith Microsoft releasing the fact\nthat they're no longer gonna\n\n282\n00:15:52.023 --> 00:15:55.050\nbe supporting these browsers,\nthe older editions of the browsers,\n\n283\n00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.000\nand they're pulling the plug for support.\n\n284\n00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.253\nYou really should consider if you're\ngonna be using Internet Explorer,\n\n285\n00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:03.662\nyou're in a Windows environment Right\nyou really going to want to be moving to\n\n286\n00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:06.495\nInternet Explorer 11 then you\nwon't have to worry about these\n\n287\n00:16:06.495 --> 00:16:09.390\nthings like that hot fixes for\nhome features and functionality.\n\n288\n00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:16.490\nNow the other thing that you can do to is\nyou can use the keep me signed-in method.\n\n289\n00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:22.180\nLet me go ahead real quick and just\nkind of sign out of my account here and\n\n290\n00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.900\nyou guys will see how difficult it is for\nme to type a password here.\n\n291\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.430\nBut you really have to see this, cuz\nthis is the other option that sometimes\n\n292\n00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:36.510\nthe credentials don't get passed through\nand what you might need to do is just\n\n293\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:42.119\nlog out and then check\nthe Keep Me Signed In option here.\n\n294\n00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:48.020\nAll right, so notice that there is,\nright here, the keep me signed in.\n\n295\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.790\nOne of the things that they say\nmight solve that problem here\n\n296\n00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.825\nis to just check that off, and\nthen when you sign in, hopefully it'll\n\n297\n00:16:56.825 --> 00:17:01.975\nfix the problem as long as you\ncan type your password correctly.\n\n298\n00:17:01.975 --> 00:17:03.335\n>> The passwords are still required.\n\n299\n00:17:03.335 --> 00:17:05.425\n>> Yes, passwords are still required and\n\n300\n00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:07.935\nthey do require you to type\nthem correctly for sure.\n\n301\n00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:13.255\nAll right, so that's one of the things\nthat might help with that too.\n\n302\n00:17:13.255 --> 00:17:16.130\nSo let's go ahead and we'll get\nback to SharePoint here real quick.\n\n303\n00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:20.700\nWe'll get back to our library or\nour documentation I should say.\n\n304\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.340\nDocuments.\n\n305\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.000\nOkay.\n\n306\n00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.940\nNow the other one in a little bit more\ncomplex when it comes to setting this up.\n\n307\n00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.380\nAnd this is gonna be something\nthat you're gonna use SharePoint.\n\n308\n00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.330\nWell PowerShell with\nSharePoint management.\n\n309\n00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:41.186\nNow there's one thing that you have to\ndo in order to use the, the PowerShell,\n\n310\n00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:45.713\nSharePoint on management feature and\nyou can go out to your,\n\n311\n00:17:45.713 --> 00:17:50.900\nagain, that same website I showed you,\nwhere the hot fix is.\n\n312\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:56.380\nAnd you can download and\nlet me get you the exact name here.\n\n313\n00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.375\nI've already downloaded.\n\n314\n00:17:57.375 --> 00:18:01.550\nSharePoint online manager shell,\nit isn't installed by default.\n\n315\n00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:07.190\nSo you do have to go out and\ndownload that module here.\n\n316\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.040\nAnd they do have,\n\n317\n00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.360\nyou can see an introduction to SharePoint\nOnline Management Shell, note that you're\n\n318\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.250\ncomputer doesn't have it installed by\ndefault, this isn't just something is\n\n319\n00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.790\nbuilt into the native power shell\nthat we know is on a Windows machine.\n\n320\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.620\nWell, I've gone ahead and, guys,\nI've already downloaded that so\n\n321\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.750\nwe can,\nwe can see what we're going to do here.\n\n322\n00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.970\nYou notice that one of the things\nthat the keep me signed in does,\n\n323\n00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.289\nright, it stores a session cookie\nin your web browser, right?\n\n324\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.430\nAnd that's how it\nremembers your credentials.\n\n325\n00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.830\nNow, again, keep in mind for\n\n326\n00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:43.720\nsecurity purposes, you know you\nare talking about your admin center.\n\n327\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.620\nYou're talking about storing your\ncredentials inside that browser so.\n\n328\n00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.660\nThis is a slight security vulnerability.\n\n329\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.210\nWe definitely worry about security\nhere at ITpro TV we've talked,\n\n330\n00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.350\nwe've got a lot of episodes on security so\nthe next one that I'm gonna do.\n\n331\n00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.640\nYou have to be careful,\nmake sure it's a private computer.\n\n332\n00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.500\nI would almost recommend making\nsure that if this is done,\n\n333\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.280\nit's only done on the admin\ncenter that you manage it from,\n\n334\n00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.160\nI wouldn't do this on any other\ncomputer so, let's go ahead and\n\n335\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.430\nshow you how you can do set what's\nknown as a persistent cookie.\n\n336\n00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:14.000\nPuts it in the web browser, right, and\neven if you close the web browser down,\n\n337\n00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.900\nyou can delete your history, that\npersistent cookie's gonna still be there.\n\n338\n00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.400\nAnd you're gonna see,\nthey will set up a warning.\n\n339\n00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.610\nSo let's go ahead and do this.\n\n340\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:26.550\nI'm gonna start by just creating a little\nvariable, you don't really have to do this\n\n341\n00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:33.310\nas far as the variable goes but\nI personally,\n\n342\n00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.900\nI like to do it this way because I don't\nhave to continually type the password.\n\n343\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.477\nAs you can see that's a, that is\ndefinitely very challenging for me so\n\n344\n00:19:41.477 --> 00:19:46.251\nwe're gonna go ahead and just Set a little\n\n345\n00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:51.015\nvariable here then hopefully, I actually\ntyped the password right the first time.\n\n346\n00:19:51.015 --> 00:19:55.440\n[LAUGH]\nWelcome to ITProTV\n\n347\n00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.040\nwhere Wes shows you how\nto type a password.\n\n348\n00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.480\nI'm just kidding, guys.\n\n349\n00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.861\n>> I'm gonna guess that your password\nis dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.\n\n350\n00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:02.706\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mike,\n\n351\n00:20:02.706 --> 00:20:06.520\nyou need to quit with that social\nengineering, sir, I tell you.\n\n352\n00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.420\n>> That is a cool command though,\nthat get credential does pop open.\n\n353\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.770\nA nice friendly dialogue box to\ntype in your credentials, and then\n\n354\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.790\nstores it in that variable so that later\ncommands, you can just use that variable.\n\n355\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:17.450\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n356\n00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.690\nNow the other thing that you have to do,\nI would make sure, and\n\n357\n00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.440\nI'm going to tell you what the website is,\n\n358\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.300\nbut the other thing that you have to make\nsure is that you have the right URL for\n\n359\n00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.530\nyou SharePoint admin site and\nreally it's https:// your tenants\n\n360\n00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:35.850\nname dash admin.sharepoint.com.\n\n361\n00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:40.590\nSo again that's going to be more\nspecific to what your tenant is here.\n\n362\n00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.001\nSo the next thing that we're going to do\nis we're going to connect to SharePoint\n\n363\n00:20:44.001 --> 00:20:44.750\nonline.\n\n364\n00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.570\nSo I'm going to run the connect and\nthis will be the SPO for\n\n365\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.165\nSharePoint online, well,\nSharePoint service, excuse me.\n\n366\n00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:51.870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n367\n00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.040\n>> And then, the parameter's gonna be URL.\n\n368\n00:20:56.932 --> 00:21:02.701\nAnd then, we're gonna put in that\nadmin SharePoint website, and\n\n369\n00:21:02.701 --> 00:21:08.059\nfor us here, for\nour demonstration purposes, it's HTTPS,\n\n370\n00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:13.724\ncolon, forward, slash, forward,\nslash, IT PRO TV 001 and\n\n371\n00:21:13.724 --> 00:21:20.350\nthen it's a dash admin.sharepoint and\nI believe it's sharepoint.com.\n\n372\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:25.410\nAll right and then we're going to use\n\n373\n00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:31.575\nour credential parameter as well and\nI'll go ahead from here and\n\n374\n00:21:31.575 --> 00:21:37.620\nuse the user credential\nthat I put in the variable.\n\n375\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.810\nNow hopefully this is connected.\n\n376\n00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.805\nIf you get an output.\n\n377\n00:21:42.805 --> 00:21:45.630\n[LAUGH] We call it redlining\nhere in PowerShell.\n\n378\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.610\nChances are, you've pulled a Wes here and\nyou haven't typed your password correctly.\n\n379\n00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.360\nSo then what you can do is\nyou could just restore.\n\n380\n00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.600\nYou really don't have to\nput the variable in there.\n\n381\n00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.660\nWhen it says credentials, you can enter\nyour credentials in the commandlet that\n\n382\n00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.570\nyou're gonna run like we've just seen.\n\n383\n00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.870\nPersonally, like I said,\nI like to have the variable there so\n\n384\n00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.270\nif I'm having to set my credentials\nmultiple times in a PowerShell interface,\n\n385\n00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.450\nI don't have to sit there and\nre-type the credential over and over and\n\n386\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.060\nover cuz according to\nWes's administration,\n\n387\n00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.330\njust the password typing could add\nanother four hours to my configurations.\n\n388\n00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.098\nIt really should've just\nlasted five minutes.\n\n389\n00:22:17.098 --> 00:22:19.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n390\n00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.240\nNow like we've shown you, in, for\ninstance, in the Exchange episode, and\n\n391\n00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.140\nif you haven't seen that go back and\nwatch, there are certain commandlets that\n\n392\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.190\naren't built in to your Windows Powershell\nthat is stored locally on your machine.\n\n393\n00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.550\nSo if you want to test whether\nyou've connected to a service,\n\n394\n00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.620\nis trying one of the commandlets that's\nonly native to that environment and\n\n395\n00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.500\nnot native to the Windows\npower shell environment.\n\n396\n00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.050\nSo, if I wanted to,\n\n397\n00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:45.020\nI could test this out by doing a get\ndash SPO for share point online.\n\n398\n00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.470\nAnd then just type site.\n\n399\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.410\nAll right, and what it does is,\nnotice that it gives me the output.\n\n400\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:55.740\nWhat we're seeing here, notice all the\nSharePoint sites, this is the same thing,\n\n401\n00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.800\nwhat we see here in the graphical\nuser interface, this list right here.\n\n402\n00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.970\nAnd I'm connected in the GUI,\nwe know that.\n\n403\n00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.370\nBut if I look at PowerShell\nhere I'm seeing the same thing.\n\n404\n00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.980\nI'm seeing the same list of sites so\n\n405\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.290\nI can tell that I am\nconnected through PowerShell.\n\n406\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.300\nTo my SharePoint online\nmanagement interface.\n\n407\n00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.150\nNow here's where it gets a little tricky\nguys, because the next one we're gonna do,\n\n408\n00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.290\nlike I said, I caution you in the fact\nthat this should be a private computer\n\n409\n00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.810\nthat you're gonna be running.\n\n410\n00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.140\nYou really don't wanna be doing this,\nof course, on any public computer,\n\n411\n00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.780\nreally don't wanna be doing any\nof the administration anyways.\n\n412\n00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.450\nSo what we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna do the Set SPOTenant.\n\n413\n00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:38.850\nOh, and let me remember my PowerShell\nsyntax, you've gotta put a dash in there.\n\n414\n00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:43.080\nSPOTenant, all right, and\nare you ready for this one Mike?\n\n415\n00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.610\n>> I am.\n\n416\n00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.970\n>> All right, thank goodness for\nthat tab functionality, right?\n\n417\n00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:53.380\nSo that tab functionality, you can see\nthis is quite the parameter here guys.\n\n418\n00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.028\nUse it.\n\n419\n00:23:54.028 --> 00:23:58.446\nUse the tab functionality but\nI would remember that crazy parameter for\n\n420\n00:23:58.446 --> 00:24:02.567\nthe exam And what this is gonna do\nis you're gonna store persistent\n\n421\n00:24:02.567 --> 00:24:06.780\ncookie inside of the browser and\nhopefully solve that issue for us.\n\n422\n00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:11.340\nNow the next thing that I have to do\nis I have to make sure that I set\n\n423\n00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.210\nthe true variable at the end.\n\n424\n00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.680\nAnd then run this.\n\n425\n00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:22.330\nNow the next time I go back to\nmy graphical user interface and\n\n426\n00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.129\nI visit my team site again.\n\n427\n00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.220\nOh, and you know what, I've got that\nalready pulled up in the background.\n\n428\n00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.290\nWe don't have to relaunch that.\n\n429\n00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:36.205\nNow, I could go again to Documents or\nI could go to One Note.\n\n430\n00:24:36.205 --> 00:24:38.260\n[LAUGH] We'll get there eventually.\n\n431\n00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:43.260\nI'm going to try this one here\ncuz we were just at there.\n\n432\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.460\nOh, request access, oh, look at this.\n\n433\n00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.450\nI don't even have access\nto my own team sites.\n\n434\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.570\nGotta love that.\n\n435\n00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.060\nWell, that was another site here.\n\n436\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.220\nSo documents here,\nback to the same location.\n\n437\n00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.780\nWe're gonna go to library again.\n\n438\n00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.030\nRemember we're gonna\nchoose Open with Explorer.\n\n439\n00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.090\nNow here's the little warning.\n\n440\n00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.810\nOnce you set that persistent cookie,\nthey warn you about this.\n\n441\n00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.820\nThey say, and\nyou can see this, right guys?\n\n442\n00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.240\nYou should only use Open\nwith Internet Explorer,\n\n443\n00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.690\nor With Explorer on computers\nthat are private and trusted.\n\n444\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:22.040\nCuz your data's gonna be exposed\nuntil you sign out of Windows.\n\n445\n00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.430\nSo be very careful with this one, but\n\n446\n00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:27.050\nit's one of the other things that\ncould help you solve this problem.\n\n447\n00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.680\nI've got a couple errors, or warnings,\nabout my trial subscription here.\n\n448\n00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.620\nI'm gonna cancel this.\n\n449\n00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.960\nNow what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna go,\nand I'm gonna change this.\n\n450\n00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.010\n>> All right, I'm gonna set that\nvariable at the end to false, and\n\n451\n00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.420\nI don't like persistent cookies.\n\n452\n00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.890\nThey, definitely,\na security vulnerability there.\n\n453\n00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:46.870\nSo, Mike,\nwhen it comes to open with Explorer,\n\n454\n00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.070\nit's not very difficult\nto troubleshoot it.\n\n455\n00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.740\nNow, like I said,\nthe PowerShell Commandlets,\n\n456\n00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.540\nthey look a little intimidating at first,\nbut If you play video games, and how many\n\n457\n00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.870\ntimes have you had to play a video game, a\nlevel, over and over and over, absolutely\n\n458\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:05.350\nenjoying it to maybe some extent, not\nenjoying it, to try to beat that level?\n\n459\n00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.510\nDo the same thing with\nthe Powershell comandlet.\n\n460\n00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.820\nFour or five times,\nyou're gonna have it memorized and\n\n461\n00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.720\nyou'll be good to go for the exam.\n\n462\n00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.150\n>> All right now Wes, there's a couple\nother things we've gotta worry about.\n\n463\n00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.400\nJust like we do if we're\nworking with files locally,\n\n464\n00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.860\nwe've got somethings that we can't do\nwith files up there in the cloud, right?\n\n465\n00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.810\n>> That's right, and one of the things\nthat they definitely call out is if you're\n\n466\n00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.280\nhaving synchronization issues\nbetween SharePoint libraries and\n\n467\n00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:30.020\nOneDrive is to pay attention to things\nlike invalid characters, forward slashes,\n\n468\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.720\nback slashes, asterisks,\nquestion marks, percents.\n\n469\n00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.010\nA lot of these character restrictions\nthat you've seen in other\n\n470\n00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.430\ntechnologies out there.\n\n471\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.470\nThis is gonna be really\nthe same thing here, too.\n\n472\n00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.770\nAlso wanna talk real quick\njust about character limit.\n\n473\n00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.920\nThere are some character limitations,\nas far as the names of files.\n\n474\n00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.540\nYou'll see in SharePoint, and we're gonna\nkinda blur the line here because people\n\n475\n00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:56.000\ncould have a hybrid deployment, where they\nhave a SharePoint 2013 server on premise.\n\n476\n00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.290\nNow it's a little bit different\nbetween them and SharePoint online.\n\n477\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:03.770\nIf it's the server 2013,\nfiles are limited to 128 characters.\n\n478\n00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:08.770\nIf it's SharePoint online,\nthey're limited to 256 characters.\n\n479\n00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.440\nNow folders believe it or not,\n\n480\n00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.060\nthey have a little bit different\nof a character limitation.\n\n481\n00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:17.180\nFolders can have 250\ncharacters in their names.\n\n482\n00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.630\nThere are some invalid extensions, right?\n\n483\n00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.270\nI can't use .tmp.\n\n484\n00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.600\nThose are temporary files.\n\n485\n00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.300\nThe other one I can't use is a .ds_store.\n\n486\n00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:31.090\nWhen it comes to synchronization you\nhave a maximum of 20,000 files that\n\n487\n00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:35.640\nyou can synchronize,\n5,000 per site in any SharePoint library.\n\n488\n00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.160\nSo just know that there are some\nrestrictions, character limitation and\n\n489\n00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.840\nfile character limit as well, how many\ncharacters you can have in a file name.\n\n490\n00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.612\n>> Fantastic.\n\n491\n00:27:44.612 --> 00:27:47.320\nAll right a lot of great information\nthat's going to help me pass that exam as\n\n492\n00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.210\nwell as use these services out there in\nthe real world and support our end users,\n\n493\n00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.710\nwhich is what our end goal really is,\nright?\n\n494\n00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.140\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n495\n00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.100\nOne of the final things\nthat I might mention too,\n\n496\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:03.060\nis how you can recover deleted files and\nthat is the OneDrive recycle bin.\n\n497\n00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.370\nThe great thing is that when\nyou're using OneDrive, you know,\n\n498\n00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.880\nand you've got your OneDrive for\nbusiness app, and you delete it\n\n499\n00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.190\nfrom the OneDrive business app, it goes\nto the recycle bin on your computer.\n\n500\n00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.080\nBut the admins.\n\n501\n00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.520\nThey also have a recycle bin.\n\n502\n00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.540\nSo you get that get out of jail free card.\n\n503\n00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.940\n>> And let me show you where that is too.\n\n504\n00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.960\nCuz they do call that out.\n\n505\n00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.820\nSo, I'm here in OneDrive for business and,\n\n506\n00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.660\nover here on the left-hand side,\nthere is the recycle bin dashboard.\n\n507\n00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.280\nIf you delete any of these files from\nthe the OneDrive for Business apps.\n\n508\n00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.700\nIf they're doing this in file explorer\non their local machines, yeah.\n\n509\n00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.550\nIt goes to the Recycle Bin\non their machine.\n\n510\n00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.040\nBut even if they delete it from\nthe Recycle Bin on their machine,\n\n511\n00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.640\nyour admins still have the ability to\ncome here and at least have kind of like\n\n512\n00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.260\nthat last safety mechanism, to make sure\nthat if you are deleting business files\n\n513\n00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.560\nit'll be the admin that could either\nrestore them or do a final delete on them.\n\n514\n00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.940\nBut be careful, because if you delete them\nfrom from here, they are gonna be gone.\n\n515\n00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:57.840\n>> Gone forever.\n\n516\n00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.360\n>> That's right.\n\n517\n00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.360\n>> All right,\nwords to live by from Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n518\n00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.255\nAll right, we appreciate that Wes,\na lot of great demonstrations again.\n\n519\n00:29:04.255 --> 00:29:05.515\nA lot of great information.\n\n520\n00:29:05.515 --> 00:29:07.585\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n521\n00:29:07.585 --> 00:29:09.055\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n522\n00:29:09.055 --> 00:29:10.155\n>> And I'm West Bryan.\n\n523\n00:29:10.155 --> 00:29:11.513\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n524\n00:29:11.513 --> 00:29:16.450\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:20.500\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, today we're\ndoing our MTA cloud fundamentals.\n\n4\n00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.540\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be looking at Skype for Business,\n\n5\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.270\nanother important part of our enterprise\nenvironment, something we use, and\n\n6\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.920\nsomething that we have to be able\nto support when things go wrong.\n\n7\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.120\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Mister Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.850\nHow's it going Wes?\n\n9\n00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.750\n>> Hey, it's going great, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.760\nThanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.850\nAs always, good to be here with ITProTV,\nand that's right.\n\n12\n00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.480\nWe're going to be look at\nsupporting Skype for Business.\n\n13\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.600\nThis is one of the last of the services\nthat we really have to look at.\n\n14\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.810\nThis is one of the ones that we use for\nvoice over IP communications and\n\n15\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.010\ncommunications are definitely going to\nbe important inside of our company.\n\n16\n00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.340\nSo this really could be one of those\nservices, out of all the services\n\n17\n00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.720\nthat we talk about, that could be one of\nthe major lifelines for your business.\n\n18\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.210\nSo it is important to know some\nof the things that you can do to\n\n19\n00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.400\nremedy the issues, and actually to even\nknow what potential issues might come up.\n\n20\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.040\nWho does it affect,\n\n21\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.670\nand then some of the things that\nwe can do to resolve those issues.\n\n22\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.160\nSo that's what we're gonna be looking at.\n\n23\n00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.965\nWe're gonna be looking at\nthe scope of the problem,\n\n24\n00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:23.950\nw're gonna be looking at the potential\ncauses and then we're gonna discuss some\n\n25\n00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.640\nof the things that you can see in\norder to fix those potential problems.\n\n26\n00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.310\nSo Mike, one of the first things\nthat we have to look at is well,\n\n27\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.060\nwhat is the software that\nis running on the machine?\n\n28\n00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.880\nWe have what is known as the Skype for\nBusiness client, right?\n\n29\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.860\nAnd that's what manages the communications\nbetween your local machine\n\n30\n00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.380\noutbound across the internet and\nconnects to Skype for Business online.\n\n31\n00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.960\nBut not only just the client, the client's\nrunning on the computer itself.\n\n32\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.010\nSo I also have to look at\nsome things that might,\n\n33\n00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.460\nit might just be directly related to\nthe computer configuration itself.\n\n34\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.480\nOne of the first things we have to look\nat is when it is a client issue, and\n\n35\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.910\nwhen I say client issue,\nlet me very specific here,\n\n36\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.990\nI'm talking about the Skype for\nBusiness client, right?\n\n37\n00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.140\nIt's running on the client workstation,\nso that can get a little twisty there.\n\n38\n00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.770\nBut I'm talking about the agent that\nmanages the communication between whatever\n\n39\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.220\nconference that you gonna be a part of,\nany kind of Voice over IP call that\n\n40\n00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.810\nyou might be a part of, it's important\nto understand some of the things there.\n\n41\n00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.765\nFirst thing, out of date client, right?\n\n42\n00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:21.420\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You've gotta keep the client software\n\n43\n00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.990\nup to date.\n\n44\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.310\nIt's important, right, as they add\nfunctionality, improve functionality,\n\n45\n00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.460\nfix known flaws, bugs with\nthe platform that might've been there\n\n46\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.460\nin the previous version of the client,\n\n47\n00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.660\nif you stick with an older client,\nyou're gonna get left behind.\n\n48\n00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.840\nAnd that could be one of the first\nthings that you need to do.\n\n49\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.700\n>> Really, like the same principle as\napplying all of your updates, right,\n\n50\n00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.380\njust making sure you've got the latest and\ngreatest version of that client.\n\n51\n00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.380\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n52\n00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.480\nI mean, it's no different than any other\nsoftware that you're gonna have, and\n\n53\n00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.860\nwe need to apply our updates.\n\n54\n00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.315\nThe other thing that they do call\nout is a missing operating system.\n\n55\n00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:59.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I looked at some\n\n56\n00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.090\nof the support documentation and well if\nyour operating system is missing, chances\n\n57\n00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.440\nare your client went with it, so [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n58\n00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.960\n>> If I'm missing an operating system,\n\n59\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.940\nI think I've got bigger issues than\ntroubleshooting Skype at this point.\n\n60\n00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.810\n>> Yeah, that is-\n>> That definitely is a potential problem\n\n61\n00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.930\n>> What, what happened to my\n\n62\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:15.770\noperating system?\n\n63\n00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.160\nWell, we left it in front of the You\nare Here sign in the mall, and\n\n64\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.208\nwe've never seen it again.\n\n65\n00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:23.850\n[LAUGH] So you know, if you have general\nproblems with the operating system itself,\n\n66\n00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.410\nif you think you have malware that might\nbe causing, for instance, executables,\n\n67\n00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.550\nI've seen malware before that locks\ndown all legitimate executables like\n\n68\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.280\ntask manager, computer management,\n\n69\n00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.520\nall these things that you use to\nadminister to the operating system.\n\n70\n00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.290\nAnd, who knows,\n\n71\n00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.720\nit might actually might be hindering the\ncommunication with the application itself.\n\n72\n00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.080\nThe other thing too, and\nthis really could be, Mike,\n\n73\n00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.470\nlumped into updating your client agents,\nthe agent that manages the communication,\n\n74\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.030\nand it could also be\nthe operating system too.\n\n75\n00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.220\nThese are things like protocol\nhotfixes and product updates, right?\n\n76\n00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.260\nWhich, like I said,\ncan kind of run hand in hand,\n\n77\n00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.030\nbut also remember things like\nhotfixes on your machines.\n\n78\n00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.210\nRight, when we talked about in a previous\nepisode, one of the things that we talked\n\n79\n00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.840\nabout is the fact that the earlier\nweb browsers, like for\n\n80\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.530\ninstance connecting into SharePoint,\naren't gonna be supported, and I mean\n\n81\n00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.540\nspecifically Internet Explorer seven,\neight, no actually eight, nine, and ten.\n\n82\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.232\nThere wasn't a nine that's right,\nseven, eight, and ten.\n\n83\n00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:16.776\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Got to get those numbers right.\n\n84\n00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:21.028\nWell you know there was a hotfix that you\ncould apply to allow you to connect and\n\n85\n00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:23.380\nperform a certain functionality.\n\n86\n00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.090\nWell it's really no different from when\nyou're talking down any hotfix that comes\n\n87\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.310\nout for the application or any hotfix that\nmight be bundled into Windows updates,\n\n88\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.220\nso keep your Windows updates up to date.\n\n89\n00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.200\nMake sure that you're updating\nthat client, it is important.\n\n90\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.930\nNow here are two subjects,\n\n91\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.230\npotential causes, that I would\ndefinitely pay attention for the exam.\n\n92\n00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.850\nSurely an outdated client\nwill be one of them.\n\n93\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.100\nHere's a big one, all right, so I'm\ngonna say an exam alert on this one, and\n\n94\n00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.320\nI'm gonna wear my old Johnny Carson hat.\n\n95\n00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.280\nJay, can I tell what's in the test?\n\n96\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.820\nNo, not really, but\nI can guarantee you this one might be, and\n\n97\n00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.680\nthat's clock synchronization.\n\n98\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.290\nAll right, remember that we're talking\nabout voice over IP communications.\n\n99\n00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.900\nThat is a time-sensitive delivery\nmechanism that it relies on, right?\n\n100\n00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.800\nSo if you have out of sync clocks,\nyou might not be connecting too.\n\n101\n00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.260\nNow the other one is\nthe cache credentials.\n\n102\n00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.670\nNow if you are logging\nin to a work station via\n\n103\n00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.060\nyour office, maybe you guys have\neverything in the cloud, right?\n\n104\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.530\nAnd you're using online\nMicrosoft accounts and\n\n105\n00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.150\nstuff that are attached\nto domain accounts, well,\n\n106\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.820\nif it caches their credentials, you might\nbe trying to log in as somebody else,\n\n107\n00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.050\nso you might want to clear the cache\ncredentials on the operating system.\n\n108\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.580\nNow one of the things that I didn't\nmention, I talked about potential causes,\n\n109\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.760\nright, but I didn't talk about the scope.\n\n110\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.460\nAll right, so if it is a client issue,\nwho is it going to affect?\n\n111\n00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.680\nMost likely this affects maybe a single\nuser, or a specific group of users, right?\n\n112\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.300\nAnd if it's a group of users, a lot of\ntimes it's like a small group of users\n\n113\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.260\nthat are sharing common configurations.\n\n114\n00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.130\nSo you have to pay attention to\nthose configurations as well.\n\n115\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.531\nBut just know that something like a client\nissue itself or the computer issue\n\n116\n00:06:08.531 --> 00:06:12.465\nis typically just going to be a single\nuser or a small group of users.\n\n117\n00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:13.785\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n118\n00:06:13.785 --> 00:06:17.745\n>> All right, so now they also call out\nsome other things that you need to be\n\n119\n00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:21.670\naware of, and that's\nthe authentication and provisioning.\n\n120\n00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.690\nNow you've seen me struggle with typing\na password throughout this series, so\n\n121\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.360\nyou can see that it's a commonality,\nright?\n\n122\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.530\nIt's no different than if\nyou're implementing things like\n\n123\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.330\npassword complexity, right?\n\n124\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.370\nAs passwords get more complex, they can\nget harder to type, believe me, I know.\n\n125\n00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.380\nSo the scope of this one usually\naffects a specific kind of user,\n\n126\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.000\nif it isn't just the incorrect\npassword being typed.\n\n127\n00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.030\nAnd that's, for instance,\nlike federated users.\n\n128\n00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.950\nOn the back end,\n\n129\n00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.450\nsometimes what we don't see is the fact\nthat Active Directory Federation Services\n\n130\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.550\nis running to help us\nimplement that single sign-on.\n\n131\n00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.710\nRight, so I can enter my credentials, and\nI can go through the different platforms,\n\n132\n00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.290\nand I don't have to\nre-enter my credentials.\n\n133\n00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.390\nWell if the Active Directory Federation\n\n134\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.385\nServices Service-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n135\n00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:11.550\n>> Isn't working appropriately,\n\n136\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.380\nthen you might not get that federated\nauthentication or that single sign in, and\n\n137\n00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.920\nthat might be something\nthat you need to check.\n\n138\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.160\nAlong with the incorrect password,\n\n139\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.890\nis somebody not typing in their user\nemail, right, the sign-in email.\n\n140\n00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.490\nThat's we use that, what is it?\n\n141\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.540\nThe universal principle maybe,\nUPN, to log in.\n\n142\n00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.370\nWell if that name isn't typed correctly,\n\n143\n00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.190\njust like a password,\nit might cause problems with that as well.\n\n144\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.060\nNow we said specific type of users, right.\n\n145\n00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.760\nOne of them was any federated user.\n\n146\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.040\nThe other one would be one that\nisn't licensed to use Skype, right?\n\n147\n00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.695\nSo if you have something like this you\nhave to check your licensing information.\n\n148\n00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:56.914\nRemember, we've also talked in previous\nepisodes about license exhaustion,\n\n149\n00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.380\nso definitely pay attention to that.\n\n150\n00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.105\nAll right, now other issues\nthat we might have, Skyping and\n\n151\n00:08:02.105 --> 00:08:04.731\nonline service networking\nissues have to come into play.\n\n152\n00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:06.350\n>> Oh, definitely, definitely.\n\n153\n00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.090\nAnd when it comes to the networking\nissues, we gotta pretty good episode\n\n154\n00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.138\ntalking about some of the networking\nproblems that would come about, and some\n\n155\n00:08:14.138 --> 00:08:18.390\nof the utilities that you can use in order\nto check basic network communications.\n\n156\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.126\nNow with the networking communications,\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n157\n00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:24.260\ntackle the scope first, right.\n\n158\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.317\nWith the networking issues a lot of times\nwhich you'll see it affects a large\n\n159\n00:08:27.317 --> 00:08:28.050\ngroup of people.\n\n160\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.814\nRight, if it's a network communication\nissue and it's maybe not even, we're not\n\n161\n00:08:31.814 --> 00:08:35.430\nblaming Microsoft either, we're just\nsaying maybe even in your local subnet.\n\n162\n00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.830\nYou might see that this\nis geographical centric,\n\n163\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.280\nright, to a certain geographical region or\nlocation or.\n\n164\n00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.680\nEven more so, even affecting somebody.\n\n165\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.950\nNow, on the support documentation,\nthey say, in a specific domain.\n\n166\n00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.350\nThink about your tenet.\n\n167\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.989\nRight?\nIt could be affecting everybody in that\n\n168\n00:08:52.989 --> 00:08:54.000\ntenet itself.\n\n169\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.790\nSo it could be related\nto a specific domain.\n\n170\n00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.600\nNow what are some of the potential causes?\n\n171\n00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.030\nI wanna talk about the DNS auto discovery.\n\n172\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.401\nIf you are letting Microsoft\nmanage your DNS, and\n\n173\n00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:12.604\nwe showed you how you can set\nup your domain, for instance,\n\n174\n00:09:12.604 --> 00:09:16.890\nto put those NS records in the zone file,\nin DNS.\n\n175\n00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.263\nAnd basically what you're doing is\nputting those name server records,\n\n176\n00:09:21.263 --> 00:09:24.590\nyou're saying Microsoft,\nyou manage my DNS.\n\n177\n00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.540\nI don't wanna manage it, I'll put my name\nserver records in my DNS zone file and\n\n178\n00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.720\nthen what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna point back to you and\n\n179\n00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.150\nyou'll take care of that.\n\n180\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.560\nIf you set that up,\nautodiscovery should work.\n\n181\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.450\nHowever, It's when you choose\na customized domain right.\n\n182\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.940\nI want to use spacerooster.net right,\nwell I've got a host to DNS service, and\n\n183\n00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.540\nif I don't have the sip records,\n\n184\n00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.800\nthe SRV records the connonitical\nrecords that need to be in there And\n\n185\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.330\nthe A records then the problem is\nthe DNS auto discovery's gonna fail.\n\n186\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:59.890\nSo check your DNS records\ninside of your zone file if\n\n187\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.740\nyou're using your own hosted DNS service\nor you're using a customized domain and\n\n188\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.300\nyou're not offloading that\nname resolution to Microsoft.\n\n189\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.100\nThe other thing, network communications.\n\n190\n00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.800\nWe've also talked about this\nin other episodes, proxies.\n\n191\n00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.018\nRight, if you got a heavily\ninternally managed corporation,\n\n192\n00:10:17.018 --> 00:10:20.174\ngot some kind of contact type\nsecurity policy that says, no,\n\n193\n00:10:20.174 --> 00:10:24.667\nyou don't give your users direct access to\nthe Internet, they're gonna be redirected\n\n194\n00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:27.850\nthrough a proxy, then you have\nto check your proxy settings.\n\n195\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.660\nThe proxy settings might\nbe causing the problem.\n\n196\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:35.120\nThe other one comes back to\nthe commonality here as well.\n\n197\n00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.860\nAnd that's the firewall issue.\n\n198\n00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.000\nRight?\nDo you have an exception?\n\n199\n00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.030\nAre you blocking certain ports?\n\n200\n00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.600\nAre you blocking the communication?\n\n201\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.580\nSo, you also have to\ncheck the firewall too.\n\n202\n00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.380\nJust keep in mind that\nthis usually affects\n\n203\n00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.710\na large group of people this isn't\nrestricted it's just a single user.\n\n204\n00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.680\n>> Right, if it's a firewall issue every\nuser that's using that is going to\n\n205\n00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.940\nmost likely encounter that error.\n\n206\n00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.570\n>> Definitely, definitely.\n\n207\n00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.630\nNow we've talked about some\nof the things that very well\n\n208\n00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.350\nmight not be Microsoft at all, right?\n\n209\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.120\nMost of what we've talked about client\nissues right, configuration issues,\n\n210\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.290\ncomputer issues, network problems right.\n\n211\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.460\nThe last one that we wanna kinda touch\nbase on is something that could be related\n\n212\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.100\nto Microsoft right, and\nthat's service related issues.\n\n213\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.120\nNow service related issues\nare usually tenant wide, right.\n\n214\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.940\nIf my company is using Skype,\n\n215\n00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:29.960\nif my company using Active Directory,\nAzure Active Directory right, and\n\n216\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.360\nsomething goes wrong with those services,\nit affects everybody of my tenants.\n\n217\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.340\nSo service related issues there,\nyou can go to the service center,\n\n218\n00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.210\nrather the service health center dashboard\ninside Office 365 and you can look and\n\n219\n00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:48.470\nsee if the services are available, if\nthey've been given diminished experience.\n\n220\n00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.800\nRemember, that's all part of your SLA,\ntoo.\n\n221\n00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.271\nThe other thing that can happen too when\nthere's service related telltale sign is\n\n222\n00:11:55.271 --> 00:12:00.001\nthat it's site specific or, for instance,\na certain geographical location usually\n\n223\n00:12:00.001 --> 00:12:04.470\ndivided up by region, like for instance we\nmight would work here in North American\n\n224\n00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.010\nregion, that's where all\nof our data centers are.\n\n225\n00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.860\nAnd of it's specific to the North American\nregion then what I can do is\n\n226\n00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.870\nfind the data centers up on\nMicrosoft's support site and\n\n227\n00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.960\nfind out that maybe the one out there\nin Washington is a having issues.\n\n228\n00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.770\nAnd maybe that's where\nSkype is being held.\n\n229\n00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.910\nKeep in mind that not every data\ncenter holds every single service.\n\n230\n00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.220\nIn fact, we've seen that it's really,\nreally diverse, and\n\n231\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.150\nthe fact that one data center\ncould be holding just Yammer.\n\n232\n00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.450\nJust the Yammer service.\n\n233\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.970\nOr, this data center could be\nholding just the Skype service, and\n\n234\n00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.790\nthen you have other ones\nthat are combinations, but\n\n235\n00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:42.660\nthere is no guarantee that every single\ndata center's gonna be holding redundant\n\n236\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.380\nservices there, so it might be\nsomething that's located, for instance,\n\n237\n00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.040\nto a specific Skype server itself,\nthat might be having problems.\n\n238\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.854\nBut just keep in mind that when it\ncomes to service related issues,\n\n239\n00:12:53.854 --> 00:12:57.140\nthey, typically, are going to affect\neverybody within the tenant itself.\n\n240\n00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.260\n>> All right, so other issues\nwe've gotta deal with with Skype.\n\n241\n00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.370\nYou know, we think of Skype as using it\ninternally for business communications.\n\n242\n00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.590\nSometimes we need to communicate\nwith other tenants, right?\n\n243\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.270\nThey've got their own Skype set up, and\n\n244\n00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.910\nnow we've got to troubleshoot\nconnectivity between the two.\n\n245\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.821\n>> That's right.\nSo, when it comes to this topic,\n\n246\n00:13:13.821 --> 00:13:16.702\nI would tell you, start with\nnormal communication problems, and\n\n247\n00:13:16.702 --> 00:13:20.356\nsome of the other one's we've looked at,\nyou know, because if you can't sign in,\n\n248\n00:13:20.356 --> 00:13:23.920\nright, that really doesn't have to do a,\ncommunicating with another company.\n\n249\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.704\nSo, look at basic network connections,\n\n250\n00:13:26.704 --> 00:13:29.890\nyour basic network\ntroubleshooting process.\n\n251\n00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:34.820\nAnd eliminate those first before we figure\nout has there been a misconfiguration.\n\n252\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.410\nAnd that's what this\nreally could boil down to.\n\n253\n00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.400\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n254\n00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.550\nWe've got the SharePoint admin center\npulled up, SharePoint admin center,\n\n255\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.051\nwe got the wrong interface pulled up.\n\n256\n00:13:45.051 --> 00:13:47.167\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm actually in the Skype for Business.\n\n257\n00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:49.836\nYou don't troubleshoot Skype for\nBusiness in SharePoint here.\n\n258\n00:13:49.836 --> 00:13:50.750\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n259\n00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.240\n>> So we've got this Skype for\n\n260\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.330\nBusiness admin console pulled up here and\n\n261\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.530\none of the things we'll run\nthe main dashboard here.\n\n262\n00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:02.520\nIf I go over to this organization\ndashboard and we switch it over to that.\n\n263\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:08.330\nThis is where I can control external\ncommunications, right there.\n\n264\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:13.810\nAnd this is s setting that might be\nmisconfigured or maybe it isn't turned on.\n\n265\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.454\nLet me show you what I mean,\nbecause by default,\n\n266\n00:14:16.454 --> 00:14:20.969\none of things that you're gonna notice is\nthat, notice it says let people use Skype\n\n267\n00:14:20.969 --> 00:14:25.180\nfor Business to communicate with Skype\nusers outside of your organization.\n\n268\n00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.546\nAnd notice that check mark or\nthe check box, it's blank, so\n\n269\n00:14:28.546 --> 00:14:30.535\nby default you have to turn this on.\n\n270\n00:14:30.535 --> 00:14:34.851\nYou have to enable it first before\nanybody is gonna be able to use this\n\n271\n00:14:34.851 --> 00:14:39.105\nfunctionality and that might be\njust a simple oversight, right?\n\n272\n00:14:39.105 --> 00:14:44.112\nBut it might be a little bit more\na little bit more than that.\n\n273\n00:14:44.112 --> 00:14:46.662\nAll right?\nSo we can do this through whitelisting or\n\n274\n00:14:46.662 --> 00:14:48.062\nwe can do this through blacklisting.\n\n275\n00:14:48.062 --> 00:14:48.980\nRight?\nI can say,\n\n276\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:54.522\nI want to allow everybody to communicate\nexcept for these blocked domains.\n\n277\n00:14:54.522 --> 00:14:57.080\nAnd by the way, that's the default.\n\n278\n00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.540\nAnd the blocked domains you might say,\nwell wait a second,\n\n279\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.870\nwhy would they set that as the default?\n\n280\n00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.890\nIt's cuz the list is empty, right?\n\n281\n00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.280\nYou aren't blocking any domains.\n\n282\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.674\nAnd how you choose to set this up is\nreally gonna be what's relevant for\n\n283\n00:15:09.674 --> 00:15:10.975\nyour environment.\n\n284\n00:15:10.975 --> 00:15:14.120\nLike for\ninstance we could go white listing right?\n\n285\n00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.360\nAnd I could say only, or\nuse this only for allowed domains.\n\n286\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.870\nSo for instance, maybe we make toys,\nmy company does, and maybe Mike's\n\n287\n00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:29.140\ntenant right, he's a third party vendor\nthat makes parts that we heavily rely on.\n\n288\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:34.690\nWell I might say, for Toys.com,\nwe'll let people communicate internally,\n\n289\n00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.840\nbut I'm gonna put an allowed\ndomain here that's parch.com and\n\n290\n00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.740\nthat only communicates between Mike and\n\n291\n00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.540\nmy company because maybe that's\nthe only external communication I want.\n\n292\n00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.786\nSo how you set it up is really contingent\non how many different external\n\n293\n00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:50.059\ncommunications you have.\n\n294\n00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:54.620\nIf you know that your users are gonna be\nusing a lot of different organizations\n\n295\n00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.140\nare communicating with a lot\nof different organizations.\n\n296\n00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.634\nYou might want to just say\nthe blocked list and leave it empty.\n\n297\n00:16:01.634 --> 00:16:05.488\nHowever, if it's only maybe a couple\nof these external companies that you\n\n298\n00:16:05.488 --> 00:16:09.342\nwanna communicate with, then you might\ndo something like the principle of\n\n299\n00:16:09.342 --> 00:16:13.501\nleast privilege and put those companies,\nthose couple of companies there, and\n\n300\n00:16:13.501 --> 00:16:17.550\nthen you don't have to worry about\nit going outside of those bounds.\n\n301\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.530\nSo fairly easy and then we could do,\nagain, if it's blocked or\n\n302\n00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.110\nallowed domains, it depends.\n\n303\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.742\nYou can add the domains here so\nI could say here,\n\n304\n00:16:24.742 --> 00:16:30.320\nspacerooster.net, right.\n\n305\n00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.110\nAnd I could add that.\n\n306\n00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.222\nNow when I add that,\nit really is gonna be,\n\n307\n00:16:36.222 --> 00:16:40.920\ndo I want this to be the block domain,\nright?\n\n308\n00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.740\nNotice that it leaves it there,\nbut it just,\n\n309\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.550\nall I'm doing is changing the setting.\n\n310\n00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.400\nSo when you put your domains there,\nyou can populate this domain list, but\n\n311\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.630\nbe careful because based on the selection\nthat you choose, it's gonna say\n\n312\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.130\nwhether it's gonna be a blocked\ncommunication or an allowed communication.\n\n313\n00:16:55.130 --> 00:17:00.950\nAnd again, the default is blocked\ndomains with an empty list.\n\n314\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:01.830\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n315\n00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.810\nAnd also for this exam,\nI know I keep saying this.\n\n316\n00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.490\nBecause I mean, it's really exam focused.\n\n317\n00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.150\nKnow that this isn't enabled by default.\n\n318\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.470\nSo it could, like I said, just be an\noversight on the admin's part that said,\n\n319\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.960\noh, I forgot to go in there and\njust enable that.\n\n320\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.320\nAnd it might show up there on the exam.\n\n321\n00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.710\n>> Could be something that my\norganization is doing intentionally.\n\n322\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:27.470\nMy users are trying to set up a Skype call\nwith somebody from another organization,\n\n323\n00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.560\nlike why isn't this working?\n\n324\n00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.110\nWell, it's not working on purpose, right?\n\n325\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.530\nWe don't want you using Skype for\nout of business communication.\n\n326\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.252\nSo it could be something\nas simple as that.\n\n327\n00:17:36.252 --> 00:17:37.389\n>> Yep, definitely.\n\n328\n00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:39.906\n>> Or it could be that they haven't\nturned it on or forgot to turn it on.\n\n329\n00:17:39.906 --> 00:17:41.350\n>> Yeah, and like we've been mentioning,\n\n330\n00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.420\nthings like security policies as\nwell could be the issue that's here.\n\n331\n00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.710\nMaybe your company, like Mike said,\ndoesn't want the communications to happen.\n\n332\n00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.960\nNow one of the last things I'd like\nto mention are some of the utilities\n\n333\n00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.080\nthat you have, the troubleshoot Skype.\n\n334\n00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.740\nAnd on the Skype for\nBusiness admin center page,\n\n335\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.180\nyou'll see that we have this tools\ndashboard here, tools option down here.\n\n336\n00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:08.500\nAnd the one that I'm really,\nreally concerned with and I wanna show you\n\n337\n00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.270\nis the troubleshoot Skype for Business\nonline sign-in for administrators.\n\n338\n00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.650\nThis right here is the Skype for\n\n339\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:18.260\nBusiness Connectivity Analyzer, be careful\nwith the documentation on this one, guys.\n\n340\n00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.670\nDon't let this confuse you.\n\n341\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.610\nBefore Microsoft bought our Skype,\n\n342\n00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.060\ntheir internal communication\nservers were called Lync.\n\n343\n00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.980\nSo, when you go to Microsoft's website,\nTechNet, and\n\n344\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.150\nyou download this\nConnectivity Analyzer tool,\n\n345\n00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:35.460\nit will still be called\nthe Lync Connectivity Analyzer tool.\n\n346\n00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.820\nIt's the same utility, right?\n\n347\n00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.760\nWhen Microsoft bought out Skype,\nthey renamed Lync, Skype for Business.\n\n348\n00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.600\nSo, it's the same utility that you\nwould use if it was called Lync, or\n\n349\n00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.970\nwhether it's called Skype, there really\nis no problem there with the name itself.\n\n350\n00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.887\nBut let's go ahead and\nlet's go to this one, right here.\n\n351\n00:18:53.887 --> 00:18:55.980\nLet's go to the troubleshooting Skype for\nBusiness Online.\n\n352\n00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.260\nAnd this is a really cool thing, it's\na really cool support feature for admins,\n\n353\n00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.650\nin the fact that, and here we get to see,\nyou get to see that fact, right?\n\n354\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.160\nSo we're in Skype for Business,\nand they call it Lync.\n\n355\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.190\nLike I said guys, you'll probably see\nhere, within the next year or so, but\n\n356\n00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.720\nthe documentation will be updated.\n\n357\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.860\nIt's really just a copy, cut, and\npaste because all of the documentation for\n\n358\n00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.740\nthings like Lync are also gonna be\nbeneficial to Skype itself too.\n\n359\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.940\nSo they're not reinventing the wheel here.\n\n360\n00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.410\nNow who is this for?\n\n361\n00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:26.350\nAll right, Office 365 admins.\n\n362\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.080\nThey make it kind of clear, all right.\n\n363\n00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.330\nNow, what are they gonna do?\n\n364\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.080\nWe're gonna do a little\ntroubleshooting process.\n\n365\n00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.712\nThey're gonna do\nthe troubleshooting process.\n\n366\n00:19:32.712 --> 00:19:35.960\nThey're gonna ask the questions, and\nall we have to do is answer them.\n\n367\n00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.410\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna choose start here.\n\n368\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.170\nAnd notice that it's got a few options.\n\n369\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:44.560\nOne user or a few users here and there,\neverybody in a specific group or\n\n370\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.530\na single location, or\neverybody in my organization.\n\n371\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:51.240\nAll right, Mike, A, B, C, or\nD, you want behind which door?\n\n372\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.630\n>> Oh, let's go with A.\n\n373\n00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.550\n>> A, okay, so one user or\na few users here and there.\n\n374\n00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.420\nSo we'll go ahead and select this one.\n\n375\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.630\nAll right, and\ncan the affected users sign in?\n\n376\n00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:02.400\nYes or no, Mike?\n\n377\n00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.060\n>> Yes, they can.\n\n378\n00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.160\n>> Yes, they can, all right.\n\n379\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.080\nNow one of the things that they're telling\nyou is, pay attention, does the user have\n\n380\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.260\na valid, and that is Skype for Business,\neven though it says Lync, license?\n\n381\n00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.520\nAnd you'll see here,\n\n382\n00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.460\nthey even give you the steps to go in and\nfix the problem too, so.\n\n383\n00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.723\nNot only just those open ended questions,\nwe're gonna move through\n\n384\n00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:26.790\nthe troubleshooting process, but then it's\ngonna hopefully lead to a resolution.\n\n385\n00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.590\nAnd it's up to you to dictate\nwhether did that solve the problem.\n\n386\n00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.730\nMike, did that solve our problem or no?\n\n387\n00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.560\n>> It did, indeed.\n\n388\n00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.850\n>> Okay, it solved our problem,\nwe're good.\n\n389\n00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.310\nAnd look at that, congratulations.\n\n390\n00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.720\nMike has now resolved the issue\n\n391\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.690\nthrough the online connection\nutility that we have here.\n\n392\n00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.720\nSo really cool utility,\nreally good to have that support.\n\n393\n00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.750\nI don't have to ask\nthe questions of the end user.\n\n394\n00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.580\nWell, I guess I do.\n\n395\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.900\nI have to collect that information.\n\n396\n00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.700\nBut if you've got like a help desk\nstaff and you got a ticketing system,\n\n397\n00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.550\nthose questions might just come up to your\ndesk and all you have to do is fill them\n\n398\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:02.710\nin on the online web page here, and\nthen you can try to resolve the issues.\n\n399\n00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.860\n>> Fantastic, another great episode.\n\n400\n00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.560\nA lot of good information, a lot of\ngreat demos, Wes, we thank you for that.\n\n401\n00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.890\n>> Yeah.\n>> Really helping us understand\n\n402\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.705\nhow we can go about troubleshooting\nSkype for Business.\n\n403\n00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:14.425\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n404\n00:21:14.425 --> 00:21:15.944\nSigning off, I'm Mike

00:00:19.795\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, today we're\ndoing our MTA cloud fundamentals and\n\n4\n00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:23.159\nspecifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at some of\n\n5\n00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.052\nthe tools that we can use for\ntroubleshooting, right?\n\n6\n00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:30.204\nAnd we've seen most of these tools through\nout the other episodes kinda scattered\n\n7\n00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:34.236\nhere and there but in this episode we're\ngonna bring them all together and kinda\n\n8\n00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:38.597\ngive us a nice collection of all the tools\nwe've got available for troubleshooting.\n\n9\n00:00:38.597 --> 00:00:41.730\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nWes Bryan, how's it going, Wes?\n\n10\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.211\n>> It's going great and as always Mike,\n\n11\n00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:47.350\nit's good to be back here with ITProTV and\nthat's right, we're gonna be talking about\n\n12\n00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.010\nsome of the different tools that you can\nuse and where they're gonna be located at.\n\n13\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.246\nSometimes they're gonna be located\ndirectly in your operating system and\n\n14\n00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:57.375\nit isn't gonna be anything that you\nhave to add to the operating system or\n\n15\n00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:58.321\nto troubleshoot it.\n\n16\n00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:01.765\nThen again, some of them are gonna\nbe ones that you are gonna connect\n\n17\n00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:04.607\ndirectly to Microsoft there Mike and\nI say Microsoft but\n\n18\n00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:08.132\ndirectly to the Office platform\nitself in order to troubleshoot it.\n\n19\n00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:08.922\n>> Very good.\n\n20\n00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:11.627\nAll right, so why don't we start\nwe have a lot of tools to go over,\n\n21\n00:01:11.627 --> 00:01:14.795\nwhat we're gonna do, we'll follow\nour troubleshooting best practices.\n\n22\n00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:17.120\nWe'll start locally and\nwork for our way out, so\n\n23\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.831\nlet's look at some of the tools we would\nuse locally to start with our issues.\n\n24\n00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:24.520\n>> Hey, perfect that sounds good so\nwhen we start locally, right?\n\n25\n00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.040\nWe got to look a few services,\nquite few services\n\n26\n00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.790\nthat Office 365 relies on in order to\nmaintain and manage communications.\n\n27\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.400\nNow, before we do that take\nOffice 365 out of the equation.\n\n28\n00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.748\nA lot of times this troubleshooting\nmethods are gonna be use as well,\n\n29\n00:01:39.748 --> 00:01:41.709\na troubleshooting method, excuse me,\n\n30\n00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.650\nthe tools behind that to troubleshoot\nany kind of basic network communication.\n\n31\n00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.214\nSo this really isn't gonna differentiate\nto much between any other kind of network\n\n32\n00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:54.467\ncommunication and more specifically for\nus here, connecting to the cloud.\n\n33\n00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.642\nOne of the very first services that\nwe're gonna need to look at and\n\n34\n00:01:57.642 --> 00:02:00.850\nthe utilities behind it,\nis DNS the Domain Name System.\n\n35\n00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.640\nKeep in mind, if you're not familiar with\nwhat DNS is, it's just that hierarchical\n\n36\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.400\nname resolution service that allows us to\ntake fully qualified domain names, right?\n\n37\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.300\nYou type a user-friendly URL or a name in,\nand it maps it to its IP address.\n\n38\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.520\nWell, that's not only important for\njust basic network in our\n\n39\n00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.510\nInternet connectivity and\nbrowsing across the Internet,\n\n40\n00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.940\nit's also gonna be important to\nmaintain your services as well.\n\n41\n00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.400\nSo some of the utilities that we have are,\nwell, one that's been around for\n\n42\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.570\na while, and\nthat is the good old nslookup.\n\n43\n00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.080\nNow, I've gone ahead guys here and\nyou might say,\n\n44\n00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.070\nwell wait a second, I'm familiar with\nnslookup and nslookup you use in\n\n45\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.610\nthe traditional Windows command prompt,\nand I see you've got PowerShell here.\n\n46\n00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.850\nWell, something that I've learned and\nmaybe you might like to do this too.\n\n47\n00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.760\nSince you can implement any one of\nthe command prompt commands inside of\n\n48\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.630\na PowerShell,\nwhy launch up two interfaces anymore?\n\n49\n00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.460\nSo I've kinda made it a habit\nto launch up the PowerShell, and\n\n50\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.980\nthen if I need to I can always switch\nin and out of a command prompt and\n\n51\n00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.970\nI can exit back and you can see\nthe cursor, how it's changing there.\n\n52\n00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.337\nAnd I can use a combination of the both,\nso keep in mind that nslookup,\n\n53\n00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:13.120\nyes has been a traditional\nWindows command prompt command.\n\n54\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.501\nBut I'm gonna be executing it\ninside of the PowerShell, and\n\n55\n00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:19.495\nthat's kind of a handy feature\nthat you can do there.\n\n56\n00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:22.019\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So what is it that, when we say DNS,\n\n57\n00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.393\nwhat exactly are we gonna troubleshoot?\n\n58\n00:03:24.393 --> 00:03:28.691\nWell, we're gonna troubleshoot whether\nwe can resolve those names that we type\n\n59\n00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:29.396\nin, right?\n\n60\n00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:35.800\nFor instance, www.support.office.com.\n\n61\n00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.650\nIf I type in that name to a web browser,\ncan I connect to that website?\n\n62\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.560\nWell, this is what we see.\n\n63\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.880\nOn the front end as end users\nwe see that connection or\n\n64\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.910\nif that connection doesn't work.\n\n65\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.920\nBut what we don't see,\nis that under the hood,\n\n66\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.160\nthe engine that is Office 365\nrelies heavily on this service.\n\n67\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.030\nSo one of the first things\nI might wanna do is,\n\n68\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.410\ncan I resolve something\nlike Outlook.Office365.com?\n\n69\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.295\nBecause I wanna figure out,\ncan I connect to the website?\n\n70\n00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:09.073\nOr maybe even the computer,\nthat is hosting Outlook here and\n\n71\n00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:12.200\nkeep in mind here,\nwe're talking data centers.\n\n72\n00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.910\nIt's not just a specific computer,\nbut let's go ahead and see that.\n\n73\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.650\nWe'll type our nslookup and we're\ngonna type, what'd I say there, Mike?\n\n74\n00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.944\nOutlook.\n\n75\n00:04:21.944 --> 00:04:26.519\n>> Okay.\n>> .office365.com.\n\n76\n00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:30.442\nI'm gonna just throw it\nright off the screen there.\n\n77\n00:04:30.442 --> 00:04:37.820\n[LAUGH] Now what I can see is that I\nam receiving the results back here.\n\n78\n00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.710\nSo it's letting me know that hey,\nthat outlook.office365.com,\n\n79\n00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.050\neven though that's what I might type,\nnotice that the name is a little\n\n80\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.390\nbit different here, and this is because\nin the background if you're typing things\n\n81\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.350\nlike a website a lot of times those are\ngonna be what's known as canonical names.\n\n82\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.250\nThose C names, those records that we've\ntalked about in other episodes that\n\n83\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.040\nwe really rely on inside of Office 365,\nso it's letting me know first of all\n\n84\n00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.370\nthat outlook.office365.com that name is\nactually mapped to this computer here.\n\n85\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.809\nAnd you can see some of the other aliases\nright and again, it's a C name record.\n\n86\n00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:20.944\nIt just means, you type this, well here is\nthe actual computer that's hosting that.\n\n87\n00:05:20.944 --> 00:05:25.852\nWe can see, well, interestingly enough\na lot of IPv6 addresses that are being\n\n88\n00:05:25.852 --> 00:05:31.126\nmapped here too, so you can see Microsoft\nis definitely onboard of this using IPv6,\n\n89\n00:05:31.126 --> 00:05:32.900\nthe replacement for IPv4.\n\n90\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.415\nNow, I can also see that there's\nplenty of other IP addresses.\n\n91\n00:05:37.415 --> 00:05:41.415\nRemember that when we're talking about\nresolving a name, we might not be\n\n92\n00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:47.565\nresolving in connecting to via DNS to a\none specific site or one specific server.\n\n93\n00:05:47.565 --> 00:05:49.745\nThis is going to be doing\nthings like load balancing,\n\n94\n00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:54.260\nit's gonna be distributed across data\ncenters regional or around the world.\n\n95\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.880\nSo that's why we got these\nmultiple IP addresses here.\n\n96\n00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.160\nSo, one of the things that I can see\ngoing out the gate is that when I\n\n97\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.730\nuse the nslookup command.\n\n98\n00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.900\nMike, it looks like we have some name\nresolution going on, we've tested it and\n\n99\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.140\nit looks like it's successful.\n\n100\n00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.670\n>> Absolutely, it looks like you're\nable to return the IP address for\n\n101\n00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.242\nthat name you typed in, so\nthat's always a good start.\n\n102\n00:06:13.242 --> 00:06:15.770\n>> Yeah, and the other thing that\nmight happen, and this one is\n\n103\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.250\na little more rare just because when\nyou have these online services,\n\n104\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.310\na lot of times the IP\naddresses don't change.\n\n105\n00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.770\nWe talk about statically mapping IP\naddresses to servers and stuff like that,\n\n106\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.240\nbut you just never know if,\nmaybe, you've got a computer.\n\n107\n00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.602\nI don't know about you, in fact,\nI was thinking about this this morning,\n\n108\n00:06:32.602 --> 00:06:33.324\nI'm at the computer.\n\n109\n00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:35.356\nI don't know when the last time it\nwas that I did turn it off, right?\n\n110\n00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:39.222\nSo let's say I haven't turned\nmy computer off in six months.\n\n111\n00:06:39.222 --> 00:06:41.322\nWell, I could have a record, all right?\n\n112\n00:06:41.322 --> 00:06:44.696\nA DNS record when we do\nthe name resolution that is now\n\n113\n00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:47.697\nstored in my local DNS resolver cash,\nright?\n\n114\n00:06:47.697 --> 00:06:50.774\nAs part of the name resolution\nprocess that goes on, right?\n\n115\n00:06:50.774 --> 00:06:53.080\nI'm gonna look locally first.\n\n116\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.088\nWhy send a question out to a DNS server,\nwherever it resides and\n\n117\n00:06:58.088 --> 00:07:02.980\nsay, can you find\noutlook.office365.com for me?\n\n118\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.210\nWell, I'm gonna speed up the process,\nright?\n\n119\n00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.250\nWell my computer is, I should say,\nby using the local cache.\n\n120\n00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.726\nWell, if you haven't turned\nyour computer off, guess what?\n\n121\n00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:14.348\nThat cache is generated,\nis building up, right?\n\n122\n00:07:14.348 --> 00:07:18.220\nWe do this with DNS servers and in order\nto speed up the response times, but\n\n123\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.830\nyour computer's gonna do the same thing.\n\n124\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.890\nAnd if you haven't turned your\ncomputer off, you might have, or\n\n125\n00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.240\nwhat they call what I believe\nwhat's a stale record in there.\n\n126\n00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.100\nYou have a older record like I said,\n\n127\n00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.440\nthis doesn't happen too much with\nthese online services because again,\n\n128\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.350\nthey don't wanna change it too much or\nnobody would be able to connect.\n\n129\n00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:41.524\nSo if we wanted to display records here we\ncan actually do an ipconfig /displaydns.\n\n130\n00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.080\nAnd when I run this, it's gonna show\nme those records that are in the catch.\n\n131\n00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.327\nDid you catch that one, Mike?\n\n132\n00:07:48.327 --> 00:07:49.022\n>> I got all those.\n\n133\n00:07:49.022 --> 00:07:50.310\n>> You got all those?\n\n134\n00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.715\nOkay, [LAUGH] So, the records that you see\nhere are what we have resolved, right?\n\n135\n00:07:53.715 --> 00:07:57.253\nYou can see the record type A record\nmeans it's taking a host name, or\n\n136\n00:07:57.253 --> 00:08:00.924\nfull qualified domain, well a host\nname and making it to an IP address.\n\n137\n00:08:00.924 --> 00:08:05.146\nBut maybe I've got a specific record in\nhere that's causing a problem maybe the IP\n\n138\n00:08:05.146 --> 00:08:06.320\naddress has changed.\n\n139\n00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.450\nWell, the problem with that is,\nthose records are gonna do me no good.\n\n140\n00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.231\nAnd we can actually filter this down here.\n\n141\n00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:16.109\nAnd I'm gonna do this, the filter, cuz you\ncan also do this inside of PowerShell.\n\n142\n00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:22.563\nSo keep in mind to display the DNS cache,\nwe're gonna type ipconfig/displayDNS.\n\n143\n00:08:22.563 --> 00:08:27.378\nThere's also a command that\nallows you to do this too and\n\n144\n00:08:27.378 --> 00:08:30.563\nthat's the Get-DNSClientCache.\n\n145\n00:08:30.563 --> 00:08:32.757\nHow do you like that,\nI actually spelled that right.\n\n146\n00:08:32.757 --> 00:08:33.756\nDid you get all those?\n\n147\n00:08:33.756 --> 00:08:34.904\n>> Used tab, yeah, no.\n\n148\n00:08:34.904 --> 00:08:36.123\n>> And I didn't use tab.\n\n149\n00:08:36.123 --> 00:08:37.923\nYou missed the one, okay.\n\n150\n00:08:37.923 --> 00:08:42.316\nSo Mike, wasn't quick enough to get one of\nthose 400,000 records that we got here but\n\n151\n00:08:42.316 --> 00:08:43.798\nwe can make it a little easier.\n\n152\n00:08:43.798 --> 00:08:49.192\nMaybe I'm just looking for a specific\nrecord, so maybe I'm looking at,\n\n153\n00:08:49.192 --> 00:08:53.716\nI could put an asterisk here and\nI could do office, I believe,\n\n154\n00:08:53.716 --> 00:08:59.197\nthere's the portal is Office.365,\nif I could spell com, right?\n\n155\n00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:03.001\nDoesn't look like we have any in there,\nso let me give you an example.\n\n156\n00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.998\nI know Microsoft, there's one in here,\n\n157\n00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:08.174\nbecause my computer's probably\nin the middle of doing updates.\n\n158\n00:09:08.174 --> 00:09:10.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so you can see,\n\n159\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.600\nyou can find specific records here.\n\n160\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.450\nYou can find things like the TimeToLive,\nhow long those records are gonna be there.\n\n161\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.756\nSo that's the way to display the records.\n\n162\n00:09:19.756 --> 00:09:23.180\nBut, maybe I wanna the clear the records,\nMike,\n\n163\n00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.170\ndo you know a reason of why I\nmight wanna clear those records?\n\n164\n00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:31.470\n>> Well again, as you were saying earlier,\nyou might have a record that's incorrect.\n\n165\n00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.520\nIt might have been changed.\n\n166\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.332\nThey might have changed the IP\naddress on the machine.\n\n167\n00:09:36.332 --> 00:09:39.833\nAnd as you were saying, your computers\ngonna use that cache first cuz it's local,\n\n168\n00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:41.695\nit's the quickest way to resolve the name.\n\n169\n00:09:41.695 --> 00:09:43.440\nSo you might have to flush those out,\n\n170\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.875\nit's a troubleshooting\nmethod I use all the time.\n\n171\n00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:48.349\nLet's just eliminate any caches.\n\n172\n00:09:48.349 --> 00:09:52.475\nLet's just go ahead and go back to\nthe source and get the latest information.\n\n173\n00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:54.660\n>> Yeah, I mentioned and\nterm that I have to correct.\n\n174\n00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.020\nI know stale records,\nthat's not actually a correct term.\n\n175\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.320\nStale records are in your DNS zone file,\nthis is just like Mike said.\n\n176\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.310\nIt's just a record that's changed.\n\n177\n00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.020\nSo I just make sure that\nI correct that there.\n\n178\n00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.330\nSo if I wanna delete the cache,\nwe can do this through the command prompt,\n\n179\n00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.360\nwe can do ipconfig space forward slash,\nwe do flush dns.\n\n180\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:20.480\nAnd if we type flushdns that's\ngoing to clear that DNS cache.\n\n181\n00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.320\nAnd when I run this, notice that it says\n\n182\n00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.290\nsuccessfully flushed the DNS resolver\ncache which is a good thing to do here.\n\n183\n00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.820\nNow, let me go ahead and\ngenerate a little bit more.\n\n184\n00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:37.660\nI tell you what, let's show them\nwhat that actually did here.\n\n185\n00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.774\nIf it'll quit trying to pop up there.\n\n186\n00:10:39.774 --> 00:10:44.452\nWe're gonna do the ipconfig, and\n\n187\n00:10:44.452 --> 00:10:50.917\nwe're gonna do the /displaydns, all right.\n\n188\n00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:53.938\nNow I've got a couple of records here,\nthat you can\n\n189\n00:10:53.938 --> 00:10:58.660\nsee that's actually directly related to\nmy links that keeps popping up there.\n\n190\n00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.319\n>> So you've flushed it, it's already\ngot new cached entries in there.\n\n191\n00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:04.210\nCuz then your computer's not\nstopping just cuz you flushed it.\n\n192\n00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.600\nBut you flushed all the other stuff?\n\n193\n00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.120\n>> That's right.\n>> And\n\n194\n00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.620\nthose are newly resolved\nnames that are in there.\n\n195\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.660\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n196\n00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.750\n>> I was thinking of another reason too,\nyou might need to flush that cache, most\n\n197\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.530\nrecords have what we call a TTL with them,\nwhich means they have a Time To Live.\n\n198\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.020\nSo you're only gonna cache them,\nfor as long as that TTL.\n\n199\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:24.320\nIt's based in seconds, then it can\nbe anywhere from 60 to thousands.\n\n200\n00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.800\nBut once it gets down to zero,\n\n201\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.850\nyour computer automatically\nflushed that record.\n\n202\n00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.460\nIt'll have to go to resolve it again\nthat way, cuz we know things change.\n\n203\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.957\nDNS' very dynamic, so\nwe don't wanna keep those record forever.\n\n204\n00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:36.200\nBut there are some,\n\n205\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.309\nthe one that jumps out at me in\nparticular is the old name not found.\n\n206\n00:11:40.309 --> 00:11:45.100\nWhen if we try to resolve a name,\nlet's say we're having a DNS issue, and\n\n207\n00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.310\nIt can't resolve the name.\n\n208\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:52.120\nWell, actually caches that error, the fact\nthat this name does not exist, even\n\n209\n00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.430\nthough it really does exist, we're just\nhaving a DNS issue trying to resolve it.\n\n210\n00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.300\nIt'll end up caching that\nname doesn't exist entry for\n\n211\n00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.773\nwhatever name you typed in.\n\n212\n00:12:00.773 --> 00:12:03.369\nAnd because it never talked to DNS server,\n\n213\n00:12:03.369 --> 00:12:07.055\nnever resolved it into a resource record,\nthere's no TTL.\n\n214\n00:12:07.055 --> 00:12:10.804\nSo now that one will sit in there\nforever and even when you fix your\n\n215\n00:12:10.804 --> 00:12:15.140\nDNS issues your computer's not gonna\ntry to resolve the name again.\n\n216\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.210\nBecause it looks in it's cache and\n\n217\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.710\nsays I've already looked this up,\nthe name doesn't exist.\n\n218\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.470\nSo now you've gotta go flush that record\nout to force it to go back to DNS and\n\n219\n00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.060\ntry again.\n\n220\n00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.050\n>> Very good, so we did the IP config\n\n221\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.330\nspace forward slash flush DNS like Mike\njust said, can we do this in PowerShell?\n\n222\n00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.450\nWell, and the answer is yes we can,\nwe've got a command that\n\n223\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.000\nis equivalent to the same command you\nwould see inside the command prompt.\n\n224\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.962\nAnd what I like about this,\nnotice that, let me show you this.\n\n225\n00:12:39.962 --> 00:12:44.734\nSo, we did the Get-Dns and\nthen we did ClientCache, right?\n\n226\n00:12:44.734 --> 00:12:49.412\nWell, what I like about the PowerShell,\nall right?\n\n227\n00:12:49.412 --> 00:12:53.659\nAll I have to do is type clear\non the front of that, right?\n\n228\n00:12:53.659 --> 00:12:56.210\nIt's a verb, noun, verb,\nnoun structure, right?\n\n229\n00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.750\nSo, get displays it for me,\nclear does exactly what it sounds like.\n\n230\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:05.640\nClears the DNS client cache and\nthen if I turn around and I rerun and\n\n231\n00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.890\nwe'll take that wild card out there.\n\n232\n00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.820\nNotice that I don't have any\nDNS cache there any more,\n\n233\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.450\nso or those records are no longer cached.\n\n234\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:19.166\nSo we do have the ability to do that\none of the last ones as far as DNS and\n\n235\n00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:23.120\nMike, I showed nslookup let's show\nthe PowerShell equivalent, right?\n\n236\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.780\nDo we have a way to resolve or\n\n237\n00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.896\ntry to resolve names inside\nof PowerShell as well?\n\n238\n00:13:27.896 --> 00:13:34.618\nWell, we do, and\nthat is the resolve, all right.\n\n239\n00:13:34.618 --> 00:13:39.703\nAnd this is DNS name and I could do\nsomething just like we did before, right?\n\n240\n00:13:39.703 --> 00:13:42.698\nI could do Office what was that?\n\n241\n00:13:42.698 --> 00:13:49.300\nThat was actually, Outlook,\nis the one we did.\n\n242\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.370\nRight, outlook.office365.com,\nand notice that, what,\n\n243\n00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.850\nyou could probably format that in a list.\n\n244\n00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.800\nIf I do that pipe character, and\n\n245\n00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.260\nthen do FL as an abbreviation,\nit didn't really do it.\n\n246\n00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.284\nLet's try table, maybe table will work.\n\n247\n00:14:03.284 --> 00:14:04.418\nThat didn't do it.\n\n248\n00:14:04.418 --> 00:14:05.770\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n249\n00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.730\n>> Sometimes you can pipe the output to\n\n250\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.560\na format list, format table makes\nit a little bit easier to see but\n\n251\n00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.950\nlooks like neither of those ones\nreally did what I wanted them to.\n\n252\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.070\nBut, remember how earlier when we seen,\nand in fact, so\n\n253\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.860\nyou can see by comparison\nwhat's going on here.\n\n254\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.320\nLet me go ahead and\nI will open another PowerShell window and\n\n255\n00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.530\nI'll run the other one there,\nthat's the nslookup\n\n256\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:33.090\nagainst that same name and\nyou can kinda see what's going on here.\n\n257\n00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:41.670\nSo that's outlook.office,\nand then it's 365.com.\n\n258\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.820\nAnd notice all of these IP addresses.\n\n259\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.710\nWell, you're getting\nthe same addresses here.\n\n260\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.150\nLet's see if we can find one here.\n\n261\n00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.400\nWe got the 146 in there.\n\n262\n00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.340\nOkay, I don't see it at this time,\n\n263\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.110\nbut what they're doing is they're showing\nyou each individual record, right?\n\n264\n00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:00.320\nThat's being named here rather than just\nsaying, okay, here's the addresses and\n\n265\n00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.380\nhere's the name that was resolved and\nwhat the actual name of the device is or\n\n266\n00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.780\nthe computer in this case.\n\n267\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.070\nAnd we can see that it's just in\na different format but for the most part,\n\n268\n00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.970\nyou're seeing the same information.\n\n269\n00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.760\nThe output just looks\na little bit different here.\n\n270\n00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.740\nSo we do have the ability to test name\nresolution inside the PowerShell.\n\n271\n00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.198\nReminder in the command prompt,\nit's nslookup.\n\n272\n00:15:19.198 --> 00:15:23.077\nIf you're in the PowerShell,\nit's gonna be resolve-dsname.\n\n273\n00:15:23.077 --> 00:15:23.796\n>> Very good.\n\n274\n00:15:23.796 --> 00:15:27.029\nAll right, some other things that\nwe've gotta troubleshoot DNS, once we\n\n275\n00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:30.542\nget that taken care of, we really need to\nmake sure we can connect to the network.\n\n276\n00:15:30.542 --> 00:15:32.413\nThat means that we've\ngotta about IP address,\n\n277\n00:15:32.413 --> 00:15:34.437\nI guess technically that will come first,\nright?\n\n278\n00:15:34.437 --> 00:15:37.260\nWe can't troubleshoot DNS if we\ncan't connect to the network.\n\n279\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.620\n>> Definitely.\n>> So we got to make sure we have\n\n280\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.250\nthe correct IP configuration information\nso DHCP might be our next stop\n\n281\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.410\n>> Yeah, definitely and Mike is right.\n\n282\n00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:49.440\nTypically, [LAUGH] you need an IP\naddress to even communicate so\n\n283\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.270\none of the things that you're gonna wanna\ncheck out are the TCP-IP properties\n\n284\n00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.990\nof your local network adapter and\nverify those.\n\n285\n00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.100\nAnd couple different ways\nthat you can do this,\n\n286\n00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.225\nand I'll kinda show you\nthis side by side here.\n\n287\n00:16:01.225 --> 00:16:05.325\nIf we're in a command prompt, which\nI am here on the right hand side, and\n\n288\n00:16:05.325 --> 00:16:06.344\nI do an ipconfig.\n\n289\n00:16:06.344 --> 00:16:11.429\nI can leave it basic like that if I\njust want some basic information Shows\n\n290\n00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:16.540\nme my IPv4 address, subnet mask,\nand it shows me my default gateway.\n\n291\n00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.410\nSo I can see that I've got an IP address,\nand it is important to make sure that\n\n292\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:23.410\nyou're on the right network, making sure\nthat the subnet mask is set correctly.\n\n293\n00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.543\nA lot of times we're using DHCP,\nwe don't need to set these.\n\n294\n00:16:26.543 --> 00:16:29.746\nBut if I was to come in here and\nI was to see a 169.254,\n\n295\n00:16:29.746 --> 00:16:33.721\nlast two octets can be whatever,\nthere's 65,535 combinations of\n\n296\n00:16:33.721 --> 00:16:38.060\nthose last two octects can be,\nthat's what's called an APIPA address.\n\n297\n00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.910\nAnd this is a failover,\nI don't wanna really say it's a failsafe.\n\n298\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.341\nBut this is a way that you can maintain\nsome low level connectivity when your\n\n299\n00:16:45.341 --> 00:16:49.154\nclient, your DHCP client, is configured\nto call out to the network and say, hey,\n\n300\n00:16:49.154 --> 00:16:50.700\nis there a DHCP server out there?\n\n301\n00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.760\nI need an IP address.\n\n302\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.280\nAnd it gets snoozing,\nit doesn't hear anything.\n\n303\n00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.500\nThen it falls back on\nthis 169.254 address and\n\n304\n00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.040\nthat might be something that\nthey bring up on the exam, too.\n\n305\n00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.700\nYou've seen the output of ipconfig,\nwhat could potentially be the problem?\n\n306\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.710\nAnd that's gonna be the fact that\nthere's something going on with the DHCP\n\n307\n00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.220\nservice here.\n\n308\n00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.730\nNow, I didn't do this with the all switch.\n\n309\n00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.230\nIf I add the all switch, and\n\n310\n00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.865\nthis is actually gonna kinda\nblend in DNS as well, right?\n\n311\n00:17:15.865 --> 00:17:16.387\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n312\n00:17:16.387 --> 00:17:20.130\n>> We need to make sure that we\nhave a DNS server present, right?\n\n313\n00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.850\nSo I can see that I have DNS servers here.\n\n314\n00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.756\nMike, you know what those DNS servers are?\n\n315\n00:17:24.756 --> 00:17:27.724\n>> I do, I can't see them from here but\nI'm guessing Google.\n\n316\n00:17:27.724 --> 00:17:31.466\n>> That's right [LAUGH]\nthese are the 8.8.8.8, and\n\n317\n00:17:31.466 --> 00:17:36.970\n8.8.4.4, so I'm actually using\nGoogle's DNS servers here.\n\n318\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.620\nAnd you can see a lot more information,\nright?\n\n319\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.810\nI can see link-local Address,\n\n320\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.322\nthere's a lot of information\non this list MAC address too.\n\n321\n00:17:43.322 --> 00:17:47.050\nAll right,now let's see what that looks\nlike inside of PowerShell, right.\n\n322\n00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.260\nWe can also do this.\n\n323\n00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.770\nNow the output is different, right?\n\n324\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.460\nSo it's definitely gonna look different.\n\n325\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.599\nThis would be Get-NetIPAddress.\n\n326\n00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:58.338\nAll right, when I run this,\nagain, this is gonna be,\n\n327\n00:17:58.338 --> 00:18:02.153\neven though the output is formatted\ndifferent, it really is a lot of the same\n\n328\n00:18:02.153 --> 00:18:05.760\ninformation, even some more\ninformation here, too.\n\n329\n00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.970\nSo one of the things that I'll have\nto do is I'll have to scroll down and\n\n330\n00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.660\nfigure out which one of these\nis my actual network adapter.\n\n331\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.450\nAnd one of the things that you do\nis you look for the InterfaceAlias.\n\n332\n00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:21.191\nInterfaceAlias is gonna tell you which\none of these you're actually looking for.\n\n333\n00:18:21.191 --> 00:18:22.887\nAnd interestingly enough,\n\n334\n00:18:22.887 --> 00:18:27.530\nlooks like we've got a Teredo\nadapter there too and there we go.\n\n335\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.995\nSince the Bluetooth is turned off,\nnotice that it gets an IP address and\n\n336\n00:18:30.995 --> 00:18:34.193\nthat's that 169.254 and\nthen the last two octets there.\n\n337\n00:18:34.193 --> 00:18:38.410\nInteresting that's an APIPA address, just\nso you guys can see what it looks like.\n\n338\n00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.250\nBut here I can see\nthe InterfaceAlias is Ethernet0.\n\n339\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.680\nHow do I know that's\nthe right network adapter?\n\n340\n00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.590\nWell, I'm gonna kinda jump\nthe gun on you here, Mike.\n\n341\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.040\nI'm gonna bring up the Network and\nSharing Center here so\n\n342\n00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.150\nwe can kinda see where that\ncomes into play for us.\n\n343\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:58.290\nAll right, and that's inside of the\nNetwork and Sharing Center, and then if I\n\n344\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:04.620\ngo to Change adapter settings, all right,\nI can see that I've got, what, Ethernet0.\n\n345\n00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.110\nAnd you can see the name here and\n\n346\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:11.070\nthat's directly related to this\nInterfaceAlias that we see right here.\n\n347\n00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.578\nSo, you can identify here\nthe TCPIP properties of your\n\n348\n00:19:15.578 --> 00:19:19.935\nnetwork adapter and verify that\nyou've got the right DNS servers,\n\n349\n00:19:19.935 --> 00:19:24.525\nverify that you've got an IP address and\nyou're connected to the network.\n\n350\n00:19:24.525 --> 00:19:28.877\nOne of the other things that you\ncan do to, is if you're looking for\n\n351\n00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:32.768\nmore information that's\nspecific to the IPv4 protocol,\n\n352\n00:19:32.768 --> 00:19:36.684\nyou do have this Get-NetIPv4 and\nthen that's Protocol.\n\n353\n00:19:36.684 --> 00:19:40.553\nAnd you can get some basic information\nabout that protocol there too because\n\n354\n00:19:40.553 --> 00:19:42.560\nthat's what we're typically using.\n\n355\n00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.464\nAnd you can see now\nIPv6 as well [LAUGH] so\n\n356\n00:19:45.464 --> 00:19:49.606\nwe can see some information\ndirectly related to IPv4.\n\n357\n00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:55.993\nNow, we can also, if we want,\nwe can use another command which,\n\n358\n00:19:55.993 --> 00:20:00.638\ncommandlet, excuse me,\nlet me be correct in my\n\n359\n00:20:00.638 --> 00:20:05.820\nterminology here,\nis Get-NetIPConfiguration.\n\n360\n00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.990\nAll right, and I like this one as well,\ngive it a second here.\n\n361\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.990\nBecause what it does,\nI don't need that InterfaceAlias there.\n\n362\n00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.870\nNotice that it gives me a format that's\na little bit closer to what you would see\n\n363\n00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:17.406\non ipconfig.\n\n364\n00:20:17.406 --> 00:20:18.308\nLooks like ipconfig.\n\n365\n00:20:18.308 --> 00:20:23.787\n>> Yeah, exactly, so if you're really\nused to the ipconfig format and\n\n366\n00:20:23.787 --> 00:20:27.850\nyou don't like what\nthe Get-NetIPAddress does,\n\n367\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.628\nlike I said it sneezes\nall over your shell here,\n\n368\n00:20:31.628 --> 00:20:35.450\nyou can also do\nthe Get-NetIPConfiguration.\n\n369\n00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:39.810\nIt tells you the InterfaceAlias, it even\ntells me what the network adapter is too.\n\n370\n00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.820\nMaybe I'm thinking there's a driver\nissue with the network adapter.\n\n371\n00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.340\nWell, a couple of places that we can go.\n\n372\n00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.280\nWe can go into Device Manager,\n\n373\n00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.490\nwhich is one that I didn't think I was\ngonna mention, but you might as well,\n\n374\n00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.130\ncuz we're talking about local, right,\nwe're talking about the computer.\n\n375\n00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.420\nSo I'm just gonna right-click\non the Windows charm here, and\n\n376\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.090\nwe're gonna go to good old Device Manager.\n\n377\n00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.878\nAnd what I get the ability to do here\nis find out if I am having a network\n\n378\n00:21:05.878 --> 00:21:07.559\ncommunication issue,\n\n379\n00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:13.114\ndoes it boil down to the fact that the\nnetwork adapter itself is having issues?\n\n380\n00:21:13.114 --> 00:21:13.892\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n381\n00:21:13.892 --> 00:21:18.868\n>> And if I kinda zoom in here on\nthis information, you can see that,\n\n382\n00:21:18.868 --> 00:21:25.790\nsure enough, PowerShell tells me right\naway what network adapter I have here.\n\n383\n00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.440\nAnd again, the same information\nI see inside of Device Manager.\n\n384\n00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.880\nIf I was to come in here and I was to\nsee some kinda question mark next to\n\n385\n00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.270\nthe Network Adapter, it'd tell me there's\nprobably something wrong with the device\n\n386\n00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.220\n>> Or at this point,\n\n387\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.540\neven something wrong with the driver.\n\n388\n00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.220\nSo even though I don't know\nthat they're gonna call that on\n\n389\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.330\nthe MTA Cloud Fundamentals exam,\nit's good information to know regardless,\n\n390\n00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:45.880\nespecially when it comes\nto troubleshooting.\n\n391\n00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.103\nSo DHCP, Mike,\nwe got a handful of commands and\n\n392\n00:21:49.103 --> 00:21:54.680\ncommandlets that you can use to verify\nthat their DHCP configuration is correct.\n\n393\n00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.347\nAnd I completely agree with Mike,\nthis should actually be checked prior\n\n394\n00:21:58.347 --> 00:22:02.310\nto DNS because if you don't have\nan IP address, DNS isn't gonna work.\n\n395\n00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.220\n>> Yeah, you wont be able to do it\nany of your DNS testing either if you\n\n396\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.700\ncan't connect to the network, right?\n\n397\n00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.716\nBut hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.\n\n398\n00:22:08.716 --> 00:22:11.480\nAll right, another thing that\nwe deal with is routing, right?\n\n399\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.430\nWe might have an IP address\nthat's valid on our network.\n\n400\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.939\nWe might have a local DNS server that's\non that same subnet that we can talk to.\n\n401\n00:22:18.939 --> 00:22:23.020\nSo maybe we get through all those tests,\nbut I can't get any further, right?\n\n402\n00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.750\nHow do we check that?\n\n403\n00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.250\nThat's where our routing\ntroubleshooting tools come into play.\n\n404\n00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.460\n>> That's right, and one of the oldies but\ngoodies there, that's been around for\n\n405\n00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.740\na while, is the the TRACERT.\n\n406\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.861\nSometimes you guys might\nhear it called traceroute,\n\n407\n00:22:33.861 --> 00:22:36.401\nI know you guys out there that\nare used to Unix and Linux, I mean,\n\n408\n00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:39.772\nit's called traceroute in there, but\nTRACERT inside of the Windows environment.\n\n409\n00:22:39.772 --> 00:22:43.998\nAnd what this allows you to do is\ndetermine the path a packet takes between\n\n410\n00:22:43.998 --> 00:22:47.812\nsource and destination and\nsee all the stops along the way as it's\n\n411\n00:22:47.812 --> 00:22:51.728\nhanded between routers\nacross the Internet here.\n\n412\n00:22:51.728 --> 00:22:55.250\nSo, TRACERT, again,\n\n413\n00:22:55.250 --> 00:23:00.050\nI gotta be careful with this one because\nthe ping utility uses the ICMP protocol,\n\n414\n00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.250\nInternet Message Control Protocol and\nit could be blocked, right?\n\n415\n00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.960\nWe do ping blocking because there's types\nof attacks that could exploit that ICMP\n\n416\n00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:13.330\nprotocol there so\nthey might be blocking a ping.\n\n417\n00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.876\nThe same thing goes with traceroute so\nlet's be careful with that.\n\n418\n00:23:15.876 --> 00:23:20.758\nCuz that also uses, what this does is it\njust sends multiple ICMP requests to every\n\n419\n00:23:20.758 --> 00:23:25.429\nsingle router as this passes, this packet\nof data passes through its source to\n\n420\n00:23:25.429 --> 00:23:28.438\ndestination on the way to\nits destination there.\n\n421\n00:23:28.438 --> 00:23:31.160\nAnd if ICMP's being blocked,\n\n422\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.670\neven at any one of those router levels,\nyou might see a request timed out.\n\n423\n00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.196\nLet's check it out here,\nlet's see what we get.\n\n424\n00:23:36.196 --> 00:23:40.550\nSo we're doing tracert and again,\nwe're gonna go back to the old outlook,\n\n425\n00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:46.640\nI'm picking on Outlook today,\n.office365.com,\n\n426\n00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.350\nall right, and we're gonna run.\n\n427\n00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.020\nNow see, notice real quick too here, and\n\n428\n00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.780\nlet me zoom in as it starts its process,\nMike.\n\n429\n00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:59.424\ntracert, I know I didn't really call it\nout as being a DNS troubleshooting tool\n\n430\n00:23:59.424 --> 00:24:02.695\ncuz we've got other tools\nthat we commonly use for DNS.\n\n431\n00:24:02.695 --> 00:24:06.854\nBut one of the things that you'll notice\nis that name that we resolved earlier,\n\n432\n00:24:06.854 --> 00:24:11.076\nnotice that it resolved the name right to\nits IP address because I did a tracert not\n\n433\n00:24:11.076 --> 00:24:13.212\nwith the IP address, but with the name.\n\n434\n00:24:13.212 --> 00:24:14.592\nSo, you have to understand\na couple of things.\n\n435\n00:24:14.592 --> 00:24:18.417\nIf I see mp's being blocked you're\nnot going to find any results and\n\n436\n00:24:18.417 --> 00:24:22.848\nthe other thing is if name resolution\nisn't happening you're gonna have to do\n\n437\n00:24:22.848 --> 00:24:25.150\na trace RT by IP address and not by name.\n\n438\n00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:30.035\nThere we go, so I can see some information\nhere, right, and I can find out, and\n\n439\n00:24:30.035 --> 00:24:32.855\nthere we go, you're gonna start\nseeing some request timed out.\n\n440\n00:24:32.855 --> 00:24:35.355\nMost likely, as I can see that this, and\n\n441\n00:24:35.355 --> 00:24:37.555\nwe'll get back to it\nonce it finishes here.\n\n442\n00:24:37.555 --> 00:24:39.735\nI can see that it went out to, look,\n\n443\n00:24:39.735 --> 00:24:42.725\nwe got some,\nwe're GRUCom here in Gainesville.\n\n444\n00:24:42.725 --> 00:24:45.695\nSo I can see, what's the information\nthat I'm seeing here?\n\n445\n00:24:45.695 --> 00:24:48.155\nLet's make it a little bit easier, right.\n\n446\n00:24:48.155 --> 00:24:52.352\nI've got make it easier,\nthat's not gonna make it easier.\n\n447\n00:24:52.352 --> 00:24:56.190\nAll right, so in this area, in fact,\nrather than just type it out guys,\n\n448\n00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:57.910\nI know it's gonna be kinda hard to see.\n\n449\n00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.020\nThis is my local ISP, All right?\n\n450\n00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.880\nAnd then we go straight out to, what?\n\n451\n00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.240\nInternet backbone for providers right?\n\n452\n00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.450\nThe IDPs these are the top\ndogs when it comes to\n\n453\n00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.510\nthe internet ISP infrastructure out there.\n\n454\n00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:16.120\nYou can see level three Cogent\nare some of the other ones there but\n\n455\n00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.980\nthen I can see it hops right\non Microsoft's network.\n\n456\n00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.870\nNow, there's gonna be a certain\npoint where Microsoft's\n\n457\n00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.860\nnot gonna want you to know\nall the information, right?\n\n458\n00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:29.530\nThey might have a couple of their\nconnectivity devices here that are saying,\n\n459\n00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.735\nyou're asking us for information and\nwe're really not gonna give that to you.\n\n460\n00:25:32.735 --> 00:25:36.950\nCuz this information can always\nbe used to start profiling and\n\n461\n00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.940\nhacking attacks, so\nthey might just block that.\n\n462\n00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.640\nBut I can see that I do\nhave end to end routing.\n\n463\n00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.704\nNow, where can I use this\ninformation to troubleshoot, right?\n\n464\n00:25:47.704 --> 00:25:52.530\nWell, that's gonna be, I'm gonna\ntell you what, let me change this\n\n465\n00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:57.360\ncolor here real quick, make it a little\neasier on you guys out there to see.\n\n466\n00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.007\nAnd I won't torture everybody's\neyes with the matrix colors there.\n\n467\n00:26:03.007 --> 00:26:07.510\n[LAUGH]\nSo, what can I do with this information?\n\n468\n00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.420\nWell, in this realm or\nin this area, right,\n\n469\n00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.601\nwith the local ISP, right,\n\n470\n00:26:15.601 --> 00:26:20.410\nwith the local ISP,\nif I see these requests\n\n471\n00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:24.330\ntimed out that we see here in Microsoft's\nnetwork, I can call up my local ISP and\n\n472\n00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.600\nsay hey, we've got a service\nlevel agreement, what's going on.\n\n473\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.380\nWe can say that it got\npast our gateway and\n\n474\n00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.300\nthe moment it hit your networks,\nI'm getting a request timed out, right?\n\n475\n00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.250\nAnd at that point,\nwe might be able to call the local ISP.\n\n476\n00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:42.570\nNow when it comes to these\nthree right here, all right.\n\n477\n00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.320\nThere's absolutely nothing\nI can do about that, why?\n\n478\n00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.670\nYou don't call the internet\nbackbone provider.\n\n479\n00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.580\nRight the guys that lay, the companies\nthat laid the foundation for the backbone\n\n480\n00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.710\nof the internet and say hey what's wrong,\nwhat's going on with your networks?\n\n481\n00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.090\nI've got some of the most brilliant\nengineers in the world and\n\n482\n00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.120\nthey're trained to deal with\nthese things in seconds.\n\n483\n00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.650\nHowever, now we get out to,\nwhat's the next one, right?\n\n484\n00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.100\nNow we've got the content provider,\nright, in this case it's Microsoft.\n\n485\n00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.980\nIf I start to see some timed out,\ntiming out here, what am I gonna do?\n\n486\n00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.730\nWell, I could open a support ticket for\nMicrosoft, but\n\n487\n00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.530\none of the easiest things would be\nto do is to correlate this with for\n\n488\n00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:21.700\ninstance, and again, kinda jumping\nthe gun on you, Mike, here on it, but\n\n489\n00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.915\nit's directly related to service health,\nright?\n\n490\n00:27:23.915 --> 00:27:24.910\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n491\n00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.288\n>> If I go to my service health,\n\n492\n00:27:27.288 --> 00:27:31.555\nif I could say that with\nmy Mike Tyson accent there.\n\n493\n00:27:31.555 --> 00:27:35.234\n[LAUGH] Office 365 Admin Center, I might\ncome in here and I might find, like for\n\n494\n00:27:35.234 --> 00:27:38.262\ninstance, MDM here,\nwe can see that there's some information,\n\n495\n00:27:38.262 --> 00:27:40.110\nsomething's going wrong here.\n\n496\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.170\nMight wanna look at this information and\nfind out,\n\n497\n00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.220\nhey, are they having an issue\nwith one of their services there?\n\n498\n00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.010\nSo I could take that information,\ndepending on where the trace RT\n\n499\n00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.950\ntells me that the path is failing, and\nthen come back here to service health in\n\n500\n00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:57.760\nthe admin center and\ntry to figure that out, all right now.\n\n501\n00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.740\nPowerShell is not without one here as\nwell, we could also do this in PowerShell.\n\n502\n00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.460\nAnd let me switch back over to\ncommand prompt, not command prompt.\n\n503\n00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:12.000\nExit the PowerShell, exit, there we go.\n\n504\n00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.153\nIt didn't like the exit,\napparently I typed it right.\n\n505\n00:28:15.153 --> 00:28:16.758\n[LAUGH].\n\n506\n00:28:16.758 --> 00:28:20.850\nAnd so now what we can do is if we need\nto, we can also do a test connection.\n\n507\n00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:30.000\nRight, and I can do a test connection\noutlook.office.365.com and\n\n508\n00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.180\nwe can let this run.\n\n509\n00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.180\nNow, what is this doing?\n\n510\n00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.430\nThis is doing more like a ping\npacket would be doing inside of your\n\n511\n00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:38.100\ncommand prompt.\n\n512\n00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.400\nSo I can also test communications\nbetween my source in the endpoint.\n\n513\n00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.137\nNow, the difference here is it's not\nreally gonna show me any information.\n\n514\n00:28:46.137 --> 00:28:49.829\nI might say one of the last ones that,\nthat I didn't put in the list and\n\n515\n00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:52.770\nprobably should is the path ping command.\n\n516\n00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.950\nNow path ping, what does this do?\n\n517\n00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:59.429\nWell with path ping this takes\nboth trace RT that we've seen and\n\n518\n00:28:59.429 --> 00:29:02.370\nping and it combines them together.\n\n519\n00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:07.193\nAnd I believe if I remember right,\nMike, I think it goes from,\n\n520\n00:29:07.193 --> 00:29:12.835\nfrom sending, trace RT, I believe\nsends ten ICMP messages per router and\n\n521\n00:29:12.835 --> 00:29:16.304\nI believe path ping sends 100 per router.\n\n522\n00:29:16.304 --> 00:29:19.799\n>> Yeah, gives you a little more\ninformation, a little more statistics on\n\n523\n00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:22.630\nthe performance of each one of\nthose routers in that path.\n\n524\n00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:23.670\n>> Exactly.\n\n525\n00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.940\nSo now I can see with path ping,\nit looks the same, right?\n\n526\n00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.870\nThat was actually pretty quick, so you\ncould see up here, what it's gonna do is,\n\n527\n00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:35.170\nit's gonna do the trace RT, but then we\nshould see computing statistics here,\n\n528\n00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.710\ncuz it gathers all that information,\nlike Mike was saying,\n\n529\n00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.790\na lot, lot of information and\nit calculates things like round trip time,\n\n530\n00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:47.390\nthe percentage from my computer to them,\nfrom them back to me.\n\n531\n00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.680\nLatencies, it calculates that.\n\n532\n00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.240\nWhat is the percentage of packets\nsent versus what was lost?\n\n533\n00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.800\nAnd calculates that information but\nyou can see, it can take a while here,\n\n534\n00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.040\nso there's also path ping and\nI would used that.\n\n535\n00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.950\nSo, We do have some of those\ntechnology that are might that can\n\n536\n00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:06.130\nuse to test things like for an instance.\n\n537\n00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.400\nOther, you know the routing and\n\n538\n00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:12.945\nthen the communications between my\ncomputer and your office 365 platform.\n\n539\n00:30:12.945 --> 00:30:14.035\n>> You've already shown us once.\n\n540\n00:30:14.035 --> 00:30:16.497\nWe can take a look again at that\ngood old network and sharing center.\n\n541\n00:30:16.497 --> 00:30:17.804\n>> Definitely.\n>> [CROSSTALK] need to go.\n\n542\n00:30:17.804 --> 00:30:18.715\n>> That's right.\n\n543\n00:30:18.715 --> 00:30:21.335\nNow, a couple different ways\nthat you can get to this.\n\n544\n00:30:21.335 --> 00:30:25.555\nI use the little monitor icon,\nmy head's kind of covering it up here.\n\n545\n00:30:25.555 --> 00:30:29.040\nI use the little monitor icon\nWith a trident pitchfork on here,\n\n546\n00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.450\nyou can also go into the control panel.\n\n547\n00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.710\nI like to keep it\na little bit easier here.\n\n548\n00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:38.040\nNow what this can do is, this basically\ncan tell me if I've got connectivity.\n\n549\n00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.140\nWhat is the profile that I'm connected to?\n\n550\n00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.890\nBecause that directly affects certain\nsecurity settings within the Windows\n\n551\n00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.530\noperating system.\n\n552\n00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.150\nI can also go over here to\nchange adapter settings.\n\n553\n00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.040\nNow, when I go to change adapter settings,\nyou've already seen this,\n\n554\n00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.110\nthis is where I can test if I went through\ntheir graphical user interface and\n\n555\n00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.250\nI'm kind of jumping through these quick.\n\n556\n00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.440\nLet me slow down a little bit,\nand show you guys what I'm doing.\n\n557\n00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.990\nRight clicking on that interface,\n\n558\n00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:05.850\nit brings up the status dialog box,\nthis has been renamed Ethernet zero.\n\n559\n00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:09.090\nIf you guys in your organizations\nmost likely, if you haven't changed\n\n560\n00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.650\nany of the defaults you would just\nbe called a local area connection.\n\n561\n00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.540\nIf you got more than one adapter it just\nappends the number two to the end of it.\n\n562\n00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.380\nBut then I could see all the that same\ninformation that we were looking at in\n\n563\n00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.160\nthe IPConfig utility,\nright here in a graphical user interface.\n\n564\n00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.800\nI can also if I need to, adjust\nthe properties of my network adapter.\n\n565\n00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.480\nMost often, our clients are going to be\nusing DHCP, but if they happen to be using\n\n566\n00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.620\na static IP address,\nit could be a misconfiguration there.\n\n567\n00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.610\nI can select here the properties\nof the network adapter, IBB4.\n\n568\n00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.580\nChoose Properties and\nthen I can set those accordingly.\n\n569\n00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:44.580\nSo, Mike, again looks like we've\ngot some things that we can look at\n\n570\n00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.830\nas far as the network connections and\n\n571\n00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.610\nlocal area connection through network and\nsharing, so.\n\n572\n00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.060\n>> All right.\nSo now let's move on beyond that, then.\n\n573\n00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:55.470\nWe've done a lot of our local and\nwe've made our way out to the internet.\n\n574\n00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:59.271\nNow we wanna take a look at some tools\nthat are specific to Office 365.\n\n575\n00:31:59.271 --> 00:32:03.725\n>> Definitely, you know, in fact one we\nkind of correlated already when we were\n\n576\n00:32:03.725 --> 00:32:08.395\ntaking the trace RT information and we've\nseen some time out request time down.\n\n577\n00:32:08.395 --> 00:32:13.040\nI said, well if it happens to be on\nMicrosoft's network where those time outs\n\n578\n00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.976\nhappen, Go right into your\nOffice 365 admin dashboard here.\n\n579\n00:32:16.976 --> 00:32:21.391\nAnd here on the right or left hand side,\nif I knew my right from my left.\n\n580\n00:32:21.391 --> 00:32:26.364\nYou'll see the service help location and\nthe service help\n\n581\n00:32:26.364 --> 00:32:31.143\nlocation takes me well,\nto my service health console.\n\n582\n00:32:31.143 --> 00:32:35.961\nAnd then what I can do is I can\nfind out all the current status for\n\n583\n00:32:35.961 --> 00:32:39.763\nall the individual services\nthat are offered and\n\n584\n00:32:39.763 --> 00:32:45.342\nI even get some information here as\nto what all these little icons mean?\n\n585\n00:32:45.342 --> 00:32:49.320\nSo for instance, one of the things\nthat I know that happened,\n\n586\n00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.702\nin fact last week, I believe it was.\n\n587\n00:32:51.702 --> 00:32:56.415\nIn fact, they're telling you right here,\nSkype for Business sign in issues, right?\n\n588\n00:32:56.415 --> 00:33:00.670\nSo you could see,\nright here if I do Sign-In.\n\n589\n00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:04.140\nAnd then I could find out a couple days\nago we were having some kind of issue\n\n590\n00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.340\nwith that, right?\n\n591\n00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.900\nWell, if I click that exclamation point,\nI can come in and\n\n592\n00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.170\nI can get information based\non what was that issue?\n\n593\n00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.098\nWhat did it really mean for us?\n\n594\n00:33:14.098 --> 00:33:18.108\nAnd it will give me an overview of\nthe issue that was happening there.\n\n595\n00:33:18.108 --> 00:33:20.241\nA couple of the other utilities\nthat we have as well,\n\n596\n00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:22.820\nwe've got what is known as\nthe remote connectivity analyzer.\n\n597\n00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.610\nNow with the remote connectivity analyzer,\n\n598\n00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:30.680\nthis is gonna be something that is,\nis also found from the Admin tools.\n\n599\n00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.590\nGet back to my Admin,\nmain admin console here.\n\n600\n00:33:35.745 --> 00:33:43.040\nAll right, and if we go to Tools and\nwe launch this up.\n\n601\n00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.300\nYou're gonna see that we have\nquite a few utilities here.\n\n602\n00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:51.930\nYou've got the check your Office 365\nconfiguration ready health readiness and\n\n603\n00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.350\nconnectivity tool.\n\n604\n00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.580\nyou've got the Microsoft\nconnectivity analyzer.\n\n605\n00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.110\nThis is the one that installs locally and\n\n606\n00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.880\nI mentioned the remote connectivity\nanalyzer, let me be careful.\n\n607\n00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.452\nThat's actually [LAUGH] that's found\nin the Skype for Business console, so\n\n608\n00:34:05.452 --> 00:34:07.245\nif I go to Skype for Business.\n\n609\n00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:12.750\nWait for it, and\nwe go to the Admin Center for this.\n\n610\n00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.360\nWe're gonna go to Tools in\nthe dashboard on the left hand side.\n\n611\n00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.140\nAnd then here we go,\nthe Remote Connectivity Analyzer.\n\n612\n00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.621\nThis is a very cool interface.\n\n613\n00:34:21.621 --> 00:34:26.721\nIf I launch this, this actually takes me\nout to a connectivity test that we can do.\n\n614\n00:34:26.721 --> 00:34:32.420\nWe can do this against Exchange servers,\nyour Skype servers, Office 365.\n\n615\n00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.536\nWe can test the name resolution.\n\n616\n00:34:34.536 --> 00:34:37.837\nIf you're doing emails,\nyou can test your different email,\n\n617\n00:34:37.837 --> 00:34:40.470\ndo your different email tasks as well.\n\n618\n00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.800\nAnd with the Client Performance Analyzer,\nit doesn't install locally.\n\n619\n00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:49.739\nSo on my Windows 10 machine here, if I\ntype client I can launch the Office 365.\n\n620\n00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.430\nClient performance analyzer there and\n\n621\n00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:57.940\nit gives me the ability to run this\nagainst Exchange or SharePoint.\n\n622\n00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.660\nSo if I want I can, for instance,\nI'll run it against SharePoint.\n\n623\n00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.350\nIt's gonna ask me what is the sites?\n\n624\n00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:07.770\nThe team site that you're worried about\nand what is the one that is in question.\n\n625\n00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:11.690\nIf I wanna run this against Exchange,\nI can do it against a specific mailbox.\n\n626\n00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:15.425\nAnd one of the good things about using\nthis for Exchange is the fact that\n\n627\n00:35:15.425 --> 00:35:19.918\nMicrosoft is gonna test this, and they're\ngonna send an email to this mailbox, and\n\n628\n00:35:19.918 --> 00:35:21.963\nthey'll give you some results here.\n\n629\n00:35:21.963 --> 00:35:25.398\nWe can choose OK,\nit takes a few minutes, it could take up\n\n630\n00:35:25.398 --> 00:35:29.907\nto a few minutes to complete, and\nit's running through a series of tests,\n\n631\n00:35:29.907 --> 00:35:34.294\nit's checking things like ports,\ndo you have port 80, is it open,?\n\n632\n00:35:34.294 --> 00:35:36.890\nCan we send information for Port 443?\n\n633\n00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:40.250\nPort 587 for things like SMTP relay.\n\n634\n00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:45.250\nAnd it wants to make sure that those\nports aren't closed, because that can\n\n635\n00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.710\nbe something that's potentially blocking\nyour communication if for instance,\n\n636\n00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.460\nyou can't send and receive emails.\n\n637\n00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.204\nAgain, if I'm having a problem\nconnecting to one of my team sites or\n\n638\n00:35:54.204 --> 00:35:57.357\nwhatever the sites are that I\ncreate it could be a blog that\n\n639\n00:35:57.357 --> 00:36:00.415\nI've created up there\non the SharePoint site.\n\n640\n00:36:00.415 --> 00:36:03.583\nWell then, I can run it against that and\nall I have to do is put the URL.\n\n641\n00:36:03.583 --> 00:36:11.185\nAnd so, the OCPA, or again\nthe Online Client Performance analyzer.\n\n642\n00:36:11.185 --> 00:36:13.675\nIt's a really good thing to have.\n\n643\n00:36:13.675 --> 00:36:18.020\nI think one other one that we wanna,\nwe probably want to mention here Is the,\n\n644\n00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.740\nMike, the Skype for\nBusiness online sign in.\n\n645\n00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.560\nBecause this was, you know,\nmost of these utilities are for admins.\n\n646\n00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.250\nBut what I like is they call it out,\nthey're like, yeah, this isn't for\n\n647\n00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.190\nyour end users.\n\n648\n00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.625\nThis is only for the admins.\n\n649\n00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:31.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you can see that right there,\n\n650\n00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.880\ntroubleshooting Skype for Business\nonline sign in for administrators.\n\n651\n00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:41.000\nThis is actually a website,\njust like the test connectivity analyzer.\n\n652\n00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.050\nAnd this is really cool because\nit goes through the process of\n\n653\n00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:45.990\nasking you a few questions.\n\n654\n00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:50.030\nGuys, do not confuse the fact that we've\ntalked about this in our Skype for\n\n655\n00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.870\nBusiness episode.\n\n656\n00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.640\nDo not confuse the fact that\nthis says Lyncs Online.\n\n657\n00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.420\nAgain, that was just a former name,\nit's now called Skype for Business, today.\n\n658\n00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.440\nAnd what I can do is I can start\nthis running through this wizard and\n\n659\n00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.390\nI can point it.\n\n660\n00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.560\nI can say, okay,\nwho's having the problem, like for\n\n661\n00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.270\ninstance I could say everybody in a\nspecific group or at a single location and\n\n662\n00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:12.520\nwe walk through there and they say, are\nyou using a custom domain with Office 365?\n\n663\n00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:16.058\nNow I could already tell you if I say\nyes most likely what's gonna happen,\n\n664\n00:37:16.058 --> 00:37:18.182\nthey're gonna say check your DNS records.\n\n665\n00:37:18.182 --> 00:37:21.697\nAll right, so if I say, are you using\na custom domain with Office 365?\n\n666\n00:37:21.697 --> 00:37:24.000\nWe're gonna say Yes.\n\n667\n00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.080\nWe're gonna say Enterprise.\n\n668\n00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.520\nAnd it says,\ndo you have a hybrid deployment right?\n\n669\n00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.290\nDo we have something on premise and\noff premise?\n\n670\n00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:30.830\nI'm gonna say no.\n\n671\n00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.530\nI'm gonna say we put\neverything in the cloud.\n\n672\n00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:36.650\nAll right, it says, have you\nalready set up your custom domain?\n\n673\n00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:37.480\nWe're gonna say yes.\n\n674\n00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:43.390\nAll right, and then they say,\nnow make sure everything works,\n\n675\n00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:48.060\nexpected, by running the domain\ntroubleshooter inside of the admin center.\n\n676\n00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.200\nOne of the common things that\nyou will get, if you run this,\n\n677\n00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.870\nis they're gonna say, how do we have some\nDNS records that aren't typed correctly,\n\n678\n00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.600\naren't set up right?\n\n679\n00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.660\nBecause if you've off-loaded\nDNS right to Microsoft and\n\n680\n00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:01.490\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n681\n00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:04.030\nThey're managed the DNS\ninfrastructure internally now,\n\n682\n00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:07.510\nagain we don't wanna get on just go\noff into DNS or anything like that.\n\n683\n00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:10.490\nBut this would give me that wizard\nthat I can walk through and\n\n684\n00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:14.370\nI can answer a few questions that are\nspecific to my tenant the problems that\n\n685\n00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.570\nwere having and they'll give you\nan answer, like you can see here.\n\n686\n00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:21.660\nThey'll say hey run that domain\ntroubleshooter and you can find out.\n\n687\n00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.310\nIt will go through things\nlike auto discovery DNS or\n\n688\n00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:27.700\nDNS auto discovery excuse me to\nfind out hey can I go out there?\n\n689\n00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.170\nCan I resolve these names?\n\n690\n00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:32.090\nAnd if I cant resolve these names\nchances are you need to update your\n\n691\n00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.050\nDNS Infrastructure.\n\n692\n00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:37.800\nSo Mike, we've got some tools that\nare built in that we can take with us.\n\n693\n00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.070\nWe don't even need a subscription.\n\n694\n00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.364\nThey use those utilities,\nthings that we've used for\n\n695\n00:38:42.364 --> 00:38:47.017\nyears testing normal local communication\nas well as the stuff that built in to\n\n696\n00:38:47.017 --> 00:38:49.820\nOffice 365 that you can connect online to.\n\n697\n00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.940\nThe admin console and you can run a bunch\nutilities depending on the service\n\n698\n00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.070\nthat is in question and\nmay be having the problem.\n\n699\n00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:00.680\n>> Very good Wes, a great look at all the\ndifferent tools that are at our fingertips\n\n700\n00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.350\nfor troubleshooting both locally and\naccess out there into the cloud.\n\n701\n00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:06.010\nSo thanks for that.\n\n702\n00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.570\nThanks for those great demos.\n\n703\n00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:09.820\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n704\n00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.360\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n705\n00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.400\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n706\n00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.520\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n707\n00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:19.500\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
