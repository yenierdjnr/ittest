this\n\n3\n00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.370\nnew series we're coming out with, which is\nthe MTA Cloud Fundamental series coming\n\n4\n00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.530\nfrom ITProTV and Microsoft,\nwho provides the actual content for this.\n\n5\n00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.610\nAnd joining me along here is Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.870\nWes, we got you here cuz you're\ngonna help us figure out what,\n\n7\n00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.060\nlet me just start with,\nwhat is this show about?\n\n8\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.320\nWhat can we expect from this show?\n\n9\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.840\n>> Well, one of the things that you're\ngonna see that is gonna be prevalent\n\n10\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.210\nthroughout this entire series is\ndemonstrating the fundamental knowledge,\n\n11\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.510\nthe basic principles that you\nsee in the Microsoft Cloud.\n\n12\n00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.020\nUsing basic skills.\n\n13\n00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.230\nThat's one of the things that's gonna\ncome up throughout the entire series.\n\n14\n00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.150\nIf you haven't seen or\nheard anything about the Cloud,\n\n15\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.720\nit's kind of hard in today's day\nnot to hear about the Cloud, but\n\n16\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.640\nmaybe some of these topics\nare a little bit confusing.\n\n17\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.280\nYou're going to see some of the\nfundamentals and some of the basic stuff\n\n18\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.750\nthat you need to be familiar with in order\nto get into Microsoft Cloud technologies.\n\n19\n00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.340\n>> Awesome.\n\n20\n00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.810\nNow Wes, what can we expect\nfrom the upcoming after this.\n\n21\n00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.380\nWhat can we expect content\nwise to see in those?\n\n22\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.250\n>> Well we're gonna be talking about\nthings like the service models\n\n23\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.980\nthat you can see.\n\n24\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.670\nYou know,\n\n25\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.470\nwhat are the different technologies that\nwe use when we talk about the cloud?\n\n26\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.180\nWhat does it even mean when\nwe talk about the cloud?\n\n27\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.420\nWe're gonna talk about\nthings like security.\n\n28\n00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.190\nSecuring that data when it's\nnot stored in our location, so\n\n29\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.560\nwe'll talk about things like security.\n\n30\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.550\nWe'll even look at how to\nconnect different services,\n\n31\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.260\nthe things like the Office 365 interface.\n\n32\n00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.480\nLook at the interface,\nsee what the interface is about,\n\n33\n00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.720\nsee how to use it, as well as\nthings like Microsoft InTune, and\n\n34\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.260\nwalk through some of the Microsoft InTune\ntechnologies likewise.\n\n35\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.970\n>> Awesome.\n\n36\n00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.340\nA really good question would be next\nis who is our intended audience?\n\n37\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.390\nWho will benefit from this series?\n\n38\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.970\n>> Well, if you are somebody that's\nlooking demonstrate to maybe an employer\n\n39\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.120\nor maybe a prospective employer that\nyou have that fundamental knowledge,\n\n40\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.470\nthat basic entry level skill,\nthat if somebody was to ask you a question\n\n41\n00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.700\nabout the Microsoft Cloud platform,\nyou'd be able to answer them.\n\n42\n00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.080\nYou'd be able to give\na conversation to them.\n\n43\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.900\nSo you're going to see that this is\nreally geared to people who already have\n\n44\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.820\nsome basic hands-on experience.\n\n45\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.040\nMaybe you've seen Office365 before.\n\n46\n00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.270\nHave you worked with firewalls,\nhave you worked with InTune?\n\n47\n00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.810\nMaybe not.\n\n48\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.090\nIt's not a requirement.\n\n49\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.600\nBut if you've got some introductory\nknowledge to Microsoft InTune that's\n\n50\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.470\na very good thing to have.\n\n51\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.750\nDo you have experience in things\nlike networking topologies,\n\n52\n00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.500\ndifferent devices in network ports.\n\n53\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.850\nIf you have some of those basic level\nskills then this is gonna be right up your\n\n54\n00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.640\nalley in moving,\nin stepping into the cloud technology.\n\n55\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.760\n>> Awesome.\nNow will the people watching need to have\n\n56\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.610\nany kind of prerequisite background\nknowledge, some already built\n\n57\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.165\nunderstanding about cloud technologies,\nor are we starting from the ground up?\n\n58\n00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:05.195\n>> Well as far as the cloud technologies\ngo, you really don't have to\n\n59\n00:03:05.195 --> 00:03:09.435\nhave too many of even the fundamentals,\nand we're gonna go over the basics.\n\n60\n00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:12.255\nBut there are some things that are almost\ngonna be assumed knowledge, so\n\n61\n00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:13.970\njust understand that.\n\n62\n00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.928\nWe start mentioning firewalls, you're\ngoing to have to know what a firewall is.\n\n63\n00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:18.070\nIf we mention a network port,\n\n64\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.910\nare you going to have to have all\nof those network ports memorized?\n\n65\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.140\nNo, but you will have to know\nwhat a communication port is.\n\n66\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.810\nYou will have to know what things like\nbring your own device scenarios mean.\n\n67\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.910\nThings like on site,\nthings like off site, or on premise.\n\n68\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.810\nAt least understanding some\nof the terminology here, but\n\n69\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.870\nmostly for the cloud portion of this,\nyou won't really have to know too much.\n\n70\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.400\n>> Now, Wes,\na lot of the series that we tape here, and\n\n71\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.810\nwe share with you good people out there,\nat IT Pro TV, they're exam based, right?\n\n72\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.830\nThey are driven towards\nsome sort of certification.\n\n73\n00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.920\nIs this an example of that type of series?\n\n74\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.450\n>> That's right,\n\n75\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.640\nthis is another one that falls under\nthe umbrella offering at Microsoft.\n\n76\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.300\nMicrosoft Technology Associate.\n\n77\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.070\nAnd they've got a handful\nof them out there, and\n\n78\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.550\nthis another one of the portions\nof that handful, if you will.\n\n79\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.930\nThis is the 98369 MTA Cloud Fundamental\nExam that you'll be taking,\n\n80\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.910\nand that's what we're going to go\nthrough as we go through this.\n\n81\n00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.960\nWe're going to be lining this up with the\nskills measure that you'll see required to\n\n82\n00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.340\npass that exam, and\nit is going to be exam oriented.\n\n83\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.640\n>> Awesome.\nWell it sounds like\n\n84\n00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.830\nthere's a lot of information that's going\nto be covered in these upcoming episodes.\n\n85\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.710\nIt sounds really exciting.\n\n86\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.130\nI'm actually happy to be\na part of this stuff.\n\n87\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.570\nI really enjoy Cloud,\nI know you do as well.\n\n88\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.920\nHopefully if you're watching this,\n\n89\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.500\nthis sounds like something\nthat maybe tickles your fancy.\n\n90\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.010\nOr maybe it's something that you need\nto know as a requirement for your job.\n\n91\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.516\nSo we look forward to you joining\nus in these upcoming episodes, and\n\n92\n00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:48.631\nwe'll see you then.\n\n93\n00:04:48.631 -->
